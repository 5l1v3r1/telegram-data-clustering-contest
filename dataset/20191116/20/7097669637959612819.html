      <h1>Why Russian Fighter Jets Are Threatening NATO In The Baltics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:05:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Mark Episkopos</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>Russia and NATO's military buildup in the Baltics is creating a tense situation. </p>
      <p>In the most recent illustration of ongoing Russia-NATO military tensions over Baltic airspace, recently released <u><a href="https://theaviationist.com/2019/01/31/video-showing-russian-su-27-flanker-turning-into-a-u-s-air-force-f-15c-emerges/">footage</a></u> shows a Russian Su-27 fighter making a sharp turn into an American F-15C.</p>
      <p>It is unclear when the video was filmed, with some speculating that it occured during a prior NATO BAP (Baltic Air Policing) mission. When viewed in that light, this incident seems to fall into the trend of what US officials have previously described as “<u><a href="http://www.c6f.navy.mil/news/us-ep-3-intercepted-black-sea-nov-5-2018-updated-1638-cet">unsafe</a></u>” Russian interceptions and “aggressive maneuvers” in high-tension airspace.</p>
      <p>Russian tactical aircraft in the Baltic region have previously been accused of flying with their <u><a href="http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/5481/message-from-moscow-armed-russian-su-27s-violated-finnish-airspace-twice-in-one-day">transponders</a></u> off, which would certainly compound an already-tense interception. The Russians have levied similar accusations against western aircraft operating in the region; most recently, against an unidentified Swedish Gulfstream surveillance craft <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/video-watch-russias-deadly-su-27-fighter-action-42767">intercepted</a></u> by an Su-27.</p>
      <p>But Russian media and military experts provide an entirely different context, arguing that it was the F-15 that engaged in “provocative” and “reckless” behavior by allegedly intruding on the flight path of a Russian government plane being escorted by the Su-27 in question.</p>
