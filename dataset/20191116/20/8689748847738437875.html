      <p>Her statement has shocked lots of people on Social media after she made the post but it turns out she’s since deleted the post after the backlash but there’s a screenshot to back this story.</p>
      <p>She posted:</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Thanks to everyone who calls me to report my husand Jenkis Shande to me, I really appreciate you all. But that have to stop, I’m not perfect and I will never be perfect in this life. Likewise him and I know that he is a womanizer which I’m okay with it because is none of your fucking business. I’m not interested in knowing if ladies, women or girls are following him or he is following them. Peace of mind is all I need now. So keep your opinion and thoughs to yourself.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Note: All the girls contesting for FFF are beautiful and I’m not supporting anyone of them, so no need for you to dig out stories for me. See you all at the top.”</i>, she wrote.</p>
