      <h1>Astros’ sign-stealing scandal: MLB facing major questions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:51:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author">Ken Davidoff</a></address>
      <p>Imagine if the Patriots dominated the past 18 years of the NFL, tallying equal parts glory and controversy, only they didn’t feature a GOAT quarterback married to a model, a head coach who makes Emperor Palpatine of “Star Wars” fame seem like a softie or a trouble-finding owner who revels in a good public fight.</p>
      <p>That’s why Major League Baseball has an Astros problem it must remedy in swift fashion.</p>
      <p>Just as <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/27/astros-retract-statement-saying-sports-illustrated-fabricated-brandon-taubman-story/">the Brandon Taubman scandal</a> and its ugly aftermath dominated the World Series until the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/31/gusty-nationals-are-deserving-world-series-champions/">Nationals’ remarkable comeback in Houston</a>, you couldn’t stroll more than 10 feet at this past week’s general managers’ meetings without bumping into a non-Astros executive livid with the allegations logged by pitchers Mike Fiers and Danny Farquhar (in The Athletic), and soon after bolstered by video evidence, that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/astros-sign-stealing-angers-yankees-cashmans-jab-2017-player-furious/">the 2017 Astros had utilized an illegal, electronic sign-stealing system</a> at Minute Maid Park.</p>
      <p>Now the Yankees and their fans feel their AL Championship Series loss that season — during which they won all three games at Yankee Stadium and lost all four games at Minute Maid — didn’t result from fair play.</p>
      <p>We’ll get into the ethics, legalities and more, yet the biggest downside to this mess, from a bottom-line perspective, is its lack of upside.</p>

      <p>No evidence exists that the Astros’ rogue persona transcends baseball’s standard audience in a way similar to the Patriots’ graduation into “Saturday Night Live,” bestselling books and enough GIFs to equip a small country. The Pats’ villainy, the questions about their legitimacy thanks to <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/10/12/they-are-cheaters-spygate-the-nfl-scandal-that-started-it-all/">Spygate</a>, <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/05/11/deflategate-verdict-tom-brady-banned-4-games-pats-lose-picks/">Deflategate</a> and the like, draws eyeballs thanks to the larger-than-life stars of the saga in Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft.</p>
      <p>The Astros’ infamy features no such breakout performers, sucking considerable time and energy from their opponents as well as commissioner Rob Manfred’s office without producing any tangible reward.</p>
      <p>In honor of the Astros’ four playoff appearances in the past five seasons under their current leadership group, let’s tackle four prominent questions surrounding this storm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. What would really hurt the Astros and deter future evildoers?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It starts with a loss of draft picks, the lifeline to any team’s hope at sustainability. Lucky for Manfred, he already spelled this out in the memo he sent to clubs in the wake of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/why-astros-could-face-harsher-penalty-amid-cheating-scandal/">the Red Sox’s Apple Watch scandal two-plus years ago</a>, the details of which he publicized on Sept. 15, 2017: “Future violations of this type will be subject to more serious sanctions, including the possible loss of draft picks.”</p>
      <p>Lo and behold, just six days into that future, it sure appears that the Astros committed such violations against Farquhar and the White Sox, which we know thanks to the amazing work of Twitter baseball detective @Jomboy_.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Jomboy_/status/1194348775965437952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Only once since taking over in 2015 has Manfred taken draft picks away from a club, and ironically, the Astros served as the beneficiary there, as the commissioner assigned the Cardinals’ top two draft picks of 2017 to Houston as punishment for St. Louis’ scouting director Christopher Correa hacking into the Astros’ internal database.</p>
      <p>Though that ranks as more egregious — it landed Correa in jail, for crying out loud — Manfred’s warning should speak for itself and provide him all the latitude he requires.</p>
      <p>Then we move onto suspensions. Suspending players will be hairy, in that the Players Association will participate in any effort to discipline the hitters accused of illicit chicanery. Suspending management people, however? Easy like Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Most obviously, Houston’s manager A.J. Hinch and president of baseball operations Jeff Luhnow should be suspended for lengthy periods — half a season, at least — if a preponderance of evidence suggests that they knew what was going down. The fact that 2017 Astros designated hitter Carlos Beltran, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/what-mets-told-carlos-beltran-regarding-sign-stealing-scandal/">an alleged mastermind behind the scheme</a>, now manages the Mets dramatically increases his peril if he doesn’t fully cooperate with MLB investigators. Beltran’s former Mets teammate Alex Cora, the ’17 Astros’ bench coach and now the Red Sox’s manager, also stands as a person of interest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Does the sign-stealing have anything to do with last month’s Taubman imbroglio?</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the surface, you might say no. That’s what Luhnow said this past week at the meetings: “I think these incidents and these different topics are not necessarily tied together.”</p>
      <p>Allow me to submit otherwise: They both reflect an organizational culture of arrogance. The reindeer games of illegal sign-stealing — “club-on-club crime,” as White Sox GM Rick Hahn referred to it — glides all too smoothly into the truly damaging, societal transgressions of Taubman’s harassment and the Astros’ attempted smearing of the journalist (Sports Illustrated’s Stephanie Apstein) who reported that harassment. Just as you can see the through line connecting the Pats’ on-the-field hijinks with Kraft’s recent arrest at a massage parlor.</p>
      <p>Hence the hope here that Manfred — who already was investigating the Astros for their Taubman ineptitude and is open to simply folding the sign-stealing into one macrocosmic investigation — doesn’t let Astros owner Jim Crane skate and hits the team not only with a seven-figure fine, but with a condemnation of that culture — for which Crane, by name, should be held accountable.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Will this open the floodgates to comparable espionage accusations against other teams?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Astros will tell you they’re being unfairly targeted, that every team does this stuff. Well, if any current Astro know of specific wrongdoing by opponents, it’s time for them to chirp.</p>
      <p>It wouldn’t shock if another team or two got dragged into this mess, and remember, we already know about the Red Sox’s love of Apple merch.</p>
      <p>However, I’ll bet that no team winds up in anywhere as much trouble as the Astros. Too much smoke comes from Houston. The Astros can’t be that inept at covering their tracks relative to their contemporaries.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Could and should the 2017 Astros’ championship be taken away, or at least designated with an asterisk?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No and no. This isn’t the NCAA, thank goodness. Retroactive penalties don’t hold up against any intellectual scrutiny. Rather, every result, every statistic, features context — a “taint,” if that helps you — we can discuss as adults without trying to rewrite the past.</p>
      <p>The Yankees’ 1996-2000 dynasty, to identify just one example, featured players known to have used illegal performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
      <p>Maybe the Yankees’ opponents employed just as many or more illegal PED users. Maybe the Astros’ foes actually have been far more clever and discreet in their high-tech codebreaking.</p>
      <p>We can’t know everything. The crooks always will lead the cops, be it in drugs, theft or anything else. All we can do is bring down the hammer on the futures of those who get caught.</p>
