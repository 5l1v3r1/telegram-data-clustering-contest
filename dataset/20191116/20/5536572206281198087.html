      <p>Pat McAfee is a man who knows all about hang-time, as he spent many years in the National Football League booming punts to the opposing teams and celebrating every single good one that he accomplished.</p>
      <p>Now, employed by ESPN, the former West Virginia and Indianapolis Colts punter took his talents to Waco, Texas with the College Gameday crew and had some fun with the fans in attendance.</p>
      <p>After presenting the segment “You Had One Job!”, McAfee officially kicked off college football Saturday with a belly flop jump right into the Brazos River with his suit on and everything.</p>
      <p>“Last time I allegedly did what I’m about to do, I ended up in a jail cell!”</p>
