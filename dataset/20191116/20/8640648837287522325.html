      <p>Six nearby vehicles also were damaged, Jones said, but he was not aware of anyone who was injured.</p>
      <p>Firefighters put out the fire within a few minutes, he said.</p>
      <p>The parking garage — which includes short-term, long-term and employee parking — was initially closed off, Jones said. As of 12:30 p.m., Jones didn’t know if the garage was still closed.</p>
      <p>Clark County Fire Department officials didn’t have further information Saturday afternoon.</p>
