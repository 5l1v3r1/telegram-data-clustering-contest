      <p><b>DAYTON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A former Ohio lawmaker accused of defrauding programs intended for disadvantaged businesses has been sentenced in federal court.</p>
      <p>Former Democratic State Rep. Clayton Luckie, of Dayton, received four months in prison Friday after a judge rejected a probation recommendation from the U.S. attorney and probation department.</p>
      <p>Luckie pleaded guilty in July to mail fraud.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Luckie offered his firm as a front for another company to win work intended for disadvantaged businesses and submitted false invoices for thousands of dollars to the city of Dayton.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Aaron Durden said the sentence came as a shock to Luckie, who sought probation saying his mother and daughter needed him.</p>
      <p>Luckie was released from prison in 2016 after serving three years for convictions on charges that included election falsification.</p>
