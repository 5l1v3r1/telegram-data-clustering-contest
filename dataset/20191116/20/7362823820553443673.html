      <p>“This person MUST have advanced knowledge of of [sic] Photoshop and Lightroom, have experience working with/shooting young children/families and be comfortable acting as Mother’s Helper on days when not shooting/editing.”</p>
      <p>The unique job posting listed the compensation as an hourly or daily rate.</p>
      <p>Reactions on Twitter, where a screenshot of the posting was originally shared, were plentiful.</p>
      <p>“May god have mercy on the soul of the person who takes this job,” tweeted writer Dorsey Shaw. “In the next 5 years NYC creatives will exist only to work on personal media projects for bored wealthy people.”</p>

      <p>“Wth is Mother's Helper,” someone else commented. “The capitalized letters make me uncomfortable with the extra emphasis.”</p>

      <p>“Yes, because what photographer and social media expert doesn’t want to be a mother’s helper on the side,” another person tweeted. “What nonsense.”</p>
      <p>Despite the online attention, it doesn’t appear the family has yet found their coveted social media photographer, coordinator and mother’s helper. The job listing, which was posted 23 days ago, is still up on Craigslist.</p>
