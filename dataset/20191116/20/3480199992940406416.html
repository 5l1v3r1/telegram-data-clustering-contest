      <p>Ryan Giggs welcomed Wales’ 2-0 victory in Azerbaijan by insisting his side have found vital momentum heading into their final Euro 2020 qualifier against Hungary.</p>
      <p>Wales kept alive their automatic qualification hopes with a comfortable win in Baku, Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson scoring first-half goals.</p>
      <p>And Croatia’s 3-1 victory over Slovakia later on Saturday evening meant that Wales will reach the European Championship finals with victory over Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>“The result was what counted, getting that was the priority,” Giggs said.</p>
      <p>“Some of the quality of the play was outstanding, we’ve improved since the Azerbaijan game (2-1 home win in September).</p>
      <p>“We’ve started to gain some momentum, which is not easy in international football.</p>
      <p>“Azerbaijan is not an easy place to come and there was so much on the game that it’s up there with one of my best performances.”</p>

      <p>Giggs also had the benefit of giving game-time to star players Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey after their recent injury problems.</p>
      <p>Bale had not played for over a month after suffering a thigh injury, but the Real Madrid forward got nearly an hour under his belt.</p>
      <p>Juventus playmaker Ramsey replaced Bale to make his first Wales appearance in nearly a year.</p>
      <p>“We’ve still got to assess it before Tuesday,” Giggs said.</p>

      <p>“Getting Gareth off pretty early and getting Aaron some minutes as well was important, When Aaron came on he showed his quality.</p>
      <p>“It’s a quick turnaround and Gareth was blowing a little bit, which you can expect.</p>
      <p>“But hopefully I’ll have the option to start both on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“We had to do our job, we’ve done it and tried put a little bit of pressure on Slovakia.”</p>

      <p>On Wales’ upturn in form, Giggs added: “I would say we’ve had four good performances in a row, with the Belarus friendly.</p>
      <p>“Slovakia and Croatia are top opposition and we played well. It’s what we needed after the two difficult games in the summer.</p>
      <p>“We needed to be strong and we have been. We really dug in deep against Croatia.</p>
      <p>“I was not happy with the amount of corners we kept giving away here, but in open play they never really troubled us and we could have scored a few more goals as well.”</p>

      <p>Azerbaijan have yet to win in Euro 2020 qualifying and have picked up only one point from seven matches.</p>
      <p>Manager Nikola Jurcevic said: “Wales deserved to win this game because they were the better team.</p>
      <p>“We conceded goals from set-pieces, not for the first time against very big players.</p>
      <p>“We had lots of set-pieces ourselves but the big difference between us and Wales was that they were really dangerous from theirs.”</p>
