      <p>Teigen wasn’t too fussed that the singer was stealing her husband’s awards.</p>
      <p>“Take them all! You deserve 10 more!!” she replied.</p>

      <p>Shockingly, Sia has been nominated for nine Grammys and has never won. She does hold a number of wins at the APRA and ARIA Music Awards.</p>
      <p>Legend has been nominated 29 times with 10 wins.</p>
