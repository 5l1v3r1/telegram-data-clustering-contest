      <h1>New Tory candidate Louise Calland slammed for role with 'greedy' big pharma company</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Louise Calland is selected as Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorks, in the forthcoming election, but her role with Novartis is worrying Labour rival Jon Trickett</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:22:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Chris McLaughlin</a></address>
      <p>A Tory candidate has been slammed for working for a big pharma firm accused of ripping off the NHS.</p>
      <p>Louise Calland, selected last week, is government affairs manager at Novartis, which last year tried to force huge hikes in the cost of vital drugs.</p>
      <p>The Swiss-based firm launched a High Court action last year to make doctors in the North East use its brand Lucentis, which costs around £551 per jab, rather than the standard medication Avastin, at £28 per jab.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of patients with age-related macular degeneration could have been affected if the bid had not failed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> claims the court’s decision to throw it out could save the NHS £100million a year.</p>

      <p>Ms Calland is a member of Tory-controlled Wandsorth council in south London. </p>
      <p>Ms Calland, who advises the firm on public sector policy and relations with ministers, is the Tory candidate in the seat of Hemsworth, West Yorks, held at the last election by Labour’s Jon Trickett with a majority of 10,174.</p>
      <p>Mr Trickett said: “We’re talking about money for more beds, nurses and medicine for those who need it.</p>
      <p>"This Tory candidate doesn’t seem to care about the needs of the NHS or the area.</p>
      <p>"Yorkshire isn’t a playground for aspiring politicians who think they can just come up here for a while and take the train home to their day jobs and council seats in London.”</p>

      <p>Announcing her candidacy, Ms Calland pledged to “make a difference” to the lives of Hemsworth constituents.</p>
      <p>But Labour claims she is not a serious candidate and remains wedded to London politics.</p>
      <p>Ms Calland, who grew up in Surrey, has declared on social media that she is “passionate about keeping the village and community feeling of our town centres in London”.</p>
      <p>Ms Calland told the Sunday People: “My candidacy and my work...are separate.</p>
      <p>“I am committed to this election campaign and would make the constituency my home if I win.”</p>
