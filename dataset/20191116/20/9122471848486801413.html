      <h1>Nick Saban Offers Injury Update For Tua Tagovailoa After Mississippi State Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:33:40+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier Saturday afternoon, Alabama star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa left the game against Mississippi State with an apparent injury.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa scrambled to his left and was hit by two Mississippi State defenders. His helmet popped off and his face could be seen covered in blood.</p>
      <p>However, the more serious injury appears to be to Tua’s hip.</p>
      <p>According to multiple reports, Tua is being transported by <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/tua-tagovailoa-hospital-in-a-helicopter">helicopter to a hospita</a>l in Birmingham. That by itself shows the severity of the injury.</p>
      <p>After the game, head coach Nick Saban revealed Tua suffered what could be a “serious” injury.</p>

      <p>In the post-game press conference, Saban said “godspeed” to Tua and his family.</p>

      <p>Earlier this morning, ESPN analyst Tim Tebow suggested Tua should not play in today’s game. After Tua suffered the injury, media from all around the country chimed in, ripping Saban for the decision to leave Tagovailoa in the game.</p>
      <p>While he left the game with an injury, he was clearly healthy enough to start the game. Tagovailoa completed 14-of-18 passing for 256 yards and two touchdowns in the first half before he left the game.</p>
      <p>With the win over Mississippi State on Saturday, Alabama improved to 9-1 on the year. Backup quarterback Mac Jones took over in the second half and completed 7 of 11 passes for 94 yards in the win.</p>
