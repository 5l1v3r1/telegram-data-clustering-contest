      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/malta/">Malta</a> coach Ray Farrugia has admitted he can’t remember the closing stages of his side’s thrashing to Spain after appearing to knock himself out in the dug-out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/spain-national-team/">Spain</a> battered Malta 7-0 in their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/euro-2020/">Euro 2020</a> qualifier in Cadiz in what was a painful watch for the Maltese coaching staff and fans.</p>
      <p>But Farrugia caused himself some physical pain when he stood up in the dug-out and cracked his head.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old needed medical attention with TV cameras catching blood coming from his head as the medical staff patched Farrugia up.</p>

      <p>‘Of the last 20 minutes, I don’t remember hardly anything,’ Farrugia said in the post-match press conference, sporting a bandage on his head.</p>
      <p>‘We played against the best team in the world, I have no doubt about that. On top of that we conceded four goals from corner kicks.</p>

      <p>‘Spain are better than us, undoubtedly, and I think that with those players they can win the European Championship. And I watch a lot of football.’</p>

      <p>The result confirms Spain as Group F winners with seven different scorers in their game against Malta.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/santi-cazorla/">Santi Cazorla</a> scored his first goal for Spain in four years, while Alvaro Morata, Pau Torres, Pablo Sarabia, Dani Olmo, Gerard Moreno and Jesus Navas were also on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>The goal marks another huge moment for Cazorla who spent <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/21/arsenal-confirm-santi-cazorla-left-club-7566009/">two years on the sidelines after multiple operations on his ankle</a>.</p>
      <p>Cazorla’s last strike for Spain came in a 2-0 friendly win over England in November 2015.</p>
