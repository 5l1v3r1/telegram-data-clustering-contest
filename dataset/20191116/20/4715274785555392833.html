      <p>Singapore—RedDoorz, Southeast Asia’s largest and fastest-growing hotel management and booking platform, recently announced several new leadership appointments, further bolstering its regional team as the firm eyes significant growth in 2020. </p>
      <p>Jupe Tsui, previously CFO of Oriente and Regional Finance Director for booking.com, has been appointed as Chief Financial Officer, and Liviu Nedef, former Head of Marketing at HOOQ has joined as SVP of Marketing.</p>
      <p>“RedDoorz has grown five-times in size in the last 12 months and we intend to continue to drive significant growth in 2020,” said Amit Saberwal, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of RedDoorz. “Creating more robust commercialization strategies, taking greater control of our operational costs, developing impactful brand campaigns, and enhancing end-user experiences enriched with emerging technologies requires an experienced team with a depth of experience in their respective fields to ensure we are solving for both the current and future needs of our business.”</p>
      <p>As Chief Financial Officer for RedDoorz, Tsui will be responsible for refining and implementing RedDoorz’s financial growth strategy, as well as implementing new financial initiatives. He brings with him almost 30 years of experience from some of the world’s largest multinational companies. </p>
      <p>Most recently, he served as Regional CFO for Oriente, an innovative technology and data-science company committed to unlocking financial inclusion for underserved communities in emerging Asia. </p>
      <p>He was also Regional Finance Director for Booking.com, where he was instrumental in transforming a 150-person finance organisation to help drive exponential growth for four consecutive years. He joins RedDoorz at a time of unprecedented growth. </p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a company that is not only disrupting an old and archaic industry, but that’s doing so with such focus and determination for the benefit of the customer and small hotel owners across the region,” said Tsui. “I look forward to leading the RedDoorz financial team through this, and the next period of rapid growth.”</p>
      <p>Nedef has assumed responsibilities in a newly formed role as the Group Senior Vice President of Marketing. His mission will be to make RedDoorz the leading affordable hotel brand in Southeast Asia. </p>
      <p>Liviu brings almost 15 years of experience, having led marketing functions for high growth digital, content and e-commerce brands including HOOQ and Lazada. </p>
      <p>“RedDoorz is an exciting company that is redefining the travel accommodation space for millions of people in Southeast Asia. I’m thrilled to join Amit and the team with the important task of building brand perception, amplifying our stories and delivering a new perspective to consumers around the region. Our brand has a vision that’s easily relatable and translates well across the region and I look forward to help propel RedDoorz forward during our next phase of growth.”</p>
      <p> Saberwal added: “These appointments bolster our leadership team to accelerate RedDoorz’s regional growth. At a time of tremendous change in the travel and hospitality landscape, we are reinforcing our position as a leading industry disrupter, serving our customers and hotel partners with the best thinking, the best people and innovative technology.”</p>
      <p>RedDoorz Philippines’ Country Manager Stefanie Irma welcomed the new appointments, saying they would help boost the growth of RedDoorz in the Philippines as well. “RedDoorz already currently leads the affordable hotel chain industry in the country with more than 200 properties in more than 20 cities nationwide. The expertise of the new regional team members will help propel RedDoorz forward and help us reach our 2020 vision, which is to have 300 properties by the end of 2019. The Philippines is the second largest RedDoorz market in the region as a very important market and will certainly drive future growth,” Irma said.</p>
      <p> RedDoorz achieved a number of significant milestones in 2019, including its first close of US$70 million as part of its larger Series C funding round. The firm has raised approximately US$140 million since its inception in 2015. In addition, it is the first hotel chain to secure 600,000 occupied room nights per-month within the Southeast Asia affordable accommodation vertical in September 2019. The firm is on track to achieve one million occupied room nights in a single month by December 2019. </p>
      <p> Across the region, RedDoorz currently operates a network of more than 1,500 properties in over 120 cities spanning Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, and Vietnam. RedDoorz will also be increasing its footprint in Southeast Asia by entering Thailand in 2020.</p>
