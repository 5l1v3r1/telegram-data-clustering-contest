      <p>ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) - The family and friends of Alexis Crawford gathered in Athens, Georgia, on Saturday to honor the memory of the 21-year-old Clark Atlanta University student who police say was killed by her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend.</p>
      <p>"This is not going to be about how she died or the evil that took her," said Rev. Markel Hutchins. "Today we're going to celebrate Alexis Crawford's life."</p>
      <p>The funeral was originally supposed to be at Hill Chapel Baptist Church in Athens, Crawford's hometown. But the service was moved to Cornerstone Church to accommodate everyone who wanted attend.</p>
      <p>Congregants packed the church, shared their memories of Crawford and prayed for her family. The Clark Atlanta University choir sang gospel music.</p>
      <p>One friend fondly recalled how she and Crawford would talk about their future and their dreams, how they'd be rich and have big houses.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to live our dreams that we made together and make you proud," she said. "Because at the end of the day, Lex was my sister. And I loved her like one."</p>
      <h3>Suspects confessed to the murders, police say</h3>
      <p>The suspects in Crawford's death have been identified by the Atlanta Police Department as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/10/us/clark-atlanta-university-student-alexis-crawford/index.html">her roommate, Jordyn Jones</a>, and Jones' boyfriend, Barron Brantley.</p>
      <p>According to police, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/us/clark-atlanta-university-student-alexis-crawford/index.html">Brantley strangled Crawford to death</a> sometime in the early morning hours of October 31.</p>
      <p>Crawford and Jones had gotten into a "physical altercation," and Brantley got involved, according to court documents. "As a result of the physical altercation, Barron Brantley choked the victim until she was deceased," according to the documents.</p>
      <p>Jones and Brantley then put Crawford in a plastic bin and left it in a Dekalb County park, the documents say, where her body was found on November 8. Jones and Brantley confessed to the crime that day, the documents state.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/us/missing-clark-atlanta-univeristy-student/index.html">Days before she vanished</a>, Crawford <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/us/clark-atlanta-student-found-dead/index.html">filed a police report</a> that described unwanted kissing and touching from Brantley, police said.</p>
      <p>Brantley has been charged with murder along with three probation violations and "hindering person making emergency telephone call," according to the Fulton County Jail. Jones faces a murder charge.</p>
      <p>Brantley and Jones waived their initial court appearances on Monday. Their court-appointed public defenders have not responded to CNN's requests for comment.</p>
      <p>In the past, Jones had spent holidays with Crawford's family, Hutchins, a spokesman for Crawford's family, previously told CNN in an interview. Sometimes, Crawford had called Jones her "best friend."</p>
      <p>"To know that someone that they welcomed into their homes played a role in Alexis' death is all the more hurtful," Hutchins said.</p>
