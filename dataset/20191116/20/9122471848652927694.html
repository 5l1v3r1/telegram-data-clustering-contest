      <h1>Paul Finebaum Reacts To Tua Tagovailoa’s Injury vs. Mississippi State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:47:45+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier Saturday afternoon, Alabama star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa left the game against Mississippi State with an apparent injury. Tagovailoa scrambled to his left and was hit by two Mississippi State defenders.</p>
      <p>Head coach Nick Saban revealed Tua is dealing with a hip injury, though further details are unknown at this time. SEC reporter Cecil Hurt reported Tua is being transported by <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/tua-tagovailoa-hospital-in-a-helicopter">helicopter to a hospita</a>l in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>After the game, ESPN college football analyst Paul Finebaum weighed in on the loss of Tua, despite the win for Alabama.</p>
      <p>“This may be the most heartbreaking 31-point victory in Alabama football history,” Finebaum said.</p>

      <p>With the win over Mississippi State on Saturday, Alabama improved to 9-1 on the year. Backup quarterback Mac Jones took over in the second half and completed 7 of 11 passes for 94 yards in the win.</p>
      <p>However, losing Tua will likely hurt Alabama’s chances at a possible run at the College Football Playoff. The Crimson Tide face off against FCS program Western Carolina before their regular season-finale against Auburn.</p>
      <p>If Alabama wins out, it has a chance to make the playoff – which the Tide have never missed.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest on Tua’s injury and how it impacts Alabama moving forward.</p>
