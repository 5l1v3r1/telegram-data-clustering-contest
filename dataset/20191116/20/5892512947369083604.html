      <p>The bare knuckle brutality will return this evening (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at Bare Knuckle FC 9 live on <a href="https://www.bareknuckle.tv/orderppv">FITE.TV PPV</a> from Biloxi, Mississippi, as Artem Lobov puts his undefeated BKFC record on the line in a main event rematch opposite fellow UFC veteran Jason Knight.</p>
      <p>This will be a reboot from their initial meeting back in April, which “Russian Hammer” won via decision. The five-round bout produced <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/4/7/18299034/post-fight-pictures-lobov-knight-bare-knuckle-fc-5-brutal-cuts-lacerations">one of the bloodiest outcomes</a> you may ever see in combat sports.</p>
      <p>In advance to the highly-anticipated rematch between Lobov and Knight, fight fans are now able to relive Lobov’s June meeting with former boxing world champion Paulie Malignaggi. While Malignaggi originally clashed with Lobov’s main training partner, former UFC champion Conor McGregor, “Magic Man” eventually beefed with Lobov and ended up crossing over to the bare knuckle ring at BKFC 6.</p>
      <p>While the anticipated meeting failed to deliver both in terms of viewership and overall action, Lobov proved that MMA strikers can stand and deliver with world-class boxers, winning a five-round unanimous decision. Malignaggi was obviously out of his fighting prime, but Lobov still landed the better shots and did what he needed to do to escape victorious and set up the rematch with Knight.</p>
      <p>In case you missed any of the action between Lobov and Malignaggi it can be seen in the above video player, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCoIjCG-Nng">The Mac Life</a>.</p>
      <p>We will find out later tonight if Lobov can keep things rolling and lock down his third-straight victory in bare knuckle boxing, which is a win streak “Russian Hammer” failed to accomplish in professional MMA since 2013.</p>
