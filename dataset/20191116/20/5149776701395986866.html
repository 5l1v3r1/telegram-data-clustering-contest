        <b>Notts County were beaten 3-0 by Barrow this afternoon as the Magpies suffered defeat at Meadow Lane for the first time since August.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Here Pareem Vara looked at the duel between Dior Angus and Ben Turner and how it impacted a disappointing result.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was an interesting battle throughout the game between former Premier League centre-half, Ben Turner and summer signing Dior Angus. Barrow started with a clear tactic, to use the pace of Angus to get in behind the County defender, which worked perfectly for Barrowâ€™s second goal.</p>
      <p>The game was swung just 13 minutes into the match after Barrow doubled their, thanks to an assist from Dior Angus. He ran in behind Turner and just beat the on-rushing Sam Slocombe to the ball before squaring it to John Rooney for a tap in.</p>
      <p>Following the two quick Barrow goals, Turner used his experience and allowed the centre forward little space to manoeuvre and work in behind, winning every aerial battle as Barrow defender Connor Brown continued to look for Angus with the ball in-behind.</p>
      <p>During a somewhat bleak and boring second half, it was more of the same from both players, both putting their very different set of skills against each other.</p>

      <p>Angus did one have one last chance in the second just before he was substituted.</p>
      <p>He found himself one-on-one with Slocombe after a superb pass from Rooney.</p>
      <p>Slocombe made a great save to stop the initial shot but the ball seemed to be trickling into the net, before Turner got there to clear the ball off the line and prevent Angus scoring.</p>
      <p>Barrow scored their third to round off a miserable performance at Meadow Lane from the Magpies who need to bounce back against Aldershot Town next week.</p>
