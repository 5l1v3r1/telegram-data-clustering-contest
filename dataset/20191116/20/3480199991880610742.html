      <p>The pair were given a score of 37 for their performance of the American smooth.</p>
      <p>Shirley Ballas and Bruno Tonioli revealed their 10s after the dance at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom, sparking pandemonium,</p>
      <p>Du Beke ran around the interview platform in delight that he had broken his scoring duck.</p>
      <p>Craig Revel Horwood said of the dance: “Beautiful movement around the floor, elegant, graceful.”</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse told Barton: “I think that was the best since you started Strictly.”</p>
      <p>Du Beke has been involved with the show since 2004, and has never won the show.</p>
