      <p>BJP MLA M P Renukacharya again had a narrow escape when the 'Hori', the caparisoned bull, ran amok soon after he touched it at Honnalli in Davangere district on Friday.</p>
      <p>This is the second time he has had the close shave.</p>
      <p>On August 31, Renukacharya was about to be hit by the Hori.</p>
      <p>The Hori Habba (Hori festival)is celebrated in which a well-decorated bull is made to run through the crowd The challenge is to subdue the animal and snatch the dry coconut, cash and other valuables tied to it.</p>
      <p>In Honnalli, the organisers invited Renukacharya who obliged.</p>
      <p>Before setting the Hori on the crowd, the organisers asked the MLA to worship it.</p>
      <p>As soon as he touched it, the bull jumped and lowered its head as if it to butt.</p>
      <p>Sensing the danger, Renukacharyas bodyguards encircled him and took him to safety away from the place.</p>
      <p>Nothing has happened to me.</p>
      <p>I am fine, said Renukacharya after the incident.</p>
