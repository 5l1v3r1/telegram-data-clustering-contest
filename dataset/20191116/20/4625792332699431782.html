      <h1>Bill Gates tops Jeff Bezos as richest person in the world</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:32:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates reclaimed the world’s richest person mantle from Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.</p>
      <p>The ranking was released Friday by the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>, which gave Gates, 64, a net worth of $110 billion. Bezos, 55, sat just below him with a $109 billion net worth.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon’s recent decision to dgrant a $10 billion cloud-computing contract to Microsoft rather than Amazon may have been a factor in the news, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/gates-tops-bezos-as-world-s-richest-person-with-amazon-slide">according to Bloomberg</a>. Shares of Microsoft increased 4% since the decision was made public in October. On the other hand, Amazon’s stock is down about 2% since the announcement.</p>
      <p>Bezos would be far wealthier if he and his ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos hadn’t divorced, however. MacKenzie Bezos, 49, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bezos-ex-wife-to-give-away-half-her-35b-divorce-settlement">received more than $35 billion</a> in the divorce settlement. She pledged to donate half of it to charity.</p>
      <p>Gates has also made a dent in his wealth through his philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated more than $35 billion to charity since 1994.</p>
