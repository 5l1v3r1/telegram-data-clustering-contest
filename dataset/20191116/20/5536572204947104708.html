      <h1>Trevor Lawrence Met His TikTok Doppelgänger Before Wake Forest Game (PIC)</h1>

      <p>There aren’t too many people in the country who can play the quarterback position quite like Trevor Lawrence, but there is at least one person who looks like him.</p>
      <p>That led to one young lady sharing a TikTok video highlighting the fact that she looks exactly like the Tigers star QB.</p>
      <p>Lawrence certainly thought it was funny, saying, “She does look like me.”</p>

      <p>That video was of Bella Martina — a 16-year-old girl from Alpharetta, Georgia.</p>
      <p>Just ahead of the Tigers’ game against Wake Forest — Lawrence and Bella finally met.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what I would say to him (if we ever met) because I don’t know how he would react,” Martina said to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1359206/2019/11/07/clemson-football-trevor-lawrence-impressions-meet-girl-gone-viral/">The Athletic</a>. “I’d be like, ‘Hi! My name is Bella. You’ve seen my TikToks. We have the same face.’ I’d be so overwhelmed. I might just squeal.”</p>

      <p>“Everybody was like, ‘Oh my gosh. It’s kind of scary the accuracy.’”</p>
