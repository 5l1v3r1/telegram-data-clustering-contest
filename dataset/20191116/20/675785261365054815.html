      <p>An elderly couple who squirted their next-door neighbour with a hosepipe have admitted assault.</p>
      <p>Barry and Hellyne Lee, both 72, were caught on camera soaking 71-year-old Harold Burrows.</p>
      <p>A court heard Mr Lee mocked Mr Burrows, saying: “He likes getting wet, this little man.”</p>
      <p>The Lees are in a long-running dispute with former friend Harold and his wife Jean, 70.</p>
      <p>The row flared when they were cleaning their drive and waste water ran on the Burrows’ property in Denbigh, North Wales.</p>
      <p>The Lees were summoned to Llandudno Magistrates Court on Friday where they admitted common assault. They were each given a two-year restraining order and 12-month conditional discharges.</p>

      <p>The row flared when waste water ran on to Harold’s property when the Lees were cleaning their drive.</p>
      <p>Their lawyer Robert Vickery told JPs: “This is certainly, in my nearly 40 years experience, the first time I have ever dealt with an assault by water from a hosepipe.”</p>

      <p>The court was told Harold and charity shop volunteer wife Jean, 70, had been involved in a lengthy dispute with the Lees.</p>
      <p>Jean was said to have been branded a ‘witch’ and a ‘moron’ - and police mediation with the former pals had failed.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Ms Galston added: “The incident has had a huge effect on Mr and Mrs Burrows.”</p>

      <p>After the hearing Harold said: “It’s been a nightmare living next door. I will be glad when they sell up.”</p>
      <p>Jean added: “We just want to live in peace. We have a nice home and want to stay there.”</p>
