      <h4>Top 25 games</h4>
      <p>In order of game time, with College Football Playoff rankings; lines courtesy Caesars Sportsbook</p>
      <p><b>UCLA at No. 7 Utah</b><br/><b>Time:</b> 8 p.m. ET<br/><b>How to watch:</b> Fox<br/><b>Line:</b> Utah - 21.5<br/><b>And our best line:</b> Utah has an 85% chance to win the Pac-12 South and a 32% chance to win the conference, according to the AllState Playoff Predictor. UCLA is clinging to a 2% chance to win the division and just a 0.1% chance to win the conference.</p>
      <p><b>New Mexico at No. 21 Boise State</b><br/><b>Time:</b> 10:15 p.m. ET<br/><b>How to watch:</b> ESPN2 and ESPN app<br/><b>Line:</b> Boise State -28<br/><b>And our best line:</b> Boise State currently has an 89% chance to win the Mountain division and a 75% chance to win the Mountain West, according to FPI.</p>
      <p><b>Arizona at No. 6 Oregon</b><br/><b>Time:</b> 10:30 p.m. ET<br/><b>How to watch:</b> ESPN and ESPN app<br/><b>Line:</b> Oregon -27.5<br/><b>And our best line:</b> The Ducks have a 31% chance to reach the College Football Playoff, the best of any Pac-12 team and fifth best of any school in FBS. Oregon can become the first Pac-12 team to make the CFP multiple times since it began in 2014.</p>
      <h4>What the games mean</h4>
      <p><b>No. 2 Ohio State 56, Rutgers 21</b><br/>Let's be honest: The only question was whether the Buckeyes would cover. (In a bit of an upset, they did not.) Rutgers was mostly overwhelmed, Justin Fields went over 300 passing yards for the first time, JK Dobbins went without a second-half carry for the fourth time, Chase Young finished his suspension, no key players got hurt, and now, with the formalities out of the way, it's time to gear up for Ohio State-Penn State. -- <i>Bill Connelly</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 3 Clemson 52, Wake Forest 3</b><br/>The Tigers did what they have done over the past six games -- dominate an overmatched ACC opponent with relative ease. This time, the domination came against one of the better teams in the league in Wake Forest. Once again, Clemson pulled its starters before the fourth quarter even began. Trevor Lawrence threw four touchdown passes, and he has zero interceptions since throwing two in the first quarter against Louisville on Oct. 19. This is Clemson's sixth game with 50 or more points this season, most in the FBS. Meanwhile, the defense shut down the No. 2 offense in the ACC. After an open date, the Tigers play rival South Carolina. The idea will be the same -- win that plus the ACC championship game and they are back in the playoff. -- <i>Andrea Adelson</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 5 Alabama 38, Mississippi State 7</b><br/>Alabama scored an easy, and very costly, win in Starkville. The Tide bolted to a 35-7 lead in the second quarter and cruised, but the obvious story wasn't the result. Tua Tagovailoa suffered a hip injury late in the first half, then Bama's star defensive lineman, Raekwon Davis, went down as well. Their status is all that matters with two regular season games left and the Tide still immersed in the national title hunt. -- <i>Bill Connelly</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 20 Iowa 23, No. 8 Minnesota 19</b><br/>The offense Hawkeye fans waited for all season finally showed up. An aggressive, creative and balanced approach gave Iowa a nice first-half lead against unbeaten Minnesota. Senior quarterback Nate Stanley passed the ball with confidence, and Iowa finally wised up and used dynamic freshman Tyler Goodson (94 yards, 1 TD) as its featured back. Although the Hawkeyes defense struggled with Minnesota's talented receivers, pressure from A.J. Epenesa, Kristian Welch and others did enough to slow down the Gophers. Why it took so long for Iowa to perform like this will linger throughout the offseason, but the Hawkeyes kept the Floyd of Rosedale trophy and notched a signature win.</p>
      <p>A one-dimensional offense and a defense that started too slowly led to Minnesota's first loss, which likely ends its playoff chances. P.J. Fleck's team didn't wilt at Kinnick Stadium, by far the toughest environment the Gophers have seen this season, but they couldn't convert yards into points, generate a run game or contain a more balanced Iowa offense with a hot quarterback in Stanley. Minnesota's miscues in the red zone proved especially costly. The Gophers remain in good shape to win their first West Division title but likely must beat rival Wisconsin on Nov. 30 at TCF Bank Stadium. -- <i>Adam Rittenberg</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 9 Penn State 34, Indiana 27</b><br/>The Nittany Lions strung together a gritty, 18-play scoring drive that ate 9:01 off the clock late in the fourth quarter to beat a much-improved Indiana team and keep their playoff hopes alive. PSU can now focus on Ohio State -- the most important remaining regular-season game for both teams, as it will decide the East winner. ESPN's FPI gives PSU a 15.9% chance to win, but an upset would catapult it right back into the conversation. -- <i>Heather Dinich</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 11 Florida 23, Missouri 6</b><br/>It took a while for the Gators to get going offensively in a win over Missouri but there were definite bright spots, including the continued development of <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4034946/kyle-trask">Kyle Trask</a> -- who has now thrown two touchdown passes in eight straight games, the longest streak by a Florida player since Tim Tebow in 2008 (10 straight). The defense had another big game, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3916409/jonathan-greenard">Jonathan Greenard</a> appeared to be rounding back into form with two sacks and five tackles for loss. The Gators have an open date to prepare for rival Florida State, where they will try for back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time since 2008-2009. -- <i>Andrea Adelson</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 14 Wisconsin 37, Nebraska 21</b><br/>The Badgers stayed within striking distance of Minnesota in the Big Ten West by winning 37-21 at Nebraska. It was the <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4242335/jonathan-taylor">Jonathan Taylor</a> show once again, as the star tailback ran 25 times for 204 yards with two touchdowns. It was the third time Taylor ran for 200 yards or more against the Cornhuskers. He has 11 career games with at least 200 yards, which ties Ron Dayne, Ricky Williams and Marcus Allen for the most in FBS history, according to data from ESPN Stats &amp; Information. With 5,634 career rushing yards, Taylor passed 1982 Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker's NCAA record for most rushing yards by a player through his junior season. Walker had 5,596 yards from 1980-82. -- <i>Mark Schlabach</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 15 Michigan 44, Michigan State 10</b><br/>Michigan moved to 8-2 with an improving offense and only Indiana and Ohio State remaining on the schedule. That rivalry game against the Buckeyes is a lot more intriguing than it looked at the beginning of the season, but Indiana is no pushover. The Wolverines will need similar performances out of quarterback Shea Patterson, who threw for more than 350 yards. -- <i>Tom VanHaaren</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 16 Notre Dame 52, No. 23 Navy 20</b><br/>The Fighting Irish have found another gear. Since the blowout loss to Michigan and a funky, narrow win against Virginia Tech, Notre Dame has beaten Duke and Navy by a combined 90-27. They put up 300 yards and 38 points in the first half and cruised. Finish strong against BC and Stanford, and the Irish could be in position for New Year's Six bowl, not a bad consolation considering how dire things looked in Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>Navy's first game as a ranked team in more than two years couldn't possibly have started worse: The Midshipmen lost fumbles on their first two possessions, Notre Dame scored touchdowns on four of its first 17 plays, and that was that. The good news: It wasn't a conference game. Ken Niumatalolo's squad will now prepare to rebound against SMU in a game that, depending on how Memphis is faring, could still have AAC West title implications. -- <i>Bill Connelly</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 18 Memphis 45, Houston 27</b><br/>The Tigers got off to a slow start, but outscored Houston 35-3 in the second and third quarters to remain in contention for a New Year's Six bowl bid. Memphis outgained Houston 531-256 in total yards, and held the Cougars to 99 rushing yards. As long as Memphis avoids an upset at South Florida on Saturday, the Tigers will have a chance to take the lead in the NY6 race if they can end the regular season with a win against Cincinnati. -- <i>Heather Dinich</i></p>
      <p><b>Iowa State 23, No. 19 Texas 21</b><br/>The Longhorns' appearance in the CFP top 25 might be fleeting, as they were stunned by unranked Iowa State's game-winning field goal as time expired. It was the Cyclones' first win against Texas since 2015. It's not going to get any easier, as Texas is at Baylor on Saturday, and ESPN's FPI gives the Longhorns a 37% chance to win. If Texas does fall out of the ranking, it will impact the playoff résumés of both Baylor and Oklahoma. -- <i>Heather Dinich</i></p>
      <p><b>No. 22 Oklahoma State 31, Kansas 13</b><br/>The Cowboys have quietly won three games in a row to climb up the Big 12 standings, the latest a 31-13 decision over Kansas. Tailback <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4241416/chuba-hubbard">Chuba Hubbard</a> ran for 122 yards with two touchdowns on 23 carries. It was his seventh game this season with at least 100 rushing yards and two touchdowns, which is second-most in a season in Big 12 history, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information. Texas' Ricky Williams had eight such games in 1997. OSU's defense turned in one of its better performances of the season, limiting the Jayhawks to only 290 total yards, including 39 rushing. The Pokes also picked off three passes. -- <i>Mark Schlabach</i></p>
      <p><b>West Virginia 24, No. 24 Kansas State 20</b><br/>The Wildcats' first "bad" loss of the season came courtesy of West Virginia, a squad that had just one conference win before coming into the Little Apple. The loss, the Wildcats' second straight after falling at Texas a week ago, virtually wipes away any outside shot the Wildcats may have had at sneaking into a Big 12 title game. Two turnovers and too many mistakes spelled doom for a K-State team that was better in most other statistical categories on Saturday. -- <i>Sam Khan Jr.</i></p>
