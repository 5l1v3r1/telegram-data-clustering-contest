      <p>Eyebrows were raised when goalkeeper Tony Breeden stepped up to take a penalty for Nuneaton Borough and – like the ball he struck – they continued to rise afterwards.</p>
      <p>Looking to break the deadlock for the non-league side in the 61st minute, Breeden blasted the spot kick over the bar and straight into a light in the stands.</p>

      <p>Luke Dillam, 17, filmed the moment and told the PA news agency: “The penalty was given, I thought okay we can break the deadlock here with this goal, but then the goalie takes the ball off the striker and places it down.</p>
      <p>“He skies it, and at first I didn’t see the light break until I re-watched the video, then the light was just hanging down from the roof.</p>
      <p>“I laughed a lot about it and it is still funny now.”</p>

      <p>Fortunately for Breeden his club confirmed no-one was hurt by the damaged light, and they still played on to victory over Stratford Town.</p>
      <p>But, according to his Twitter account, the goalie was still suitably sheepish.</p>

      <p>The club told PA the light is still waiting to be repaired and suggested Breeden is usually an accurate penalty taker.</p>
      <p>“(We are) disappointed but from his track record of penalties we know he is very consistent,” they said.</p>
      <p>“However we are grateful Callum Powell tucked away the second one.”</p>
      <p>Nuneaton went on to win the National League North match 2-0 against Stratford.</p>
