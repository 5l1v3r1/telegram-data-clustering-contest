      <p>An 8-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland">Maryland</a> boy has been offering <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/homeless-crisis">homeless</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/veterans">veterans</a> a helping hand with "hero bags" he fills with clothes, hygiene products and bedding, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Tyler Stallings has been on a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/abandoned-puppy-tail-between-eyes-missouri">mission</a> to help vets in need since he was 4, <a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/7-year-old-boy-has-helped-thousands-of-veterans-after-watching-a-video-about-homelessness/">ABC’s "Good Morning America</a>" reported Friday.</p>
      <p>“He saw videos of veterans holding signs (and) no one responding to their cry for help and he thought this isn’t right. He didn’t like it,” Andrea Blackstone said of her son, according to "GMA." “He asked me, ‘If they’re heroes why should they be on the street?’”</p>

      <p>Once a year on Veterans Day, Tyler would gather clothes and hygiene products in care packages to give to homeless veterans, "GMA" reported.</p>
      <p>With success, Tyler expanded his efforts.</p>
      <p>He’s become an ambassador and resident “superhero” at the Maryland Center of Veteran Education and Training and has raised over $50,000 on behalf of homeless veterans, "GMA" reported.</p>
