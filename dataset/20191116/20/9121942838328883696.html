      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Former Vice President Joe Biden brought an alarmist warning to a diverse crowd of Democrats in early-caucus Nevada during a town hall at an elementary school in a historically minority Las Vegas neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Biden opened a town hall event Saturday saying that as long as Donald Trump is president, the security and future of the United States is at risk.</p>
      <p>With fewer than 100 days before Nevada Democratic party caucuses, Biden is among the front-runners in crowded field of candidates for president.</p>
      <p>His evening appearance drew more than 250 people a day before Biden and most other Democratic presidential candidates are due to attend a campaign event at a Las Vegas resort.</p>
      <p>Answering the first question, about poverty, he drew applause saying the minimum wage should be $15 an hour.</p>
