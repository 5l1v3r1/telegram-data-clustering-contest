      <h1>'Wheel of Fortune' host Pat Sajak vows surgery recovery will be 'complete and relatively fast'</h1>

      <p>"Wheel of Fortune" host Pat Sajak is home from the hospital one week after undergoing emergency surgery, according to the game show's latest Instagram post.</p>
      <p>Sajak, who underwent a procedure to correct a blocked intestine, added in a statement that his recovery is expected to be "complete and relatively fast."</p>
      <p>Until then, Vanna White has been hosting "Wheel of Fortune."</p>
      <p>"Getting back home has given me the time to reflect on—and appreciate—the love and support of my family, friends, co-workers, casual acquaintances and countless Wheel Watchers," Sajak stated. "For better or worse, doctors tell me they did not remove my sense of humor. See you all soon."</p>
      <p>Sajak, 73, and White, 62, have been at the helm of the syndicated game show for more than 30 years. Earlier in the week, after Sajak joked that White may have "completely taken over" in his absence, she assured him that his job is "safe... well, pretty safe."</p>
      <p>"Wheel of Fortune without @patsajak is like a word without vowels. I’ll fill in the blanks until you return," she tweeted. "Rest up and we’ll be solving puzzles in no time."</p>
