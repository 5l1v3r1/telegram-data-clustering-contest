      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The sickos are forcing volunteers to quit due to their disgusting behaviour and often make up stories about child abuse to play-out a 'fantasy'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:09:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:09</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Sharp</a></address>
      <p>Pervert phone callers are forcing volunteers to quit their life-saving roles at the Samaritans.</p>
      <p>The mostly male sickos target female helpers to listen to their voices while performing sex acts.</p>
      <p>They tell false stories of abuse but volunteers hang up when it is obvious what is happening.</p>
      <p>One worker explained: “They say things like, ‘I’ve done something terrible’ and start reeling out a situation where they’ve touched a child.</p>
      <p>"You want to believe people are seeking help but you realise it’s just a fantasy they’re playing out.</p>
      <p>“Some threaten to harm a child if they can’t play it out.</p>
      <p>“I’m wise to it now but new ­volunteers can get very upset."</p>

      <p>The adviser said the number of sex pests increases over Christmas as more people call.</p>
      <p>The source added: “I was ­working last Boxing Day and ­received 20 calls. Nineteen were from men and most were sex calls.”</p>
      <p>Another Samaritan told an online discussion how they quit when the abusive calls became too much.</p>

      <p>The ex-volunteer said: “I left because the sex calls were ­outweighing the calls from those who needed help.</p>
      <p>"I also started to feel used by those men who phoned in the early hours to discuss which lipstick or foundation to wear.”</p>
      <p>The Samaritans denied the ­volume of nuisance calls was that high.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “Misuse does happen and is frustrating as volunteers’ time is better spent ­supporting those in need.</p>
      <p>“All Samaritans volunteers undertake training and are given support.”</p>
