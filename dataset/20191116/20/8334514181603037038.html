      <p>Only the most one-eyed Federer followers could not have been impressed with the Greek’s 6-3 6-4 victory, achieved with the kind of tennis they are used to seeing from their idol.</p>
      <p>With his fearless, eye-pleasing groundstrokes, regular forays to the net and booming serves, the engaging 21-year-old certainly has much to applaud. But he knows the Federer followers will be tough to win over.</p>
      <p>“I hope they like me when I play out on the court, because I feel like I have a lot of things to offer for tennis,” Tsitsipas said.</p>
      <p>“And I would love to see one day potentially a fan base and people come to the court like they do for Roger, because it’s an army. And you need that. You need an army like this.</p>
      <p>“I want to feel connected with people. I want to be known as a good tennis player because that’s what the fans want to see. They want to see a good personality.”</p>
      <p>The way Tsitsipas responded when put under intense pressure on Saturday was impressive. He saved 11 of the 12 break points he faced and survived an epic 13-minute game when he served for the first set at 5-3, sealing it at the seventh time of asking.</p>
      <p>Worryingly for the fellow young guns who will surely be vying for major glory with Tsitsipas, he appears to thrive on adversity and relish a fight, as he showed when losing to ultimate warrior Rafael Nadal in a three-hour match he didn’t even need to win on Friday.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really see it as a pressure,” Tsitsipas said when asked about saving so many crucial points against Federer.</p>
      <p>“I mostly see it as a challenge for me. He’s up a breakpoint, I see that as a challenge to overcome the difficulty. It’s like you’re basically — you know it’s going to be difficult. I have managed to turn that into a challenge and try to be as aggressive as possible.”</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas will face Austrian Dominic Thiem or defending champion Alexander Zverev in the final.</p>
