      <p>Princess Nokia has dropped off her newest track, "Balenciaga," offering a lyrical argument against social media's ills. On the track, Nika makes a case against dressing for "likes," and promotes the act of dressing for oneself. She even takes things a step further by literally shedding off layers of designer in an accompanying NSFW clip.</p>
      <p>“This song is about the fun I’ve always had taking designer concepts and recreating them with imagination and personality,” Nokia revelaed in a statement. “It’s about weird, off-kilter fashion and the blurred lines between fashion and style. It’s not anti-designer at all…it’s just a song about practicality and comfortability with one’s self. It’s about non-conformity and not taking fashion too seriously. The underlying theme I realized was about not caring what people think and dressing for yourself.”</p>

      <p>Sketchers lookin' like Balenciaga<br/>Thrift clothes lookin' like the Prada<br/>Whole fit lit, it cost me nada<br/>Bitches always talkin', I give them all nada</p>
