      <p>Huawei will get two weeks license extension to do business with US companies<br/>5 (100%) 4 votes</p>
      <p>Last May, it was learned that the US administration had added the Huawei group to its Entity List, a group of companies and institutions with which American companies were no longer allowed to do business. Since then, however, Washington has announced that some companies could ask for exemptions. While the deadline for these exceptional license applications was November 19, it should be extended by two weeks.</p>
      <p>The information comes directly from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech/u-s-to-extend-license-allowing-its-cos-to-continue-business-with-huawei-nyt-idUSKBN1XQ024?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">Reuters</a> in an article published this Saturday, but also the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/business/us-reprieve-huawei.html">New York Times</a>. According to the news agency, “the announcement of the extension will be on Monday. When the previous deadline will expire”. The idea behind this extension will be to allow some operators in rural areas of the United States to have the time to make their demands and minimize the impact of the embargo on these companies.</p>

      <p>On Friday, the US Secretary of Commerce announced on Fox Business Network that many of these rural-oriented operators needed temporary licenses to continue using <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Huawei">Huawei</a> technologies for their 3G and 4G networks. For his part, the US General Attorney said he has concerns about the Chinese group and says he does not trust them because of its history.</p>
      <p>It would not be the first time Washington has extended the deadline for applying for licenses. Indeed, the deadline was originally set for August 19 before being extended by 90 days. On the other hand, if Washington has started to look at the files of the different companies. That want to continue to do business with Huawei. We do not know which ones will benefit from these licenses. If Google is part of it, it would allow the Chinese manufacturer to get out of a very complicated situation. Since it can not for the moment integrate Google’s apps and services in its latest devices.</p>
