      <h3>Bill Maher Blasts ‘Creepy Wrestling Coach’ Jim Jordan For Alleged Role In Sexual Abuse Scandal</h3>
      <p>

      <p><i>Real Time</i> host <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/bill-maher/">Bill Maher</a> used his opening monologue on Friday’s show to blast Ohio Representative Jim Jordan for allegations that he did nothing about now-deceased physician Richard Strauss and his reported sexual abuse of young boys while he was the Ohio State University (OSU) wrestling team’s physician.</p>
      <p>“Jim Jordan, he’s a former wrestling coach, who the players say knew that the team doctor was sexually abusing a lot of the players — and he did nothing about it,” Maher said, per <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/jim-jordan-dennis-hastert-ohio-state-alleged-sexual-abuse-bill-maher-1472204?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NewsweekTwitter&amp;utm_medium=Social"><i>Newsweek</i></a>. “Now to be fair to Jim Jordan, he is not accused of abusing any of the players himself, he just stood by and did nothing while horrible things happened: so good practice for the hearing.”</p>
      <p>Maher compared the accusations to the 2016 conviction of former Yorkville, Illinois wrestling coach Dennis Hastert, who was convicted in 2016 of trying to pay off boys he later admitted to sexually abusing.</p>
      <blockquote>“Jim Jordan is the second wrestling coach turned Republican congressman who has had a sex scandal having to do with the wrestling children. Dennis Hastert anybody?…He was also a creepy wrestling coach. What are the odds?”</blockquote>
      <p>According to a federal lawsuit involving hundreds of plaintiffs claims, OSU officials — including Jordan — <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5735092/jim-jordan-ohio-state-abuse/">turned a blind eye</a> to Strauss’ sexual abuse, which reportedly led to at least 177 instances of sexual assault.</p>

      <p>Per <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-republicans-jim-jordan"><i>The Guardian</i></a>, Jordan has taken on the role of “attack dog” in the impeachment probe into Donald Trump. The president is accused of pressuring Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden, and Jordan has taken it on himself to block, deflect, and argue against evidence in favor of Trump’s impeachment.</p>
      <p>Jordan’s role in the inquiry was reportedly a last-minute decision by Representative Kevin McCarthy, and he was placed on the intelligence panel so he could play a prominent role in public questioning, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/jim-jordan-impeachment-hearings.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a> reports. The former state legislator rarely wears a suit jacket and did not wear one Wednesday during questioning of Bill Taylor, which Robin Givhan, the fashion critic for <i>The Washington Post</i>, claims was a power move.</p>
      <p>As suggested by political commentator and former senior adviser for the House oversight committee Kurt Bardella via the aforementioned article from <i>The Guardian</i>, Jordan’s role as Trump’s defender is a change from his previous approach to politics. Bardella claims that the 55-year-old co-founder of the Freedom Caucus used to defend oversight, congressional authority, and whistleblower protections — but no longer does so.</p>
