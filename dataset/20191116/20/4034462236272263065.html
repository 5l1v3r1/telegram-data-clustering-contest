      <h1>Chevy Camaro Designer Believes Sedans Will Become Popular Again</h1>
      <h2>The SUV can't be dominant forever.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:50:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Wright</a></address>
      <p>We have our own pet theory on the subject of crossovers and SUVs dominating the industry right now. Back in the 1970s, the station wagon was incredibly popular. That popularity disappeared as the kids that grew up in the back of them grew up and then didn't want to drive the same car as their parents. A better example of that is the minivan, which sprung up in the 1980s and was a huge part of the landscape of America well into the 1990s. Now, the vast majority of kids that grew up in the back of them will do <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chrysler-suffers-because-people-don-t-want-minivans">anything but drive an uncool minivan now</a> they are in the middle of adulthood. The consistent vehicle through all the trends and cycles has been the sedan, and we believe it will be prominent in the industry again.</p>

      <p>That's just a theory <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/nissan-is-relying-on-this-age-group-to-revive-the-sedan">backed by a little research for now</a>, but GM design chief, Michael Simcoe, also believes the sedan will make a comeback. <a href="http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/11/gm-design-chief-believes-industry-will-shift-back-to-sedans/">GM Authority</a> spotted that in an interview on the podcast <a href="https://www.brembo.com/en/company/podcast">Brembo Red</a> with Brembo boss Dan Sandberg and GM design chief Michael Simcoe who spelled out his reasoning on why he believes the industry will cycle back to sedans. He acknowledges that SUVs are king right now and took the hatchback and sedan's place, "But I think there will be a cycle [round to sedans again] in the industry. And again, then we go back to electrification, which will make people think differently."</p>

      <p>The position of the sedan has caused some splits in the industry. Nissan, for example, has stoically stood by the car, and Honda and Toyota still see strong sales of the Civic and Corolla. On the flip side, we have also just learned that Ford's and Chevy's hasty exit from the sedan market in America has cost them. Rather than customers moving from the Focus and Cruze into the brand's SUVs, they've gone to another brand for a car.</p>
      <p>There's also a fashion element, and Simcoe points out that people "... want to park something in their driveway that their neighbors admire." Right now, the way to stand out is to not buy yet another SUV, but a nice looking sedan or a wagon instead.</p>
