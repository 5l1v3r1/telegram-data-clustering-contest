      <h2>Blue and White leader asks leaders of right-religious bloc to 'free' Likud from obligations to the bloc.</h2>

      <p>Prior to the expiry of Blue and White MK Benny Gantz's time to form a government, the Blue and White negotiating team will meet Sunday with those of the Labor party and Yisrael Beytenu.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, <i>Kan 11</i> reported that Blue and White is losing faith in the option of a unity government, and said they do not believe in Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. The Blue and White party has examined <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/269442">the President's Compromise</a>, but they claim to fear Netanyahu will use his immunity to prevent himself from being convicted, garnering a majority thanks to the Yisrael Beytenu party.</p>
      <p>Turning to the leaders of <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/269102">the 55-MK right-religious bloc</a>, Gantz said: "You're all responsible people - are you really prepared to let Netanyahu drag Israel to a third round of elections? Is that what your voters want? Is that what the patients in the hospitals' hallways deserve?"</p>
      <p>"Can we leave Israel's security challenges without experienced, constant, and stable hands on the steering wheel? Free Netanyahu of his obligation to the bloc and allow him to hold direct negotiations."</p>
      <p>The Likud party responded: "The Likud requests [Blue and White MK] Yair Lapid free Benny Gantz of his obligation to the bloc."</p>
