      <p><b>UPDATE (November 16, 2019): </b><a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/11/15/iron-man-tony-stark-mcu-return-disney-what-if-series/">Comicbook.com</a> has revealed that Robert Downey Jr. will return as Iron Man in animated form for the new <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/marvel-studios-what-if-disney-plus-series-explained"><i>What If…?</i></a> series on Disney+. The news was confirmed by Jeff Goldblum in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve0A_dZMh74&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=675">interview</a> with Buzzfeed where he mentioned that he recorded the Grandmaster’s voice for an upcoming episode, alongside Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Korg (Taika Waititi).</p>
      <p><b>Original Story:</b> According to reports, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/robert-downey-jr">Robert Downey Jr.</a> is currently in discussions to reprise his role as Tony Stark/<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/iron-man">Iron Man</a> for a potential <i>Ironheart</i> series for <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/disney-plus">Disney+</a>. <i>Ironheart</i> would showcase <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/marvel-comics">Marvel Comics</a> character Riri Williams take up the mantle for Stark as the newest Iron-based superhero.</p>
      <p>Similar to the comics, Downey Jr. expected to return as a voiceover for her suit’s AI like Paul Bettany’s J.A.R.V.I.S. before him. Unlike the comics, Williams takes up the mantle for a coma-induced Stark rather than as a result of his death, as seen in this summer’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/avengers-endgame"><i>Avengers Endgame</i></a>. Although, since <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/spider-man-far-from-home"><i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i></a> showcased a world mourning his loss and a need for another hero like Spidey to take his place, this may be the logical next step in that regard.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/marvel-studios">Marvel Studios</a> currently has made no comments on the news, Downey Jr. commented that <i>Ironheart</i> should be part of the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/marvel-cinematic-universe">MCU</a> after her comic book writer Eve Ewing brought him up on stage at the Film Center Gala this year.</p>
      <p>In other Marvel news, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/spider-man-far-from-home-digital-blu-ray-release-details"><i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>‘s digital &amp; Blu-Ray release will feature a new short film</a>.</p>
