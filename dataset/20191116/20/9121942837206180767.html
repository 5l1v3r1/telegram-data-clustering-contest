      <p>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Joe Burrow threw for a career-best 489 yards and five touchdowns as No. 1 LSU built a big lead and held off Mississippi 58-37 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Coming off an emotional 46-41 home win at Alabama last week, the Tigers (10-0, 6-0 Southeastern Conference) scored on four of their first five possessions jump out to a 28-0 lead over the Rebels (4-7, 2-5).</p>
      <p>The teams combined for 1,328 yards of total offense, including 714 by the Tigers. Burrow enhanced his Heisman Trophy front-runner status, completing 32 of 42 passes, including touchdown passes of 34, 51 and 61 yards to Ja’Marr Chase (227 yards) and 12 and 7 yards to Justin Jefferson (112 yards).</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t pretty, but we did it after a big win last week,” LSU coach Ed Orgeron said. “We came in here to win a football game and we won by 21 points. We’re 10-0 and I’m very proud of that.”</p>
      <p>Burrow completed 17 consecutive passes at one point to set a school record and passed Rohan Davey’s single-season school record for yards passing set in 2001. He threw two interceptions in the second half as Ole Miss climbed closer, but put the game away with a 61-yard touchdown pass to Chase with 5:11 remaining.</p>
      <p>Chase tied the school record with his 12th touchdown catch of the season.</p>

      <p>“I thought he (Burrow) was on fire, especially in the first half,” Orgeron said. “He made a lot of plays and extended some plays with his feet. He’s a great athlete.”</p>
      <p>Clyde Edwards-Helaire capped the scoring with a 49-yard touchdown run with 3:08 left and finished with 174 yards rushing on 23 carries.</p>
      <p>“We dug ourselves too deep a hole,” Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said. “We had a chance to get it to a one possession game, but we never could get there.”</p>
      <p>Ole Miss freshman quarterback John Rhys Plumlee had 212 yards rushing yards, a school record for a quarterbacks, and three touchdowns and was 9 of 16 passing for 123 yards.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t stop him but we won the football game,” Orgeron said. “(Burrow) broke a record and so did Ja’Marr. We’re going to get better. I have to remind them (team) to enjoy the win.”</p>
      <p>Reserve quarterback Matt Corral connected with Elijah Moore on a 55-yard touchdown pass in the final period.</p>

      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>LSU: The Tigers set the tone with the early touchdown barrage and eliminated the thought of a road upset.</p>
      <p>Ole Miss: The Rebels got big runs from Plumlee and Jerrion Ealy (13 carries for 141 yards), but were 2 of 11 on third down conversions and 1 of 4 on fourth down conversions. The Rebels pulled within 11 points midway through the third quarter, but never got any closer.</p>
      <p>POLL IMPLICATIONS</p>
      <p>LSU’s impressive first half performance should be enough to remain No. 1 in next week’s poll.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>LSU: Hosts Arkansas in the first of a season-ending, two-game home stand on Saturday. The Tigers can clinch the SEC West with a victory.</p>
      <p>Ole Miss: Visits Mississippi State for the in-state rivalry Egg Bowl on Nov. 28.</p>
