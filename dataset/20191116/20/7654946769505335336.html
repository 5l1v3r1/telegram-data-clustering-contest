      <p>Police arrested five people, including the alleged gunman, in connection with a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/2-wounded-when-gunman-opens-fire-at-packed-nj-high-school-football-game/">shooting at a crowded New Jersey high school football game</a> — violence triggered by “petty vengeance,” officials said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Alvin Wyatt, 31, of Atlantic City was charged with 3 counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, Atlantic County Prosecutor <a href="https://www.acpo.org/5-men-apprehended-charged-in-connection-to-shooting-at-pleasantville-football-game/?fbclid=IwAR2qpR3ZV2Fe8VBwYmgNzrJ3cggZ84BaOwNSV2xMLrTjEFMDWED34i7bTD4">Damon G. Tyner announced</a>.</p>
      <p>The four other men, all in their 20’s, were charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and certain persons not to possess a weapon.</p>
      <p>Three people were wounded when the shooter opened fire into a crowd of spectators sitting on the bleachers at Pleasantville High School at about 8:30 p.m. Friday, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The spray of bullets struck a 10-year-old boy, who remained in critical condition Saturday, officials said.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old male was also shot, and a 15-year-old boy suffered a graze wound and was later released, police said.</p>
      <p>After the shootings, the men fled — one of them tossing a gun out the car window as they approached Atlantic City, the prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>“Unlike some of the shootings that have occurred on school premises throughout the country, this incident had nothing to do with the students of Pleasantville High School or Camden High School,” Tyner said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The venue simply presented an opportunity for criminals to pursue their own form of petty vengeance against one another.  As a result, an innocent child was caught and injured in their crossfire,” Atlantic County Prosecutor Damon G. Tyner said.</p>
      <p>The revenge-shooting unfolded while the Pleasantville Greyhounds were playing the Camden Panthers in front of a packed stadium, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Video posted online shows terrified fans and players sprinting for cover after the shots rang out.</p>
      <p>New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy called the shooting a “despicable attack.”</p>
      <p>“Grateful for our first responders. Our prayers are with the victims for a full recovery,” <a href="https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1195739196520116225">he said in a tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>The names of the injured victims have not been released.</p>
