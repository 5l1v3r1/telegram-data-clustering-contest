      <p>Nov. 16 (UPI) -- A Utah company has recalled 2-pound bags of frozen Quest cat food nationwide over potential salmonella contamination.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/go-raw-llc-recalls-one-lot-quest-beef-because-possible-salmonella-health-risk">company announcement said</a> this week that salmonella, which may cause nausea and fever symptoms, could affect not only animals, but also humans handling products if they do not wash their hands thoroughly afterwards.</p>
      <p>No illnesses have been reported.</p>
      <p>Go Raw, LLC, of Cottonwood, Utah, is conducting the voluntary recall of one lot of beef type Quest cat food.</p>
      <p>It was initiated after the Minnesota Department of Agriculture notified the firm that a sample was collected and tested positive for salmonella.</p>
      <p>"The firm did conduct their own test which resulted in a negative result," the announcement said. "Salmonella is not evenly distributed throughout a lot which is why it could have been found on a small sample that the Minnesota department of agriculture took."</p>
      <p>The items were distributed nationwide and identified with UPC-6-91730-17101-8, Lot N128, the announcement said. Customers who have purchased the items are encouraged to return them to retail stores where they bought the products for a full refund.</p>
