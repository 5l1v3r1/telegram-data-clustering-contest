      <h1>Places in America which share their names with ones in Burton and South Derbyshire</h1>
      <h2>There's plenty of Burtons and even a Linton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Kreft</a></address>
      <p>It is well documented that many American towns and cities have taken the names of many of their counterparts in England since its discovery in 1492.</p>
      <p>The country boasts New York which even has a Manchester and a Worcester.</p>
      <p>York and Lancaster are near Philadelphia, while Ohio is home to Cambridge.</p>
      <p>The list is endless but did you know we have a few namesakes across the pond that have their origins this side of the Atlantic?</p>
      <p>As there are many places in the US that share their names with many towns and villages in the Burton and South Derbyshire area.</p>
      <p>This is by no means an an exhaustive list so if you know any more email <a href="http://helen.kreft@reachplc.com/">helen.kreft@reachplc.com</a></p>
      <p>Starting with Burton, there are a total of 14 Burtons across America.</p>

      <h3>Places in America which share their names with ones here</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Burton</h4>
          <figure>

          </figure>
          <p>The states in America which are home to a Burton are Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>
          <p>Fun fact that the town of Burton, in Georgia is now underwater, covered by Lake Burton. It was established in the 19th century due to the gold rush and was named after the postmaster Jeremiah Burton.</p>
          <p>The dam for Lake Burton was closed on December 22, 1919, and before long the town was submerged.</p>
          <p>All fine places for sure, but there's only one Burton brewing capital of the world and it's here in East Staffordshire.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Hatton in the US is actually a city in Traill County, North Dakota. It was founded in 1882 and named after Frank Hatton the assistant postmaster general. In 2010 it had a population of just 777.</p>
          <p>We're wondering if this place is home to a coffee factory or has a cafe that can rival the Salt Box.</p>

          <h4>Sudbury</h4>

          </figure>
          <p>Sudbury is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. In 2010 it had a population of 17,659. The original town centre and meeting house were located near the Sudbury River at what is now known as Wayland's North Cemetery.</p>
          <p>In August 1925, a Sudbury farm was the scene of a riot between local members of the Ku Klux Klan and Irish-American youths from the area. Five people were wounded by gunshots.</p>
          <p>An interesting history to this place for sure, but our Sudbury in Derbyshire has some history of its own in Sudbury Hall and the Museum of Childhood.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Willington is a town in Tolland County, Connecticut, with a population was 6,041 at the 2010 census. In 1720 a party of eight men, originally from England, bought 16,000 acres of the region and called it Wellington. Willington was incorporated in May 1727.</p>
          <p>It also appears in McCormick County, South Carolina. The population was 177 at the 2000 census.</p>
          <p>We wondering if they have a pub to rival The Dragon and a picturesque marina.</p>

          <p>Repton is a town in Conecuh County, Alabama. It was incorporated on January 10, 1899. At the 2010 census the population was just 282. There is not much available online but it does have a little Town of Repton website.</p>
          <p>But there's only one Repton that is the capital of Mercia and it's right here in South Derbyshire. We're also wondering if they have a school that can boast famous old boys like our Repton School, which was attended by children's author Roald Dahl and former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson?</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Hartshorne is a city in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, and is the second largest city in the county. The population was 2,125 at the 2010 census.</p>
          <p>The community was named for Dr Charles Hartshorne, a wealthy investor from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was attracted by the potential profits offered by coal deposits in the area.</p>
          <p>Our Hartshorne, of course, can boast some famous sons. Heavyweight boxing legend Jack Bodell once lived in our Hartshorne, as did Olympic cycling hero George Newberry. He won a bronze medal at the 1952 Helsinki games.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Walton is a city in Kentucky with a population of 3,635 at the 2010 census. It was established in 1840.</p>
          <p>Odd fact is Walton had a dog as a mayor, Jiminia, a Great Dane, who took office in the great political revolution of 1901.</p>
          <p>Not sure we can top a dog being mayor here, but do they have a Bailey Bridge?</p>

          <h4>Linton</h4>

          </figure>
          <p>Linton is featured at least twice in America, the first as a city in Stockton Township, Green County, Indiana, with a population of 5,413.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, it is also a city in Emmons County, North Dakota, with a population of 1,097. The city serves as a governmental, commercial and business hub for Emmons County.</p>
          <p>All sounds great but can they boast any fooballing aces. Rodney Fern, Vic Halom and Jeff Bourne all went to Linton Primary School. They were even all in the same class together. Fern played for Leicester City, Halom played for Fulam and Luton and even managed Burton Albion. Bourne played for Derby County and Burton Albion.</p>
