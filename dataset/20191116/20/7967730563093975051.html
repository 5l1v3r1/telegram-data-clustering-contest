      <p>England coach Eddie Jones' spell at the helm of the Barbarians was an unsuccessful one as his team lost 33-31 to Fiji at Twickenham.</p>
      <p>Mathieu Bastareaud and Andre Esterhuizen provided early tries for the Baa-Baas, but Fiji claimed a first-half lead with Enele Malele and Teti Tela both adding converted tries to the scoreboard.</p>

      <p>John Dyer protected that dominance when opening the second half with a try that was duly converted by Tela.</p>
      <p>The Barbarians responded with an effort from Makazole Mapimpi, but Curwin Bosch's conversion fell short.</p>
      <p>Fiji then hit back as Asaeli Tikoirotuma fed the ball to Temo Mayanavanua, who consequently claimed a try that was again converted by Tela.</p>

      <p>The Baa-Baas' attempts to draw level were then stunted as two quick-fire efforts were both disallowed.</p>
      <p>Tendai Mtawarira saw his effort voided after replays showed that the ball had slipped from his hands as he crossed the line.</p>

      <p>Esterhuizen's attempt at a second try was also scrubbed off as he was deemed to have been just short of the line upon closer inspection.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was Fiji who tightened their grasp on the game when Dyer struck again and the conversation was deftly handled by Tela.</p>

      <p>The Barbarians mounted a late comeback, with Mapimpi crossing in the 77th minute and Morne Steyn matching his effort with a try immediately afterwards.</p>
      <p>Steyn kicked the conversion himself after three missed attempts from five-eighth Bosch, but the points gained were not enough to close the gap and Fiji were triumphant, claiming the Killik Cup.</p>
