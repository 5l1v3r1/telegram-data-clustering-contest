      <h1>Video: ESPN Analysts Debate Nick Saban’s Tua Tagovailoa Decision</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:19:40+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Typically, most teams would be thrilled to be beating a conference opponent 38-7. Unfortunately for Alabama, the main storyline from this game is the <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/injury-update-for-alabama-qb-tua-tagovailoa-vs-mississippi-state">brutal injury</a> suffered by Tua Tagovailoa, when things already seemed well in hand for Nick Saban’s team.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, who has been dealing with an ankle injury that kept him out of the game against Arkansas a few weeks ago, remained in the game up 35-7, to attempt a three-minute drill at the end of the half.</p>
      <p>Some coaches would have pulled their banged up Heisman candidate quarterback  by that point. Saban wanted to <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/why-tua-tagovailoa-still-playing-mississippi-state">get him that valuable end of half drill experience</a>, which you can’t always replicate in a true game situation.</p>
      <p>On a pass attempt, Tua rolled left, and came down awkwardly after being hit by two Bulldog defenders. The new injury is reportedly a hip issue, and the quarterback was heard “<a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/injury-update-for-alabama-qb-tua-tagovailoa-vs-mississippi-state">screaming in pain</a>” as he was taken off the field.</p>

      <p>Saban, who is usually above reproach, <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/nick-saban-catching-heat-for-keeping-tua-tagovailoa-in-too-long">has taken serious heat</a> for the decision. After the injury, ESPN’s Jesse Palmer and Joey Galloway debated his decision.</p>
      <p>Palmer says that Saban should have pulled him before that final drive, with the game well in hand.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think so, but I think Nick Saban should’ve stuck with his instinct and taken Tua out of the game at the end of the half, when they’re up 35-7. At that point, the game’s in hand. Mississippi State only has 83 total yards of offense at this point.<br/><br/>“Now, it’s a tough situation, because it did look like his star player Tua went over and spoke to him, wanted to stay in for a two minute drill. But you gotta remember, Tua was a game-time decision to begin with, so it was a blessing at this point with three minutes ago in the first half that Tua was still doing okay, still looked healthy enough.<br/><br/>“I think at this point if you’re Nick Saban, you need this guy to make the Playoff. He should’ve taken Tua out of the game.”</blockquote>
      <p>Galloway was a bit more understanding, and stood by the notion that if Tua was healthy enough to start the game at all, he believes Saban was justified in leaving him in to get that valuable experience.</p>
      <blockquote>“I do understand letting your quarterback stay in for a two-minute situation, because you try to practice those, but there is nothing you can practice that is similar to a two-minute situation with your quarterback.<br/><br/>“Of course, he’s having a great half, you’re winning the game, but those are moments in games where coaches say ‘this is rare opportunity, to let my quarterback operate in the two minute.'”</blockquote>
      <p>I expect most will side with Palmer here, but either way, we’re all hoping that the situation isn’t as bad as it appears. Tua Tagovailoa is a joy to watch, and seeing Alabama try and battle its way into the playoff with him there would be very entertaining.</p>
