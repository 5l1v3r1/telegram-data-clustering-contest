      <h1>Jim Harbaugh Didn’t Hold Back Late vs. Michigan State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:59:20+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>We all know about the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry, and how the current losing streak has weighed on the program. There is no love lost with in-state rival Michigan State either.</p>
      <p>Michigan State has had UM’s number for much of the last decade. Last season, the Wolverines <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/devin-bush-reveals-why-he-tore-up-michigan-state-logo">won a chippy game</a>, 21-7.</p>
      <p>MSU has struggled this season, without a win since September. That continued today, and Jim Harbaugh was happy to rub it in.</p>
      <p>Late in the game, Michigan kept throwing, putting up a touchdown on a 39-yard Shea Patterson pass to Cornelius Johnson to make it 44-10.</p>
      <p>He finished with 384 yards and four touchdowns, a record performance for a Wolverines quarterback vs. Michigan State.</p>

      <p>Given what happened to Tua Tagovailoa in admittedly early garbage time for Alabama at Mississippi State, coaches may want to be a bit more careful with leaving important players in unnecessary situations, but it worked out for Michigan against the Spartans.</p>
      <p>After the disappointing start to the year, Michigan has now blown out rivals Notre Dame and Michigan State, putting up over 40 points in each game. The offense struggled to get going early on, but has figured something out.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is a huge jump up for the Spartans or even the Fighting Irish. UM should feel good about these last few weekends, but the Buckeyes look like they’re at a different level than most of the country at this point.</p>
