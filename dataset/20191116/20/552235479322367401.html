      <h1>Raging Cyprus boss slaughters referee as he vents his spleen over Scotland's 'long ball' merchants</h1>
      <h2>The manager was furious at ref Harald Lechner for failing to spot an early strike that looked to have crossed the line</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:43:17+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Seething Cyprus coach Ran Ben Shimon slammed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> as long ball merchants who didn’t deserve to nick a win in Nicosia.</p>
      <p>The manager was furious at ref Harald Lechner for failing to spot an early strike that looked to have crossed the line. But Shimon also took a pop at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> ’s men as he insisted his side were the only team trying to play football.</p>
      <p>He said: “The ball was in the corner for six minutes in the latter stages. We had prepared for long balls, but not that amount of long balls. I have respect for opponents but the better team lost.</p>
      <p>“It was a close match and could have gone either way. The team that tried to play football lost this game.”</p>

      <p>Shimon saved rage for the ref though and he believed the phantom goal played a major part in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> defeat.</p>
      <p>He said: “I never speak about referees but it was a poor performance.</p>
      <p>“It was the decisive moment in the game. To lead after six minutes would have been crucial. It was half a metre inside.</p>
      <p>“I am proud of my players, there were so many good things and we will continue on.”</p>
