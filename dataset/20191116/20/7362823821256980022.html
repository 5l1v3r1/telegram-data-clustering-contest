      <p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/the-real-housewives">The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>" star, 47, is raising kids -- Gia, 18, Gabriella, 15, Milania, 14, and Audriana, 10 -- while her husband, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joe-giudice-weight-loss-martial-arts">Joe Giudice</a>, has moved back to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joe-giudice-teresa-deportation-first-time-since-italy">native Italy</a> while awaiting a verdict in his deportation appeal.</p>
      <p>The family just returned from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/teresa-giudice-daughters-head-home-after-visiting-joe-italy">visiting him outside Naples</a>, and she admitted the experience was a mix of emotions.</p>

      <p>"You guys will see that play out. I can’t give a lot away, but I’m happy for him. I’m happy that he’s free. It was a very emotional trip. I cried a lot,” the reality TV star revealed during the "RHONJ" panel at BravoCon 2019 in New York City.</p>
      <p>“Milania was so happy that the six of us were together, eating together… He didn’t have to sit in ICE for 7 months, but he did. He fought. His daughters saw that he fought," she added.</p>

      <p>The bestselling author also spoke about how being the only parent in the country for her daughters is extremely stressful.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult. Joe and I were really strict with Gia. But then when the whole legal thing happened, I got a little soft because I was all by myself. Not that I spoiled them, but I tried to make up for the pain of Joe not being there,” she explained.</p>

      <p>“My girls had to grow up quick because of everything we’ve been through," Teresa continued.</p>
      <p>In particular, Milania really struggled -- “[Milania] saw a therapist last year. She had trouble in school. Now, she’s doing well in school. She lost over 40 pounds."</p>

      <p>“I thought the girls would be fine when we came back from Italy, but they’re really missing Joe still. I try to compensate. I jump over hoops for them because of everything that we’re going through. But they are amazing kids.”</p>
      <p>The Bravo cameras followed the family abroad and the footage will be featured soon.</p>
