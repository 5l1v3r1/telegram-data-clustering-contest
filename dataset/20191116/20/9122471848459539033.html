      <p>Kaepernick released a statement revealing the decision for the change. The NFL did not want media to attend and film the workout, so Kaepernick changed the location to allow media and the fans to see the workout for themselves.</p>
      <p>His girlfriend, Nessa Diab, released a statement about the move.</p>
      <p>“#Transparency We are ready!!! For teams and media wanting to attend today please contact his agent now,” she said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>According to NFL insider <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlesRobinson/status/1195787877633974273">Charles Robinson</a>, the decision to move the workout was Kaepernick’s.</p>
      <p>“Kaepernick wanting the public to see the workout and everything that happened with their own eyes,” he said. “When the NFL refused to allow that, plans were made to move it to an open venue where anyone/everyone could judge the quality of the workout.”</p>
      <p>The former star NFL quarterback will work out for team at 4:00 p.m. ET. Will a team sign him?</p>
