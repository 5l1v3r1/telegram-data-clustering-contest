      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">SHIV SENA</a> plans a show of strength on Sunday, the seventh death anniversary of party patriarch Balasaheb Thackeray.</p>
      <p>Sources said elaborate arrangements have been made for the large number of party leaders and workers who are likely to gather at Shivaji Park in Dadar to pay respects to the Sena patriarch. Balasaheb Thackeray had died on November 17, 2012 and was cremated at Shivaji Park.</p>
      <p>Maintaining that the gathering will be a kind of show of strength for the party, a Sena leader said: “We have made adequate arrangements for parking and separate entry for Sena leaders and workers. Also, following the Ram temple verdict and the party’s attempt to install its own chief minister may lead to more people joining the gathering from across the nation.”</p>
      <p>A leader said that with the party planning to form a government in the state with Congress and NCP, leaders from the two parties are also likely to pay their respects. “Balasaheb was leader beyond politics. Leaders from all political parties had come to pay their respects in the past,” said the leader.</p>
      <p>The party said an interview of Balasaheb Thackeray will be aired on Doordarshan on Sunday. “It was shot at Matoshree in 2002. It has been aired multiple times earlier and will be again aired tomorrow,” the leader said.</p>
