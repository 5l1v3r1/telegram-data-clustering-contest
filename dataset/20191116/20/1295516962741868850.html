      <p>When Marvel Comics kicked off its Dawn of X relaunch of the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men">X-Men</a> comics, it set up certain characters for all-new roles. The establishment of Krakoa as a mutant sovereign nation meant heroes and villains would now live together in perfect harmony. This meant villains like Apocalypse and Mister Sinister would go from sworn enemies to valued members of the X-Men's Quiet Council of leaders.</p>
      <p>Other changes came for X-Men members Betsy Braddock and Kitty Pryde. Prior to Jonathan Hickman taking control of the X-Men franchise, the mutant known as Psylocke finally resolved her identity issues, with Betsy and Kwannon being separated into their proper bodies. <i>Excalibur</i> #1 followed Betsy as she moved to Krakoa and teamed with her brother, Brian Braddock, to fight Morgan Le Fay in Otherworld. The sibling team-up concluded with Brian passing the Amulet of Right to Betsy, turning her into the new Captain Britain.</p>

      <p><i>Marauders</i> #1 introduced another new captain into the X-Men ranks as well. Finding herself unable to enter the Krakoan gateways, Kitty Pryde took up Emma Frost's offer to travel the black market with the X-Men's pharmaceutical drugs for the Hellfire Trading Company, along with smuggling mutants out of unfriendly nations. Kitty has previously gone by the codename Shadowcat, which relates to her mutant ability to phase her body through objects.</p>
      <p>However, once Kitty accepts her new responsibilities, she takes on the rank of Captain to become Captain Kate Pryde, leader of the Marauders. Two <i>X-Men</i> comics with female leaders isn't surprising, as <i>X-Men Gold</i>, <i>X-Men Blue</i> and <i>X-Men Red</i> had Kitty, time-displaced Jean Grey and current-day Jean Grey as their leaders. Now, a preview of <i>Excalibur</i> #2 pairs the new Captain Britain with Captain Kate Pryde for a sea-faring adventure.</p>

      <p>Captain Britain is hitching a ride with the Marauders to get to Lighthouse, which is the former base of operations for the original Excalibur team. Betsy and Kitty were teammates together on Excalibur, so this trip allows the two of them to catch up on old times. Of course, the reason for the team-up is a lot more serious than a mere reunion between old friends.</p>
      <p>Brian Braddock is still under Morgan Le Fay's control on Otherworld. Betsy plans on using the Lighthouse as a location to plant a Krakoan gateway. While the ladies catch up on old times, Gambit is more concerned with the status of his wife, Rogue, who was left in a catatonic state after touching a gateway infused with magical energy. Rogue using her powers on the gate is what allowed Betsy to escape back to Krakoa in the first place, though the plan was orchestrated by Apocalypse.</p>
      <p>All Gambit can focus on is helping Rogue, and he isn't in the mood for idle small talk. <a href="https://screenrant.com/xmen-theory-rogue-excalibur-secret-invader/">Whatever happened to Rogue</a>, she was left completely naked and wrapped in Krakoan plants while her body let off a light purple energy signature. Hopefully, the Excalibur team will start to get some answers when issue #2 goes on sale Nov. 20.</p>
