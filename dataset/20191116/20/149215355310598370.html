      <p>A new major federally funded study <a href="https://apnews.com/0962c6141ed2413cb329ff49faff30bf">released</a> Saturday at The American Heart Association's annual scientific conference found that stents and coronary bypass surgery are no more effective than drug treatment and better health habits in preventing heart attacks.</p>

      <p>Stents and surgery do, however, work better for relieving symptoms related to frequent chest pain, the study <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-limited-benefits-of-stent-use-for-millions-with-heart-disease-11573931727?mod=hp_lead_pos2">found</a>.</p>
      <p>The results of the study, while likely to increase debate between preventative and interventional cardiologists, do provide further evidence that caution is a-okay in many circumstances. "This shows the safety of not panicking when you see a positive stress test," <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-limited-benefits-of-stent-use-for-millions-with-heart-disease-11573931727?mod=hp_lead_pos2">said</a> Jay Giri, a practicing interventional cardiologist.
