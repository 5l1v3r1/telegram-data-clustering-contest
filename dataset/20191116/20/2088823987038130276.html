      <p>An Orchard Park man who was shot last December during an altercation in Ellicottville has filed a civil suit against the shooter and one of the local establishments.</p>
      <p>The attorney for Brandon Janesz filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court last week against Damien M. Marvin, the man charged and later acquitted in the shooting, as well as the Villaggio, an Ellicottville restaurant and bar on Monroe Street, where the altercation started.</p>
      <p>The civil suit alleges negligence on the part of the restaurant and claimed it continued to serve Marvin alcohol even after he was visibly intoxicated.</p>
      <p>Court papers also name Sixt Lumber, Marvinâ€™s employer at the time, which was holding a company Christmas party at the restaurant on the night of Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>The fight between Marvin and Janesz continued in the street, after both were thrown out of the bar, and ended with Janesz being shot in the abdomen.</p>
      <p>Marvin, who claimed he feared for his life, was charged with felony assault but was acquitted earlier this month after a three-day jury trial in Cattaraugus County Court, the Salamanca Observer reported.</p>
