      </p>
      <p>Playing furthest forward in black and white, Magpies attacker Kyle Wootton piled the pressure on when he could as a flustered Notts County lost 3-0 at Meadow Lane.</p>
      <p>Having started every game since September, the Scunthorpe United loanee had it all to do from early on, his side trailing from two quick goals as he attempted to penetrate a high Barrow defensive line.</p>
      <p>Seeing limited action in the opening 45 minutes in what promised to be a competitive fixture, Wootton spent more time in his own half than the opposition's for the most part, dropping back regularly to aid his struggling colleagues.</p>
      <p>Aware that the serial goal-scorer had found form already this campaign, Barrow defenders Connor Brown and Matt Platt stuck to the number 14 like glue in the second period.</p>
      <p>Proving to fans that he had “more to give” was looking a challenge.</p>
      <p>On six goals this season so far, the 23-year-old struggled as he pondered around the six-yard box with little to work on in the final third.</p>
      <p>A talented centre forward, the he looked frustrated with a lacklustre performance.</p>
      <p>Remaining at the heart of the action, Wootton knocked on Joel Dixon’s door when coming whiskers away from meeting and converting a beautiful cross from the right-hand side.</p>

      <p>Taking instructions regularly from Notts boss Neal Ardley, it became quickly apparent that any goals scored would be as a result of the man who netted twice in the FA Cup last week.</p>
      <p>Thus however, was not to be. Signalling for the ball and sneaking through cracks all the way through today’s encounter, vision from teammates was lacking massively – as did a goal scoring opportunities.</p>
      <p>Previously unbeaten at home since August, the hosts today were on the receiving end of a 3-0 defeat.</p>
      <p>In one of Wootton’s “favourite loan spells”, the result will not be a highlight in what has been a so far positive stint.</p>
