      <h1>'We went away to France in round two last year and got beaten by Toulouse' - Leinster boss wants to avoid another French pantsing</h1>

      <p>Leinster head coach Leo Cullen hailed his returning international contingent after their 33-19 bonus point victory over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton">Benetton</a> Rugby in their Heineken Champions Cup Pool One opener.</p>
      <p>Last season’s beaten finalists welcomed back a number of players who featured for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> at the World Cup, including hat-trick hero <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/garry-ringrose/">Garry Ringrose</a> and captain Jonathan Sexton, who also touched down and kicked three conversions.</p>
      <p>Cullen said: “That’s the pleasing piece – we’ve got more guys through games.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Continue reading below…<br/><a href="https://players.brightcove.net/5446914862001/Syefo5BfW_default/index.html?videoId=6104919354001">Click here to see the video</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>“Off the back of what a lot of guys have been through, trying to come back in, it’s like their season is starting again. In many ways, it’s round one for us as an entire squad.</p>
      <p>“We still have a couple of more guys that are still yet to appear. Overall we’re pleased. It wasn’t perfect, far from perfect, but it’s a win. We’ve got the job done in many respects.”</p>
      <p>Following Ringrose’s early brace young hooker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/ronan-kelleher/">Ronan Kelleher</a> marked his Champions Cup debut with a well-taken try as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster">Leinster</a> established a 19-7 half-time lead.</p>
      <p>But second-half scores from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/hame-faiva/">Hame Faiva</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/luca-sperandio/">Luca Sperandio</a>, adding to Dean Budd’s eighth-minute effort, showed the continuing improvements in Benetton’s game under Kieran Crowley.</p>

      <p>Although Leinster were always able to stay at least 12 points clear after the break, Cullen sounded a warning ahead of next weekend’s trip to Top 14 pacesetters Lyon.</p>
      <p>Having served up a first-round demolition to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps">Wasps</a> in last season’s tournament, they subsequently fell short against a rejuvenated <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse">Toulouse</a> just nine days later.</p>
      <p>The Leinster boss is eager to avoid a repeat performance in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> next Saturday, adding: “We went away to France in round two last year and got beaten by Toulouse. We go away to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/lyon">Lyon</a> this year and can we be better? That’s the question we’re asking ourselves.</p>
      <p>“The challenge is the fact that we’re not really up and running with this group yet. I think everyone thinks, ‘Okay, the group is going well’, but the PRO14, as we know, is very different to the challenge of Europe.”</p>
      <p>This game was a homecoming of sorts for Benetton fly-half Ian Keatley. A product of the Leinster academy, the Dublin native went on to represent <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht">Connacht</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> before making the switch to the Crowley-coached Treviso outfit.</p>
      <p>Keatley felt a lack of killer instinct played a part in his side’s downfall, saying: “European Cup nights in Ireland are something special, especially in (Munster’s) Thomond Park and (Leinster’s home) the RDS. It was a great atmosphere out there.</p>
      <p>“Kieran said we were coming with a positive attitude and that’s why we went for the corner early on and that gave us confidence when we scored.</p>
      <p>“If you give Leinster access to your 22 they are quite clinical, as they showed. We got into their 22 and we weren’t clinical. That was the difference.”</p>
