        <b>World champion Lewis Hamilton had to settle for third place in qualifying for the Brazilian Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen on pole</b>
      </p>
      <p>Max Verstappen produced an impressive qualifying performance to take only the second pole position of his Formula One career at the Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>The Red Bull driver finished 0.123 seconds ahead of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel in Saturday’s session at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton, who has already sealed the 2019 drivers’ title, came third, ending up 0.191s behind Verstappen in a Q3 session where the top drivers were closely matched.</p>
      <p>The Briton has vowed to be more aggressive now his sixth world championship is secured and has won this race in two of the last three years.</p>
      <p>Charles Leclerc was fourth but will drop down the grid due to a 10-place penalty he has collected due to taking a new power unit.</p>
      <p>That means Valtteri Bottas, who qualified fifth, will start alongside Hamilton in an all-Mercedes second row.</p>
      <p>Alexander Albon was sixth in the week he was confirmed as Verstappen’s team-mate for 2020 and will start on the third row with former Red Bull driver Pierre Gasly, who was the best of the rest outside of the top three teams.</p>

      <p>Haas sprung a surprise by getting both drivers into the top-10 shoot-out, with Romain Grosjean coming eighth and Kevin Magnussen 10th.</p>
      <p>Kimi Raikkonen was ninth for Alfa Romeo on the weekend he will equal Fernando Alonso on 312 F1 races, joint-second on a list led by Rubens Barrichello.</p>
      <p>It was a bad day for McLaren with Carlos Sainz unable to set a time in Q1 due to suffering a loss of power, while Lando Norris had to settle for 11th as he dropped out in Q2, though Leclerc’s penalty does mean he will start 10th.</p>
      <p>Both of those sessions were also topped by Verstappen, who led narrowly after the first runs of Q3 and then improved his time to make sure of pole.</p>

      <p>The Dutchman, who will now seek a second victory of the season, has never won a race from pole before but said: “Of course I’ll try to finish it off on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The car was flying and really enjoyable to drive straight from Q1. I’m really happy with this pole position.”</p>
