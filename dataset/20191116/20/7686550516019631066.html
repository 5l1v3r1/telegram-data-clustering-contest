      <p>Strictly's Anton made history on the show tonight after receiving his first ever 10 from the judges.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer received glowing praise across the board after his American smooth foxtrot with partner Emma Barton.</p>
      <p>Dancing to Frank Sinatra's Let's Face the Music and Dance, the couple certainly made an impression in Blackpool - bringing judges Bruno and Shirley to their feet.</p>
      <p>And to top it all off, he was awarded his very first 10 from the judges after 17 series, much to his fans' delight.</p>

      <p>Praising the pair, Motsi Mabuse said: "That dance was amazing, it was all about music.</p>
      <p>"You were a partner, that's what I love . When you guys dance together I felt so close to you guys.</p>
      <p>"I think that was the best you did best since you started Strictly."</p>
      <p>And Shirley added: "You covered everything there.</p>
      <p>"It was just beautifully executed, you had some lovely footwork there.</p>
      <p>"It was just lovely, I just felt it was your best dance by far."</p>
      <p>Despite facing criticism by Craig Revel Horwood about her expression, Eastenders star Emma and Anton received a perfect 10 from both Bruno and Shirley - causing Anon to kiss Emma before falling to his knees in amazement.</p>
      <p>And he wasn't the only one to react to the news.</p>
