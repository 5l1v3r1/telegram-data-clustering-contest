      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: British dad of two Kai Isaacs landed up in Bangkok's notorious International Detention Centre after overstaying his visa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T20:10:24+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Cardy, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/phil-cardy/</a></address>
      <p>A British dad jailed in Thailand for overstaying his visa has told of his horror after a fellow inmate died in his arms from a brutal beating.</p>
      <p>Kai Isaacs, 35, from the Isle of Wight, was locked up in a filthy room with 150 other inmates including gangsters and suspected terrorists in the notorious IDC, International Detention Centre, in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>Kai, a dad of two, told the Sunday People: “It was the worst three months of my life.</p>
      <p>"In the IDC there were 150 people in the room, sleeping on the floor 10 in a row.</p>
      <p>"It was hot, it stank, it was noisy, it was violent and scary.</p>
      <p>“There were people from 47 different countries.</p>
      <p>"There were suspected ­terrorists. Their own countries didn’t want them back so they had been there for years. They ran the place.</p>

      <p>“When this American lad, Rickey McDonald, came in they singled him out.</p>
      <p>"They didn’t like the USA much. He’d only been there for four days when he died.</p>
      <p>“They picked on him from the minute he walked in the room. They beat him and beat him and beat him.</p>
      <p>“He was bullied to the point he couldn’t get water. They gave you a three-litre bottle to fill up but the water was only on for an hour a day. If he stood up they hit him.</p>
      <p>“I ended up filling his bottle for him. There was one time I pushed them off when they attacked him.</p>
      <p>"A few of them grabbed me and I was kicked. But I was never beaten badly.</p>
      <p>“There was a bit more respect for me ­because I’d been in there for quite a long time, a lot longer than normal for Westerners.</p>
      <p>“But the guy died in my arms in the ­morning. It was suspected heart failure. It was horrible and I was still in there for weeks after it happened.”</p>

      <p>Now Kai has given a statement to the FBI, who are investigating the death of the Kentucky man on May 21.</p>
      <p>Kai’s nightmare began after he travelled to Thailand in August last year on a one-way flight to visit his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Before setting off he transferred £2,000 via MoneyGram to collect when he arrived. But when he tried to claim his cash he was told someone had already withdrawn it.</p>
      <p>He had a 30-day visa, as is standard for Brits travelling to Thailand, and had no money to book a flight home.</p>
      <p>Kai admits he made a mistake by going to stay with Thai friends for several months before contacting the British embassy for help in March this year.</p>

      <p>He said the embassy advised him to hand myself in at the Soi 9 police station in Pattaya, warning he would be arrested.</p>
      <p>Kai said they told him he would be transferred to the IDC but should be flown home to the UK within a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was kept in a cell with around 50 Thai ­people in a cage for five days then taken to court.”</p>
      <p>Kai was fined 4,500 baht – £115 – but couldn’t afford to pay. All his possessions, and what little money he had, went ­missing while he was in the police cell.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to nine days in Pattaya Nong Pla Lai jail where he spent his time in a room with around 150 Thai gangsters and murderers before being transferred to two police stations then going to the IDC.</p>
      <p>Kai said: “It’s an inhumane place. There are guards but there is a hierarchy among the inmates. The bosses were Iranian ­gangsters and regularly gave severe beatings. Every moment in there was horrific. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.”</p>
      <p>Kai was finally deported in June with the help of the embassy and has now been barred from returning to Thailand for five years.</p>
      <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “Our consular staff ­supported a British man detained in Thailand and remained in close contact with the Thai authorities.”</p>
