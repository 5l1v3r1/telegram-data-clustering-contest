      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA - Ibrahim Tanko, Coach of Ghana’s under 23 team, the Black Meteors has said, his tactical display against Mali in the last Group A match of the ongoing U-23 Africa Cup of Nations ( AFCON) worked to perfection.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors recorded a historic 2-0 win over Mali to ignite their hopes of winning this year's edition of the U- 23 Total AFCON and booking a place in the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, next year.</p>
      <p>Coach Tanko in a press conference after the game disclosed that the team's belief and strategic plan to introduce striker Kwabena Owusu ensured the win on the day.</p>
      <p>“I'm speechless because I think after the two games we didn't have a chance but I believed and told my team we only have to win today. The first half was really tough but in the second half my team showed character. We made good changes and Kwabena Owusu who is our main striker came from the bench to settle the difference."</p>
      <p>He dedicated the win to the whole team, congratulating the team for the memorable win.</p>
      <p>"I Congratulate my players, the whole team and the technical team for this victory"</p>
      <p>Ghana now has the opportunity to play in the semi-finals with Coach Tanko and his charges poised to pick an Olympic slot that has eluded Ghana for 15 years.</p>
      <p>"After the Egypt game I made them believe we still have a chance. And yesterday we had intensive training and our plans really worked on the day. For me, it's a collective win and I look forward to the next game," he said.</p>
      <p>Ghana will play the first placed team in Group B with only three teams to represent Africa in the Tokyo Olympic games, 2020.</p>
