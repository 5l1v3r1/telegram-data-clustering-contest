      <h1>Shocking figures show RSPCA had over 1,600 calls in the North East last Christmas</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sonia Sharma</a></address>
      <p>More than 1,600 calls were made to the RSPCA's cruelty line from the North East over the Christmas period last year, it has been revealed.</p>
      <p>The charity logged 695 incidents from Durham, 210 from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> and 708 from Tyne and Wear last December - a total of 1,613.</p>
      <p>Across the country, there were more than 61,000 calls that month, up by more than 5,000 the previous year.</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day itself, there were 934 calls nationally - the highest number for five years and almost a third more than in 2017.</p>
      <p>Among the incidents they attended in the North East was a female terrier found alone and freezing on New Year’s Day, wearing a tatty Christmas jumper.</p>
      <p>Ducky was discovered by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rspca">RSPCA</a> inspector Lucy Hoehne in the backyard of a property in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, after neighbours raised concerns.</p>
      <p>The pet was mostly bald due to untreated allergies.</p>
      <p>Insp Hoehne said: "I was unprepared for the heartbreaking sight that met me that day.</p>
      <p>"Poor Ducky was shaking and terrified alone in a garden at a time of year when so many pets are getting pampered and spoilt by loving families.</p>
      <p>"She'd been there since the early hours of the morning listening to the New Year fireworks going off and was in such a state."</p>

      <p>The pooch is now thriving after being nursed back to health by RSPCA staff and volunteers.</p>
      <p>Insp Hoehne added: "It's heartwarming to see how far she has come and although she will never fully recover due to the seriousness of her allergies, she can now live a happy life thanks to the dedication of the RSPCA branch who helped her and the fosterer who has taken care of her."</p>
      <p>The charity has now launched its festive Stock the Sleigh appeal to help thousands of abused, neglected, and abandoned <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/animals">animals </a>this Christmas.</p>
      <p>When most people will be tucking into their Christmas dinners, RSPCA inspectors will be working 24 hours a day rescuing animals, from pets to wildlife, and bringing them to safety.</p>
      <p>Some animals can spend weeks, months and sometimes years in their care, receiving the treatment and rehabilitation they need.</p>
      <p>Dermot Murphy, chief inspectorate officer, said: "Our cruelty line received more than 900 calls on Christmas Day last year and our rescue officers are always out working through the festive period to help animals in need.</p>
      <p>"Hospital staff will be working to provide veterinary care for injured and sick animals and our animal centre staff will be making sure the hundreds of pets and wild animals in our care over Christmas are well looked after.</p>
      <p>"Rescue work doesn’t stop just because it’s Christmas. We know that animals need our help all-year round and our officers are out in all weathers helping save pets from abuse and neglect, and rescuing wildlife who may be injured or in need of assistance.</p>
      <p>"We are expecting to take in more than 10,000 animals this winter which means the officers, vets and animal care staff are braced for another busy festive period.</p>
      <p>"We can’t do this on our own - we rely on our generous supporters to help the many animals who come into our care this Christmas in urgent need whether it is for veterinary care, medicine, food or a safe, comfortable and warm bed.</p>
      <p>"We are asking animal lovers to Stock the Sleigh for the RSPCA and help us to care for these animals in desperate need this winter."</p>
      <p>There were more than 5,000 animals taken in over the Christmas period last year, including more than 2,100 cats and more than 1,000 dogs, as well as hundreds of wildlife.</p>
      <p>It costs around £670,000 to run an RSPCA centre for a year.</p>
