      <h1>Greggs customer makes rather large order - and is not happy with staff response</h1>
      <h2>The customer ordered a 12 pack of doughnuts, before being asked by a woman behind the counter if he was intending to sit inside and eat them all in the shop</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:46:03+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">Kara O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>A man who made a rather large order at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/greggs">Greggs</a> has described the moment he was 'food-shamed' by a woman working behind the counter.</p>
      <p>The disgruntled customer took to social media to talk about the incident - although he didn't receive a whole lot of sympathy from those reading about his plight.</p>
      <p>@DazGaz_ wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "Just bought a box of 12 doughnuts from Greggs for my work and the bird asked if I'm sitting in or taking away."</p>
      <p>He followed his comment with two 'crying face' emojis.</p>
      <p>It's been retweeted 1,700 times - and has an incredible 37,200 likes.</p>
      <p>In the comments below, Tweeters tried to pick holes in Daz's story, writing: "Greggs don't do packs of 12 doughnuts. They do packs of 4 so I'm sorry to say but - that didn't happen."</p>
      <p>But other had Daz's back, posting a picture of a 12-piece doughnut platter that the shop advertises on its website to prove his order was legitimate.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Further down the threat, others were more concerned with the language Daz used.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "The bird? What as it? A parrot? A budgie? A wee sparra? C'moan pal. Show some respect. [sic]"</p>
      <p>Another added: "Bird? Are we back in the 90s?"</p>
      <p>People suggested that Daz should have told the Greggs staff member that he was going to sit inside with his doughnuts, describing it as the ultimate "power move".</p>
      <p>And several Twitter users suggested that all customers are asked that question, regardless of what they buy.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Is takeaway not cheaper as they must charge VAT to sit in? That way if they ask, at least they are covered if you then decide to eat in but on the takeaway price."</p>
      <p>It comes after a Greggs customer in Alton, Hants, felt she was shamed by one of the bakery shop's employees after he commented on how much she visits.</p>

      <p>Kathy Readon says the comment came after she ordered a pizza in her local branch, to which the server replied: "You're in here every day, you're going to get sick of this eventually."</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old failed to see the funny side of the employee's banter and added that, due to anxiety, the staff member's joke was like her "worst fears all happening all at once".</p>
      <p>Kathy, from Guildford, said: "Literally all that happened was I went in - I am a regular there, I work down the road and have been doing so for a year.</p>
      <p>"I'm very anxious, I don't really talk to people. But I went in, I ordered what I normally order and I think he was trying to be banterous with me but it did not come off that way.</p>

      <p>"He essentially just made fun of me for ordering pizza and it kind of felt like he was making fun of unhealthy habits.</p>
      <p>"It came across like he was picking on me. There were other people in the store and he kept saying that I was in there every single day.</p>
      <p>"I wish I had the income that would allow me to be at Greggs every single day but I don't.</p>
      <p>"When I said this he argued with me about it. During the interaction I also told him he was making me feel very anxious and he ignored it."</p>
      <p>Greggs has since issued Kathy with an apology, a £6.00 voucher and said that 'things are going to be done' as the staff member's conduct had been flagged to the area manager.</p>
