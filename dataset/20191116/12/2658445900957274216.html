      <p>A Federal High Court, sitting in Kaduna, Kaduna State, has vacated an order of interim forfeiture, earlier granted against the Executive Secretary of the Border Communities Development Agency (BCDA), Captain Junaid Abdullahi.</p>
      <p>The Assets Management Company of Nigeria(AMCON) had filed a suit, with file number FHC/KD/CS/76/2018, against First Aviation Limited and Abdullahi over a loan advance the company obtained from a bank that assets management company had taken over.</p>
      <p>However, Abdullahi, who was one a leading figure in the company before his appointment to the BCDA, was already out of the organisation before the AMCON started its litigation against the company.</p>
      <p>He told The Nation that the inclusion of his name as a party to the legal matter was an error that was already being corrected.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, November 12, 2019, the Federal High Court in Kaduna, presided over by Justice Z.B Abubakar, granted a relief sought by the Plaintiff, AMCON, the court vacated the order of interim forfeiture earlier granted against him.</p>

      <p>According to the court order, a copy of which was made available to The Nation in Abuja, the court said “it is hereby ordered as follows: The term of Settlement dated 7th November, 2019, and filed on the same date, is entered as the Final Judgment of this Court in this suit.</p>
      <p>“The Order Ex-parte made on 3rd October, 2019 is hereby set aside”, the court said.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the development, Abdullahi, in a terse response, said he had no reason to be part of the court matter in the first instance, adding the he was no longer part of First Aviation Limited and expressed confidence that the company can manage itsaffairs.</p>
      <p>“The Federal High Court sitting in Kaduna has vacated the Interim Forfeiture order against my property and bank accounts granted to AMCON via a motion ex parte.</p>
      <p>“I am no longer on the board of First Aviation Limited and I have no further interest in the matter. First Aviation Limited as a corporate entity is quite capable of managing it’s own affairs,” Abdullahi said.</p>
