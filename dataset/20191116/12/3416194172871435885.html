      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/gaten-matarazzo/"><b>Gaten Matarazzo</b></a> is opening up about getting recognized more often.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old actor has two shows on Netflix right now – <i><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/stranger-things/"><b>Stranger Things</b></a></i> and <i>Prank Encounters</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Gaten</b> recently shared a story of the length fans go to get a photo and how would prefer they go about it.</p>
      <p>“I was at Starbucks today and someone was sneaking a photo through the window and videotaping me. It almost feels like that <i>Black Mirror</i> episode,” he told <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/3145668/gaten-matarazzo-stranger-things-prank-encounters/">MTV</a>.</p>
      <p>“I get why people do it. But I’d much rather people come up and talk to me,” <b>Gaten</b> added. “It feels creepy when I look around and people are taking pictures [of me]. I feel uncomfortable doing what I want and being myself.”</p>
