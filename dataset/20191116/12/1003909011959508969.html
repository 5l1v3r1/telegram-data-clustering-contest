      <h1>Chorney-Booth: Lately feeds customers well into the night</h1>

      <p>While it’s certainly been getting better over the last decade or so, Calgary has traditionally not had much of a scene when it comes to late night eats. Emerge from an evening concert or a late movie at midnight and your best bet for grub is likely a fast-food drive-through or a slapped-together grilled cheese sandwich at home.</p>
      <p>For Calgarians who like to hit the clubs, food options tend to be particularly dismal — clubs are great for drinking and dancing, but partiers who haven’t fueled up before a night out often find themselves out of luck if they find themselves hungry for a decent meal. Lately, a new restaurant on 17th Avenue SW, aims to bridge that gap between the early-hours restaurant and late-night club.</p>
      <p>Lately is the brainchild of Ronnie Mupambwa, a local DJ and businessman who has been part of Calgary’s club scene since he arrived in Calgary about a decade ago. He partnered with David Martin to take over the roomy space that was occupied by Chianti for as long as most Calgarians can remember. More of a lounge than a club, the sleek room is filled with cushy booths and banquettes and Instragram-worthy neon signs, designed for a relaxed night out. Mupambwa looks at it a more mature version of club life — patrons can get dressed up and come and drink and socialize, listen to music and, perhaps most importantly, eat.</p>
      <p>“We really wanted to create something that was a hybrid of a restaurant and a lounge,” Mupambwa says. “So people can come in and have a nice cocktail and sit down and catch up with their friends and listen to a DJ.”</p>

      <p>Lately’s menu isn’t necessarily revolutionary, but it is satisfying and the kitchen is open until 2 a.m. Those just looking to have some snacks to help balance out night of cocktail sipping can share orders of housemade meatballs stuffed with Grana Padano cheese ($13), fish or chicken tacos topped with avocado lime crema ($11) or a plate of truffle fries with garlic Parmesan aioli ($10). Patrons looking for a full meal deal can opt for grilled salmon in a fragrant coconut lemongrass sauce served over a rice pilaf ($19) or a house-cut New York striploin with garlic mashed potatoes ($29) and larger groups can try “The Lately,” a mixed grill platter designed to feed the entire table ($75). This choose-your-own-adventure style of eating makes customers feel welcome to linger all night or just pop in for a quick drink and a bite without worrying about the rules of more formal dining.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, November 7, 10 of Calgary’s top chefs competed at the Calgary leg of the Canadian Culinary Championships, which was held at Canada’s Great Kitchen Party, the annual charity gala that raises money for B2ten, MusiCounts and Community Food Centres Canada. This year’s winner was Shokunin’s Jenny Kang — one of Calgary’s most talented but largely unsung culinary artisans (and, if I may note, the only woman in the entire competition). Her winning dish “Sea Garden Eden” was a tableau of ahi tuna, side stripe prawn, scallop and other gems of the sea, seasoned and plated to perfection. Kenny Kaechele of Workshop Kitchen + Culture took the silver medal with his delicious pork collar verde roti and Rouge’s Darnell Japp came in third with a rich braised wagyu and foie gras ravioli. Kang will go on to compete in the national finals in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Nicole Gomes, the co-owner of Cluck and Cleaver and one of Western Canada’s most celebrated chefs, has announced that she has sold her Nicole Gourmet catering company to local husband and wife duo Camilla Sherret and Newell Orfei, who will operate the company as Gather Catering. Sherret and Orfei had been working at Nicole Gourment for the last year to make sure that they could keep up to Gomes’ famously high standards — the name has changed, but the quality of the food promises to stay the same. For more information, visit gathercatering.ca</p>
      <p>Spud.ca, the long-running produce delivery service is now letting customers add alcohol to their weekly Spud boxes. As Calgary’s first delivery service to offer alcohol, Spud now includes local products like Tool Shed beer, SunnyCider ciders, spirits from Confluence Distilling and a selection of wine from Vine Arts. Customers need to be at home and present valid ID to receive their alcohol deliveries.</p>
      <p>Finally, a big happy birthday to Modern Steak, whose Kensington location just celebrated its fifth anniversary. Since five years is usually considered the typical lifespan of a restaurant and Modern Steak is still going strong with its exclusive selection of local ranch-specific beef, having opened a second location on Stephen Avenue almost exactly one year ago, it is indeed a milestone worth noting.</p>
