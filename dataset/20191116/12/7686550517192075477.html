        <figcaption>Merthyr coach Dale McIntosh goes crazy on his team - even though they won</figcaption>

      <p>Merthyr RFC's players could be forgiven for expecting a celebratory Friday night after securing a dramatic last-minute victory over Llandovery in the Welsh Premiership.</p>
      <p>Sadly, they were mistaken.</p>
      <p>Despite Matthew Jarvis' late penalty ensuring a 33-31 win at The Wern, coach Dale McIntosh was far from happy. In fact, he was furious.</p>
      <p>As the final whistle blew, McIntosh, who recently returned from helping to coach Namibia at the Rugby World Cup, could be seen menacingly pacing the touchline shaking his head in anger.</p>
      <p>And, as the BBC Scrum V punditry team picked through the bones of the game, McIntosh could be seen, and partly heard, in the background tearing into his players as if they'd just been demolished by 50 points.</p>

      <p>There were more than a few expletives as the players huddled together to face the wrath of their coach who was angry about the ill-disciplined performance he had just witnessed.</p>
      <p>Asked how he was feeling by Scrum V's Phil Steele immediately afterwards, he said: "Angry. I'm angry. They gave a hell of a lot of effort and Llandovery were excellent tonight. They just wouldn't go away.</p>

      <p>"But we gave them an armchair ride, you know. Our discipline was horrific from guys I admire and guys I respect. They let us down. That's how simple it gets.</p>
      <p>"I'm so angry because I keep on saying it and saying it and saying it and it is not registering. So it starts kind of looking a bit disrespectful. Not to me, I don't care about me, but to their team-mates and to the club and to the jersey. So that's why I'm angry."</p>
