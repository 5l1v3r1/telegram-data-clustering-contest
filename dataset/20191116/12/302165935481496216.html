      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 16 — Umno’s Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein has warned Barisan Nasional (BN) against complacency despite announcing a landslide victory in the Tanjung Piai by-election.</p>
      <p>The former party vice-president said the coalition must self-reflect, and see how it can get public support to return to it.</p>
      <p>“But I remind everybody that we should not be arrogant as this is Tanjung Piai,” he told the press here.</p>
      <p>“We still have a lot of work to do to convince the public that BN is back on the right track,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Sembrong MP said the unofficial result so far was overwhelming and beyond BN”sexpectations.</p>
      <p>“Basically I believe that its a reflection of the solidarity amongst the BN component parties that we managed to achieve this,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We could not have done this without the support of all components as the understanding is in Umno, MCA and MIC.</p>
      <p>“This is what the people are looking for,” said Hishammuddin.</p>
      <p>BN had earlier announced that it has won the Tanjung Piai by-election here, claiming that it has secured 75 per cent of the votes.</p>
      <p>Latest unofficial results released by the Election Commission showed that BN is leading in the Tanjung Piai by-election so far by a whopping majority of 14,123 votes.</p>
      <p>BN has now garnered 23,621 votes compared to Pakatan Harapan’s 9,498 votes.</p>
