      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 is calling for everyone's attention. We like how ex-contestants of the reality show are taking a keen interest in the latest season. Gauahar Khan who appeared as a Quality Controller on one of the Weekend Ka Vaar's is quite active in sharing her thoughts through social media. Recently, she blasted Hindustani Bhau for body-shaming Mahira Sharma as he called her 'Bade Hoth Wali Chipkali'. She also praised Devoleena for taking Mahira's side and pointing out the wrong in the house. Without taking names, she blasted Arti Singh too.</p>
      <p>Gauhar Khan wrote, "Kya yaar , koi aadmi bhains bula raha hai, koi bade hoth waali chipkali , aur doosri ladki jo har mudde mein Zaroor ghusti hain , bolti hain , EK numberrrrr !Wow ! The only one who spoke correctly addressing the issue of body shaming was devoleena , uspar bhi aapatti thi unko!." The tweet has been deleted by Gauahar and we wonder why!Â </p>

      <p>Earlier too, Gauahar had pointed out that the term 'bahu' is being used in a derogatory inside the house and she had blasted Shefali Jariwala for speaking on Devoleena's dressing sense. Bahu bani Babe Devoleena sure seems to be Gauahar Khan's favourite contestant of this season.</p>

      <p>Among the ex-contestants, it's not just Gauahar Khan though who is so engrossed in the latest season. Stars like Kishwer Merchant, Kamya Panjabi, Ajaz Khan, Dolly Bindra and many others are sharing their thoughts on social media about Bigg Boss 13. Some are supporting Sidharth Shukla whose aggressive nature has always been the talking point, while some are against him.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/gauaharkhan</i></p>
