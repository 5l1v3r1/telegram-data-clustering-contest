      <h1>Nick Diaz to Jorge Masvidal: Give fans that real s—t they want to see</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Anton Tabuena</a></address>
      <p>Nick Diaz was back in the public eye, recently having a lengthy — and somewhat concerning — interview with ESPN. During that appearance, the elder Diaz spoke about his younger brother’s last foe, Jorge Masvidal. The former Strikeforce champion said <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20960257/nick-diaz-bmf-jorge-masvidal-nate-ufc-244-mma-news-ariel-helwani-dana-white-video">he’s the rightful owner of that BMF title</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/12/20961532/ufc-mma-news-interview-nick-diaz-president-dana-white-comeback-fight">took offense to Masvidal’s “baptizing” comments</a> towards Nate.</p>
      <p>Days later and it looks like he’s really asking for that contest. Diaz took to Instagram to seemingly call out Masvidal again.</p>

      <p>“Thank you @arielhelwani for letting me come on had a long week I was a little worked up,” Diaz wrote. “@gamebredfighter @ufc give the fans that Real shit what they wanna see ”</p>
      <p>Pundits like Chael Sonnen liked the storyline on a potential Nick Diaz vs Jorge Masvidal match up, saying <a href="http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/15/20965928/ufc-chael-sonnen-nick-diaz-jorge-masvidal-something-special-big-brother-stepped-in-mma-news">“there would be something special if big brother stepped in.”</a> The competitiveness of that bout though, would be highly questionable.</p>

      <p>Even ignoring the fact that he has been seemingly just partying his way in Las Vegas the last couple of years, Diaz is now 36-years-old and hasn’t fought in about five years. For his last win, you’ll have to go further back to over eight years ago when he decisioned B.J. Penn in 2011.</p>
      <p>Masvidal, on the other hand, is in the peak of his career and likely on his way to a title shot. His one-sided victory over Nate Diaz made it three straight big stoppage wins over top level fighters like Darren Till and Ben Askren.</p>
