        <b>Manchester United and Tottenham target Bruno Fernandes has given an update on his future plans ahead of the opening of the January transfer window.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/bruno-fernandes"><b>Fernandes</b></a> was heavily linked with <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/woodward-reveals-truth-behind-man-utd-pursuit-of-bruno-fernandes"><b>United</b></a>, Spurs and Real Madrid in the closing stages of the summer window but a deal did not get over the line.</p>
      <p>He eventually signed a new big-money contract with the Portuguese giants and he insists he will not force his way out of the club in January.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old did reiterate, however, that he has “dreams to come true”, hinting he may still look to pursue a move to the Premier League in the future.</p>

      <p>Speaking after Portugal’s 6-0 thumping of Lithuania, Fernandes said: “I’m not worried, since 2016 I’m at Sporting and they say I’m leaving, so far I’m fine.</p>
      <p>“I have dreams to come true, but I’m not worried, I have no reason to force out, I’m fine, in a club I like.</p>
      <p>“On the day I have to leave, if I have to, I hope to leave a good memory.”</p>
      <p>United are still said to be looking at Fernandes as a replacement for Paul Pogba, while <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tottenham-told-cheeky-e40m-summer-bid-could-now-be-accepted-in-january"><b>Spurs are after the player to supplement the expected loss of Christian Eriksen</b></a> either in January or next summer.</p>
