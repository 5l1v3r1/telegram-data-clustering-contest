      <p>This year, Children’s Day was quite special as many Bollywood celebs treating us with throwback pictures of them. Some chose to share their childhood photos and videos while others did something pretty interesting on that day and one of them is Varun Dhawan. Well, on the occasion of Baal diwas, the Kalank actor took to his Instagram account and shared a very interesting video where he is seen narrating a scene with a lot of intensity. Though it did make us chuckle a bit, his friends like Arjun Kapoor, Anushka Sharma went all out to make fun of him.</p>
      <p>While sharing the video, he wrote, “Keep the child Alive in you. Doesn’t matter what everyone thinks. Happy children’s day. P.s- i have the flu so im on antibiotics.” However, as soon as the video was uploaded, his industry friends started making fun of it. Arjun Kapoor commented saying, “U need medicine.” While his Sui Dhaaga co-star Anushka Sharma commented, “You deserve an award for this. Just for mugging it up you deserve!” On a totally unrelated note, Jacqueline Fernandez said, “You look more and more like Rohit!!!” Watch the video in question:</p>

      <p>Other celebs like Mahira Khan completely trolled him and wrote, “Wow!

Which child came alive in you @varundvn Also share your prescription bro pls, it’s an interesting antibiotic you’re on.” Isn’t this hilarious?</p>

      <p>Varun usually keeps posting such quirky videos on his handle. For his upcoming film Coolie No. 1, Dhawan used to post his prep up videos which left us in splits many times. This film also stars Sara Ali Khan and directed by his father David Dhawan.</p>
