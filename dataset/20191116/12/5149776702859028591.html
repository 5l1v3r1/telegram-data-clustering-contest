      <h1>Transfer targets and selection dilemmas - things for Nottingham Forest to consider in the international break</h1>
      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest news | The Reds are in fifth place in the Sky Bet Championship table going into the final international break of the calendar year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:42:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest head into the final international break of 2019 in fifth place in the Sky Bet Championship table.</p>
      <p>The 1-0 win over arch rivals Derby County saw the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Reds</a> maintain their place in the play-off spots, and are five points adrift of league leaders West Bromwich Albion with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>So what does manager Sabri Lamouchi need to focus on during this latest international break? We have a look at some points to consider…</p>
      <h3>The return of Dawson</h3>

      <p>Forest skipper Michael Dawson has been sidelined with a calf injury for over a month, but could come back into the fold after the international break.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old has missed the Reds’ last six league matches due to injury, but made himself available for selection for the win over Derby last week.</p>
      <p>In Dawson’s place, Joe Worrall has been partnered by either Tobias Figueiredo or Chema at the heart of the Reds defence.</p>
      <p>Since Dawson picked up his injury in the 3-2 win over Stoke City, Forest have claimed three victories, held to one draw and suffered two defeats.</p>

      <p>Prior to Dawson’s injury, Forest had lost just one of the nine matches in which he featured, which came on the opening day against West Brom.</p>
      <p>Should the captain return to the starting line-up to face Bristol City in just over a weeks time, then Lamouchi faces a tough decision on having to drop Figueiredo who helped keep a clean sheet against Derby.</p>
      <h3>Midfield battle</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>When fully fit, Lamouchi has a large squad of players to chose from, and one area of the pitch which is proving to be the most competitive is in midfield.</p>
      <p>Ryan Yates has recently returned from a knee injury, which flared up when he reported back for pre-season training, and he underwent surgery in the summer.</p>
      <p>He made his return in the defeat to Hull City last month when he came off the bench for the final half hour at the KCOM Stadium.</p>
      <p>Yates has since featured against Luton Town and Derby in his last two matches.</p>
      <p>Samba Sow will also be hoping to play a part in Lamouchi’s midfield after the international break, with the 30-year-old expected to be fit after recovering from a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>The same could be said for Alfa Semedo who has been hampered with a back injury in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Lamouchi faces a tough decision on who to select and who to leave out in the midfield when the Reds resume their season next week.</p>
      <h3>Lolley-Carvalho conundrum</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>If you were to ask Forest supporters who the most talented players at the club are, quite a lot would say one of Joe Lolley and Joao Carvalho.</p>
      <p>The pair are both tasked with providing the Reds with goals, as well as service to striker Lewis Grabban.</p>
      <p>Lolley has made 16 appearances for Forest this season, missing just one Championship match, and has three goals and provided two assists.</p>
      <p>Carvalho is yet to score in his nine Championship outings this term, but did find the back of the net in Forest’s Carabao Cup win over Derby back in August.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese Under-21 international has struggled to maintain his place in Lamouchi’s starting line-up, while Lolley’s goal output has dried up in recent matches, with his last strike coming against Blackburn Rovers at the start of October.</p>
      <p>When Lolley and Carvalho are at their best, so are Forest, and Lamouchi will be keen to find a way for their duo to recapture their form after the international break.</p>
      <h3>Transfer targets</h3>

      <p>A topic that gets discussed more and more often as the New Year approaches – what signings will be made during the January transfer window?</p>
      <p>There’s not too many areas of the pitch where the Reds are short of cover and ability, but up front is certainly one.</p>
      <p>Grabban is a high quality striker, but the Reds have struggled for goals when he is not in the side.</p>
      <p>On-loan forward Rafa Mir is yet to make his mark since his arrival from Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer, and Lamouchi may be keen to add to his striker options in January.</p>
      <p>There could be a decision to make about whether to recall Tyler Walker from his loan spell, given he has been banging them in for Lincoln City.</p>
      <p>One thing is clear, a decision will have to be made during the break about whether Forest will dip into the transfer market when the window opens on January 1.</p>
