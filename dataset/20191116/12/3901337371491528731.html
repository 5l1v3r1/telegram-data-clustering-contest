      <p>Sancho rose to prominence in the Bundesliga last season and has reportedly attracted interest from the likes of the Red Devils and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The English winger left Manchester City in search of regular game time, but former Reds defender Steve Nicol feels Sancho would be making a mistake by joining United.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s crazy if he goes to Man Utd.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking about he’s struggling in a team that’s struggling (Dortmund) - Man United are going to be struggling for a couple of seasons, so I would stay away from there.”</p>
      <p>“Well, if I was advising him, let me put it that way, I would like to see him at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“I think he would be fantastic. If he could get his head round playing second fiddle to Mane and Salah, then that would be huge for Liverpool in my opinion.</p>
      <p>“They could save the legs of both of those two and kind of swap the three of them in and out.</p>
      <p>“But he’s not going to do that, he’s going to go somewhere to play. So I think Liverpool’s out.”</p>
