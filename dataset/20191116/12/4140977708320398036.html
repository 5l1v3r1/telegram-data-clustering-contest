          <p>During the third day of the first Test of the ongoing Bangladesh’s tour of India in Indore, India beat Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs to go 1-0 up in the two-match series.</p>
          <p>India bundled out Bangladesh for 213 in 69.2 overs in the second innings. Having registered bowling figures of 16-7-31-4, fast bowler Mohammed Shami was the pick of Indian bowlers today. Other than Shami, spinners Ravichandran Ashwin (3) and fast bowlers Umesh Yadav (2) and Ishant Sharma (1) were also among the wickets.</p>

                <p>The fast bowling trio of Shami, Yadav and Sharma attended a post-match interview in which they hilariously opened up on various facets of the sport. Having played a couple of hard-hitting cameos against South Africa and <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/umesh-yadav-hits-3-outrageous-sixes-vs-bangladesh-to-bring-the-dressing-room-to-life/">Bangladesh</a>, Yadav is contributing equally well with the bat in hand.</p>
                <p>“We [lower-order batsmen] try to score as much as possible. If the last four make 25 [runs] each, that’s 100 for the team. Batting coach [Vikram Rathour] and captain [Virat Kohli] just ask me to enjoy our batting.</p>

                      <p>“In Ranchi [vs South Africa], Virat asked me to score quickly. I just went out to try and hit, it came off the middle and you feel confident. There have been times in England when I have stayed with the batsman. Now it was time to enjoy, so I just did that,” Yadav was vocal about his big-hitting skills.</p>

                          <h3>Ishant Sharma asks Mohammed Shami secret behind taking wickets</h3>
                          <p>Sharma, who made his Test debut (2007) much before Yadav (2011) and Shami (2013), disclosed his fellow fast bowlers not at all treating him like a senior. Having played 95 Tests, Sharma will soon become only the second Indian fast bowler to play 100 Test matches.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>“They don’t treat me like a senior [all laugh]. Yes, it’s a healthy competition [among us] and it should be there. It aids in improving the performance. I’m only 31 but the body feels old due to bowling for so many years,” Sharma said.</p>
                            <p>The second Test at the Eden Gardens will be day-night match with the pink ball, a first-ever instance for both the teams. Being asked about the same, Sharma sought advice from Shami who has done well with the pink ball in the past.</p>
                            <p>“Looking forward to the pink-ball Test. When Shami played with the pink ball, he picked five wickets in 11 overs [13.4-2-42-5]. I am asking Shami regarding his process. He keeps on taking all kinds of wickets but I am fed up of just beating the batsmen [laughs],” Sharma added.</p>
                            <h3>“Yeh biryani ka kamaal hai…”</h3>
                            <p>A modest Shami credited the likes of Sharma and Yadav for continually picking wickets in this format. Before concluding the hilarious interview, Shami ended up giving another amusing reply.</p>
                            <p>“The biggest positive for me is that I have the freedom of the captain and coach. Bowling alongside bowlers like you also helps. You people make things easy for me. There’s no pressure.</p>
                            <p>“<i>Dekho, logon ne kaha hai ki yeh biryani ka kamaal lekin aisa nahin hota hai. Bas allah ka karam hai ki line aur length execute ho rahi hai </i>[People say that it’s because of biryani but that is not true. By the grace of god, I am able to execute the correct line and length],” Shami concluded. Watch the full video below:</p>
