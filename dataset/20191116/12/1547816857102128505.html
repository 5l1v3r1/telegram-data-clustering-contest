      <p>One Plus Music Festival featuring Katy Perry and Dua Lipa has sent everyone in a tizzy. Fans are going gaga as they are awaiting to see the awesome performances by the two. But before Dua Lipa hits the stage, the singer made a quick stop and met the one and only Bollywood’s King Shah Rukh Khan. That’s right! Shah Rukh himself shared a few photos on his Twitter handle where he is seen posing with the gorgeous singer Dua Lipa.</p>
      <p>While sharing the pictures, he said that he has decided to live by ‘new rules’ and he has learnt it from none other than Dua Lipa. Before she heads to the concert, King Khan wished her all his love. Not only that, he also urged Lipa to try the steps he taught her on stage. He wrote, “Have decided to live by ‘New Rules’ and who better to learn them from but @DUALIPA herself!! What a charming and beautiful young lady....&amp; her voice!! Wish her all my love for the concert tonight. Dua if you can, try the steps I taught u on stage.” Well, Lipa, if you are going to do some steps on stage, especially the ones which SRK taught you then oh boy, you'll be forever our favourite.</p>
