      <p>President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday signed a law on the unbundling of natural gas transmission operations from Naftogaz of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>That's according to Deputy Head of the Presidential Office, Yulia Kovaliv.</p>
      <p>"The law fulfills conditions put forward by the EU legislation regarding the separation of gas transmission operations and activities of the GTS operator," Kovaliv wrote on Fracebook.</p>
      <p>Kovaliv emphasized that, despite certain attempts to block and delay decision-making, Ukraine is steadily moving towards European integration and is demonstrating willingness to certify the gas transmission system operator in accordance with EU rules and the Third Energy Package.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law that provides for the unbundling of the gas transmission system of Ukraine from National Joint Stock Company Naftogaz of Ukraine, while retaining the infrastructure in state ownership.</p>
      <p><b>UNIAN memo</b>. Unbundling is the separation of natural gas transmission operations (activities of the GTS Operator) from production and supply of natural gas and electric energy.</p>
      <p>It is assumed that effective <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10736526-following-unbundling-gts-to-remain-in-state-ownership-pm-honcharuk.html">unbundling </a>will become the key to the formation of an independent operator of the Ukrainian gas transmission system, certified by European requirements. Such an operator will strengthen the position and role of Ukraine in the negotiation process with the Russian Federation on the extension of transit and preservation of the Ukrainian gas transmission after the end of 2019 when the existing gas transit contract with Russia's Gazrpom expires.</p>
