      <p>KABUL -- Two federal prosecutors have been shot dead by unidentified gunmen as they were driving to Bagram Airfield, north of the capital, Kabul.<br/><br/>Jamshid Rasouli, spokesman for the national Attorney General’s Office, said two other prosecutors were wounded in the attack on November 16.<br/><br/>According to Rasouli, the prosecutors were heading to the prison at Bagram Airfield, which has held top-level Taliban detainees, including Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of Sirajjuddin Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani militant network.<br/><br/>Anas Haqqani and two other Taliban prisoners were supposed to be freed on November 15 in exchange for an American and an Australian national.<br/><br/>But the Taliban said the three prisoners didn’t show up at an exchange site agreed upon with the United States.<br/><br/>They were to be exchanged for two professors of the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who were abducted in August 2016: U.S. citizen Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks.<br/><br/>A Taliban spokesman said on November 15 that the Taliban was still holding King, 60, and Weeks, 48.<br/><br/>Reuters on November 15 quoted an Afghan government official as saying the swap had been postponed, without elaborating.<br/><br/>The agency also cited Taliban sources as saying the three Taliban prisoners were due to be flown to Qatar but were returned to the jail in Bagram, outside Kabul.<br/><br/>They “will be sent to Qatar under U.S. supervision,” an unnamed Afghan official told RFE/RL on November 15.</p>
      <p>President Ashraf Ghani’s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said on November 16 that the three were still in government custody. He didn’t say what went wrong with the exchange.</p>
      <p>Sediqqi said the Afghan government “was in the process of reviewing the exchange of prisoners and will make a decision based on the country’s national interest.”</p>
      <p>The Haqqani network, known for carrying out brutal attacks in Afghanistan, is part of the Taliban group.<br/><br/>It is believed to be based in Pakistan.</p>
