      <h1>Gasly's "confidence is growing" again with Toro Rosso</h1>

        <b>Christian Horner says that <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> has been driving "exceptionally well" since his return to Toro Rosso during the summer break. Gasly has been in great from since the Belgian Grand Prix, scoring points in four of seven races, with his new teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniil-kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a> only managing two top tens.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gasly endured a horrid time at Aston Martin Red Bull Racing in the first 12 races of the season, scoring just over a third of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>'s points before being controversially replaced by Toro Rosso rookie <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a>.</p>

      <p>But since his return to the junior team he has shown why the powers that be at Red Bull Racing promoted him in the first place.</p>
      <p>Horner said in the press conference ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix: <i>"For Pierre, it was a difficult first half of the season for him.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Obviously we felt that with the pressure building on him, the public pressure, the media scrutiny, it was right to remove him from that and put him into the slightly less pressured environment of Toro Rosso.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"And since that switch I think he has driven again exceptionally well. You can see his confidence is growing. Heâ€™s driven some very strong races and his pace is getting better and better. He looks happier in that environment, which is good to see."</i>
