        <li>Thanks to leaps and bounds in the field of artificial intelligence in the past decade, <a href="https://businessinsider.com/category/artificial-intelligence">robots</a> are increasingly beating humans at our own games.</li>
        <li>AI-powered programs have proven their prowess at competitive games and academic tests alike throughout the past 10 years.</li>
        <li>Many advances in AI can’t be quantified with competitions or challenges, but robots’ victories at games ranging from Jeopardy to Dota show how far AI has come.</li>

      <p>When IBM’s Deep Blue chess machine defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, the world responded with surprise and angst at how far computers had come: “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/be-afraid-9802">Be Afraid</a>,” read a Weekly Standard headline reacting to the news.</p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence has since made advancements that were unthinkable just 20 years ago – in the past decade alone, robots have achieved dominance over humans in games far more complex than chess.</p>
      <p>While most of those advances can’t be quantified with milestones like chess victories, programmers have continued the tradition of building machines designed to outsmart humans at our own games.</p>
      <p>Here’s a comprehensive list of the competitions, games, and challenges that robots beat humans at in the past decade.</p>

      <h3>2011: IBM’s Watson beats two former champions to win Jeopardy</h3>

      <p>Facial recognition technology has only become more sophisticated since Facebook achieved that <a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification/">milestone</a> in 2014. However, some research has <a href="http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/Publications/Face/BlantonAllenMillerKalkaJain_CVPRWB2016_HID.pdf">questioned</a> whether human facial recognition can accurately be compared to AI facial recognition.</p>

      <p>In the years following AlphaGo’s 2015 victories, it went on to defeat several other international champions, and by 2017 it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/30/libratus-poker-artificial-intelligence-professional-human-players-competition">able to win 60 rounds of Go</a> back-to-back.</p>

      <p>Unlike Chess or Go, poker is an imperfect information game, meaning players have to guess each others’ hands – making Libratus’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/30/libratus-poker-artificial-intelligence-professional-human-players-competition">victory</a> all the more impressive.</p>
