      <p>Kate Middleton stumbled as she was getting into her car after a royal engagement.</p>
      <p>The royal couple were attending a charity event in London for their volunteer text support service Shout.</p>
      <p>Kate, who was wearing black block heels tripped on the way into the car after the couple left the Troubadour White City Theatre.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Cambridge, 37 was seen holding out a hand to support her, but it was alright as the Duchess stood back up and they smiled at each other over the minor stumble before going into the car to leave the event.</p>
      <p>Kate dressed in smart separates instead of her usual elegant dresses at the event.</p>
      <p>Crisis text support service Shout was launched by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in May.</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge wore a Smythe £620 blazer and £345 Joseph trousers which looked like new outfits for her wardrobe.</p>
      <p>Kate paired the outfit with a £520 black block Gianvito Rossi heels.</p>

      <p>The royal had her shiny brunette hair styled in curls and deep side parting.</p>
      <p>She also wore a stronger make-up look than normal with dark eyeshadow, defined brows and contoured cheekbones.</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge was elegant and demure throughout the event before tripping afterwards when she alighted the royal car.</p>
      <p>She was walking down the stairs of the Troubadour White City Theatre after saying goodbye to the organisers of the event.</p>
      <p>However, Kate stumbled on the uneven ground as she approached the royal car and Prince William holds out his hand to support her.</p>
      <p>The couple grinned at each other over the minor slip up and they were laughing as they went inside the car and left the venue.</p>
      <p>The Shout event brought together people from all over the UK who volunteer around the clock to support people in crisis.</p>
      <p>Prince William and Kate, together with Prince Harry and Meghan appealed to the public to give their time to the charity six months ago to mark the charity’s official opening.</p>
      <p>There are 1,500 volunteers who had 145,000 text conversations with people in crisis, exchanging a total of six million messages in the past six months.</p>
      <p>Out of those who have contacted Shout, three-quarters of them are under 25 and the most common issues raised are self-harm, anxiety, depression, suicide, relationships and isolation.</p>
      <p>The event is an opportunity for the virtual community to meet and see the scale of the national network they have joined as volunteers access their shifts from computers in their own homes.</p>
      <p>Prince William and Kate Middleton joined Shout volunteers in the theatre to watch a special performance before joining a group photo with volunteers to encourage everyone to spread the word about Shout.</p>
