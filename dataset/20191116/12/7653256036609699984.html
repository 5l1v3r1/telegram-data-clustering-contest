      <p>SABARIMALA: Amid tight security, the gates of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Lord-Ayyappa">Lord Ayyappa</a> temple at <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sabarimala">Sabarimala</a> were thrown open for the two-month long Mandala-Makaravilakku <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kandararu-Mahesh-Mohanararu">Kandararu Mahesh Mohanararu</a> opened the sanctum sanctorum of the temple at 5 pm, and performed the poojas, as hundreds of devotees from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and other neighbouring states thronged the shrine located in a reserve forest of the Western Ghats in Pathanamthitta district of the state.</p>
      <p>Devotees, who were allowed to trek the hill from 2 PM, climbed the sacred 18 steps to the temple with the "irumudikettu" (sacred bag containing the offerings to the Lord) after the priests performed the "padi pooja".</p>
      <p>New priests-- A K Sudheer Namboodiri (Sabarimala) and M S Prameshwaran Namboodiri (Malikapuram) later took charge.</p>
      <p>The state and temple precincts had witnessed frenzied protests by right outfits and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a> workers last year after the LDF government decided to implement the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Supreme-court">Supreme court</a>'s verdict of September 28, 2018 allowing women of all age groups to offer prayers at the shrine.</p>
      <p>However, this year, even though the top court had not stayed its verdict on entry of young women into the shrine while posting various petitions on the matter to a larger bench, the government was exercising caution.</p>
      <p>Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran has made it clear that Sabarimala was not a place for activists to display their activism and said the government would not encourage such women who want to visit the shrine for publicity.</p>
      <p>Those who want to visit the temple can procure a court order to enter the temple, he had said.</p>
      <p>The board has made elaborate arrangements to provide maximum amenities to the devotees.</p>
