      <h1>City MOGULS fashion show celebrating entrepreneurship steps up its charitable game in fourth year</h1>
      <h2>In this fashion show with a twist, the event's co-founders pick twenty entrepreneurs each year to strut their stuff on the runway, for a good cause</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:00:18+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">National Post Staff</a></address>
      <p>In 2016, Dani Kagan was co-producing a fashion show when she had the idea to launch a catwalk show of her own — but with a unique twist.</p>
      <p>Instead of ordinary models, the show would star and celebrate Canadian entrepreneurs, all the while supporting a good cause.</p>
      <p>And so City MOGULS was born.</p>
      <p>Kagan, along with co-founders Victoria Marshman and Monica Gold, pick twenty entrepreneurs each year to strut their stuff on the runway. The fourth annual show took place last week in Toronto, with charity partner Covenant House Toronto, an agency for at-risk, homeless or trafficked youth.</p>
      <p>“There were lots of highlights,” Kagan said. “People who are doing really amazing things in the country, starting businesses that are inspiring and innovative.”</p>
      <p>While any entrepreneur or businessperson can nominate themselves or be nominated, City MOGULS looks for those that have a charitable component to their business or who are involved in social enterprise. The entrepreneur must also have been in business for at least five years.</p>
      <p>This year, they narrowed the list down from over 300 nominations.</p>
      <aside>The best thing we’ve done as an organization is connect peopleDani Kagan</aside>
      <p>The 2019 class of MOGULS included Allen Lau, the chief executive officer of Wattpad, Matei Olaru, the CEO of Lift and Co. and La-toya Fagon, a celebrity chef. Previous alumni includes Sarah Wells, a track and field Olympian, Sherren Lee, a film and television director and Johnathan Holland, founder of Curexe.</p>
      <p>City MOGULS’ sponsors include Rogers, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Air Miles.</p>
      <p>According to Kagan, the first standalone show had about 200 people and raised about $5,000 for charity, compared to this year’s increase to 700 attendees and over $150,000 for charity.</p>
      <p>The fashion itself is exclusively Canadian, with the 2019 edition featuring designers like Andrew Coimbra, Christopher Bates and Tara Rivas.</p>
      <p>However, since its inception, City MOGULS has grown into far more than just a fashion show.</p>
      <p>“City MOGULS is a platform to connect entrepreneurs and celebrate entrepreneurship,” Kagan said. “To inspire the next generation of leaders to give back and to ultimately connect.”</p>
      <aside>There were lots of highlights. People who are doing really amazing thingsDani Kagan</aside>
      <p>Since their first iteration they have expanded into events throughout the year.</p>
      <p>“We run a speaker series called Talk the Walk where MOGUL alumni and other MOGULS in the city sit on panels and talk about different topics,” said Kagan.</p>
      <p>They also plan to launch a new membership program called City MOGULS Insider, where they would offer MOGUL boot camps throughout the year both digitally and in-person. Members would also get discounted rates on the speaker series.</p>
      <p>Kagan looks forward to growing the business even further and continuing to connect like-minded entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>“Your biggest asset is your network,” said Kagan. “The best thing we’ve done as an organization is connect people so that they can grow their networks, meet new people, meet new clients and make new friendships.”</p>

        <b>Meet the MOGULS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The following 20 entrepreneurs were selected to be the 2019 City MOGULS:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Allen Lau, Wattpad</b>
      </p>
      <p>Allen Lau is the co-founder and CEO of Wattpad, the story-sharing platform turned entertainment giant that transforms insights from its tens of millions of worldwide monthly users into the stuff of books and movies. Some of those ideas have found their way onto streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, while others may find a home in Wattpad’s recently launched U.S. publishing division. In addition to running Wattpad, Lau is also co-founder of Two Small Fish Ventures, a venture fund that invests in early stage tech companies, and a member of the Council of Canadian Innovators.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Steckel, Setter</b>
      </p>
      <p>The co-founder and president of Setter, David Steckel is a former general contractor who took his hands on skills to the high tech world of startups. Setter is a website that aims to help homeowners connect with local professionals to solve the everyday home maintenance problems, from tree trimming to cabinetry. The startup is backed by the legendary investment fund Sequoia Capital and has offices in Toronto and San Francisco.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Arslan Amin, Clean Meals</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arslan Amin is the CEO and co-founder of Clean Meals, a meal prep delivery service with a focus on health fresh food and gourmet recipes ranging from beanless pumpkin chili to tofu stroganoff. Clean Meals and Amin also support a charitable endeavor called #projectendhunger that deliver meals to the homeless in the GTA. Over the past three years they have increased the number of deliveries from 500 to a goal of 10,000 in 2019.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ilana Ben-Ari, Twenty One Toys</b>
      </p>
      <p>Award-winning toy designer Ilana Ben-Ari’s creations are not all about fun and games. While fun is a big part of the equation, Twenty One Toys is a social enterprise that produces unique education toys that teach skills such empathy, collaboration and even failure. Ben-Ari’s empathy toy has been recognized by Time Magazine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joanna Griffiths, Knix</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joanna Griffiths has no time for “unmentionables.” The founder of Knix Wear makes underwear and bras that actually speak to the intimate lives of the women who wear them. Her company has also encouraged customers to bare it all, both literally, in un-doctored photo shoots wearing Knix products, and figuratively, in stories about their experiences with difficult experiences such as miscarriages and mastectomies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Karine Rashkovsky, Brain Power</b>
      </p>
      <p>Karine Rashkovsky started playing with math puzzles before she entered preschool. And yes, playing is the right word. That’s because her father, a mathematician, emphasized the fun in learning, both with his children and with the kids he tutored after school. That sensibility informed their work together — first on education workbooks, then on a tutoring business together. Today, their approach is the basis for Brain Power, an after-school program for math as well as language arts and skills from coding to public speaking. A PhD in education, Rachovsky is also collaborating with a researcher at York University on expanding the literacy, numeracy and life schools of students who speak a language other than English at home.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Isaac Olowolafe Jr., Dream Maker Inc.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Isaac Olowolafe Jr. would be notable enough for his business acumen. He co-founded Dream Makers, an asset management and real estate firm, with his father — then launched both a successful development arm of the company and a private equity venture focused on small- to medium-sized businesses. But Olowolafe also pays his prosperity forward, by multiples. He was only 26 when he made his first significant donation, an endowment to the African Studies Program at his alma mater University of Toronto. Dream Maker Ventures invests in startups by diverse founders (to the tune of $5 million as of 2018, according to Crunchbase). And this year marks the launch of a new Black Innovation Fellowship at Ryerson University, developed with a lead gift from Olowolafe of $200,000.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James Yurichuk, Wuxley</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Wuxley story is a meet-cute of sorts: between a former pro-football player and a line of warm coats. As the company likes to tell it, James Yurichuk wanted his Brazilian girlfriend to stay cozy north of the equator, so he had a tailor make her a custom parka. It was so warm, it became the basis for a business. But the heart of this match-up is also a love of wildlife. The brand is animal-friendly and cruelty-free, and encourages buyers to share the warmth by trading in down-filled, fur-trimmed coats for credits on new cold-weather wear.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jeff Goldenberg, Abacus</b>
      </p>
      <p>It may sound like an oxymoron but with a decade of experience behind him, Jeff Goldenberg is a rare veteran of the startup scene in Canada. That makes him an ideal strategy sherpa for clients of Abacus, a marketing firm specializing in Facebook and mobile ads co-founded by Goldenberg. But he also gives back as an “entrepreneur in residence” at MaRS and as a mentor with California-based incubator 500 Startups.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jennifer Lau, Fit Squad</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this annum of Andreescu, it can be hard to remember that strength in women isn’t always considered an asset. But Jennifer Lau, a holistic nutritionist, trainer and the co-founder of Toronto gym Fit Squad, has spent a career coaching female clients on embracing their inner toughness. As her team explains on their website, it’s not just about fitness, “We see the gym as the ultimate training ground for life, and an opportunity to evolve who we are every single day.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kyle MacDonald, Capitalize for Kids</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kyle MacDonald was once referred to as a ‘whiz kid’ in the Toronto Star. It’s not hard to see why. A member of the 2009 Vanier Cup winning football team at Queen’s University, within a few years he had gone on to thrive on Bay Street at Ernst and Young and Veritas Investment Research and now at Gallant MacDonald. He co-founded Capitalize for Kids in 2013 in an effort to rally charitable investors to support children’s mental health. He was recognized as one of Canada’s Top 40 under 40 for his business and philanthropic efforts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Katie Zeppieri, Girl Talk Empowerment</b>
      </p>
      <p>Katie Zeppieri is the founder and creative director of Girl Talk Empowerment, which provides a multi-platform support network and leadership opportunities for girls, with the goal to help them make their mark on the world. She is also a social entrepreneur, a motivational speaker and the youngest weekly on-air radio panelist on Toronto’s Newstalk 1010. A recipient of the Governor-General’s ‘Caring Canadian’ award, Zeppieri was also recognized by the YMCA as ‘A Young Woman of Distinction.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nicholas Chepesiuk, OnCall Health</b>
      </p>

It has been adopted by many healthcare organizations across the country including the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Canadian Cannabis Clinics and Wellpoint. Prior to starting OnCall Health, Chepesiuk worked at the education technology company Top Hat.</p>
      <p>
