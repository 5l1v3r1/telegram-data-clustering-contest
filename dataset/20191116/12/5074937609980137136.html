      <h1>Cape Coast showed us love - Dede Ayew</h1>

      <p>Cape Coast, Nov. 15, GNA - The Captain of the Ghana Black Stars, Andre Dede Ayew has commended fans of Cape Coast for the support and unflinching love shown to them in the 2-0 win over South Africa in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"We are grateful to all the people in Cape Coast and the fans that came to the stadium. The stadium was packed and they cheered us. The reception was great here and we really felt loved and at home, that's what this show mean to us," the Swansea City forward stated.</p>
      <p>"One thing I can say is, we would come back and play in Cape Coast again. We cannot say when but we are sure we would comeback. Ghana is a big country and we have lots of big stadiums so we have to share the love to the other cities,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Black Stars got off their 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign on a bright note after recording a comfortable 2-0 victory over the Bafana Bafana at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Stars though started off the game slowly, came in strongly and enjoyed most of the possession with Atletico Madrid mieldfieder, Thomas Partey opening the scoring with a speculative long range in the 35th minute.</p>
      <p>Substitute Kudus Mohammed wrapped up Ghana’s victory in the 80th minutes with a brillant solo effort.</p>
      <p>The love, support and passion of Ghanaians for the Black Stars woefully dwindled after the Anas number 12 expose in 2018.</p>
      <p>The new Ghana Football Association (GFA) headed by Mr Kurt Okraku has initiated a campaign dubbed #BringBackTheLove campaign aimed at igniting passion and galvanising support for the Black Stars and other national teams.</p>
