      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Growth appears to have stopped.</li>
        <li>High-level financial performance continues.</li>
        <li>Dividend at 2.8% yield with .36 payout ratio.</li>
        <li>Value at 11.25 times earnings appropriate for slow or no growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a buy-and-hold trade. Cummins, Inc. (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMI">CMI</a>) designs makes and sells diesel and natural gas powered engines, and related services and components, aftermarket add-ons, and other engine related systems and equipment. They also manufacture and sell industrial power generation equipment and generator technologies products, including electric and hybrid. CMI also operates a distribution network that handles CMI products as well as related products, parts, and services provided by others. At 100 years old, company has over $2.5 billion net income on sales approaching $25 billion, and employs over 62 thousand people in over eight thousand distributor and dealer locations worldwide. Roughly, 35% of sales are from engines, 25% from the distribution segment, 24% through component systems, and about 15% from power systems.</p>
      <p>Although CMI enjoyed 16% sales growth in each of 2017 and 2018, growth in 2019 slowed to about 1.5% (based on the TTM through September 2019). CMI 2019 revenue <a href="https://investor.cummins.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cummins-announces-third-quarter-results">guidance</a>, recently lowered to minus 2%, from the previous flat (year over year) is discouraging. Overall third-quarter revenue was flat for North America, but down about 8% outside the USA. About 10% of CMI revenue comes from China (per <a href="https://www.dieselworldmag.com/diesel-news/cummins-crisis-us-tariffs-to-affect-china-made-parts/">Diesel World</a>), where some engines for truck assembly in the USA are made. These imports back to the USA are subject to the 25% USA tariffs on imports from China. Trade negotiations, the stronger dollar, and weakening European and Asian demand all act as dampers on CMI sales growth.</p>
      <p>CMI has a long history of solid financial results. Gross profit has remained at a steady 25% for the last five years, and although return on sales averages 7.6% for the five-year period, for 2018 and TTM 2019, return on sales improved to 10.7%. Return on invested capital averages about 9.2%, and with a debt to equity ratio of about 1.1, CMI produces a respectable return on equity averaging about 19.2%. Coupled with their financial history is a commitment by management to continue paying out 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders. This translates to a five-year average payout ratio of about .46 times GAAP EPS (.36 for 2019 TTM). CMI's stock is priced for an average annual yield of around three percent.</p>
      <p>For the future, there are several “ifs” to consider. If flat sales are the future, the average return on sales of 7.6% continues, and the low average P/E of about 13 prevails, the stock may stay at or near its current $180 per share level. With a flat sales forecast, if the recently improved return on sales of 10.7% continues, the stock should make a steady rise, by 2024, to the neighborhood of $256 per share with the low average P/E of 13, or as high as $375, with the high average P/E of 19 times earnings.</p>
      <p>Despite CMI’s forecasts of slow to no growth in revenues, over the last five years, consolidated sales have increased by 25.5% (TTM 2019 is $4.9 billion greater than 2014), just over five percent per year. The dividend has grown by 74.4% during the same period, averaging increases of about 12% per year. A forecasting model using an average growth rate of 4.2% (straight line trend, least squares method), the high 10.7% return on sales, and a continuation of the share buyback program, produces expected 2024 EPS of about $24.19 per share, and given the high average P/E of 19, produces an expected price as high as $460 for 2024.</p>
      <p>For the optimist who believes the global economy will renew and continue expansion into the mid-term future, CMI is a reasonable buy-and-hold investment.</p>
