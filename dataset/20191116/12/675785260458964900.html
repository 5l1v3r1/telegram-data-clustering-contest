      <h2>Hannah Rowlinson had planned to give birth at her home in Holmes Chapel, in Cheshire, but was forced to try and reach Royal Stoke Hospital last-minute due to staff shortages</h2>

      <p>A mother-of-two gave birth on the M6 while being driven at 90mph after a loose dog and flooding threw her plans into chaos.</p>
      <p>Hannah Rowlinson had arranged to have her baby in a birthing pool at home - but after having contractions for 48 hours and expecting a midwife imminently, she received a call saying she would need to come into Leighton Hospital in Cheshire.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was then told there were no beds available there or at Macclesfield and they had to go to Royal Stoke - a 45-minute drive from their Holmes Chapel home.</p>
      <p>But after jumping in the car with husband Joel his phone sat-nav died and they ran into traffic caused by floods.</p>

      <p>"I had been having  contractions for so long I hadn't looked outside for days. But when we got going in the car I saw that the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> was horrendous, there were floods everywhere," she told <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/i-baby-m6-90mph-how-3533730">Stoke on Trent Live</a> .</p>
      <p>"As soon as we were out of the house we hit heavy traffic. Apparently there was a dog loose on the M6 as well as the flooding.</p>
      <p>"I said to my husband 'I am going to give birth to this baby imminently', so we diverted our course onto bumpy back lanes with pools of water everywhere, heading towards Sandbach."</p>
      <p>Hannah's mum, who was also in the back of the car, called 999 after they pulled into a residential estate - where the operator helped them prepare the birth process - but she then managed to flag down a police officer to help.</p>
      <p>Eventually an ambulance arrived and paramedics helped her walk barefoot to the stretcher - but just seven minutes into the journey the baby's head was crowning.</p>

      <p>Hannah said: "We were going at 90mph down the motorway and I asked the paramedics to pull over because the baby was coming.</p>
      <p>"The roads were bedlam because of the floods - I didn't even know where I was. There was a coned off area and he pulled in. I did one more push and she was out.</p>
      <p>"I was convinced I was having a boy. It was a good five minutes into the journey to hospital after she had arrived that the paramedics said 'do we know if it's a boy or a girl'. I lifted her up and realised. She was so purple, hence Viola.</p>
      <p>"One of my friends said it must have been a traumatic situation but not once did I ever doubt what was happening. I felt the whole time that it was going to be okay. </p>

      <p>"Yes, it was not the birth I was expecting but everyone was so incredible.</p>
      <p>"There are things in your life that will stick with you forever and this is definitely one of them. I don't have words to describe how grateful I am.</p>
      <p>"I will never forget those two paramedics. Sometimes things don't go to plan, but who needs a plan when you have Garry and Dave?"</p>
