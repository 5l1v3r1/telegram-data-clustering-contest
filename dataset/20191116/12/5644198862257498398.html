      <p>NEW DELHI: Mushfiqur Rahim waged a grim battle for Bangladesh but India continued their march for a comprehensive victory possibly inside three days in the opening test on Saturday.</p>
      <p>After India declared their first innings on their overnight score of 493-6, Bangladesh lost four wickets in the morning session and two more after lunch to be 191-6 at tea and staring at a demoralising defeat.</p>

      <p>Mushfiqur made the most of a reprieve earlier in his knock to be 53 not out, having added 56 runs with Mehidy Hasan Miraz who was unbeaten on 38.</p>
      <p>Earlier, India's massive 343-run first innings lead convinced captain Virat Kohli to declare on their overnight score at Indore's Holkar Cricket Stadium.</p>
      <p>Instead of stretching the lead further, Kohli wanted his quick bowlers to exploit the early morning conditions, which proved a smart decision as Bangladesh lost both their openers inside seven overs.</p>
      <p>Umesh Yadav induced Imrul Kayes into a drive, only for the inside edge to crash into the leg stump.</p>
      <p>In the next over, Ishant Sharma breached the bat-pad gap to sent back Shadman Islam. The openers made six each, mirroring their first innings score.</p>
      <p>Mominul Haque, who made seven, survived a review before falling to one when India challenged the original not-out decision after Mohammed Shami had rapped the Bangladesh captain on his pad.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Mithun hit four boundaries in his 18 but was jolted by a Shami bouncer which he pulled tamely to Mayank Agarwal at midwicket.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh could have been in a bigger hole but Rohit Sharma dropped Mushfiqur in the slip.</p>
      <p>Shami returned after the lunch break to dismiss Mahmudullah and Rohit did not make any mistake this time as he took the catch.</p>
      <p>Liton Das and Mushfiqur tried to resist India with a 63-run stand. Ravichandran Ashwin separated them, taking a sharp return catch to send back Liton who made 35.</p>
      <p>Kolkata hosts the second and final match, which will be the first day-night test for both sides, from Nov. 22.</p>
