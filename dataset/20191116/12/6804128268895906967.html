      <p>West Ham head into their game with Tottenham Hotspur after the international break in a dire run of form which hasn't seen them win a game of football since September 22.</p>
      <p>That victory over Manchester United saw Manuel Pellegrini's side move to joint-third in the table but everything has unravelled since then with defeats to Everton, Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Burnley last time out.</p>
      <p>West Ham have dropped like a stone to 16th and has piled the pressure on Pellegrini as a result, who needs to come up with some answers to his teams wretched form.</p>
      <p>The manager said earlier this week: “We need to keep a cool head and continue working the way we think we must do it better and after that we will see the results."</p>
      <p>What had started out as a very promising campaign has gone into a tailspin and with a tough set of fixtures on the horizon, it could get worse before it gets better for the boys in claret and blue.</p>
      <p>So when it comes to winners and losers, there would have been plenty of them up until late September but now, it's tough to come up with any at all.</p>
      <p>But we've given it a go anyway so here are <b>football.london's</b> winners and losers of West Ham's season so far.</p>
      <h3>Winners</h3>
      <h4>Angelo Ogbonna</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The Italian defender has found himself out of the team for the last three games as Fabian Balbuena has, wrongly, been preferred to Ogbonna and the Hammers have suffered as a result.</p>
      <p>Balbuena's form has been very sketchy since his recall to the side and Ogbonna was one of, if not the, best Hammers player of the course of the early season.</p>
      <p>He's still a winner in our eyes despite the fact he has been axed from the team for three matches. There is plenty of clamour for the experienced defender to be recalled for the visit of Spurs next weekend to London Stadium.</p>
      <p>It shows how much his stock has risen in the eyes of the fanbase in east London.</p>
      <h4>Lukasz Fabianski</h4>
      <p>He's been injured for the past couple of months so this might sound weird to include him as a winner but what his absence has shown is just how important he is to the Hammers team.</p>
      <p>His deputy Roberto has been a disaster since replacing the Pole, who tore a hip muscle in the 2-2 draw at Bournemouth and is expected to be out until after Christmas at least.</p>
      <p>His return cannot come soon enough. Fabianski's absence has proved how vital he is, and how he papered over a few cracks not just this season but also last. Hie is still vastly underrated outside of east London and the reigning Hammer of the Year.</p>
      <h4>Grady Diangana</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The winger is having an excellent time away from the Hammers on loan at Championship table-toppers West Brom, now managed by former Hammers boss Slaven Bilic.</p>
      <p>At the time, it was seen as a very good loan move for the winger who has just penned a six-year contract in east London but needed to get some games under his belt. He has done just that with the Baggies and has been tearing it up for Bilic's side.</p>
      <p>There is a recall option for Diangana to come back to the capital in January but the indications are that he will stay in the Midlands to get a full season of second-tier football under his belt which, to be fair, is the right thing to do as he will only get better for it.</p>
      <h3>Losers</h3>
      <h4>Manuel Pellegrini</h4>
      <p>It's all gone a bit pear-shaped for the £8m-a-year man at the helm in east London with plenty of questioning looks coming his way after the dreadful run of form.</p>
      <p>The manager has stuck to his 4-2-3-1 formation which isn't working, choosing to tinker with personnel rather than the formation. His tactics have been puzzling, as have his team selections on occasions.</p>
      <p>The axing of Ogbonna is a weird one, the selection of Pablo Zabaleta at right back against Newcastle was downright bizarre, Pellegrini's persistence of shoehorning Pablo Fornals into the side as a winger - it has all added up to the pressure being put on the manager.</p>
      <p>He needs to start earning his money between now and 2020 or the Hammers could really be in dire straits and he could find himself out of a job.</p>

      <h4>Roberto</h4>
      <p>To say that the Spanish veteran has had a tough time of things since replacing Fabianski in goal would be the understatement of the century - it's been disastrous.</p>
      <p>Roberto is a good shot stopper, hes made 31 of them already in his six games, but he has also instilled no confidence in his defenders and has committed a couple of glaring gaffes that have cost the team.</p>
      <p>As a veteran and experienced keeper, he shouldn't be making these mistakes. Pellegrini hasn't dug him out in public, which he would never do as he rarely discusses individuals, but he can't be impressed with what he has seen.</p>
      <p>He's not a Premier League quality backup but is still likely to keep his place for the Spurs game as third-choice keeper David Martin is unlikely to be thrown in at the deep end, nor is U23 stopper Joseph Anang and Nathan Trott can't be recalled from his loan at AFC Wimbledon until January.</p>
      <h4>Pablo Fornals</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Like Roberto, another summer recruit in Fornals is struggling to get going in the capital but with the price tag that came with Fornals, it's more of a concern.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard hasn't looked up to the rigours of the Premier League yet, physically especially, as he has yet to notch a goal or assist so far.</p>
      <p>He hasn't been helped by his manager playing him as a winger which is not a natural position for Fornals. However, with Manuel Lanzini's broken collarbone set to keep him sidelined for between six to eight weeks, it could be the time that Fornals starts to come to the fore in a more natural number ten position.</p>
