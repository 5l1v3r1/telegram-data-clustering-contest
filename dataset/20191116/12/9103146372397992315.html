        <b>The ministry implemented the vaccination campaign targeting children under 15 years, in response to Measles and Rubella outbreaks in which 300,000 suspected cases were reported</b>

      <p>
        <b>Nearly a month after the mass vaccination exercise against Measles and Rubella, the health ministry has registered a drastic drop in both diseases.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to journalists at the Uganda Media Centre, health minister Dr Jane Ruth Aceng said only 212 suspected Measles and Rubella cases were registered in the week of November 4<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> as compared to 733 cases that were registered in April this year.</p>
      <p>The Measles, Rubella and Polio campaign was launched on October 15 in Mayuge and implemented countrywide from October 16 to 20. There was an extension of one day nationwide and two days specifically for Karamoja, Wakiso, Mukono and the Karamoja region.</p>
      <p>The ministry implemented the vaccination campaign targeting children under 15 years, in response to Measles and Rubella outbreaks in which 300,000 suspected cases were reported, 46,000 patients admitted with symptoms of the disease and 586 related deaths recorded in the three years’ period of the outbreak.</p>

      <p>Regarding Polio, Uganda continues to defend its polio-free status despite the high risk of importation of polio from neighbouring countries, some of which continue to harbour polio viruses while others have challenged surveillance systems.</p>
      <p>It is therefore against this risk that all children at risk of polio aged 0 to 5 years were vaccinated with the aim of boosting community immunity.</p>
