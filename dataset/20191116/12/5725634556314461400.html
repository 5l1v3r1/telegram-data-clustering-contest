      <p><b><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3519923-dow-cracks-28000-first-time-stocks-swept-trade-optimism">Both the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indexes</a></b> shattered their previous all-time record highs, including a first-ever 28,000 finish on the Dow, sparked by fresh optimism over a potential U.S.-China trade deal. Stocks built momentum through the day after top White House advisor Larry Kudlow said a deal was close, comments that followed reports earlier in the week suggesting the two sides were at odds over the terms of a phase one agreement. Trade-sensitive names such as Boeing, Caterpillar and Apple all rose more than 1%, and stocks in the health care sector (+2.2%) surged after the Trump administration released a plan that would force hospitals and insurance companies to disclose the rates they negotiated. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.9% for its sixth straight week of gains, while the Dow performed even better, climbing 1.2%.</p>

      <p>Final figures from Alibaba's (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA">BABA</a>) 24-hour Singles' Day event showed that sales hit a record $38.4B, more than Amazon's (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN">AMZN</a>) haul last quarter from online store sales. The news didn't move the stock on Monday, however, and ended the day down 0.2% to $186.71. Analysts appeared focused on sales growth for the festival, which eased to 26% (from 27% in 2018), and marked the weakest expansion since the annual shopping blitz began in 2009.<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3519565-baba-files-500m-adr-offering">During the week, Alibaba also filed for a secondary listing in Hong Kong.</a></p>

      <p>The U.S. shale revolution will reshape global energy markets in the years to come, according to the IEA's annual World Energy Outlook. In fact, the country will account for 85% of the increase in global oil production to 2030, which will rise to 19M barrels a day and push down the share of the global oil market held by OPEC members and Russia to 47% (from 55% in the mid 2000s). "Countries whose economies are exclusively reliant on oil-and-gas reserves are facing serious challenges," said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director.</p>

      <p>New York's Department of Financial Services initiated a probe into the credit card practices of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS">GS</a>) following a series of tweets from David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails. He slammed the Apple Card (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL">AAPL</a>) for giving him 20x the credit limit than his wife - despite filing joint tax returns and his wife having a better credit score - and alleged that gender discrimination was present in algorithms that determined credit limits.

      <p>In his testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that the federal budget was on "an unsustainable path," and with the national debt now topping $23T, it could make it difficult for the economy to recover from future market downturns. According to the Treasury Department, the federal deficit reached $134B in October - the first month of fiscal 2020. The figure has spiked following the GOP tax law and multiple bipartisan agreements to increase spending on defense and domestic programs.<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305066-3-things-think-think-world-gone-mad">Cullen Roche asks if deficits will drive up interest rates.</a></p>

With a market capitalization now totaling $268B, the Mouse House is twice as valuable as Netflix (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX">NFLX</a>), which saw its market value tumble to about $124B amid slowing revenue growth and increasing competition. Important to note: Disney's increase was aided by its $71B acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets, which was completed in March.<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305531-netflix-dead-money">'Netflix Is Not Dead Money' writes Kwan-Chen Ma.</a></p>

      <p>Just weeks after beginning trial production of cars in China, Tesla (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA">TSLA</a>) announced the location of its second factory outside the USA: Berlin, Germany. The facility, to be named Gigafactory 4, will build batteries, powertrains and vehicles, "starting with the Model Y." Watching the news closely is Volkswagen (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWAGY">OTCPK:VWAGY</a>), as the new plant will be built in the automaker's backyard.

      <p>On an earnings call with qualified bondholders, WeWork (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WE">WE</a>) revealed the soaring net loss for the final quarter under Adam Neumann's leadership, according to slides viewed by <i>Axios</i>. The figure was up from $497M in last year's quarter, while its annual revenue run rate was up 25% Q/Q to nearly $4.2B. The loss came ahead of a bailout in October by Japan's SoftBank (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFTBY">OTCPK:SFTBY</a>), which gave WeWork a $3B investment after its plans fell through for an initial public offering.</p>

"I am confident it was conducted freely and fairly, without any type of outside influence," he told a news conference in Seoul. Filing a notice that the company will formally protest the result, Amazon Web Services' (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN">AMZN</a>) CEO Andy Jassy said politics got in the way and it would be hard to award a contract objectively when President Trump was disparaging Jeff Bezos.<br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305764-amazons-next-growth-driver-will-bigger-aws">'Amazon's Next Growth Driver Will Be Bigger Than AWS' writes Bluesea Research.</a></p>
