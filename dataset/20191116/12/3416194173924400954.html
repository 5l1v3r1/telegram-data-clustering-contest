      <p>Is <i><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/scream-queens/"><b>Scream Queens</b></a></i> coming back for a third season?!</p>
      <p>Fans are freaking out on social media after a <a href="https://twitter.com/drugrules/status/1195398569773162496?s=20">screenshot</a> of an article went around on Friday (November 15) confirming a new season is coming to Netflix, but the actual article is nowhere to be found anymore.</p>
      <p>The horror comedy series, starring <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/emma-roberts/"><b>Emma Roberts</b></a>, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/lea-michele/"><b>Lea Michele</b></a>, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/billie-lourd/"><b>Billie Lourd</b></a>, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/abigail-breslin/"><b>Abigail Breslin</b></a>, <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/keke-palmer/"><b>Keke Palmer</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/jamie-lee-curtis/"><b>Jamie Lee Curtis</b></a>, aired for two seasons on Fox before <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2017/05/15/scream-queens-will-not-get-a-third-season/">sadly being canceled</a> at the network. Earlier this year, there were <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2019/02/05/scream-queens-might-be-turned-into-a-movie/">rumors of a movie</a> version being in the works.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/ryan-murphy/"><b>Ryan Murphy</b></a>, one of the show’s creators, recently opened up about the possibility of the show making a return, and dished that most of the original cast is on board.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know. I would have to say that the answer to that lies in the studio who made it. Obviously I work for Netflix now, but if I could do anything to bring it back,” he told <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/american-horror-story-season-10-spoilers-ryan-murphy-ahs-1984-interview-season-finale-ratched-hollywood-streaming-dates-1202785704/">Deadline</a>. “<b>Emma</b> said she would do it, <b>Lea Michele</b> said she would do it, <b>Jamie Lee Curtis, Abigail Breslin, Billie Lourd</b> are all in. So it would depend if Fox wants to do it. I think we’d all do it. I think we’re waiting for them to call us. I know the show is very popular and had a real spike in popularity on Hulu.”</p>
      <p>“That was another one when we were making it; I don’t know if time has caught up to it, or it takes a while for people to get things, but yes, I’d be up for it,” he added. “The fans should write Fox and say they want this, Fox Studios and the network.”</p>
      <p><b>Emma </b>also got fans talking after she <a href="http://www.justjared.com/2019/11/14/emma-roberts-goes-back-to-blonde-after-wrapping-ahs-1984/">showed off her new hairdo</a>, which looks quite similar to Chanel Oberlin’s hair!</p>
      <p>No official word has been said yet, but we’re keeping our hopes up!</p>
