      <h1>Eoin Ó Broin: Housing is 'single biggest failure' of coalition Government</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:31:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/daniel-mcconnell/" target="_blank">By Daniel McConnell</a></address>
      <p>It is now almost €5,000 more a year to rent than when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil put together their confidence and supply arrangement, the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis has been told.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a live televised address, the party's housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin said the “single biggest failure of this Fine Gael / Fianna Fáil coalition government is housing”.</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Broin said that despite the creation of the Department of Housing and the appointment of a dedicated minister at senior Cabinet-level since 2016, the situation has worsened significantly.</p>
      <p>“Homelessness is up 67%. There are more than 10,000 people officially homeless according to the Department of Housing. Child Homelessness is up 81%. Tonight more than 4,000 children will sleep in hostels, hotels and HUBs,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Broin said some will spend their fourth Christmas this year in emergency accommodation.</p>
      <p>“Rents are up 39%. It is now almost €5,000 more a year to rent than when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil put together their confidence and supply arrangement. And house prices are up 20%. A whole generation of young people are now locked out of homeownership. This is Eoghan Murphy and Simon Coveney’s record,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Broin said his numbers are based on data from Daft.ie quarterly index of average rents which showed that in quarter 1 2016, rents were €998 and by the autumn of this year, the average rent was €1,403, a monthly increase of €404 or €4860 a year.</p>
      <p>Delegates heard that secure and affordable accommodation is increasingly out of reach of working people.</p>
      <p>He said things are not working because of an over-reliance on the private sector.</p>
      <p>“Their refusal to invest in public housing to meet social and affordable need lies at the heart of our crisis,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Broin said it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
      <blockquote>Public housing is the answer. We need a government that will double investment in public housing on public land; that will deliver affordable homes to buy at prices between €180,000 and €250,000; and that will deliver affordable cost rental homes at €700 to €900 per month.</blockquote>
      <p>In his address, the party's finance spokesman Pearse Doherty railed against the Insurance industry, accusing them of “wildly exaggerating” the number of fraudulent claims.</p>
      <p>He told delegates they “can’t be trusted” and Sinn Féin will “expose their lies.”</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin's vice-President Michelle O'Neill, who is facing a challenge to her position by way of a ballot due to be concluded this evening, repeated much of what she told delegates last night in attacking the British moves to provide an amnesty to “state forces.”</p>
      <p>She said the time for reunification is coming and demanded the Government prepare the ground for that.</p>
      <p>"We are entering a decade of opportunity where the freedom to choose our own future will be decided by the people of this island. "It is a time to transform our country, to unite the people who share this island, seizing what is the opportunity of a lifetime,” she told delegates.</p>
      <p>Her speech was criticised by former SDLP member and Labour senator, Mairia Cahill, for its similarities to the one she delivered on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“WHY is Michelle O'Neill giving exactly the same speech she gave last night to her Ard Fheis? Name of God,” Ms Cahill tweeted.</p>
