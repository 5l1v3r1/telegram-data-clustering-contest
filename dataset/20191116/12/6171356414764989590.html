      <p>Google is constantly A/B testing a plethora of changes in its products, and the company's Chrome browser is one of its biggest testing grounds. We've only recently compiled<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/17/15-tips-tricks-chrome-android-2019/"> a list of experimental features</a> tucked away behind flags or simply hidden from users. Soon, another might join this club, as it has just been discovered that Google's Android version of the browser has a long-press menu for the tab switcher in the works. It allows you to easily close the current tab or open another without entering Chrome's multitasking view.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-for-android-new-shortcut-tab-switcher-menu/">XDA Developers</a> managed to get the flag to show up through some tweaks, even though it's not user-accessible for anyone else yet. Once it's live, you will be able to activate the menu by heading to <i>chrome://flags</i> and searching for "tab switcher long-press menu." The feature itself is pretty self-explanatory: You will be able to perform actions such as opening a new (incognito) tab or closing the current one without entering the tab switcher itself, which could save you some precious milliseconds of your time.</p>

      <p>As of now, the feature isn't live in any official version of Chrome, be it the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.beta">Beta</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.dev">Dev</a>, or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.canary">Canary</a> channel. Since it already looks pretty complete, it's probably only a matter of time until the long-press flag makes its way into the earliest version, Canary. We'll update this post once we spot it.</p>

        <p>The feature made it into a stable release faster than expected. It is available in <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/01/chrome-beta-78-allows-sites-to-edit-local-files-read-verification-sms-texts-and-more/">Chrome version 78</a> by default — you shouldn't have to activate any flags to get it to work.</p>
        <p>End of Update</p>
