      <p>Ghanaian rap artiste, Okyeame Kwame has revealed the true story behind his new song, ‘Dum Fon No’ which features Yaa Yaa and it’s no other story than the one he encountered in his marriage in recent years.</p>
      <p>According to him, for four years, he and his family (children and wife) had to discuss the wife’s attachment to her phone instead of offering companionship to him and the kids.</p>
      <p>Okyeame who was speaking in an interview with Jessica Opara Saforo on Citi FM noted that his wife at some point in time was always on the phone making it difficult for the children to get through to her.</p>
      <p>When was asked if he has ever been at the point where he wanted to walk away from the marriage, he said not to the point of walking away but rather chose to tackle phubbing (the practice of ignoring one’s companion in order to pay attention to one’s phone) because it has over the years become the number one reason for most problems in relationships in the world.</p>
      <p><i><b>“For four years we used to discuss. My children found it very difficult to get through to her because she was always on the phone. She says I’m doing research, I have to do a presentation. That’s for like four years and it got to a point that I got tired,”</b></i> he said.</p>
      <p><i><b>“Not walking away but it gets to a point where you wanna cheat cos you want to get to a place where you’ll be pampered, you’ll be given the attention, find this young Legon student to kiss your feet and tell you lies and take your money and go with you to the club. It gets to a point where it gets boring. Those things happen. Not like walk away”</b></i> he explained.</p>
