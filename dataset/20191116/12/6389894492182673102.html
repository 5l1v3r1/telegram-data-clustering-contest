      <p>The US markets regulator will undertake an inquiry into Wework’s failed attempt to float on the New York Stock Exchange this summer.</p>
      <p>The office space company will be scrutinised by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine whether it broke the law as it went ahead with a public listing, reports claim.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Wework’s finances will be reviewed following a number of reports that suggested there were questionable accounting practices in place as well as possible conflicts of interest, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/wework-is-said-to-face-sec-inquiry-into-possible-rule-violations">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>Weeks before the loss-making firm’s planned IPO, it was forced to convince the SEC that its unconventional accounting metric was legitimate; the company claims its “community-adjusted Ebitda” is a snapshot of the profitability of each individual WeWork building.</p>
      <p>Questions have also been raised over the role of former chief executive Adam Nuemann, who owns a stake in buildings leased back to Wework.</p>
      <p>More concerns were raised when it was revealed Neumann’s wife Rebekah was one of three people responsible of picking a new chief executive due to the unusual rules in place at the firm.</p>

      <p>Wework had hoped to secure a valuation on the stock market even higher than the £36bn suggested privately, but cancelled the public offering after repeatedly having to scale back its valuation.</p>
      <p>The company this week told investors it lost $1.3bn in the last three months.</p>
      <p>The SEC declined to comment on the inquiry.</p>
