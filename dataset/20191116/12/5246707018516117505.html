      <p>So, if you haven't already noticed during your own playthrough of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b>, the psychic-water type Slowpoke isn't <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/galarpokedex.shtml">featured</a> in the Galar Region's Pokédex.</p>
      <p>While it was believed this Pokémon had been removed, that's not <i>entirely</i> true. You see, the new curry recipes in Sword and Shield reveal Slowpoke actually appears as a cooking ingredient within this region. Yep, people located in Galar like to eat Pokémon.</p>
      <p>There's a bagged treat referred to as Smoke-Poké Tail – commonly known as a Slowpoke's tail – according to a description in the game. On the plus side, the tail at least grows back.</p>
      <blockquote>One of the many ingredients that can be used for cooking at your camp. When a Slowpoke’s tail falls off, it grows back quickly.</blockquote>

      <p>When <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-video/2019/10/02/101-rapid-fire-questions-about-pokemon-sword-and-shield">Game Informer</a> originally asked Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori if people in Galar were making sausages out of Pokémon, he replied saying he didn't know what was in them. This latest finding, however, confirms people in this region are indeed cooking up Pokémon.</p>
      <p>It wouldn't be the first time a discovery like this has been made, either. An <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2018/9/28/17914112/what-do-pokemon-eat-food-humans">investigation</a> last year found people within this universe also consume Pokémon byproducts, such as Miltank milk and Chansey eggs. Earlier entries in the series have also cited pocket monsters as "delicious" meals.</p>
