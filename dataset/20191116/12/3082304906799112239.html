        <b>The latest word around the rumour mill is that RB Salzburg’s Erling Braut Haaland – who has emerged as a key target for Manchester United in recent times – has apparently sent text messages to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer enquiring about the club ahead of a potential move.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205230/Erling-Haaland-text-messages-Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer-Man-Utd-transfer-talk"><i>Express</i></a> that reports that Haaland has been in contact with Solskjaer, even as talks of a transfer move are gaining pace.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Saturday, it was claimed that Manchester United will sign the 19-year-old in January, but will loan him back to RB Salzburg until the end of the ongoing 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>In case you did not know, Solskjaer and Haaland have already worked with each other at Norwegian club Molde – and it was the 46-year-old former United forward who handed the young striker his first senior debut at the club.</p>
      <p>And earlier this year Haaland had revealed that he had been speaking to him about the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>“I was working almost two years under him and I have a lot of good memories,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“Especially for young players, he was a perfect coach. Because he was an excellent striker, he taught me a lot of things.</p>
      <p>“Even now we are texting sometimes and I am happy about his success with Man United. I wish him all the best for the future.”</p>
