      <p>Street performers, fireworks and a festive market will all be on offer in West Bridgford next weekend as the town's Christmas Lights Switch-On takes place.</p>
      <p>Councillor Christine Jeffreys, Mayor of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/west-bridgford">West Bridgford</a> , will turn on the lights during the event on Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>Bridgford Road, Central Avenue and Gordon Road will all be illuminated by the lights until January.</p>
      <p>Councillor Jeffreys said: "Such events are a great opportunity to showcase everything our local economy has to offer and we as a council are keen to promote the successful businesses across Rushcliffe at this busy time of year.</p>
      <p>â€œI would encourage everyone to come along and support their local businesses and traders for this fabulous start to the festive season."</p>
      <p>The switch-on itself will take place at 5pm but there will be lots of festivities taking place throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Seasonal entertainment will be on offer from 10am with performers, local singers and a Christmas market on the croquet lawn. Stalls will also be set up by young entrepreneurs in Gordon Road from 12noon.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, children and their parents can meet Santa Claus at his Gordon Road grotto from 12.30-2pm and 3-4pm, while a Frozen-themed snowflake trail will also happen at 4pm.</p>
      <p>A fireworks display will follow the switch-on.</p>
