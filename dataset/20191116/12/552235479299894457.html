      <h2>It's the first game of Scotland's Euro 2020 double header as Steve Clarke's side look to build some momentum.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:31:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland are in Cyprus for what is essentially a dead rubber yet <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> needs a result as much as ever.</p>
      <p>The national side are in Nicosia for the second last of their Euro 2020 qualifying group fixtures before Tuesday's match with Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>And with the crucial <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> playoff match in March on the horizon, six points from six is a must if they are to build any momentum after a disappointing spell since Clarke took over.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> ran out 2-1 winners thanks to a late <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/oliver-burke">Oliver Burke</a> goal in the first meeting between these two sides, but a trip to Cyprus is a different proposition for Clarke's men after their recent woes away from home.</p>
      <p>Here's all the details you need to know ahead of the clash.</p>
