      <h1>ONE Championship: Ilias Ennahachi, Roman Kryklya leave Beijing with Super Series Kickboxing titles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T12:53:09+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Carroll</a></address>
      <p>Ilias Ennahachi successfully defended his Super Series flyweight kickboxing title in the main event of ONE Championship: Age of Dragons on Saturday in Beijing, China with a unanimous decision win over Wenfeng Wang.</p>
      <p>Buoyed by his home support, Wang waded into the exchanges in the final two rounds, but the Dutch fighter had likely already made an impact on the judges’ scoring card with his pinpoint striking from a multitude of angles over the opening three rounds.</p>
      <p>“This was not my best fight, but sometimes you have a good fight…the best fight…but this time I still won the fight,” the champion said following his victory.</p>
      <p>In the co-main event, Roman Kryklya claimed the ONE Super Series light heavyweight kickboxing world title after surviving an early storm from opponent Tarik Khbabez. As soon as the second round started, Kryklya prompted the referee to get involved twice as he unloaded on his smaller counterpart. After the second pause in action, the towering Ukrainian could taste blood and forced the stoppage with a hard-hitting flurry on the restart.</p>
