      <p>At E3 2018 The Coalition took to the Microsoft conference stage to announce a new spin-off set in the Gears of War universe. That game is Gears Tactics which is a strategy game similar to the recent XCOM titles in which players control units and move them around battlegrounds. The game is being developed with Splash Damage. Since its reveal and teaser, however, there has been very little news on what is going on with the title.</p>

      <p>Gears: Tactics is set 12 years before the events of the first Gears of War title with the squad tasked with hunting down the Locust monster maker which has led to the destruction of entire cities. Alongside Gears: Tactics another title, Ori and the Will of the Wisps will also be shown.</p>
