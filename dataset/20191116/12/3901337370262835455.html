      <p>Ernst Middendorp says that they’ve already started preparing for the TKO semifinal against Maritzburg United at the end of the month after the international break, insisting that they aren’t getting carried away with their current run of form – their best in five years.</p>
      <p>The German coach acknowledged the importance of their 3-2 Soweto Derby win over the Buccaneers over the weekend and spoke of how happy it had made fans across the country, but has now called for them to refocus on the task at hand.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website this week, Middendorp said, “It is a matter of goal-setting. There’s a Telkom Knockout semifinal match coming up, this is the time to set goals for the next target. We are not carried away. We want to reach the final. Already now we’ve started preparing. But, let the players celebrate and rest for the moment and get back to focus.</p>
      <p>“The players know what is at stake – especially the local guys, (who) have a role to get the new guys into the groove. The players must help the new players to understand the meaning of the Soweto Derby, the meaning of this win and how to handle it. The mood is fantastic, and I think it is really underestimated how much this win means to Chiefs. It is so beautiful to witness the happiness and the mood in the streets.”</p>
