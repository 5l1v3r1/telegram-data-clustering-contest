        <b>ELDORET, Kenya, Nov 16 – The newborn unit at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH)  has received Sh10 million worth of equipment which is expected to boost service delivery at the facility.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The equipment provided by the Safaricom Foundation includes infant incubators, phototherapy machines and cardiac monitors which will be used in the wards and the Intensive Care Unit.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>According to the foundation’s Trustee Rita Okuthe, the initiative will increase the capacity of the unit which is expected to offer treatment to more than 100 infants.</p>
      <p>“Safaricom Foundation’s efforts to enable access to maternal healthcare does not only concern women but also infants. Our children’s future can be secured by providing quality healthcare right at the beginning of their lives to prevent infant mortality,” she said on Friday.</p>
      <p>At Moiben Sub-County Hospital, Safaricom Foundation equipped the maternity wing with ward beds, delivery beds, furniture, and assorted maternity equipment worth Sh5 million.</p>
      <p>A beneficiary from the sub-county, Jackline Nafula, hailed the project and stated that the unit has greatly benefited her.</p>
      <p>“The equipment has helped us reduce costs as women it has also helped, as we give birth there will be no complications like before,” Nafula said.</p>
      <p>The program which was launched in Lamu last has set aside Sh132 million for three years to promote maternal, newborn and child health services around the country.</p>
      <p>So far, the Safaricom Foundation has opened a newborn unit at Faza sub-county hospital and maternal shelter in Witu, both in Lamu County and in July last year, partnered with Mombasa County to equip the Maternal High Dependency Unit at the Coast Provincial General Hospital.</p>
