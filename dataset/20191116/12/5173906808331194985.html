        <b>The Municipality of Lagos has once again submitted an application for the ECOXXI environmental award and was represented at the awards ceremony in Lousã.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lagos brought home the Green Flag 2019, as well as the best score ever obtained in this sustainability ranking (70.21 points), which allowed it to rise to a higher level, that of municipalities with an index between 70 and 80 percent.</p>
      <p>Lagos was one of the four Algarve municipalities that submitted an application, obtaining the best sustainability index at regional level, in an edition in which 53 municipalities competed at national level.</p>
      <p>The indicators with the best performance were those related to “Implementation of the Blue Flag Programme”, “Information available to residents”, “Management Systems Certification”, “Classified Areas” (nature conservation)” and the component “Sustainable Tourism”.</p>
      <p>As a good practice, the Municipality presented the Coastal Requalification carried out in Ponta da Piedade, a natural monument and unique tourist resource for the natural, historical and cultural values ??present.</p>
      <p>For 2020, the municipality services are already planning a set of actions to embody the news and new challenges launched by the ECOXXI Programme, namely Eco-employees – which foresees environmental education and sensitisation actions directed in particular to municipal workers, Protective measures to reverse erosion, compaction and waterproofing, soil removal and contamination trends and a new indicator that aims to assess the adoption strategies, the existence of action plans and the level of implementation of these measures.</p>
      <p>It will also continue two projects that will have new dynamics in 2020, such as "The Sea Begins Here" and the "Council Action for Climate Action", to dynamise in partnership with schools.</p>
      <p>The ECOXXI programme is an initiative of the Blue Flag Association of Europe which seeks to encourage and recognize the growing concern of decision makers about policies that will enhance the sustainability of their territories and the quality of life of their populations.</p>
