      <h1>Trump revives year-old insult for House Intel Chair Adam ‘Schitt’</h1>

      <p>The president recycled an insult against the congressman leading the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-marie-yovanovitchs-testimony/">impeachment inquiry</a> Saturday morning, sprinkling a little profanity into a tweet about the economy.</p>
      <p>“Dow hits 28,000 – FIRST TIME EVER, HIGHEST EVER!” President Donald Trump tweeted. “Gee, Pelosi &amp; Schitt have a good idea, ‘lets Impeach the President.’ If something like that ever happened, it would lead to the biggest FALL in Market History. It’s called a Depression, not a Recession! So much for 401-K’s &amp; Jobs!” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195722806274736129">the president tweeted.</a></p>
      <p>He was referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Democrat Adam Schiff, who as chair of the Intelligence Committee led the public hearings in the impeachment inquiry this week.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/18/trump-attacks-adam-schiff-as-little-adam-schitt-in-tweet/">previously used the epithet</a> to refer to Schiff a year ago.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones industrial average crossed 28,000<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/dow-hits-all-time-high-on-china-trade-deal-hopes/"> for the first time</a> Friday, closing at an all-time high of 28,004.89, after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the US and China were “getting close” on a trade pact.</p>
