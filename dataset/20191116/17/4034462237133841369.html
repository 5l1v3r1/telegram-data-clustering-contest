      <h1>Don't Expect Any New Ferrari Models Next Year</h1>
      <h2>For once, Ferrari is slowing things down.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:30:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>In case you haven't been paying attention, Ferrari has released five all-new models in 2019. The two most recent reveals include the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ferrari/roma">Roma</a> Gran Tourer and the hybrid <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ferrari/sf90-stradale">SF90 Stradale</a>, each of which serves a very different purpose in the company's lineup. Ferrari says it plans to reveal 15 new models within a five-year window. So that leaves ten more vehicles including the upcoming <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ferrari/purosangue">Purosangue</a> SUV.</p>
      <p>But unlike 2019, 2020 will not be a landmark year for Ferrari reveals. Speaking to <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ferrari-slow-range-expansion-2020">Autocar,</a> Ferrari commercial chief Enrico Galliera said, "We've committed to introducing 15 new models in a five-year plan, and we launched five in 2019, so certainly something will happen in the future. But 2020 for us is a year of consolidation."</p>

      <p>"We just introduced five new cars, some of them are in new segments; now we need to make sure that our network and clients can clearly understand the position of the new models. 2020 will not have the same launch rate, and we'll be more focused on creating the success of the models we've introduced in 2019," he added. This is not a clear indication that 2020 will be completely devoid of new Ferrari reveals but we certainly won't see as many as five.</p>
      <p>With fewer reveals in 2020, it should give Ferrari customers (and dealerships) more time to become familiar with the new models and figure out how they slot it with the existing product. Roma, as an example, feels like it will slot in slightly above the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ferrari/portofino">Portofino </a>but Ferrari has been very tight-lipped on exactly where the car will sit in the range.</p>

      <p>As for future hybridization, we know Ferrari is working on new ways to incorporate battery technology, as we've seen recently on the SF90. When asked if Ferrari would introduce hybrid versions to existing models like the new Roma, Galliera said, "We could fit a hybrid powertrain to [the Roma] platform, there's no doubt about it. But we would never do it on the same model." Therefore, when we do start to see more hybrid vehicles from Ferrari, they will likely be all-new models not new versions of existing products.</p>
