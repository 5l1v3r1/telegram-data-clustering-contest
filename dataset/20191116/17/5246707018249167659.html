      <p>This week at London's Bloomsbury Big Top, the results of the 37th Golden Joystick Awards were revealed. More than 3.5 million public votes were cast to determine the winners across 19 categories.</p>
      <p>On the Switch front, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> took out the Nintendo game of the year. Perhaps more impressively, was when House House – the Australian-based developer who created the charming and humorous <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/untitled_goose_game">Untitled Goose Game</a></b> – received the Breakthrough Award. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/au/untitled-goose-game-breakthrough-golden-joystick-2019/">Via GamesRadar</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The award recognises a studio, developer, or person in the industry who has had a year to remember. House House — whose previous game Push Me, Pull You was released in 2016 — clinched the award thanks to the enduring popularity of its stealth puzzle gem, Untitled Goose Game.</blockquote>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a></b> won the 'Still Playing Award' and Epic's battle royale <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">Fortnite</a></b> won eSports game of the year. Epic Games also won the studio of the year award.</p>
      <p>The former head of Sega AM2 Yu Suzuki – who worked on many of the company's arcade titles over the years – was recognised with a lifetime achievement award, and the ultimate game of the year went to Capcom's <b>Resident Evil 2</b> remake, available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.</p>
