      <h1>New Motorola Razr European pricing revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:03:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>The new folding <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/motorola-razr-uk-pricing-and-availability/">Motorola Razr is coming to Europe</a>, but so far we have not heard what the Motorola Razr price in Europe will be.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/opvouwbare-telefoons/motorola-razr-kopen-prijs/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">LetsGoDigital reports</a> that the unlocked price in Sweden has been announced, and it is not cheap.</p>
      <p>According to their report, the handset will be retailing there for € 1,680 ($1863). The Motorola Razr price in Europe presumably includes tax, meaning it will vary slightly around Europe, but due to the single market buyers should be able to shop around for the lowest price.</p>
      <p>The new Razr is constructed of premium stainless steel and 3D Gorilla Glass, and features a dark design which emphasizes its sleek lines.</p>
      <p>It features a zero-gap hinge that allows both sides of the customized polymer flexible display system to remain perfectly flush when closed and protects the display from debris and dust; and a re-engineered antenna’s to fit in a space twice as small as today’s smartphones; and is, therefore, water-resistant and splash-proof.</p>
      <p>Inside is a 6.2-inch Flex View display with 21:9 aspect ratio which folds up to fit in your pocket easily.</p>
      <p>On the outside is an external 2.7-inch interactive Quick View display which provides only the important information on the go, making it easy to stay connected while remaining present in the moment. You can make calls, reply to messages, pay with a tap, control your music, take selfies, use Google assistant and access customized settings, like turning on or off Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, your Hotspot and more, all without ever opening your phone.</p>
