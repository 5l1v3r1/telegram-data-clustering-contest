        <b>Are you excited for <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/you-can-now-sign-up-for-the-technical-alpha-of-microsoft-flight-simulator/">the upcoming release of Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> in 2020? Do you own Microsoft Flight Simulator X on Steam? If you answered yes to at least the second question, then good news! You can now participate in a fresh new beta.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Microsoft Flight Simulator X has released a new beta branch in order to gain new telemetry data that’ll help in the development of Flight Simulator 2020.</p>
      <p>It’s completely free to participate in the beta if you already own the game and, if you don’t own the game but you’re interested, you can always pick yourself up a copy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/314160/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_X_Steam_Edition/">on Steam here for $24.99/£19.99</a>.</p>
      <p>Just remember that Microsoft Flight Simulator X is <i>not</i> the upcoming game – it’s the 2014 Steam version of the 2006 game – but if you want to register for the upcoming game’s technical alpha, you can do by following the steps in <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/september-12th-2019-development-update/">the blog post here</a>. You can also just admire the announcement trailer below.</p>

      <p>If you own Microsoft Flight Simulator X, simply follow the steps below in order to opt into the beta. You can also opt out at any time.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch Steam and head over to your Library.</li>
        <li>Right click on FSX: Steam Edition.</li>
        <li>Select Properties.</li>
        <li>Select the “BETA” tab.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Choose “fsx-beta External Beta” branch.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Note: No code is required to get into the beta! You can just ignore the box requesting one.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Select “yes” when asked if you allow telemetry.</li>
        <li>Restart your Steam Client.</li>
        <li>Success!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you want to opt out of the beta and return to the game’s live build, just follow the steps above and select “branch – NONE” instead. Remember to restart your Steam Client when done.</p>
