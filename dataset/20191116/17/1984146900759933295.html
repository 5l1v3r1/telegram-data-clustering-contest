      <h1>How Sunderland's League One rivals got on, ex-Black Cats in dramatic late winner</h1>
      <h2>Phil Parkinson's side weren't in action due to international call-ups, but there was plenty of League One action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:29:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">chroniclelive.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Bolton have wiped out their points deduction after Daryl Murphy's stoppage-time winner saw off 10-man MK Dons 1-0.</p>
      <p>A third straight win for Wanderers - who started the campaign on -12 points after going into administration - moved them on to one point for the campaign and 12 behind their third-bottom opponents in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/efl-league-one">Sky Bet League One.</a></p>
      <p>MK Dons appeared to have done enough to stop their three-match losing run when goalkeeper Lee Nicholls saved Murphy's 90th-minute penalty.</p>
      <p>But three minutes into added time, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/daryl-murphy">Murphy</a> turned in Thibaud Verlinden's cross.</p>
      <p>MK Dons had been reduced to 10 men with 24 minutes left when George Williams was adjudged to have swung an arm at Verlinden.</p>
      <p>Liam Walsh's stunning individual effort saw Coventry come from behind to beat Rochdale 2-1 and go third in the table.</p>
      <p>Walsh picked up the ball on the halfway line before dribbling past three players on the edge of the box before beating Robert Sanchez at his near post.</p>

      <p>Rochdale, who had lost their last three league games, stunned St Andrew's when Ian Henderson swept home Callum Camps' cross in the 28th minute.</p>
      <p>But the hosts were on level terms just before half-time when Jordan Shipley finished off at the second attempt after being played in by Zain Westbrooke - before Walsh finally made the Sky Blues' pressure count in the 72nd minute.</p>
      <p>Blackpool moved up to fifth after seeing off a battling AFC Wimbledon 2-0.</p>
      <p>Armand Gnanduillet broke the deadlock in the 51st minute and added a second with nine minutes left to secure his side a fourth straight win in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Rotherham also took advantage of the international break to move into the top six after they edged past Accrington 1-0.</p>
      <p>The hosts' early pressure finally told in the 30th minute when Carlton Morris headed home Ben Wiles' free-kick.</p>
      <p>But the Millers were forced to hang on after Chiedozie Ogbene was given a second booking with eight minutes left.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Lincoln continued to struggle following September's departure of Danny Cowley as they went down 1-0 at Gillingham.</p>
      <p>Mikael Mandron's 24th-minute strike settled the game, leaving the Imps with just one win in 10 league games since Cowley moved to Huddersfield.</p>
      <p>The results mean <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> drop to ninth place in the division, with Rotherham and Blackpool moving ahead.</p>
      <p>Phil Parkinson's side have games in hand over many of the sides around them, however, and are only four points from Saturday's opponents Coventry in third place.</p>
