        <i>Toppling of Bolivian president reignites movement to remove leftist ally Nicolás Maduro</i>
      </p>
      <p>Venezuela’s flagging opposition movement has hit the streets for its first major protests in months, as leaders sought to reignite their campaign to force <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> from power after his leftist ally Evo Morales was toppled in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>Thousands of protesters took to the streets on Saturday morning in towns and cities across the crisis-stricken south American country, hoping <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/evo-morales-indigenous-leader-who-changed-bolivia-but-stayed-too-long">the dramatic sea</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/evo-morales-indigenous-leader-who-changed-bolivia-but-stayed-too-long"> change in Bolivian politics</a> might portend similar change in Venezuela.</p>
      <p>“The whole of Venezuela awakes,” the movement’s young leader Juan Guaidó said in <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1195689597029814272?s=20">a Twitter message</a> to demonstrators who had gathered in cities including Maracaibo, <a href="https://twitter.com/Presidencia_VE/status/1195718162651762688?s=20">Barquisimeto</a> and the capital, Caracas.</p>
      <p>Maduro supporters staged a rival demonstration in Caracas to denounce what organisers called “US coup-mongering in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia">Bolivia</a> and Venezuela”.</p>

      <p>Anti-Maduro demonstrators chanted “Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!” as they processed through Caracas carrying their country’s yellow, red and blue tricolor flag.</p>
      <p>“The dictatorship is mistaken if it thinks we are afraid,” Hayber Farias, a youth leader from Guaidó’s party, <a href="https://twitter.com/HayberF/status/1195712106768687104?s=20">said</a> as he joined the demonstration.</p>
      <p>Guaidó lead supporters to the Bolivian embassy in Caracas and <a href="https://twitter.com/VPITV/status/1195764649922351104?s=20">insisted</a>: “I don’t know if it will be today, tomorrow or Monday. But what I can guarantee you .... is that we will have freedom in all of Venezuela.”</p>
      <p>But Guaidó’s campaign has lost steam since the start of this year when Maduro’s downfall seemed to many a matter of time and Saturday’s marches appeared far smaller than the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/02/venezuelans-take-to-streets-in-push-to-force-maduro-from-power">massive mobili</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/02/venezuelans-take-to-streets-in-push-to-force-maduro-from-power">sations</a> that rocked Venezuela in January, February and March.</p>
      <p>One veteran of those protests said they had decided to stay at home on Saturday: “It sounded pointless.”</p>
      <p>Since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/01/venezuela-crisis-maduro-claims-victory-over-deranged-us-backed-coup-attempt">Guaidó’s failed attempt to spark an uprising</a> on 30 April momentum has ebbed away from his movement and international attention – and support – has fallen away.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/28/argentina-election-macri-out-as-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-returns-to-office-as-vp">The left’s recent return to power in Argentina</a> robbed Venezuela’s opposition of one important regional ally, Mauricio Macri, although Guaidó continues to enjoy the backing of Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, Colombia’s Iván Duque, as well as the US and European powers such as the UK and Germany.</p>
      <p>Many key members of Venezuela’s opposition have also been forced to flee into exile amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/09/venezuela-maduro-guaido-crackdown-edgar-zambrano">a crackdown</a> that began after the botched attempt to bring Maduro down on 30 April.</p>
      <p>Raúl Gallegos, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a> specialist from the Control Risks consultancy, said Saturday’s demonstrations were designed to signal both at home and abroad that Guaidó’s crusade against Maduro was “alive and well”.</p>
      <p>“Everything that is happening in Latin America has made it very clear that Venezuela has lost its pre-eminence in the news cycle. And with the departure of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/evo-morales">Evo Morales</a> they are trying to take advantage of that momentum and say: ‘Maybe we are the next Bolivia.’”</p>
      <p>Gallegos said that kind of rapid change seemed improbable in Venezuela – but with its economy in ruins and international pressure unlikely to ease in the immediate future, the situation remained unpredictable.</p>
      <p>“When a regime is holding on through fear and intimidation … it entails a number of risks and vulnerabilities for those in power. So the idea that this is over – I wouldn’t be so quick to call it that way,” Gallegos added.</p>
      <p>“It’s still a climate that lends itself to unexpected events that could lead to a successful coup or the emergence of a new type of leadership within the opposition … that could be much more radical in its approach towards the government.”</p>
