      <h1>NFL Insider Has Telling Update On Colin Kaepernick Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:45:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has a workout in front of at least 25 NFL teams this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The NFL announced the workout earlier this week, much to the surprise of fans and even NFL teams.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the news came out, fans suggested it was a publicity stunt given the timing. Placing the workout on a Saturday gives NFL general managers and coaches no chance to attend.</p>
      <p>However, the latest report from NFL insider Steve Wyche suggests there will be legitimate decision-makers at the workout.</p>
      <p>“Even though there are not expected to be GMs or head coaches here, it is going to be primarily pro personnel directors and heads of pro scouting departments, some of whom are considered to be in the general manager pipeline,” Wyche reported via Ian Rapoport.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick, who last played in the NFL in 2016, is expected to throw for scouts and then interview with teams.</p>
      <p>The workout will reportedly take place in three phases. The first is a preliminary workout, with measurables – much like the NFL combine. He’ll then throw to receivers before finally meeting with teams.</p>
      <p>Will Kaepernick wow scouts and earn a spot back on an NFL roster?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
