      <p>The injury is not related to the knee surgery he underwent last December.</p>
      <p>Juolevi’s 2018-19 campaign with Utica was cut short after 18 games, during which he collected 13 points, because of the injury.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old was selected by the Canucks with the fifth pick in the 2016 NHL Draft.</p>
      <p>He has recorded five assists in 14 games with the Comets this season.</p>
