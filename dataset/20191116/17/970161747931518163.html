      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>’s India Reynolds has been met with a string of trolls over her spelling of Dubai.</p>
      <p>The model – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/26/love-islands-ovie-soko-india-reynolds-split-months-leaving-villa-amid-cheat-claims-10988279/">who recently split from </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ovie-soko/">Ovie Soko</a> – has been living her best life out in Dubai, and took a second to bless us with a snap of herself on the beach.</p>
      <p>Alongside the stunning upload – of the 28-year-old posing in a black bikini with skyscrapers behind her – she told her 1.1million followers: ‘In love with Dubae @fivepalmjumeirah.’</p>
      <p>And, while we giggled at her pun, some didn’t quite get the joke, sliding in to claim she had spelled the country wrong.</p>
      <p>Yes, seriously.</p>
      <p>‘It’s Dubai learn how to spell,’ one helpful person commented, while another wrote: ‘Imagine flying all the way there and can’t even spell it kmt.’</p>
      <p>‘Should probably learn how to spell it then…..,’ a follower suggested.</p>

      <p>Having absolutely none of it, the ITV2 star then took to her Instagram story, insisting that she actually knows how to spell correctly.</p>

      <p>‘Shall we all calm down…,’ India began. ‘I know how to spell “Dubai”.</p>
      <p>‘It clearly wasn’t all that punny… but it gets like that sometimes.’</p>
      <p>Well we thought she showed great pun-tential…</p>
      <p>Yeah, we’ll leave the puns to the expert.</p>

      <p>India recently made headlines after she confirmed her split from Ovie Soko, just months after they met in the Love Island villa.</p>
      <p>The pair ended the show in third place, but went their separate ways at the end of October.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/27/love-islands-india-reynolds-breaks-silence-ovie-soko-split-free-kind-10990682/">she appeared to hit back at negative comments</a> she received since their break-up, urging people to think before they comment on things.</p>
      <p>Alluding to the romance, she posted: ‘It’s free to be kind… Think before you type… Thank you x.’</p>
      <p>It seems some of her followers didn’t quite get the memo…</p>
