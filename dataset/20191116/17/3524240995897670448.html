      <p>Leke Baiyewu, Abuja</p>
      <p>The House of Representatives has begun an investigation of the Nigerian Air Force helicopter crash on Thursday in the NAF Base in Enugu State.</p>
      <p>The House Committee on Air Force has, therefore, invited the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, for questioning over the incident.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the committee, Mr Shehu Koko, in a statement on Saturday, described the crash as unfortunate and an ugly incident. He thanked God that no life was lost while saying that the House was determined to investigate the remote cause of the incident to avoid future reoccurrence.</p>
      <p>The training helicopter had crashed after returning from a routine training exercise.</p>
      <p>According to the NAF Twitter account, the crash occurred on Thursday after routine training. It said that although there were casualties, the cause of the incident was still sketchy and unknown.</p>
      <p>Koko in the statement, however, said, “The House Committee on Air Force, upon hearing of the sad incident that occurred on the 14th of November, involving a training Nigerian Air Force helicopter crash in Enugu State wishes to thank God that no life was lost.</p>
      <p>“However, the House Committee on Air Force is disturbed that such incident occurred at a time when the Air Force had assured the parliament and the nation that the force was fully prepared to take on insecurity head-on and bring an end to it, in collaboration with other sister agencies.</p>
      <p>“The committee, which has pledged its full support under the leadership of the Speaker, Rt. Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, is deeply saddened about this unfortunate situation.</p>
      <p>“We, therefore, invite the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar to brief the committee on the immediate and remote causes of the crash. The date for the interface shall be communicated through the Secretariat in due course.”</p>
