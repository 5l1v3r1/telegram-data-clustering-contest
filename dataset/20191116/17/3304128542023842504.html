      <p>Bodies of Army Major Peter Mugure’s Wife and kids have been discovered in a shallow grave within Thingithu Estate in Nanyuki.</p>
      <p>Police found Joyce Syombua, her two children Shanice Maua and Prince Michael after the suspect led them to the grave.</p>
      <p>The three went missing on October 26 following a visit to Mugure who is based at the Laikipia Airbase.</p>
      <p>Joyce’s mother, Elizabeth Maua filed a missing persons report at Soweto Police Station as did her friend Farizana at a Nanyuki police station.</p>

      <p>Mugure was only arrested on Friday after which he told the police that he dropped the deceased persons off to catch a matatu back to Nairobi.</p>
      <p>However, reports from the wife’s friend indicate that they did not return after they were taken from home in the morning for a tour of the base.</p>
      <p>Joyce’s phone was on Sunday found in a 4NTE Sacco matatu that was headed to Naivasha.</p>
