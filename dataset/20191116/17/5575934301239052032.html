      <p>The thing about life milestones, and even life transitions, is that it often takes a bit of money to make them happen.</p>
      <p>That’s something many millennials don’t have a lot of. They’re still <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/millennial-generation-gap-great-recession-financial-crisis-money-habits-2019-3">playing financial catch-up from the Great Recession</a> while dealing with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/student-loan-debt-crisis-college-cost-mind-blowing-facts-2019-7">enormous student-loan debt</a> and facing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/millennials-last-graduating-class-affordability-crisis-student-loans-housing-2019-5">skyrocketing living costs</a>.</p>
      <p>And findings from a new survey by Insider and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/10/10/the-toll-of-student-debt-goes-beyond-failing-to-build-wealth/">Morning Consult</a> further highlight what a different financial world this is for them than it was for their parents.</p>
      <p>The survey polled 2,096 Americans about their financial health, debt, and earnings for a new series, “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/the-state-of-our-money">The State of Our Money</a>.” More than 670 respondents were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/millennials-gen-x-money-stresses-retirement-savings-2019-10">millennials</a>, defined as ages 23 to 38 in 2019; 730 respondents were <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/generations-and-age/">baby boomers</a>, defined as ages 55 to 73 in 2019.</p>
      <p>It asked all respondents what life events they have delayed because of money concerns, and the differences between millennials and baby boomers were telling.</p>

      <h3>Millennials are more likely to delay pretty much everything thanks to money problems</h3>
      <p>The biggest difference is in homebuying: Half of millennials have delayed purchasing a house because they can’t afford it, compared to 23% of boomers. It makes sense considering the median price of home sales has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/income-increase-young-adults-less-than-housing-tuition-costs-2019-9">increased by 39%</a> since 1970, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent <a href="https://www.supermoney.com/average-millennial-income/">SuperMoney report</a> that analysed US Federal Housing Agency Data.</p>
      <p>About the same percentage of millennials have put off having a medical procedure, compared to 41% of baby boomers. It’s the closest gap between the two generations, if that shows how expensive healthcare is. National health care costs per person have <a href="https://www.supermoney.com/average-millennial-income/">increased by $US9,000 since 1970</a> in inflation-adjusted dollars.</p>
      <p>Millennials are also twice as likely as boomers to have delayed career moves because of money concerns, including quitting a job and starting their own business.</p>
      <p>There’s also the effect money has had on each generation’s love lives. It’s made millennials more likely to delay beginning and ending a relationship, as well as more likely to delay marriage. In 2017, the average age of a first marriage was <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/marital.html">27 for women and 29 for men</a>; in 1980, it was 22 and 25, respectively.</p>
      <p>A delay in marriage can trickle down to a delay in childbearing. More 30-something women are having babies than women in their 20s for the first time ever – a difference that grew in 2018,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/15/723518379/u-s-births-fell-to-a-32-year-low-in-2018-cdc-says-birthrate-is-at-record-level">Bill Chappell for NPR reported</a>, citing a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr-007-508.pdf">report</a> from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>Again, it boils down to money: Finances are one of the top reasons why American millennials aren’t having kids or are having fewer kids than they considered ideal, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/kids-expensive-americans-having-fewer-2018-7">Business Insider’s Shana Lebowitz reported</a>, citing a survey by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/upshot/americans-are-having-fewer-babies-they-told-us-why.html?mabReward=CTS2&amp;amp;recid=16xjRCOVcZJ1dqGX8Oj38JKgmMk&amp;amp;recp=4">The New York Times</a>.</p>
      <p>But there is one thing millennials are doing better than their parents when it comes to money: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/millennials-more-open-discussing-money-finances-than-boomers-2019-10">talking about it</a>.</p>
