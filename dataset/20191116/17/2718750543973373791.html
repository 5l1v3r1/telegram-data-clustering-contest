      <h1>What’s Going on With Pete Davidson and Kaia Gerber?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:45:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Arnold</a></address>
      <p>Sound the alarms: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/snl-pete-davidson-returns-from-the-upside-down-video.html">Pete Davidson’s</a> <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/pete-davidson-ariana-grande-big-dick-energy.html">enchanting big dick energy</a> may have landed him a new woman. This past week, he’s been spotted not once, but twice with the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/kaia-gerber-trolls-mom-cindy-crawford.html">model Kaia Gerber</a>, best known as Cindy Crawford’s 18-year-old daughter. (Because you’re wondering: Davidson is 25.) But does that mean something’s going on between the two? Are these hangouts, or perhaps dates? Have they … <i>kissed</i>? Here’s everything we currently know about their relationship.</p>
      <h3>So, what’s the evidence?</h3>
      <p>Admittedly, there’s not a ton<i> </i>yet. This Wednesday, a source told “<a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/23/pete-davidson-seen-leaving-kaia-gerbers-apartment-building/">Page Six</a>” that Davidson left Gerber’s apartment in Soho, where paparazzi captured the comedian walking around wearing a zip-up and AirPods. Most recently, a woman captured a sneaky photo of the two eating lunch in a cozy corner booth at Sadelle’s restaurant, in which Davidson is beaming at Gerber (while she stares at her iPhone. Modern love!).</p>

      <p>Admittedly, those two encounters didn’t look particularly romantic. But on November 4, Davidson “jetted across the States” to take Gerber to dinner at Nobu in her hometown of Malibu, the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7652753/Kaia-Gerber-Pete-Davidsons-date-hometown-Malibu.html"><i>Daily</i> <i>Mail</i></a> reports. The photos of this outing, as captured by the paparazzi, are compelling. Sitting across from each other in the front seat of Davidson’s Mercedes G wagon, the two can be seen staring into each others’ eyes, as if mesmerized. And on November 13, “<a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/13/pete-davidson-spotted-holding-hands-with-kaia-gerber-at-upstate-grocery-store/">Page Six</a>” published photos of the them holding groceries — but more importantly, <i>hands </i>— outside a supermarket in Hillsdale, New York. An upstate trip already? We’re moving fast, here.</p>
      <h3>When would they have met?</h3>
      <p>It’s likely the duo met this past June, when they both walked Alexander Wang’s spring 2019 runway — which also <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/snl-pete-davidson-made-runway-model-debut-alexander-wang.html">happened to be Davidson’s modeling debut</a>. Who among us, at one time or another, hasn’t swooned over a heavily tattooed man in a white tank top and backward baseball hat?</p>
      <h3>But didn’t Davidson just<i> </i>get out of a relationship?</h3>
      <p>Correct. Just last week, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/the-pete-davidson-margaret-qualley-thing-is-reportedly-over.html">Davidson split from his doppelgänger</a>, Margaret Qualley, after a few months of dating. But that’s not reason enough to shut down the possibility of Davidson and Gerber being “a thing.” Also, Gerber seems to be just his type.</p>
      <h3>How so?</h3>
      <p>Davidson loves a well-known celebrity daughter: He has dated Larry David’s (Cazzie David, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/pete-davidsons-ex-responds-to-him-dating-ariana-grande.html">remember <i>that?</i></a>), Andie MacDowell’s (Qualley), and now Gerber, who, as mentioned above, is Cindy Crawford’s daughter. It’s probably coincidental, but something to think about!</p>
