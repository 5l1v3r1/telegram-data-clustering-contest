      <p>A couple of days after <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Rajasthan-Royals">Rajasthan Royals</a> made a wish on Twitter to get star cricketers <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> and <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/AB-de-Villiers">AB de Villiers</a> onboard during the <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/IPL">Indian Premier League</a> (IPL) 2020 trade window, <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Royal-Challengers-Bangalore">Royal Challengers Bangalore</a> (RCB) instead, offered their insider Mr. Nags. Now, the Royals have responded to the RCB reply from a couple of days back and in a playful manner questioned the franchise as to why they did not release Mr. Nags. The Royals reply read, “Thought you’d be bold enough to release Mr Nags for the #IPLAuction.”</p>
      <p>It was interesting to see the Royals use the word ‘Bold’ in their post as ‘Play Bold’ is RCB’s tagline.</p>
