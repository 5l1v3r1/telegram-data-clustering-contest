      <p>Cheeky TV personality <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> had his social media followers in hysterics as he teased <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/amanda-holden/">Amanda Holden</a> over the injury she has sustained <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/amanda-holden-rushed-to-hospital-for-emergency-surgery/">to her leg</a>.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain host, 54, shared a snap of him with Amanda, 48, using crutches during their night out in London.</p>
      <p>Poking fun at Amanda's situation he couldn't help himself from punning in the Instagram post's caption.</p>
      <p>Piers wrote: "Legless (again) with Amanda."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Thousands of Piers' followers gave the pic their approval with Likes - and dozens of laughing emoji responses in the comments section suggested they found his joke amusing.</p>
      <p>Former newspaper editor Piers dressed very casually for the photo - wearing an old pair of lace-up shoes - while Amanda looked her typically glamorous self.</p>
      <p>Clearly not letting her crutches get in the way of her love of fashion, she wore a shiny trouser suit with matching jacket.</p>
      <p>Amanda was recently rushed to hospital <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/amanda-holden-rushed-to-hospital-for-emergency-surgery/">after breaking her leg in two places in an accident on holiday</a>.</p>
      <p>She described the accident during her Heart Radio gig and explained how an ocean obstacle course went very wrong as she attempted to "show off".</p>

      <p>She explained: "So basically I was trying to be a good mother... I put my book down, I put down the Uno cards… and I said to Hollie ‘Mummy can come on that with you’ and there’s this like, you remember [Total] Wipeout, that TV thing?</p>
      <p>"There’s like a children’s Total Wipeout thing in the middle of the sea and… mistily get round it and I thought yeah I can do that, so Hollie was doing brilliantly and going round it.</p>

      <p>However, she said that she ended up badly injuring herself badly during the course, and had to swim back to the shore "one legged".</p>
      <p>She continued: "I was showing off Jamie - I made it across to the other side and then my leg slipped because obviously its wet, like an inflatable thing in the sea, my leg slipped and it went the other way and I felt it break and I fell in to the sea and I had to swim back to the shore one legged."</p>
      <p>"I’ve broken it in two places, I’ve broken my fibula in two places and I was rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>"And I’ve got a metal plate and screws in my leg which currently is the fastest and easiest way for it to heal. I haven’t got a cast I’ve got like metal in my leg and a splint and it’s all wrapped up and it’s got a heartbeat in it."</p>
