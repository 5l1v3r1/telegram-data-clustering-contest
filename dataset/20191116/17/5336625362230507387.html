      <h1>'Joker' is the first R-rated movie ever to make $1 billion at the box office</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:14:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/adam-rosenberg/" target="_blank">Adam Rosenberg</a></address>
      <p>It's not even close.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i>'s worldwide box office earnings hit a total of of $999.1 million on Thursday. So if it hasn't happened already, it's going to be official by the end of the weekend: <i>Joker</i> will become the first R-rated movie in Hollywood history with a $1 billion box office.</p>
      <p>The movie already made history earlier in 2019 when its box office total climbed past $900 million – another first for the R-rated category. But $1 billion is a much nicer, rounder figure, right?</p>
      <p>This was bound to happen at some point, given the fact that box office totals are forever rising as a result of inflation. But it's telling the next-highest R-rated box office winner after <i>Joker</i> is <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i> ($828.8 million), which released in 2003. Not even recent smash hits like <i>Deadpool</i>, <i>Deadpool 2</i>, and <i>It – </i>all of which earned more than $700 million worldwide – came close.</p>
      <p>There's still just a big barrier for R-rated movies to achieve the kind of box office success that more crowd-pleasing options can deliver. Having to leave the kids at home for a trip to the movies isn't an appealing option for families in most cases, and that cuts out a large portion of the moviegoing population.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> also faced the arguable box office obstacle of a pre-release controversy around its star treatment of a villainous character. I say "arguable" because, for one, movie content controversies always seem louder online than they actually are. What's more, the same "oh no, it's controversial" concerns that led to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/joker-parental-warning/">a police presence at certain theaters</a> can also work to build hype.</p>
      <p>The more likely driver of <i>Joker</i>'s success is the overall bankability of a movie exploring the origin of Batman's arch-nemesis. Especially coming at a time when interest in comic book-adjacent storytelling is at an all-time high. <i>Joker</i>, with its "serious" star in Joaquin Phoenix and its grounded tone, seems to sell itself on being a smarter and less spectacle-driven comic book-ish tale.</p>
