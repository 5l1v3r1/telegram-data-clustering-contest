        <b>The Italian Rugby Federation have accepted the resignation of head coach Conor O'Shea.</b>
      </p>
      <p>O'Shea had a contract until May next year but has left the role he took up in 2016.</p>
      <p>It is being reported that the Irishman is expected to take up a role with the English RFU.</p>
      <p>Sources in Italy believe this is the reason for his departure.</p>
      <p>Italy say they are looking for a new coach to lead them through next year's Six Nations.</p>
      <p>O'Conor's last match in charge was the World Cup Pool B match against South Africa which Italy lost 49-3.</p>
      <p>They had to beat New Zealand in their final Pool game to reach the quarter-finals, but the game was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis.</p>
