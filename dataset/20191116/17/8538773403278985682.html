      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2869">Stefanos Tsitsipas</a> kept his nerve in the key moments to beat six-time champion <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=425">Roger Federer</a> 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the final of the season-ending ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas saved 11 of 12 break points and took advantage of an error-filled performance from Federer, who continually put his opponent under pressure only to come up short when it mattered.</p>
      <p>The Greek player next faces defending champion <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=2375">Alexander Zverev</a> or <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=1852">Dominic Thiem</a>.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, who is making his first appearance at the event, saved all six break points he faced in the first set. That included two at 5-3, when he needed seven set points before finally winning a marathon game.</p>
      <p>He broke again for a 2-1 lead in the second then saved three break points from 0-40 in the next game before Federer finally converted his fourth to level the set.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, 21, broke again with a forehand winner and saved two more break points from 15-40 down when serving for the match at 5-4.</p>
      <p>He didn't give Federer, 38, any more chances at a comeback, serving out the match with an ace.</p>
      <p>"No doubt I had my chances," Federer said. "I'm just frustrated I couldn't play better. And when I did and fought my way back, I threw it away again."</p>
      <p>The 17-year age gap between the two players was the largest in the history of the tournament.</p>

      <p>Tsitsipas is the youngest finalist in the ATP Finals since <a href="http://www.espn.com/tennis/player/_/id/284/juan-martin-del-potro">Juan Martín del Potro</a> (also 21) in 2009, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information. He is the 13th player to make the final in his debut in the event and would be the seventh debuting champion with a win on Sunday.</p>
      <p>For Federer, it was a surprisingly erratic performance after he played nearly flawless tennis to beat <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=296">Novak Djokovic</a> in straight sets Thursday to reach the semifinals.</p>
      <p>He finished that match with five unforced errors -- including two double-faults -- but had 26 in this match.</p>
      <p>In the first set, he lost only six points on his serve. By contrast, he won 18 points on Tsitsipas' serve but couldn't force a break.</p>
      <p>Federer was especially unhappy with the service break in the first set, when he missed two fairly routine overheads to give his opponent the early lead.</p>
      <p>"Getting broken with missing two smashes in one game, that hasn't happened in a long, long time. Or ever," Federer said. "So that was tough."</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas was coming off a three-set loss to <a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=261">Rafael Nadal</a> in his last round-robin match Friday but showed no sign of fatigue.</p>
      <p>Reaching the final is another milestone in a breakthrough season in which he also beat Federer on the way to the Australian Open semifinals.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas is now 2-2 against Federer after losing to him in the Dubai final and Basel semifinals this year.</p>
