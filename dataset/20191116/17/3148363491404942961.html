      <h1>Video: Jane Fonda Storms Senate Building During Climate Change Protest</h1>
      <h2>Actress and left-wing activist Jane Fonda led her sixth consecutive climate change protest on Friday, where she led a rally unlawfully into the Russell Senate Office Building.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:29:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/benjkew/, Ben Kew</a></address>
      <p>Fonda was joined at the protest, known as “<a href="https://firedrillfridays.com/">Fire Drill Fridays</a>,” by her <i>Grace &amp; Frankie</i> co-stars Brooklyn Decker and June Diane Raphael, as well as the show’s writers. Others present included <i>CSI</i> actress Marg Helgenberger, anti-vax activist Robert Kennedy Jr. and the filmmaker Abigail Disney.</p>
      <p>The rally took place on the Capitol lawn, before around 70 demonstrators marched toward and illegally entered the Russell Senate Office Building rotunda. Police arrested a number of protesters, including Raphael, Helgenberger, and Kennedy.</p>

      <p>Jane Fonda, meanwhile, has claimed that the objective of the rally is to pressure lawmakers into supporting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez’s (R-NY) “Green New Deal.”</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/25/study-green-new-deal-would-cost-93-trillion-over-four-times-the-national-debt/">one study</a>, the deal could $93 trillion, over four times America’s national debt, with the aim of phasing out the use of fossil fuels within the next 30 years.</p>
      <p>“Any real solution to climate change must have a strong commitment to environmental, gender and racial justice at its core,” Fonda wrote in a recent blog post.</p>
      <p>After being <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/11/watch-jane-fonda-arrested-at-climate-change-protest/">arrested</a> at four of the previous rallies, the 81-year-old Academy Award-winner confirmed that she would not get arrested again over increased penalties, involving court appearances and up to 90 days in jail.</p>

      <p>“I have been advised that, because I’ve had 4 arrests in a short period of time and I have a court date coming up mid-November concerning those arrests, if I get arrested again before then, I risk 90 days in jail,” she explained. “I can rebel and be more effective outside of jail.”</p>
      <p>Fonda’s demonstrations come after she took a break from acting and <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/11/jane-fonda-takes-break-from-acting-moves-to-washington-to-become-climate-activist/">moved</a> to Washington D.C. to pursue environmental activism and “be at the epicenter of the fight for our climate.”</p>
