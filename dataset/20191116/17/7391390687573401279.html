      <p>Let's face it: Dental care isn't always the most comfortable experience. Traditional flossing can leave you with bleeding, sore gums on a daily basis. Luckily, the <a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-water-picks-flossers-waterpik-airfloss.html">best cordless water flossers</a> are gentle on your gums without compromising on effectiveness, and you can use them just about anywhere.</p>
      <p>But before you buy a water flosser, it's important to consider any special dental requirements you may have. For example, if you have braces or retainers, you'll want to look for <a href="https://www.electricteeth.com/best-cordless-water-flosser/">a flosser with strong water pressure</a> — or at least a specialized head — to help remove plaque.<b> </b>Or if you tend to get cavities at the gum line, be sure to consider an option with a scrubber head that can <a href="https://lifehealthhq.com/do-water-flossers-work/">more easily clear away built-up plaque</a> on the surface of your teeth.</p>
      <p>You'll also want to keep in mind how often you plan on using your water flosser. While most cordless models are battery-operated, it can be cumbersome to change out batteries on a monthly basis. Be on the lookout for a rechargeable option (or a unique unit that operates on <a href="http://waterflosserreviews.com/shower-water-flossers-take-care-of-your-oral-health-in-the-shower/">water pressure from your shower</a>).</p>
      <p>Sit back and relax, I've got you covered. Here's a list of some of the <a href="https://www.health.com/oral-health/best-water-flossers">best cordless water flossers</a> out there to help keep it simple.</p>
      <h3>1. The Best Overall: Waterpik Freedom Cordless Water Flosser</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Not only is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0173PDOMA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-13606588-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0173PDOMA&amp;linkId=4bbaa9fbff511467878c3f3ef90bee77">this water flosser</a> by Waterpik sleek, it's extremely powerful, too. Approved by the American Dental Association, this cordless flosser features two pressure modes and comes with three separate flossing tips so you can target all areas of your gums, teeth, and mouth. It's also waterproof and portable — it doesn't require any sort of outlet or special charger, so you can just toss this flosser in its travel bag (which is included) and go. Plus, at only $46 for such a powerful device, it's a steal.</p>
      <p>With more than 2,000 positive reviews, this flosser is a hit with just about everyone, even people who are skeptical about changing out the batteries. One reviewer wrote, "OK, this thing is AMAZING!! I'm so glad I got this one as opposed to the rechargeable one. I've read reviews about the charging connection on rechargeable one becoming corroded since the socket is on the side and gets water and residue in it." There you have it.</p>
      <h3>2. The Most Affordable: BerZalah Cordless Water Flosser</h3>

      </p>
      <p>If you're looking for a slightly more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MJL9DW9/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-13606588-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07G75X9D2&amp;linkId=b29f969a91ef9c1f5bb344c7e88bfae1">affordable water flosser</a>, this device does the trick without compromising on quality. It features three pressure options (soft, normal, and pulse) to ensure you get every inch of your teeth with each use. It takes just four hours to charge this water flosser via USB, and on one charge you'll get two weeks of full use. The tank can hold 300 milliliters of water, so you won't have to refill it as often. Even better, this cordless water flosser comes with a two-year warranty so you can feel safe trying this one out.</p>
      <p>The only downside is that it doesn't come with flossing tips, so if you have braces, implants, or other dental issues that require extra care, you may want to check out another option. Still, one Amazon fan raves: "I am a skeptic these days when it comes to reviews on products, but I decided to go with this water flosser because of the warranty that came with it. I wanted to get away from regular flossing because I was tired of my gums bleeding and swelling from it. So far this product has worked. I double checked the water flossers worker the first few times with regular floss to see if it did it’s job and fortunately it did! If you’re looking to make the switch I would suggest this water flosser. It even comes with a portable bag and multiple tips."</p>

      <p>If you prefer efficiency when it comes to hygiene, consider this unique <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ES2HNI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-13606588-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B003ES2HNI&amp;linkId=a43b813eef0cf89fc2206265e5e94a47">in-shower water flosser</a>. It works in the same way traditional flossers do, only this unit is directly connected to your shower. Just hook up the tubing to your shower head, turn on the switch, and get started! You control the pressure by moving the switch, and it even comes with two flosser tips so you can really target any stubborn plaque. Plus, this system is super simple to clean — just let the water run through the hose and you're all set to go again.</p>
      <p>Nearly 2,000 Amazon reviewers have tried this flosser system out and love it. One fan says, "I currently own a WaterPik water floss and wanted to get something that I could use in the shower. I didn't want to deal with changing the water out each time on the WaterPik. This was exactly what I was looking for.The attachment is heavy and high quality. It's not cheap, nor is the hose or mount that comes with it. It even comes with a little plumber tape to connect the attachment. The instructions were easy to follow, but if you've ever connected/installed a showerhead this is equally a cakewalk.This is as good as the Waterpik -- actually better because I'll actually use it more with the convenience of it being in the shower."</p>
