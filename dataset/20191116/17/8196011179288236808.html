      <p>2007 hurler of the year Dan Shanahan helped St Mary’s to their maiden Munster championship win on Saturday afternoon at Fraher Field in his first year as team coach.</p>
      <p>First half strikes from Eoin Kearns, Mike Kearns and Jason Sheehan fired them to a famous quarter final victory over Limerick runners-up Castletown/Ballyagran.</p>
      <p>“You can’t beat that winning feeling,” said Shanahan afterwards.</p>
      <p>“They created history today, the first St Mary’s team to win a Munster club championship game. Two weeks ago, they created history again when they won a first county title in thirty years. It’s down to the players and the effort they’ve put in. To see the supporters on the field again today was unbelievable; that’s what club is about. For me to be helping the boys to do this; it’s an honour.”</p>
      <p>The former Déise selector remains as energetic as ever along the sideline.</p>
      <p>“I’m having more arguments on the line with the fourth official, I never lost it! When you’re involved with a group of players for the last twelve months, you’re very passionate.”</p>
      <p>St Mary’s led 3-5 to 0-9 at half time in front of 483 fans.</p>
      <p>Eoin Kearns buried a penalty in the tenth minute before his brother Mike flicked home a second less than sixty seconds later. Jason Sheehan struck a third on twenty minutes after collecting a knock-down from Mike Kearns. Six Harry Dore points (four frees) reduced the deficit to five at the break.</p>
      <p>Cork referee Simon Stokes issued ten yellow cards and three reds. Castletown/Ballyagran full back Paul Hourigan was first to walk on a second yellow five minutes into the second half. Darragh Cotter followed on a straight red while St Mary’s midfielder Sean Fitzpatrick received two yellows.</p>
      <p>Three points was as close as the visitors got. The black and amber squandered four scoreable frees. Eoin Kearns shot 1-6 for the winners while Kevin Sheehan and Cian Geary also hit vital second half points.</p>
      <p>They will be away to Carrick Davins in the last four.</p>
