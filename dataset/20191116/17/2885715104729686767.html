      <p>Medium pacer Karim Janat returned excellent figures of 5/11 and powered Afghanistan to a series-levelling 41-run victory over West Indies in the second T20 International here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Batting first after winning the toss, Afghanistan managed 147 for even in the stipulated 20 overs, and then, stopped West Indies at 106 for eight at the Bharat Ratna Shri <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/atal-bihari-vajpayee">Atal Bihari Vajpayee</a> Ekana Cricket Stadium.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Janat was the dayâ€™s top performer, picking the wickets of Evin Lewis, Shimron Hetmyer, Sherfane Rutherford, Kieron Pollard and Keemo Paul.</p>
      <p>Coming into the must-win game after losing the first T20I by 30 runs, Afghanistan were off to a quick start before Rahmanullah Gurbaz was dismissed by Kesrick Williams. The pacer was the most successful West Indies bowler, picking up 3/23 in his quota of four overs.</p>
      <p>Hazratullah Zazai (26), Janat (26) and Gulbadin Naib were the main contributors with the bat for Afghanistan.</p>
