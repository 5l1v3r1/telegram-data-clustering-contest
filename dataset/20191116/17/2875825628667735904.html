      <h1>It's time for UEFA to bin small fry nations from Euro qualifying - it's a waste of time</h1>
      <h2>Montenegro and Gibraltar are among the teams to have shipped six or more goals already during this round of European Championship qualifying</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:37:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>It's time the small fry were dumped out of the qualifying groups – it’s just a waste of time and effort and an insult to the cream of European football.</p>
      <p>Not very “all for one, and one for all”, but, seriously, what is the point?</p>
      <p>I can’t be the only one looking at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/england-football-team">England’s</a> potential fixtures against Liechtenstein in the run-up to Qatar in a couple of years with an inevitable sense of gloom.</p>
      <p>A quick glance down the results this week and a brief scan of the tables shows the same countries propping up the rest – welcome to European Championship ­“Groundhog Day”.</p>
      <p>For instance, it will surprise no one that San Marino have conceded 43 goals during their eight outings.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That’s an average of five goals per game – and doubtless some of their opponents took their foot off the gas.</p>
      <p>England smashed seven past a woefully weak ­Montenegro (Tammy ­Abraham in action, right). Portugal grabbed six against Lithuania – and face the might of ­Luxembourg on Sunday as Cristiano Ronaldo goes in search of yet another match ball.</p>
      <p>It’s the same story repeated time after time – and yes, I know France “only” beat ­Moldova 2-1 in midweek – but our friends from across the ­Channel were already through, so it was no biggie. Ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, ­Liechtenstein were bottom of their qualification group. As were San Marino, Gibraltar, the Faroe Islands... all getting thumped this time around.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a xenophobic rant, by the way – happy to embrace anyone as an equal – until it comes to watching yet another 90 minutes ­wondering when England will finally make the breakthrough against, say, Malta who have absolutely no intention of doing anything other than stuffing 10 ­outfield players within 30 yards from their own goal.</p>

      <p>UEFA need to streamline it so that bigger countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy, France and Holland don’t waste their time. Because there is ­absolutely nothing to stop countries further down the rankings playing a Round Robin to decide who gets to play the big boys.</p>
      <p>That way, spectators aren’t being fleeced and they can turn up knowing they are watching a proper game when the groups start.</p>
      <p>If a team such as ­Kosovo progress through the rankings, they won’t need to ­pre-qualify in future. Good luck to them.</p>
      <p>But when can you see that happening?</p>

      <p>It was brought home to yours truly at the opening squad announcement ahead of Euro 2016 when Roy ­Hodgson practically guaranteed England would reach France.</p>
      <p>And yet still the big-hitters to have to go through the ­motions against the likes of San Marino, Andorra and Gibraltar.</p>
      <p>It’s tedious.</p>
      <p>So, why don’t we face facts and dump some of the also-rans – it will be doing the majority of us a massive <br/>favour.</p>
