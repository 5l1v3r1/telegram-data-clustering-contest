      <h1>Steve Clarke praises Scotland reaction as he targets three in a row ahead of play-offs</h1>
      <h2>Scotland made it two wins in a row against Cyprus and now Clarke wants that winning mentality to continue.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:04:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> has revealed his delight at his side's reaction to conceding an equaliser in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Georgios Efrem cancelled out Ryan Christie's opener before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> sealed all three points and the way his side responded to adversity pleased the former Kilmarnock boss.</p>
      <p>It comes after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> capitulated after conceding the opener against Russia during the last international break and he feels it's a sign of how far they've come.</p>
      <p>His makeshift team battled hard against Cyprus in a game that lacked a lot of quality but Clarke was delighted with the result.</p>
      <p>He said: "Can you not tell (how happy he is)? With the smile on my face? It was important to build on the San Marino victory.</p>
      <p>"We knew it would be a difficult game because it was a difficult game at Hampden in June. Very similar game where we got ourselves in front.</p>

      <p>"I thought when we went in front we were the better team. Second half we conceded to another set play, or the second phase of a set play but it was a wonderful strike you have to give the lad credit.</p>
      <p>"The reaction was great, we got ourselves back in front with a really good team goal then we showed a bit of resilience to get the result we wanted."</p>
      <p>Scotland haven't won three in a row in two years but that's what Clarke is aiming for ahead of Kazahkstan on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>With wins over San Marino and Cyprus in their last two, Clarke is hoping it brings confidence ahead of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>He added: "There were some moments, I’m not going to sit here and say it was a fantastic performance it was a good performance. Sometimes when you’re coming out of the run of games we’re coming out of, it’s more important to win than the performance. The win tonight was crucial for us.</p>
      <p>"It gives us the opportunity to go home to face Kazakhstan, another three points would set us up nicely for the play-off games in March.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Another three points, home game at Hampden. I’ve got to mention the supporters here today. 3500 here and they’ll be going home with a smile on their face. They’ll have a really good night tonight before they get back on the plane.</p>
      <p>"It’ll be nice to see a few faces at Hampden on Tuesday night getting behind the players and hopefully we can finish with three wins in a row.</p>
      <p>"It’d be nice to finish with three in a row, which I’m reliably informed would be the first time in two years that happened so there’s another target for us.</p>
      <p>"Both goals were great, we know what Ryan can do coming off that right hand side, he’s got a wonderful left foot. I was a little bit surprised he got so much space and they sat off him a bit but as you know he can produce what he did. His work ethic was fantastic and James Forrest on the other side. It’s really important you’ve got two wide players who can create and also do the defensive work.</p>
      <p>"I can say that all the time but the proof of the pudding is when we get to March. It’s four months away. I’m learning in international football that you have to deal with the breaks. Normally there’s only two or three weeks between camps and now It’s four months and hopefully everyone is fit and well and available. Like I say, a win on Tuesday night and we go into the first play-off game on the back of three wins."</p>
