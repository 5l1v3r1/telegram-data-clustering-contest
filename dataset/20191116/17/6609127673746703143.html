        <b>A DEVASTATED Ayrshire mum has shared heartbreaking images of her baby whose stillbirth she claims was "completely preventable".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kirstyanne Mackie, 20, from Kilmarnock claims she was "neglected" and "let down" by hospital staff.</p>

      <p>She was left completely broken after claiming doctors failed to give her the c-section she was promised as she was at "high risk".</p>
      <p>The baby's dad Ryan Brown, 23, believes if she had been given the vital surgery their baby, Amelia Rose, would have survived.</p>
      <p>He branded Crosshouse hospital’s care ‘absolutely appalling’ and claimed "unsupportive staff" gave them the impression "there's nothing we can do, get out the door".</p>
      <p>Once the baby was born on November 7 they were given a family room to grieve, but Kirstyanne broke down after hearing other healthy babies cry just next door to them.</p>

        <figcaption>They are devastated</figcaption>

      <p>She claims she was also promised a private delivery room considering the circumstances, but instead had to give birth in a maternity ward with other parents.</p>
      <p>The traumatic experience was made even worse when the family suffered another blow claiming the hospital didn’t update them on Amelia-Rose's post-mortem.</p>
      <p>They instead had to find out if she had been transferred to a Glasgow hospital from their local funeral parlour. </p>
      <p>The distraught parents had so many questions for hospital staff after losing the baby but say they were repeatedly told "that is not for us to answer that is for a consultant".</p>
      <p>But Kirstyanne’s claims her consultant hasn’t been in touch since her appointment at 35 weeks pregnant, and says she hasn’t even been sent a letter by the NHS.</p>
      <p>Now the couple, who already have a two-year-old daughter Alisha Kayla Margaret Brown, are demanding a full investigation into Crosshouse hospital when the post-mortem comes back to find out what exactly went wrong. </p>
      <p>Kirstyanne said: “I feel so horrible and feel so neglected.</p>
      <p>“They just kept on telling me they wouldn’t leave me to go by 37 weeks as it could cause still born and they did.</p>
      <p>“That’s what happened to my wee girl and now she’s not here with us."</p>
      <p>Ryan said: “The way the hospital treated us was absolutely appalling they were not supportive.</p>
      <p>“They gave her a tablet to start her labour but it felt like they just thought ‘there's nothing we can do, get out the door’.</p>
      <p>“We had so many questions but they just kept saying that’s not for us to answer that's for a consultant but the consultant hasn’t been in contact since her last appointment at when she was at 35 weeks.</p>

        <figcaption>Their other daughter Alisha had been excited to meet her new sister</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“After the post mortem takes place on the 27th there will be a full investigation launched to how it happened.</p>
      <p>“When she gave birth they have us a family room that was supposed to be private to help us try and deal with it and process it, but we were still in the maternity room and could hear babies crying which just made Kirstyanne break down.</p>
      <p>“It was terrible for her.</p>
      <p>“On Tuesday she was moving and there was a heartbeat, it went to 114 beats per minute , then 60, then faded to 45 before it stopped.</p>
      <p>“She should have had surgery to prevent this happening I told them that but they said ‘it isn’t that simple, you can’t just cut someone open’.</p>
      <p>“If they had given her the C-section they could have saved her life.</p>
      <p>“They then told us oh we thought we found a heartbeat on the Tuesday but we didn’t but then another midwife told us no there definitely was a heartbeat.</p>

      <p>“It has been a nightmare we are definitely taking this further."</p>
      <p>Despite the horror ordeal Ryan said not every staff member treated them poorly with one midwife even bringing them comfort during the dark time.</p>
      <p>He added: “Once the baby passed away we requested her clothes be changed and I heard her talking to the baby and it made things slightly better.</p>
      <p>“She was talking away to her like she would any other baby even though she wasn’t breathing and it honestly gave me a lump in my throat.</p>

        <figcaption>They found out vital information about their daughter from the funeral parlour</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“It shows how good they can be they have some good staff so why did this happen.”</p>
      <p>The couple said the way they were treated made their experience even worse.</p>
      <p>Kirsty said: “It’s just the way they have treated me saying they would contact me if Amelia-Rose wasn’t going to Glasgow last Monday and nobody phoned me it was actually the funeral parlour that phoned my mum and told my mum that she wasn’t away.</p>
      <p>"I phoned Crosshouse there too see if Amelia-Rose was back and she is back and nobody has contacted me to let me know she was back yesterday I just had to phone them up and ask them if she was back.</p>
      <p>Kirstyanne shared the images of their tragic daughter to raise awareness of their case and help her get through this difficult time.</p>
      <p>Ryan said: “She shared the pictures on social media to raise awareness and is just trying to come to terms and accept it the most she can.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t even feel real, I am not happy at all with the hospital.</p>
      <p>“I would say this whole thing was preventable if she had just gotten a c-section.”</p>
      <p>Now the family is planning a funeral for tragic Amelia-Rose and are hoping their local community can help them pay for it.</p>
      <p>Kirstyann said: “Unfortunately we are still trying to come to terms with this devastating loss, each donation would be grateful and would help us in every way that’s possible.</p>
      <p>"Due to requesting our girl to be buried privately we are required to pay costs in advance before the burial can be proceeded.</p>
      <p>“Our beautiful girl deserves the send off any other family would want.”</p>
      <p>A statement from Tracy Dalrymple, Assistant General Manager at the University Hospital Crosshouse, read: "The loss of a baby is always tragic and our condolences and thoughts are with Ms Mackie and her family at this time.</p>
      <p>"NHS Ayrshire Arran cannot comment on individual patients but we would encourage Ms Mackie to contact us directly with any concerns about the care or treatment she received.</p>
      <p>"This allows us to investigate and provide feedback."</p>
