      <p>When the hardcore<b><i> Star Wars</i></b> fans watch the trailer for the new films under the Disney banner, many of them are emotionally moved. A lot of that emotion is triggered by the nostalgia that they feel while watching the trailers.</p>
      <p>I’ve got an interesting video essay here for you to watch today from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=emb_title&amp;v=7KOsM5Xfe_E">Patrick (H) Willems</a> that offers an in-depth look at the trailers for all three installments of the latest <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy. The video illustrates how the Lucasfilm marketing team has pretty weaponized nostalgia to get the fans excited.</p>
