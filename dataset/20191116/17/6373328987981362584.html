        <b>A Macbook Air, iPhone 11, AirPods and $4,000; this 10-year-old’s Christmas list will make your eyes water. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The festive season has undergone a seismic change since my youth. With the advent of amazing technology, for kids there’s simply too much to choose from.</p>
      <p>This young girl has a genius solution… just ask for everything.</p>

      <p>Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/a_johnson412/status/1194689352992903169">@A_Johnson412 shared the list on Twitter,</a> writing: ‘My 10 year old daughter must be out of her mind with this Christmas list.’</p>
      <p>It’s so well put-together, politely written and littered with hilarious spelling mistakes (‘asenchal oil’) that it’s impossible to be annoyed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Check out the amazing list below: </b>

      <p>You’ve got to admit, it’s a comprehensive list. I particularly like the inclusion of $4,000 so low down, almost like a last minute thought.</p>
      <p>Growing up, for me it was quite simple: games consoles. Whether it was the PS2, Xbox 360, Wii or PS4, a new console was the straightforward Christmas request. I’d probably add a couple of games to the list, and that would be it completed.</p>

      <p>Now, it’s different. Everyone wants the latest and best phones and computers, no matter their age.</p>
      <p>The dad’s followers are absolutely loving his daughter’s requests, calling her a ‘baby queen’.</p>
      <p>One user wrote: ‘An alarm clock, Gucci slides and some laundry detergent? Mama has range and her priorities in check!’ Another added: ‘Her taste is exquisite, I am impressed.’</p>

      <p>Since posting the list, the tweet has racked up nearly 120,000 likes and more than 22,000 retweets.</p>
      <p>One user wrote: ‘Get her that alarm clock sis! Lol tell her it’ll wake her up from that dream where she think she’s getting everything on there.’</p>
      <p>Another added: ‘Sneaking in that 4K at the bottom is a rockstar move.’ The dad replied: ‘Right like oh yea lemme ask for 4K too. Right by the bunny clothes.’</p>
