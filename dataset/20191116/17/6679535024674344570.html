      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas shocked six-time champion Roger Federer 6-3, 6-4 to reach the final of the ATP Finals in his tournament debut on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Greek sixth seed, 17 years younger than his opponent, beat the Swiss at the Australian Open but had fallen to him twice since then.</p>
      <p>Federer was unrecognisable from the player who dominated Novak Djokovic in his final round-robin match, struggling on serve and hitting a total of 26 unforced errors compared with just five against the Serbian.</p>
      <p>But Tsitsipas belied his years with a performance full of confidence and grit, saving 11 out of 12 break points during the match.</p>
      <h3>Great performance</h3>
      <p>“I'm so proud of myself today, a great performance and once again the people were great,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, Rafael Nadal headed home after defending champion Alexander Zverev's win against Daniil Medvedev confirmed the Spaniard's exit from the season-ending tournament.</p>
      <p>Zverev’s 6-4, 7-6(4) win meant he qualified for the semifinals from Group Andre Agassi.</p>
      <p><b>The results: </b><b>Semifinal: </b>Stefanos Tsitsipas bt Roger Federer 6-3, 6-4.</p>
      <p><b>Group Andre Agassi:</b> Alexander Zverev bt Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 7-6(4).</p>
