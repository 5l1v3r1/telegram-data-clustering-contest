      <h1>Sign a midfielder or do nothing - best and worse case transfer window scenarios for West Ham</h1>
      <h2>The January window is just around the corner and the rumour mill is already starting to bolt up into overdrive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini is not one to be busy in a January transfer window usually but if West Ham's slide continues then he may well have to be a bit more involved in the winter window.</p>
      <p>Only Samir Nasri arrived as a free agent last January as the manager was content with the squad he had. Nasri only featured six times for the Hammers but nothing ventured, nothing gained.</p>
      <p>West Ham are linked to seemingly hundreds of players each transfer window, even when they are closed as well, so don't expect anything different this time around.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini could do with a new midfielder, perhaps another striker and maybe a centre half but, as we know he won't be rushed into anything. The squad does need bolstering but whether there will be cash available for him to spend, we'll see.</p>
      <p>The manager has spent Â£150m over the last two summer windows so might have to deal in the loan/free agent market in January unless the board allow him some funds. That said, with the amount of pressure the boss is under and with a tough ficture list on the horizon, will he even be at the club to oversee it?</p>
      <p>That's a hypothetical for now, the manager isn't in any immediate danger of losing his job despite the wretched run of form, winless in their last six games and haven't picked up three points since September 22.</p>
      <p>So what are the best and worse case scenarios for the manager in terms of what could - or could not - happen in the January window?</p>
      <h3>Best case</h3>

      <p>A new midfielder arrives, which really is the key position for what Pellegrini needs to strengthen his squad.</p>
      <p>What kind of midfiilder? A central one, preferably box-to-box and someone who can help take the load a bit off Declan Rice, who's form has dipped in recent weeks for the first time since he broke through as a first team regular.</p>
      <p>Mark Noble's leadership is still vital but he is having less impact on the pitch and the Hammers could do with a bit more energy in the engine room and to start setting a bit of tempo to what has looked a very pedestrian pace in recent games.</p>
      <p>There aren't many names being linked with the Hammers just yet but they could take a look at Arsenal's Granit Xhaka, who looks likely to leave the club in January. He might not be box to box but would be an upgrade in midfield.</p>
      <p>AC Milan's Franck Kessie would be an option but he is likely to cost a fair bit of cash so might be a step too far. Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Charles Aranguiz too, but he won't cost as much and Pellegrini has tried to sign the midfielder before, last summer in fact but the Chilean didn't want to leave Germany.</p>
      <p>The perfect window? Another striker arrives but with Michail Antonio returning from injury in the very near future, that area of the pitch might not be such a pressing issue for Pellegrini.</p>
      <h3>Worst case</h3>

      <p>Nothing happens.</p>
      <p>The Hammers can't really afford to stand pat in January, they need reinforcements. Of course, a lot of that will depend on what happens between now and January because if the Hammers do find some form during what looks a brutal run of games, then the manager may well be happy with his lot.</p>
      <p>It's tough to do business in</p>
      <p>There are unlikely to be any departures in the month that would disrupt the team. Carlos Sanchez could go if an offer comes in for him as the Hammers have no plans to extend his contract past the summer when it expires.</p>
      <p>No doubt there will be rumours linking Declan Rice with a move away to Manchester United again and, according to reports, that may well go through this summer but the Hammers are determined to hold on to their prized asset.</p>
      <p>But, as previously mentioned, it'll be a big surprise if the Hammers stand still in this upcoming window. The squad doesn't look capable of mounting much of a challenge at the moment so some fresh faces, ideas and legs would certainly not be the worst thing.</p>
