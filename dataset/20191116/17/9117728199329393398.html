        <b>Michael Schumacher's wife Corinna says that he wants to keep his health a secret as he continues to recover from a skiing accident in 2013. Little is known about the seven time F1 champion's condition, with the family preferring to keep it an in-house matter.</b>

      <p>Schumacher's son Mick is racing in F2, and Michael knows how his son is getting on, but his wife Corinna says that he prefers his own condition to be kept private.</p>

      <p>Corinna told <i>She Mercedes </i>magazine: <i>"You can be sure that he is in the best hands and we do everything humanly possible to help him.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Please understand that we are following Michael's desire and that we have such a sensitive subject as his health, as always has been private."</i>

      <p>It is nearly six years since Schumacher's accident, and we hope the German does make a full recovery.</p>
