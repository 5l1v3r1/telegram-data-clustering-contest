      <p>No. 16 Boston College beat Vermont, 5-1, in a Hockey East matchup Friday, and York <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismpeters/status/1195550628417867776">earned his 1,074th victory</a> as a collegiate headcoach while the Hall of Fame game played out in Toronto.

      <p>To say those commentsruffled a few feathers on Twitter would be putting it lightly.</p>
      <p>Several media members who have covered York and his teams for years rose to the 74-year-old coach's defense, noting that his commitment to the collegiate game is what has earned him a spot in the Hall of Fame — and that hisinsistence on coaching BC before <a href="https://twitter.com/TomGulittiNHL/status/1195717907109613568">he joins his fellow inductees</a> for Sunday's Legends game and Monday's official ceremony is exactly in-character.</p>
