      <h1>French centrist party official indicted in European Parliament funds probe</h1>
      <h2>MoDem finance director first to be charged in ongoing investigation.</h2>

      <p>French authorities indicted a top official in François Bayrou’s centrist party on charges related to embezzlement of European Parliament funds, French media reported Saturday.</p>
      <p>Judges indicted Alexandre Nardella, MoDem’s finance director, on Friday with charges of complicity in embezzlement of public funds and concealment, according to <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/assistants-d-eurodeputes-un-premier-responsable-du-modem-mis-en-examen-16-11-2019-8194728.php">Le Parisien and AFP</a>, citing a judicial source.</p>
      <p>It’s part of a broader investigation into allegations that MEPs used money intended to compensate parliamentary assistants to pay the salaries of people who were actually doing work for the political party.</p>
      <p>That same scandal affected former MEP Sylvie Goulard’s bid to become a European commissioner last month. During her <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sylvie-goulard-sticks-to-her-guns-at-second-parliament-hearing-european-commission">confirmation hearings</a> in the European Parliament, Goulard denied allegations she used an assistant for domestic political work when she served as a MoDem MEP. However, Parliament’s internal market and industry committees ultimately <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/frances-commission-pick-sylvie-goulard-rejected-by-parliament/">rejected her candidacy</a>.</p>
      <p>Nardella was the first official to be heard by the judges in charge of the domestic investigation, which began in July 2017.</p>
      <p>Bayrou will be questioned December 6, with Goulard and former MEP Marielle de Sarnez also slated to be heard next month.</p>
