      <p>Suraj Bisht, who said he was native of Uttarakhand and works as a cook here, wanted to meet the Indian cricket captain.</p>
      <p>Security personnel stopped him and he was detained, a police officer said.</p>
      <p>He was wearing a T-shirt with Kohli’s name printed on it, had a tatoo of Kohli’s name on his arm, and ‘VK’ was written on his face.</p>
      <p>His identity was being verified and appropriate action would be taken thereafter, the police officer said.</p>
      <p>India beat Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match Test series. Mayank Agarwal bagged the man of the match for his double century.</p>
