      <p>BANGKOK — The United States and South Korea are postponing a joint military air exercise that North Korea has criticized as provocative.</p>
      <p>U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper and his South Korean counterpart made the announcement Sunday in Bangkok, where they were attending an Asia defence ministers conference.</p>
      <p>As recently as Friday, when Esper was in Seoul to consult with South Korean officials, there was no word on postponing the military air exercise, which had been called Vigilant Ace.</p>
      <p>Seoul and Washington had scaled back the exercise recently and changed the name, but North Korea strongly objected, calling it evidence of a lack of interest in improving relations.</p>
      <p>The North has demanded accommodations before it will agree to resume nuclear negotiations.</p>
