      <h1>Protestor Outside Falcons Facility Has Message For Colin Kaepernick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:06:10+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick is set to work out in front of 20-plus NFL teams in Atlanta this afternoon. The quarterback, who hasn’t played in the league since the 2016 season, is getting a chance to impress today.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28088983/sources-24-teams-attend-colin-kaepernick-workout">ESPN reports</a> that more than 24 teams will be in attendance for today’s workout, which is taking place at the Falcons’ facility.</p>
      <blockquote>Kaepernick, his receivers and NFL officials conducting Saturday’s workout will not be allowed into the facility until about 2 p.m. ET, when the Falcons are scheduled to depart for Carolina for their Sunday matchup with the Panthers, a source told Schefter. The Falcons are supplying an equipment person, a trainer and a videographer to help the NFL conduct Kaepernick’s workout.</blockquote>
      <p>Not everyone appears to be happy with today’s workout, though.</p>
      <p>There’s a protestor outside the Falcons’ facility in Atlanta, per The Undefeated:</p>

      <p>Whether or not you like Kaepernick, showing up with an American flag and a big sign protesting his workout seems to be a bit excessive.</p>
      <p>The quarterback’s workout is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>More details to come.</p>
