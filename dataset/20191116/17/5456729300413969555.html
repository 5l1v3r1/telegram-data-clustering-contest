      <p>The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, says crisis rocking Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso in Oyo State is unfortunate but surmountable.</p>
      <p>He made the disclosure during a courtesy call on the Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Michael Ologunde, on Saturday in Ogbomoso.</p>
      <p>The institution, co-owned by Oyo and Osun States, had been battling with crisis over the ownership.</p>
      <p>Mr Dare, who is an indigene of the town, said the problem bedevilling the institution were surmountable, assuring them that the university would rise again.</p>
      <p>The minister described the recent meeting of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and his Osun State counterpart, Gboyega Oyetola, in Abuja as apt.</p>
      <p>He said LAUTECH had consolidated on its leadership position as a University of Technology.</p>
      <p>Mr Dare called on stakeholders to collectively work towards returning the institution to the period of uninterrupted academic activities.</p>
      <p>The minister promised to play active role in finding lasting solution to the incessant closure of the university, which he described as a `model’.</p>
      <p>He said LAUTECH graduates were exceptionally good in their various chosen fields.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mr Ologunde, a professor, lauded President Muhammadu Buhari on the appointment of Mr Dare as a Minister, saying his choice was an indication that government truly believed in the youth.</p>
      <p>He admonished the minister to use his good office to help humanity and assist educational institutions as moulders of the nation’s future leaders to achieve their mandates.</p>
      <p>The minister later delivered the 13th annual lecture of the LAUTECH Alumni Association.</p>
