      <h1>Mike Francesa fallout: WFAN nearing successor, ESPN lures Bart Scott</h1>

      <p>The post-Mike Francesa era is coming into focus, and it will amp up WFAN’s rivalry with ESPN New York, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>Bart Scott is expected to leave WFAN to join ESPN, where he will be part of a new 1-3 p.m. local team on 98.7 FM, according to sources. ESPN has had interest in Chris Carlin, but Alan Hahn emerged as a potential internal candidate to be Scott’s partner.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the duo of Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts has become the favorite to move to afternoons on WFAN and replace Francesa, according to sources. Nothing is yet finalized.</p>
      <p>FAN had considered a three-person team, but with Scott intent on leaving, it is likely the station will abandon that idea. FAN had John Jastremski team with Scott and Maggie Gray this week.</p>
      <p>FAN planned to have Roberts join Scott and Gray for shows this coming week, but scrapped the plan as it became apparent Scott wanted out.</p>
      <p>This forced FAN’s hand, with the station still trying to figure out things post-Francesa.</p>
      <p>Francesa will have a sliver of his programming on WFAN in the future, but is moving the majority of it to Radio.com beginning next year as part of a three-year deal.</p>
      <p>Gray is expected to be half of the midday show, if the “Joe &amp; Evan” show goes to afternoons when the new schedule begins in January.</p>
      <p>For ESPN, it could offer the Scott show regionally, as well with a still-to-be announced national 1-3 p.m. program for ESPN Radio.</p>
      <p>The national show opening came about with Stephen A. Smith moving off radio with his new five-year deal worth a little less than $8 million annually, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/stephen-a-smith-rakes-in-almost-8m-per-year-on-new-espn-megadeal/">as The Post previously reported</a>. Will Cain remains the favorite to host the 1-3 p.m. ESPN national show.</p>
      <p>Scott’s new role will also give him prominence on TV, as he will be a football analyst on “Get Up!” and other ESPN shows.</p>
