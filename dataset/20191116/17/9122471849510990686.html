      <h1>Urban Meyer Owns Michigan On FOX’s College Football Pregame Show</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:25:09+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>We’re still a few weeks away from another Ohio State-Michigan showdown, but Urban Meyer is already throwing shade at the program from Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>Meyer is no longer the head coach of the Buckeyes, however, it’s obvious that he still represents his former program well.</p>
      <p>During his time at Ohio State, Meyer never lost to Michigan. He made sure to remind fans in Ann Arbor of his perfect record.</p>
      <p>Before FOX’s <i>Big Noon Kickoff </i>show came to an end, Meyer was asked if he knew any of the lyrics to Michigan’s fight song. His response was about as good as it gets.</p>
      <p>“I know 7-0,” Meyer said.</p>
      <p>That’s the equivalent of a punch to the gut for the Wolverines.</p>

      <p>Ohio State and Michigan will meet in two weeks from today. It’ll be the first time that Ryan Day is the head coach for this matchup.</p>
      <p>The pressure will be on Jim Harbaugh to lead the Wolverines to a victory. Over the years we saw him struggle mightily against Meyer, which includes last year’s blowout loss.</p>
      <p>FOX will be covering this year’s showdown between Ohio State and Michigan. It’ll be interesting to see if Meyer has any other comments to make about his former rival.</p>
