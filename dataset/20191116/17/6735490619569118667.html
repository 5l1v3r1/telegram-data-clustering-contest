      <h1>Prince Andrew Uses Lack Of Sweating As Proof He Never Met Virginia Roberts: ‘I Have A Peculiar Medical Condition Which Is That I Don’t Sweat’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Samhan</a></address>
      <p>BBC’s interview with Prince Andrew was a sloppy mess of “I don’t remember” which many have pointed out remind them of Bill Clinton’s “I did not have sex with this woman.”</p>
      <p>Emily Maitlis grilled Andrew in a pre-recorded interview filmed at Buckingham Palace. And while the palace did not have control over the interview, it was shown to Queen Elizabeth before it aired.</p>
      <p>In the interview, Andrew says his biggest regret was not cutting ties with Epstein after his 2008 conviction on charges of soliciting the services of an underage prostitute.</p>
      <p>“I kick myself for [it] on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family,” Andrew said. “We try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.”</p>
      <p>Although when Maitlis asked if he regrets having a relationship with Epstein, Andrew paused and couldn’t give a straight answer.</p>
      <p>Virginia Roberts claims to have spent time with Andrew on March 10, 2001 where they headed to Tramps Nightclub in London before having sex with him when she was only 17.</p>
      <p>“There are a number of things that are wrong with that story, one of which is that I don’t know where the bar is in Tramps. I don’t drink, I don’t think I’ve ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there,” Andrew said.</p>

      <p>He added that he was spending the evening with his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Eugenie.</p>
      <p>“I was with the children and I’d taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at I suppose sort of 4 or 5 in the afternoon,” he said. “And then because the Duchess [Sarah Ferguson] was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other one is there. I was on terminal leave at the time from the Royal Navy so therefore I was at home.”</p>

      <p>More evidence Prince Andrew gave towards why Roberts made-up meeting him included that she said he was “sweating profusely” and he claims that due to stress in the Falkland Wars he wasn’t able to physical sweat at the time.</p>
      <p>“There’s a slight problem with the sweating because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Andrew also states that men having sex will remember it happening because of the effort they have to put out and he does not remember having sex with Roberts.</p>
      <p>“If you are a man you have to take some sort of positive action to have sex with someone that you have to remember and I don’t remember anything,” he added.</p>

      <p>Roberts’ legal team has said “You could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on.” However, Andrew felt that because of his situation he would have been able to.</p>
      <p>“I live in an institution at Buckingham Palace which has members of staff walking around all the time and I don’t wish to appear grand but there were a lot of people who were walking around Jeffrey Epstein’s house. As far as I was aware, they were staff, they were people that were working for him, doing things.”</p>
      <p>When asked further if he saw underage girls at Epstein’s house, he said, “You would notice if there were hundreds of underage girls in Jeffrey’s house, wasn’t there, not when I was there. Now he may have changed his behaviour patterns in order for that not to be obvious to me. You’re asking me to speculate on things that I just don’t know about.”</p>

      <p>Maitlis inquired, “If Virginia Roberts is watching, what is your message to her?” Prince Andrew responded, “I have no message.”</p>
      <p>Andrew testifying under oath came up, but once again he couldn’t give a straight answer.</p>
      <p>“I would have to take all the legal advice, but if push came to shove and legal advice said I should then I would have to,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It has been as a constant sore in the family, we all knew him.” Andrew described how the scandal has affected his family. We wonder “what on earth happened.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe it has been damaging to the Queen at all, but it has to me.”</p>

      <p>In his final words, Maitlis gave Andrew the chance to give his last thoughts where he called Epstein’s actions “unbecoming.”</p>
      <p>“He was a sex offender,” Maitlis rebutted.</p>
      <p>An aide for Prince Andrew told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7693471/Prince-Andrew-speaks-publicly-time-relationship-Jeffrey-Epstein.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a>, “It was certainly the hardest thing he has ever done. For any of us to talk about this stuff no matter who you are, it would be difficult. It takes a huge amount of courage.”</p>
      <p>Twitter also didn’t know how to react.</p>
