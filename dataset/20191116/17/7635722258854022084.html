        <b>Darren Randolph is fit for the Republic of Ireland's must-win clash with Denmark on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Middlesbrough 'keeper trained with the squad in Dublin today after shaking off a thigh issue.</p>
      <p>"I said we'd wrap Darren Randolph in cotton wool ahead of the Denmark match and we’ve almost been true to my word," <a href="https://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/randolph-fitness-boost-ahead-of-denmark-game">manager Mick McCarthy told FAI.ie after training</a>.</p>
      <p>"He wasn’t involved for the New Zealand win on Thursday night and he’s done most of his work in the gym this week so it was great to see him working on the pitch today.</p>
      <p>"Like everyone else in the squad, Darren is fit and raring to go and he can’t wait for the game now."</p>
      <p>Denmark arrive in Ireland on the back of a 6-0 win over Gibraltar last night while Switzerland picked up a hard-fought 1-0 victory at home to Georgia. It means the Republic of Ireland need to a victory against the Danes to secure their passage to the finals.</p>
      <p>"The results on Friday were exactly as expected but with Switzerland-Georgia being such a close game," McCarthy added.</p>
      <p>"I did cheer that late Switzerland goal as it means a one-goal win will do us on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Denmark will be happy with their result but we knew before their game that we'd have to beat them and that’s still the case. Nothing has changed."</p>
