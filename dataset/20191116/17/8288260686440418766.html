      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | AVFC will be without their first and second choice goalkeepers due to injury when they resume their Premier League campaign after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:46:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:46</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Former Leeds United striker Noel Whelan has been discussing the recent injuries to two <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> goalkeepers.</p>
      <p>Tom Heaton, who signed by the Lions for £8m from Burnley in the summer, picked up an injury in the build-up to last weekend’s defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>The injury forced the stopper to withdraw from the England squad for this month’s round of international fixtures.</p>
      <p>And to make matters worse, stand-in keeper Jed Steer was forced off early in the loss at Molineux with a calf injury, and replaced by <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-heaton-17256399">Orjan Nyland</a> .</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>With timescales on Heaton and Steer’s injuries unclear, it appears that Nyland will be Villa’s preferred keeper for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>Whelan says it is “massively cruel” what has happened to Villa with the injuries, especially for Steer who has been waiting in the wings behind Heaton all season so far.</p>
      <p>“Rarely do you see injuries to goalkeepers but you’ve got two within the space of one game for Aston Villa,” Whelan told Football Insider.</p>

      <p>He added: “It’s massively cruel, especially when you’ve got to bide your time behind a fantastic keeper in Heaton.</p>
      <p>“With that opportunity, to get that injury so early in the game is just crazy but I suppose that’s just life of being a footballer, you’ve just got to roll with it.</p>
      <p>“Now Aston Villa are in the predicament of having the one goalkeeper and they’ll have to dip into the under-23s I would have thought.”</p>
