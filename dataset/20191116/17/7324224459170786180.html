      <p>It was the home side who burst out of the blocks and they almost took the lead within the opening minute.</p>
      <p>As we started to get into our stride, a header from a corner was scrambled off the line before Rowley and Whittingham combined well to set up Letford whose strike was saved.</p>
      <p>We were working hard to keep the home side at bay whilst looking a threat on the break with Moore going close and Whittingham seeing a strike deflected just wide.</p>
      <p>The home side were seeing plenty of the ball in the middle of the park and Flatt had to be alert to make a couple of good saves.</p>
      <p>At the other end, a free-kick from Moore just past the half-hour forced a smart one-handed save from the ‘keeper who then thwarted Rowley and Whittingham in quick succession.</p>
      <p>There was plenty of ebb-and-flow to the game but it remained goalless going into the break.</p>
      <p>The early action of the second period saw a clearance from Charlton almost rebound into the net off the home front-man.</p>
      <p>Waldron and Whittingham went close in quick succession but it was the home side who edged in front with ten minutes to go with a header.</p>
      <p>As we pushed for a leveller, we were rewarded with two minutes to go when Whittall headed home from a Moore corner.</p>
      <p>We looked the most likely side in stoppage time but had to settle for a point as the home side were reduced to ten men.</p>
      <p><b>Rushall:</b> Flatt, O’Callaghan (Lund 85), Charlton (Burroughs 54), Clarke, Whittall, Pendley, Moore, Rowley, Whittingham. Letford, Waldron (Sawyers 64). Subs not used: Finn, Mansell.</p>
