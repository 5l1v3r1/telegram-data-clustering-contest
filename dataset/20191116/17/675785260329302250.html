      <p>Shoppers can get a pint with their pinta thanks to a new doorstep delivery service.</p>
      <p>Dairy giant Milk &amp; More has started dropping 330ml bottles of low-alcohol lager, pale ale and brown ale with the morning milk.</p>
      <p>It is part of a drive to woo back families to traditional deliveries after years of declining sales.</p>
      <p>Almost all households had milk delivered to their door up until the 1970s.</p>
      <p>A supermarket price war and cheaper plastic bottles saw sales plummet.</p>
      <p>But now thousands are switching back to glass amid a backlash against plastic.</p>

      <p>The number of doorstep drops has jumped from 800,000 a day to a million in two years.</p>
      <p>Milk &amp; More, which uses electric carts to serve 500,000 homes, was relaunched by German giant Muller last year.</p>

      <p>It has linked up with Ipswich-based brewer Big Drop, which offers doorstep beers at £1.99 per bottle.</p>
      <p>It can be ordered online and delivered alongside dairy products – and even the Christmas turkey – before 7am.</p>
