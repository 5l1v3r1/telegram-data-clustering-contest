      <p>More women than ever are set to stand in the General Election next month.</p>
      <p>Labour has set a record with more than 50 per cent of its candidates being women, which is a historic first for any major political party in the UK.</p>
      <p>By contrast, about three in 10 of those standing for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are women.</p>
      <p>Two of the smaller parties – the Greens and the SNP – have higher levels of female representation than both the Tories and the Lib Dems put together.</p>
      <p>According to provisional analysis collated by PA news agency, 1,120 female candidates have registered to stand – making up 34 per cent of the total.</p>

      <p>And while there is still some way to go for women to be given equal representation, this is the highest proportion of female candidates ever in a general election.</p>

      <p>Figures have continued to climb from 215 which saw just 26 per cent, while 2017 saw this rise to 29 per cent.</p>
      <p>Labour is fielding 631 candidates in this election – which does not include the newly elected Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle – and 333 of these are women, making up 53 per cent of candidates.</p>
      <p>The overall number of candidates in December’s poll is currently 3,322, which is a slight increase from 3,304 who stood in 2017.</p>
      <p>However, this number could change over the next few days.</p>
      <p>For Labour, the number of female candidates has seen a big jump from 42 per cent from the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>For the Conservatives, 190 of their 635 candidates standing in this election are women, making a total of 30 per cent – this is a small increase on the last election of 29 per cent.</p>
