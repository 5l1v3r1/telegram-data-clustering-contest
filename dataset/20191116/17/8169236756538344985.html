      <h1>Manchester United target hints at “dreams” away from his current club</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:21:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10359383/man-utd-spurs-transfer-bruno-fernandes-sporting-lisbon/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573920807">the Sun</a>, Manchester United target Bruno Fernandes admits he has “dreams” within football although he’s not willing to “force” through an exit from Sporting Lisbon.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international also attracted interest from Tottenham Hotspur this summer and it would be interesting to see if the north London club still see the ace as a potential replacement for Christian Eriksen.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino’s side did however add an attacking midfielder this summer in Giovani Lo Celso.</p>
      <p>The Sun add that Fernandes was valued at more than £60m during the summer, do you think the Sporting Lisbon will have to drop their asking price for the star now?</p>
      <p>Spanish outlet <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/quiere-sustituir-modric-llama-florentino-perez-ofrece-madrid">Don Balon</a> have also reported that Real Madrid are interested in the playmaker, can either Premier League giant beat Zinedine Zidane’s side to securing a potentially key signing?</p>

        <b>Here’s what Fernandes had to say on his future:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I’m not worried, since 2016 I’m at Sporting and they say I’m leaving, so far I’m fine.</p>
      <p>“I have dreams to come true, but I’m not worried, I have no reason to force out, I’m fine, in a club I like.</p>
      <p>“On the day I have to leave, if I have to, I hope to leave a good memory.”</p>
      <p>Fernandes hasn’t been as sensational as he was last season, although he’s still shown more than enough to prove he deserves a move to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has five goals and five assists in 10 top-flight appearances for Sporting, the ace has also scored three times and registered an assist in four Europa League outings.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have seriously struggled with their chance creation in several matches so far this season, Fernandes has all the tools to rejuvenate United’s midfield.</p>
      <p>It would be interesting to see how he’d play alongside superstar Paul Pogba who has missed a large portion of this campaign with injury troubles.</p>
      <p>The main stumbling block for United and Tottenham if they’re to go head-to-head with Madrid is that it’s not looking likely that they’ll be able to offer Champions League football to the star next season.</p>
