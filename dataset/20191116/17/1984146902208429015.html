      <p>There's thirst quenching news for a popular Newcastle bar this week with the news that it has been named one of the best cocktail bars in the UK.</p>
      <p>Colonel Porters Emporium, on the bottom of Dean Street near the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/quayside-newcastle">Quayside</a> , has only been open for two years but has established itself as a big favourite among locals and visitors to the city.</p>
      <p>And now it has had the seal of approval on a national scale as a leading hen party company has named it as one of the best cocktail bars in the UK.</p>
      <p>GoHen has compiled a top 40 list of its favourite places to go for a cocktail all over the country and Colonel Porters is the sole representative from Newcastle, with the other 'North East' picks (though we're not sure on the geography!) being in Leeds and Sheffield.</p>
      <p>The glowing review of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-restaurants">bar and restaurant</a> Colonel Porters reads "Newcastle is bold, bright and brilliant, and the Colonel Porters Emporium is a shining jewel in the crown of its vibrant bar scene. As well as its fabulous array of cocktails, the venue itself is superb and the décor is resplendent and retro.</p>
      <p>"No stranger to a GoHen list, they return as one of the best cocktail bars in the UK and they are certainly a standout entry."</p>
      <p>Colonel Porters will be the place to be this weekend as they are bringing some Ibiza sunshine to Newcastle this Saturday in the shape of Melon Bomb.</p>
