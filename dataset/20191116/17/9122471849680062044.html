      <h1>Video: Coach O Gives Emotional Interview On College GameDay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:08:11+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend, Ed Orgeron earned the most significant win of his coaching career by leading LSU to a road victory over Alabama. Despite being doubted over the past few years, Coach O proved that he’s one of the best leaders in college football.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, ESPN’s <i>College GameDay</i> shared an emotional interview based on Orgeron’s career.</p>
      <p>Before Orgeron came to LSU, he spent time as an assistant coach at USC. Once the Trojans decided to fire Lane Kiffin, he became the interim coach.</p>
      <p>USC actually went 6-2 with Orgeron as the head coach, which led him to believe that he’d keep the job. Instead, the program went in a different direction by hiring Steve Sarkisian.</p>
      <p>Orgeron admit that not getting the USC job was one of the worst moments in his life. However, he also realized that he wouldn’t be where he is right now if that didn’t happen.</p>
      <p>Now that Orgeron is on the verge of taking the LSU Tigers to the College Football Playoff, all the naysayers have finally backed off.</p>
      <p>You can check out the interview here:</p>

      <p>It was an extremely touching interview from Orgeron, who said he treats his players like they’re his own sons.</p>
      <p>Regardless of which team you support on Saturdays, it’s hard to not root for Coach O. Even when all the odds were stacked against him, he found a way to reach the top of the mountain in college football.</p>
