      <h1>The genius new Gareth Bale chant Wales fans are singing tonight</h1>
      <h2>Wales. Golf. Real Madrid. In that order</h2>

      <p>He hit the headlines prior to Wales' Euro 2020 qualifier with Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>And Gareth Bale is the proud owner of a new chant that was aired by fans at the Bakcell Arena on Saturday. You can follow <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/azerbaijan-v-wales-live-kick-17268321">live updates here.</a></p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid player Pedja Mijatovic recently stuck the boot into Bale, criticising the Cardiff-born star's love of golf.</p>
      <p>In a column for Spanish media outlet AS, he wrote: "The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid."</p>
      <p>It prompted one fan into adding the slogan "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order" to a Welsh flag.</p>

      <p>And supporters in the away end for the clash with Azerbaijan in Baku belted out a rendition of "Wales. Golf. Madrid" to the tune of Viva Gareth Bale.</p>
      <p>It's one that will almost certainly get another airing when Wales take on Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium on Tuesday night, although don't expect it to be adopted in the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>Bale this week <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gareth-bale-real-madrid-wales-17262408">spoke about the abuse</a> he continues to get from the Spanish media over his love of golf and perceived lack of commitment to Real, insisting he found it all hilarious.</p>
