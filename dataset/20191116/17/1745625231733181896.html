      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/miranda-lambert/">Miranda Lambert</a> stunned fans with a photo of her hot outfit from this week’s <i>CMA</i>s. Yesterday, the blond bombshell took to her popular Instagram page to share two new photos from a star-studded evening and one of country music’s biggest nights. In the sizzling new post, Lambert tagged herself in Nashville, Tennessee where the awards were held.</p>
      <p>In the first image in the series, the country singer was all smiles as she struck a pose on the red carpet with her hunky hubby, Brendan McLoughlin. The pair could be seen posing with a white and gold <i>CMA</i> step and repeat just at their backs. Miranda looked drop-dead gorgeous in a tight pink dress that had a fun gold pattern running throughout the gown. The blond beauty showed off plenty of cleavage for the camera as well as plenty of thigh in the dress that featured a thigh-high slit.</p>
      <p>Miranda wore her long, blond locks down and slightly curled in addition to a gorgeous application of makeup that included eyeliner, eyeshadow, blush, highlighter, and lipstick. In the image, she put one arm around her man who looked just as good as his wife, rocking a tailored black tuxedo that fit him like a glove. In the second photo in the series, Miranda held her guitar over her shoulder as she performed one of her hit songs on stage.</p>
