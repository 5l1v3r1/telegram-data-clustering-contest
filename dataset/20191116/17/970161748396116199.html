      <p>Jessica-Mae Harnett suffered her fair share traumatic childhood experiences because of her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/26/model-who-struggled-with-career-after-alopecia-is-glad-it-happened-10072926/">alopecia</a>, but she isn’t letting it hold her back.</p>
      <p>The Milton Keynes-based accounts manager has overcome severe ‘playground bullies’ to become a competitor in British beauty pageants.</p>
      <p>‘The first time I suffered with hair loss, the doctors put it down to stress but I was only three years old so there was nothing to be stressed about,’ the now 21-year-old said.</p>
      <p>Her condition, known as alopecia totalis, involves the complete loss of scalp hair. It only worsened as Jessica grew older. At age 12, she lost 80% of her hair in just a fortnight.</p>

      <p>‘I remember waking up and there was hair all over my pillow … And it continued to fall out when I brushed it, I was sobbing watching my hair fall to the floor.’</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, she had just started high school when this happened, and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/02/going-back-to-school-is-tough-but-its-even-harder-when-youre-bullied-10669791/">bullies were relentless</a>. So she cut off what was left of her hair and wore a wig.</p>
      <p>‘My self-esteem was so low; people would always assume it was something more sinister and call me ‘cancer girl’ or pull my wig off.’</p>

      <p>While there is currently no cure for alopecia totalis, there are cases of sufferers experiencing hair regrowth after several years.</p>
      <p>Jessica is one of these cases. She now maintains a healthy head of hair by undergoing scalp dermabrasion every six months and consistently taking vitamins C, D, B13 and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/03/05/the-best-vitamins-to-improve-hair-nails-and-tiredness-6410452/">folic acid</a>.</p>
      <p>After competing in Swimsuit British Isles this year, she has her sights set on the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/21/muslim-miss-england-contestant-becomes-first-to-wear-wetsuit-instead-of-bikini-10433971/">Miss England beauty pageant</a> next year. Jessica hopes to use it as a platform to encourage people who are struggling with alopecia.</p>
      <p>‘It felt amazing and it has pushed me to act as an advocate for alopecia – I want people who have it to stay strong as it will be fine in the end.’</p>
