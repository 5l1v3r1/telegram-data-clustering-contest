      <h2>NBC’s Will &amp; Grace resumed its attacks against conservative Americans, describing those who protested against an explicitly anti-Trump bakery as “Neo-Nazis.”</h2>

      <p>On Thursday episode, “The Chick or the Egg Donor,” Jack and Karen are discussing ways to rescue a baseball team bought under Katen’s name by her ex-brother-in-law Danley (played by leftist actor Patton Oswalt).</p>
      <p>As the pair brainstorm, a woman knocks on the door to deliver food to Karen. However, she quickly realizes that the woman is Amy, a bakery owner who faced angry protests from Trump supporters after she <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/03/16/will-grace-maga-cake-episode-mike-pence-gay-conservatives-nazis/">refused</a> to bake Karen a Make America Great Again (MAGA) cake in the previous season.</p>
      <p>The conversation quickly turns to Jack noting that the incident turned the bakery into a “hub for Neo-Nazis,” before Karen suggests they change their team name to “Racist Jokes,” which she claims America “will love.”</p>
      <p>As transcribed by Newsbusters:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Amy:</b> Delivery! <b>Karen:</b> Come in. I ordered some brain food to help us think. <b>Jack:</b> Ooh, I was wondering if we were ever gonna take a break. <b>Amy:</b> Oh, my God. I know you. You ruined my life. <b>Karen</b>: Honey, you’re gonna have to be a lot more specific than that. Wait, if you’re Lori Loughlin’s kid, I told her no one would buy you as a varsity rower. <b>Amy</b>: You ordered a MAGA cake from my bakery. It sent my life into a death spiral. But now, I push muffins door to door in office buildings. Hakuna matata! <b>Jack</b>: Wait, I remember you. Grace and Karen turned your bakery into a hub for neo-Nazis. Hey, how’s that going? <b>Amy</b>: Well, it’s closed now because it’s been officially designated a hate space, so now I bake in my studio apartment. I mix the batter in the tub. <b>Karen:</b> Jackie, what if we change the name of the team? Instead of the Millstones, we find a name America will love, like the Racist Jokes.</blockquote>
      <p>The revival of the NBC show, which ran in the late 1990s but returned to screens in 2017, has largely left audiences disappointed. Many fans have <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/11/02/will-grace-producers-metoo-episode-inspired-by-kavanaugh-accusers/">attacked</a> the show for being too political, as it regularly explores left-wing themes such as anti-Trump hysteria, disdain for conservative values, and the promotion of the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>In fact, <i>Will &amp; Grace</i> ratings fell to a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/15/debra-messings-will-grace-ratings-tank-to-new-low/">new low</a> this week, especially among the all-important 18-49 demographic. According to <i>The Wrap</i>. In its 9:30 time slot, the show only attracted 0.4/2 and 2.1 million viewers, well behind other sitcoms including CBS’s freshman sitcom, <i>Carol’s Second Act </i>and ABC’s <i>A Million Little Things.</i></p>
