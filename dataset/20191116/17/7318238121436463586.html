      <p>France's "yellow vest" ("gilets jaunes") protesters were back out on the streets on Saturday - a year after their first demonstration.</p>
      <p>Rubbish bins and cars were set on fire, while police fired tear gas.</p>
      <p>By 15:00 CET, 61 people had been arrested.</p>
      <p>The movement began in November 2018 amid anger over an increase in fuel taxes but snowballed into a general anti-government protest.</p>
      <p>Macron backed down on the fuel tax and offered â‚¬10 billion in measures to address protesters' concerns.</p>
