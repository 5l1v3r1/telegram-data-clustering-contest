      <p>A police spokesperson said that officers are continuing to carry out stop searches in these areas and will 'maintain an increased' <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">police presence</a> in these communities.</p>
      <p>Chief superintendent Matt Boyle, Head of local policing, said: "Our increased disruption activity across Merseyside continues this weekend. We'll keep acting on all information received to bring about positive results like you see here last night, and remove drugs, weapons and those people who cause harm from your communities.</p>
      <p>"Key to this work are the residents most affected, so help us make your streets safe to live, and hostile places for criminals to operate.</p>

      <p>"The action continues on a daily basis, and we’ll use everything within our powers to bring anyone responsible for drug supply and other serious and organised crime to justice.</p>
      <p>"This includes warrants, the continued use of stop searches to disrupt criminals, and land searches in areas we believe they may be storing weapons.</p>
