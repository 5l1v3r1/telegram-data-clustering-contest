      <p><b>Asansol: </b>Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Saturday dubbed AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi as 'second Zakir Naik' for demanding the restoration of Babri mosque in Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>"Asaduddin Owaisi is becoming the second Zakir Naik. If he speaks more than required, then we do have law and order problem in our country," Supriyo told reporters here.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Zakir Naik is a controversial Islamic preacher. The government is seeking his extradition on charges of money laundering and hate speech.</p>
      <p>The AIMIM lawmaker came under attack after he demanded the reconstruction of Babri mosque, which was demolished by Hindu activists in 1992.</p>
      <p>"I want my masjid back," Owaisi tweeted on Friday, days after the Supreme Court ordered the construction of Ram Temple on the disputed site in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>Ending decades-long dispute, the apex court on November 6 ordered setting up a trust to construct Ram Temple and also directed the government to give 5-acre land to Muslim parties to build a mosque in Ayodhya.</p>
