      <h2>The co-founder of Microsoft has returned to the top of the world's richest person list for the first time in two years thanks to his staggering $110 billlion fortune</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:08:48+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Bill Gates has regained his position as the richest person in the world for the first time in two years.</p>
      <p>The Microsoft co-founder has found himself at the top of the charts after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' vast wealth got a little smaller.</p>
      <p>On Friday the Bloomberg Billionaire Index reported that Gates was worth a staggering $110 billion (£85 billion.)</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old's rise to the top was in part helped by the Pentagon signing a $10 billion contract with Microsoft for cloud computing services.</p>

      <p>While Gates only owns roughly 1% of the company he helped build, that is thought to be worth around $7.3 billion.</p>
      <p>The fact the Pentagon chose Microsoft over Bezos's company Amazon caused the online retailers' value to tumble by 2%.</p>
      <p>The stock market drop cause the 55-year-old's total wealth to come in at a paltry $108.7 billion.</p>

      <p>Bezos fortune took another pummeling recently when he divorced ex-wife MacKenzie, with the 49-year-old receiving a quarter of his Amazon holdings as part of the settlement.</p>
      <p>Gates would have been firmly at the top of the billionaire tree had he not given away such a large chunk of his wealth.</p>
      <p>Since 1994 he has donated more than $35 billion through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

      <p>Behind Bezos in third on the richlist is Frenchman <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/who-bernard-arnault-story-behind-14344322">Bernard Arnault</a> , chairman and CEO of Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton.</p>
      <p>He has a cool $15billion more than Berkshire Hathway's Warren Buffet in fourth and $30billion more than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> founder Mark Zuckerberg in fifth.</p>
      <p>The top ten richest people in the world - all of whom are men - have a collective fortune of $787.8billion.</p>
      <p>That equates to more than $100 for every person on Earth.</p>
