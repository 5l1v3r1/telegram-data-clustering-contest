      <h1>The dark past of an Exeter pub that has stood the test of time</h1>
      <h2>“We are the last drinks-only pub in Exwick and we’ve had to work hard to keep it open"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anita Merritt</a></address>
      <p>A pub that is used to hitting the headlines is Exwick’s The Village Inn, but thankfully not so much in recent times.</p>
      <p>Dating back to 1832, it’s little wonder there are so many tales to tell which it has been at the heart of including suicides, hangings, deaths and marriages.</p>
      <p>It is even claimed that one of the beams inside the pub came from Dartmoor Prison.</p>
      <p>Today it strives to only be at the heart of the local community by bringing people together.</p>

      <p>While many pubs are finding it harder and harder to keep trading, The Village Inn has also had its own struggles but has managed to keep going, despite the changes it has seen.</p>
      <p>Current landlords Peter and Heather Hayball have run the pub for the past 15 years and are proud to have been able to keep its doors open for so long.</p>
      <p>Peter, 53, said: “We are the last wet-led pub in Exwick and we’ve had to work hard to keep it open.</p>
      <p>"It’s hard to keep pubs full stop. It’s really difficult at the moment. What we used to find was dad’s would come in with their lads and the lads would then follow in their footsteps and take their place.</p>
      <p>“But for reasons such as social media, people don’t feel the need to come to pubs anymore to socialise because they can do it at home. They also don’t play darts and pool anymore. I remember when the queue used to be so big to play darts you had to put your name down on the board.</p>

      <p>“We call it losing people from the top down. We saw people from the cradle to the grave but unfortunately the spectrum is nearer the grave now.</p>
      <p>“What people want is different and it’s a challenge for pubs to adapt. We don’t want to put in lots of gadgets and turn the place into an arcade.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people would go to the pub after work on a Friday afternoon or at lunchtimes, but you can’t do that anymore.</p>

      <p>“We don’t get youngsters in like we used to. There used to be a lot of students living on the estate but there is now so much student accommodate near the university that they don’t have digs this side of the city anymore.</p>
      <p>“Our main clientele now is locals who live a five or 10 minute walk away. We are very much a community based pub.</p>
      <p>“We have some proper characters who drink in here and some customers who have been drinking in here for a long time.</p>
      <p>“We find it very hard to attract new people in. We get people who have been living on the estate for more than 10 years who have never been in and when they do they says it’s really good.”</p>
      <p>The pub used to belong to Exwick Manor and since becoming a watering hole has had lots to add to its fascinating history.</p>

      <p>A previous landlord who had been due to host a wrestling match there was hauled before the local board of health for trying to do it during the cholera outbreak of 1832.</p>
      <p>The pub, then known as The Lamb Inn, promised to cancel the match, but a special constable was appointed to keep a watch on the pub to make sure it complied with the order.</p>
      <p>In the past it was used as a coroner’s court following the death of a young man drowned in the River Exe by St David's Station. The week before the hearing in 1854, a wedding had taken place at the pub.</p>
      <p>Another inquest held there was a mysterious case of poisoning in 1890 when an Exwick man found his wife dead.</p>
      <p>A more happier occasion was reported when two men from Exwick who were taken prisoner by the Boers at Colenso and imprisoned at Waterval, while fighting in the Boer War. After they were released in 1907, they were treated to a welcome celebration at the pub.</p>
      <p>It was in 1987 that the Lamb's name was changed to the Village Inn.</p>
      <p>Due to its vast history, tales of ghosts have long been associated with the pub.</p>

      <p>Peter said: “Some people say they have seen ghosts in here. I’m a non-believer. Unless one taps me on the shoulder I don’t believe it’s haunted. Most old buildings have noises and as it said they used to hang people out the back, that’s where the ghost stories come from."</p>
      <p>The pub used to open during the day everyday but now only does so from Friday to Sunday. Despite the long hours, the landlords say they have enjoyed their 15 years behind the bar of the pub.</p>
      <p>Peter said: “We do it because we enjoy the job. I like meeting people.”</p>
      <p>Heather added: “For me it’s being part of the community and people look at us like that. For me that’s the best thing.</p>

      <p>“As soon as the door opens our regulars will see who it is but won’t judge and they welcome everyone – even if it’s their first time or hundredth time. People can be part of the pub or drink on their own.</p>
      <p>“We like the fact women can come in here and feel they are able to on their own as they know the people in here and don’t feel intimidated. We’re like a big family really.”</p>
      <p>What brings people together is the regular events the pub hosts. As well as having a darts and pool team, every Saturday is karaoke night.</p>
      <p>The pub also used to book live bands regularly but was unable to compete with local competition. However, now that less live music is being put on locally they have decided to give it a go again on occasional Friday nights.</p>
      <p>The pub also has it’s very own TV channel – Village Inn TV – which displays pictures taken in the pub and those submitted by locals with a weekly competition for the best one.</p>

      <p>Definitely not camera shy is three-year-old Hamish Walker who was in there with his dad Andrew who lives a stones throw away from the pub.</p>
      <p>Andrew, 43, said: “I first came in here when I was 11 years old with my dad. Then I used to come on a Friday night with a couple of friends to play darts and pool.</p>
      <p>“It’s always been a community pub and it’s not changed a great deal. It’s always been friendly and I like that I can come in here with my children. They’ve been in here since they were babies and nobody bats an eyelid.</p>
      <p>“I brought a friend in here recently after the rugby and he said there’s not many proper pubs like this anymore, and it’s true.”</p>
      <p>The same feeling is echoed by Joe Hannigan, 77, of Exwick. He said: “I’ve been coming here most days for about six or seven years because it’s close by and the bar is looked after well.</p>
      <p>“The pub is still exactly the same as it was when I first started drinking in here. The landlords are very nice and it’s a friendly pub.”</p>
      <p>Another regular is Andrew Giles, 51, of Exwick, who has been drinking at the pub for the past two years due to its close proximity to his home and the welcome he gets.</p>
      <p>He said: “I do drink in other pubs but I quite like it in here. I just come for a bit because I generally know other people. Sometimes at the weekend I stay a bit longer. I like it because there’s no fuss or bother here.”</p>
