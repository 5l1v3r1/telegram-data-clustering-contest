      <h1>FedEx Guy Throws $1,500 Canon Lens Instead of Walking 10 Feet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:35:12+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petapixel.com/author/michaelczhang/" target="_blank">Michael Zhang</a></address>
      <p>A FedEx delivery guy was caught on camera this week throwing a package containing a $1,500 Canon camera lens to a front door instead of walking a few extra steps to put it down gently. The whole thing can be seen in the 3-minute video above.<br/><br/>Florida-based photographer <a href="http://www.rieglerphoto.com/">Greg Riegler</a> shared the video online after seeing what his Nest video doorbell had captured on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The video shows a non-uniformed man stepping out of an unmarked FedEx-style truck, strolling across the lawn, and then tossing the large cardboard box toward the door before walking back. He then returns to the front door with another man who is wearing a FedEx shirt and who identifies the dropoff as a FedEx delivery.</p>
      <p>When no one comes to the door to sign for the package, the duo leaves a slip, picks up the box, and departs.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been in contact with FedEx and the local distribution center,” Riegler writes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/dwt94c/fedex_trainee_casually_tosses_my_1500_camera_lens/">on Reddit</a>. “It’s a contractor, and the guy tossing the box seems to be training, which is crazy he already doesn’t care about his job.</p>
      <p>“I know packages are supposed to be packed in a way they can handle drops and whatnot, but they shouldn’t be intentionally mishandled. Thankfully no damage to the screen door […]”</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the lens was delivered successfully the following day, and it appears to be undamaged.</p>
      <p>“A legit FedEx guy came last night to deliver it,” Riegler says. “Opened the box and inspected the lens in front of the camera after receiving, everything appears fine!</p>
      <p>“I assumed it should be packed well enough to handle stuff like this, but it shouldn’t be intentionally mishandled like that.”</p>
