      <h1>These were the 10 most-watched Disney+ shows during launch week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:37:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Meek</a></address>
      <p>Other than the streaming and log-in hiccups that frustrated some viewers who tried out the new service earlier this week, the hotly anticipated debut of Disney’s new streamer Disney+ on Tuesday seems to have been enough of a success that it reportedly garnered millions of subscribers for Disney. And it even helped the Walt Disney Co. stock price <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-stock-surges-to-record-high-on-the-eye-popping-subscription-number-for-disney-2019-11-13">reach its biggest single-day gain</a> in seven months as a result.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the new streamer has emerged as a credible threat to Netflix right out of the gate. Its monthly price starts at $6.99, and for that price you get to enjoy hundreds of movies from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and Disney, not to mention new series that will be exclusive to Disney+. Along those lines, after watching the first episode of the streamer’s new series <i>The Mandalorian</i> (with my first impressions <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-shows-mandalorian-episode-1-review/">recorded here</a>) I found it to be a fantastic addition to the Star Wars franchise.</p>
      <p>Speaking of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, which focuses on the adventures of a masked bounty hunter, it might not surprise many of you to learn that it also seems to have been the most-watched Disney+ series now that we’ve come to the end of the streamer’s debut week. That’s according to the folks at <a href="https://www.tvtime.com/"><i>TV Time</i></a>, which has a wildly popular app that’s used to track and react to TV shows and which has already started incorporated Disney+ content into the series they track week-to-week based on their users’ activity. And now that week one of Disney+ is officially in the history books, <i>TV Time</i> shared with us which series got the most love on the new service.</p>
      <p>The 10 most-watched shows on Disney+ this week:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>The Mandalorian</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>Encore!</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>The Imagineering Story</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>Forky Asks A Question</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>Pixar SparkShorts</b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>Marvel’s Hero Project </b>
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>
            <b>Pixar in Real Life</b>
          </i>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>It will be interesting to watch this going forward and to see what changes manifest themselves over time. But, as I said, it’s certainly no surprise at this point to see <i>The Mandalorian</i> at the top of the list this week (and in case anyone forgot, episode two of the series went live on Friday).</p>
