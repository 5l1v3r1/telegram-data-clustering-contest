      <p>MEXICO CITY — Tropical Storm Raymond is forecast to weaken over the Pacific as it moves toward Mexico’s resort-studded Los Cabos.</p>
      <p>The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Saturday that Raymond’s maximum sustained winds remained around 50 mph (85 kph).</p>
      <p>The storm’s centre was about 455 miles (735 kilometres) south-southwest of the tip of the Baja California Peninsula, and it was heading north at 9 mph (15 kph).</p>
      <p>The hurricane centre said Raymond should dump 3 to 5 inches of rain over southern parts of the peninsula, threatening dangerous floods.</p>
      <p>The storm was forecast to degrade into a tropical depression as it nears the area late Sunday and become a remnant low Monday.</p>
      <p>The twin cities of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo are popular beach destinations for foreign and domestic travellers.</p>
