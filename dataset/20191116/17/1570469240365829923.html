      <p>The verdict in the corruption trial of Sudan's ousted president Omar al-Bashir is to be delivered on December 14, a judge announced Saturday, as his supporters staged a  protest outside the court.</p>
      <p>Bashir, who was overthrown by the army in April, has been on trial in a Khartoum court since August on charges of illegally acquiring and using foreign funds -- offences that could land him behind bars for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>Several hearings have been held, including one on Saturday, in the presence of the deposed leader who followed the proceedings from inside a metal cage.</p>
      <p>"It has been decided that on December 14 a session will be held to deliver the verdict," judge Sadeq Abdelrahman said.</p>
      <p>Authorities seized 6.9 million euros, $351,770 and 5.7 million Sudanese pounds ($128,000) from Bashir's home, Abdelrahman said at the start of the trial in August.</p>
      <p>Bashir said at the time that the funds were the remainder of $25 million received from Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
      <p>The aid, he said, formed part of Sudan's strategic relations with Saudi Arabia and were "not used for private interests but as donations".</p>
      <p>Several defence witnesses testified in court, some backing up Bashir's account.</p>
      <p>Against the backdrop of trial in Khartoum, calls have grown from global rights groups, activists and victims of the war in Darfur to transfer Bashir to The Hague-based International Criminal Court.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'No, No to ICC'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bashir is wanted by the ICC for his alleged role in the Darfur war that broke out in 2003 as ethnic African rebels took up arms against Bashir's then Arab-dominated government, accusing it of marginalising the region economically and politically.</p>
      <p>Khartoum applied what rights groups say was a scorched earth policy against ethnic groups suspected of supporting the rebels -- raping, killing, looting and burning villages.</p>
      <p>The ICC has accused Bashir of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the vast western region of Darfur. He denies the charges.</p>
      <p>About 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million displaced in the conflict, according to the United Nations.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, dozens of Bashir's supporters carrying his portraits held a protest outside the court, vowing to oppose any move by Sudan's new authorities to hand him over to the ICC.</p>
      <p>"We are with you. We will never betray you. No, no to ICC," chanted the crowd as the former president was brought to the courthouse for the hearing.</p>
      <p>"President Bashir represents the whole of Sudan. We have an independent judiciary and if any trials are to be held, they must be held here," said demonstrator Mohamed Ali Daklai.</p>
      <p>"We reject any outside or foreign tribunal. ICC is anyway a political court used by Western countries to pressure the weak."</p>
      <p>Bashir was ousted following nationwide protests against his iron-fisted rule of three decades.</p>
      <p>The army generals who initially seized power after the president's fall refused to hand 75-year-old Bashir over to the ICC.</p>
