      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare datamine details map, mission types, more for rumored battle royale mode</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T17:47:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 17:47</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has been datamined again and the information gleaned is on the rumored battle royal mode</p>
      <p>While Infinity Ward has yet to announce a battle royale mode for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/03/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-battle-royale-datamined-rumor/">another datamine</a> has revealed that’s it apparently coming at some point.</p>
      <p>According to the datamine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/">posted by leaker Senescallo on reddit</a>, the rather large battle royale map contains 15 zones and six points of interest (thanks, <a href="https://charlieintel.com/data-miners-find-extensive-battle-royale-content-in-modern-warfare-files-including-map/58015/">CharlieIntel</a>).</p>
      <p>There’s information on default player count options (200 players) for public matches and private matches; six mission types; how Repsawn Tokens will work; and plenty of stuff on armor, loot, and perks.</p>
      <p>If you hit up the reddit link, you will see the map and the entire list of datamined information.</p>

      <p>Since battle royal mode has not been announced for the game, tuck this away as a juicy rumor to be safe.</p>
      <p>Infinity Ward has been mum regarding the mode for Modern Warfare, rumors state it will be introduced to the game <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/08/09/modern-warfare-battle-royale-rumour/">as a free, standalone download in 2020</a>. It’s also rumored the mode <a href="https://charlieintel.com/raven-software-logo-not-shown-on-modern-warfare-beta-loading-screen/56397/">is in development at Raven Software</a>, which has worked on every Call of Duty title in recent years.</p>
