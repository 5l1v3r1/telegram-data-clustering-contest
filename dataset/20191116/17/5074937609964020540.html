      <p>Akim Oda (E/R), Nov. 16, GNA - Mr Akwasi Boakye-Yiadom, the Acting Municipal Coordinator of the Birim Central National Service Personnel has advised the personnel to let the development of the country be their utmost concern in their scheme of affairs.</p>

      <p>Mr Boakye-Yiadom gave the advice when eight service personnel of the Birim Central Municipality picked forms at Akim Oda in the Eastern Region to contest the executive positions of the Birim Central branch of the National Service Personnel Association (NASPA).</p>
      <p>The positions being contested for are President, Vice-President, Financial Secretary, and Organising Secretary and the elections would take place on November 22, 2019 at the Birim Central Municipal Assembly Hall.</p>
      <p>Mr George Akomea Ankrah, an aspirant for the position of President in an interview with the Ghana News Agency said it was a great opportunity for him to contest the election and that he was hopeful to win.</p>
      <p>He encouraged his colleagues not to shy away when such chances come their way, but use to it boost their confidence.</p>
