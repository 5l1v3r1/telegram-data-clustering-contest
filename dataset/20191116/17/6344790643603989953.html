      <h1>Mark Hamill Shares Rare On-Set STAR WARS Footage of Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca Speaking His Lines</h1>

      <p>A few years ago we shared <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/hear-chewbacca-speak-english-in-behind-the-scenes-footage-from-star-wars">a video </a>from the set of <b><i>Star Wars</i></b> featuring footage of <b>Peter Mayhew</b> as Chewbacca delivering his lines to <b>Harrison Ford</b> in English. That video wasn’t the best quality and hard to hear. A new one has since surfaced that was shared by Mark Hamill where you can actually hear what Chewy is saying and there’s also another scene that’s included that I had never seen before.</p>
      <p>In the new scene, we hear Chewbacca make a comment about Obi-Wan Kenobi saying, “That old man is mad,” which puts so much context into Han's response and makes it so much more funny. I wish we had footage like this of all of Mayhew’s dialogue!</p>
      <p>Enjoy the video below!</p>
