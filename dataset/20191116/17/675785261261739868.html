      <p>Defence chiefs are set to buy a £75million laser capable of protecting the UK from a ­Russian drone swarm attack.</p>
      <p>Top brass want the state-of-the-art weapon, which can defend ­military and civilian airfields, radar dishes and combat jets from enemy strikes.</p>
      <p>It would guard against the chaos experienced at Gatwick a year ago.</p>
      <p>A source said: “The main drone threat is from China and Russia.</p>
      <p>“We know they are looking at mass drone attacks in the event of war. A single drone carrying a small explosive charge could take out a radar dish or destroy a jet.</p>
      <p>“ISIS has used crude but effective drones in Syria. They are getting smaller and more advanced.”</p>

      <p>A US computer-controlled laser located, tracked and destroyed drones in minutes during a secret US military exercise last week.</p>
      <p>The test, at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, is believed to be the first time a laser has been able to shoot down a large number of “enemy drones”.</p>
      <p>The laser – called ATHENA, or Advanced Test High Energy Asset – has been developed by aerospace giant ­Lockheed Martin.</p>
      <p>It can be fixed to a building or mounted on a vehicle so it can be moved around.</p>
      <p>The device can be fired at rockets, other vehicles, small boats – and even humans.</p>
      <p>Britain has already invested more than £130million in its own laser weapon programme.</p>
      <p>But it will not be ready for combat operations for at least 10 years, and defence sources admit a decision might be made to buy the US version.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Two weeks ago it emerged more than 150 drone attacks had been launched in the UK in three years.</p>
      <p>One source said: “Although no decision has yet been taken, it is evident 10 years is too long to wait.</p>
      <p>"We need to start looking at what we can buy off the shelf.”</p>
      <p>The Government is concerned about the threat of drone swarms against air bases, parked aircraft, missile batteries and radars.</p>
      <p>The MoD said: “Laser and radio frequency technologies have the potential to revolutionise the battlefield by offering powerful and cost-effective weapons systems to our forces.”</p>
      <p>The system may be tried out first on Navy ships and Army vehicles.</p>
