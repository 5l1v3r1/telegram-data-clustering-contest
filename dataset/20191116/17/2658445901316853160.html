      <h4>Mike Odiegwu, Yenagoa</h4>
      <p>Kinsmen of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Kolo, Ogbia Local Government Area trooped out to celebrate the defeat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ward 9.</p>
      <p>They took over the road leading to Ogbia Town immediately the results of the 13 units in Ward 9 were announced by electoral officials and APC was declared the winner of the ward.</p>
      <p>Some of them flew the flag of APC while others used their brooms to sweep the road saying they had suffered under the current PDP government.</p>

      <p>Some of them said they were given as much as N10,000 but that they rejected the money because they were United and determined to vote out PDP.</p>
      <p>“We are happy because we won the PDP in all the units” one of them, who failed to mention his name out of excitement said.</p>
      <p>Also in Eppie-Atissa in Yenagoa, residents took over the road jubilating over the defeat of the PDP in the area.</p>
