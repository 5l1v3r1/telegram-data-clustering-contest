        <b>Councils in England made a total of £930m from parking activities in a year, figures show.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The record figure during the past financial year is a 7% increase on 2017-18, the RAC Foundation says.</p>
      <p>Seventeen of the 20 councils making the most money are in London, with Westminster Council accruing the largest amount, at £69m.</p>
      <p>Brighton and Hove, Birmingham and Milton Keynes were the only three in the top 20 not in the capital.</p>
      <p>Kensington and Chelsea was second in London, with a total of £37m.</p>
      <p>Any money made from parking activities - which includes fines and tickets - must be spent on local transport projects.</p>
      <h3>'Keep traffic moving'</h3>
      <p>The study was carried out by transport consultant David Leibling, who analysed Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government data.</p>
      <p>Local authorities received an income of £1.746bn from their parking operations in 2018-19, which included £454m from penalties, which is up 6% year-on-year.</p>
      <p>The amount councils spent on running their day-to-day parking operations was £816m, not including interest payments or depreciation of assets such as car parks.</p>
      <p>David Renard, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said London had the highest number of vehicles moving about looking for spaces to park.</p>
      <p>"I would expect the higher volume of vehicles moving around London means there'll be a higher level of infringement and fines," he said.</p>
      <p>"[Councils] seek to ensure they can keep the traffic moving as efficiently as possible and that means people who infringe the regulations will get fined," he said.</p>
