      <p>It's common knowledge that <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29768790/meghan-markle-rare-photo-before-royal/">Meghan Markle</a> is practically perfect in every way, but even a real-life Poppins like the <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29558284/meghan-markle-prince-harry-couple-in-love/">Duchess of Sussex</a> has certain features that just stand out. For Meghan, her bold, impeccably-shaped brows have always been on that list.</p>
      <p>If you've ever caught yourself <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a26052199/meghan-markle-eyebrows-trend/">lusting for Duchess brows</a> of your very own, you're in luck because Meghan's longtime friend and personal makeup artist, <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a28954139/meghan-markle-makeup-artist-daniel-martin-birthday/">Daniel Martin</a>, is not treating the trick to achieving them like a state secret.</p>
      <p>Martin appeared on <a href="https://www.itv.com/lorraine">ITV's </a><i><a href="https://www.itv.com/lorraine">Lorraine</a></i> this week, where he explained the tricks behind Meghan's brows, as well as his own top dos and don'ts for maintaining perfect arches yourself.</p>
      <p>First off, Martin said that people need to treat their eyebrows "as sisters not twins," meaning that perfect symmetry doesn't need to be the end goal (which is a huge relief, since trying to achieve perfect brow balance is an embarrassing moment from a rom-com waiting to happen), and reminded viewers that eyebrows frame the face—meaning they have a big impact on your overall beauty look.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the tips Martin, who famously did <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a22044663/meghan-markle-emojis-royal-wedding/">Meghan's makeup (brows included) for her royal wedding</a> to Prince Harry in May 2018, shared during the segment:</p>
      <h3>Focus on structure and fullness:</h3>
      <p>"As we age we tend to loose out eyebrows a bit," he explained, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7689285/Meghan-Markles-make-artist-Daniel-Martin-shows-viewers-achieve-perfect-eyebrows.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a>. "So what we want to do, is we want to enhance her brow and really figure out that structure, really figure out those holes and spots that we lost."</p>
      <h3>Go against the grain:</h3>
      <p>Martin's personal product pick when it comes to brows? Brow gel. He didn't endorse a specific brand, but Gimme Brow from Benefit Cosmetics is a good place to start if you're just journeying into the world of brow gel:</p>
      <p>Martin explained that the key to making the most of brow gel is to apply it against the growth of the hair for a optimum brow game.</p>
      <h3>Add eyeshadow:</h3>
      <p>Your brow-perfecting kit should include more that just brow-specific products. Martin suggests keeping a neutral eyeshadow palette on hand and applying a lighter shade of powder just below the brow for a fuller look.</p>
      <p>"So when you go in, go one shade lighter and just fill it in," he explained.</p>
      <h3>And hairspray:</h3>
      <p>Finally, Martin proved that hairspray is handy for keeping your brows in place—which makes sense, considering they <i>are</i> hair. To apply hairspray to your brows to extend the life of their perfection, spray the product on a mascara spoolie and use that to lightly brush the hairspray onto your brows.</p>
      <p>"I feel like once you get to a place with your brow you can use a setting. I have a friend who puts hair spray on a mascara spoolie and finishes off her brow like that," he said.</p>
      <h3>Beware tweezers:</h3>
      <p>There's nothing inherently wrong with thin '90s brows, but they're not the look Martin is going for.</p>
      <p>"So one mistake a lot of people make is over-tweezing or over-plucking your brows," he said. "When that happens you want to find something that you can easily go in to apply but you don’t want to re-shape or re-structure your brow."</p>
      <p>Sounds simple enough.</p>
