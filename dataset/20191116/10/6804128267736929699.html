      <h1>West Ham's international stars get much-needed minutes and confidence boosting results</h1>
      <h2>Plenty of Hammers players were in action for their country across the last couple of days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:26:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham's international stars have been in action over the past three days and for the majority of them, there were some good results and a much-needed minutes for some players as well.</p>
      <p>Winston Reiid continued his comeback from injury as he featured for New Zealand while Arthur Masuaku, rarely seen in clarent and blue since his sending off against Aston Villa, got 90 minutes under his belt.</p>
      <p>Albian Ajeti played 71 minutes for Switzerland as they saw off a resilient Georgia side 1-0 in St Gallen on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Ajeti, who has yet to start a Premier League game for West Ham since making an Â£8m move to east London from Basel, was replaced by Cedric Itten who would score the only goal of the game six minutes later.</p>
      <p>Switzerland are one point behind Denmark in their group but two ahead of Ireland heading into their final qualifier against Gibraltar next week when Ajeti is likely to get another start against the minnows.</p>
      <p>Six other Hammers players were in action for their country on Thursday and there were some much-needed confidence boosting results.</p>
      <p>Fabian Balbuena played the full 90 minutes for Paraguay and kept a clean sheet as well as the Albirroja beat Bulgaria 1-0 in Sofia. Balbuena's side play Saudi Arabia in their second friendly of the break on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Andriy Yarmolenko got what, for Ukraine anyway, his customary hour or so of action as he played 66 minutes of their 1-0 win over Estonia in Zaporizhia. Ukraine have already qualified for Euro 2020 and have one more game to go, away to Serbia on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Winston Reid played 45 minutes for New Zealand in their 3-1 defeat to Ireland on Thursday as the defender continued his comeback from 19 months on the sidelines through injury.</p>
      <p>The defender has been released from the squad as part of an arranged agreement between the Kiwi's and West Ham and Reid will not be in their squad for the friendly match with Lithuania.</p>
      <p>In the same game Reid played, midfielder Josh Cullen starred for the Irish in their victory.</p>
      <p>Over in Africa, Arthur Masuaku got some much-needed minutes under his belt, something he has been lacking recently as DR Congo played out a 0-0 draw with Gabon as the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying stage got underway.</p>
