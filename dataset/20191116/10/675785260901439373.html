      <h2>Tina Simmons, from Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, was set to marry her fiancé Martin Simmons in Cuba next year before a freak work accident left him with brain damage</h2>

      <p>A bride-to-be donned her wedding dress during a bedside blessing for her fiancé after a work accident left him with severe brain damage a year before their dream wedding in Cuba.</p>
      <p>Tyre recycler Martin Simmons, from the Forest of Dean, Gloucs, was left disabled after his arm was allegedly caught in a conveyor belt at work earlier this year, which crushed the main artery in his neck.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old had proposed to fiancée Tina Simmons, 35, in November 2017, and the pair had been due to fly to Cuba with five guests for their dream wedding in April 2020.</p>
      <p>But after Martin was left on life support in hospital for two weeks with no chance of recovery, Tina put on her lace, sparkly gown for a hospital ceremony just four days before he passed away on March 6 this year with Tina by his side.</p>

      <p>Former café worker and mum-of-two Tina, also from the Forest of Dean, is now speaking out for the first time to keep stepdad-of-two Martin's memory alive.</p>
      <p>She said: “Marrying him was one of the last promises I made to Martin, so I had to make it happen.</p>
      <p>“It was the perfect day. Martin’s best friend read out the vows on his behalf and my son, Tommy, placed the ring on my finger.</p>
      <p>“The following night I got onto bed with Martin and cuddled up with him for an hour or so. The nurse put on some music quietly and we we’re left to have a little sleep.</p>
      <p>"That was the first time I’d been able to put my head on his chest since the day of the accident and I listened to him breathe.</p>
      <p>“It was the most perfect cuddle despite the constant noises coming from the various machines.</p>

      <p>Childhood sweethearts Martin and Tina first met when they were 12 years old and rekindled their romance three years ago when they bumped into each other on the bus.</p>
      <p>Tina said: “He was my best friend and soulmate. We grew up together as kids and I gave into his cute but constant nagging to agree to be his girlfriend at around 12 years old.</p>
      <p>“I moved away a few months later, but we stayed in touch. About three years ago we bumped back into each other on the bus.</p>
      <p>“We decided to go for drinks and food. We got talking for a few days and he moved in pretty much straight away.”</p>

      <p>On February 20, Martin's arm allegedly got caught in a conveyor belt while working on a newly installed tyre shredding machine, which put pressure on his neck.</p>
      <p>Tina said that although his colleagues attempted CPR whilst waiting for paramedics, he’d already been without oxygen for too long when they arrived.</p>
      <p>The accident is currently being investigated by police and the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
      <p>Martin spent two weeks in Southmead Intensive Care Unit in Bristol where Tina and Martin's mum, Janet, would sing their favourite songs to him, but he was brain damaged with no chance of recovery.</p>
      <p>After telling a nurse about their plan to get hitched in Cuba, Tina organised a bedside blessing with a cake donated by friends and a bouquet and buttonholes made by the receptionist.</p>
      <p>When doctors advised Martin wouldn’t wake up, his bride-to-be and his mum made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support and he died two days later.</p>
      <p>Tina said even though the marriage wasn't technically official, she still sees herself as Martin's wife and took on his surname after he died.</p>

      <p>She added: “Martin had such a zest for life. He was a family man, very close to his family. He worked tirelessly to give us a comfortable life.</p>
      <p>“We had so many plans and dreams and his passion was work. It was his love for working that killed him. During his time in hospital, he fought so hard but we knew he was getting weaker.</p>
      <p>“I dozed off for about an hour holding his hand and when I woke up he took one last breath. I honestly think he waited for me and I do take some comfort in that.</p>
      <p>“It was the hardest conversation I’ve ever had to make the decision to remove his life support. But it was all very dignified and the staff were so sensitive and helped us through each step.”</p>
      <p>Tina said she has being going through hell since the day of Martin’s accident and has given away her £1,500 wedding dress as it was too painful to look at – to another bride whose fiancé is also named Martin.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve given a bride who on a budget a dress. It went to a lady who’s fiancé is also called Martin so it felt right.</p>
      <p>“We’re friends now and she’s going to send me photos of her special day when they get married next year. My Martin would help anyone, so I know this is right.</p>
      <p>“I’ve received so many messages of support and it’s pushed me into wanting to tell our story and keep Martin’s memory alive.</p>
      <p>“It’s all still very raw and the grieving is coming in huge waves but I have a fantastic family and close friends helping me through this hell.”</p>
