      <p>Members of United Auto Workers have approved a new labor agreement with auto giant Ford, the union announced late Friday.</p>
      <p>A preliminary agreement was announced on October 31, which averted a strike similar to the one at General Motors.</p>
      <p>The new four-year contract includes a bonus of $9,000 for <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/full-time/">full-time</a> union workers at Ford, bonuses linked to performance and two annual increases of three percent, UAW said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Rory Gamble, UAW vice president in charge of the negotiations, said the deal would be "a life-changing contract for many and provides a template for all future Ford UAW members to a full-time, top-rate status."</p>
      <p>"There will be no more permanent temporary situations and no more permanent tiers."</p>
      <p>By the end of October, Gamble had indicated that the preliminary agreement was modeled on the new GM work contract, announced shortly before.</p>
      <p>After forty days of unprecedented strike action, GM and UAW reached an <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/agreement/">agreement</a> providing for <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/wage+increases/">wage increases</a>, an $11,000 signing bonus and $7.7 billion additional investment in US plants.</p>
