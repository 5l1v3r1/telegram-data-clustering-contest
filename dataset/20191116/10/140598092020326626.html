      <h1>Club record attendances predicted for Women's Football Weekend as interest in women's game continues to grow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:45:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-morgan/" target="_blank">Tom Morgan</a></address>
      <p>Women's Super League matches could welcome up to tenfold increases in average attendances on Sunday, with four matches staged at major stadiums to seize upon the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/message-never-seen-womens-football-go-watch-whole-perception/">explosion of interest</a> in the Lionesses since the World Cup.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are understood to be hopeful of achieving a crowd of up to 20,000 against Everton at Anfield, while Tottenham, also in derby action against Arsenal, are also predicted to land their highest ever attendance for a women's match.</p>
      <p>The two giants, along with Reading and Brighton, who are also hosting games at the Madejski and Amex stadiums, all told the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> there is now genuine business incentive to commit similar matchday budgets as would be expected for men's senior games.</p>
      <p>A WSL record of 31,213 when Manchester City hosted rivals Manchester United at Etihad Stadium in September has already helped overall crowd averages grow to 4,112, up from under 1,000 last season.</p>
      <p>However, the league is particular desperate to maintain momentum after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/09/england-vs-germany-international-friendly-live-score-latest/">77,768 packed Wembley</a> to watch England's women defeated in a friendly against Germany last weekend. To put that in context, the men's match against Montenegro on Thursday drew a smaller audience of 77,277.</p>
      <p>Anfield announced that "few tickets remain" in the areas allocated for Sunday's fixture, while Tottenham described this weekend as a "landmark moment in women’s football in this country".</p>
      <p>The growing popularity for the women's game comes despite some mixed results from England since their heartbreaking Women's World Cup semi-final defeat against the United States attracted a peak TV audience of more than 11.7million.</p>
      <p>Both Spurs and Liverpool are understood to be staging stewarding and security operations that could cost even more than an average Premier League match day.</p>
      <p>Liverpool has committed extra stewards in and around the ground due to the numbers visiting Anfield for the very first time, while Tottenham are throwing open their doors for extended periods before and after kick off.</p>
      <p>In a bid to maximise interest for newcomers, fans in North London can meet Ledley King, along with current Tottenham Hotspur Women players Jess Naz and Sophie Mclean for hours prior to kick off. Supporters are also invited to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after full-time to watch the England men's side in action against Kosovo in the stadium bars.</p>

      <p>The LFC Foundations has offered tickets to schools and junior teams  to generate bigger crowds. Overall sales projections have already exceeded 15,000. "Our crowd at Prenton Park for Liverpool Women this season have ranged from around 900 to 1,500 so obviously you can see the Anfield effect and the Merseyside derby effect," a club source said. "About 1,800 attended our last derby at Prenton Park on the last day of last season in May."</p>
      <p>Brighton - who play Birmingham - were offering multiple free tickets for season-ticket holders to maximise their opportunities for bumper crowds.</p>
      <p>Reading - which has seen crowds as low as 800 this season - recognised "attendance is something that has been a bit of a struggle" as home games have been played in Wycombe. However, the club said "a lot of effort" has gone into marketing Sunday's match against Bristol City at the Madejski in a bid to put the club back on the map. "Estimated attendance is tricky, but I would hope at  around 1,500 to 2,000," the club said.</p>
