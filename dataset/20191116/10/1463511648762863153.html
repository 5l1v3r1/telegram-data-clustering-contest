      <h1>Election: Heavy security presence greets major junctions in Yenagoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:02:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Security personnel have mounted checkpoints  in major junctions in Yenagoa, the capital of Bayelsa, as the state votes to elect its governor, News Agency of Nigeria reports.</p>
      <p>Checks around the city showed heavy security presence at Imgbi, Opolo, Akenfa, Igbogene Okarki and gateway junctions.</p>
      <p>Also heavily manned is the Tombia Roundabout, a location within the town that hosts major transport companies and motor parks.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that although these junctions were barricaded, security agents on duty were not seen harassing road users.</p>
      <p>Some residents who spoke to NAN said that the presence of security agents had rekindled hopes that voters would be safe to exercise their franchise.</p>
      <p>One of them, Henry Onari, a civil servant, commended the security personnel for their civility and peaceful conduct.</p>
      <p>“I have not seen them harassing anybody, they are merely searching vehicles not marked for election duty, this is a good development,’’ Onari said.</p>
      <p>Another resident, Leader Ndutimi, described the security checks at the junctions as a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“It is an election day, we don’t expect free movement, thoroughness is expected of the security agencies, and that is what we are seeing,’’ Ndutimi said.</p>
      <p>Nengi Tomprenbofa, a nurse, said the screening of vehicles and other road users by security agents was commendable.</p>
      <p>“These checkpoints are in order, you can see that people are already beginning to regain confidence, I am happy with the situation,’’ Tomprenbofa said. </p>
