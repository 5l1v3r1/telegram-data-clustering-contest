      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:00:34+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>Ex-captain Sam Warburton and former international Byron Hayward are joining the Wales backroom team under new head coach Wayne Pivac, it was announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>Hayward will be defence coach and Warburton will be a technical advisor for breakdown/defence.</p>
      <p>The defensive pair join Stephen Jones, Jonathan Humphreys and Neil Jenkins in the coaching team, with all five of Pivac’s assistants former Wales internationals. Three are former captains.</p>
      <p>Warburton played 74 Tests for Wales and led his country more times than any other Welshman. He also led the British and Irish Lions on two tours.</p>
      <p>He retired in July 2018 at the age of 29 following a string of injuries.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to bring both Byron and Sam into the set-up and add to what is already a vastly experienced coaching team,” said Pivac.</p>
      <p>“Byron has a great coaching CV with experience in England, the club game in Wales, the age-grade system and his five successful years with the Scarlets,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Sam is one of the most experienced leaders in rugby with excellent knowledge and communication skills and having only recently retired he has a full grasp on the international game.”</p>
      <p>Warburton said he was delighted to be part of the coaching team.</p>
      <p>“It is a genuine privilege to be considered for such a role and I can’t wait to do my utmost to contribute to help improve the team and players,” he said.</p>
      <p>New Zealander Pivac replaced Warren Gatland as head coach after the World Cup in Japan, where Wales reached the semi-finals.</p>
