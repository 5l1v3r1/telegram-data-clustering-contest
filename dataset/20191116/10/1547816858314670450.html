      <p>Recently, Grammy award-winning rapper Kanye West took everyone by surprise when the singer made a stop at the Harris County Jail on Friday. It was said to be a secret concert for the inmates in the jail which was put together by the help of one or two people. According to a TMZ source, Kanye and the team stayed for a couple of hours and performed for a select group of prisoners and staff members. West had earlier performed a gig for the prisoners in Texas and this time he decided to bring the soulful sounds to Houston jail.</p>
      <p>For this secret concert, the star rapper-turned-gospel singer performed songs from his new gospel album Jesus is King. He and his choir performed for more than 200 male inmates at the jail. In the video, Kanye is seen performing with full enthusiasm by bringing some light and church service to people who needed this.</p>
