      <p>Newcastle Jets have delivered a mighty upset to secure their first A-League win of the season, defeating Western United 1-0 in Geelong.</p>
      <p>Newcastle deservedly took the lead after 36 minutes through 19-year-old striker Angus Thurgate and while United grew into the game, they were unable to find a response at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>United were bolstered by Besart Berisha’s return, while Josh Risdon made it back from international duty in time to start, but Panagiotis Kone was missing with a hamstring injury.</p>

      <p>In Kone’s absence United struggled to control the midfield, with industrious Newcastle duo Steven Ugarkovic and Ben Kantarovski keeping the Jets ticking over.</p>
      <p>On a number of occasions the bustling Jets were able to win possession and create a numerical advantage on the counter - only to stumble at the final hurdle with poor decisions going forward.</p>
      <p>Scott McDonald was impressive for United early, consistently drifting into dangerous positions and creating a couple of good chances while Alessandro Diamanti was typically dynamic on the ball.</p>

      <p>But Newcastle’s Thurgate came closest to opening the scoring in the 31st minute when his skidding shot just inside the box forced a difficult diving save from Filip Kurto.</p>
      <p>Five minutes later, it would be Thurgate who broke the deadlock.</p>
      <p>Matt Millar found Thurgate, who showed some terrific hold-up play to one-touch the ball to Dimi Petratos and continue his run. Petratos fed a well-weighted ball back through to Thurgate, who slid a delightful finish past Kurto for his second career A-League goal.</p>

      <p>United were better in the second half, with Diamanti consistently threatening to equalise, but he was unable to find the back of the net.</p>

      <p>Risdon looked to have equalised in the 70th minute when Diamanti cut inside the left flank onto his right foot and sent a curling ball to the back post for the defender to head home, but the goal was ruled out after a VAR review showed Berisha had been offside in the build-up.</p>
      <p>From there, the Jets would hold on for a gutsy victory.</p>
