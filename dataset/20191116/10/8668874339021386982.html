      <h1>Rugby player banned for life for on-field attack on referee</h1>

      <p>A South <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/otago">Otago</a> rugby player has been banned from playing the sport in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> after punching a referee.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Vaea Uelese was playing for Crescent’s senior team on July 27 when he was sent off by referee Brandon Hale.</p>
      <p>According to New Zealand media reports, the Crescent player didn’t agree with the call and took out his anger on Hale by throwing a punch.</p>
      <p>The incident was captured in a grainy video from the sideline.</p>

      <p>The New Zealand Herald reported that the violent act took place towards the end of a club game against Strath Taieri in Middlemarch.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the game, the Crescent player was charged with assault by police.</p>
      <p>But Uelese walked away from the criminal justice system without any assault charge.</p>
      <p>The Otago Rugby Football Union confirmed yesterday Uelese would not play rugby in New Zealand again.</p>
      <p>However, the Dunedin District Court confirmed that Uelese will be allowed to be involved in administration, officiating or coaching after the end of next season, partly due to a reconciliation process he had with referee Hale.</p>
