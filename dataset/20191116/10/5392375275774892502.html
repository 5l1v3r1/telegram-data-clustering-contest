      <h1>Lenovo Will Launch Only 5G Smartphones In China From Now On</h1>

      <p>Yesterday, Chen Jin, general manager of Lenovo China Business Department <a href="https://m.ithome.com/html/457420.htm">issued a statement</a>. He said that from now on, Lenovo will launch 5G smartphones. As the original slogan is ‘All in 5G in China’, it leaves room for some other assumptions. Say, we can think the Lenovo smartphones designed for the non-Chinese market can still support 4G.</p>
      <p>As many other media representatives and analysts think, this does not mean that Lenovo will stop selling 4G smartphones from now on. But, Chen Jin gave an approximate timetable in the interview: ‘In the first half of next year, we should not have 4G inventory.’</p>
      <p>The Lenovo executive also said that the company’s 4G inventory is really not much. So a more aggressive price policy will help them empty the storages quickly. ‘But it is also unlikely that we will fill our storages with a number of 5G models overnight.’ He means that though Lenovo is going to fully focus on 5G smartphones in the future, the 4G products are still actual. ‘As I said, the Chinese smartphone market next year will be roughly the same with a market capacity of 400 million units. It’s estimated there will be shipped over 150 million 5G handsets. Thus, there is still 250 million 4G demand. So the Chinese consumer market is still diversified.’</p>
