      <p>Residents in Woodthorpe were worried their dog had been stolen when he was reported missing after a burglary at their home.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Police were called at around 2.25pm on Thursday, November 14 to a report of a burglary on Beck Hill Road in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Woodthorpe</a>, where the family dog, a cockapoo, was initially thought to have been taken.</p>
      <p>Appeals for the missing dog were posted on social media.</p>
      <p>Officers were updated later that day, just before 10pm, that the dog had been found and is thought to have escaped after the offender left the door open.</p>
      <p>The dog and owners have now been reunited.</p>
      <p>Inspector Chris Pearson, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">neighbourhood policing inspector</a> for Gedling, said: "It's fantastic news that the dog and owners have been reunited and we wanted to update and thank the community for coming together, sharing the appeals and ultimately finding the dog.</p>
      <p>"To not only come home to a burgled house, but also find the beloved family pet missing must have been heartbreaking for the owners, so we were very happy to get this update and hear that the dog is back home and safe.</p>
      <p>"Tackling burglary is a priority for us on the neighbourhood policing team and we'd like to reassure people that reports such as these will be investigated and such actions will not be tolerated."</p>
