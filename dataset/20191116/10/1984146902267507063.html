      <p>Agents and intermediaries gearing up for January business believe Newcastle United will be one of the busier top flight clubs in the next transfer window.</p>
      <p>The word on the transfer market grapevine is that Newcastle are looking to strengthen in a couple of positions if there’s a deal that works for them. Central midfield and attacking positions are being targeted with third parties trying to push players to the club’s hierarchy and Steve Bruce, who brings his own set of contacts and recommendations to the table after a summer window in which his role was more to rubber stamp arrivals who had been teed up months before he arrived.</p>
      <p>“Newcastle’s one of the clubs whose name is coming up,” said one agent of the early January buzz.</p>
      <p>Newcastle have money to spend and although Bruce is playing it very cautiously – the polar opposite of his predecessor Rafa Benitez who liked to crank up the pressure on the hierarchy in the weeks before the transfer windows – he is hopeful of bringing a couple of players in “if the deal is right”.</p>

      <p>While it is a difficult window to do business in, Newcastle have played it well in the last two seasons with campaign-turning signings Kenedy and Miguel Almiron.</p>
      <p>And there is money to spend again and Bruce would be backed if the club was in dire need of reinforcements to aid their survival fight. But if the club’s improved form holds, they are going into the window in a position of strength which will dictate a few moves.</p>
      <p>United have big decisions to make on a number of their players with January seen as a crucial month for Dwight Gayle, who has 18 months left on his deal and is probably the club’s most saleable asset.</p>
      <p>West Brom retain an interest but Gayle turned down a loan because he wanted certainty over his future. He knows that his value and potential to pull in big wages could be at its height in the summer and he is a hot property for ambitious Championship sides.</p>
      <p>Newcastle are looking to the Championship and Ligue 1 and Hull’s Jarrod Bowen is certainly one of the names on their list.</p>

      <p>Sources close to Orlegi Group told Chronicle Live there was 'nothing at this time' when asked to respond to claims that a takeover was close.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, those based in Mexico say that the reports in the Athletic barely made an impact, and were were not picked up by the press in the country.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the group still holds a desire to move into Europe, and Newcastle are very much on their radar but whether things - i.e the richness of funds - has changed to allow the company to finally complete the purchase remains to be seen. (AM)</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Those national reports <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-gossip-mexican-business-17234967">linking The Orlegi Group with a takeover at Newcastle United</a> didn’t exactly capture the imagination on Tyneside</p>
      <p>It’s fair to say the Mexican consortium have invested considerable time and some finance in investigating the possibility of a Newcastle takeover. But it’s not close and United don’t currently expect any bids – even if Peter Kenyon’s partnership with GACP Sports continues to try and drum up funds and interest.</p>
      <p>If they did meet with Ashley they have got further than one group, who were told the owner’s lawyers are dealing with expressions of interest until parties can pass the club’s internal due diligence (which has surely been refined following the Bin Zayed Group’s farcical attempt to buy the club in the summer).</p>
      <p>One takeover watcher said with six weeks until the January transfer window, any deal is highly unlikely this season and Newcastle’s hierarchy are working on possible deals with no knowledge of anything being imminent.</p>

      <p>Newcastle’s hierarchy will be tested by Steve Bruce’s enthusiastic interest in a January loan move for Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>The Gunners midfielder is seen as an ideal and ready-made fit for the United engine room by Bruce, who believes United need a physical presence in midfield with experience at the top level to lift the level of his younger players.</p>
      <p>Bruce would have kept Mo Diame if he’d been in place when contract decisions were made and Newcastle are scouting for players in that mould. <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-interested-ibrahima-sissoko-17169737">Ibrahima Sissoko has been mentioned</a> but Bruce has let it be known that he feels he could turn Xhaka’s untenable situation at Arsenal to Newcastle’s advantage – and the player would be open to the move.</p>
      <p>But Xhaka is 27, is on huge wages and a loan move would be costly and a short-term fix, so doesn’t tick any of the boxes that would usually get a deal such as that green lighted.</p>
      <p>Bruce may hope to persuade the board but previous managers Rafa Benitez, Alan Pardew and Steve McClaren all ran into problems attempting the same thing. Mike Ashley likes Bruce, of course, and the power brokers have been impressed with the way Bruce has handled a difficult succession, so an exception could be made – and it would be a sign of their faith in him if it was.</p>

      <p>Newcastle United will hope that Elias Sorensen’s next Carlisle manager sees more in him than Steven Pressley, who lost his job this week with the Cumbrians precariously placed.</p>
      <p>The Magpies <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/elias-sorensen-newcastle-united-carlisle-17180972">are unhappy with the amount of game time Sorensen has had</a> – just as they were when he went to Blackpool last season. And they know that his development needs first team minutes.</p>
      <p>One option is for him to go abroad and teams in his native Denmark have expressed an interest if he’s recalled in January. It is a big call for loan manager Shola Ameobi.</p>
