      <h1>Great Britain suffer tour whitewash as Papua New Guinea inflict defeat on sorry tourists</h1>

      <p>Of all the indignities heaped on Great Britain during a disastrous tour, this shock defeat which completed a four-nil whitewash was the most humiliating.</p>
      <p>Losses at the hands of a Tonga Invitational XIII and New Zealand, twice, had already raised serious questions over <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-league/2019/11/10/great-britains-latest-defeat-raises-questions-wayne-bennetts/">Wayne Bennett’s future as head coach,</a> but this was as bad as it gets.</p>
      <p>Bennett’s team led 10-0 but shipped a long-range try before the interval and then promptly capitulated, conceding four unanswered scores in an abject second-half surrender in Port Moresby.</p>
      <p>The Lions were revived after a 12-year absence for this tour and Bennett, the England coach, was tasked with leading the re-emergence of a once iconic brand.</p>
      <p>Now, though, the Rugby Football League, who have employed him for the past four years, will come under huge pressure to not renew the veteran Australian's contract which has now expired.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know, but my contract is up now so we’ll wait and see,” said Bennett when asked about his future afterwards. “We’ll have some discussions but tonight is not a good night to make decisions.</p>
      <p>“You’re emotional and not in a good place and coaching has taught me that much; don't make decisions within 24 hours and, after a Grand Final loss, within about six weeks. I still have the appetite for it, but it's not my decision.”</p>
      <p>Tries from Blake Austin and Josh Hodgson appeared to have put Great Britain in control, despite the early loss of James Graham to a head knock.</p>
      <p>But the Kumuls hit back through Edwin Ipape and then destroyed their visitors in the second half with further tries from Justin Olam, Watson Boas, Alex Johnston and Nixon Putt.</p>
      <p>It was only Great Britain's second-ever loss to Papua New Guinea and Bennett reflected: “I'm disappointed that we've underachieved and not had a great tour.”</p>
      <p>With an Ashes series against Australia on home soil next year and a home World Cup in 2021, RFL bosses have a huge decision to make about whether to stick with Bennett as England coach or find a new man elsewhere. </p>
