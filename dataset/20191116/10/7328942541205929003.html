      <p>Real-life Iron Man Richard Browning of Gravity Industries made headlines two years ago when he set the world record for human flight at <b>51.53 km/h (32.02 mph)</b>. Since then, he has gone on to perfect his suit and even <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/you-can-now-buy-your-own-iron-man-suit-from-selfridges-for-443000">sell it</a> at Selfridges. </p>
      <p>Now, he is back to break yet another record; his own. He achieved the fastest speed in a body-controlled jet engine powered suit (wind-guided) at <b>136.891 km/h (85.06 mph)</b>. </p>
      <p>That is more than double the speed he had previously achieved. He made this record-breaking flight on <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gwrday">Guinness' World Records Day</a>. </p>
      <p>"I'm really pleased," he said afterwards according to <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/11/real-life-iron-man-smashes-his-jet-powered-suit-record-by-flying-at-85-mph"><i>Guinness World Records</i></a>. "I was confident we should be able to do it but that’s very different to coming here and actually achieving it, especially when we make our lives complicated by putting several other pilots up as well.</p>
      <p>"You can never discount the possibility of having a technical problem, so I’m really pleased we’ve delivered what we’ve done. And that is indeed the fastest I’ve ever gone. In training we were doing about 75 mph so that’s significantly faster.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t think we’d break what we did in training so I’m very chuffed."</p>
