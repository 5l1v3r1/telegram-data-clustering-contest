      <h2>Oil from the scalp becomes fluid at warmer temperatures and, with sweat, moves further down to make the roots look greasy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:23:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/lifestyle-desk/" target="_blank">Lifestyle Desk</a></address>
      <p>When you wrap yourself to keep warm, you tend to sweat more, making the hair appear oilier than usual. Oil from the scalp becomes fluid at warmer temperatures and, with sweat, move further down to make the roots look greasy.</p>
      <p>It can also lead to a dandruff flare-up, since the warmer it is around the scalp, the perfect it is for dandruff-causing microbes to thrive. Washing the hair less also leads to a much oilier scalp. In winters especially, the scalp continuously makes oil, every hour of the day, and  without shampoo, excess oil accumulates, and so do the dirt and dust particles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>For oily hair, use these things:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Acai berries: Full of folic acid, zinc, and vitamins A, C, E, and B, acai berries keep your scalp healthy and balanced.</p>
      <p>Chamomile: Look to chamomile extract in your products as a gentle, nourishing cleanser that strengthens your hair from within.</p>
      <p>Green tea: Another ingredient that works wonders with balancing your hair and scalp’s moisture levels, green tea can reduce sebum production.</p>
      <p>Marshmallow root: With its soothing and antibacterial properties, marshmallow root can restore your scalp, while also gently softening your hair.</p>
      <p>Keratin and other proteins: If your ends are dry, use a keratin-infused product to strengthen and restore your hair.</p>
