      <p>KIRKSVILLE, Mo. â€” As the deer firearm season officially gets underway this weekend, many hunters will be out and about around the state of Missouri trying to harvest the biggest buck.</p>
      <p>During this weekend, hunters were required to have any harvested deer sampled for chronic wasting disease (CWD) if they were hunting in one of the 29 counties that are part of the CWD Management Zone around the state.</p>
      <p>CWD is a deadly, infectious disease in white-tailed deer and other members of the deer family that eventually kills all animals that it infects.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/">Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC)</a>, there have been 116 cases of CWD in Missouri since 2012 out of more than 100,000 deer sampled.</p>
      <p>There have yet to be any reported cases of CWD infecting people, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highly recommends having deer tested for CWD.</p>
      <p>Missouri Department of Conservations Wildlife Management Biologist Darlene Bryant spoke with KTVO to give us a better understanding of why it is so important for the spread of CWD to be contained and how the hunters are helping reduce the spread of CWD.</p>
      <blockquote>"It helps us to early detect the disease and early detection is important because we know where to try to remove more deer so the disease is contained or helps reduce the spread. We expect to have probably between 500-600 deer during this weekend so that will take a nice sample out of our management zone in Adair County," Bryant said.</blockquote>
