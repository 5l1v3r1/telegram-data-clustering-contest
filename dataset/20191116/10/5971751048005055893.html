      <p>Besides the <a href="https://nokiamob.net/2019/11/15/nokia-6-1-got-support-for-google-assistants-ambient-mode/">Nokia 6.1</a>, other Nokia smartphones with Android One also started receiving a new feature related to Google Assistant. The Ambient Mode was announced with the Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2 in September, as a timed exclusive in the smartphone market, and this week Google started releasing it to more devices.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.nokioteca.net/blog/2019/11/su-nokia-9-pureview-arriva-la-ambient-mode-lavete-ricevuta-anche-voi/">Nokioteca.net reported</a>, the new feature is available for the Nokia 9 PureView, Nokia 8.1 and Nokia 7.1, as far as they can confirm. The Ambient Mode is probably rolling out to other Nokia smartphones and smartphones from other manufacturers as well.</p>
      <p>If your device received the new feature, do leave a comment so we can update the article. üôÇ</p>
