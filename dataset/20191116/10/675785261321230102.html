      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/take-me-out">Take Me Out</a> contestant who twerked in a bid to impress a potential date has revealed what goes on behind the scenes on the ITV show.</p>
      <p>Shan, 22, from Wolverhampton, is one of 30 hopeful women who are looking for a chance at romance - and a trip to Fernando's for a sun-soaked date.</p>
      <p>But the former baker-turned-saleswoman, who has even brought her cake creations onto the show, says that one potential love interest got back in touch with her, despite rejecting her on national television.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/take-out-hopeful-who-never-17250610">Birmingham Live</a> : "The second episode that aired, the guy who turned my light off messaged me, a couple of weeks later, telling me he wished he'd picked me.</p>
      <p>"He felt like we would have had a better vibe."</p>
      <p>But Shan was no longer interested.</p>
      <p>She laughed: "I was like, 'It's too late now!'</p>
      <p>"That was last year after filming. He's got a girlfriend now."</p>
      <p>Since appearing on the show, Shan says she has been bombarded with offers from men asking her on a date.</p>

      <p>She said: "I had a lot of people message me saying, 'If you don't get taken out, I'll have to take you out.'</p>
      <p>"There's people messaging me saying, 'You didn't need to go on there, I would have taken you to Fernando's'."</p>
      <p>Shan hasn't revealed whether she managed to find love, but did say the experience she had on the show boosted her confidence.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's an experience of a lifetime, so I was really thankful for the opportunity.</p>

      <p>"I found it really interesting with all these strangers, most people would be concerned, I'm a very empowering lady so I knew I would get on with all the girls.</p>
      <p>"We made friends for life, we still keep in touch as well, we've got a group chat. We all meet up when we can."</p>
      <p>Shan admitted that standing out on the show wasn't always easy, but said that her accent definitely helped matters.</p>
      <p>She said: "My accent makes me stand out because it's so broad and common, so people always remember me for that.</p>
      <p>"I remember host Paddy McGuinness said I sounded like I was from Peaky Blinders!"</p>

      <p>Shan, who has never had a boyfriend, said she thought the show might be a good way to find her 'one person' and jumped at the chance after she was approached by show bosses on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>She said: "For the longest time, I wanted to live life to its fullest and have all kinds of experiences, so I set myself some goals.</p>
      <p>"I've never been in a relationship, not to sound arrogant but it is out of choice - because nowadays relationships are taken for granted.</p>

      <p>"I don't think there's much respect with boys and girls nowadays. I'm just looking for that one person that stands out for me, I don't want to invest my time in people for it to be a waste."</p>
      <p>Shan added that viewers should expect 'a bit of a change' in this series, with the girls being "a bit more brutal".</p>
      <p>"I'm a bit bonkers to be honest, I just say whatever is on my mind.</p>
      <p>"But you have to be careful when you're on TV, because I've got a bit of a foul mouth!"</p>
      <p>
        <b>*Take Me Out, featuring Shan, airs on Saturday at 7.10pm on ITV.</b>
