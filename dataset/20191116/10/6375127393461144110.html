      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa approved the release of P7.4 billion for the yearend bonus of the more than 205,000-strong police force.</h3>
      <p>Following the PNP-OIC’s directive, PNP Director for Comptrollership Major General Jose Maria Victor DF Ramos said at least P7,481,118,702.86 was allotted for the 2019 yearend bonus of 205,189 uniformed and non-uniformedpersonnel nationwide.</p>
      <p>The yearend bonus is equivalent to the amount of the monthly basic salary of each personnel along with the mandated P5,000 cash gift from the national government.</p>
      <p>Gamboa said  the yearend bonus has been credited to the ATM payroll accounts of all police personnel through the Land Bank of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>PNP Finance Service director Brigadier General Joselito Vera Cruz said that PNP personnel who are not yet enrolled in the ATM payroll system will receive their individual cheques through their Regional Finance Service Offices.</p>
      <p>However, Vera Cruz said  the yearend bonuses for PNP personnel with pending administrative and criminal cases have been put on hold as part of PNP disciplinary policy.</p>
