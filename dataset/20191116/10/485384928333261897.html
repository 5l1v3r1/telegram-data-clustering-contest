      <h1>Bringing up a bilingual child is hard work. But passing on your mother language is a gift beyond words</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:15:34+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/earshot/features/tongue-tied-and-fluent/" target="_blank">Tongue Tied and Fluent</a></address>
      <p>Some children learn their first words before they crawl, while others start speaking long after they've learned to run.</p>
      <p>As a parent, natural variability in language acquisition can be anxiety-inducing — even though passing on language to children is seemingly the most natural thing in the world.</p>
      <p>But when it comes to raising a child bilingually, passing on languages other than English doesn't necessary feel 'natural' in Australia because of the way our society centres English.</p>
      <p>Yet linguistic diversity is a fundamental aspect of who we are, and millions of us speak languages other than English.</p>
      <h3>The home language</h3>
      <p>From the moment I fell pregnant, my chief worry was whether I would be able to pass on Vietnamese to my child.</p>
      <p>It's technically my first language — but my fluency is far from perfect, as I've been dominant in English since starting school.</p>
      <p>This is common scenario for parents born and raised here, as well as those who weren't born here but have spent their most formative years in Australia.</p>
      <p>For Zarlasht Sawari, the issue of bilingual parenting is also a pressing one.</p>
      <p>Born and raised in Perth, she grew up speaking Dari, a variation of Farsi.</p>

      <p>Zarlasht has two children: a newborn and a seven-year-old.</p>
      <p>"It was a really important thing for my parents, for my family, that we all speak our language at home," she says.</p>
      <p>"So as soon as we walk in the door, stop speaking English, speak Dari. My mum really was strict on us and I really appreciate it so much now."</p>
      <p>Like Zarlasht, when I was growing up there wasn't necessarily a choice when it came to speaking Vietnamese.</p>
      <p>But even so, during my youth I already had a sense our language was slipping.</p>
      <p>I recall telling my younger brother we should try to speak to each other in Vietnamese rather than English, our preferred language. (It didn't work.)</p>
      <h3>'It is a full-time job'</h3>
      <p>One couple who have successfully created a bilingual environment at home are Triin Pehk and Rob Morris.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Triin migrated from Estonia as an adult and over the years has invested a huge amount of effort and energy into passing on Estonian to her two daughters.</p>
      <p>She has taken quite a strict approach — but now they're both able to speak Estonian, despite the odds.</p>
      <blockquote>"It is one of the hardest things I've ever done, it is a full-time job," Triin says.</blockquote>
      <p>"I have to artificially do a lot of work; every day, every second.</p>
      <p>"I have a friend who's a linguist and we've talked about every theory, we've read the research. And the best way is: one parent, one language."</p>
      <p>At some point during our discussion, Triin turned the tables and posed the following question to me: "Why is it so important for the second generation immigrant to pass on the language?"</p>
      <p>It was a confronting question I didn't have a ready answer for.</p>
      <p>The best answer I could give, which is still my answer now, is that passing on language is important to me because I believe in multilingualism.</p>
      <p>There are also benefits such as a more agile brain and access to other cultures and communities.</p>
      <h3>The gift of language</h3>
      <p>Languages enrich our perceptions and understandings of the world. You miss out on so much if you never learn another language.</p>
      <p>It's why I've invested a lot of time into learning other languages over the years, in addition to improving both my English and Vietnamese.</p>

      <p>Hanna Torsh is a linguist and author of Linguistic Intermarriage in Australia, focusing on mixed language couples.</p>
      <p>In her research, she found it was mothers who are the ones primarily occupied with raising children in languages other than English in Australia, including mothers who have an English-speaking background.</p>
      <p>"The English-speaking background mothers in my study not only took on the responsibility for bilingual child rearing, they also felt responsible for communicating with their in-laws," she says.</p>
      <p>"I think that's because of the social expectations that we have about women and their role in maintaining social relationships, what I call 'kinwork'."</p>
      <p>Of course, fathers also undertake the work of passing on language to their children.</p>
      <p>Dylan Wynne, whose first language is Welsh, is taking the lead in his family in passing on language. His wife has an English-speaking background.</p>
      <p>"They say that you need 20 hours of one-to-one per week in the form of immersion; that's quite challenging for someone that works full-time," he says.</p>
      <p>"So it's good when I get my afternoons off to go to the Welsh playgroup on Sundays.</p>
      <p>"When my son was first born, there was no doubt that I would speak Welsh from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>"And I think if anything's coming from the heart, it's what comes automatically. It's the most beautiful thing."</p>
      <p>Discussing the problem of raising a child bilingually with so many parents has been reassuring, and motivated me to persevere even though it's hard work.</p>
      <p>Bestowing my daughter with an additional language will be a great gift; it will give her a more coherent sense of identity, particularly as she is someone who will grow up mixed-race in Australia.</p>
