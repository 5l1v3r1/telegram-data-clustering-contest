Speaking on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shoaib-Akhtar">Shoaib Akhtar</a>'s YouTube channel, the all-rounder said he tried to raise his voice but was made to keep quiet if he wanted to represent Pakistan.</p>
      <p>"Those players are like my brothers and I do pray for them but what they did, I was against that," Hafeez said on Akhtar's YouTube channel.</p>

      <p>"I raised my voice but I was told that they will play for Pakistan and if you wish to play as well, then you decide (what you want to do) and I was like really? So I went home and took advice as I did not want to spend giving away my positive energy for Pakistan. I continued along with all those players although that was wrong," he claimed.</p>
      <p>"I still say that it is wrong and it will never be fruitful for Pakistan. Bringing back any such player will never be fruitful for Pakistan," he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Akhtar had also claimed that he was surrounded by match-fixers in the national team and that he felt he was playing against 22 men - the opposition and also his teammates.</p>
