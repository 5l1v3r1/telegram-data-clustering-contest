      <p>AN investigation is being conducted by the HSE into the circumstances in which a patient sustained serious injuries after exiting Mayo University Hospital through a second storey window.</p>
      <p>Questions are being raised in regard to the incident which occurred at the Castlebar facility over the weekend of October 26 and 27 last.</p>
      <p>Councillor Michael Kilcoyne said he received a number of complaints in regard to how such an incident could occur in the building.</p>
      <p>The patient has been treated for his injuries in the hospital's intensive care unit and is making a recovery.</p>
      <p>Councillor Kilcoyne stated: “I am very concerned about this matter from the perspective of the health and safety of patients attending Mayo University Hospital.</p>
      <p>“It is beyond belief what happened and a man was left with very serious injuries which resulted in him being cared for in the hospital's intensive care unit for a number of days.</p>
      <p>“The patient sustained the injuries after exiting through a window to a flat roof and falling approximately 35 feet. I have been informed he crashed into a refuse container during his descent.</p>
      <p>“I want to establish what investigation has been carried out by the hospital in relation to this incident and what risk assessment has been conducted to prevent this reoccurring.</p>
      <p>“I am also seeking to find out if this risk has ever been brought to the attention of hospital management prior to this incident and what other action is proposed to be taken on the matter.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Kilcoyne has submitted a list of his queries to the HSE ahead of a meeting of the authority in Galway next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the HSE confirmed there was an incident which it is fully investigating but won’t commenting any further on the matter at this point.</p>
