      <h1>Bristol City's summer transfer targets that will once again be in the spotlight in January</h1>
      <h2>Robins will consider these ones who got away in the last window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <p>The January transfer window can be a source of strength for Championship clubs but also the cause of their downfall.</p>
      <p>As head coach Lee Johnson explained on Sunday: "You've got the January window to negotiate, both in terms of not losing anyone but also adding, even if it's just one, maybe two, to give you that bit of spark."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Robins</a> will be desperate to hang on to Josh Brownhill and other key players - and as the Bristol Sport financial officer explained of two years ago, with the Robins nicely placed in the division, there will once again be the opportunity to go and do something and to push on and hopefully go up.</p>
      <p>"We thought if we can hang onto our stars and add a few key players, we can get promoted. The lure of the Premiership influences a lot of overspending in our league,‚Äù said Gavin Marshall to <a href="https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/business/finance-strategy/for-the-love-of-the-game-bristol-sports-cfo-on-winning-games-achieving">AccountingWeb.com</a> of the January 2018 window and an opportunity with Bristol City in second place in the league.</p>

      <p>Alas, Lois Diony arrived and it was not enough to see City over the line as a slump down to a final finishing spot of 11th ensued. No doubt, the Robins will evaluate every transfer possibility this coming January. And to that end they will certainly look at former transfer targets from the summer who they could not get over the line.</p>
      <h3>Eddie Nketiah</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The most high profile of the names. It's entirely possible that the Arsenal youngster could now get to January without starting a league game for Leeds United.</p>
      <p>Nursing an abdominal injury and out for several weeks, Nketiah missed the chance of a league start recently with rival for the spearhead forward role Patrick Bamford nursing a knock.</p>
      <p>Instead, Bamford has returned and scored at the weekend in a 2-1 win over Blackburn Rovers, even if that was only a 30th minute penalty.</p>
      <p>Bamford has retained head coach Marcelo Bielsa's faith this campaign and he will continue to do so, making the chances of Nketiah being recalled by Arsenal larger. A recall is not expected but if there has not been a league start by January it would surely be inevitable. <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> are waiting in the wings and would take him, with Lee Johnson recently affirming his faith in playing two strikers and having charmed mentor Ian Wright in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Robins supporters should pray for more Bamford goals and Nketiah may be gettable.</p>
      <h3>Scott McKenna</h3>

      <p>With the window coming to a close <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> sent young defender Zak Vyner up to Aberdeen, with the academy product told that he was not in the plans for this season.</p>
      <p>A campaign with the Dons is however coming along nicely and Vyner has even featured in midfield recently. And part of the discussions with the Scottish club involved the availability of the coveted central defender Scott McKenna.</p>
      <p>The Robins were told he was not available and he is locked down in a long-term contract. With Ashley Williams having now arrived, the chances of a big splash on a centre-back are remote, even one of the pedigree of the 22-year-old 12-cap Scottish international.</p>
      <p>But should one leave then a space may free up. And if the right price is set this could be some astute long-term planning.</p>
      <p>McKenna handed in a transfer request in the summer and attracted bids from QPR and Nottingham Forest. More are expected in January with former Robins boss Derek McInnes <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50083379">recently admitting that</a> Aberdeen only get 'one chance of selling Scott'.</p>
      <p>Highly unlikely but the market moves fast.</p>
      <h3>Britt Assombalonga</h3>

      <p>Lee Johnson remains a fan of the striker who impressed and scored at Ashton Gate earlier this season. He has six goals in 15 Championship starts and would play a similar role to that of Benik Afobe.</p>
      <p>A big money fee might tempt Boro into cashing in and allow them to spend the sum on improving their squad in other areas.</p>
      <p>Interest last summer failed because of the fees involved and Johnson receiving mixed signals from all involved, but this is one that could yet be revived if Jonathan Woodgate and co feel they can move on and improve themselves.</p>
      <p>Don't write it off just yet.</p>
