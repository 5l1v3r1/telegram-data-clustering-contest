      <h3>SAN JOSE CITY - Six members of the terrorist Communist Party of the Philippines- New People’s Army group voluntarily surrendered to the police and the military in Nueva Ecija on Friday.</h3>
      <p>Provincial police director Col. Leon Victor Rosete said five of the rebels gave themselves up to intelligence operatives of the 2nd provincial mobile force company headed by Lt. Col. Norman Cacho based in this city.</p>
      <p>Their surrender was also facilitated with the help of the PIB-NEPPO and the military’s 84th Infantry Battalion based here, said Rosete.</p>
      <p>Another rebel yielded to PMFC commander Lt. Col. Dennis Wenceslao and the 91st IB under Lt. Col. Jose Marie Torrenueva in Bgy. Labi, Bongabon, Nueva Ecija.</p>
      <p>The said rebels will be utilized as informants to encourage their other comrades-in-arms to surrender and at the same time monitor the CPP-NPA’s supposed nefarious plans particularly about KLG-Sierra Madre.</p>
      <p>Rosete said the rebel surrenderers whose identities were temporarily withheld are now undergoing tactical debriefing procedure at the police camp for proper disposition.</p>
      <p>He said their surrender was in line with the provincial government’s program under Gov. Aurelio M. Umali, dubbed the NE- provincial task force-ELCAC or End Local Communist Armed Conflict.</p>
