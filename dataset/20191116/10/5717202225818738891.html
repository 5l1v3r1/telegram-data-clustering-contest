      <h1>Report: West Brom consider selling Spurs-linked Nathan Ferguson</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7691227/West-Brom-sell-Nathan-Ferguson-January-avoid-losing-defender-cheap-summer.html">According to a report from the Daily Mail</a>, West Bromwich Albion are weighing up selling Nathan Ferguson during the January transfer window, with Tottenham Hotspur amongst his admirers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ferguson has, so far, enjoyed an outstanding season with the Baggies. He has made 13 appearances for the Championship leaders. Though he has predominantly played at left-back, it appears that Spurs are looking at the 19-year-old as the potential answer to their right-back woes.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7691227/West-Brom-sell-Nathan-Ferguson-January-avoid-losing-defender-cheap-summer.html">The Daily Mail reports</a> that Mauricio Pochettino wants the teenager, while Crystal Palace are also interested. And it appears that both clubs have received a boost.</p>
      <p>The Mail reports that Ferguson is out of contract at the Hawthorns this summer. And despite offering him a new five-year deal, West Brom are fearful that he will choose to leave at the end of the season – leaving the Baggies with just a compensation fee.</p>

      <p>According to the Mail, that prospect has forced West Brom to consider a January sale.</p>
      <h3>TBR View – Tottenham should not miss out</h3>
      <p>Tottenham should certainly look to make the most of the uncertainty. He does only have a handful of appearances under his belt, and is yet to play in the Premier League. But it would surely be worth Spurs taking the risk.</p>
      <p>His form for Slaven Bilic’s side hints that he has the potential to be a fantastic player in the future. And his ability to play on both flanks should not be overlooked.</p>
      <p>Spurs may have perhaps wanted to take a longer look before making a decision. But reports that West Brom could consider a January sale should force their hand and tempt them to roll the dice.</p>
