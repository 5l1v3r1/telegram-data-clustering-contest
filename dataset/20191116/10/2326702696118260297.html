      <p>I must admit that I am <i>really</i> looking forward to the release of the next <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/flight-simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>. It has, after all, been a fair while now since the last <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/games">game</a> was released and if the screenshots and <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/trailer">trailers</a> are anything to go by, this new one is going to, at least look, pretty amazing.</p>
      <p>In a report <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/microsoft-flight-simulator/pilot-crisis">via PCGamesN</a>, however, it seems that the team behind the game is getting a lot of interest from aircraft manufacturers. Not necessarily for the reasons you might think though.</p>
      <p>They are instead, hoping that this game release will encourage a whole new generation of pilots to make up for an industry-wide shortfall.</p>

      <h3>Microsoft Flight Simulator To Fix Pilot Crisis?</h3>
      <p>So, what are they hoping this game will achieve? Well, it seems that the commercial air industry has a pretty major problem. Namely, that there is currently a <i>huge</i> shortfall in pilots.</p>
      <p>With roughly around 100,000 required, manufacturers are hoping that the game will provide a level of accuracy that will not only encourage people to be pilots, but also to provide an experience that will effectively be on par with real-world instrument training.</p>

      <h3>Why Is There a Problem?</h3>
      <p>Becoming a commercial pilot isn’t easy. It certainly isn’t cheap either. Most estimates suggest that it costs around $140,000 to train a pilot and (for better or worse depending on how you look at it) you only get 2 cracks at your final test. If you fail the second one, you’re ruled out for life! This isn’t, of course, to be confused with a private pilot’s license (PPL) which is (relatively speaking) simpler and more easily achievable for around $10,000-$20,000.</p>
      <p>So, will Microsoft Flight Simulator help encourage and create more pilots? Who knows. Personally, I prefer just seeing how bad I can make things and seeing if I can fix them. You know, stuff like getting a 747 out of a stall.</p>
      <p>Either way, however, while I don’t see myself flying one in 10 years time, rest assured I’ll be buying this when it releases next year!</p>
      <p>What do you think? Are you looking forward to Microsoft Flight Simulator? Would you like to be a real-world pilot? – Let us know in the comments!</p>
