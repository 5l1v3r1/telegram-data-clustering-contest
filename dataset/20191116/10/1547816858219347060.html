      <p>Our sources told us, "Shruti was approached for Naagin 4 and seeing her capabilities as an actor she could have been seen in a negative role. Shruti was approached for the anti-heroine but she hasn't given a nod yet." When contacted Shruti, she said, "Yes, I was approached for Naagin 4 but due to my prior commitments I can't do it. I wish Ekta ma'am and the entire team, good luck. Looking forward to associating with them in the near future."</p>
