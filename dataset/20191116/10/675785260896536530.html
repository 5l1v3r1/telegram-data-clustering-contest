      <p>Former Liverpool and Leeds defender Dominic Matteo has undergone an operation on a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>Matteo, 45, is currently being treated in hospital after falling seriously ill earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The former Scotland international is now coming out of intensive care.</p>
      <p>A statement from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> read: "The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Dom, his family and friends and we will be offering our support to them throughout this difficult time.</p>
      <p>"We wish Dom a full and speedy recovery and will offer any support we can to his wife and family.</p>
      <p>"Dom's family would like to place on record their gratitude to all staff at Leeds General Infirmary and express their thanks for all of the messages of support they have received."</p>

      <p>Matteo made his Liverpool debut in 1993 and went on to make over 100 appearances for the club.</p>
      <p>Speaking last month, Matteo said: "I didn’t want to leave Liverpool, that’s the truth. I had five years left on my contract. Me and Houllier didn’t get on.”</p>
      <p>“It’s very hard to compare with Liverpool. I’d come through the ranks, so you’re brought up a certain way – The Liverpool Way. I’ve never really changed from that. Wherever I went that was always going to be in me."</p>

      <p>The defender joined Leeds in 2000 and was later named captain as the Elland Road side made it to the semi-finals of the Champions Legaue.</p>
      <p>He also had spells with Blackburn and Stoke and won six caps for his country.</p>
      <p>Since retiring Matteo has turned his hand at punditry and is a regular on Premier League matchday coverage.</p>
