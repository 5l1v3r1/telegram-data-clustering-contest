      <p>Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson have been spotted looking like the most adorable couple as they film for rom-com Marry Me.</p>
      <p>As Owen would say, ‘Wow!’</p>
      <p>The pair, who will be starring in the flick alongside Sarah Silverman and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game Of Thrones</a>’ John Bradley, were dressed up to the nines.</p>
      <p>Jen rocked a pale pink coat and dress, with Owen fixing a corsage to her wrist at one point during filming in New York City, with the on-screen couple giving us all the date night goals.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Marley And Me star looked dapper in a suit, with JLo laughing as she played with the flower in his pocket.</p>

      <p>Jen is also preparing for her big day in real life after getting<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/29/jennifer-lopez-and-alex-rodriguez-celebrate-engagement-with-daughters-and-celebrity-friends-10827522/"> engaged to her fiancé Alex Rodriguez during a dreamy holiday.</a></p>
      <p>The singer and actor revealed she has yet to do much planning for the big day, telling Entertainment Tonight: ‘We’re talking about it, but we don’t have any firm plans… and we’re talking about a lot of places [to get married in], but I don’t know yet.’</p>
      <p>And it seems ARod has had a huge impact on the singer, with her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/15/jennifer-lopez-now-understands-marriage-as-she-prepares-for-wedding-number-4-to-alex-rodriguez-10746887/">explaining that she ‘understands marriage’ after meeting him.</a></p>

      <p>So cute!</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9929563/jennifer-lopez-pole-dancing-hustlers-wedding-no4/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunmaintwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1568543659">The Sun</a>, she said: ‘I think I’ve understood that marriage takes a lot more than just falling in love and sharing a home.</p>
      <p>‘Alex and I had a connection from the very beginning and maybe could see a future for ourselves.</p>
      <p>‘We talked about it a few times. But when he proposed it was a ­surprise for me. We love each other, love being around each other and have a lot of respect for each other. That’s a big part of it.’</p>
      <p>We’ll be waiting on our invite then, guys.</p>
