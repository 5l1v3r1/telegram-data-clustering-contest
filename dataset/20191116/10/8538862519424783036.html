      <h1>Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend? - Issue 298</h1>
      <h2>From a galaxy far, far away</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/get2sammyb" target="_blank">Sammy Barker</a></address>
      <p>Believe it or not, the big holiday release schedule is all but over. With the release of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/star_wars_jedi_fallen_order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, it’s perhaps time to turn your attention back to your backlog – or the many titles you bought over the past few weeks that you haven’t had time to finish yet. What are you playing this weekend? You know the drill.</p>
      <h3>Robert Ramsey, Deputy Editor</h3>
      <p>Gold Rathian is currently the bane of my existence in <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world_iceborne">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a>. I need that awesome armour but getting it ain't exactly easy. This weekend is therefore dedicated to the glorious hunt... And maybe some <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Standing</a> when the inevitable frustration takes hold.</p>
      <h3>Stephen Tailby, Associate Editor</h3>
      <p>Aside from some smaller games I need to look at for future Mini Reviews, I'm at a bit of a loss this weekend. Maybe I'll pick up where I left off with <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/control">Control</a> -- it'd be nice to see that through to the end, even if the game's performance is still on the rough side.</p>
      <h3>Liam Croft, Senior Staff Writer</h3>
      <p>I'm feeling the force this weekend as I dive into Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order for review. I've also got <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokemon Shield</a> to play on my Nintendo Switch, and I can only resist the temptation of Sobble for so long.</p>
      <h3>Graham Banas, Reviewer</h3>
      <p>I've been thinking about nothing but Star Wars all week, and I cannot wait for my copy to show up so I can go nuts! It's been so long since there was a good Star Wars game (<a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/star_wars_the_clone_warsn_republic_heroes">Republic Commando</a>, maybe?) and I cannot wait. This is made even easier that after spending a few hours with Death Stranding; I have no interest in picking it back up for the foreseeable future, so at least there are fewer things for the backlog.</p>
      <h3>Jamie O'Neill, Reviewer</h3>
      <p>It's been ages since I completed <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/marvels_spider-man">Marvel's Spider-Man</a>, so I'll run up skyscrapers and swing from buildings to let Peter have a peek at any missed extras dotted around New York City.</p>
