      <p>"We can't wait to meet this dynamic new group of women and have them show us around Salt Lake City!" Bravo stated.</p>
      <p>Cohen promised fans of the show that the new location would provide "plenty of unexpected entertainment," according to PEOPLE.</p>
      <p>“You didn’t see it coming but I have to tell you, in Utah, you have the majesty of the mountains, the Mormon religion, an exclusive community of people who have very successful businesses who live in their own universe,” he stated in PEOPLE.</p>
      <p>Cohen added:</p>
      <blockquote>It is gorgeous and I think you’re going to be really surprised and intrigued by the group of women we’ve found.</blockquote>
      <p>Cohen, who is also the franchise's executive producer and host of "Watch What Happens Live," also noted that the women involved "mingle with Hollywood figures at Sundance" according to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094133/get-ready-for-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city">E! News</a>.</p>
      <p>Below is the official statement from Bravo given to E! News on that describes the show:</p>
      <blockquote>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City takes viewers into an undiscovered world that is about so much more than religion, although the Mormon church is undeniably engrained in the culture. In the majestic mountains of Utah is a hidden social circle made up of successful women who have created their own paradise filled with luxury homes, shopping sprees and multi-million-dollar businesses and brands. With Hollywood's exclusive Sundance Film Festival in their backyards, these Type-A power-brokers are accustomed to rubbing elbows with A-listers and what party list you are on means everything. They have mastered running wildly successful enterprises by day and enjoy après ski at the finest resorts by night, all the while raising extraordinary and unconventional families. Here perfection is not an aspiration, it's a mandate. They hold themselves and each other to an extremely high standard and never hold back when things go sideways, but lord knows they are always there for each other when they need it most.</blockquote>
      <p>"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City" is expected to premiere in 2020; however, neither Cohen or Bravo confirmed an official release date nor stated whether the show will premiere on Bravo or Peacock - NBCUniversal's new and upcoming streaming service.</p>
