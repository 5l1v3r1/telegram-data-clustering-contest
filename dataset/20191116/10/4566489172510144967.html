      <h1>Review: O.A.R. puts on upbeat concert at The Paramount on Long Island </h1>
      <h2>Huntington - On November 15, acclaimed rock group O.A.R. performed at The Paramount in Huntington on Long Island, for a good turnout.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:31:32+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/user/274377" target="_blank">Markos Papadatos</a></address>
      <p>This marked their second consecutive show at this Long Island venue in two days as part of "The Mighty Fall" Tour, presented by SiriusXM The Pulse. They also played <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/review-o-a-r-rocks-the-paramount-with-smooth-and-sultry-vocals/article/538229">The Paramount</a> this past December, as they were wrapping up their "Just Like Paradise" Tour.</p>
      <p>It was great to hear them sing their classic hits "Peace" and "Shattered (Turn the Car Around)," which is this journalist's all-time favorite O.A.R. tune, as well as songs from their latest studio offering, <i>The Mighty</i>, such as "California," featuring Marc Roberge's crisp vocals, the midtempo and nonchalant "Knocking at Your Door" and the atmospheric "Free."</p>
      <p>Equally moving was the stirring ballad "All Because of You," as well as "Are You For Real" and "Nantucket Is Gone," which is pure ear candy.</p>
      <p>An added treat was Roberge and the band covering "The Downeaster Alexa" by Billy Joel, which was sheer bliss.</p>
      <p><i>The Mighty</i> is available on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-mighty/1452702104">Apple Music</a> and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6aaRaPwK2QDEIro5UcHMIO">Spotify</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Verdict</b>
      </p>
      <p>In summation, O.A.R. was superb at The Paramount on Long Island. Their set was high-octane, entertaining and fun. O.A.R. gets better every time that they take the stage, and they prove that they are one of the most underrated bands out there.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, O.A.R. allowed their organic music to speak for itself, and that speaks volumes of their musicianship. Their concert at The Paramount garnered an A rating. Well done guys.</p>
