        <b>McLaren have had an incredible season and have really stood out and made improvements since their disastrous 2018 season. Carlos Sainz believes that qualifying is still an area that his team can improve on. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>"Yes, it is no secret and it does not worry us, but it is something we would like to find out, especially since we do not know if we have won something in qualifying or we have lost something in the race. Obviously, in qualification, we are closer than ever,"</i> Sainz said to <i>Marca newspaper</i>. </p>

        <i>"Staying at eight tenths in a circuit like Austin, one of the paths that has more 'real' curves is incredible, but then it is true that in the race we are 1.5 seconds away like the rest of the year. In these two races that missing, we will investigate that."</i>

        <i>"That is a short lap will mean that we will be eight-tenths of the best, while the rest will be three-tenths of us. I think that the short lap will bring half of the grid closer to us than McLaren forward."</i>
      </p>
      <p>McLaren will hope that they can hold off the midfield competition and have another solid race in Brazil. </p>
