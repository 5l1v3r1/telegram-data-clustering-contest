      <p>But bosses generously decided to lift the ban after inviting him to an exhibition as the comedian promised to be on his best behaviour.</p>
      <p>When asked if he considered carrying out a repeat offence he assured it was a one off, and that he had given up drinking but not 'his willy'.</p>
      <p>The hilarious story was unveiled in his new book Tall Tales and Wee Stories.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/billy-connolly-scotland-s-fed-up-voting-for-people-and-getting-somebody-else-1-5047095">Scotsman</a> he revealed how it was his wife of 30 years, Pam, who helped him ditch booze by refusing sexual favours.</p>
      <p>He admitted it had started to 'take control' and twist his personalty into a 'bogey man' .</p>
      <p>In the interview with the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/billy-connolly-scotland-s-fed-up-voting-for-people-and-getting-somebody-else-1-5047095">Scotsman</a> about the his genital and gin slip he said: "That’s true. I was banned.</p>
      <p>"Then they had an exhibition of photographs and invited me in to see it and I said ‘but I’m banned’, so they lifted the ban for the night.</p>
      <p>"Then they lifted it completely. So I’ve been back.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I don’t stick my willy in a gin and tonic any more.</p>
      <p>“I gave up drinking. I still have the willy.”</p>
      <p>The Scots star went on to talk about Pam the New Zealand-born psychologist, writer and performer who shot to fame in BBC’s Not the Nine O’Clock News 1979 comedy sketch show, “saved him.”</p>
      <p>He said:“She withheld sexual favours till I stopped. She nagged me.</p>
      <p>“I was never big on drugs, it always lasted too long.</p>
      <p>"I always wanted it to go away once I had done it, but I was good at drinking.</p>
      <p>"I loved the whole pub thing, getting pissed with the boys, telling stories into the night... and it was getting control, changing my personality.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I became this other man.</p>
      <p>"Pamela would say ‘bogey man has arrived’.</p>
      <p>"And when it’s changing your personality you have to have a close look at it and do something about it.</p>
      <p>"There’s nothing like the truth to put you right.”</p>
      <p>The comic legend also spoke about how 'weird' it was that he had to go on TV and announce ‘Ah’m no deid yet’ after getting condolence messages from across the globe.</p>
      <p>It comes after he retired last year from stand-up causing widespread panic over his health.</p>
      <p>Billy told the Scotsman: "I didn’t really die.</p>
      <p>“What happened was I did something on film and was talking about bits of my body that were failing to work any more and changing or weakening, and people thought I was dying.</p>
      <p>"I was getting messages of condolence from all over the world. I had to go on telly and say ‘I’m no dead’, ‘I’m no dyin’, which is weird.”</p>
      <p>Despite the retirement announcement, there was new speculation he might make a return to live performing was after a film of his final tour gig in 2015 burst into cinemas.</p>
      <p>But he was quick to shoot down the prospect.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/billy-connolly-scotland-s-fed-up-voting-for-people-and-getting-somebody-else-1-5047095">The celeb said</a>: “No, I won’t.”</p>

        <figcaption>Pam helped him ditch booze</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“That’s over. I’ve no intention of doing stand-up again.”</p>
      <p>Touching on politics the comedian who had always been vague about his thoughts on an independent Scotland said 'Scotland’s fed up voting for people and getting somebody else.'</p>
      <p>Connolly came out firmly against Brexit in his previous book Made in Scotland and writing: "The most important thing for Scotland is to keep our contact with Europe.</p>
      <p>"Scots voted to stay in Europe, and if the only way for us to do that is to become independent from England, that may just be the way to go.”</p>
      <p>He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/billy-connolly-scotland-s-fed-up-voting-for-people-and-getting-somebody-else-1-5047095">the Scotsman</a>:“I had been really vague.</p>
      <p>“They kept asking about it, and wouldn’t go away, and it’s a terribly difficult subject… because I don’t live in Scotland, and don’t have a house there any more, I don’t get a vote.</p>
      <p>"I don’t want to be one of those guys who lives in a sunny place and is patriotic then.</p>
      <p>"So I just said whatever the people of Scotland want is OK by me.”</p>

        <figcaption>He had to remind the world he 'wasn't dead yet'</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Then when probed 'If Scotland wants it then you want it as well?' he added:“That’s right.</p>
      <p>"Scotland’s fed up voting for people and getting somebody else.</p>
      <p>"They’re fed up voting for one party and being lumbered with another.</p>
      <p>"You end up with Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>“And if people want to stay in Europe that sounds like a sensible idea to me.</p>
      <p>"I don’t understand Brexit, haven’t a clue what it means, what will happen if you come out of Europe</p>
      <p>"I would try and read about it and lose the will to live.”</p>
