      <p>As the wireless earphones scene starts to get competitive, companies are launching their version of Bluetooth earphones, complete with a charging case. Among some of the great option on the market right now, HUAWEI has come out with the HUAWEI Freebuds 3. This exciting new product has everything you could want from your wireless audio experience, and more. Powered by the Kirin A1 chipset, HUAWEI aims to build a connected audio life experience.</p>
      <p>HUAWEI sent XDA a pair of the Freebuds 3 to test out. We tried these out in many different situations to see if it to see if it holds up against other true wireless earbuds on the market.</p>

      <h3>HUAWEI FreeBuds 3 Powered By The Kirin A1</h3>
      <p>The HUAWEI FreeBuds 3 are equipped with Bluetooth 5.1 and are powered by the cutting-edge Kirin A1 chipset. The Kirin A1 is the industry’s first BT/BLE dual-mode chip to be verified by Bluetooth 5.1. With this technology, HUAWEI is able to deliver a highly integrated 3+1 modular architecture. This includes an advanced Bluetooth processing unit, powerful audio processing unit, ultra-low power consumption App processor and a<br/>separate power management unit. All of this comes together to ensuring an efficient and stable connection experience.</p>
      <p>While previous wireless headphones were were limited to a single-channel transmission which was split between the two earpieces, Huawei’s self-developed dual-channel synchronous transmission technology fixes this issue. Now left and right pieces have a direct connection to your smartphone, avoiding the need for one earpiece to push audio to the next.</p>
      <p>This new dual-channel system was most noticeable while watching movies and playing games. There is much less lag that you’d normally experience in a bluetooth headset. The Freebuds 3 has ultra-low audio latency at only 190ms.</p>
      <p>These new features make the Freebuds 3 a massive upgrade compared to the previous Freebuds 2. While its predecessor was a highly rated product, it didn’t have active noise cancelling, AI Life app control, or synchronous transmission. HUAWEI has really made a huge leap in technology with the third generation Freebuds.</p>

      <p>The 3rd generation of HUAWEI FreeBuds 3 is the first to feature the new Kirin A1 chip. Instead of just inheriting the previous concepts of true wireless connections, the Freebuds 3 come with genuine new innovations and technologies developed by HUAWEI.  The new efficient chip architecture and dual channel synchronous transmission technology result in an entirely new wireless earbuds experience. The improved anti-interface helps to prevent you from having to interact with your phone, while still being able to control your music through touch controls. The Kirin A1 chip ultimately enables the Freebuds 3 to be a leading rival against Apple and Samsung.</p>
      <h3>20 hr. Battery Life</h3>
      <p>The new HUAWEI FreeBuds 3 aims to provide you with 20 hours of battery life by including their charging case. While the actual earphones have a battery life of four hours, the included case can charge your Freebuds up to 4 times before your case runs out of juice. When it does, you can charge your Freebuds case via the USB-C port, or you can set it on your wireless charger and take advantage of the quick wireless charging feature.</p>
      <p>From our experience with the Freebuds 3, we can confirm that the 20 hr. battery life is accurate. Four hour sessions of music is possible. If you have noise canceling enabled, you’ll use up a little more battery than normal. The case is small enough to comfortably store in a pocket and bring it with you for recharging. The circular design of the case makes it sit nicely in your pocket at any orientation.</p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>The sleek curvy design of the Freebuds 3 is an important aspect of this product. Wireless earbuds are a very noticeable accessory when being worn in public. It’s important that they look as good as they sound. In this department, the Freebuds 3 end up being one of the best looking options on the market. With white and black options, your Freebuds will subtle without being too large or uncomfortable.</p>

      <h3>Studio-Quality Sound</h3>
      <p>Inside of the stylish exterior of the Freebuds 3, you’ll fine a high-sensitivity 14 mm dynamic driver. The powerful bass is made possible by a dedicated bass tube. Bass will sound louder, stronger, tighter and punchier on your Freebuds.</p>
      <p>An essential component to creating an immersive audio experience is active noise canceling. ANC in combination with the class-leading audio processor create an amazing real-time environment noise reduction. This feature is ideal for crowded travel situations, noisy streets, loud restaurants and more.</p>
      <p>The noise canceling technology designed by Huawei reacts to environmental situations, and we found that if you use the AI Life app, you can adjust the noise canceling to make it more effective. Once we got it sounding just right, it  provides you with a consistent and comfortable music listening experience.</p>
      <p>Compared to other noise canceling headphone, the HUAWEI FreeBuds 3 are far superior in effectiveness. When being tested out doors, it did a fantastic job in blocking out noise pollution from traffic. Another situation where it excelled was in a car ride. While these should not be used while driving, if you’re a passenger in a car, train, or plane, these work fantastically in blocking out engine sounds. You will be thoroughly impressed with the ANC feature on the Freebuds 3.</p>

      <p>The unique open-fit design of the Freebuds 3 makes them comfortable to wear for ears of any size. This new design also provides the best possible sound quality from current-gen Bluetooth earbuds,</p>
      <h3>Bone Sensor Clear Calling</h3>
      <p>The Kirin A1 chipset is designed to enhance your call quality by eliminating background noise while enhancing your voice. HUAWEI says this gives your calls a better quality of sound that is closer to a face-to-face conversation. The Freebuds 3 will pick up your voice through the vibration of your bones,using the bone voice sensor. This has the ability to make your voice stand out more during a call. In our tests of this feature, we found a minimal difference between  using the Freebuds 3 and the on-board microphone. That’s not a bad thing though, because Bluetooth microphones tend to have really bad microphone quality. The bone sensing technology allow the Freebuds 3 to have a microphone quality that sounds as good as a wired microphone during a call.</p>
      <p>Voice enhancement is most noticeable when you’re outside on a windy day. The aerodynamic mic duct design acts to suppress wind noises while you’re jogging or walking outside during high winds.</p>
      <p>We really enjoy the HUAWEI Freebuds 3 and think this is a great alternative to the Apple Airpods Pro.
