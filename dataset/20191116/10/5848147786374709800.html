      <h1>F1: Renault shoe fits, now Ricciardo says champagne is his aim in 2020</h1>

      <p>Daniel Ricciardo is missing the taste of post-race champagne, whether supped from a sweaty boot or not, and has made a return to the Formula One podium with Renault his main aim for 2020.</p>
      <p>The Australian switched from Red Bull at the end of last year and has yet to finish higher than fourth for the French team.</p>
      <p>With Red Bull, he won seven races and was famed for the podium “Shoey” – taking off a racing shoe and challenging others to follow his example and quaff the fizz from it.</p>
      <p>“Champagne,” he grinned when asked at the Brazilian Grand Prix, penultimate race of the season, on Thursday about his target for 2020.</p>
      <p>“When I signed with the team, 2020 was the target to finish on the podium at least once…We’re still a little bit away from that.</p>
      <p>“I think with a strong off-season it’s not impossible for us to have a chance to fight for that next year.</p>
      <blockquote>Ultimately, whether it’s champagne or not, we want to get closer to the top three and be in the fight with those three teams more consistently next year.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ricciardo said he knew it was going to be a tough year for former champions Renault after they finished fourth overall in 2018.</p>
      <p>Renault are currently fifth and 38 points behind once-dominant McLaren, who also use the French company’s engines and have made big progress this year, in fourth.</p>
      <p>They also have Mercedes-powered Racing Point only 18 points behind in sixth place, with Toro Rosso a point behind, and cannot rest easy.</p>
      <p>“I knew all this was going to come but I was very open-minded for the season, I was firstly excited to have a fresh start and a change,” said Ricciardo.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t really expect the world from this first season. I knew it would take time to get the team to where we want it to go. I think the second half of the season we’ve had a bit more consistency, that’s been more positive.”</p>
      <p>The Australian said next year, the last before a radical overhaul of the sport, looked better.</p>
      <p>“I’ll start to expect more not only from myself but the team come 2020. I think we’ve learnt a lot and personally I have,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The results haven’t always been what we wanted but I definitely don’t see it being a year to forget or anything like that. Far from it.”</p>
