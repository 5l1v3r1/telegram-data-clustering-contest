      <p>KABUL — Afghan officials say gunmen have shot dead two federal prosecutors as they were driving to Bagram Airfield north of the capital, Kabul.</p>
      <p>Jamshid Rasouli, spokesman for the national Attorney General’s office, said two other prosecutors were wounded in Saturday’s attack.</p>
      <p>He says the prosecutors were heading to the prison at Bagram Airfield, which has held top-level Taliban detainees, including Anas Haqqani. He’s the younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who leads the fearsome Haqqani militant network.</p>
      <p>Anas Haqqani and two other Taliban prisoners were supposed to be freed Friday in exchange for an American and an Australian national.</p>
      <p>But the Taliban say the three prisoners didn’t show up at an exchange site agreed upon with the U.S.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear where those three Taliban prisoners are currently located.</p>
