      <p>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson will miss England’s final Euro 2020 qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday because of injury and illness, respectively.</p>
      <p>It is understood Gomez clashed knees in an accidental collision with Kieran Trippier. Henderson missed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/england-montenegro-euro-2020-qualifer-match-report">the 7-0 home win over Montenegro</a> through suspension and arrived in the England camp with a viral infection.</p>
      <p>Gomez sustained a knock in training on Friday and did not recover sufficiently enough to travel. The pair returned to Liverpool, meaning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/england">England</a> headed to Pristina with a 23-man squad.</p>
      <p>England sealed their qualification for next summer’s tournament against Montenegro on Thursday. However, England’s 1,000th international was somewhat marred <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/raheem-sterling-defends-joe-gomez-boos-england-fans">by the boos that greeted Gomez</a> when he came on as a second-half substitute.</p>
      <p>Gomez was left with a scratch on his face following a confrontation with Raheem Sterling at St George’s Park. Sterling was then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/13/raheem-sterling-unhappy-will-face-kosovo-gareth-southgate">dropped from the squad</a> to face Montenegro.</p>
