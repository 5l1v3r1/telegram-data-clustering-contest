      <h3>POLICE were forced to fire on a 47-year-old farmer who charged them after hacking his wife to death inside their house in Bayambang, Pangasinan  on Friday afternoon, officials said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Suspect Rosendo Panaman was about to be accosted by responding members of the Bayambang Municipal Police Station summoned by his neighbors after he hacked his wife Marivic, 42, when he tried to attack the officers with his bloodied machete.</p>
      <p>One cop was forced to shoot the suspect in self-defense, said Police Regional Office 1 director, Brigadier General Joel Orduña. The official said that both suspect and his wife were rushed to a local hospital where attending physicians declared them dead upon arrival.</p>
      <p>An initial investigation showed that the victim was feeding their pet dogs inside their house in Barangay San Gabriel 2nd around 3 p.m. Friday when the suspect arrived and suddenly hacked her in different parts of the body without any provocation. The victim suffered at least 10 fatal hack wounds.</p>
      <p>A son of the couple tried to help his wounded mother but was forced to run for safety when his father also tried to attack him. Shortly after receiving a call, local policemen rushed to the site where they encountered the suspect still brandishing the same bolo he used in attacking his wife.</p>
      <p>The suspect ignored orders for him to yield and tried to attack the officers prompting one to shoot.</p>
      <p>The local police are still investigating the motive behind the attack and are not discounting the possibility it could have been triggered by jealousy, said Pangasinan Police Provincial Office director, Colonel Redrico Maranan.</p>
