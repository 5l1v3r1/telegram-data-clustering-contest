      <h1>'Our mistake' - Leeds United man's message after Derby County setback</h1>
      <h2>Derby County latest | The Rams currently trail the Championship play-off places by seven points - but their top-six finish last season was followed by a play-off semi-final triumph over Leeds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:25:25+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United striker Tyler Roberts says Elland Road has regained its fortress status after last season's Championship play-off defeat to Derby County.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa's side currently sit third in the table, two points adrift of leaders West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>Despite an indifferent start on home soil in 2019-20, Leeds have now won their last four games at Elland Road to strengthen their promotion credentials.</p>
      <p>They looked set for a return to the Premier League for much of last season, only to fall just short of the top two.</p>
      <p>Bielsa's men faced <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby</a> - who currently trail the top six by seven points - in the play-off semi-finals, and after a 1-0 win at Pride Park, they lost 4-2 in a breathless return leg to end their promotion hopes.</p>

      <p>And Roberts - who has one goal from eight appearances this season - believes they are now showing just how they have bounced back from that disappointment at the hands of the Rams.</p>
      <p>“The boys have forgot about last year and tried to move on from it,” <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/everyone-knows-their-role-tyler-roberts-leeds-uniteds-improvement-under-marcelo-bielsa-1044458">he told the Yorkshire Evening Post.</a></p>
      <p>“Of course, it was our mistake when we came back to Elland Road (against Derby).</p>
      <p>"But Elland Road is a fortress this season, the fans have shown that and kept supporting and believing and it is a great place to be.</p>
      <p>"Missing out last season was not a nice feeling.</p>
