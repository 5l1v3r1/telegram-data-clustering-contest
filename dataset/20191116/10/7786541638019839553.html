      <p>Although the tech giant has never allowed the sale of tobacco or vaping cartridges via apps, some of the 181 now banned apps permitted the user to control settings – such as temperature – on vaping devices, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/15/vaping-apps-go-up-smoke-apples-app-store/">The Washington Post </a>reported.</p>
      <p>“We’ve updated our App Store Review Guidelines to reflect that apps encouraging or facilitating the use of these products are not permitted,” Apple <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-bans-vaping-apps-app-store-n1082996">told CNBC</a> in a statement. “As of today, these apps are no longer available to download.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/s1114-update-number-vaping.html?deliveryName=USCDC_1_3-DM13391">According to the CDC</a>, vaping-related illnesses have killed at least 42 people and forced the hospitalization of nearly 2,200 people in 49 states with pneumonia like symptoms.</p>
      <p>“We’re constantly evaluating apps, and consulting the latest evidence to determine risks to users’ health and well-being,” Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said in a statement.</p>
