      <p><b>Key point: </b>It all comes down to needs and preferences.</p>
      <p>Many gun aficionados have heralded the 9mm handgun as the ideal self-defense firearm, but despite its popularity, the “nine milli” is not the only worthy choice available.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, the 10mm is making a big comeback and it’s got just as many excellent attributes as its counterpart.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.revolvy.com/topic/10mm%20Auto&amp;item_type=topic">First developed in 1983</a> thanks, in part, to the concerted efforts of the FBI and the Smith &amp; Wesson gun company.</p>
      <p>The 10mm is a rimless large pistol with a maximum pressure of 33,000 psi that has some serious power.</p>
      <p>The findings of multiple ballistic gel tests found that the 10mm could travel more than 17 inches after impact whereas the 9mm could only travel 13 inches after impact.</p>
      <p>In other words, a 10mm could penetrate two people at center mass and continue traveling.</p>
      <p>While the 10mm fell by the wayside for many years, recent advances in metallurgy have resulted in a surge in popularity. Modern pistol models are better equipped to handle the 10mm caliber than those built in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Today, we’re going to take a look our my top picks for best 10mm pistols.</p>
      <p>For each, we’ll discuss what makes them a worthwhile purchase and why the 10mm is every bit as ideal a handgun as its nemesis, the <a href="http://gunnewsdaily.com/9mm-1911-pistol/">nine millimeter</a>.</p>
      <p>Are you ready? Let’s get started.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE PURCHASING A 10MM PISTOL</b>
      </p>
      <p>To recap what we’ve already gone over in summary above, there are several considerations a gun owner should contemplate before making a 10mm pistol purchase.</p>
      <p>The key factors to think about when selecting the weapon for your personal needs are durability, price point and reliability.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10MM PISTOL ACCESSORIES</b>
      </p>
      <p>A lot of people think that gun accessories only apply to larger firearms like rifles and shotguns, but there are plenty of accessories for handguns as well.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.beretta.com/">Beretta</a> offers a variety of handgun accessories including custom grips, lasers and lights, rear and front sights and magazines.</p>
      <p>You’ll want to confirm how many rounds your 10mm pistol can hold before purchasing any magazines from such manufacturers.</p>
      <p>I’m a big proponent of <a href="http://gunnewsdaily.com/best-glock-sights/">lasers and lights</a> since they can enable the shooter to fire in any environment, whether it’s day or night.</p>
      <p>Cabela’s carries my absolute favorite light, the <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/product/TRIJICON-RMR-ADJUSTABLE-LED-SIGHT/2047219.uts">Trijicon RMR Adjustable LED Reflex Sight</a>. It’s a tad expensive at $349.00, but it’s worthy every penny.</p>
      <p>You get a true-color multi-coated lens and eight adjustable brightness settings as well as a tritium phosphor lamp. The best part is, it’s powered by a single lithium battery. Each unit also comes with a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SELECTING YOUR AMMO</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ammunition is every bit as important as the gun from which you fire it. The <a href="http://gunnewsdaily.com/handgun-caliber-guide/">10mm caliber</a> is garnering a long-awaited and well-earned reputation among gun consumers, but brands and styles are an integral part of the shooting process.</p>
      <p>Today, 10mm ammo is designed to make its forebears proud with 135 to 180 grain range that’s controllable and precise, providing the user excellent stopping power and ballistics.</p>
      <p>There is much debate among the online community as to which ammo is the best ammo for a 10mm handgun, but the general consensus seems to be this: You don’t want a load that tops out at the teetering edge of <a href="https://saami.org/technical-information/ansi-saami-standards/">SAAMI specs</a>, but you also don’t want something like a 230 grain load which will penetrate too deeply in a defensive situation.</p>
      <p>You want ammunition that will fire cleanly from your firearm every time and you want each round to be accurate.</p>
      <p>People seem to underestimate the 10mm pistol, perhaps because of its checkered past. But the truth is, it can do a lot of damage with very little. For this reason, a fairly mediocre bullet like a 165 grain Montana Gold can produce a substantial wound.</p>
      <p>Here’s a short list of some of the <a href="http://gunnewsdaily.com/ammo-guide/">best ammo</a> out there for a 10mm pistol:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Underwood 165 grain Gold Dot</li>
        <li>Hornady 175 grain Critical Duty</li>
        <li>Reed’s 180 grain Golden Saber</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these loads will let you take care of business with varying degrees of penetration and performance, but none of them will let you down.</p>
      <p>Keeping these tips in mind, let’s take a look at the top ten 10mm’s, and what makes them uniqu</p>
      <p>
        <b>COLT DELTA ELITE</b>
      </p>
      <p>This government model is at the top of the heap when it comes to ten-millimeter semi-automatic handguns. <a href="http://www.colt.com/">Colt</a> was one of the original pioneers of the ten milli and they’ve only gotten better with time.</p>
      <p>This combat pistol blows away much of the competition because it’s got enough power for medium size game hunting in addition to CQC (Close Quarters Combat).</p>
      <p>Each one comes with <a href="http://www.novaksights.com/">Novak sights with dots</a>, an enhanced hammer, wide slide serration, a lowered ejection port and an upswept beavertail grip safety.</p>
      <p>At $1,099, the Delta Elite is a bit more affordable than some of its counterparts and you’ll know that you are paying for quality engineering and a durable build.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DAN WESSON RZ-10</b>
      </p>
      <p>This 1911 model has a Clark-style target rib machined on the top of the slide with defensive sights.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://danwessonfirearms.com/">Razoback</a>‘s got a pair of sexy double diamond Cocobolo grips that are a nice touch for collectors.</p>
      <p>This is another one that’s on the pricey side at $1,499.99, but it’s a high-performance single action pistol that is known for never jamming and never disappointing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>EAA WITNESS P CARRY</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a great option for those looking for a carry gun. It’s a low profile weapon with snag resistant sights and a stainless steel slide.</p>
      <p>Unlike some other models, the Witness features a magazine that can hold 15 rounds. It’s got a one-piece full size polymer grip and an automatic firing pin block.</p>
      <p>You won’t find the Witness at Cabela’s or 1800gunsandammo.com, but <a href="https://www.cheaperthandirt.com/">Cheaper Than Dirt </a>sells them for $548.96.</p>
      <p>
        <b>GLOCK FLAT DARK EARTH GEN 4 FULL-SIZE PISTOL</b>
      </p>
      <p>This one is an aesthetic marvel and a shrewd one at that. If you’re looking for cover and you’re in an outdoor combat situation, this is the 10mm pistol you want to have on your hip.</p>
      <p>Its forest green body is but one of the Gen 4’s terrific features. Built for performance and durability, the Dark Earth Gen 4 has fixed sights, a shiny finish and an enlarged, reversible magazine release.</p>
      <p>Each FDE Gen 4 comes with three customizable backstraps and three magazines. Its RTF (Rough Textured Frame) makes it easy to handle.</p>
      <p>Perhaps second only to its discreet color is its price point. <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/">Cabela’s</a> offers the Glock FDE Gen 4 for just $599.99. When you consider the rising prices on most full-size pistol models, this one’s an absolute steal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KIMBER ECLIPSE CUSTOM II</b>
      </p>
      <p>This 1911 pistol is a two-tone handgun with stainless steel match-grade barrels and bushings.</p>
      <p>Each one comes with full size grips, a chamber indicator port, high-ride beavertail grip safety and an extended thumb safety. The Commander-style hammer and checkered side release are also quite appealing to most avid shooters.</p>
      <p>It’s also got a brushed polished carbon slide and rosewood grips, making it one of the more attractive ten millis on the market. This one is famed for its hair-splitting accuracy and precision design.</p>
      <p>You can usually get your hands on one for less than $700. Cabela’s has a few on sale for $699.99. They also offer a Kimber Eclipse Custom kit with a discount price of $949.99. It comes with a handsome leather holster, an aligner insert and eight-round KimPro TacMag magazines.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PARA USA ELITE LS HUNTER</b>
      </p>
      <p>This one’s got all the bells and whistles you want in a 10mm handgun from its adjustable rear target sight and green fiber optic front to its six-inch ramped barrel and beavertail grip safety.</p>
      <p>It’s a high-end variation on the 1911 that comes with a bevy of unique features including VZ Operator machined G10 grips, oversized, flared ejection port, and an EGW HD Extractor.</p>
      <p>At $1,249.00, it’s not the cheapest model on my list, but it’s certainly worth every penny. Pound for pound, the Elite LS Hunter is a python compared to some of the cheaper choices available to the general public.</p>
      <p>
        <b>REMINGTON 1911 R1 SEMI-AUTOMATIC HUNTER LS</b>
      </p>
      <p>You know the expression, “What’s in a name?” Well, when it comes to <a href="https://www.remington.com/">Remington</a>, the name speaks for itself. Remington has maintained a solid reputation among gun enthusiasts since 1816.</p>
      <p>In the last 201 years, they’ve continued to improve upon each of their firearms, maintaining a position in the industry as masters of innovation and excellence.</p>
      <p>The 1911 is no exception in terms of classic values and contemporary quality. Remington’s 1911 R1 is a beautiful piece with a black body and a gleaming silver stainless steel slide.</p>
      <p>With a match-grade stainless barrel, serrated slide, premium grip panels and two magazines, this one’s got the works.</p>
      <p>Cabela’s stocks the R1 starting at $649.99 while <a href="https://www.1800gunsandammo.com/">1800gunsandammo.com</a> has the R1 .45 with Cocobolo grips for $725.00.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ROCK ISLAND ARMORY TAC ULTRA MS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The sleek, snub-like design of the <a href="http://armscor.com/">TAC Ultra MS</a> makes it a superior pistol for conceal and carry purposes. It’s compact, ergonomic and contemporary with a modern three-slat trigger, front and rear CNC angle grooves and Piccanniny rail.</p>
