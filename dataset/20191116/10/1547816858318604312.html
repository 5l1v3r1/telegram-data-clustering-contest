        <b>Shehnaaz Gill's father thinks that his daughter's arch-rival Himanshi Khurana should play on the front foot and discuss the ugly spat the two girls had in the past</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/search?q=bigg%20boss%2013">Bigg Boss 13</a> fans have been waiting for a lot of fireworks between rivals <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/search?q=shehnaaz%20gill">Shehnaaz Gill</a> and <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/search?q=himanshi%20khurrana">Himanshi Khurana</a>. The two, who made headlines for their ugly spat over social media, were brought to the controversial house essentially so that the viewers get to know what went wrong between the two and how they behave inside in each other's presence. Shehnaaz entered the House in the premiere episode whereas Himanshi came in as a wild card entry. Seeing Himanshi, Shehnaaz did lose her temper--- but nothing much about their friction has snowballed since then, at least not yet. <br/><br/>We spoke with Shehnaz's father Santokh Singh on how the Shehnaaz-Himanshi spat has seemingly gone cold. "When Himanshi entered the house, Shehnaaz welcomed her but Himanshi ignored Shehnaaz completely and went away. I think that disturbed my daughter a lot and she took this to heart.<b> <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-shehnaaz-gill-vs-himanshi-khurrana-punjab-ki-katrina-or-punjab-ki-aishwarya-who-wins-in-social-media-akhada/5dc92b5c87fb571eff7e3ad1">(ALSO READ:- Bigg Boss 13 Shehnaaz Gill VS Himanshi Khurrana: Punjab Ki Katrina Or Punjab Ki Aishwarya - Who Wins In Social Media Akhada?</a>)</b><br/> </p>

      <p>Also, Shehnaaz seems to have got insecure seeing Himanshi inside because she felt that whatever love and positivity she was being praised for, might now be marred. But Himanshi has gone inside the house after studying the game really well, and her plan to hit Shehnaaz by  taking Sidharth Shukla away from her succeeded to an extent. All said and done, I am happy that Shehnaaz and Sidharth are back with each other". <b><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-shehnaaz-gill-apologises-to-wild-card-entrant-himanshi-khurana-s-mother-video/5dc25d7487fb571eff7e3760">(ALSO READ:- Bigg Boss 13: Shehnaaz Gill Apologises To Wild Card Entrant Himanshi Khurana’s Mother - VIDEO</a></b>)</p>

      <p>Recounting the Shehnaaz-Himanshi friction, Shehnaaz's father explained, "It all started with one small song of Himanshi  named 'I like it'. Shehnaaz didn't like the song and she posted a video on her snapchat, saying, 'Mujhe ye gana pasand nahi aaya, so I don't like it'. The disagreement was for the song and not personal but Himanshi overreacted and said something very nasty about me, which didn't go well with Shehnaaz and she, in turn, passed some comments on her mother. But you know, it was all done by one make-up artist named Rajan Pasi who used to work with both of them aur woh dono mein aag lagata tha". <b><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-himanshi-khurana-reveals-her-tiff-story-with-shehnaaz-gill-asim-riaz-arti-singh-listen-on/5dc03dff87fb571eff7e3652">(ALSO READ:- Bigg Boss 13: Himanshi Khurana REVEALS Her Tiff Story With Shehnaaz Gill; Asim Riaz, Arti Singh Listen On)<br/></a></b><br/>He also added, "Himanshi is crying inside that her mother and brother suffered a lot due to Shehnaaz's comment--- but she is not telling anybody that she was the one who actually started it by talking s**t about me. I am happy that my daughter tried to resolve the issues with her, and in fact, even said sorry to her family on camera. But Himanshi apparently hasn't come with a mood to sort out things. <b><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-spoiler-shehnaaz-gill-creates-a-ruckus-cries-pulls-out-her-hair-on-seeing-rival-himanshi-khurrana-enter-as-wild-card/5dbe996987fb571eff7e3565">(ALSO READ:- Bigg Boss 13 SPOILER: Shehnaaz Gill Creates A Ruckus, Cries, Pulls Out Her Hair On Seeing ‘Rival’ Himanshi Khurana Enter As Wild Card)</a></b></p>

      <p>However, if you notice, Himanshi is playing on the back foot these days and not broaching upon any topic which has to do anything with Shehnaaz." </p>
      <p>Even Salman Khan tried his bit in the matter, thinks Mr Singh. "Salman told Shehnaaz that she is wrong and Himanshi is right in this matter. Basically, woh aag lagana chah rahe the taaki dono lade aur show ko masala mile."  <b><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-post-himanshi-khurana-s-entry-in-the-house-old-clips-of-shehnaaz-gill-body-shaming-her-and-insulting-her-parents-go-viral/5dbebb6787fb571eff7e3572">(ALSO READ:- Bigg Boss 13: Post Himanshi Khurana's Entry In The House, Old Clips Of Shehnaaz Gill Body-Shaming Her And Insulting Her Parents Go Viral)</a></b></p>

      <p>Singh advises the two girls to discuss their past issues on the show. "Things should get clear on the show itself.  Himanshi has got the opportunity to be on Bigg Boss 13 because of (her controversy with) my daughter, or else she's not popular enough to get such a big platform. Itnii badi to star woh hai nahi jo use Bigg Boss ghar mein bulayen. If Himanshi will not discuss this matter, she will be out soon. The makers will start to feel jab kuch andar kar hi nahi rahi, toh isko andar bheja hi kyun" Santokh Singh signed off.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/shehnaazgill/iamhimanshikhurana/pr</i></p>
