      <h3>THE Gold Squad is composed of the teen love teams of ABS-CBN’s “Kadenang Ginto”: Andrea Brillantes-Seth Fedelin and  Francine Diaz-Kyle Echarri. Kathniel, Jadine and Lizquen will eventually grow old and play more mature roles and it’s wise of ABS to prepare the teen love teams who will replace them. Now, aside from their afternoon soap, the Gold Squad love teams also have their own respective movies to be shown on iWant streaming.</h3>
      <p>For KyCine (Kyle-Francine), it’s “Silly Red Shoes” directed by James Mayo, and for SethDrea (Seth-Andrea), it’s “Wild Little Love” directed by Benedict Mique. They were all presented in back to back presscons, with their movies also to be shown back-to-back streaming on November 23 and 27 as a special first anniversary presentation of iWant. Now, to find out which movie will be shown first, Dreamscape is conducting a Facebook poll. You have up to 10 p.m. of November 22 to vote which one you want to see first: Team Silly or Team Wild.  </p>
      <p>In “Silly Red Shoes”, Francine plays Ashley and Kyle plays Chuck. Shot in Liliw, Laguna, Kyle is a young shoemaker who wants to Francine to be the model for a pair of shoes he will make for her. But the problem is that Francine’s feet seem to change sizes everyday, until they discover a mysterious pair of red shoes that seem to be too perfect for her. Done with a touch of fairy tale fantasy, the movie also stars former QC Mayor Herbert Bautista as Francine’s dad, along with Anna Luna and Karen Reyes.</p>
      <p>So how is it shooting “Silly Red Shoes”? “We have good memories of shooting it on location Liliw,” says Kyle, who is the most articulate of the four teen stars and can express himself well even in English. “It’s our first movie and we enjoyed doing it, kulitan, inabot pa kami ng ulan. It helped us explore our acting skills kasi iba ito sa ginagawa namin in ‘Kadenang Ginto’. Ang role ko roon as Kristof, rich boy. Dito, poor boy ako na pabibo as Chuck at natuwa akong kaya ko naman pala.”</p>
      <p>“Same with me,” says Francine. “My role as Cassie in ‘Kadena’ is so different kasi she can say what she feels. Dito sa movie, as Ashley, akala mo, masayahin siya pero sa loob pala niya, durog na durog na siya. Father ko rito si Mayor Herbert  at sobrang masaya siyang katrabaho. Bagets na bagets siya at parang katropa lang namin.”</p>
      <p>What did they discover about each other while shooting “SIlly Red Shoes”? “I discovered that she is a really deep person,” says Kyle of Francine. “But she’s also cheerful. She will always put on a smile kahit anong mangyari.”</p>
      <p>“He’s easy to get along with and we really got to know each other while shooting our film at mas lumalim ang friendship namin,” says Francine. “We both like the message of our movie, which is don’t give up and always believe in yourself.”</p>
      <p>How do they feel that they’re predicted to replace the older love teams like Kathniel? “Hindi namin iniisip 'yan,” says Francine. “We’re just enjoying everything now, especially the support of our fans and we want to thank Dreamscape for giving us a chance to do a movie.”</p>
      <p>Next: Andrea and Seth</p>
