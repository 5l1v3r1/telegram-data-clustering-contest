      <h1>Looking Back: Amazing Try From Nevin Spence In Ulster Win Over Bath</h1>

        <b>Ulster visit The Recreation Ground today looking to extend their undefeated streak over Bath to five games in the Heineken Champions Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>An intriguing battle is expected as Bath welcome World Cup star Sam Underhill while <a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/kennedymarisa760/irish-provinces-champions-cup-weekend/">Iain Henderson returns to the northern province to make his bow as the new captain of Ulster</a>.</p>
      <p>Dan McFarland’s side are also boosted by the return of Marcell Coetzee and Will Addison with the other tasty sub-plot to this encounter seeing brothers Billy and Freddie Burns line up against one another at The Rec.</p>

      <p>As stated, <a href="https://twitter.com/UlsterRugby">Ulster</a> will be looking to stretch their undefeated streak over Bath to five on the spin in what they hope will be another memorable run in Europe.</p>
      <p>The last encounter between these two rugby heavyweights came almost nine years ago as a strong Ulster side fought their way from behind to defeat Bath and round off an impressive pool stage campaign that saw them finish second behind Biarritz.</p>
      <p>However, the game is remembered fondly for one moment in particular when the late Nevin Spence finished off an amazing Ulster try in the final quarter of the game that put the northern province in the ascendency as they went on to record a 22-26 victory.</p>

      <p>Ulster trailed by 14-13 as the game entered the final half-hour before turning the game on its head with a passage of play lasting 19 phases eventually finished by Spence who made three strong carries in the build-up before acrobatically flipping over as he finished the score.</p>
      <p>Looking back, it’s amazing to think that Spence was only 20-years-old in this game such was the maturity and leadership in his performance throughout.</p>
      <p>Sadly it would be a little under two years later that the promising young player was taken too soon alongside his father and brother in a tragic accident.</p>

      <p>No doubt when Iain Henderson leads Ulster out this afternoon they will be thinking of the great Nevin Spence and how he continues to inspire the northern province to this day.</p>
