      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:17:13+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>Do you have what it takes to spread a bit of happiness?</p>
      <p>If so then this trio of young entrepreneurs could have the perfect job for you.</p>
      <p>For they're on the hunt for a Lifestyle Happiness Manager and have taken to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/internet">Gumtree</a> to spread the word.</p>
      <p>The perfect candidate will be a perfectionist, who speaks fluent English and not afraid of a bit of hard work.</p>
      <p>They'll be expected to take on a host of menial tasks the trio at their posh flat in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/london">London</a> believe are essential to making their hectic lives perfect, including <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/shopping">shopping</a>, making breakfast and even waking them up in the morning.</p>
      <p>The part-time position pays £15 an hour, and James, who posted the ad, insists the person will "improve the quality" of their lives.</p>

      <p>The advert reads: “We’re three young entrepreneurs that run a business in central London and live together in a mega flat near Old Street.</p>
      <p>“We work pretty long hours every day and most weekends, so we would love someone to be here at the flat, a few hours a day, to take care of all the bits that we don’t have time to do but have a massive effect on our quality of lives and our happiness.”</p>
      <p>The ideal person for the position has to be “passionate about perfection”, “trustworthy like family” and “knows the difference between Tom Ford and Tom and Jerry”.</p>
      <p>It also stresses that the position is not a cleaning role.</p>
      <p>James adds: “We have a cleaner four times a week and that’s not your job. But if there is any cleaning or tidying work to be done or the flat doesn’t look perfect, we want someone who isn’t afraid to muck in.</p>
      <p>“This is not the job for someone who is slack or lazy. This is the job for someone who always thinks of ways we can improve our lifestyle and live happier, healthier and more successful lives.”</p>
