      <h1>Bruno Fernandes addresses future ahead of January after Man Utd and Tottenham transfer interest</h1>
      <h2>Bruno Fernandes was linked with Man Utd and Tottenham in the summer and has now addressed his future with the January transfer window around the corner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:41:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:41</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes was the talk of the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>But he says he is in no rush to force a Sporting Lisbon exit when he gets the chance to leave again in January.</p>
      <p>Fernandes was heavily linked with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , Tottenham and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in the closing stages of the summer window but a deal did not get over the line.</p>
      <p>He eventually signed a new big-money contract with the Portuguese giants and he insists he will not force his way out in January.</p>
      <p>Fernandes did reiterate, however, he has "dreams to come true", hinting he may still look to pursue a move to the Premier League in the future.</p>

      <p>Speaking after Portugal's 6-0 win over Lithuania, Fernandes said: "I'm not worried, since 2016 I'm at Sporting and they say I'm leaving, so far I'm fine.</p>
      <p>"I have dreams to come true, but I'm not worried, I have no reason to force out, I'm fine, in a club I like.</p>
      <p>"On the day I have to leave, if I have to, I hope to leave a good memory."</p>

      <p>Tottenham have been linked with a fresh move to sign Fernandes as they face losing Christian Eriksen and seek a replacement.</p>
      <p>Sporting Lisbon president Frederico Varandas opened up on their battle to keep Fernandes shortly aftr the transfer window closed and revealed they rejected a proposal from Spurs.</p>
      <p>“It was 'impossible' to retain Bruno Fernandes, but we did it," he said.</p>
      <p>"We prepared for his sale by putting a fair price on him, and we had bids, but the only serious offer was from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and that was €45 million (£40m/$50m) plus another €20m (£18m/$22m) in bonuses for winning the Premier League and the Champions League.</p>

      <p>“Those are difficult objectives, so we chose not to accept.</p>
      <p>“Bruno Fernandes proved to be not only a great player but a great professional and captain. The dignity and responsibility that he has always shown is exemplary.</p>
      <p>“The day I turned down Tottenham's proposal, I came to the training ground and spoke to him. I told him why I declined the offer and why he would stay here beyond the end of the market and he understood perfectly.</p>
      <p>“In addition, he also understood that the bid they offered us was not fair. He's not leaving, he's a Sporting player. Many European clubs want him and we know this is something we will always have to deal with.”</p>
