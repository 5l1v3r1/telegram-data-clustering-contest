      <p>Dominic Matteo has undergone an operation on a brain tumour after falling seriously ill earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> star is out of intensive care but remains in Leeds General Infirmary for treatment.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old earned six caps for Scotland between 2000 and 2002 and his illness was made known by former club <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool.</a></p>
      <p>He played 155 times for the Anfield giants before spells at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeds-united-fc">Leeds,</a> Blackburn and Stoke.</p>
      <p>A statement from the club said: "Liverpool FC is sending its support to Dominic Matteo after the former Reds player was taken seriously ill earlier this week.</p>
      <p>"Matteo, 45, underwent an operation on a brain tumour on Monday and is currently being treated in hospital after coming out of intensive care.</p>

      <p>"The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Dom, his family and friends and we will be offering our support to them throughout this difficult time.</p>
      <p>"A popular member of the Liverpool side in the 1990s and a regular pundit and commentator on LFCTV in recent years, Matteo made his debut for the Reds in October 1993.</p>
      <p>"He went on to become a regular under Roy Evans and later Gerard Houllier for four seasons from 1996-97, making a total of 155 appearances for the club.</p>
      <p>"Matteo – who also represented Scotland at international level – departed for Leeds United in 2000, where he spent four years, before spells with Blackburn Rovers and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stoke-city-fc">Stoke City.</a></p>
      <p>"We wish Dom a full and speedy recovery and will offer any support we can to his wife and family.</p>
      <p>"Dom's family would like to place on record their gratitude to all staff at Leeds General Infirmary and express their thanks for all of the messages of support they have received."</p>
