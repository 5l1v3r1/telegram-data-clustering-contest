      <p>Road to the polling unit of Peoples Democratic Party Governorship Candidate, in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, was flooded forcing Electoral observers and journalists to access the area by canoes.</p>
      <p>Residents heading for Diriâ€™s Unit 4 ward 6 in Sampou, Kolokuma-Opokuma Local Government Area, also patronised canoe paddlers, who collected N50 each from them to convey them to the unit.</p>
      <p>Electoral officers and ad-hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were conveyed through the flooded road to the unit by Hilux vans.</p>
      <p>The officers and the materials arrived the unit at about 10am.</p>
