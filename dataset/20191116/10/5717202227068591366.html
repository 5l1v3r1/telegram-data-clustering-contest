      <p>Paul Merson has confidently claimed that Liverpool may as well be handed the Premier League title this season.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside giants have not won a top-flight crown since the 1989/90 campaign and found it difficult since the introduction of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>But they finished runners-up last season with a staggering 97 points and this time appear to have the edge of reigning champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s team have 34 points from 12 league matches so far, with the duo of Leicester City and Chelsea the closest challengers at the moment eight points adrift.</p>
      <p>City sit fourth in the table nine points adrift of Liverpool and were beaten 3-1 on their trip to Anfield before the international break.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports pundit Merson already feels that the Reds have an unassailable lead in the title race.</p>
      <p>“The title race is over so you might as well crown Liverpool champions now. Do I think City can come back from nine points behind? No chance. Liverpool have lost once in about 52 games,” <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/paul-merson-blasts-gareth-southgate-20891101">Merson wrote in the Daily Star.</a></p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is no chance Liverpool fans will be getting too complacent when it comes to the title race and know that a mini collapse could bring others right onto them.</p>
      <p>But logic says that Klopp’s team are major favourites for the league crown, as they have lost just once since the beginning of the 2018/19 season.</p>
      <p>They have a forward line that can go toe-to-toe with any team in Europe and many consider it the best around.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they are defensively solid and it’s hard to picture them dropping many more points.</p>
