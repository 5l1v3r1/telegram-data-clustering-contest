      <p>What would you do for love?</p>
      <p>The men among the Betsileo in Madagascar will fight to subdue a 1,000kg (more than 2,000) raging bull in order to advertise their masculinity for the purpose of attracting a woman or who knows, more.</p>
      <p>This is the tradition of a people whose name means “the many invincible ones”. The centuries-old bullfighting tradition seems perfectly on the invincibility brand, one may say.</p>
      <p><a href="https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=WAQbp7aLpZkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Betsileo&amp;f=false">According to Bethwell Ogot</a>, the Betsileo are some of the oldest groups of people in Madagascar. Until the 18th Century, they existed as satellite communities linked by a narrative of common ancestry.</p>
      <p>It was not until the 19th Century that one could speak of a Betsileo state, a union forced by conquest by the Merina, the largest ethnic group in Madagascar.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Betsileo are Madagscar’s third-largest group.</p>
      <p>They live in the highlands of Madagascar. <a href="https://www.everyculture.com/Africa-Middle-East/Betsileo-Economy.html">Historically agrarian</a>, the Betsileo are known to be major growers of rice, a staple.</p>

      <p>Animal husbandry is also a critical aspect of their livelihood and culture. As you would guess, cattle-rearing is the biggest deal, with common references to social status measured in how much cattle people own.</p>
      <p>Bullfighting, locally known as <i>savika, </i>is a sport that sees young men line up to defeat a <i>zebu</i>, the humped breed of cattle. An audience cheers as the young men are either bloodied by the beasts or successfully get to ride it.</p>
      <p>It begins by letting the bull into a fenced yard and teasing it into anger by trying to climb it via its hump. A young man, who is barefooted, has to try to hold onto the hump for as long as possible if it cannot possibly ride the animal.</p>
      <p><i>Savika </i>is a right of passage. How young men are perceived for the rest of their lives is dependent on how they fair in the rodeo yard; that much is what is on the line.</p>

      <p>Of course, the crossover to manhood comes with choosing a female partner. Whoever a young man has his eyes on will be at the occasion, verifying for herself how strong the young man is.</p>
      <p>The history of <i>savika</i> itself is <a href="https://www.odditycentral.com/videos/savika-wrestling-angry-bulls-in-madagascar.html">undetermined</a>. It, however, appears indigenous to the people, unborrowed from matador culture in Iberian countries.</p>
      <p>The Betsileo maintain <i>savika</i> is <i>fomban-drazana</i>,<i> </i>the ancestral way of doing things.</p>
      <p>In recent times, the sport is still ongoing with its purposes unspoiled by modernity.</p>
