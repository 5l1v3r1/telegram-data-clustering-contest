      <p>Former Newcastle United striker Ivan Toney is the subject of major interest from a host of Premier League clubs this January.</p>
      <p>Both AFC Bournemouth and Burnley are among the teams that have scouted the 23-year-old striker that United sold for just £350,000.</p>
      <p>Now a fee of £13million is being touted by Peterborough United after Toney blasted in 35 goals in 75 games since leaving Newcastle in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Newcastle do have a clause that entitles them to a percentage of any future sales.</p>
      <p>Posh chairman Darragh MacAntony said: "Toney will break the transfer record for a League One player when he goes. If he goes that is. He'll certainly smash the Posh record.</p>
      <p>"We don't want to lose anyone in January, but you can't guarantee anything in football.</p>
      <p>"If we do lose anyone, they will be replaced."</p>
      <p>Toney made just four appearances for Newcastle from the bench before being sent on a series of loan deals at Barnsley, Shrewsbury, Wigan and Scunthorpe United.</p>
      <p>United signed him for just £135,000 from Northampton Town after being recommended by the Cobblers to Graham Carr back in 2015.</p>
