      <p>The Bavarians are currently without a permanent head coach following the departure of Niko Kovac after a 5-1 drubbing of Eintracht Frankfurt earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Joshua Kimmich, who joined Bayern from RB Leipzig under Guardiola, wouldn't mind seeing his former mentor return to the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>"I know [Guardiola] and have a lot to thank him for. He took me from the second division and let me play in the Bundesliga," he told reporters, as per Sky Sports.</p>

      <p>"We won the double together and after that season I became a player for Germany. So, of course, I won't be against him coming back."</p>
      <p>Bayern have won back-to-back games since Hans-Dieter Flick took charge on temporary basis, and Kimmich is unsure when a permanent coach will come in.</p>
      <p>"At first you thought that we would get a new coach after the international break. Now, we won both games with Flick and it sounds like he will stay until winter or even the entire season," the 24-year-old added.</p>
      <p>"What happens then is the business of the club - we players have nothing to do with it."</p>
