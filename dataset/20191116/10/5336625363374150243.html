      <p><b>TL;DR: </b>Get the budget-friendly <a href="https://zdcs.link/rPK8G">PaMu Slide Bluetooth 5 In-Ear Headphones with wireless charger</a> for $99.99, a 49% savings. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Hear that? That's the collective clamoring of Apple fanboys and fangirls desperately trying to get their hands (and ears) on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-reveals-airpods-pro/">the new AirPods Pro</a>, arguably the company's best earphones yet. </p>
      <p>But you don't have to hop on the trend and part ways with your hard-earned $249 when you can get a similar listening experience with something far cheaper, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/rPK8G">PaMu Slide Bluetooth 5 In-Ear Headphones</a>.</p>
      <p>Now on sale for $99.99, these cost less than half of the sticker price of the AirPods Pro, leaving you with a little more left to treat yourself over the holidays. But the affordable price is only part of the appeal. These babies boast a Qualcomm QCC3020 chip and the most advanced Bluetooth 5.0 to deliver unparalleled sonics with extra bass.</p>
      <p>Check 'em out:</p>

      <p>They're ergonomically designed to ensure that they stay in your ears no matter how much you move, and the outstanding battery life provides you with 60 hours of use when you utilize the case. For comparison's sake, the AirPods Pro can only last 24 hours even with the charging case.</p>
      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/rPK8G">These headphones</a> are also IPX6 water-resistant, avoiding damage when exposed to rain, water, or sweat, and they come with a wireless charger to give you a 100% wireless experience.</p>
      <p>If all these cold hard facts aren't impressive enough for you, talk to their fan club. More than 80,000 backers supported the project on IndieGogo. (Receipts can be found <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pamu-slide-born-for-music-never-fall-out#/">here.</a>)</p>
      <p>Usually retailing for $199, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/rPK8G">PaMu Slide Bluetooth 5 In-Ear Headphones</a> are on sale in the Mashable Shop for only $99.99. But if you enter the code <b>BFSAVE15</b> at checkout, you can get them for an additional 15% off, bringing the price down <a href="https://zdcs.link/rPK8G">to $84.99</a>.</p>
