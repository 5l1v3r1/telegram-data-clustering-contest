      <h1>“I’m not gonna say that…”: Virgil van Dijk offers his verdict on the Premier League title race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T10:06:31+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk has insisted that the Reds have won nothing yet in the Premier League title race, despite sitting eight points clear at this early stage of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Having beaten Manchester City last weekend in that incredible match at Anfield, many pundits and rival supporters have been queueing up to suggest that the title race is done, but Van Dijk firmly disagrees.</p>
      <p>Via the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7691449/Van-Dijk-says-Liverpool-not-title-sown-calls-people-Sterling-row.html">Daily Mail</a>, he said: <b>“I’m not gonna say that [it’s Liverpool’s year]. It’s something for the media. For players the main thing is we focus on the game ahead of us.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“For me personally it’s Northern Ireland, it’s a tough task. What happens with Liverpool in the future we’ll see, we have no influence on it, the season is so long. My focus is on the next game, at the moment that’s [with our] national teams.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester City remain the Reds’ most likely challengers. Over the next few months, the Reds will drop points at some stage, if nothing else because of the ridiculous schedule that is to come over Christmas.</p>
      <p>When that happens, how the Reds react – both in terms of the players and the supporters – could go a long way towards defining the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>The Reds are no doubt in a great position to push on, starting at Selhurst Park next weekend, but continuing to win and gain momentum will be vital if that is to happen. Manchester City cannot be given any sniff of hope that they can latch onto to haul themselves back up the table.</p>
