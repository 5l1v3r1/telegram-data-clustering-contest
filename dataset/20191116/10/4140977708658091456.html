            <b>KAT vs DEB Dream11 : New entrants Delhi Bulls look to set a statement today as they push for their second straight win in the league.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Entering the dramatic land f the T10 league for the first time in three seasons, for newly conceptualised Delhi Bulls, the league couldn’t have transpired in a more flourishing style. The side ended up winning their league opener against Deccan Gladiators in comprehensive style to lay down an early marker for their credentials this season.</p>
          <p>Needing more than 100 to win, Delhi’s chase was as comfortable as they come with the side easing their way past the opponents by 7 wickets to chase down the 103 run target with three balls to spare. While the side getting acclimatised to 10 over cricket immediately was something to write home about what saw the side really win us over was the electric performance they doled out despite being devoid of a slew of outstanding players for the opening set of matches.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>And when they take on Karnataka Tuskers today, the side will be looking to reverberate the same display as they look to make it two wins out of two in as many days and maraud their way to the top of Group A. For the Tuskers meanwhile, today’s clash will be a major determinant in how the league will transpire for the side, one they’ll be looking to transcend in tranquil manner come the imminent encounter.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>The T10 format means that irrespective of the pitch doled out, the batsmen are going to go after the bowlers. And the wicket today will assist them in their sorties as well with the ball lying nicely onto the bat, allowing the batters to peel away the boundaries at will.</p>

                      <p>The side winning the toss will be looking to come out and field first and get a clear idea of how to subject themselves to their run chase.</p>

                            <h3>KAT vs DEB Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Karnataka Tuskers’ opener and wicket-keeper, Johnson Charles becomes our choice in this docket with the player not only holing an escalated role but being someone who needs no time to open his arms with ease and accumulate a bagful of runs.</p>
                            <p>Delhi’s opener Kusal Perera had an appalling time in the middle yesterday but the opner has scored 2,127 runs in T20s and given the slot he holds in the side’s batting unit, the player has to become a must have one for this tie.</p>
                            <h3>KAT vs DEB Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>A major reason for Delhi’s consummate success yesterday was the side’s captain Eoin Morgan with the player doing the brunt of the scoring for his side to see them canter to a relatively easy win in the end. Opener Paul Stirling will be partnering him up for the day given the 5,278 runs he’s tallied up in 210 T20 encounters which have made him the fulcrum of Ireland’s batting unit.</p>
                            <p>We have Angelo Matthews come in as well from the setup while from the other side we are moving in for Upul Tharanga and opener Hashim Amla. Opening day of the third edition of the league made one thing blatantly clear to us. This is going to be a league where choosing all the top-order bats is the way to move forward with the players coming down from number 4 extremely unlikely to get time out on the track.</p>
                            <h3>KAT vs DEB Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Just the one all-rounder for us in this docket of our side in the form of Delhi’s David Willey. The player is a resplendent performer especially in the shortest format of the game where he’s regarded as a specialist owing to his ability to encapsulate his traits with both the bat and ball in unison.</p>
                            <h3>KAT vs DEB Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>We are bringing in the two bowlers from Delhi Bulls in the culminating segment of our outfit with us choosing a seamless blend of pace and spin. While legspinner Adil Rashid is always likely to entice the batsmen with his rotations, air and dip to induce false shots, Dushmantha Chameera picked up the only wicket Delhi managed to snare yesterday to see us go for this duo.</p>
                            <p>From the other side meanwhile, Kesrick Williams will be bringing an end to our Dream 11 unit given the player’s capabilities to come out and play pivotal cameos with the bat as well.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to move in with Charles as our side’s captain for the encounter while Morgan is the vice-captain.</p>
