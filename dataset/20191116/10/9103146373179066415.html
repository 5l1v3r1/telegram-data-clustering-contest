      <p><b>2021 TOTAL Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers</b><br/><br/>Tomorrow, 4pm<br/><br/>Venue: Namboole<br/><br/>Uganda   v   Malawi<br/><br/><b>With one of their best starts ever to a Nations Cup campaign, Uganda can’t be better motivated as it heads to its second group game.</b><br/><br/>Coach Jonathan McKinstry registered a huge away result, holding Burkina Faso, and should tomorrow lead the Cranes to the Group B summit when they host Malawi at Namboole.<br/><br/>It will be the Irishman’s first competitive match in charge at home since being appointed last month.<br/><br/>McKinstry’s record has up to this point been impressive, starting off with an away win over Ethiopia before Wednesday’s draw with group favourites Burkina Faso.<br/><br/>Burkina Faso is 19 places better than 79th placed Uganda on the Coca Cola FIFA rankings. The Stallions have also in recent years been more regular in the final tournament of Africa’s top football competition.<br/><br/>McKinstry was yesterday vibrant ahead of Sunday’s fixture.<br/><br/>“It is one point collected. We need 11 more points to be fully assured of making it to the 2021 AFCON finals.<br/><br/>: When we played against Burkina Faso away, we were under pressure but at home am hopeful we want to show our fans the desire that we have.</p>

      <p> <br/>The players will fight for their nation so expect a good match and all we need is your support. The Journey to AFCON is simple. You win your home games and pick up others away.”<br/><br/>Malawi currently tops the group after beating South Sudan in their opening game.<br/><br/>But the Cranes, who have in recent years been known more for their defensive approach, will have to be more attack-minded against Malawi.<br/><br/>Uganda nevertheless holds a statistical advantage over Malawi, having won 14 of its encounters with The Flames, drawn six and lost eight.</p>

      <p> <br/>The last match between the two sides was an international friendly that ended in a goalless draw.<br/><br/>McKinstry’s quest for a more creative formation was in Ouagadougou evident right from defense where he dropped Hassan Wasswa for Timothy Awany.<br/><br/>Awany went on to show that he was a worthwhile introduction by fitting in perfectly with Murshid Juuko in central defense.<br/><br/>The defensive midfield roles of Mike Azira and Khalid Aucho will also have to be revised with the former assigned a more attacking role.</p>
