      <p>My latest transfixion is <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latina/Ceviche-Recipes-37630999">ceviche</a>, and my favorite part of the dish is what's known as <i>leche de tigre</i>. Leche de tigre, or tiger's milk, is the Peruvian term for the citrus-based marinade that cures the seafood in a ceviche. Also known as <i>leche de pantera</i>, this leftover fish runoff usually contains lime juice, sliced onion, chiles, salt, and pepper â€” along with a bit of fish juice. In Peru, the invigorating potion is often served alongside ceviche in a small glass and believed to be both a hangover cure as well as an aphrodisiac.</p>
