      <p>According to the management, Enam never collapsed on stage as being alleged by many media portals. She was at the venue throughout the crowning ceremony.</p>

        <i>The management of BIE CONCEPTS (Believe In ENAM) has received with shock a news item making rounds on social media and other websites after the finals of GMB’19 last Sunday at the Accra International Conference Center on the above subject matter.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>We would like to state unequivocally clear that our beautiful queen ENAM, never collapsed and rushed to any hospital in an ambulance after EKUA was announced the GMB’19 WINNER.</i>

        <b>THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The eloquent ENAM was hospitalized on Wednesday prior to the finals until Sunday evening of that faithful day. Doctors of the health facility had arranged for a standby ambulance and paramedics for ENAM because her health was not excellent which they can’t leave anything to chance. It may be observed that ENAM was not of herself on stage and had to receive medical attention intermittently during the live show.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>After the show, ENAM had to be sent back to the hospital to continue her medication and not because she collapsed. We would like to appeal to all and Sundry to disregard the said news item and treat it as false.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>ENAM has since been discharged from the hospital and has recorded her first public video to thank ALL GHANAIANS who supported and prayed for her to reach that far.</i>
