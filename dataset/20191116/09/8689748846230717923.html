      <p>The lifespan of contemporary marriages can be linked to that of female Anopheles mosquitoes taking into consideration couples’ obsession to their mobile phones instead of offering companionship, rapper Okyeame Kwame has observed.</p>
      <p>According to Okyeame Kwame in an interview with Citi FM’s Jessica Opare Saforo, he chose to tackle phubbing (the practice of ignoring one’s companion in order to pay attention to one’s phone) because it is the number one reason for most problems in relationships in the world.</p>
      <p>In one of his songs called ‘Dum Fon No’, the Rap Dacta tells the story of a married man asking his wife to put off her phone and pay attention to him. As a reminder, ‘Dum Fon No’, taken off the ‘Made in Ghana’ album features Yaa Yaa.</p>
