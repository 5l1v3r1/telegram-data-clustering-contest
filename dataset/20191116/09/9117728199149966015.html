      <p><i>"It's just as hard to win these races that are coming up, but it's almost a different approach for me now because you can be a little bit more aggressive and try some different strategies and different ways in how you go about the weekend and the processes,"</i> Hamilton was quoted by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/hamilton-freebies-mercedes-brazil-abu-dhabi/4597779/"><i>Motorsport.com</i></a>. </p>

      <p>It will be interesting to see how much Mercedes experiment with for 2020. They will still want to try and win the races and end the season as well as it started. </p>
