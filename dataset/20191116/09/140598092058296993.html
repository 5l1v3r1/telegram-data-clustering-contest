      <h1>Gareth Southgate confident Raheem Sterling-Joe Gomez incident will not affect team spirit as injury forces latter out of Kosovo game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:35:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/sam-wallace/" target="_blank">Sam Wallace</a></address>
      <p>The Liverpool defender Joe Gomez withdrew from the England squad for Sunday's game against Kosovo with Gareth Southgate adamant the team’s spirit ahead of Euro 2020 will survive Raheem Sterling’s attack on the Liverpool defender this week.</p>
      <p>Gomez pulled out of the trip to Pristina on Saturday morning having failed to shake off a knee injury picked up in a training ground challenge with Kieran Trippier on Friday and returned to his club along with Jordan Henderson who has a viral infection. Southgate had hoped to play Gomez in the final Euro 2020 qualifier following the booing for the 22-year-old at Wembley on Thursday night, over the incident that led to Sterling’s one-match suspension.</p>
      <p>Southgate said after the game that he has spoken to Sterling at length, and that the Manchester City man will start the Kosovo game. Southgate also said that he believed the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/england-right-take-entitled-hecklers-task-joe-gomez-bond-fans/"> squad’s spirit that was such a crucial part of their progress </a>to the World Cup semi-finals last year remained intact and he even went as far as to claim that having to deal with the Sterling incident will “strengthen the bond” between the players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/joe-gomez-left-devastated-wembley-boos-gareth-southgate-seeks/">There is still major upset on the part of Gomez</a>, an innocent party in the attack by Sterling in the canteen at St George’s Park on Monday. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/14/booed-came-wrong-raheem-sterling-condemns-fans-turned-joe/">Sterling tweeted on Thursday night</a> to condemn the booing and emphasise that Gomez “hasn’t done anything wrong”. Southgate spent time with Gomez and his family and friends in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/14/england-vs-montenegro-euro-2020-qualifier-live-score-latest/">7-0 win over Montenegro</a> to reassure the defender after he was booed by sections of the Wembley crowd when he came on as a late substitute.</p>
      <p>Southgate said: “What I sensed from the questions I got in the last two days, is so far removed from the team I’m seeing socialise and train together, it’s incredible. So, they are so tight. We’ve seen Raheem’s posts regarding Joe and I had a long chat with Raheem [on Thursday]. He’s looking forward to Sunday’s game.”</p>

      <p>He said that in spite of the jeering at Gomez when he came on, a reaction the player had first sensed when he warmed up before the game, he felt that it had been important for the defender to come on because he had not been given game time in the September and October qualifiers. “If anything, I think it will just strengthen the bond of the players,” Southgate said. “That’s the team, they’re going through lots of different experiences with Bulgaria and with Montenegro that are only bringing them closer together as a group.”</p>
      <p>There remain misgivings on Gomez’s part about his treatment first at the hands of Sterling and subsequently when it was felt he was not fully exonerated as the innocent party. Following the booing at Wembley the player and his family were visited by Southgate and his coach Chris Powell privately. Southgate has had to placate both parties, also trying his best to rehabilitate Sterling and the situation remains delicate.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, when asked about Sterling, Southgate was upbeat. “[Sterling’s] Good, he’s looking forward to it [Kosovo game,” Southgate said. “You’re going to have moments as a manager with the players, where they’ll be enamoured with you, they’ll be less enamoured with you but we know we’ve been through enough already that the bonds are tight with the whole team. So, yes, we just have to ignore everything else and make sure the team stay tight, the team keep improving and we develop everybody as strong as we possibly can.”</p>
      <p>Southgate said that the squad would not spend the tournament in splendid isolation at the Football Association’s remote St George’s Park facility even though they could potentially play up to five games at Wembley. He also said that they might prepare for Euro 2020 with a trip overseas and friendly matches would not necessarily be against European sides as has been the case in the past when there has been an emphasis on finding the right profile of opponent. </p>
      <p>“Sometimes the emotion of … you draw Ivory Coast [at a World Cup] and you play Tunisia [in a friendly] because they’re African, I’m not so sure that is really relevant for some,” he said. “I think we just want good quality opposition who are going to test you in every aspect of your game.”</p>
      <p>Kosovo coach Bernard Challandes said that his side - who lost 5-3 to England at St Mary's in September - might have to break Sterling's leg to stop him. But he was joking. </p>
