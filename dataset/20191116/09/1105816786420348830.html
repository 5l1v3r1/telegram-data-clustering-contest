      <p>“It is a huge honour to have been chosen by a production house like Yash Raj Films as their heroine,” <i>The Indian Express</i> quoted the former Miss World as saying. “I am thoroughly happy and thrilled about the learnings that I will have through this journey. My life, so far, has been a fairy tale. From becoming Miss India and then Miss World to now getting such a big project as my debut film… it’s like a new, exciting chapter of my life.”</p>
      <p>Prithviraj is based on the 12th century Indian monarch Prithviraj Chauhan. While Kumar will essay the titular role, Chhillar will play the role of his wife Sanyogita. The film will be helmed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi, known for writing and directing 1991 television series <i>Chanakya</i> and Urmila Matondkar’s 2003 film <i>Pinjar</i>.</p>

      <p>Excited about bagging the role, Chhillar added, “It is a huge responsibility to play princess Sanyogita. She was a powerful personality and stood up for what is right and took the most important decisions by herself. Her life is an extremely important chapter in Indian history and I will try my best to play her as accurately as possible.”</p>
      <p>Talking about Chhillar’ casting, Dwivedi said, “We auditioned a lot of young, fresh faces for the role because we were looking for a stunningly gorgeous Indian heroine. While Sanyogita was an incredibly beautiful person, she was also a strong, confident girl. We were looking to find someone who could match her magnetic persona and found that in Manushi. She has been rehearsing six days a week since then.”</p>
      <p><i>Prithiviraj</i> is scheduled to hit theatres around Diwali 2020.</p>
