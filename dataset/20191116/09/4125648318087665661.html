      <p>“During the attacks of the Turkish occupation and its mercenaries on the front lines where the Syriac Military Council were stationed, and the areas outside the agreements, two of our fighters were martyred and six were injured,” ANHA reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Despite the declaration of a ceasefire in northern Syria by the U.S. administration, the Turkish-backed forces have not halted their attacks against the SDF and their allies.</p>
      <p>These continued attacks by the Turkish-backed forces have resulted in increased bloodshed and a large number of displaced civilians.</p>
