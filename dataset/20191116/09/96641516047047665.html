      <h1>The Morning After: iFixit looks inside the 16-inch MacBook Pro</h1>
      <h2>And Disney+ will fix its old 'Simpson's episodes next year.</h2>

      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>Welcome to your weekend! Now that Apple's new laptop is here, it's time to tear it apart and look inside. Disney is responding to <i>Simpsons</i> fans, and Amazon has a new high-quality Echo speaker. Finally, there's a new episode of the Engadget Podcast and we'll look back at some highlights from this week like our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/motorola-razr-foldable-hands-on-preview-2019/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">hands-on with Motorola's new foldable RAZR</a>.</p>

      <p>Naturally, the teardown team at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/16-inch-macbook-pro-magic-keyboard-throwback">iFixit</a> was bound to get their hands on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-specs-pricing-hands-on-video/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> and see exactly how its keyboard works. Just as expected, the new keyboard is nearly identical to the one in the 2015 MacBook Pro as well as Apple's external Bluetooth Magic Keyboard.</p>

      <p>In a repeat of an issue that occurred when FXX started playing old Simpsons episodes a few years ago, someone decided to crop and zoom older content so it fills out an HD widescreen frame. In a statement, a Disney spokesperson <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/simpsons-disney-plus-aspect-ratio/">said that "in early 2020" it will offer a toggle</a> for the first 19 seasons of episodes so people can choose to view them in their original format -- important for many visual gags that extend to the top or bottom of the frame.</p>

      <p>To get the most out of this Echo Studio, Billy Steele writes that you'll want to consider a high-res streaming plan like Amazon Music HD. The 3D audio options are a bit limited for now, but even regular Spotify sounds great on this thing. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/echo-studio-review/">It's by far the best-sounding Echo yet</a>, and probably will be for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <p>According to statistics, the average household has 1.8 to 2 cars. It depends on who you ask, but let's just accept that there are more families that have two cars than have one. Roberto Baldwin makes the argument that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/second-car-ev/">if you have two vehicles, at least one of them should be something like a fun-to-drive Mini SE or Model 3</a>.</p>

      <p>This is the second time this year the company has raised its rate on live television streaming. In February, there was a $5/month hike to $45.99 -- up from the $39.99 price when the service debuted in 2017. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/hulu-live-tv-price-increase/">Now it's going up to $54.99, as of December 18th</a>.</p>
