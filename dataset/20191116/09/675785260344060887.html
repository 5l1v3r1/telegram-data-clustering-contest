      <h2>Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk admits treatment of team-mate Joe Gomez after his clash with Raheem Sterling has been "disappointing"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:53:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk has called on people to leave team-mate Joe Gomez alone after his clash with Raheem Sterling on England duty.</p>
      <p>Gomez was an innocent party in the clash which saw Sterling left out of England's win over Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender was involved in a bust-up with Sterling at England training camp on Monday, less than 24 hours after the Reds had defeated <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in a crucial Premier League clash.</p>
      <p>Whilst Sterling took all responsibility and was dropped, Gomez was booed when he made his way onto the pitch in a 7-0 win.</p>
      <p>The incident has shone a light on the intense rivalry currently ongoing between title-chasing Liverpool and City - and Van Dijk admits he found the incident "disappointing".</p>

      <p>Speaking on international duty with the Netherlands and asked about England supporters' treatment towards Gomez, Van Dijk said: "It's disappointing to see.</p>
      <p>"I want to say as well it's been dealt with. I think everyone should stop talking about it because it's just a thing that happened.</p>
      <p>"They all sorted it out. Everyone needs to move on, leave Joe especially alone. But yes, it was disappointing to see."</p>

      <p>Gomez has since been withdrawn from England's squad to take on Kosovo on Sunday night due to a knock picked up in training, with Jordan Henderson also out with a viral infection.</p>
      <p>Neither have travelled to Kosovo with Raheem Sterling in line for a recall and Liverpool facing an anxious wait to see if they will be fit for their next game.</p>
      <p>Premier League action resumes next weekend with Liverpool travelling to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> and Manchester City host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
