      <p>Actress Bhumi Pednekar says her on screen ‘jodi’ with actor Ayushmann Khurrana, with whom she has worked in hits like “<i>Dum Laga Ke Haisha</i>“, “<i>Shubh Mangal Saavdhan</i>” and “<i>Bala</i>“, is definitely fortunate.</p>
      <p>“Ayushmann and I are definitely a fortunate on-screen jodi to be getting so much love and adulation for audiences. We complement each other as artistes and we do have a very good on-screen chemistry. It just shows and I’m just glad that people have loved us as a pair and we have just done three films together,” Bhumi said.</p>

      <p>Recently, both grooved to the tunes of Bhumi’s song <i>Dheeme Dheeme</i> alongside Kartik Aaryan and Ananya Panday from their upcoming film, <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i>.</p>
      <p>“Chandani Raat main.. Hero @ayushmannk ke saath main.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DheemeDheeme?src=hashtag_click">#DheemeDheeme</a> Thank you AK for always just being the best. Love Love Love you,” tweeted Bhumi.</p>

      <p>She says both of them have grown as actors during the course of their three back-to-back films.</p>
      <p>“From ‘<i>Dum Lag Ke Haisha</i>‘ (dealing with body shaming) to ‘Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan’ (about erectile dysfunction in men) to ‘Bala’ (about premature balding and the stereotyping that dark-skinned women face in India), we have only been paired in films that tackle taboo topics so I think the equity of our pairing lies in bringing out real, societal issues told in the most honest and entertaining manner possible,” she added.</p>
      <p>Bhumi says she is thrilled with the box office run that they are having as a pair.</p>
