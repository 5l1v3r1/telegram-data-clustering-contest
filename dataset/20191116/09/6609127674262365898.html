      <p>The former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14919/kilmarnock/">Kilmarnock</a> manager admits he was flattered to even be considered.</p>
      <p>But asked about being linked with a return to club football, Clarke insisted he is fully focused on qualification for the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the qualifier in Cyprus, he said: “How did I react? I read the paper then I got on with my job here. If you get linked with a job then it means you are either doing something right or you’ve done something right before.</p>
      <p>“It’s always good to get linked, but this is my job and I am 100 per cent committed to getting Scotland to Euro 2020.</p>

      <p>“You can never categorically say anything, as you never know what could happen in life. Real Madrid might tempt me!</p>
      <p>“But do I feel this is the start of something here? Absolutely.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to get to the Euros and that is my main objective in the first part of my Scotland career. If I get that long! Sometimes it’s taken out of your hands.</p>
      <p>“It’s a different job. It’s going to take a little bit of time before I get used to being an international manager.</p>
      <p>“There’s still a lot of me that wants to be out working on the training pitch every day. That’s what I do best, but I’ll get better.</p>
      <p>“Different can be perceived as difficult, but it’s just different. I’ll find a way to make it work.”</p>
      <p>Clarke’s <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> face Cyprus in Nicosia this afternoon, with Hearts star Steven Naismith set to captain the team on his 50th cap.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Aberdeen</a> defender Scott McKenna will return to the line-up after missing the last four qualifying games.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> midfielder Ryan Jack also comes into contention, with Clarke challenging everyone in his squad to stake a claim ahead of the Euro play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve got good players, good ability.</p>
      <p>“All of them have been in the camp at some stage. Only young Ryan Porteous, who joined us late, is not used to me around the place or how we work.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to a good game and it is a really big chance for the 23 who are here to cement their place in March’s squad.</p>
      <p>“We are going into our fourth camp together now. We are trying to get in place a team structure that, no matter what the personnel is, players who come in for certain positions understand what their role is for the team.”</p>
      <p>Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay, Ryan Fraser and Liam Cooper<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4944522/robertson-cooper-fraser-mctominay-scotland-out/"> all withdrew from Clarke’s squad through injury.</a></p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve been that way even in my club management. When people have been out injured, I haven’t tended to be a manager who hangs around the treatment room and tries<br/>to drag people off the treatment table.</p>
      <p>“If they are out, they are out. You just have to deal with the ones you have got.”</p>
