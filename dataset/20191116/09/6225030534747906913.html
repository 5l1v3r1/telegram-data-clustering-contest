      <p><b>Welder</b> moved out of a tie for second for most wins in a row at Remington Park, winning for the ninth consecutive race here by taking the <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/stakes/Silver_Goblin">Silver Goblin Stakes</a></b> for Oklahoma-breds, 3-year-and olds and older. He is now only two away from the all-time leader Slide Show, who won 11 straight in the mid-1990s.</p>
      <p>This 6-year-old gelded son of The Visualiser made it look like he was dancing softly across the finish line as jockey David Cabrera had him well in hand, drawing off by a city block to win the $70,000 Silver Goblin Stakes for the third year in a row. The final winning margin for the 6-1/2 furlongs sprint was 11 lengths over runner-up D Toz, who was another length ahead of third-place Gospel Cherokey. The winning time was 1:16.03 for the 6-1/2 furlongs over a fast track.</p>
      <p>“This is a nice horse,” Cabrera said of Welder. “It was just a breeze for him. You asked me one time who my favorite horse I’ve ever ridden was, I think this is it.”</p>
      <p>Welder’s third win of the Silver Goblin Stakes ties him with most wins in this stakes with Okie Ride, who won it in 2012, 2013 and 2016.</p>
      <p>Clayton Rash, owner of Ra-Max Farms in Claremore, Okla., who has had this horse since he and trainer Teri Luneack found him hiding in the corner of his stall as a yearling, praised Luneack for her magical touch with this horse.</p>
      <p>“She really does have an amazing rapport with Welder,” said Rash. “The way she knows horses and has charisma. We couldn’t have a better fit for this horse. I have the ultimate faith and confidence in her.”</p>
      <p>Cabrera had a plan coming into this race, but Welder had made plans of his own.</p>
      <p>“It was 6-1/2 furlongs, so I decided I wanted to take him back a little bit,” said Cabrera, the leading rider at Remington Park. “So when I tried to take him back, he just grabbed the bit and said, ’No, we ain’t going back.’ I just let him do what he wants to do and that’s when he runs his best race.”</p>
      <p>The fact that Welder moved one win closer to arguably the greatest filly to run here, Slide Show, had Luneack feeling sentimental over her gray streak of lightning.</p>
      <p>“It means everything,” she said. “I mean this horse is so special.’</p>
      <p>Welder added $42,000 to his bankroll after winning for the 21st time in 31 career starts. He also has four seconds and four thirds. His lifetime earnings are now $970,998.</p>
      <p>“We’ll have to see if there’s anything that he would be eligible for the rest of the meet,” Luneack said. “We would like it very much if he could break the $1 million-mark at Remington Park.”</p>
      <p>Welder set fractions of :22.28 for the quarter-mile, :44.69 for the half-mile, and 1:09.19 for three-quarters of a mile. He paid $2.10 to, $2.10 to place and $2.10 to show.</p>
      <p>Rash said, despite the fact he and Luneack were able to purchase him as part of a package of about six horses for $6,400 apiece, the owner that sold him wanted $12,000 for him as a throw-in. But Rash didn’t build an international welding company without knowing how to negotiate.</p>
      <p>“I think I would have paid the $12,000 for him then, but this was negotiating,” he said. “Someone could come up and offer me $1 million for him now and I wouldn’t take it. I really wouldn’t.”</p>
      <p>Welder was bred in Oklahoma by Center Hills Farm in Pryor, the same farm that produced $3 million winner Kip Deville.</p>
      <p>The Silver Goblin Stakes is named after the gray Oklahoma-bred millionaire who won multiple stakes races at Remington Park and numerous graded stakes events around the nation, in a career spanning 1993-1999.</p>
