      <p>EVERETT — The Everett Silvertips climbed out of an early two-goal deficit, only to see their own two-goal lead dissipate in the third period in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Winnipeg Ice on Saturday at Angel of the Winds Arena.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg’s Chase Hartje batted in a rebound for the game-winning goal just 39 seconds into overtime.</p>
      <p>The loss snapped a four-game win streak for the Silvertips (13-4-1), who still lead the U.S. Division with 27 points.</p>
      <p>The Ice cut Everett’s lead to 4-3 with Jackson Leppard’s goal at the 7:58 mark in the third period. Nino Kinder snapped a shot past Silvertips goaltender Keegan Karki with just 40.6 seconds remaining in regulation to tie the game.</p>
      <p>Silvertips linemates Michal Gut, Jackson Berezowski and Brendan Lee each recorded a goal and an assist in the loss.</p>
