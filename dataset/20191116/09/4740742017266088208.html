      <h1>The theories behind why Bristol is called Bristol</h1>
      <h2>It hasn't always had the same name</h2>

      <p>Ah Bristol. It’s a city, a county and a state of mind.</p>
      <p>It’s given its name to a car, a way of tidying and making secure, a way of categorising poo and a rhyming slang for breasts.</p>
      <p>As a place, it’s been replicated across the world, from Peru to Canada. Here in the original Bristol, the word Bristol is said so much it’s easy to forget what it means as a word.</p>
      <p>So what does it mean? We know it so well, but where does the word Bristol come from?</p>
      <p>Just as Bristol itself is a city of contrasts and diversity, the word itself has several different theories to its origin.</p>
      <p>Firstly, it never used to be called Bristol. The very first ‘city’ was up in Leigh Woods, in a beautiful spot with the Avon Gorge on one side, Nightingale Valley on the other, and defended on a third side by a bank and ditch fort.</p>

      <p>Back in those Celtic British and Roman days, the place was called Caer Odor, which is said to mean ‘the city of the gap’ - and it’s probable the gap in this case refers to Avon Gorge.</p>
      <p>Back in those days, before the Saxons came, the people living around the river spoke an early form of Welsh, but a proposed etymology for Bristol comes from further afield. The Irish had a strong influence in Bristol’s history - it was closely linked through trade, and St Patrick himself was originally from these parts before being taken to Ireland as a slave.</p>
      <p>One theory that has been proposed is that Bristol’s name is Irish - from the two words Braos and Tuile, which apparently mean a ‘stream through a chasm’.</p>
      <p>But while this theory has bubbled up into a few online lists, it appears to have no basis in reality.</p>
      <p>Etymologists and language experts tend to base their theories on tracing the changing ways names were spelled through time - and it is by doing this we can sort their origins.</p>
      <p>Back in medieval times, Bristol had a variety of spellings, which often included a ‘C’ or a ‘G’ after the ‘Bri’.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the word ‘Brygstow’ or ‘Brigstow’ is in use in the city today, albeit in a kind of renewal rather than survival.</p>
      <p>This supports the theory Bristol evolved from the two early English words for Bridge and Stow (meaning meeting place).</p>

      <p>So Bristol simply means ‘the meeting place at the bridge’. The spot across the River Avon roughly where Bristol Bridge stands now is likely to have had a bridge for millennia, and the early town - which boasted a huge population of around 10,000 back in the 13th century - would have grown up around that key crossing point.</p>
      <p>But we're not quite done - how this became ‘Bristol’ is a matter of some debate.</p>
      <p>The story goes that everyone else called it, and wrote it as Brigstow, or Bristow, but because Bristolians have a penchant for adding the letter ‘L’ to the end of vowel-ending words, that morphed over time into Bristol.</p>
      <p>However, Brian Iles, who has spent decades researching the unique ‘Terminal L’ in the Bristol dialect, isn’t convinced.</p>
      <p>He said there is no definitive evidence of the Terminal L being in use in Bristol before the 19th century, centuries after Bristow became Bristol.</p>
      <p>So, we're all clear now, yes? Good.</p>
