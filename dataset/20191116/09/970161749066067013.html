      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a> have both been doing their bit for prisoners this week, as the power couple both visited inmates in Texas.</p>
      <p>The reality star, 39, who is training to become a criminal justice lawyer, revealed she had met with death row inmate Rodney Reed as he found out his execution had been halted.</p>
      <p>Rodney, 51, was facing death by lethal injection on Wednesday for the murder of a 19-year-old woman in 1996.</p>
      <p>Kim shared the news with her followers, explaining: ‘Today, I had the honor of meeting #RodneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration.</p>
      <p>‘Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney’s case.</p>

      <p>‘We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms. We have heard people all around the globe speak up.</p>
      <p>‘And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime – especially one punishable by death – deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered.</p>

      <p>‘So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay!’</p>
      <p>Since beginning her legal training, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/05/prison-inmate-kim-kardashian-advocated-will-walk-free-serving-23-years-murder-10868072/">Kim has worked in the area of prison reform, helping a number of falsely accused prisoners</a>, including Alice Marie Johnson who had been given a life sentence for a first-time drug offense, be released.</p>

      <p>Kim is planning to take her legal exams in 2022 and has been involved in a number of high-profile cases where people have claimed there was a miscarriage of justice.</p>
      <p>She wasn’t the only member of the Kardashian-West family doing her bit for the greater good though – Kanye also brought his famed Sunday Service to the prisoners at a Houston jail.</p>

      <p>Law enforcement sources told TMZ that Kanye had reached out a few days earlier to bring 100 choir and band members along to perform for the inmates as the jail has a very popular religious program.</p>
      <p>Kanye and his choir’s visit was a surprise to everyone but the people involved in putting it together and the jail shared a touching video of his visit.</p>
