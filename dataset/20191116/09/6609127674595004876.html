      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> striker grabbed his 23rd goal of the season and his first for Colombia in his fifth appearance by netting an injury time winner in a 1-0 victory against Peru in Florida.</p>

      <p>Morelos, 23, pounced to bury a rebound and helped Carlos Queiroz's side to a win against their fellow South American opponents in Miami.</p>
      <p>And the Ibrox ace was thrilled to get off the mark.</p>
      <p>He said: "The goal was just intuition on my part, but it feels great to score my first ever goal for my country especially so late in the game.</p>
      <p>"It's always a huge honour to play for my country and I feel very proud I was able to score too.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't the best game in the world, but the important thing was to get the win.</p>
      <p>"I have always said it was important for me to score my country and it's another step on what has been a great season for me so far at Rangers.</p>
      <p>"And now I have scored my first goal, I hope to go on and score many, many more."</p>
      <p>Morelos will be hoping to add to his tally on Tuesday when Colombia face Ecuador in New Jersey.</p>
