            <b>AFGH vs WI Dream11 : Afghanistan Vs West Indies Probable Playing 11, Pitch Report, Player Stats, Match Details and Best Dream 11 Team.</b>
          </p>
          <p>As it turns out, the 2<sup>nd</sup> match of the T20I series between Afghanistan and Windies will serve as a must-win contest for the former after West Indies registered a comprehensive 30 runs victory in the opening encounter. It was a sensational knock from Evin Lewis which helped the visiting team to register a competitive score of 164 in their allotted 20 overs.</p>
          <p>The Caribbean bowling department was well up to the mark and managed to restrict the strong Afghans to a mediocre score of 134/9 in their 20 overs. It was a great bowling performance by the Caribbeans especially on the back of a match-winning spell of 3/17 by Kesrick Williams. The 2<sup>nd</sup> encounter will be played at the same venue in Lucknow and we should be up for a great contest tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Afghanistan has defeated Windies in the past and the Caribbeans will be wary of the fact and will look to put them under immense pressure in their must-win clash. The Afghans being the host nation has lost all 4 matches so far and will look to restore some of their lost pride.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions and Toss</h3>
                <p>It has been a high scoring venue in Lucknow and we should witness much of the same tomorrow. There has been something on offer for the new ball bowlers but overall it is a high scoring venue and in all likelihood, we should witness a run-fest tomorrow. The team batting first might look to chase as dew might come into effect in the latter part of the game.</p>

                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream 11 Wicket-keeper</h3>
                            <p>Denesh Ramdin should be a sensible pick as the wicket-keeper. In the absence of Nicholas Pooran, the veteran wicket-keeper batsman has made a return to the national team. In the opening clash, he scored a fluent 20 of 19 deliveries and looked very safe behind the wickets. He should be our best available options among wicket-keeper</p>
                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream 11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Evin Lewis is a powerful striker of the ball and made his presence felt in the previous clash when he smashed a blistering 68 of 41 deliveries. The innings proved to be decisive in the end. Shimron Hetmyer is a dasher and can change the complexion of any match in a matter of few deliveries. He scored 21 in the previous clash and will look to make amends in the 2<sup>nd</sup> T20I.</p>
                            <p>Hazratuallah Zazai had a relatively off day in the previous encounter when he managed to score just 23 of 29 deliveries. However, Zazai has proved his credentials in the past. Zazai smashed 162 of 62 deliveries against Ireland not too long ago.</p>
                            <p>Asghar Afghan is the best batsman in the Afghanistan team and his solidity is a must in the middle overs. Over the years he has been a prolific run-scorer for the Asian minnows. He scored 25 of 21 deliveries in the previous clash which included a couple of fours and a six.</p>
                            <p>Najibullah Zadran is another impressive customer for Afghanistan. He is a powerful striker of the ball and is a good option in any team. In the opening clash the southpaw smashed 27 of 22 deliveries which included 3 fours and a six.</p>
                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream 11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p>Kieron Pollard has been listed as an all-rounder but he hardly bowls these days so he could be omitted. On the flip side, we can include Jason Holder who will finish his quota of overs and can also smash some lusty blows at the lower half of the batting order.</p>
                            <p>Gulbadin Naib has been a good performer for Afghanistan. He led them in the ICC World Cup not long ago. Gulbadin bagged a couple of important wickets in the previous clash and is an option for the death overs.</p>
                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream 11 Bowlers</h3>
                            <p>Rashid Khan doesn’t need an introduction. He has been a sensation for Afghanistan in the last 4-5 years and will look to make an impact in the series. Rashid gave away 34 runs in 4 overs bagging a solitary wicket in the previous clash. For a champion like him, a match-winning performance could be just around the corner.</p>
                            <p>Kesrick Williams has been a find for Windies especially in the shortest format of the game. His change-ups have made life difficult for the opposition batters. Even in the previous clash, Kesrick Williams was the pick of the Windies bowlers bagging 2/17 in his allotted 4 overs.</p>
                            <p>Mujeeb-ur Rahman will be the last bowler in my team. He has a lot of varieties up his sleeve and will look to make an impact in the all-important clash. He bagged a wicket for 27 runs in the previous clash.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Evin Lewis will be the captain of the day while Rashid Khan will be the vice-captain.</p>
