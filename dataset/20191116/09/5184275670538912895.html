      <p>Actress Lili Reinhart has opened up about her “frustrating” battle with anxiety and depression, saying it has taken time to realise she was “just a human who’s feeling something in a different way than some other people would”.</p>
      <p>The “Riverdale” actress spoke to Glamour magazine about her mental health struggles, sharing her difficulties are still very much ongoing, reports aceshowbiz.com.</p>
      <p>“I’ve experienced depression and anxiety. Not constantly, but I’m still experiencing it,” she explained. “I have spells of time where I feel completely unmotivated, I don’t want to do anything and I question myself. I don’t know how to handle stress very well.</p>

      <p>“I find that talking about it and sharing my experience with other people, and reminding myself that I’m not alone has been incredibly therapeutic.”</p>
      <p>She started seeing a therapist in her teens, when she was struggling with “incredible social anxiety”, and reflected that opening up to someone about her problems allowed her “to be understood” — something she found so helpful that she continues to go to therapy today.</p>
      <p>“The goal for me has been to always leave therapy feeling a couple of inches taller,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Feeling like I’ve alleviated myself of a problem by learning how to solve it. Not everything has a straight answer – it’s not just going to take one session – but I start to think, ‘I’ve grown, I’ve done this, I’ve figured this out, now can I go off into the world and try to put what I’ve learned into action’.</p>
      <p>“That’s how I look at therapy. I am not crazy, and I am not problematic. I am just a human who’s feeling something in a different way than some other people would.”</p>
      <p>How her relationship with her anxiety is now, she said: “Frustrating.”</p>
      <p>“It’s something that I’ve accepted, but I don’t understand it,” she added, before saying that she’s taken to writing lists to help her rationalise any problem that feels overwhelming.</p>
