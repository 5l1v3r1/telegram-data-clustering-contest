      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese actress Erika Sawajiri, famous for her role in 2005 drama “1 Litre of Tears”, has been arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs, NHK reported on Saturday citing unnamed sources.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old actress, who this year starred in a TV adaption of Toyoko Yamasaki’s hit novel “Shiroi Kyoto”, was arrested in Tokyo on suspicion of possessing ecstasy, although few other details are known, NHK said.</p>
      <p>Tear-jerker “1 Litre of Tears” made Sawajiri famous not only in Japan but across Asia with the drama’s depiction of its heroine’s physical deterioration from a rare disease.</p>
      <p>Drug arrests are treated seriously in Japan with celebrities who are caught frequently edited out of movies and TV shows.</p>
      <p>The Tokyo police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sawajiri’s talent agency was not immediately reachable for comment.</p>
