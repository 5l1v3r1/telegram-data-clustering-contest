        <b>Police say a 16-year-old boy who killed two teenagers after opening fire on students at a high school in California has died.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The gunman began his attack at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita after being dropped off by his mother on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Those killed were 15-year-old Gracie Anne Muehlberger and 14-year-old Dominic Blackwell - while two other female victims, aged 14 and 15 and a male victim aged 14 were also injured.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alex Villanueva of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said it "remains a mystery" why the teenager carried out the shooting, which came on his 16th birthday.</p>
      <p>He said the youngster, who shot himself in the head at the scene of his 16-second rampage, did not appear to have written a manifesto, diary or suicide note.</p>
      <p>The gunman was pronounced dead at 3.32pm local time on Friday, with his mother by his side in hospital after he was taken there in a "grave condition" by ambulance crews.</p>

      <p>Security footage from the school had shown him opening fire after walking into an outdoor plaza, with his targets described as "random" by police.</p>
      <p>Investigators are still trying to find out where he got the gun from, with the teenager said to have handled it with a degree of expertise and counted the rounds he fired.</p>
      <p>The weapon was a semi-automatic pistol, but its origins are still unknown.</p>
      <p>Following the attack, helicopter footage aired on US television showed lines of youngsters with their hands in the air as they filed out of school buildings behind police officers.</p>
      <p>Teresa Figueira, one of around 2,300 students at the school, said: "I was walking with my sister and we were walking into school and then I heard a shot. All of a sudden I saw kids running and I thought it was a joke.</p>
      <p>"Then I saw my sister running saying 'go go go', so I ran and my friend told me to go to his house because he lives on the street. It was terrifying."</p>
      <p>The two girls who were injured during the shooting are still in hospital but are said to be doing well, while the boy who was hurt has been released.</p>
