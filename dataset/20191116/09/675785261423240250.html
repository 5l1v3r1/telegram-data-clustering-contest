      <h2>Kate Garraway, Caitlyn Jenner and James Haskell can all be seen doing their first I'm A Celebrity challenge as they arrive in camp</h2>

      <p>The cast of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 2019 have started landing in the jungle camp, ready to be shut away for two weeks with rats and cockroaches for company.</p>
      <p>The stars were spotted looking a little nervous this morning as they took up their first task: making their way into the rainforest camp.</p>
      <p>Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly were seen presenting together for the first time, concentrating as they watched the famous faces getting to grips with their challenge.</p>
      <p>At one point, Dec raised his arm as though to point something out to his best mate Dec.</p>

      <p>Wearing red shirts to denote the team they're on, Caitlyn Jenner and James Haskell were seen chatting together next to a helicopter before getting into a canoe and paddling their way over to the other shore.</p>
      <p>James took up the front seat in the rickety vessel and tucked a white flower behind his ear before seizing an oar and directing him and Caitlyn to safety.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn looked a little hesitant as she gazed down at the murky water, no doubt hoping not to spot one of the alligators that populate the area.</p>

      <p>Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway was also there, standing with the group as producers told them what they'd be doing.</p>
      <p>She was wearing a bright blue shirt, as was the comedian Andrew Maxwell, who could be seen in the back of a mud-splattered 4x4 with a huge grin on his face.</p>
      <p>Radio presenter Roman Kemp and Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson are also on a team together, both wearing purple shirts.</p>

      <p>And Nadine Coyle joined up with Adele Roberts for the yellow team.</p>
      <p>Ian Wright and Adele shared a hug before the task, with Ian wearing the colour green alongside a nervous Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>It means all 10 of the contestants are still in the programme, with no last-minute pull-outs.</p>

      <p>However, there may still be one late arrival left to come, as ITV bosses love to spring a surprise on the camp.</p>
      <p>Emily Atack could be seen laughing with the camera crew as she filmed for the Extra Camp spin-off, which she'll be hosting with Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas.</p>
