      <p>At ExileCon 2019, Chris Wilson, founder and managing director of Grinding Gear Games took the stage to announce some brand new expansions to the world of <i>Path of Exile</i>. In fantastic news for mobile gamers, <i>Path of Exile Mobile</i> was announced, as well as a version for Mac OS.</p>

      <p><i>Path of Exile</i> for mobile went undated, but the developers indicated that the port would have "zero compromises" when it does finally arrive.</p>

      <p>The gameplay trailer showed off impressive scenes, including a new skill and inventory system neatly optimised for mobile devices. A great romp through Iceberg and battles with Vaal Frost Guardians were shown, as well as a brand new map and travel system.</p>

      <p>But that wasn't the only thing announced â€” <i>Path of Exile</i> will also be coming to Mac OS. That's great news for Mac gamers, who, in the past, have often missed out on large scale RPGs like <i>Path of Exile</i>.</p>
      <p>While both of these releases were teased at ExileCon, neither were dated. <i>Path of Exile Mobile</i> is likely to be hotly anticipated, if the live audience reaction is anything to go by. Stay tuned for the rest of our coverage on ExileCon over the weekend!</p>
