      <p><b>Nations Cup qualifier</b><br/><br/>Tomorrow, 4pm<br/><br/>Uganda v Malawi<br/><br/>South Sudan v Burkina Faso<br/><br/><b>Luwagga Kizito will be considered to start Cranes’ Nations Cup qualifier against Malawi tomorrow following the withdrawal of first choice winger Abdul Lumala.</b><br/><br/>Lumala and Alex Bakka opted out of this home fixture to avoid undermining processes close to granting them citizenship in Sweden.<br/><br/>Both players travelled to Sweden as asylum seekers, and until the pair meets the period set by the authorities in Sweden, Lumala and Bakka can only be involved in Cranes’ games in foreign territory.<br/><br/>Unlike Bakka, who has yet to establish himself in the Cranes fold, Lumala has gradually become an integral part of Cranes’ attacking play.<br/><br/>Lumala is more effective running behind defenders and operating within yards from the opposition’s goalkeeper. That is what Cranes need to prise-open Malawi, and are qualities that will still come from Kazakhstan-based midfielder Kizito.<br/><br/>Kizito thrives on pace and skill to get past his markers, and alongside Farouk Miya and Emmanuel Okwi will be a handful for the Malawians.</p>
