      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-university">Newcastle University</a> is investigating after a student was filmed on Instagram using racist language.</p>
      <p>In the video posted earlier this week, the man can be seen singing down a microphone and shouts the phrases, "I f***ing hate n****s" and another racial slur.</p>
      <p>The student is wearing a university hockey club tie and is surrounded by a number of others in the same attire, <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/newcastle/2019/11/14/i-fcking-hate-nggas-newcastle-uni-student-filmed-chanting-racial-slur-46680">The Tab reports.</a></p>
      <p>The man can be heard laughing throughout the video which was posted on another student's Instagram story.</p>
      <p>The Newcastle University Men's Hockey Club told The Newcastle Tab that they are dealing with the incident.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-university">Newcastle University</a> spokesperson added: “We are appalled by the language used in this video and while investigations are underway some interim disciplinary measures have already been taken.</p>
      <p>“There is no place for racism or racial harassment of any kind at Newcastle University and we are committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all our students and staff.”</p>
