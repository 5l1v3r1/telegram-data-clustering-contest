      <h1>Report claims Xherdan Shaqiri has told friends he is set to depart Liverpool next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:18:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Xherdan Shaqiri has told friends that he will leave Anfield next year, according to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/sources-liverpool-big-name-tells-friends-he-wants-to-quit/">Football Insider</a>, having featured for just 14 minutes this season to date.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Swiss winger has reportedly become frustrated with his lack of action under Jurgen Klopp and recognises that he is never going to get into the team on a regular basis given that Mo Salah is ahead of him in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Klopp will not sanction a move in January, given it is midway through the season, but could let him go next summer, especially if reinforcements arrive.</p>
      <p>It has already been reported that <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/16/borussia-dortmund-name-incredible-jadon-sancho-price-with-claims-made-that-liverpool-lead-the-chase/">the Reds are leading the race for Jadon Sancho</a>, and that would only further inhibit Shaqiri’s opportunities.</p>
      <p>It might seem strange to let Shaqiri go so soon after he arrived from Stoke City, but he is at an age where the Reds could look to cash in. Having paid just £13 million for him, they could also make a decent profit at this stage.</p>
      <p>He has a lot of talent and quality, so no one would be against Shaqiri sticking around, but equally, a move away does not seem too unrealistic in the coming months, all things considered.</p>
