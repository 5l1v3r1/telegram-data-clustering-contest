        <b>Sinn Féin has promised to raise the minimum wage and reduce the cost of insurance if elected to government.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party is meeting in Co Derry on Saturday for its Ard Fheis.</p>
      <p>Free public transport for children and an increase in local Gardaí are also some of the pre-election promises.</p>
      <p>The countdown to an Irish general election and four by-elections top the agenda.</p>
      <p>Brexit, Irish unity and a general election in the UK are also in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Around 2,000 delegates will also vote on the party's deputy leadership.</p>
      <p>The party has outlined 166 motions to debate solutions for critical issues facing citizens across the island of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Party leader Mary Lou McDonald will deliver a keynote speech later.</p>
      <p>A fringe meeting will also take place to discuss the economic merits of a united Ireland with Seamus McGuinness, professor of economic research at the ESRI.</p>
      <p>The Ard Fheis is also debating issues such as the cost of insurance, the cost of childcare, rents and the need to deliver a large-scale public housing programme.</p>
      <p>Finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said addressing rising insurance costs will be a priority.</p>
      <p>"Sinn Féin is the party that will end the insurance rip-off, we are the party that will take on this industry.</p>
      <p>"We'll reduce costs by banning dual pricing that is hitting and hurting loyal, vulnerable customers with artificially high premiums.</p>
      <p>"We're the party that will make sure that my Insurance Contracts Bill, that increases protection for policyholders, becomes law".</p>
