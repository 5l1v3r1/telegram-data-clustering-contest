        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/daniel-osbourne/">Daniel Osbourne</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rob-mallard/">Rob Mallard</a>) has been put through the wringer in Coronation Street over the last couple of months after wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sinead-tinker/">Sinead Tinker</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-mcglynn/">Katie McGlynn</a>) died as a result of her cancer diagnosis. The young man left the cobbles shortly after her death, but he returns in time for her funeral — however, there’s more heartache ahead for him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After Beth’s (Lisa George) hurtful words, Daniel took it upon himself to get out of dodge with Bertie, and thus he left the cobbles several weeks back. However, he makes a return in the coming episodes, as he comes back for Sinead’s funeral.</p>
      <p>The service is an incredibly emotional one and, afterwards, everyone gathers in the Rovers.</p>

      <p>While there, Daniel informs Peter (Chris Gascoyne) that he’s going to head back to the flat so that he can watch the videos Sinead made for him and Bertie — which are on his laptop.</p>

      <p>However, unbeknown to him, a burglar is currently at his flat, and makes off with said laptop.</p>

      <p>Later, Daniel arrives home and is devastated to discover that his place has been burgled. While a lot has been taken, it’s the loss of the laptop that leaves Daniel upset, as he’s lost the chance to see Sinead’s final videos.</p>
      <p>Will the police be able to recover his missing belongs?</p>
      <p>What’s more, will Daniel get the opportunity to see Sinead one last time via these clips?</p>
