      <p>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson have pulled out of England’s squad ahead of Sunday’s fixture against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>‘Jordan Henderson will miss England’s final UEFA EURO 2020 qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday,’ a statement from the FA read.</p>
      <p>‘Henderson arrived in camp with a viral infection that has not fully cleared.</p>
      <p>‘Meanwhile, his Liverpool team-mate Gomez sustained a knock in training on Friday and has not recovered sufficiently enough to travel.</p>
      <p>‘The pair now returned to their club meaning the Three Lions will head to Pristina on Saturday with a 23-man squad.’</p>
