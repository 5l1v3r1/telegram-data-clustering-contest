      <h1>Clinton would "not be at all surprised" at Donald Trump impeachment</h1>

        <b>Hilary Clinton has said she believes US President Donald Trump will be impeached.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Trump is accused of abusing power by withholding aid for Ukraine, unless the country investigated his political rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>The former US Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate said the testimony presented so far in the inquiry is "devastating" against Mr Trump.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the country's <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/trump-impeachment-inquiry-chair-witness-intimidation-taken-seriously-925657">former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch</a></b> said she thought corrupt Ukrainians helped her downfall.</p>
      <p>Ms Yovanovitch said: "What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a US ambassador.</p>
      <p>"How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?</p>

      <p>"Which country's interests are served when the very corrupt behaviour we have been criticising is allowed to prevail?</p>
      <p>"Such conduct undermines the US, exposes our friends, and widens the playing field for autocrats like [Russian] President Putin.</p>
      <p>"Our leadership depends on the power of our example and the consistency of our purpose. Both have now been opened to question."</p>
      <p>Mr Trump also attacked Ms Yovanovitch on Twitter as she testified.</p>
      <p>"I can't speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating", she said.</p>
      <p>The head of the US House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, told her: "Well, I want to let you know ambassador that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously".</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the inquiry also heard from William Taylor - the top US diplomat in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Mrs Clinton, whose husband Bill was impeached during his presidency, said there are similarities with past impeachment cases.</p>
      <blockquote>"I think that the testimony that was already presented is devastating.</blockquote>
      <p>"These are not partisan people at all, they are public servants - two very experienced diplomats who were just reciting the facts as they knew them: what they had seen, what they had heard and why it mattered".</p>
      <p>Mrs Clinton was also a lawyer on the impeachment staff who investigated Richard Nixon in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>"I think that the Democrats in Congress who are running this process have been very careful [and] vigilant about not getting ahead of themselves, following the facts where they lead, and I will not be at all surprised if the House decides to impeach Donald Trump".</p>
      <p>"I know from the experience with Richard Nixon - the abuse of power, the obstruction of justice, the contempt of Congress that were the allegations against him - we've already seen evidence of.</p>
      <blockquote>"It's pretty simple: our constitution talks about not only high crimes and misdemeanour, but also bribery.</blockquote>
      <p>"And bribery doesn't have to just be person to person, it can be nation to nation in the sense that a president would abuse his office to try to coerce the president of another country in desperate need of military assistance to protect his country against Russian aggression: that he would not get that assistance unless he manufactured information that could be used against the president's political opponents.</p>
      <p>"That is exactly the kind of abuse that the people who wrote our constitution were most worried about".</p>
