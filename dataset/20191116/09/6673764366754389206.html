      <p><b>FUKUOKA – </b>Yokozuna Hakuho maintained his sole lead by beating rank-and-filer Takarafuji on Saturday, the seventh day of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament.</p>
      <p>The Mongolian-born yokozuna defeated No. 3 maegashira Takarafuji (3-4) to improve to 6-1 in the day’s final bout at Fukuoka Kokusai Center.</p>
      <p>Takarafuji fought aggressively from the initial clash — when Hakuho lunged for a left-handed belt hold but came up empty. But despite his good fortune, Takarafuji was easily denied a belt hold of own. When he shifted his weight to try and gain one, Hakuho quickly slapped him down and pumped his fist in celebration.</p>
      <p>Hakuho, who holds the record for career grand tournament championships, is aiming to win his 43rd makuuchi title at a 15-day tournament that has been plagued by injuries to high-ranking wrestlers. Yokozuna Kakuryu and ozeki Goeido are among those on the casualty list, which also includes three rank-and-file wrestlers.</p>
      <p>Five wrestlers, including komusubi Asanoyama and No. 8 Sadanoumi, remain one win behind Hakuho at the final tournament of the year.</p>
      <p>Ozeki Takakeisho and Takayasu fought persistently and bounced back from their defeats on Friday.</p>
      <p>In the day’s penultimate bout, Takakeisho (4-3) beat No. 2 Myogiryu (3-4) as the fan favorite continues his comeback after winning re-promotion to the sport’s second-highest rank.</p>
      <p>Takayasu (3-4) resisted shoves to his face from No. 4 Tamawashi (4-3), but was under pressure with his heels against the straw bales. The ozeki, however, unleashed a powerful push that caught Tamawashi flat-footed and sent the maegashira falling over backwards.</p>
      <p>Takayasu, who earned promotion to the sport’s second-highest rank in 2017, is currently fighting as a demotion-threatened <i>kadoban</i> ozeki, needing at least eight wins to maintain his rank at the January meet in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Sekiwake Mitakeumi (3-4) snapped his losing streak at three after dominating his bout against No. 4 Kotoyuki (3-4). While Mitakeumi started on the backfoot against the 181-kg maegashira, he bounced back and pushed him toward the edge before sending him off the ring.</p>
      <p>While Mitakeumi came into the tournament eyeing his second-straight makuuchi-division championship and promotion to ozeki, those hopes were dashed after he suffered four losses in the first six days.</p>
      <p>Hokutofuji (4-3) lost to No. 1 Daieisho (4-3) and was the only komusubi who failed to win on Day 7.</p>
      <p>Popular komusubi Endo (3-4) posted the quickest win of the day, pushing down No. 5 Ryuden (3-4) right after the initial clash to finish the bout in 0.7 seconds.</p>
      <p>Abi (4-3) defeated Bulgarian No. 5 Aoiyama (4-3), while Asanoyama bulldozed No. 1 Okinoumi (2-5) from the raised ring.</p>
      <p>Among the wrestlers who started the day at 4-2, No. 8 Sadanoumi defeated No. 6 Enho (4-3) to pick up his fifth win. The Sakaigawa stable wrestler held Enho’s belt with his right hand and threw his 98-kg opponent.</p>
      <p>Sadanoumi is three wins away from achieving his third straight winning record, having posted an 8-7 record in September and a 9-6 mark in July.</p>
