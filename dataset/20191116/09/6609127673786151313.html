        <b>RANGERS are considering what action to take after being left with 'concerns' over claims that a '£50million blunder' by HMRC led to the Ibrox club's financial implosion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Times <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4952016/taxman-50m-blunder-rangers/">reported on Thursday that Oldco Gers' final tax bill could be massively reduced</a> and that the taxman had acknowledged it had claimed too much over the use of EBTs.</p>

      <p>HMRC have hit back at those claims with chief executive <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4958979/rangers-tax-hmrc-letter-times/">Jim Harra writing a letter to Times Scotland editor Magnus Llewellin</a> to warn him about "inaccurate and partial reporting".</p>
      <p>Former Ibrox chairman John McClelland has said the club wouldn't have plunged into liquidation in 2012 if the lower bill reported this week had been the figure claimed before Craig Whyte bought the club for £1.</p>
      <p>But the tax authority <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4956486/rangers-tax-ebt-hmrc/">is adamant it has not made any mistakes</a> in how they calculated Gers' tax liabilities.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> have broken their silence over the affair to admit to "concerns" at suggestions HMRC got their sums wrong.</p>
      <p>An Ibrox spokesperson said: "The Times story, if it is shown to be accurate, throws up a great many questions and is a cause for concern.</p>
      <p>"Rangers will take time to consider any courses of action which may become feasible."</p>
