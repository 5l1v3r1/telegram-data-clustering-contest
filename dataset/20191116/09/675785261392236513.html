      <h1>Gary Neville admits Saudi Crown Prince Man Utd takeover is 'not ideal' in Glazers defence</h1>
      <h2>Gary Neville has questioned if there are any alternatives to the current regime under the Glazers at Old Trafford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:35:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville believes a potential takeover of Manchester United from the Saudi Crown Prince is not the solution.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-braced-third-takeover-20656717">Mirror Sport reported last month</a> that United were braced for a third takeover bid from Mohamed Bin Salman after a £3billion offer was rejected.</p>
      <p>According to a source close to the club, the Red Devils have already rebuffed two offers from the Arab nations' <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Royal family</a> .</p>
      <p>The Glazers have insisted they are not willing to sell at any price despite protests from United supporters against their ownership.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports pundit and United legend Neville has questioned the potential alternatives on offer.</p>

      <p>"I know the Glazer family, met them probably five times in my life, but whatever Gary Neville says they are not going to do anything. Trust me. They're going to sell when they want to sell," <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7690773/Gary-Neville-defends-Glazers-Manchester-United-owners-criticises-whinge.html">he told the Times.</a></p>
      <p>"What is the alternative [to the Glazers]? It is either going to go to a Russian family, Chinese family, Asian family, a Saudi Arabian family. If it gets sold for £3 billion, it is going to be basically people who have £15-20 billion.</p>
      <p>"What are they going to be like? Human rights issues of countries I've just mentioned. There is no ideal here."</p>

      <p>Neville also insisted he will not join the protests against the current regime at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>He added: "'The idea of screaming about the Glazers every ten minutes, saying they are not good owners of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , doesn't get us anywhere.</p>
      <p>"I'd love owners that pump every penny back into the club on to the pitch, that didn't take out £20 million a year, or whatever they take out in debt against the club. But I can't do anything about it.</p>
