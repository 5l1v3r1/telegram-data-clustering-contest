      <p>TORONTO — A highrise apartment building in north Toronto had to be evacuated after it was badly damaged by a five-alarm fire that erupted Friday afternoon and quickly spread to several floors.</p>
      <p>About 100 firefighters and 22 trucks raced to the scene as flames and smoke belched from the building.</p>
      <p>Some terrified tenants went out on their balconies where witnesses say they could be heard screaming for help.</p>
      <p>Toronto Fire Chief Matthew Pegg said several people were rescued, and that at least one was taken to hospital where they were listed in stable condition. </p>
      <p>Transit buses were brought to the scene in North York to shelter many of the tenants.</p>
      <p>Chief Pegg later tweeted that the building's electricity was being disconnected and all the tenants evacuated for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>He said emergency shelter plans were being organized for those needing assistance.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate word on the cause of the fire.</p>
      <p>This report from The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 16, 2019.</p>
