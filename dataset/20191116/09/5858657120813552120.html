      <p>FAIRBANKS, Alaska — Alaska school district officials have suspended a high school skiing head coach after discovering allegations were made against him in a domestic violence protective order petition.</p>
      <p>The Daily News-Miner reported Friday that the ex-girlfriend of West Valley High School coach Nicholas Crawford requested a renewal last week for a one-year protection order she obtained in November 2018 citing continued safety concerns.</p>
      <p>Court documents say the ex-girlfriend accused Crawford of sexual misconduct while she was incapacitated at his home in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Officials say they were employed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks at the time.</p>
      <p>School district officials say Crawford was suspended pending more details from university officials.</p>
      <p>Crawford says his suspension was due to an unresolved Title IX investigation and that he passed a background check with the district.</p>
