      <h2>The contestants have an uncomfortable history involving a scandalous affair claim that rocked Jacqueline's marriage - which her husband Dan Osborne has always denied</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:40:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Things could be awkward in the I’m A Celeb jungle for contestants Jacqueline Jossa and Myles Stephenson as shock past affair claims risk crawling back into the spotlight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">The 27-year-old former EastEnders actress</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/myles-stephenson">the 28-year-old former X Factor contestant</a> are among <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">the stars heading into the Australian jungle</a> as part of the 2019 series.</p>
      <p>However, they have been thrown into the headlines in the past for all the wrong reasons as vicious rumours saw their romantic lives rocked.</p>
      <p>Back in May 2018, photos emerged of Jacqueline’s reality star husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne, 28,</a> looking incredibly close to Myles’s now-ex-girlfriend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen, 27,</a> when the two enjoyed a sun soaked trip on a boat in Marbella.</p>

      <p>Rumours erupted that the two reality stars had enjoyed a passionate affair behind the back of Jacqueline - who had been left behind in the UK while heavily pregnant.</p>
      <p>By September 2018 - just as Myles and Gabby started dating - Dan went public with his side of the story to slam the affair rumours, but admitted he understood why his wife had been left hurt by the photos.</p>
      <p>Rejecting the idea that anything sexual had happened, Dan told the Sun at the time: “The pictures on the boat didn’t look amazing from that angle, I am not going to lie. But we were all laying down on that thing and then Gabby is like sat on the side of it.”</p>

      <p>He added: “The photographer just caught the moment where I leaned up. A picture can be anything, it looked bad. I understood when Jacqueline wasn’t happy about it and there was some speculation."</p>
      <p>While Jacqueline and Dan’s marriage survived that scandal, more trouble emerged in February this year when it was suggested Dan had kissed Love Island star Alexandra Cane on a while night out.</p>
      <p>While Dan rejected the fresh rumours, Gabby waded into the debate in March, telling the Sun that Jac “deserves better” amid the scandal.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>By August 2019, however, Gabby’s own romance with Myles came to a crashing end amid accusations he had sent flirty messages to other women behind her back.</p>
      <p>Gabby confirmed the news, writing on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> : “The newspaper articles are true. I am no longer in a relationship. I hope youse have all had a better week than me!”</p>
      <p>With both Jac and Myles due to be spending the next few weeks huddled around campfires in the Australian jungle, it could make for some awkward conversations for the two should they discuss their romantic lives.</p>

      <p>However, Jac has already stated she is taking part in the show to end speculation that she is a “doormat” following months of rumours about the state of her marriage.</p>
      <p>“I think people think I am a pushover or a doormat. I also think some people pity me,” she said after it was confirmed she would be taking part in the 2019 series.</p>
      <p>"I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best,” she added.</p>
