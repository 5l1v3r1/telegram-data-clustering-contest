      <p>An argument over food led to a fight at Parkville youth justice centre on Saturday, leaving three injured workers in hospital and parts of the centre in lockdown.</p>
      <p>Paramedics were called to the centre on Saturday afternoon after reports that staff members had received punches to the head.</p>

      <p>A Department of Justice and Community Safety spokesperson said three staff members were taken to hospital for assessment.</p>
      <p>"As with all incidents or allegations of violence or assault, the matter has been referred to Victoria Police.</p>

      <p>"Violent behaviour or assaults at youth justice centres are absolutely unacceptable, and the safety of staff, young people and the community is of the utmost importance.</p>
      <p>"New laws are now in effect that strengthen consequences for young people who assault youth justice custodial workers, damage property, and escape or try to escape.</p>
      <p>"This includes a presumption they will serve their sentences on top of an existing period of detention."</p>
      <p>Community and Public Sector Union spokesman Julian Kennelly said parts of the centre had been placed into lockdown after Saturday's assault.</p>
      <p>"It was apparently an argument over food, but detail is scant," he said.</p>
      <p>"There were punches to the head and the ambulance was called and three taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>"Weâ€™ve told management they should lock down units for above 15-year-olds."</p>
      <p>He said the workers were injured during an argument involving two youths, one just 15-years-old, who were both placed in detention for aggravated home invasions.</p>
      <p>A member of the union will visit the centre on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Saturday's attack comes six days after <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p539fi.html">another staff member was taken to hospital with facial fractures</a>. He was assaulted when he tried to break up a fight last Sunday.</p>
      <p>The union has previously reported there were 311 assaults on staff at youth justice centres in the first 120 days of this year, ranging from physical assaults, to spitting, to threats of violence and verbal abuse.</p>
