      <h1>‘Confused’ Harry Kane criticises England fans for booing Joe Gomez</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:03:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>England striker and captain Harry Kane has spoken out on supporters who booed Joe Gomez in the Three Lions’ win over Montenegro, saying he was confused as to why the defender was receiving abuse.</p>
      <p>Kane said he could not understand why Gomez was booed, stating that the whole squad were surprised by the antics, which were completely unfair on the Reds man.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling was the man in the wrong after the well-publicised incident, which left Gomez with a scratch across his face. After his negative reception at Wembley, Gomez is said to be devastated.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50441684">BBC Sport</a>, Kane said: <b>“I don’t think any player should be booed so hopefully, it won’t happen if they play on Sunday.”</b></p>
      <p>England face Kosovo tomorrow with both Gomez and Sterling in contention to start. Sterling, who was left out of the squad by Gareth Southgate for the last game as a punishment, is expected to come straight back into the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>Kane added: <b>“It was a different week to what I have been used to. Joe and Raz had a chat and then after that, I spoke to Joe again to see how he was feeling. We had a private meeting and I won’t discuss what we said. I think we all handled it as well as we could have.”</b></p>
      <p>The main takeaway from the incident is how much the rivalry between Manchester City and the Reds has increased over the last few months.</p>
      <p>With the title race now at boiling point, it is vital that the Reds keep winning matches to keep City at least the nine points behind that they currently are and offer no encouragement.</p>
      <p>They certainly won’t be lacking motivation to drag themselves back up to top spot.</p>
