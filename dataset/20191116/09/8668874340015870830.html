      <p>Worcester started their European Challenge Cup campaign by running in nine tries in a 57-14 rout of Russian club Enisei-STM.</p>
      <p>Fly-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/jamie-shillcock/">Jamie Shillcock</a> grabbed a hat-trick of tries and kicked six conversions as the Premiership club made a flying start to their Pool One campaign in Krasnoyarsk.</p>
      <p>Richard Palframan, Nick David, Shillcock, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/jono-kitto/">Jono Kitto</a> and Joe Morris all scored first-half tries as the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester">Worcester</a> led 31-0 at the break.</p>
      <p>Justin Clegg added another before Shillcock scored two tries in the space of nine minutes to complete his hat-trick, while the try-scoring was completed by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/wellington/players/gareth-simpson/">Gareth Simpson</a> late on.</p>
      <p>Forwards Uldis Saulite and Dmitrii Krotov touched down for the hosts in the second half.</p>

      <p>Edinburgh also started their campaign with a bonus-point win on the road as they beat <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/agen">Agen</a> 31-10 in Pool Three.</p>
      <p>George Taylor’s first-half brace and a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh/players/damien-hoyland/">Damien Hoyland</a> try – all three converted by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh/players/simon-hickey/">Simon Hickey</a> – saw <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> make a fine response to Thomas Vincent’s early penalty for the French side.</p>
      <p>Masilevu scored a try for Agen in the 56th minute but hooker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh/players/cameron-fenton/">Cameron Fenton</a> sealed Edinburgh’s bonus-point score in the last minute.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the opening night of the competition, replacement Anthony Etrillard’s 75th-minute try rounded off a 20-13 win for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulon">Toulon</a> at fellow Top 14 side Bayonne.</p>
      <p>The visitors outscored Bayonne four tries to one in the Pool Two clash but they failed to land any conversions.</p>
      <p>Marcel Van Der Merwe’s first-half brace put them 10-6 up at the interval but Peyo Muscarditz’s converted try gave the hosts the advantage early in the second.</p>
      <p>Julian Savea touched down to give Toulon a two-point lead before Etrillard crossed against his former club.</p>
      <p>In another all-French clash, Brive ran out 27-11 winners at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/stade-francais">Stade Francais</a> in Pool Four.</p>
