        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein) was sentenced to prison earlier this year in Emmerdale after abusing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (Joe Warren-Plant), but the character is released from prison in the coming episodes, and David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) can’t stop worrying she’ll make contact with his son as a result.</b>
      </p>
      <p>David learns the devastating news that Maya is being released, and he later relays this information to Leyla (Roxy Shahidi) — who understandably struggles to process what she’s heard.</p>
      <p>While they’re displeased about the prospect of her release, it’s the fear of her making contact with Jacob that proves their greatest concern.</p>
      <p>After deliberating over what to do for the best, both David and Leyla make the decision to inform Jacob about Maya’s release. After doing so, they wonder if they’ve done the right thing, but Jacob is oddly composed about the whole thing.</p>

      <p>Leanna (Mimi Slinger) does her best to support Jacob — however, Jacob later disappears, and Leyla and David are sick with worry over whether or not the young lad has gone to meet with his abuser.</p>

      <p>Will David and Leya be able to track down Jacob?</p>
      <p>What’s more, with Maya having been released, will she make a return to the village? It’s certainly a possibility, but whether or not she’ll set foot back in the Dales has yet to be revealed.</p>
