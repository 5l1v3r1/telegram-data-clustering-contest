      <p>At least five people died after being shot in clashes between coca farmers and security forces in Bolivia on Friday, local media reported.</p>
      <p>A further 34 people were injured and more than 100 were arrested, according to Nelson Cox, the ombudsman of the city of Cochabamba, newspaper El Deber wrote.</p>
      <p>The farmers were trying to march through Cochabamba to La Paz to support ousted president Evo Morales, who is in exile in Mexico.</p>
      <p>The police and the military blocked the way of the protesters on a bridge in Sacaba, an eastern suburb of Cochabamba.</p>
      <p>Jaime Zurita, the police chief in Cochabamba, said the farmers attacked security forces with guns.</p>
      <p>Morales comes from a family of coca farmers. In the early 1980s he became active in the coca farmers’ union in central Chapare region, before being elected executive secretary of a coca growers’ federation in 1988.</p>
