      <h1>Arsenal have been in decline since Arsene Wenger's exit - and Unai Emery's stats prove it</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery has come under mounting pressure following a string of poor performances and a record of just two wins from their last 10 Premier League games.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>When Unai Emery was unveiled as Arsene Wenger's replacement as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager in May 2018, the Spaniard declared: "I look forward to giving everyone who loves Arsenal some special moments and memories."</p>
      <p>Almost 18 months on from his appointment and the brutal truth is that there have been few special moments for the Gunners faithful to enjoy.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Emery has come under mounting pressure following a string of poor performances and a record of just two wins from their last 10 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>A 2-0 loss at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> last weekend saw Arsenal fall eight points behind the current top four, with Emery's target of a return to the Champions League looking as far away as ever.</p>

      <p>And their miserable form only highlights the struggles they have endured since Arsene Wenger saw his glittering 22-year reign come to an emotional conclusion at the end of the 2017/18 campaign.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old won three Premier League titles — including in 2003-04 when his ‘Invincibles’ went unbeaten for an entire season — and seven FA Cups during his time as Gunners’ boss.</p>
      <p>During the end of Wenger's spell, Arsenal fans began to get restless over their lack of silverware and failure to challenge for the Premier League title.</p>
      <p>But the statistics show that Arsenal had more success in his last 50 Premier League games in charge than they have in Emery's first 50 top-flight matches.</p>
      <p>Under Emery, Arsenal have recorded 87 points in the Premier League but Wenger managed one point more in his last 50 matches.</p>

      <p>Wenger's tally of 27 wins is two more than Emery's current record, while the Spaniard - known for his defensive style of play - has only managed to oversee 10 clean sheets, 10 fewer than his predeccessor.</p>
      <p>And another worrying revelation is the lack of attacking football they appearing to be playing under the beleaguered manager.</p>
      <p>Arsenal averaged 61.4 per cent possession under Wenger, but they has reduced to 57.6 per cent under their current boss, while they attempt far few shots on target too.</p>
      <p>And they also seem to face more shots on target (Emery's Arsenal on 696, while Wenger's Arsenal faced 576( another suggestion that Arsenal are no longer a feared opposition.</p>
      <p>After the defeat at Leicester he called for calm as Arsenal headed into the international break on the back of one win from seven in all competitions.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He was also defiant following a 1-1 Europa League draw at Vitoria last week when he was asked about former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Jose Mourinho being linked to the post, simply replying: "I am the coach."</p>
      <p>Emery, 48, was appointed as Arsene Wenger's successor in May 2018 and his first season ended with a 4-1 Europa League final defeat to Chelsea having missed out on a top-four finish by a single point.</p>
      <p>This season he has had to contend with former captain Laurent Koscielny refusing to go on the club's pre-season tour and eventually pushing through a move to Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>Emery has since made the controversial call to ostracise Mesut Ozil for a length of time and strip Granit Xhaka of the captaincy after he told supporters to "f**k off" last month.</p>

      <p>Xhaka has warned Arsenal supporters that the "extreme hostility" that was directed at him damages team spirit.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old lost the armband after swearing at fans as he was jeered following his substitution in a 2-2 draw against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> - also removing his shirt and cupping his ears.</p>
      <p>Xhaka went on to issue an apology of sorts, explaining that ongoing social media abuse aimed at his family also led to his furious reaction, but Emery decided to remove him as skipper and has yet to select the Switzerland international in any of the four matches since the Palace incident.</p>
      <p>It was no doubt a desperate bid to win over the Arsenal fans - but they are beginning to run out of patience, and rightly so.</p>
