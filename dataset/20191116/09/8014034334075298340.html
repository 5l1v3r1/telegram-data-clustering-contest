      <h1>Sudanese officials: 6 troops killed in Yemeni rebel attack</h1>

      <p>CAIRO — Officials in Sudan are saying an attack by Yemeni rebels has killed six members of a Sudanese paramilitary force that’s been fighting in Yemen.</p>
      <p>The officials said Saturday that the attack earlier this week targeted a position on the Saudi-Yemen border held by Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.</p>
      <p>Sudanese troops have been deployed in Yemen for years as part of the Saudi-led military coalition’s war against the Houthi rebels.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates had said an attack on the Saudi-Yemen border killed one of its soldiers. But it’s unclear if the Sudanese troops were killed in the same attack.</p>
      <p>Both Emirati and Sudanese troops have been pulling out of Yemen in recent months.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to brief the media.</p>
