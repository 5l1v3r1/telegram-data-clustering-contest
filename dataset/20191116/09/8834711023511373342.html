      <p>Zimbabwean-born photographer Barry Salzman began his journey into the world of photography during the historic anti-Apartheid uprisings. His family fled Zimbabwe and came to South Africa on the eve of the Soweto Uprisings of 1976. His interest in photography grew out of the idea of using the camera as a device to explore, grapple with and make sense of complex societal issues. Documenting areas of genocide led him to Rwanda, a country that marked the 25th Anniversary since the end of the Rwandan genocide.  </p>

      <p>Frightened fish, shy bears, sarcastic owls and birds that were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. These are the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards finalists – but we imagine there wasn’t much to laugh about for the subject of the winning image, above. It was taken by Sarah Skinner in Botswana, and shows a lion club “playing”… The young lioness “continues to thrive in the pride”, according to Sarah, who also wanted to “encourage everyone, as a collective” to do their best to help conserve wildlife “so that future generations can enjoy them in the same way I have during my career”.<br/><br/>SOURCE: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49690173">BBC</a></p>

      <p>Reading “Women Travelers on the Nile,” a 2016 anthology edited by Deborah Manley, one will find kindred spirits in the women who chronicled their expeditions to Egypt in the 19th century. The book is collections of letters and memoirs written by intrepid female journalists, intellectuals and novelists, all British or European. Relentlessly entertaining, the women’s stories reflected the Egyptomania that flourished after Napoleon invaded North Africa in 1798. The country had become a focal point for artists, architects and newly minted photographers — and a fresh challenge for affluent adventurers.<br/><br/>SOURCE: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/travel/Egypt-Nile-cruise-women.html">THE NEW YORK TIMES</a></p>
