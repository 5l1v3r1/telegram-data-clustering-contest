      <h1>How the word 'queer' has emerged as a term of empowerment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:05:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/abc-local/ben-nielsen/9009840" target="_blank">Ben Nielsen</a></address>
      <p>Growing up, Sam Day was often called "queer".</p>
      <h3>Key points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For some, the word queer has become a term of empowerment</li>
        <li>The term once meant 'unusual' and 'dubious'</li>
        <li>Queer now describes a range of sexual orientations and gender identities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>His identity as a gay man made him an easy target for schoolyard bullies in 1970s Adelaide.</p>
      <p>He said the word was a put down.</p>
      <p>"The sense of the feeling is about isolation and that you don't fit in," he said.</p>
      <blockquote>"It was also the weight, not only of someone saying it to you, but the culture at the time about what it meant."</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Day said he managed to escape the taunts when he started working part-time in hospitality during high school.</p>
      <p>"I met all the other 'odd bods' and I found my people and we all just did it together and no-one called each other names," he said.</p>
      <p>In recent years, 'queer' has re-emerged — in the vocabularies of LGBT people — as a descriptor and term of empowerment.</p>
      <blockquote>"It's not something I would be comfortable in using to describe myself … and I don't know a lot of people in my age group who do," Mr Day said.</blockquote>
      <p>"[Young people] don't have the experience … on what has happened before.</p>
      <p>"It still grates me because it says that this person is not normal."</p>
      <h3>Reclaiming a slur</h3>
      <p>Linguist Lee Murray said the term queer once meant "unusual" but started to change around the 1500s to mean "dubious" or "not that great".</p>
      <p>Sometime afterwards, it started being used as an insult levelled at LGBT people.</p>
      <p>"If any word can pick up a negative meaning or a derogatory meaning, it will … eventually drive out all the positive ones," Ms Murray said.</p>
      <p>"It happens constantly in language change, but particularly with words that minoritise groups.</p>
      <p>"It was a word that had all this power that was used by mainstream society.</p>
      <blockquote>"You can see a parallel with the way that racial slurs are treated."</blockquote>
      <p>Some sources indicate people began reappropriating queer after the Stonewall riots in 1969.</p>

      <p>Ms Murray said a more neutral or positive definition did not start cementing itself until the 1990s.</p>
      <p>One of the earliest representations cited by the Oxford English Dictionary is a newspaper report about a woman at a march in 1987 holding a placard, "We're Here Because We're Queer".</p>
      <p>Advocacy groups, like Queer Nation in New York City and Queer Action in Victoria, started adopting the term from the 1990s to represent "diversity of sexuality and diversity of our political focus".</p>
      <p>"It's a descriptive word, and it's even a positive identity word but it's also an umbrella term that perhaps the community didn't have before," Ms Murray said.</p>
      <p>"To describe yourself as queer is enough to say, I'm not heterosexual and or I'm not this gender and beyond that, you don't actually have to specify anything about it."</p>
      <h3>Identifying as 'queer'</h3>
      <p>Luke Forester said he recently started identifying as queer, because "gay" never felt right.</p>
      <p>"The word 'gay' is tied into a specific culture and community, and I found myself in a place that doesn't represent who I am," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'd already spent quite a big portion of my life being othered and [using gay] felt the same as being in the closet, just a different closet."</p>
      <p>Mr Forester spent his childhood in a "predominantly white" Adelaide suburb.</p>
      <p>He moved to Melbourne, aged 18, and started exploring different avenues of his sexual identity.</p>
      <blockquote>"Queer seemed like a much more fluid term that matched the way we view sexuality, which isn't a rigid thing," Mr Forester said.</blockquote>
      <p>"The younger generation is much more tuned into that."</p>

      <p>An Australian Government fact sheet now describes 'queer' as a term used to describe "a range of sexual orientations and gender identities … [that] encapsulates political ideas of resistance to heteronormativity and homonormativity".</p>
      <p>Despite its renewed usage, Mr Forester acknowledges 'queer' still poses problems to some community members.</p>
      <p>"Some people may have the view … that 'queer' is going to basically be a get out of jail free card for you if you don't actually know someone's specific sexual identity," Mr Forester said.</p>
      <p>"Ask respectful questions, never assume.</p>
      <p>"We should also be respectful about what language we use and know that what we say may mean something different to everyone."</p>
