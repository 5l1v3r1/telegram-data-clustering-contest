      <p>The only disappointment for Tommy Berry with Tilia Rose came when he returned after winning Max Lees Classic at Newcastle on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Is she a Magic Millions horse?" he asked.</p>
      <p>Belinda Bateman's bloodstock manager, James Harron, gave a response in the negative: "She's a homebred."</p>

      <p>"Damn it," Berry said. "I'm looking for one like her for the Gold Coast."</p>
      <p>Tilia Rose (pictured) is the only daughter of Prevail, which started favourite for a Gimcrack Stakes and ran fourth, and has pass on her speed.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately the mare died and this her only one to race. She looks all right. That was a nice debut," Harron said.</p>
      <p>Tilia Rose ($3.30 fav) was the complete professional, jumping quickly and sitting outside the speed in the 900m scamper before Berry took her through a couple of gears to win by a length from Redoute's Image ($3.50), with another 1¾ lengths back to Zeftabrook ($5.50).</p>
      <p>"She did what you want. She jumped and relaxed until one came up three-wide," Berry said. "She got a bit keen then, but I held her together for as long as possible and there was plenty left."</p>
      <p>Tilia Rose was $101 to $26 in the Golden Slipper after breaking Jonker's race record and may have another run before a break.</p>
      <p>"She has the right attitude," co-trainer Paul Snowden said. "She will learn a lot from that and she will be better over a bit further."</p>
      <p>Redoute's Image lacked the winner's race smarts, jumping well before going back for the first 200m of the race and then sitting out three wide. She could match the winner's dash when the pressure came on in the straight.</p>
      <h3>House rules</h3>
      <p>House Of Cartier is heading to next month’s Villiers Stakes after returning to the winning circle and showing a real dash to open the Newcastle stand-alone meeting.</p>
      <p>In a slowly run 1850m, Brenton Avdulla let House Of Cartier find her feet midfield before breaking</p>

      <p>33 seconds for the final 600m, and the jockey feels she could be better at a mile.</p>
      <p>The Oaks placegetter had a bit of class on her rivals and scored by three-quarters of a length from Sir Pippin and Master Shuhood.</p>
      <p>‘‘I took a lot out of her trial the other day. I thought she trialled really well and if she was anywhere near her best today she would be very hard to beat,’’ Avdulla said. “She is going to be even better in a race with a bit more pressure over a shorter trip.”</p>
      <p>Trainer John Sargent prefers to keep House Of Cartier fresh and may go straight to the Villiers at Randwick on December 14.</p>
      <h3>Poster girl</h3>
      <p>John Ramsey continued his good run landing a plan with Pinup Miss at Newcastle.</p>
      <p>The four-year-old is owned by the Ramsey family, and when Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott declared she was not up to standard, she was sent to Scone.</p>
      <p>“I marked this race down at the beginning of the preparation as the target and gave her two runs and she has peaked on the right day,” Ramsey said. “It has been a good couple of weeks and that has topped the week off.’’</p>
      <p>Ramsey had Never Listen run second in the VRC Oaks last week and Pinup Miss was his sixth winner in the past month.</p>

      <p>Burning Crown delivered a long promised metropolitan Saturday win and did it all the way to close the Newcastle meeting.</p>
      <p>Trainer Sue Grills had to depend on three scratchings to the get the flying sprinter into the race but once the gates opened he took control showing he is maturing.</p>
      <p>‘‘That was fantastic, he finally got to lead on his own. Jason [Collett] has got beautiful hands and rode him perfectly,’’ Grills said. ‘‘He is four now, he still wants to overrace but he is a lot stronger.</p>
      <p>‘‘He is a big strong horse now and we’ll see the best of him. he has won two in a row.</p>
      <p>‘‘I know he only won at Coonabarabran last start but he broke the track record, and dropping four kilos today I was quietly confident.’’</p>
      <p>Burning Crown went within 0.09 of making it back-to-back track records as he ran home in 33.71 to hold off favourite Leviathan and He’s A Hotshot.</p>
