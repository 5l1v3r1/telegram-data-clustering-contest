      <p>An Indian Navy MiG-29K trainer aircraft crashed near a village in Goa soon after it took off for a training mission from INS Hansa on Saturday. The incident took place in Dabolim. Both the pilots have managed to eject safely. The aircraft involved in the crash was a trainer version of the fighter jet.</p>

      <p>PTI reported that the aircraft was on a regular training sortie when the incident occurred. A villager informed the news agency that the aircraft crashed on a rocky plateau on the outskirts of Verna, 15 kms from the state capital, around noon.</p>

      <p>“At about noon, a MIG-29K twin seater aircraft, on a routine training sortie, encountered a flock of birds after take off from the INS Hansa airbase at Dabolim in Goa. The pilot observed that the left engine had flamed out and the right engine had caught fire. Attempts to recover the aircraft were unsuccessful due to damage and low height. The pilot, showing the presence of mind, pointed the aircraft away from populated areas and both pilots ejected safely. An enquiry has been instituted by the Navy. Both the pilots are safe. There has been no loss of life or damage to property on ground,” a defence release was quoted as saying by PTI.</p>
