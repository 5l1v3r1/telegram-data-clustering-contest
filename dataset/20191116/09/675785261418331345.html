      <h2>Morgan Symcox's friends have transformed a bench at Wolstanton Marsh into a shrine to the teenager whose cause of death remains a mystery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:27:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Ault</a></address>
      <p>The parents of an 18-year-old who suddenly died have said how moved they are by the actions of his friends.</p>
      <p>Relatives of Morgan Symcox have been "overwhelmed" by the support they have received from the teenager’s friends since he ‘fell asleep’ earlier this month.</p>
      <p>They have transformed a bench into a stunning shrine in his memory, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/this-means-much-us-devastated-3542727">reports Stoke-on-Trent Live</a> .</p>
      <p>It has been covered with dozens of bouquets of flowers, balloons, photographs and messages to Morgan who used to attend Alpha School, in Hanley.</p>
      <p>His friends have also been keeping a vigil at the site.</p>
      <p>Now the friends want to raise money for a plaque and a second bench – which Morgan always said he wanted so friends could sit opposite each other and chat.</p>

      <p>Dad Damon Symcox, 42, said: "We go to the bench because that’s where he was happiest. He loved his mates.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I’d say, ‘can’t you stay in tonight’. I didn’t understand why he always wanted to go to the bench, but I understand it now.</p>
      <p>"You realise that his mates care about him as much as we do.</p>
      <p>"I have been to the bench every day, it feels closer to him.</p>

      <p>"Whenever you go there’s always someone there, it’s amazing.</p>
      <p>"When you read that someone has passed away in the paper, everyone says that they were the heart and soul, but Morgan really was.</p>
      <p>"If you met Morgan for five minutes, then six-months later you would still remember him.</p>
      <p>"You don’t realise how popular someone is until you lose them."</p>
      <p>Mum Liz, 42, said: "Morgan was a very popular lad,</p>
      <p>"We are living in hell, but his friends lost him too and they have made that lovely bench.</p>
      <p>"It has been their meeting point since they were about 13.</p>
      <p>"They must have put about 40 or 50 bouquets of flowers, and 60 or 70 photographs.</p>
      <p>"Morgan loved going out and socialising, everything was about his friends.</p>

      <p>"His friends have done a memory box which they are going to bury. They want to pay for a plaque on the bench.</p>
      <p>"When we go to the bench and see his friends and cry and give them a hug they hug you back.</p>
      <p>"They will never know how much it means to us."</p>
      <p>Morgan was found pronounced dead in the bedroom of the family's May Bank home on Saturday, November 2.</p>
      <p>The exact cause of his death is still not known.</p>
      <p>Liz added: "He just fell asleep.</p>
      <p>"Morgan was about to start an apprenticeship as a plumber.</p>
      <p>"We are a really close family. Earlier this year we went on holiday for five days in Poland, then we went to Turkey for two weeks."</p>

      <p>Morgan had two sisters - Keely, 23, and three-year-old Annie - who he doted on.</p>
      <p>Keely said: "He loved documentaries and history. He knew everything worth knowing. He loved tanning and sun beds, he loved his food and designer clothes.</p>
      <p>"He loved life, that’s why it’s so cruel and sad.</p>
      <p>"He was my best friend. He was lovable and funny, he would  make anyone laugh, and he was very loyal.</p>
      <p>"All his friends say they are living in Morgan’s world. Everything they do now, they say it’s for Morgan’s world. That’s their way of coping.</p>

      <p>"When we go to the bench and see his friends there’s no awkwardness, it’s like we are all together."</p>
      <p>Morgan’s girlfriend, Lily Mason, 17, of Chesterton, said: "He would have done anything for those close to him.</p>
      <p>"He faced every single day with a smile on his face. He was so intelligent and funny.</p>
      <p>"I will never meet a more generous and lovely person. He was so loved by everyone around him.</p>

      <p>"He was one in a million."</p>
      <p>Friend Dionne Dale, 18, of May Bank, said: “Anyone who knew Morg will know that he was the most positive, funny, wildest person to ever walk this Earth.</p>
      <p>"He never let anything faze him and always found a bright side to every situation."</p>
