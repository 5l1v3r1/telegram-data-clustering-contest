      <p>Agents of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Natasha Akpotiâ€™s polling unit are coercing people to vote for the party.</p>
      <p>Ms Akpoti is the Social Democratic Party (SDP) governorship candidate.</p>
      <p>This happened at about 9:13 am in Ogbeiba 1 Ward, Adanos house 2, 012, Okehi Local Government of the state.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES learnt that the agents of the ruling APC followed voters to the cubicle to coerce them to thumbprint for APC.</p>
      <p>The agents also prevented journalists from taking pictures or videos.</p>
      <p>A scuffle later erupted with the SDP party agent collapsing as a result of being hit on his head.</p>
