      <h1>The Azerbaijan v Wales team news and starting XI you can expect to see</h1>
      <h2>The predicted Wales lineup for the Euro 2020 qualifier in Baku</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T09:58:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>Wales are set to have Aaron Ramsey available for selection for the first time in a year for their crunch Euro 2020 qualifier with Azerbaijan tonight.</p>
      <p>The attacker has not featured for his country since the 1-0 friendly defeat to Albania in November 2018 but is included in Ryan Giggs' squad for the double header with Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>Since missing the last international break in October, Ramsey has featured three times for Serie A giants Juventus, scoring on his most recent appearance for Maurizio Sarri's side in a 2-1 Champions League group stage triumph over Lokomotiv Moscow.</p>
      <p>And while Giggs remained coy on whether or not the Red Wall could expect both Ramsey and talisman <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gareth-bale-real-madrid-wales-17262408">Gareth Bale</a> to start against Azerbaijan in Baku, the boss admitted he was delighted they were both in camp attempting to prove their fitness.</p>

      <p>"You'll have to wait and see. I've not had Aaron Ramsey in the squad so it's good to have him back," said the Wales manager.</p>
      <p>"Like Gareth, the shortage of game time is something I'm going to have to look at but it's good to have Aaron back.</p>
      <p>"Gareth hasn't played, which is not ideal, but he's trained well at Real Madrid last week and we've tried to get some volume of training this week.</p>
      <p>"He looks good and feels good. I think he'll be ready."</p>
      <p>Bale has not played for Real Madrid since Zinedine Zidane's men beat Granada 4-2 prior to the last international break in October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gareth-bale-real-madrid-wales-17262408">He responded to criticism from the Spanish media</a> during the pre-match press conference for Wales' qualifier against Azerbaijan at the Bakcell Arena.</p>

      <p>But Bale will hope to extend his lead at the top of his country's all-time men's scoring chart and help fire Wales to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Giggs will be without Neil Taylor and Danny Ward who both pulled out of the squad due to personal reasons while Tom Lawrence withdrew due to illness.</p>
      <p>Joe Rodon, Jonny Williams, Ben Woodburn and David Brooks all missed out on the squad due to injury.</p>
      <p>Kick-off in Baku is at 5pm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Predicted lineup</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wales: Hennessey; Roberts, Mepham, Lockyer, B Davies; Ampadu, Morrell; Bale, Ramsey, James; Moore.</p>
