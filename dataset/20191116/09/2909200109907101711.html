        <b>Controversial musician now a political Activist Kwaku Asare Obeng popularly known as APlus has said Akufo-Addo is not himself as what he is doing in government is different from what he promised he would do when he was campaigning, describing the president as “China-spec”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a post sighted by MyNewsGh.com, Aplus said the current Akufo-Addo is “China-spec”.</p>
      <p>The founder of The People’s Project (TPP) said so far as he is concerned, he doesn’t know the man currently serving Ghanaians as President.</p>
      <p>“He is not my original Nana from 207 [sic]. This one na pure imitation. China spec!!!” He wrote.</p>
      <p>” s for the one that is president of Ghana today, sorry I don’t know him.” He added.</p>
      <p>APlus took the president to task for building a National Cathedral when school children don’t have classrooms and furniture.</p>
      <p>“This is the country where the president’s top most priority is to build a cathedral so that when he dies he will go to heaven and his supporters are quick to insult anyone who complains. I know my Nana Addo. I love my Nana. As for the one that is president of Ghana today, sorry I don’t know him. He is not my original Nana from 207. This one na pure imitation. China spec!!”</p>
      <p>This is not the first time the founder TPP has leveled some wild accusations on the NPP and Akufo-Addo.</p>
      <p>Menzgold cash for NPP 2016</p>
      <p>According to A Plus, the NPP in opposition took money from almost everyone including Nam1. “The Menzgold money is with NPP big men” he claims.</p>
      <p>He further claims, the NPP government took money for your Koforidua conference and promised to help him (NAM1). A Plus went has accused the government of using monies of customers from menzgold to fund their 2016 campaign.</p>
      <p>The poor menzgold customers money was used to sponsor the NPP 2016 campaign.”</p>
      <p>Further more the controversial Political activist has also revealed that Unibank collapsed because of the NPP. He explained that the ruling party took money from the bank for their campaign. He claims the NPP extravagantly spent a whopping amount of 2 million dollars for their Tamale Congress in the year 2014. The NPP cape coast conference was also funded by the Unibank even when the bank was at the verge of collapsing he added.</p>
      <p>“Even when you won and knew that the bank was on life support you still went for poor depositors money for your Cape coast conference because you knew that even if the bank collapses you will pay with taxpayers money. The biggest scam in this country is the NPP”, he stated emphatically.</p>
