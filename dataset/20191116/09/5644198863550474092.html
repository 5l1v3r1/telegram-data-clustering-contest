      <p>HONG KONG: Pro-China protesters plan to rally in Hong Kong on Saturday (Nov 16) to denounce increasingly <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/highway-blockade-reveals-splits-in-hong-kong-protest-movement-12099138">violent anti-government unrest</a> in the Chinese-ruled city and support the police who have become a prime target of attack.</p>
      <p>The former British colony has been embroiled in more than five months of demonstrations, with pro-democracy protesters angry at perceived Communist Party meddling in a city guaranteed its freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>

      <p>Protesters are also furious at perceived police brutality, a charge police deny.</p>
      <p>Pro-China protesters have gathered before, but in far smaller numbers than those angry at Communist Party rulers in Beijing.</p>
      <p>Anti-China students and activists have barricaded at least five campuses in the last week, stockpiling petrol bombs, catapults,<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-protests-weapons-arrows-petrol-bombs-police-violence-12094078"> bows and arrows and other weapons</a>.</p>
      <p>Police have kept their distance for more than two days, but many observers are afraid of what happens if and when they move in.</p>
      <p>A 70-year-old street cleaner died on Thursday after being hit on the head by one of several bricks police said had been thrown by "masked rioters". On Monday, police blamed a "rioter" for dousing a man in petrol and setting him on fire. The victim is in critical condition.</p>
      <p>On the same day, police shot a protester in the abdomen. He was in stable condition.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule under a "one country, two systems" formula guaranteeing its colonial-era freedoms. Protesters' demands include full democracy and an independent investigation into perceived police brutality.</p>
      <p>China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble. Police say they are acting with restraint in the face of potentially deadly attacks.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong universities, in a joint statement, said they regretted the fact that "the government response had so far not been effective".</p>
      <p>"However, any demand that universities can simply fix the problem is disconnected from reality: these complicated and challenging situations ... are reflections of Hong Kong-wide disagreement, and the government must take the lead with swift and concrete action."</p>
