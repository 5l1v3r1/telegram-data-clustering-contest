      <h3>Ade Ojeikere</h3>
      <p>If Nigeria must consider herself as a soccer-crazy nation, then Super Eagles must qualify for the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup, to justify our massive population of over 200 million people, with vast potentials to reach for the zenith in any profession. Anything short of a quarter-finals ticket in Qatar would make a mockery of the quality of players available to the country and their exploits with their European clubs.</p>
      <p>Our players have grown in stature in Europe, wresting shirts from other nationals in their clubs. They enjoy weekly rave reviews based on their performances, with many wondering why these boys can’t replicate their clubs’ form playing for Nigeria. Whereas our players have grown in geometric proportions, our administrators and coaches are tottering arithmetically, thus creating a lacuna which ought to have been fixed after the country did well in her maiden World Cup appearance in United States in 1994. Nigeria didn’t make it to the quarter-finals in 1994, but our second round ouster came with a lot of gains, chiefly among them was Nigeria being ranked the fifth best playing nation in the world.</p>
      <p>The rebirth of the USA’94 World Cup Super Eagles side came with radical changes which pitched Clemens Westerhof against his critics, most of whom wanted a predictable team of players based on their pedigree, not their current forms. Westerhof wasn’t going to be stampeded into sticking with unruly players simply because they rescued the country in previous competitions. Westerhof thought about the future. He visited the domestic league centres. Took pride in living with us here, eating our food, learning to cook some of them and seeing games by himself, not relying on newspapers’ reports or jaundiced commentaries in the electronic media.</p>
      <p>Westerhof’s revolutionary changes ensured that Nigerian won the gold medal in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games, with the bulk of the players he discovered doing the country proud. Many may not know that it was Westerhof who spotted Nwankwo Kanu in the domestic league and recommended him to Golden Eaglets’ Coach Fanny Amun. Kanu was part of the players used to reinforce the World Cup winning Golden Eaglets in 1993. In fact, the last set of players used before picking the USA’s 94 squad were members of the side that picked the Olympic Games gold in Atlanta, including Taribo West. Many have credited the feat to Johannes Bonfrere. But Westerhof did the spade work, not forgetting that Bonfrere was part of the instruments the Dutch used to reinvigorate the Eagles to winning ways.</p>
      <p>Westerhof’s side played with zeal and passion. They lasted the 90 minutes and walked tall out of the field to rousing applause because the fans knew they gave their best. Rebuilding the Eagles under Westerhof had its twists and turns, but it was apparent that the squad  would shock the world like they did in the US. Westerhof read the riot act to players who played for top sides in Europe, leaving the task of filling the existing vacancies in the team to home-grown players. This policy gingered the good ones in the league to give their best. Need I name them to save space?</p>
      <p>I’ve sat through Super Eagles’ matches under Gernot Rohr dispirited. I would only applaud his ability to spot talents in Europe. Rohr did well in a few games in terms of his tactics. However, he doesn’t look like the coach to qualify Nigeria for the quarter-finals in Qatar, irrespective of what he said about his penchant for making late changes in Eagles’ matches.</p>
      <p>This writer can’t understand what Rohr meant with his claim that he used goalkeeper’s experience with African nations in picking Daniel Akpeyi ahead of Maduka Okoye, who distinguished himself against the Samba Boyz, a game Nigeria were held to a 1-1 draw by the Brazilians. Akpeyi was very poor at the Africa Cup of Nations, bringing him back is a big minus on Rohr’s path and it shows that the coach doesn’t want to develop the game at the domestic level. Rohr should tell us what African experience became a determining factor to pick goalkeeper to man the goalpost against a soccer minnow nation such as Benin Republic? Or is Rohr saying that African football would affect a goalkeeper, Okoye who plies his trade in Germany? If so, why did Rohr not pick an entirely home-based squad for the Benin game? How would Okoye gain the so-called Africa experience when he is kept on the bench? This is the way we watch in awe and allow European coaches destroy our game under the guise of giving them a free-hand to pick their players. What Rohr’s laughable Africa experience portends is that Akpeyi has been given a lifeline to return to the Eagles, making Okoye and Ezenwa benchwarmers for a goalkeeper who shouldn’t be in the squad following the law of averages playing for Nigeria.</p>
      <p>In reviewing Rohr’s contract, the coach should be told to  pick at least three home-based players. This idea of inviting 23 foreign-based players for a game that won’t require more than 14 men to prosecute is the easiest path for coaches to cut deals with agents and European club scouts. Besides, the remaining 10 Europe-based stars who don’t get fielded in particular matches just earn free cash doing nothing. Some of these benchwarmers have clocked over four consecutive games sitting on the bench watching games and celebrating with mates when goals are scored.  This writer would rather have at least two talented home-based players sitting on the bench, which is possible than foreign-based. The experience of training with stars they watch only on television is one experience that will linger for a very long time. Of course, such privileges to home-based players will spur those at home to aspire to sit on the bench, possibly play the game.</p>
      <p>More worrisome is the fact that Rohr may have surrendered the national team to players and if this was not the case, why would the German admit seeking the consent of players before fielding them. Ahmed Musa told reporters after the match against Benin Republic that he advised Rohr to use the same line up that started the Brazil friendly for last Wednesday’s game in Uyo.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Rohr told us that he wouldn’t field Joe Aribo because his trip from Scotland to Nigeria was sapping leading to his late arrival – hours to the game. Yet, Rohr handed the first team shirt to Aribo because he came with his father aside telling Rohr that he could play. What a football coach. It is also important to remind Rohr that his team’s defence is weak.</p>
      <p>Rohr said: “Joe Aribo told me he was not tired, despite the long flights to get here and I have confidence in my players when they tell me they are ready to play.</p>
      <p>“Also his father was here at the stadium and this was only his second time coming into the country, so it was important for him to play. And I think we can all be happy he was able to play because he contributed a lot to this win.”</p>
      <p>All attempts to fill the void with foreign-based stars have gone haywire beginning with Ebuehi, Idowu et al. Perhaps, he needs to watch league games here to pick big, strong and skilful defenders for the Eagles, the way Westerhof selected Uche Okechukwu, Benedict Iroha, Isaac Semitoje alongside midfielders, such as Edema Fuludu. These home-based players were part of the Eagles’ squad that lifted the Africa Cup of Nations trophy in Tunisia.</p>
      <p>When players start to suggest to coaches what they want, how the team should play and who should start matches, the coach has lost the dressing room as he will be courting chaos if he rejects others’ wishes. There can’t be competitiveness for shirts if a few people can influence how the team sets up for games. Gradually, such players constitute themselves into a mafia which would ruin the team’s structure and unity in the camp.</p>
      <p>Should Rohr go at the end of his contract? Rohr told everyone in Uyo in a post-match conference on Wednesday that: “I have to work, the contract is not a problem. I think by the end of the year, I’ll discuss it with the FA. No distraction for me, but it’s time to have a new project to win the next AFCON.</p>
      <p>“I start now with the AFCON qualifiers and don’t know if I will finish it but it’s not really a problem but our project must be made for at least three years because what we want to do is to also go to the next World Cup and also have a good philosophy too,” Rohr added.</p>
      <p>But will Nigeria retain Rohr’s services after June 30, 2020? Read my lips.</p>
