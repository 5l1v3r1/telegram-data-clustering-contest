      <p>AMD Ryzen processors have some <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-8-core-cpu-130-usd-deal/">incredible deals</a> going on for the holiday season but an even more impressive deal has popped up, this time for the Ryzen Threadripper 1900X. The CPU can now be bought for a fraction of its introductory price and if you're planning to build a high-end desktop PC on a budget then this might be your perfect choice.</p>
      <h3>Wants More PCIe Lanes? Here's an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1900X With 64 For Just $150 US</h3>
      <p>The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1900X launched back in 2017 as the first HEDT series from the red team. While there have been many 8 core processor launches since the 1900X, the processor may still be worth it for enthusiasts who want more PCIe lanes, NVMe RAID and quad-channel memory support with up to 2 TB (ECC) capacities.</p>

      <p>Back when the Ryzen Threadripper 1900X launched, it was available for $549 US. Now the same chip can be bought for $149.99 US at <a href="http://bit.ly/32MEXp6">Newegg </a>and <a href="https://amzn.to/2FpPJuv">$155.00 US at Amazon</a>. Again, there are plenty of reasons for buying this chip even in 2019. Starting with the specifications, the processor rocks 8 cores and 16 threads. it has a base clock of 3.8 GHz and a boost clock of 4.0 GHz. The chip carries 20 MB of cache and a TDP of 180W. It supports quad-channel (ECC / Non-ECC) memory with a total capacity of up to 2 Terabytes. Now it may not be the fastest 8 core chip any more and the Ryzen 7 2700X deal we <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-8-core-cpu-130-usd-deal/">reported</a> yesterday is superb for budget gamers, the processor is great for storage enthusiasts.</p>

      <p>The processor rocks 64 PCIe lanes and while those are Gen 3 based versus Gen 4 on the new TRX40 motherboards, that's still a whole lot of PCIe expansion available to users. Along with the added benefit of NVMe RAID, those building high-end storage PCs or a secondary streaming setup can get the Threadripper 1900X at $150 US for an absolutely stellar HEDT setup. But as good as a deal it may sound, the X399 motherboard prices are pretty hefty at the moment with the cheapest TR4 socketed ASRock X399M Taichi going for around <a href="https://amzn.to/2A9jYB3">$309.99 US at Amazon</a>.</p>
      <p>The X399 motherboards have seen a price hike recently since they are no longer in production anymore due to the arrival of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-trx40-motherboard-round-asus-asrock-aorus-msi/">TRX40 series</a> which are expected to be priced insane. Again, if you've been eyeing a HEDT chip and need the extra PCIe lanes, then this is the best deal you can get right now!</p>
