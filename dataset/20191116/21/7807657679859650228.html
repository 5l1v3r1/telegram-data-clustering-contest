      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a first-person shooter from Activision.</li>
        <li>Datamined files suggest that new maps and modes are coming to the game.</li>
        <li>A 200-person battle royale mode was also discovered among the files.</li>
        <li>You can purchase Call of Duty: Modern Warfare for $60 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SG77NQB/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;linkId=0510e7c769ab4a94ae60984245248841&amp;tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU71850YYw">Amazon</a>.</li>

The original single-player story and the multiplayer experience was a masterclass in how to make a first-person shooter and now Activision is hoping it can make lightning strike twice. In an effort to expand the game's appeal, the publisher may be looking to add a battle royale mode.</p>
      <p>Ever since PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/fortnite">Fortnite</a> became incredibly popular, almost everyone has tried their hands at the genre. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 even featured a battle royale mode which, in my opinion, is still the best experience on the market due to its stability and realism.</p>
      <p>Recently, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare files were datamined and the results posted on the internet. There was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/dxc194/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_datamine_reveals_200/">Reddit</a> post that broke down all of the features. While we got information about some new maps and perks, the highlight was allegedly the 200-player battle royale offering. The player count seems awfully high so take it with a grain of salt. However, the leak also says that you can play it on your own, as teams of two, or as squads of four.</p>
      <p>Let's hope this is real because I definitely want to play a battle royale game in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's engine. Hopefully, it'll gain a lot of traction if it's real and once it launches. Do you want a battle royale mode to be added to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Let us know.</p>
