      <h1>'Celebrations showed what it means to beat Notts County' the verdict on defeat to Barrow</h1>
      <h2>Magpies suffered first home defeat since August as Bluebirds seal 3-0 win</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:48:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:48</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>The celebrations which followed their victory suggested Barrow had achieved a pivotal result in terms of their own ambitions this season even though it is only November.</p>
      <p>There were high-fives, plenty of cuddles, even a couple of piggy-backs and all that was missing was the explosion of congratulatory fireworks crackling and popping above <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a>.</p>
      <p>This is what it means for teams to beat <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts County</a> this season, the biggest scalp in the division and a team regarded by other managers in recent weeks as the best in the league.</p>
      <p>And such is the level of respect that <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Neal Ardley’s</a> team are commanding these days, Barrow’s manager Ian Evatt revealed afterwards that two weeks worth of work had gone into plotting their downfall.</p>
      <p>As it turned out the attention he paid to the small details paid handsome dividends as they achieved their finest result of the season which took them to the top of the National League.</p>
      <p>Nobody could deny the visitors were good value for their win as they inflicted Notts’ first defeat at home since August, but it would be a lie to suggest they were not given plenty of assistance by their hosts.</p>
      <p>Having made plans to stop the influence of captain Michael Doyle, Evatt must have felt he had won the lottery having encountered a Notts side that fell well below the standards they have set this season.</p>
      <p>Ardley paid tribute to the visitors for their performance in his post-match analysis, but, in truth, it felt like a game in which Barrow did not particularly have to work hard to seal their victory.</p>
      <p>Too many unforced errors, too many wayward passes and, allied with a lack of intensity, meant this was a bitterly frustrating afternoon for the supporters, many of whom had left before the full-time whistle.</p>
      <p>But having lost just three of their last 19 games coming into this fixture, this performance suggests it was an exception rather than the norm, it was just unfortunate it happened against one of their promotion rivals.</p>
      <p>It is hard to be too critical of Notts in that respect given there has been so much to admire about their work this season and all eyes will be on their response when they travel to Aldershot next week.</p>
      <p>Predictably there were a few jeers at the final whistle, but it seemed harsh given just six points separate them from the summit, a gap that is certainly retrievable particularly with the festive period on the horizon.</p>
      <p>But it would be of immense help if Notts could shed a grown habit of conceding early goals given this was the third game in a row they have conceded in the opening 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>In fact, Barrow did not just score once, but twice, inside a quarter of an hour, and while Notts have shown amazing powers of recovery this season, this was one step too far for a team that has often shown it is adept at overcoming setbacks.</p>
      <p>The first goal was excellent constructed by the visitors as Patrick Brough played a beautiful pass to pick out the run of Josh Kay who had escaped down the left hand side with Notts’ defence in pursuit.</p>
      <p>But rather than swing his cross into the box through the air, he had the presence of mind to pull it back low across the ground where Dior Angus’ cute movement allowed him to slide the ball under Sam Slocombe.</p>
      <p>Before Notts could even regain their senses, after conceding in the 10th minute, they found themselves two down and it was a goal that epitomised some of their carelessness in possession.</p>

      <p>Heading back towards his own goal, Enzio Boldewijn attempted a back pass to Sam Slocombe that was undercooked and given Angus’ pace there was only going to be one winner.</p>
      <p>He nicked the ball ahead of Slocombe although the touch was heavy and took him away from goal.</p>
      <p>But once he had composed himself, and in what was almost a carbon copy of the opener, he cut the ball back low towards John Rooney who guided in at the near post.</p>
      <p>Notts attempted to bludgeon their way back into the game and they did have chances.</p>
      <p>Wes Thomas was presented with perhaps their best opportunity when Ben Turner’s header found him at the back post, but he could not turn it over the line.</p>
      <p>As you would expect, Notts began to take more risks in the second half as they attempted to replicate the comeback against Hartlepool a fortnight ago when presented with the same deficit.</p>
      <p>Thomas flashed a shot across the far post with the striker looking the most likely to find a breakthrough given his pace and his movement.</p>
      <p>But eventually as more bodies were thrown forward, Barrow knew there was likely to be a chance to hit Notts on the counter attack.</p>
      <p>The third goal eventually arrived when Jack Hindle converted at the near post to spark wild celebrations from the visitors who clearly felt this was a big result as they chase promotion to the Football League.</p>
