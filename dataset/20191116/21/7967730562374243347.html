      <p>Two federal MPs barred from entering China have been told they will need to "repent and redress their mistakes" if they want to visit the country.</p>
      <p>Liberal MPs Andrew Hastie and Senator James Paterson were due to travel to Beijing in December with Labor MP Matt Keogh as part of a study tour organised by think-tank China Matters.</p>

      <p>On Friday the pair – both China critics – were told their visas had been denied.</p>
      <p>A Chinese Embassy spokesperson on Saturday issued a statement saying the country was open to "constructive dialogue and exchanges with people all around the world".</p>
      <p>But it would "not welcome those who make unwarranted attacks, wantonly exert pressure on China, challenge China's sovereignty, disrespect China's dignity and undermine mutual trust between China and Australia".</p>
      <p>"The colonial days of Western powers are long gone. China will never yield to colonisation of ideas and values," the embassy spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>The statement indicated the MPs would be able to travel to China if they apologised for their remarks.</p>
      <p>"As long as the people concerned genuinely repent and redress their mistakes, view China with objectivity and reason, respect China's system and mode of development chosen by the Chinese people, the door of dialogue and exchanges will always remain open," the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Both Mr Hastie and Senator Paterson, however, have indicated they will continue to speak out about the authoritarian regime.</p>
      <p>Mr Hastie said he believed the decision to block the pair was politically motivated.</p>
      <p>"I think we've been banned from travelling to China largely because we've been outspoken about the Chinese Communist Party, and we've been vocal on human rights issues," the West Australian MP said.</p>
      <p>He said the pair had also spoken for the Uyghur people in Xinjiang province, for Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen in detention in China since January, and about the situation in Hong Kong.</p>
