      <p><b>CAMBRDGE, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Nick Robinson threw two second-half touchdown passes to Rory Starkey Jr. and Penn held Harvard without a first down on its final two possessions to secure a 24-20 Ivy League victory on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In a series that began in 1881, Penn (5-4, 3-3) now has won four of its last five against Harvard. Since taking over in 2015, Penn coach Ray Priore is 4-1 in the series and has beaten Harvard three straight times at Cambridge.</p>
      <p>After surrendering the lead, Harvard (4-5, 2-4) was forced into a three-and-out on its next possession, but the Crimson defense held and Harvard got the ball with 2:21 left at the Penn 40, but Devin Darrington was stopped at the line of scrimmage on 4th-and-1 and Harvard turned the ball over on downs and Penn ran out the clock.</p>
      <p>Robinson ran in from 3-yards out to put Penn on the board with its first possession and Daniel Karrash kicked a 24-yard field goal to make it 10-7 midway through the second quarter, but Jake McIntyre hit from 28- and 42-yards out to put Harvard up, 13-10 at the break.</p>
      <p>Robinson found Starkey with a 70-yard strike early in the third quarter and from 16-yards out for the win. He finished with 203 yards on 12-for-27 passing.</p>
      <p>Jake Smith was 26 of 41 for 322 yards for the Crimson.</p>
