      <p>Naomh Conaill 0-12 - 0-9 Clontibret</p>
      <p>Naomh Conaill will take on either Kilcoo from Down or Fermanagh’s Derrygonnelly in the Ulster Club SFC final following the Donegal champions’ win over Clontibret tonight at Omagh’s Healy Park.</p>
      <p>Six points from Eoghan McGettigan and an all-round superior performance means Naomh Conaill have the chance to keep the Ulster SFC in the north-west after Gaoth Dobhair’s success last year.</p>
      <p>McGettigan posted three points from his advanced position inside of the first 10 minutes and although Conor McManus got the first of his half-dozen in all, it was Naomh Conaill who were 0-6 to 0-1 up on 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>McManus scored two frees to make it 0-6 to 0-3. However, a close-ranger from Eoghan McGettigan just as the clock trickled from black to red did provide a settler and a 0-7 to 0-3 lead at the break.</p>
      <p>Ciaran Thompson scored a peach of a point in his left foot to make it 0-8 to 0-3 in what was the first of his three second half points.</p>
      <p>A spectacular score from Ciaran Thompson edged Naomh Conaill into a five-point lead at the start of the second half, before MacManus and scores from Francis Hughes and Dessie Moan kept Clontibret in touch.</p>
      <p>However, Naomh Conaill always had Clontibret at arm’s length and booked their place in the final thanks to late scores from both Eoghan McGettigan and Ciaran Thompson.</p>
      <p><b>Naomh Conaill:</b> Stephen McGrath; Jeaic Mac Ceallabhuí, AJ Gallagher, Kevin McGettigan (0-1); Ethan O’Donnell, Anthony Thompson, Ultan Doherty; Ciaran Thompson (0-3, 2f), Leo McLoone (0-1); Eunan Doherty, Eoin Waide, Marty Boyle; Brendan McDyer (0-1); Charles McGuinness, Eoghan McGettigan (0-6, 3f).</p>
