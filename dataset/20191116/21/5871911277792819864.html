      <p>The Alabama Crimson Tide suffered a tough upset loss against the LSU Tigers last week, and their 2019 campaign just keeps getting worse.</p>
      <p>Alabama was on track to rebound again Mississippi State on Saturday, enjoying a sizable lead, but star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa exited the game with what appears to be a season (and career) ending hip injury.</p>
      <p>It happened in the second quarter, when Tagovailoa was pursued by two Bulldogs defenders, and was tackled hard to the ground by them — landing awkwardly.</p>

      <p>He was carted off the field by trainers.</p>

      <p>Tua was then airlifted to a local hospital.</p>

      <p>And the news is not good.</p>

      <p>That may have, unfortunately, been the end of Tua’s college football career. The next steps would be surgery, and then preparing for the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
