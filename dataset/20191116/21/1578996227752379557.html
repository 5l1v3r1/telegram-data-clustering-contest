      <p>Brace yourself: Beyoncé posted quite possibly one of her greatest outfit of the day shots ever on her Instagram this afternoon. The singer shared close-up details of the shimmering nude sequin gown she wore to the Shawn Carter Foundation Gala last night. Come for the dress, stay for the spot-on accessory: Queen Bey carried a clutch designed to be a stack of $1 billion bills. Beyoncé shared three different Instagram posts showing the outfit from all angles:</p>

      <p>Beyoncé has had a quieter couple months following the release of <i>The Lion King </i>and her press tour for it. But Emilia Clarke made headlines this month when she recounted her experience meeting Beyoncé<i> </i>at Bey's Oscars party this year.</p>
      <p>"I did not expect to see them, you know, in the flesh, I wasn’t expecting that at all,” Clarke said of Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z on the Graham North Show, via <i><a href="https://people.com/tv/emilia-clarke-cried-when-she-met-beyonce/">People</a></i>. “I was just like, ‘Oh my God, I’m invited!'”</p>
      <p>“And Queen Bey came up to me, and obviously, looked at me like, ‘Oh…I’d like to talk to you!’ and I just did not respond in the way that I was thinking she thought that I might respond,” Clarke said. “As in, she obviously came up and was like, this’ll be cool, and I was like, ‘Oh my God,'" Clarke then made a crying noise, saying she was "too many drinks in, [I] started crying, it didn’t go well. I mean, literally, eyes welling up like, ‘I can’t handle this, it’s too intense.'”</p>
