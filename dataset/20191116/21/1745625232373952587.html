      <p>In the next two slides, Beyonce’s 134 million Instagram followers are able to get a close-up view of her accessories for the night. The multi-hyphenated star posted her clutch, which was a rhinestoned, $1 billion bill. Beyonce also showed 0ff her nails for the evening, and showed that she opted to go with black gel nail polish. She also showed off her dazzling diamond ring in the photo.</p>
      <p>Beyonce made sure not to stop there with her accessories. The “Love on Top” singer also wore gold and silver drop earrings as posed to one side. The singer also has multiple ear piercings and had an earring in each one. The singer’s profile also showed her gorgeous makeup look. In the photo, she is wearing brown, matte eyeshadow, brown lipstick, foundation, faux eyelashes and a gold highlighter on her cheekbones.</p>
      <p>Beyonce also ensured that her fans had a full view of the dress.
