      <h1>Families' Disneyland Paris dream holiday hell as police probe alleged £370k fraud</h1>
      <h2>Travel firm Go West With Mickey has been closed after complaints by parents who had snapped up bargain packages - with its website and Facebook page also deleted</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:06:10+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:06</time> by <a rel="author">Geraldine McKelvie, Nick Renaud-Komiya</a></address>
      <p>Police are investigating a holiday firm that allegedly sold £370,000 worth of Disneyland Paris trips to hundreds of families who found their tickets were never booked.</p>
      <p>Company Go West With Mickey has been closed and its website and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page deleted after a flood of parents’ complaints.</p>
      <p>Many had snapped up its bargain packages as Christmas surprises for their Disney-mad children.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police, who say they are probing 419 allegations of fraud, quizzed the firm owner this week in a voluntary interview. The owner was released without arrest or charge but remains under investigation.</p>
      <p>Rumours began to circulate earlier this year among customers that Go West With Mickey was failing to fulfil orders after families reportedly turned up at Disneyland Paris to find their tickets had not been booked.</p>
      <p>In October, the firm – which is not registered at Companies House – issued a statement on its website saying it was “dead” and its bank accounts frozen.</p>
      <p>It said: “There has been mistakes, yes it was a company of five staff who also made mistakes.</p>
      <p>“We have always highly compensated for these mistakes.”</p>

      <p>But customers claim the South London firm stopped replying to WhatsApp messages and blocked their numbers.</p>
      <p>Among them was Natalie Pirie, 27, of Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire. She arrived in France with autistic son Rio, 10, and five-year-old twins Kyanna and Boaz to be told Disney had no record of her booking.</p>
      <p>She scraped together enough to pay for another hotel and generous strangers helped her fund park tickets.</p>
      <p>Natalie said: “The stress this caused me was unreal. I was crying every day.</p>
      <p>“I put things on my credit card so the kids wouldn’t be left disappointed.”</p>
      <p>Gran Gail Debling, 67, of Ramsgate, Kent, lost £600 after booking a family trip. She said: “It’s been a nightmare.”</p>
      <p>In its statement, the firm blamed a disgruntled employee and a Facebook group for its downfall. It said it led to “misinformed” customers posting their full booking details online. “This resulted in a number of real people who had booked and paid for a holiday arriving at Disney to find their booking cancelled,” it said.</p>

      <p>“That then caused panic and promoted further postings that GWWM was a scam, that we had taken the money and cancelled the bookings or never made them at all.</p>
      <p>"The credit card company panicked, refunded the booking fee, declined further payments from clients and banks froze our accounts.</p>
      <p>"Complaints to the web hosts caused them to panic and pull down the website, making it seem like Go West had done so. All the bookings were secure, this was easily confirmable by telephoning Disney.”</p>
      <p>The owner told us this week: “If I was going to scam everyone, why didn’t I just run off on holiday?”</p>
      <p>Disneyland Paris said: “Go West With Mickey is not an official commercial partner. They are an unauthorised reseller.”</p>
      <p>The Association of British Travel Agents added: “The firm is not an ABTA member. Operators selling package holidays are legally required to provide financial protection for customers.”</p>
      <p>The Met confirmed Action Fraud had referred the case to them. A spokeswoman said: “It encompasses 419 allegations of fraud. The estimated loss at this stage is £370,000. Inquiries are ongoing.”</p>
      <h3>Moment of joy turns to heartbreak</h3>
      <p>Children leap with joy after being given a Disneyland Paris trip as a gift last Christmas – only to have their dreams shattered in the alleged £370,000 holiday fraud.</p>
      <p>Ali McEvoy, 30, snapped up the packages from travel firm Go West With Mickey. She recorded her two children’s excitement after unwrapping a 2019 calendar revealing the trip booked for this December.</p>
      <p>She said: “My kids are gutted. Every time my daughter sees the Disney Castle she gets upset.” Ali, of Paignton, Devon, had booked a four-night break for Owen, 10, and Cariad, seven.</p>

      <p>She paid £804 for rooms and park tickets – then saw web rumours about the firm.</p>
      <p>“I contacted Disney who said there was nothing booked. I was gutted,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ali managed to recoup the money via her credit card.</p>
