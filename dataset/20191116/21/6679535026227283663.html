      <p>As many as 50 students of two government schools in Odisha’s Jajpur were taken ill after consuming mid-day meal on Saturday, officials said.</p>
      <p>The first incident occurred at Sibantpur Upper Primary School under Haridaspur panchayat of Dharmasala block, they said.</p>
      <p>The meal was served at about 10 am in the school and about 40 students were vomiting, feeling nauseous and complaining of stomach pain after consuming it, an official said.</p>
      <p>They were immediately rushed to the nearby Dharmasala community health centre (CHC) and treated.</p>
      <p>According to a preliminary enquiry, a dead lizard was found in dalma (pulses cooked with vegetables), served to the students in the mid-day meal, Dharmasala block education officer Prafulla Kumar Behera said.</p>
      <p>In another incident, 10 students of Bamphu Mangarajpur Nodal School were rushed to the same CHC with similar complaints, the official said.</p>
      <p>Rotten eggs were allegedly served to the students in the mid-day meal, he said.</p>
      <p>Behera said all the students were discharged from the heath centre after preliminary treatments.</p>
      <p>Samples of food, served to the students, have been collected and sent to a laboratory for tests, he said, adding that the matter is “under investigation and appropriate action would be taken, if anyone is found guilty”.</p>
