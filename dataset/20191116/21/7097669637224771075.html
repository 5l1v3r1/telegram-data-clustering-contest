      <h1>'Kill, rob, burn and bury the bodies': Man convicted in 3 grisly farm deaths</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:22:09+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/" target="_blank">Adrianna Rodriguez, USA TODAY</a></address>
      <p>A man was convicted Friday for his role in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/07/16/dismay-sorrow-details-four-gruesome-murders-emerge/482650001/">the grisly deaths of three young men </a>who were lured to a remote farm outside a Philadelphia suburb, killed and then buried.</p>
      <p>After deliberating for nearly 18 hours over three days, the jury convicted 22-year-old Sean Kratz of first-degree murder, robbery and other offenses.</p>
      <p>Kratz went to trial after rejecting an offer to plead guilty to third-degree murder, which would have put him in prison for at least 59 years for the crimes.</p>
      <p>Now the jury has to decide to give him a sentence of life in prison or death. That process starts Monday.</p>
      <p>His cousin, 22-year-old Cosmo DiNardo, who was identified as the leader of the plot, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
      <p>Lawyers say Kratz and his cousin admitted killing Dean Finocchiaro, 19, Tom Meo, 21, and Mark Sturgis, 22, after luring them to DiNardo's family’s 90-acre farm for a drug deal in 2017.</p>
      <p>Kratz was convicted of first-degree and second-degree murder for killing Finocchiaro and voluntary manslaughter in connection with the other two victims.</p>
      <p>DiNardo told authorities Finocchiaro agreed to buy a quarter-pound of marijuana for $700. Bucks County prosecutors said Kratz shot him in the head and served as lookout as DiNardo killed Sturgis and Meo.</p>
      <p>The victims’ bodies were burned in a makeshift pig roaster and buried in a 12-foot-deep hole. After the killings, prosecutors said, Kratz and DiNardo went for cheesesteaks.</p>

      <p>DiNardo also admitted killing 19-year-old Jimi Tar Patrick in another drug deal two days earlier. He told authorities Patrick was a drug dealer who agreed to purchase 4 pounds of marijuana for $8,000 but showed up with only $800. DiNardo said he lured Patrick to the farm, shot him and buried him with a backhoe. </p>
      <p>Kratz and DiNardo were “on a mission to kill, rob, burn and bury the bodies,” Assistant District Attorney Kate Kohler told jurors at Kratz's trial.</p>
      <p>There was a possibility DiNardo would testify at his cousin’s trial, but prosecutors said he rejected their subpoena. Kratz did not take the stand in his own defense.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors and the defense are under a gag order in the case and declined comment after the verdict.</p>
