      <p>Margot Robbie revealed how <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/birds-of-prey-film/">Birds of Prey</a> will delve even deeper into Harley Quinn's life and offered a whole slew of adjectives to describe the film's tone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/margot-robbie-bombshell-suicide-squad-2-bird-of-prey-1203404002/">Variety</a> spoke with Robbie about her upcoming film <i>Bombshell</i>, but talk quickly turned to her upcoming pair of DC films, <i>Birds of Prey</i> and <i>Suicide Squad</i>. On the topic of the former, Robbie touched on how the movie will offer more insight into Harley Quinn. "The story in <i>Birds of Prey</i> is told from [Harley's] point of view, so you have an insight into Harley’s world in a way that you didn’t in the first <i>Suicide Squad</i> film, nor that you’ll have in the next <i>Suicide Squad</i> film," Robbie said.</p>

      <p>Though <i>Suicide Squad</i> received mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike, most agreed Robbie's turn as Harley Quinn was exceptional. In the years following the film's release, numerous projects sprang to life revolving around Quinn. While the fates of many are still up in the air, the team-up film <i>Birds of Prey</i> will put the spotlight on the character as she joins forces with various vigilantes against Ewan McGregor's <a href="https://screenrant.com/birds-prey-movie-black-mask-tease-easter-egg-trailer/amp/">Black Mask</a>.</p>
      <p>The first teaser for the film promised a chaotic and action-packed ride, and Robbie had even more words to describe the movie's tone. "It’s a little bonkers," Robbie said. "It reflects her personality. It’s heightened. It’s poppy, it’s fun, it’s violent, it’s crazy. It’s absurd. It’s kooky. It’s hilarious. It’s a little heartbreaking."</p>

      <p>All of those words are fitting descriptors for Harley Quinn as a character, so if the film can capture that energy, DC's hot streak may continue.</p>
      <p>Directed by Cathy Yan from a script by Christina Hodson, <i>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i> stars Margot Robbie, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Ewan McGregor, Steven Williams, Derek Wilson, Dana Lee, Francois Chau, Charlene Amoia, Chris Messina and Matthew Willig. The film is scheduled for release on Feb. 7, 2020.</p>
