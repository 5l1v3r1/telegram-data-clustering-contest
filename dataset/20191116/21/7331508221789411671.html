      <h1>UFC Fight Night Blachowicz vs. Jacare: Live results, recaps and analysis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Wagenheim</a></address>
      <p>The stakes will be high when <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2506250/jan-blachowicz">Jan Blachowicz</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2431314/jacare-souza">Ronaldo "Jacare" Souza</a> step into the Octagon for the main event of Saturday's UFC Fight Night at Ginásio do Ibirapuera in Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz (24-8) is a light heavyweight title contender, No. 7 in the ESPN rankings, coming off July's knockout of former middleweight champion <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2519811/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a>. And now comes another former 185-pounder. Souza (26-7) is moving up to 205 in the wake of April's loss to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3074102/jack-hermansson">Jack Hermansson</a>, his second defeat in three fights.</p>
      <p>But Jacare can become an instant contender with a win, and Blachowicz needs to have his hand raised to avoid falling out of the top 10.</p>
      <p>This main event will be the finale of a long night of Brazil vs. the World. Jacare is one of 15 Brazilians on the card, with at least one in each of the 12 fights. And there are some legendary names among them, most notably <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335514/mauricio-rua">Mauricio "Shogun" Rua</a>, who fights in the co-main event. Shogun, a former UFC light heavyweight champion, has won eight postfight bonuses in his time with the promotion. He already is in the UFC Hall of Fame, for his wild 2011 fight with <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335497/dan-henderson">Dan Henderson</a>.</p>
      <p>Rua's opponent, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3946951/paul-craig">Paul Craig</a>, is a Scotsman who is on the verge of the UFC record book. He has won two fights in the promotion by triangle choke; one more would give him the record. A Craig submission of any kind would be his fifth, tying the light heavyweight record.</p>
      <p>Here's the lineup, results and recaps:</p>

      <h3>Next fight:</h3>
      <p>Light heavyweight: <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335514/mauricio-rua">Mauricio Rua</a> (26-11, -275) vs. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3946951/paul-craig">Paul Craig</a> (12-4, +225)</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Lightweight: <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504169/charles-oliveira">Charles Oliveira</a> (28-8) defeats <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3894823/jared-gordon">Jared Gordon</a> (15-4) by first-reound KO</b>
      </p>
      <p>Recap to come.</p>
      <p><b>From ESPN Stats &amp; Info: </b>It was back-to-back knockouts for Oliveira after not scoring one since Feb. 2010. Oliveira improves to 5-0 in UFC events in Brazil. Oliveira's fifth first-round finish at lightweight is tied for third-most in division history. His six-fight finish streak is now the longest active streak in the UFC, breaking a tie with <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3155424/marlon-vera">Marlon Vera</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Middleweight: <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3091099/andre-muniz">Andre Muniz</a> (19-4) defeats <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4371002/antonio-arroyo">Antonio Arroyo</a> (9-3) by unanimous decision</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arroyo came charging across the Octagon at the start and sent Muniz into immediate retreat. But that was about it for Arroyo as an aggressor, as he spent much of the rest of the three rounds on the defensive against the grappling of Muniz, who took the unanimous decision for his fifth straight victory.</p>
      <p>Arroyo had a five-fight winning streak of his own coming in. And his early flourish looked promising. But from that point on it was the striker defending against grappling and the grappler fending off striking, not a crowd-pleasing combination.</p>
      <p>Muniz had a few moments on the canvas where a finish appeared possible, but Arroyo made it to the final horn. He just didn't show the urgency he needed to turn the fight his way.</p>

        <b>Middleweight: <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4426282/wellington-turman">Wellington Turman</a> (16-3) defeats <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4246212/markus-perez">Markus Perez</a> (11-3) by unanimous decision</b>
      </p>
      <p>Turman got his first UFC victory by showing himself to be the stronger fighter in a slow-paced bout that never seemed to get going until Perez wore down in the third round. All three judges scored it 30-27 for Turman.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Turman got back on track after seeing a four-fight winning streak end in his UFC debut in July. He had to deal with the flashy striking of Perez early. But as the minutes ticked off the clock, with Turman the fresher man, he seized control until a too-little-too-late rally by his opponent.</p>
      <p>"Markus is a crazy guy," Turman said. "We teased each other a lot during the fight, but I had already said I would tease him the same way he teased me. It was a tough fight, but I was better.</p>
      <p>"I am always training, always on the go. Every time the UFC needs me to save a fight, I will be available. I'm very happy. It's my dream to be part of this. I'm very young. I still have a lot to evolve."</p>

      <p>"I came here today to show my full potential," Ramos said. "I am very happy with the win, and my performance could not have been better. I came to have fun and show that I am coming into this division. With humility, focus and dedication, I will reach the top.</p>
      <p>"I'm not a perfectionist, but I always need to look for my best, and when I don't perform at my best, I get sad. As I move up to featherweight, the focus for this fight was to improve my performance. I got it, and this is the division where I will stay."</p>
      <p><b>From ESPN Stats &amp; Info: </b>Ramos wins his second straight with his seventh career submission win. He moves to 5-1 in the UFC with his first at featherweight after starting his UFC career at bantamweight.</p>

      <p>"It was a good fight, a tough one," Trinaldo said. "I didn't expect his ground game. I actually trained more striking during my camp. But I am happy that I can leave with a win and once again here in Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>"I would like to face <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2526299/edson-barboza">Edson Barboza</a> next. He is the best Muay Thai athlete in Brazil. I think it would be a great match."</p>
      <p><b>From ESPN Stats &amp; Info: </b>Trinaldo extends his record of UFC wins in Brazil to 12.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"I plan to get the finish every time I get out there and fight -- that is my goal," Brown said. "It wasn't exactly how I wanted to be, but we are still working. I am getting better. The first round, I got a little slow start. I slipped at the beginning and did not want to use too much energy trying to get up. Second round, I just went back to what I am good at and won the fight.</p>
      <p>"I would like to fight <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2960681/michael-chiesa">Michael Chiesa</a> next. He moved up to the welterweight division, and I would like to be his next opponent."</p>
      <p><b>From ESPN Stats &amp; Info: </b>It was the fourth career submission win for Brown, second in the UFC. He has now won two consecutive fights. Brown has 10 finishes in 12 career wins.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>From ESPN Stats &amp; Info: </b>Silva de Andrade moves to 4-3 in the UFC with his sixth career win by decision. Barao loses his fifth consecutive fight. Since losing the bantamweight title to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2611719/tj-dillashaw">TJ Dillashaw</a> in 2014, Barao is 2-7. Barao's losing streak is tied for second longest among former UFC champions, behind <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335629/bj-penn">BJ Penn</a>'s seven.</p>
      <p>"I had promised it would be an action-packed fight, and I think I fulfilled that," Silva said. "I put on a show to the fans. I thank UFC for believing in my work, and it was a great honor to fight Renan Barao, an athlete that I always admired, always made sure to watch his fights. He is a former champion, has a legacy and deserves all the credits."</p>

      </p>
      <p>"They booed me, but no one knows what's going on behind the scenes," Lipski said. "I made weight, I did my part. I trained for four months; my opponent changed four times during my camp. I accepted this fight [against a different opponent] with one-day notice. I could have not accepted, but I agreed because I prepared so much for that day. I did my best. I know I won every round, but I also know that I can't please everyone.</p>
      <p>"That was not even a submission [that she had on me]. I train jiu-jitsu and participate in jiu-jitsu tournaments. That was an inverted triangle, and I was just trying to get out. She was not locking me in; there is no submission in that position.</p>
      <p>"I'm so thrilled that I got the win at home; it's a dream I've had since I started in the UFC. Last year was not my best moment as an athlete, but today I knew I would come out with the win anyway."</p>
      <p><b>From ESPN Stats &amp; Info: </b>Lipski snaps a two-fight losing streak, earning her first UFC win and fourth win by decision. De Padua's five-fight win streak is snapped in her UFC debut. She took the fight on just 24 hours' notice.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"It was a hectic week, but I have the right coaches to keep my mind at ease and nothing affected me," Cortez said. "I just stayed focused on the fight. About the fans, I knew the crowd was not going to like me at first, but Brazil is amazing. The fact that they can just cheer someone on like they did is mind-blowing. I pray that when I fight in my hometown they cheer for me like that."</p>
