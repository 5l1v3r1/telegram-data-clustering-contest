      <p>Check out this video from Max Tech that tests the thermal performance of the <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/73250/apple-officially-unveils-new-16inch-macbook-pro">new 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>.<br/><br/><i>In this video, we ran Cinebench R20 5 times in a row to test the thermal performance of the 16" MacBook Pro using Intel Power Gadget to look at temps, clock speeds and wattage! We then compared those results to the 2019 15" MacBook Pro with the same exact 2.6GHz 6-core i7 processor. We also looked at the maximum fan speed of the new MacBook Pro, and we tested the fan noise as well. We then tested Geekbench 5 for processor and Metal graphics performance, as well as Unigine Heaven benchmark to see the difference in gaming performance!</i><br/><br/>The five run Cinebench R20 average was 2577 for the new 6-core 16-inch MacBook Pro compared to 2400 for the 6-core 15-inch MacBook Pro. That's an increase of about 7.4%.<br/><br/>Geekbench's Metal scores reveal significant performance improvements with the base 16-inch MacBook Pro scoring 21328 compared to 12954 for the 15-inch.<br/><br/>Take a look at the video below for more details.
