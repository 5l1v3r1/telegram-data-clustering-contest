      <p>D’Tigress took a bold step to picking a ticket to the Olympics Qualifying Tournament in 2020 after beating host Mozambique 57-48 points to go top of Group A.</p>
      <p>The reigning African champions dominated the first half 21-8, 17-11 to win 38-19 points and will face Mali in the semifinals of the FIBA Africa pre-Olympics qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Mozambique took the second half winning the third and fourth quarters by slim margins, 16-8, 13-11, but it was a case of too little too late as Nigeria stood their ground for a win.</p>
      <p>The top performer for Nigeria was captain, Adaora Elonu who had 12 points, one assist and nine rebounds.</p>
      <p>Ezinne Kalu and Evelyn Akhator scored 12 points each as Akhator also emerged the highest rebounder for the team with a total of 12.</p>
      <p>Head Coach, Otis Hughley, said the game against Mozambique gave the team the opportunity to play together as a team since their Afrobasket win.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are focused on the bigger picture of picking the olympics ticket which is the ultimate target for us as a team.”</p>
      <p>Hughley promised that the game against Mali in the semifinal will be different as they hope to take the pre-qualifiers one game at a time with the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo the ultimate target.</p>
