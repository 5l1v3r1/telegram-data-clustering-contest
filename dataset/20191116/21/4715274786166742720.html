      <p>Since its launch in 2014, FWD Philippines has been providing simple, relevant, and affordable ways for customers to get the protection they deserve. Shop@FWD is the company’s latest digital innovation that reimagines the meaning of insurance. <b>The things you ‘can do’</b> Exclusively available via Shop@FWD is KanDüü, an insurance product suite that covers policyholders so that they “can do” whatever they want with no hesitation. KanDüü is available for individuals aged 18-50 years old and comes in three variants: KanMend, KanLive, and KanGuard. For only P1,799 a year, customers will be covered up to age 55. Each product has distinct features that fit people’s diverse lifestyles and varying needs. KanMend is a life insurance policy that provides a critical illness benefit of P100,000 in case the insured is diagnosed with any of the 42 covered critical illnesses. The policy also comes with a reward—six months of access to KonsultaMD, a health hotline service that provides 24/7 unlimited telemedicine access to licensed Filipino doctors providing medical advice, anytime, anywhere.  KanLive is a life insurance policy that provides a death benefit of P200,000, to beneficiaries in case of the insured’s death. One year of unlimited medical consultation is also included, courtesy of Aventus Medical Inc, a healthcare service provider with 12 branches spanning throughout Metro Manila, Cebu, Laguna, and Pampanga. In the unlikely event that the customer is caught in an accident or terrorist attack anywhere in the world, KanGuard provides a cash benefit of P500,000 for the financial support of the beneficiaries in case of the insured’s death, or for the financial support of the insured in case of total and permanent disability. It comes with a one-year subscription to Assist America Global Emergency Services, a provider of emergency medical services for travelers worldwide. “FWD Philippines offers the most affordable insurance plans with rewards in the country. We want to make insurance more tangible and relatable for our customers through Shop@FWD’s protection products and rewards,” said FWD Philippines Head of Marketing Roche Vandenberghe. “Shop@FWD aims to empower more Filipinos to live worry-free, knowing that we’ve got their back!” <b>Coverage in minutes, Hassle-free purchase, Easy access to Policy information</b> Customers can get covered in minutes, simply by filling out a one-page application form at shop.fwd.com.ph. The application requires no medical exams or paperwork, and customers can manage their insurance coverage anytime, anywhere with FWD Tapp—a one-tap insurance app that allows customers to manage their insurance from the ease of their mobile device. “We value people’s time, and that’s why no paperwork is required when buying through Shop@FWD. Instant coverage is possible just by filling out a one-page form. We strongly believe that insurance should be a convenience, not a burden. That is our true vision for Shop@FWD,” added Grimes. </p>
