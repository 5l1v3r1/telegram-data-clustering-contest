        <b>CRIMINAL record checks staff are snowed under with a backlog in the run-up to Christmas — due to the high number of wannabe Santas and elves.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Firms are having to wait for weeks to start non-seasonal staff because Disclosure Scotland is so swamped with perv checks on people wanting to work with kids.</p>

      <p>Employees at the Glasgow-based vetting agency are currently taking longer than two weeks to clear hundreds of applicants for jobs.</p>
      <p>A source whose business has been hit by the delay said: “We’ve been waiting for ages to get back checks on people that are waiting to start work with our company.</p>
      <p>“Disclosure Scotland is normally able to turn these things around really efficiently so we phoned them to find out what the issue was.</p>
      <p>“We were stunned when we were told it was due to the massive number of people who have applied to be Santa and his helpers this year.”</p>
      <p>A Father Christmas can earn £8-£14 an hour working long days in malls and stores.</p>
      <p>Disclosure Scotland last night said it is processing 94.3 per cent of basic background applications within 14 days.</p>
      <p>Chiefs say the average processing time is 6.4 days.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: “This time of year is traditionally busy due to the number of seasonal workers being taken on.</p>
      <p>"We are unable to provide figures for those seeking to play the role of Santa as there is no requirement for a job title on basic applications.”</p>
      <p>We told in October how authorities were accused of risking kids’ safety by placing no obligation on footie coaches to pass vetting checks before taking one-to-one sessions.</p>
