      <h1>Michigan Player Taunts ‘Little Brother’ Michigan State After Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:30:32+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, No. 15 Michigan hosted Michigan State in a rivalry game that has produced some of the most-memorable moments in recent college football history.</p>
      <p>The Spartans are in the midst of a down season. Mark Dantonio’s squad lost four-straight including an abysmal performance against Illinois last weekend heading into today’s contest.</p>
      <p>Make it five straight.</p>
      <p>Michigan State found the back of the endzone first, but from then on it was all Wolverines. Jim Harbaugh’s program dominated over the final three quarters en route to a 44-10 win.</p>
      <p>After the game, Michigan defensive lineman Michael Dwumfour called out the team’s little brother.</p>
      <p>“Our little brothers didn’t learn they lesson last year had to remind them again,” he said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Before the game started, former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer called out Michigan State’s coaches over the team’s recent struggles.</p>
      <p>“You watch Michigan State play, how many NFL players do they got? That doesn’t look like the defenses I used to go against. They had first-round corners, Le’Veon Bell. I don’t see that. That’s coaches, recruiting development,” Meyer said.</p>
      <p>With the loss, Michigan State falls to 4-6 on the season. The Spartans have Maryland and Rutgers left on the schedule, so a bowl is possible.</p>
