      <p>Rapper <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/swings">Swings</a> and model <b>Lim Bo Ra</b> have announced that they will be starting a coffee shop. <br/><br/>The couple started dating in 2017 and has now opened a cafe together in Seoul. On November 15, Lim Bo Ra announced on her Instagram that they have opened a cafe, which they have been working together for almost 6 months. <br/><br/>In a caption, she wrote, <i>"Since I was a little child I have been collecting photos of cafes, dreaming of opening my own one day. They are not on-trend as they are pictures from way back but I kept those feelings and now I have finally opened a cafe with my boyfriend. We have drastically different tastes but we worked really hard for almost half a year to come up with the one that satisfies both of us. I appreciate the team that put together this project with me the most. (cafe's name and location) Come by if you have time &lt;3" </i></p>
