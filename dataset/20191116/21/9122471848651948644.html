      <h1>There’s A Live Feed Of The Colin Kaepernick Workout In Atlanta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:53:07+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter revealed the <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/colin-kaepernick-workout-being-moved-location">location of Colin Kaepernick’s workout for NFL scouts changed last minute</a>.</p>
      <p>The NFL set up a workout for Kaepernick to showcase his skills at the Atlanta Falcons training facility. However, just over an hour before the workout was scheduled to begin, Kaepernick’s camp decided to move the location.</p>
      <p>They released a statement revealing the decision for the change. The NFL did not want media to attend and film the workout, so Kaepernick changed the location to allow media and the fans to see the workout for themselves.</p>
      <p>A report suggested he asked for cameras to be present for the workout initially – but his request was denied by the NFL.</p>
      <p>The workout moved to a local Georgia high school, where media could attend.</p>
      <p>In fact, everyone can watch from the comfort of their own home. There’s a live-stream available so anyone not in attendance can watch the workout as well.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>
      <p>The former star quarterback hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, though not for lack of trying.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if every NFL team that intended to attend the NFL-sanctioned workout is now at the high school. Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
