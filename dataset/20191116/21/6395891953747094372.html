      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - On Saturday, volunteers in Boston – home to more than 17,000 veterans – are taking the time to thank them one-by-one. It's an annual effort put on by the mayor's office and state treasury. This year, South Boston was the neighborhood chosen for "Thank A Vet."</p>
      <p>Roughly 100 volunteers gathered at a South Boston school. Hearing from Mayor Marty Walsh about what to keep in mind as they meet veterans through Operation "Thank A Vet."</p>
      <p>"The young people particularly, you're talking to history, it's what you read in the books," said Mayor Walsh.</p>
      <p>Then descending onto the streets of Southie with a simple mission: thank vets and let them know about services offered to them.</p>
      <p>"A lot of veterans aren't aware of the benefits," said Steven Croteau, an Air Force veteran of 24 years. </p>
      <p>Croteau is in his first year volunteering.</p>
      <p>"As a veteran, it's great to see people from the community come together and thank people for their service," he said. "It's a great honor and it makes me feel good."</p>

      <p>As for that simple mission, it wasn't so easy for some volunteer groups. They continue to go door to door; the only problem was a lot of veterans weren't home or weren't able to come to the door.</p>
      <p>However, one veteran they did meet in Southie was Army veteran Edward Lane. They nearly missed him, he was heading the hospital to see his wife, Dede.</p>
      <p>"She has cancer," he said. "She's been weak and tired and stuff lately."</p>
      <p>He got a few "thank yous," before leaving, along with a challenge coin from the mayor. A few small, but meaningful gestures.</p>
      <p>"Well, it makes me feel better than when I did it," Lane said of hearing thank you. "When you're in the service you don't get appreciated. Now they say thanks for doing what you do, thanks for your service.</p>
      <p>"It's a great feeling actually. Before, people said, 'eh.'"</p>
      <p>Volunteers have thanked over 3,000 veterans and delivered care packages since the program began in 2015. Their goal is to eventually get to everyone.</p>
