        <b>Gerard Pique has recommended that Barcelona agree a deal to sign Adama Traore from Wolves and bring the Spaniard back to the Nou Camp.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Traore, who currently plays for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, used to play for the Blaugrana before leaving the Nou Camp for Aston Villa back in the summer of 2015.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has been in decent form for Wolves lately, something that seems to have encouraged Pique into recommending his signature to Barca.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/tapado-pide-pique-lateral-derecho-rompe-premier">Don Balon</a>, Pique has advised Barcelona to bring Traore back to Catalonia, with the club themselves only willing to spend as much as €30M on the winger.</p>
      <p>Barca currently have a wealth of attacking options to choose from, thus we don’t feel signing Traore should be at the top of their to-do list at the moment.</p>
      <p>The club need to focus on bringing in a replacement for Luis Suarez at striker, something Traore won’t be given he’s proven to be most effective out-wide for both Wolves and Villa.</p>

      <p>Traore has often been used as a winger during his career, however lately, Wolves have opted to start him as a right wing-back, a decision that has proven to be a wise move thus far.</p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to see if Barca end up listening to Pique’s advice and making a move for Traore in the future.</p>
      <p>If we’re being honest, the Blaugrana should probably forget about Pique’s recommendation here and focus on improving other areas of their squad in the upcoming transfer windows before it’s too late.</p>
