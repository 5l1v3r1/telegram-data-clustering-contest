      <p>Strictly Come Dancing was in uproar as the show closed after judge Craig Revel Horwood failed to give Karim and Amy a 10.</p>
      <p>The couple Motsi Mabuse said: "I am absolutely speechless. I want to give you more than a 10 because it doesn't justify how well you dance. I will give you my hairpiece!"</p>
      <p>Chief judge Shirley Ballas said: "That was absolutely flawless. You are a star" while Bruno said he was like a young Gene Kelly.</p>
      <p>CBBC presenter Karim Zeroual made a few errors last week with professional partner Amy Dowden but this week there were none. The boos began before Craig showed his 9 paddle and continued through the close of the show.</p>
      <p>Presenter Claudia Winkleman said: "I think Craig has to be quite careful in the bar."</p>
      <p>Viewer Emily Davis tweeted: "What more could Karim have done???? Come on Craig that's a joke."</p>

      <p>Rebekah J added: "What the hell is Craig watching? Kelvin and Karim deserved four tens from the judges. They were both amazing!"</p>
      <p>And Fiona Gunn tweeted: "Why not give any constructive criticism and only praise Karim if not a 10 @CraigRevHorwood First time ever Iâ€™ve been disappointed with your choice of scoring."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Geordie Chris Ramsey, who was favourite to leave the show this weekend, wowed the judges and audience with a slinky salsa and was awarded high marks.</p>
