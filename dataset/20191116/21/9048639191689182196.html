      <p><b>MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - </b>A team of scientists at the Morgridge Institute for Research at UW-Madison is working to develop a smart toilet.</p>

      <p>“Some people think we’re crazy,” said Coon Lab staff scientist Ian Miller. “But I think we’re onto something.”</p>
      <p>Josh Coon, the Thomas &amp; Margaret Pyle Chair at the Morgridge Institute and a UW-Madison professor, said his team became interested in the toilet as a way to collect health samples.</p>
      <p>“Because you make daily deposits of valuable health information, the idea is that when you urinate, if we could look at what’s in there, we could tell a lot about how you’re doing health-wise,” said Coon.</p>
      <p>The toilet would pump out a urine sample away for analysis, and the scientists are calling the concept a toilet revolution.</p>
      <p>“It’s an opportunity to revolutionize toilets once again by allowing it to not just dispose of waste, but to give you access to your health information,” said Ben Anderson, a UW-Madison Chemistry graduate student.</p>
      <p>Some of the available information is alcohol consumption, caloric intake, and how quickly a person metabolizes certain medicine.</p>
      <p>“This way you could monitor that throughout the course of your life, daily,” said Coon. “We think that could really change health care and preventative medicine.”</p>
      <p>Similar to a smart watch, the information would be readily available via an enabled phone or device and people wouldn’t have to change their routine or habits.</p>
      <p>“The reason the watch is so powerful is because you don’t have to do anything different,” said Miller. “People wore watches before, but all of a sudden we have access to this data.”</p>
      <p>Coon, Miller, and Anderson are about three months out from developing a prototype. They hope to expand their sample size to a larger audience to analyze more data.</p>
