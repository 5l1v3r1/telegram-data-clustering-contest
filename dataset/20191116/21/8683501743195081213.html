      <p>Martin Scorsese has directed some of the most beloved, memorable films in Hollywood history. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483567/the-irishmans-al-pacino-and-ray-romano-talk-why-the-theater-experience-is-so-important">Al Pacino</a> has starred in his own fair share of cinematic gems. But amazingly, before Netflix greenlit <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483160/the-irishman-reviews-are-up-see-what-critics-are-saying"><i>The Irishman</i></a>, the two icons never got a chance to work together. And now Martin Scorsese is opening up about what it was like to finally snag the 'unreachable' star.</p>
      <p>At a recent AFI FEST event, Martin Scorsese sat down for a quick Q&amp;A session, where he discussed the many obstacles he and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477774/the-10-best-robert-de-niro-movies-ranked">Robert De Niro</a> faced in trying to get <i>The Irishman</i> made. And <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/martin-scorsese-afi-tribute-1202190096/">he also opened up</a> about his decades-long quest to cast Al Pacino in, well, anything:</p>
      <blockquote>I’d been wanting to work with Al for years. Francis Coppola introduced me to him in 1970. Then he’s in <i>Godfather</i> 1 and 2, and he’s in the stratosphere. For me, Al was always something unreachable. We even tried to make a film in the 1980s but couldn’t get the financing for it. I said, ‘What’s he like to work with?’ Bob [De Niro] said, ‘Oh, he’s great. You’ll see.'</blockquote>
      <p>When Al Pacino signed on for <i>The Irishman</i>, Martin Scorsese finally got the chance to see what Robert De Niro meant. But he also had the opportunity to bring the two actors together on screen. It’s a rare cinematic feat -- this is only the fourth time both have appeared in the same film. The actors both starred in <i>The Godfather Part 2</i>. But Robert De Niro plays a younger version of Vito Corleone, the father of Al Pacino’s Michael, so they never share a scene. It wasn’t until 1995’s <i>Heat</i> that the two actors finally had a chance to play opposite each other. Though they teamed up again in 2008’s <i>Righteous Kill</i>, there’s something extra special about the two actors joining forces with one of their most esteemed peers.</p>
      <p>According to Martin Scorsese, seeing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483268/the-irishmans-martin-scorsese-compares-robert-de-niro-and-al-pacinos-very-different-approaches-to-filming">Robert De Niro and Al Pacino</a> in <i>The Irishman</i> creates a kind of meta experience for the viewer:</p>
      <blockquote>What you see in the film is their relationship as actors, as friends, over the past 40, 45 years. There’s something magical that happens there.</blockquote>
      <p>He may be talking about the actors’ shared history, <i>The Irishman</i> does follows its characters, including Al Pacino’s Jimmy Hoffa, through several decades with the aid of some much-talked about <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483242/how-robert-de-niro-felt-watching-his-de-aged-self-in-the-irishman">anti-aging CGI</a>. And whether or not you agree with Martin Scorsese’s decision to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482303/martin-scorsese-reveals-why-he-took-the-irishman-to-netflix-streaming">release the film via Netflix</a>, you can’t deny that <i>The Irishman</i> feels like a huge cinematic moment for the director. If nothing else, it gave him the chance to <i>finally</i> cross one of his most-sought after moments off his bucket list.</p>
      <p><i>The Irishman</i> will be available to stream on Netflix on November 27.</p>
