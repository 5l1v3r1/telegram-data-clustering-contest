      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa’s injury ‘very serious’ in major Alabama blow</h1>

      <p>STARKVILLE, Miss. — Tua Tagovailoa is dealing with a “very serious” hip injury suffered during Saturday’s win, <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195809471248977920?s=20">according to ESPN</a>, that could put the Alabama star quarterback’s season in jeopardy.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was carted off the field in the first half after being dragged down by two Mississippi State defenders, a tackle that left him favoring his right leg and hip.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, who had surgery on a sprained right ankle nearly a month ago, was replaced by Mac Jones, who finished off the 38-7 win. The potential top NFL draft pick was airlifted to a local hospital, where he will be undergoing various tests to determine the severity of the injury.</p>
      <p>“That was going to be his last series,” Alabama coach Nick Saban told ESPN at the end of the first half. “We were going to put Mac in and we said, ‘Let’s put Tua in before the half for two-minute [drill] just for practice.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa had surgery on his ankle after injuring it against Tennessee on Oct. 19. That kept him out of the second half of that game and the entire Arkansas game the next week. Alabama (8-1, 5-1 SEC, No. 4 CFP) had a week off, then Tagovailoa played last week in a loss to LSU.</p>
      <p>The junior scrambled toward the sideline and was grabbed by two Mississippi State players, who landed on top of him. He was helped off the ground by medical staff, avoiding putting weight on his right leg.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was the Heisman Trophy runner-up last year and having another stellar season. He came into the game second in the nation in passer rating at 204.86. With two more touchdown passes against Mississippi State, Tagovailoa has 33 on the season along with 2,840 yards passing.</p>
