      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Arsenal to battle Manchester City for Caglar Soyuncu</h1>

      <h3>Arsenal are reportedly scouting Caglar Soyuncu during the international break but could face competition from Manchester City in pursuit of the Leicester star.</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-sends-scouts-watch-leicester-20881629">The Mirror</a>, Arsenal are interested in Leicester City breakout star Caglar Soyuncu. The Turkish international has become a regular part of the Foxes under Brendan Rodgers and is set to be scouted during the international break by the Gunners as Unai Emery targets defensive reinforcements.</p>
      <p>But, there is an added report from <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11861835/man-city-consider-jonny-evans-and-caglar-soyuncu">Sky Sports</a> that claims Manchester City are also in the race for Soyuncu, with the Citizens looking at both the Turkish international and centre-back partner at Leicester Jonny Evans. Soyuncu though, will be more of a long-term option and have a more approachable profile, with Evans a former Manchester United player.</p>
      <p>Caglar Soyuncu is like a beast let loose this season in the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers. Leicester’s decision to not reinforce after selling Harry Maguire for what was a record fee for a defender to Manchester United received some backlash. But, it has worked out fine, with Soyuncu stepping up and how.</p>

      <p>The Turkish international has forged a great partnership with Jonny Evans and been one of the catalysts as Leicester lie second on the table behind Liverpool. The Foxes have scored freely. But, their defence needs plaudits as well for conceding the least number of goals (8) in the Premier League so far and Soyuncu’s role in it has piqued the interest of Arsenal and Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are devoid of quality options at the back, which has, in turn, made the backline quite error prone. Unai Emery would ideally like to pair Sokratis up with a new centre-back as soon as possible, with summer arrival David Luiz not living up to the potential the move had.</p>
      <p>Manchester City on the other hand, are struggling with injuries at the back. Pep Guardiola admitted after the end of the summer transfer window that he wanted to bring in Harry Maguire and will now be looking to strengthen the central defence the first chance he gets.</p>
      <p>Bringing in an in-form defender from the team that boasts the best defensive record in the Premier League would be the stuff of dreams for Arsenal and Manchester City. But, Rodgers would be eyeing a top four finish at the very least, if not better, which makes the potential of Leicester listening to offers in January near non-existential.</p>
