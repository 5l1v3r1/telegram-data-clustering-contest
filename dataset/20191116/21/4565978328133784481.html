        <b>Ernesto Parra Borroto, leader of the Teatro Tuyo Company, performs these days in Argentina, after successfully participating in the 10th International Festival for Children and Youth, held in the Dominican Republic, and the reopening the Teatro Tuyo Cultural Center, its headquarters.</b>

      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- The one-man play La Estación was the one selected to share on this occasion. According to Alberto Carlos Estrada, a specialist of the Performing Arts and a connoisseur about the work of the troupe, this piece is "the confirmation and the beginning of their own content, staging and technique."</p>
      <p>On the current experience, Parra expressed in his Facebook account: "Thanks to Argentina, thanks to La Plata, thanks <b>Arteniño</b>, thanks to San Simón school, I am sure they will be memorable days." Apart from the performance, conferences, interventions, and other activities are included in his agenda.</p>
      <p>While he gives his best in other lands, the Teatro Tuyo Cultural Center consolidates a systematic programming, after its reopening. Before Parra left for Argentina, the Clarostuyo spectacle was performed there, starring him and Aixa Prowl as actors, and the musical duo Claroscuro - composed by the violinist Clarissa Pérez Hernández and the pianist Carlos Fernández Castro.</p>
      <p>Yuri Rojas, the clown Pedacito also performed there, and the Seres contemporary dance project made its debut, as part of the celebration for the reopening.</p>
      <p>From now on, every weekend there will be shows at 11:00 am. This Saturday and Sunday, for example, the public will enjoy <b>The Clown Party</b>, and the piece <b>Grey</b> will be soon on stage.</p>
      <p>The Teatro Tuyo Company, which emerged under the initial name of Piñata Project, has won the most important awards in the stage arts in Cuba, such as the Villanueva of the Critics, and Adolfo Llauradó and Caricato, of performing. It has also been the promoter of major projects such as the Clown National School, opened last September here in Las Tunas.</p>
