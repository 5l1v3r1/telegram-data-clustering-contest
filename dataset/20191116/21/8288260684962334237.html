      <h1>Prince Andrew's defiant response to 'playboy' claims in explosive BBC Newsnight interview</h1>
      <h2>In his bachelor days, Andrew was given the tabloid nickname of "Randy Andy" and seen by members of the public as a "party prince."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:46:33+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:46</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>The Duke of York has denied that he ever deserved his reputation as a "playboy" prince in an interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>In his bachelor days, Andrew was given the tabloid nickname of "Randy Andy" and seen by members of the public as a "party prince."</p>
      <p>But in a "no holds barred" interview regarding his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein he said: "I think that's also a bit of a stretch. I don't know why I've collected that title because I don't... I never have really partied.</p>
      <p>"I was single for quite a long time in the early 80s, but then after I got married I was very happy and I've never really felt the need to go and party and certainly going to Jeffrey's was not about partying, absolutely not."</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, a convicted sex offender and well-connected financier, was found dead in August while awaiting federal trial for sex trafficking.</p>
      <p>The duke, who joined the Royal Navy in 1979, said he "probably did" trust Epstein and added: "I mean I don't go into a friendship looking for the wrong thing, if you understand what I mean.</p>

      <p>"I'm an engaging person, I want to be able to engage, I want to find out, I want to learn and so you have to remember that I was transitioning out of the Navy at the time and in the transition I wanted to find out more about what was going on because in the Navy it's a pretty isolated business because you're out at sea the whole time and I was going to become the special representative for international trade and investment."</p>
      <p>Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>He dismissed claims he met her in 2001 and they danced, ate and drank with each other and visited Tramp Nightclub before having sex.</p>
      <p>Andrew told the BBC he "didn't drink", that "it didn't happen" and he does not even remember her.</p>
      <p>He said: "No, I've no recollection of ever meeting her, I'm almost, in fact I'm convinced that I was never in Tramps with her.</p>
      <p>"There are a number of things that are wrong with that story, one of which is that I don't know where the bar is in Tramps. I don't drink, I don't think I've ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there."</p>
