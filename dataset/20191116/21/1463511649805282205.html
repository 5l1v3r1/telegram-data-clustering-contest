      <p>In the classification, it was all about the overtime drama between Nigerian Army Rockets and Civil Defenders of Abuja in the second game.</p>
      <p>The game went to two overtime sessions when the fourth quarter ended 79 points apiece before the Nigeria Army side forced the first overtime with the scores tied at 89 points.</p>
