      <p>A San Diego mom and three of her four sons were killed in a shooting early Saturday, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Cops found six people with gunshot wounds inside the family’s home in Paradise Hills, a suburb of San Diego, before 7 a.m. Saturday, <a href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/san-diego-news/5-dead-including-3-kids-in-shooting-at-paradise-hills-home">ABC 10 San Diego reported</a>, citing San Diego Police Lt. Matt Dobbs.</p>
      <p>Two of the boys, ages 9 and 5, were taken to a nearby hospital, where they were pronounced dead. A 3-year-old boy, the 29-year-old mother and a 31-year-old man were found at the scene with fatal gunshot wounds. It’s unclear how the man was affiliated with the family.</p>
      <p>The woman’s 11-year-old son survived the shooting and was undergoing surgery Saturday.</p>
      <p>The mom, who had not been named by authorities as of Saturday afternoon, lived with her kids in an apartment on the property, while their relatives lived in the main residence, neighbors told ABC 10.</p>
      <p>One neighbor who saw police at the home hours earlier on Friday night said the dispute appeared to be a domestic incident.</p>
      <p>Police believe one of the dead adults is the shooter.</p>
