      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:07:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:07</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Nicole Scherzinger was slammed by viewers this evening after "motorboating" Louis Walsh live on The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The judge, 41, became a little wild tonight as she got up close and personal with Louis.</p>
      <p>Moving over to hug him, she pressed her boobs into his face.</p>
      <p>Fellow judge Simon Cowell didn't appear too phased and was busy clapping in the background.</p>
      <p>However viewers were not impressed, insisting that it was supposed to be a "family show".</p>
      <p>They also accused Nicole of inappropriate behaviour and that if she had been a man she would have caused an uproar.</p>

      <p>One fumed on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "Nobody bats an eyelid at Nicole forcibly motorboating a fellow judge. Just imagine the furore if a male judge thrust his schnangus into her face. It would be career ending. #CelebrityXFactor."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Why does Nicole always have to be so sexual. Stuffing her boobs in Louis' face #CelebrityXFactor #XFactorCelebrity."</p>
