      <h2>The former Ireland captain's career in green came to a shuddering end in Japan last month</h2>

      <p>Rory Best officially hung up his boots today in Twickenham - playing his final game of professional rugby with Barbarians.</p>
      <p>The former Ireland captain's career in green came to a shuddering end in Japan last month when Ireland fell to a World Cup quarter final thumping at the hands of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>But Best was able to pull the curtain on a stellar career today in Twickenham - starting for the Baa-Baas managed by England head coach Eddie Jones.</p>
      <p>Best was joined by family and friends after coming off early in the second-half, meeting fans long after the game as he received a heartwarming send-off.</p>
