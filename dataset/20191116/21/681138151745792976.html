        <b>Firefighters tackled a kitchen blaze in Essex this afternoon after smoke alarms alerted residents.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Crews attended the oven fire in Wellesley Road, Clacton, and worked to extinguish it by 2.52pm.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire was accidental after the grill in the oven had burst into flames while cooking.</p>
      <p>The kitchen suffered extensive smoke damage but residents shut the kitchen door when getting out of the house and damage was minimised, according to the fire service.</p>
      <p>Crew manager Andy Anderson, from Clacton Fire Station, said: "We want to highlight the importance of having working smoke alarms, they alert you to the first signs of fire.</p>
      <p>"In the event of a fire, shut doors to minimise smoke damage and contain the fire while you get out of the house and call the fire service.</p>
      <p>"In the build up to Christmas, clean your oven regularly to avoid a build-up of grease and minimise the risk of fire."</p>
