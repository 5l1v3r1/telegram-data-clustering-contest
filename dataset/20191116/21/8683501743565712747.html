      <p>You knew Captain Marvel was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/610829/Why-Captain-Marvel-Writer-Happy-Heroine-Wasn-t-Avengers-Age-Ultron">originally meant to show up</a> in <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, right? That's been talked about for a while, and the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481663/the-mcu-infinity-saga-box-set-looks-awesome-and-costs-everything">new Infinity Saga box set</a> that just came out gave fans a look at how she was supposed to appear.</p>
      <p>But first, some background...</p>
      <p>Several years ago, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484408/marvels-kevin-feige-breaks-silence-about-martin-scorseses-criticism-over-superhero-movies">MCU boss Kevin Feige</a> said Carol Danvers was part of <i>The Avengers</i> sequel's script but they decided to cut her out because they"didn’t want to introduce her fully-formed flying in a costume before you got to know who she was and how she came to be."</p>
      <p>However, <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i> director Joss Whedon originally planned to have Captain Marvel show up akin to Scarlet Witch's big moment. Here's what Kevin Feige <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467787/captain-marvel-almost-originally-appeared-back-in-avengers-age-of-ultron">told Birth.Movies.Death about that</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The way we reveal Scarlet Witch [in costume] at the end of the movie? Those were Captain Marvel plate shots. Joss said, ‘We’ll cast her later!’ And I said, ‘Yeah Joss, we’ll cast her later.’ [Whispers to an invisible associate who isn't Joss] ‘We’re not putting her in there!’ Finally Joss was like ‘Let’s use those plates to let Scarlet Witch fly into frame, give her a big entrance?’ And that makes sense - she’s come to their side, and she deserves the cool intro...</blockquote>
      <p>As Kevin Feige reiterated, introducing Captain Marvel that way is not how the MCU tends to operate:</p>
      <blockquote>It would have done that character a disservice, to meet her fully formed, in a costume and part of the Avengers already when 99% of the audience would go, ‘Who is that?’ It’s just not the way we’ve done it before.</blockquote>
      <p>Instead, the MCU chose to introduce Captain Marvel for the first time <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475400/captain-marvel-directors-have-explained-the-big-skrull-twist">in her own movie</a>, only hinting to her existence at the end of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>.</p>
      <p>But now that the Infinity Saga is here to share all of the MCU's ideas -- <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477908/marvel-may-release-a-giant-infinity-saga-box-set-including-the-really-bad-scenes">good and bad</a> -- from Phases 1-3, we can see one of the early plans for Captain Marvel. Check out what one lucky Infinity Saga holder shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/dx1a7w/captain_marvel_was_originally_going_to_appear_in/">Reddit</a>:</p>

      <p>They hadn't cast anyone for the role yet, so there's a stand-in. Who do you think Joss Whedon would've cast? <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i> started filming in early 2014, so they already had the cast in place by then. Brie Larson earned an Oscar for <i>Room</i> in 2015 so I wonder if she wouldn't have been on their radars by the time they cast Carol Danvers for <i>Age of Ultron</i>. Just <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476933/disneys-what-if-series-is-incredibly-liberating-for-marvel-studios-kevin-feige-says">another "What If..." scenario</a> Disney+ could tackle.</p>
      <p>Marvel Studios' Infinity Saga box set is out there if you can afford it and can find one. It's packed with deleted scenes and some other content you won't find <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484681/when-disney-will-get-big-movies-like-black-panther-and-star-wars-the-last-jedi">in the movies on Disney+</a> (although there are <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484478/what-disneys-cut-endgame-scene-with-tony-stark-and-his-adult-daughter-reveals">some added scenes there too</a>) which is just another way for them to get your money.</p>
