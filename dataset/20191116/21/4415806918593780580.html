      <p>Nearly 500 gardaí have faced disciplinary action in less than three years.</p>
      <p>Breaches of discipline can result in officers being sacked or having their wages cut.</p>
      <p>These figures show there has been a decline in disciplinary cases within the force over the past three years.</p>
      <p>The Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan released the figures to Fianna Fáil's Jim O' Callaghan following a request.</p>
      <p>They show 190 officers were punished in 2017, 167 in 2018 and so far this year 136 members of on An Garda Síochána have been disciplined.</p>
      <p>The numbers also include 14 sergeants or higher ranked gardaí this year.</p>
      <p>As part of the "Policing Service for the Future" report, a Discipline Review Committee has been set up to oversee the process.</p>
      <p>The Garda Representative Association have said some complaints made against officers come from 'public misconception'.</p>
      <p>"Some things can be very minor in nature," said Frank Thornton, vice-president of the GRA.</p>
      <p>"And some complaints, they come from public misconception of investigation and how they're conducted.</p>
      <p>"Once they're explained to the injured party they then become satisfied.</p>
      <p>"It's just a bit of a misconception, really, as to how they think investigations are run and should be run."</p>
