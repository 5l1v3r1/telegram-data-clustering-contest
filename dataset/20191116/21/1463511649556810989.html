      <p>Mistura Durosinlorun, a 12-year-old, defeated the number one seeded player, Favour Utukpe, in the U-16 category at the final of the 2019 edition of the Ex-Squash Pros Diaspora,.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the third edition of the Ex-Squash Pros Diaspora served off at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos on November 14 and will end on November 16.</p>
      <p>Durosinlorun told NAN that defeating the number seeded player would further boost her confidence during tournaments.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m so excited I won; last month, when we met at a tournament, Favour won, then I made up my mind to keep pushing.</p>
      <p>“I know I need to sustain this so I need to train harder to remain consistent, and I intend to give it all it takes.”</p>
      <p>NAN reports that 14-year Utukpe lost 3-1 to Durosinlorun.</p>
      <p>Temitope Olusoji, a player who came to watch the finals, attributed Utukpe’s loss to her new found love for social media.</p>
      <p>Olusoji said: “Since she got her phone, she began to cut down on the number of hours she trains for.</p>
      <p>“That phone distracted her.</p>
      <p>“If she probably didn’t have the phone she would have won.”</p>
      <p>In her defence, Utukpe told NAN that she feels miserable losing to Durosinlorun at the finals.</p>
      <p>She said: “Words cannot describe how I feel right now; it’s even more painful because I don’t know where these assumptions are coming from.</p>
      <p>“My mum bought the phone for me and she only gave it to me recently, so it’s not true.</p>
      <p>“If I had won, they won’t be saying all these.</p>
      <p>“I will just train hard for a comeback.</p>
      <p>“This is a temporary setback.</p>
      <p>“The better player won today.”</p>
      <p>In the finals of the U-13 category for boys, Dominion Utukpe of Lagos State defeated Daniel Nzei of Akwa Ibom 3-1.</p>
      <p>For U-13 girls, Durosinlorun of Kwara State defeated Jennifer Madukaozor of Abia 3-1.</p>
      <p>For U-16 category for boys, Wisdom Nzei of Akwa Ibom defeated Joseph Eniafoghe of Head Waters Academy 3-2.</p>
      <p>In the first edition of the above 45 category, in the women’s category, Osarumwense Ogbemi defeated Sadia Akande 2-0 .</p>
      <p>In the over 45 men, Daniel Enaholo defeated Yusuf Durosinlorun 2-0, father of Mistura and the Tournament Director.</p>
