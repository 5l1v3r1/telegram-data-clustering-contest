      </p>
      <p>Kristina Aburrow, 34, suffered a gaping four-inch wound after the fierce dog clamped its jaws round her left limb.</p>

      <p>Nerve and muscle damage caused permanent numbness and she couldn’t dress, make meals or cycle for four months due to PTSD.</p>
      <p>Kristina — who won compensation — told how a woman walking two of the mutts crossed her path before one targeted her in Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>She said: “I can’t describe the panic and fear of seeing this giant animal tear at you. The teeth. The snarling. It was terrifying. I genuinely thought it would rip my arm off.</p>
      <p>“Whenever I walk past big dogs I feel my heart pound.”</p>

      <p>She blasted cops for taking no action against the owner.</p>
      <p>But she scooped a five-figure payout from her over the attack in September last year.</p>

      <p>Kristina, who runs kids’ art classes, added: “There was no reason for that dog to go for me — but what if a child walked past it instead of me?</p>
      <p>“We rely on the police to help society and victims by keeping bad owners in check.</p>
      <p>“For there to be no further action then is baffling.”</p>
      <p>Robert Kernaghan, partner at Digby Brown Solicitors’ Dundee office, helped secure rightful damages. He said: “This was a truly traumatic incident for our client.</p>
      <p>“It’s vital victims know there are other ways to secure justice.”</p>
      <p>Police said: “Following enquiries, no crime was established.”</p>
