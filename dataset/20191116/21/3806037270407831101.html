      <p>A little over two weeks after the debut of a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/j-balvin-ian-delucca-spongebob-squarepants-grillz-collab"><i>Spongebob Squarepants</i>-themed Grillz collaboration with Ian Delucca</a>, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/j-balvin">J Balvin</a> is serving up a brand new solo record and its accompanying visual. Known as “BLANCO,” the globe-trotting superstar’s latest single is billed as a “hymn to Medellin” and serves as his first new track since the June release of his joint project with Bad Bunny, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/6/j-balvin-bad-bunny-oasis-album-stream"><i>OASIS</i></a>. For the song’s music video, J Balvin turns to popular director Colin Tilley, who takes a futuristic approach to the clip’s narrative and setting.</p>
      <p>“It’s beautiful to see how far my music can go; numbers don’t lie,” J Balvin shared with <i>The Guardian</i> earlier this year, opening up about his artistic motivations, goals and purpose for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/27/j-balvin-on-breakdowns-escobar-and-beyonce-reggaeton">July profile</a>. “I want to be that guy to make Spanish music global so I’m going to keep pushing it … it’s something Latino people have been working on for 100 years and now we’re seeing the effects … I know I’ve got a mission and the mission is to be inspiring, inspire the world. Good vibes. I represent culture, I represent youth, I represent the people that follow me. Because what we have is power, people listen to us.”</p>
