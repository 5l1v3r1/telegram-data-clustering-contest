      <h1>Neal Ardley believes big claim from National League rivals about Notts County has been shot down</h1>
      <h2>Magpies were beaten 3-0 by Barrow at the weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley insisted that Notts County’s convincing defeat to promotion-chasing Barrow has shot down claims that they are the best side in the National League.</p>
      <p>The Magpies were thumped 3-0 by Ian Evatt’s side at Meadow Lane on Saturday which was their first home defeat since Barnet triumped 2-1 in August.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> were 2-0 down after 13 minutes after goals from Dior Angus and John Rooney, before substitute Jack Hindle added a third in the second half.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> confessed that his team performed well below the standards they have set this season which had seen them lost just three of their last 19 games ahead of Saturday’s contest.</p>
      <p>That had led to some managers claiming they were the best team in the league, but the Notts boss said Barrow proved that wasn’t the case.</p>

      <p>“We’ve been shown we are not the best team in the league like people are saying,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Part of me is disappointed and we deserved the boos when you play like that, but part of me feels that we have come a hell of a long way.</p>
      <p>“And sometimes you have bad days in the office.”</p>
