      <p>After a blow-out 38-7 win over Mississippi State on Saturday it is now being reported that Tua Tagovailoa’s hip injury is very serious. Some are even comparing it to the one that ended Bo Jackson’s career.</p>
      <p>Dr. Mark Adickes took to twitter and tweeted out the following.</p>
      <p>Nick Saban had this to say:</p>
      <blockquote>“I really don’t know at this point. We’ve got to do some MRIs and some things, but it’s a hip injury and that’s probably something that could be serious. So we just have to wait and see,” Saban said. (<a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/16/nick-saban-tua-tagovailoas-injury-could-be-serious/">NBC SPORTS</a>)</blockquote>
