      <h2>MK Shaked warns Israel may be in for new elections, says she supports Defense Min. Bennett's appointment to his post.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T21:33:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 21:33</time> by <a rel="author">Arutz Sheva Staff</a></address>
      <p>Former Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked (New Right) on Saturday evening told<i> Channel 12</i>'s "Meet the Press" program that MK Naftali Bennett's <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271333">appointment as Defense Minister</a> was done with her full consent.</p>
      <p>"The fact that Bennett was appointed Defense Minister was something I was in favor of and agreed to, even urgently," she said. "I think it is good for Israel that he's Defense Minister. Prime Minister is the hardest job in the entire world, and it's good to have a full-time Defense Minister, and good that it's Naftali Bennett."</p>
      <p>"It was a joint process and a joint decision," she added. "We went into politics to do good for the State, not to warm chairs. We love to work, and the moment Netanyahu gave us a choice between two of the available portfolios and the defense portfolio, we agreed that we would take the defense portfolio. There's a long history of partnership here - sometimes I give in, sometimes he gives in."</p>
      <p>According to Shaked, Israel is well on its way to a third round of elections within a year.</p>
      <p>"We're on our way to new elections," she emphasized. "I very much hope not, but unfortunately we're headed towards elections, and it could be that we won't have a permanent government for many more months, so it's good that there's a Defense Minister, and it's good that it's Bennett."</p>
      <p>Shaked also responded to Operation Black Belt - Israel's recent operations in Gaza following<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271632"> the launch of hundreds of rockets</a> at Israeli civilians.</p>
      <p>"There's a difference between an operation we initiate, and attacks on Israel," she said. "Here Israel initiated, and that's a good thing. The State of Israel wanted <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271500">to eliminate that terrorist</a> and be done with it. We didn't plan a large widescale battle. The elimination was carried out a few hours before Bennett took office. He was updated. After the elimination was carried out, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271440">the scepter was passed to Bennett</a> in an organized fashion."</p>
      <p>"Bennett set four goals, and the defense system met them all. One, to eliminate as many terrorists as possible during that opportunity. Two, that as few Israeli civilians as possible should be harmed. Three, that the fighting should end as quickly as possible. And four, that we should not have any limitations placed on us."</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271643">Thursday's ceasefire agreement</a> stipulated that Israel end targeted eliminations and the shooting of violent protesters on the Gaza border fence, and demanded that Gaza terror groups end the rocket fire on Israel and conduct the border protests peacefully.</p>
