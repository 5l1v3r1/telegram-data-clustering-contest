      <h1>Lee McGregor edges Kash Farooq to unify titles in controversial all-Scottish thriller</h1>
      <h2>Lightning is now the unified British and Commonwealth champion after earning a surprise nod on the scorecards.</h2>

      <p>In a candidate for 2019’s Fight of the Year, Lee McGregor won a controversial split decision to keep his Commonwealth bantamweight title and take Kash Farooq’s British crown.</p>
      <p>The pair delivered the goods in one of the most exciting <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/boxing/">boxing</a> dust-ups of the year at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/emirates-arena">Emirates Arena</a> in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/">Glasgow</a> .</p>
      <p>McGregor tried to bully his opponent but struggled to lay a glove on him, while Farooq landed more and better shots to claim the advantage in the third.</p>
      <p>That made McGregor switch tactics, trying to keep his foe at arm’s length while scoring with the jab but he was again staggered by a couple of big right hands from the Glaswegian, who appeared to have shaded the fourth as well.</p>
      <p>He didn’t rest on his laurels, though. Farooq punished McGregor by driving right and left hooks to the body in the fifth round, with the Saughton man looking tired.</p>
      <p>The Commonwealth champ landed some good uppercuts in the sixth but he was again outworked by Farooq. McGregor had a second wind in the seventh, landing three successive right uppercuts which slowed Farooq down but didn’t stop him.</p>

      <p>However, Farooq’s fitness told in the eighth when he outworked and outpunched his man, who also landed blows of his own – just not as many. McGregor switched to southpaw but couldn’t keep Farooq at bay. He pushed Farooq through the ropes in the ninth but referee Victor Loughlin refused to deduct a point from him.</p>
      <p>McGregor was finally penalised for holding in the 10th  and that left him needing a KO to win it. He edged the 11th but that wasn’t going to be enough. Farooq just needed to stay on his feet and he walked through a big right as the Edinburgh man pushed for the Hail Mary punch.</p>
      <p>McGregor started and finished strongly but Farooq appeared to outwork and outpunch his rival and a rematch must surely be on the cards.</p>
      <p>The decision of one judge to award McGregor the decision by 115-112 – after he had had a point deducted – was outrageous.</p>
      <p>McGregor said: “I was confident I had won but with the point off I knew it would be close.</p>
      <p>“If you go on social media it will be split down the middle again, with some people saying McGregor by one and others <br/>saying Farooq by one.”</p>
