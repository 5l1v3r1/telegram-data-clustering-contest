      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> ended their interest in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-maguire/">Harry Maguire</a> in 2018 after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> warned them spending more than £50million on the defender would ‘embarrass him’, reports say.</p>
      <p>United tried to sign Maguire four months before Mourinho’s sacking, with the Portuguese <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/30/jose-mourinho-expects-manchester-united-to-sign-defender-in-january-transfer-window-8089439/">insisting he needed an elite centre-back</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jose-mourinho-refused-pay-more-20895867?2">Mirror</a> claim United <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/26/harry-maguire-says-he-respects-leicesters-decision-to-block-manchester-united-move-7883461/">went after Leicester City’s Maguire</a>, but were told by the Foxes they would not sell for any figure less than £60m.</p>
      <p>Mourinho insisted a fee over £50m would be embarrassing, prompting United to walk away from talks with Leicester.</p>

      <p>United would eventually sign Maguire a year later, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/05/manchester-united-confirm-record-harry-maguire-transfer-10511664/">paid a staggering £80million for his services</a>.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if Maguire can live up to that price tag, but the England international has improved United’s defence since joining their ranks.</p>

      <p>Were United to have pushed ahead with plans to sign Maguire in the summer of 2018, they could have saved £20m.</p>
      <p>Mourinho would leave the club before the end of the year, but not before he repeatedly insisted the club had not backed him in the transfer market.</p>
      <p>While Maguire and his team-mates have struggled for consistency this season, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes the defender is a future captain at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>‘I think he’s been brilliant,’ said Solskjaer of Maguire.</p>

      <p>‘I think he’s come into the dressing room, been a leader, he’s also a leader on the pitch and I’m sure he’s looking forward to playing against his old team.</p>
      <p>‘Now he’s here he’s going to be a big part of the future of this club, we’ve watched him enough to know he’s the guy we wanted, that’s why we spent the money we did on him.</p>

      <p>‘He’s a definitely a character and personality that can be captain of a big club, in the dressing room he’s a leader by performances, stature and behaviour, he’s a character you’d like to follow, some are technical leaders, some are leaders by voice, he’s got the lot.’</p>
