        <b>Due to start the Brazilian Grand Prix in 14th place, Charles Leclerc promised not to hold back once the race begins.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Charles Leclerc has vowed to be in “full attack mode” in the Brazilian Grand Prix after a disappointing qualifying session left the Ferrari driver due to start in 14th place.</p>
      <p>Already aware he had a 10-place grid penalty coming into Saturday, Leclerc was only fourth fastest at Interlagos behind pole-sitter Max Verstappen, team-mate Sebastian Vettel and world champion Lewis Hamilton.</p>
      <p>The Monegasque felt his car had the pace to record the fastest time and reverse the momentum from a poor race in Austin last time out, which was followed up by a penalty for taking a new power unit.</p>
      <p>Leclerc entirely blamed himself for his failure to reach the top of the timesheets on a weekend that could be pivotal as he battles Verstappen and Vettel to finish third in the drivers’ championship.</p>
      <p>Asked what his approach would be on Sunday, Leclerc said: “Full attack mode.</p>
      <p>“I enjoy starting in the back anytime, though I enjoy a little bit less when I’m fighting for third place in the championship.</p>
      <p>“But it’s life, it’s like this and I’ll try to enjoy it as much as possible and come back.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t think the pole was out of reach,” added Leclerc, who was 0.220 seconds behind Verstappen in a session that saw the top drivers closely bunched together.</p>
      <p>“I’m very disappointed with myself, I did quite a big mistake on my first timed lap in the first corner which cost me at least three-tenths so it’s my fault and I take [responsibility for] it completely.</p>
      <p>“The team did a great job, I think the car was there to fight for pole at least and I didn’t do the job in the car.</p>
      <p>“Anyway, I’ve got a 10-place grid penalty, so it was always going to be a difficult day.”</p>
      <p>Despite his frustration, Leclerc’s seven poles made him the standout performer in qualifying across 2019.</p>

      <p>Hamilton, meanwhile, was thrilled to split the Ferraris despite struggling for power in his Mercedes.</p>
      <p>“It’s always nice, it puts a smile on my face,” he told Sky Sports of splitting Vettel and Leclerc.</p>
      <p>“My approach is pretty much the same all year long, but maybe we can try and be a bit more aggressive with these guys now [the title is won].</p>
      <p>“Congrats to Max, a great lap by him. We seemed to be quite competitive in FP3 and then we seemed to lose in qualifying or they gained.</p>
      <p>“Nonetheless I’m really happy I was able to divide the Ferraris – it’s always a tough challenge. We’ve been down on power I guess compared to the others, that’s where we lost our time.</p>
      <p>“I gave it absolutely everything. My best lap of the session was the last one, so… awesome.”</p>
