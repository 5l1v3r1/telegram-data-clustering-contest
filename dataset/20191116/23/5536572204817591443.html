      <h1>Kaepernick To NFL Scouts After Workout: ‘Tell Your Owners To Stop Being Scared’ (VIDEOS)</h1>

      <p>After a lot of adjustments, Colin Kaepernick showed up and showed out on saturday in front of NFL scouts.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the NFL sent out a memo to all 32 teams saying the free agent quarterback would essentially have a Pro Day in Atlanta at the Falcons practice facility, but that fell apart about half an hour before the event and it was subsequently moved to Charles Drew High School.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick was so good during his workout that one NFL executive reportedly said the quarterback still has “elite” arm talent.</p>

      <p>Before he left the high school, Kaepernick had a strong message for the scouts to tell their team owners.</p>
