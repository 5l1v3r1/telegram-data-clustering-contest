      <h1>Where Brett Gardner, Didi Gregorius stand in possible Yankees return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:46:38+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Martin</a></address>
      <p>It’s been four weeks since the Yankees’ season ended in Houston in Game 6 of the ALCS.</p>
      <p>Following the loss, both Brett Gardner and Didi Gregorius expressed their desire to remain with the Yankees.</p>
      <p>Since then, each has hit free agency, and the Yankees declined to give Gregorius a qualifying offer, which means they won’t get any draft compensation if he signs elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Despite the pair of longtime Yankees being on the open market, general manager Brian Cashman hasn’t ruled out bringing them back to The Bronx.</p>
      <p>Cashman spoke with their agents at the GM meetings last week in Scottsdale, Ariz., and there are still reasons to have both veteran players on the roster in 2020.</p>
      <p>Cashman added last week that even as time goes on during the offseason, it doesn’t necessarily diminish the chances they will return.</p>
      <p>“I can’t tell you it’s less likely or more likely,’’ Cashman said, referring specifically to Gregorius, who has been said to have drawn interest from one of his former teams, the Reds.</p>
      <p>“[Gregorius] has been a great player for us,’’ Cashman said. “He’s a free agent now. There’s competition for his services. We’ll continue to engage and see if we can continue the relationship or not. I can’t predict it.”</p>

      <p>Gregorius made $11.75 million last season and figured to be on his way to a multi-year deal that could have at least approached $80 million-$100 million over four or five years. But following offseason Tommy John surgery a year ago, Gregorius’ performance suffered when he returned in June.</p>
      <p>The Yankees could move Gleyber Torres to shortstop — with DJ LeMahieu at second, Luke Voit at first and Gio Urshela or Miguel Andujar at third — if they move on from Gregorius and don’t make a trade.</p>
      <p>Gardner, 36, just finished one of his finest seasons, and with Aaron Hicks likely out at least the first several months of next season because of Tommy John surgery, could slide back into the role he had last year.</p>
      <p>“He clearly put himself in a great position this winter because of the year he had,” Cashman said. “He’s been a great Yankee and I’d love for that to continue. We’ll see where he wants to work in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Gardner and Gregorius last spoke in the aftermath of the Yankees’ loss in Houston.</p>
      <p>Gregorius admitted he wasn’t sure where his first foray into free agency would take him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t even know where I’m gonna be, so that’s the thing,’’ Gregorius said in the visiting clubhouse at Minute Maid Park. “Who knows what gonna happen?”</p>
      <p>Asked if he wants to stay with the Yankees, Gregorius said, “Yes.”</p>
      <p>Outside Yankee Stadium a few days later, Gardner said, “I’ve always been open about wanting to play my whole career here. I hope I get the opportunity to do that. It’s been a good run, and hopefully it keeps going.’’</p>
