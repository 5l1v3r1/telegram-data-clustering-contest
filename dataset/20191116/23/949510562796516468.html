      <p>SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — The Florida Panthers’ power play had another big night taking advantage of the New York Rangers’ struggles on special teams.</p>
      <p>Evgenii Dadonov scored twice to lead the Panthers to a 4-3 win over the Rangers on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Florida went 2-for-3 on the man advantage, scoring twice in the first period for 11 goals on their last 30 power-play opportunities.</p>
      <p>“The playmaking they make before the shot is pretty special,” said Florida coach Joel Quenneville, who won his 900th game — second all-time in the NHL. “Each and every guy has two or three different options when they do touch the puck which is tough to defend.”</p>
      <p>Mike Hoffman and Brett Connolly also scored, and Jonathan Huberdeau and Keith Yandle each had three assists for the Panthers. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 30 shots to improve to 7-4-4.</p>
      <p>Huberdeau increased his career total to 252 assists, taking over the franchise record after coming in tied with Stephen Weiss.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice, obviously,” said Huberdeau, who has 27 points in Florida’s 20 games. “I couldn’t do it without a lot of the guys here.”</p>
      <p>Ryan Strome, Artemi Panarin and Tony DeAngelo scored for the Rangers, and Henrik Lundqvist finished with 26 saves.</p>
      <p>The two clubs played a 6-5 shootout thriller last Sunday in Madison Square Garden, and Saturday’s match started out fast with four goals in the first 8:47.</p>
      <p>Hoffman and Dadonov netted goals at 2:05 and 6:50, respectively, giving the Panthers markers on the man advantage in nine straight games.</p>
      <p>After going just 3-for-8 on the penalty kill in a 9-3 loss against Tampa Bay on Thursday, the Rangers were able to kill off just one — an abbreviated 32-second one by Florida.</p>
      <p>Rangers coach David Quinn benched his two offenders in the first period — Pavel Buchnevich and Micheal Haley.</p>
      <p>“That’s going to happen over and over again if you take a lazy penalty,” Quinn said. “I should’ve done that 16 games ago. … We take two stupid penalties to start the game, and they capitalize on it. We’ve given up seven (power-play) goals in two games and (19) on the year.”</p>
      <p>New York also failed to score on its three power plays.</p>
      <p>Still, the Rangers tied the second meeting between the teams both times, first with Strome’s sixth goal at 2:39 and Panarin’s ninth at 8:47.</p>
      <p>Panarin’s assist on a quick pass to DeAngelo led to his sixth goal and the Rangers’ first lead at 5:47 of the second, but Connolly’s snipe at 7:51, his seventh tally, tied it 3-3.</p>
      <p>Florida carried the final 4-3 margin into the third after Dadonov got his 10th goal from the right circle off a cross-ice pass from Yandle with 2:16 left in the second.</p>
      <p>“I got over late and my skate hit the post. There must have been a hole there between the pad and the post,” Lundqvist said of the game-winning goal. “If I’d have had more time, I’d probably have come across and been outside the post, but I was late.”</p>
      <p>Standout goaltending by Bobrovsky helped kill off a power play with 4:29 remaining to prevent Florida from losing its second straight regulation game for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Quinn coached his 100th NHL game. … New York scratched C Mika Zibanejad, RW Kaapo Kakko and D Marc Staal. … Panarin has an 11-game point streak (five goals, 12 assists). … The Panthers held “Hockey Fights Cancer Night,” an annual event. Said Florida’s Brian Boyle, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 2017: “It’s a great initiative. The amount of good it’s done is an awesome thing. I’m a beneficiary of that research and money.” … The former Rangers forward, who played for New York from 2009-14, scored his first career hat trick on Nov. 5, 2018, while playing for the New Jersey Devils in their “Hockey Fights Cancer Night” — just two weeks after Boyle learned his form of bone marrow cancer was in full remission. … Florida scratched C Jayce Hawryluk and D MacKenzie Weegar.</p>
