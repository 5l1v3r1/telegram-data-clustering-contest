      <h1>Vodafone Idea plans to monetise data centres</h1>

      <p>Vodafone Idea said it was exploring the monetisation of data centres as part of its debt reduction plans. Apart from data centres, Vodafone Idea is planning to monetise its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers on completion of the Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel merger, and is also exploring monetisation of nearly 1.6 lakh km of fibre. “We believe this will provide us financial flexibility,” Vodafone Idea MD &amp; CEO Ravinder Takkar said.</p>
      <p>Gross debt on Vodafone Idea as of September 30, 2019 was ₹1,17,300 crore including deferred spectrum payment obligations of ₹89,170 crore to the government .</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea on Thursday reported a consolidated loss of ₹ 50,921 crore — the highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate — for the September quarter on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court’s order in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case.</p>
      <p>The company has estimated liability of ₹44,150 crore post the apex court order, and made provisioning of ₹25,680 crore in the second quarter this fiscal. The company also set aside ₹4,822 crore for certain assets that it may not be able to use due to shifting of network from 3G to 4G technology.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea also derecognised the deferred tax assets amounting to ₹13,940 crore recorded up to June 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court, last month, ruled in favour of the government and directed telecom companies, including Vodafone Idea, to pay dues as demanded by the Department of Telecom.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea has said its ability to continue business will depend on relief sought from the government and positive outcome of the legal option it has (filing of a review petition).</p>
      <p>It said the company, through the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), has made representations to the government to provide relief to the telecom sector.</p>
      <p>This includes request to not press for the AGR liability payment and grant waivers, not levying spectrum usage charges (SUC) on non-licenced revenue, reduction of licence fee and SUC rates and use of GST credit for payment of government levies.</p>
      <p>The industry body has requested the government to allow payment to be made in installments after some moratorium, and grant a moratorium of two years for the payment of spectrum dues beyond April 1, 2020 up to March 31, 2022.</p>
