      <h1>Urban Meyer Reacts To Tua Tagovailoa’s Devastating Injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:23:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Urban Meyer knows what it’s like to see his star quarterback go down with a devastating injury. Both Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett suffered serious injuries during his time at Ohio State.</p>
      <p>The FOX Sports college football analyst has thus shared his reaction to the devastating injury to Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/breaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">who suffered a season-ending injury against Mississippi State today</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was just staring at Coach Saban’s face and he was hurting,” Meyer said on FOX. “We’re all hurting for a kid like that. That’s the worst thing about this sport is injury and having to deal with it.”</p>
      <p>Meyer then addressed Saban’s somewhat controversial decision to keep Tagovailoa in the game with Alabama up big. The Crimson Tide’s head coach said he wanted to get Tagovailoa one more drive and some practice in a two-minute drill.</p>
      <p>“He made the comment about the two-minute drill, I certainly understand that,” Meyer said. “Is it the right thing or the wrong thing, that’s his decision to make with the player involved.”</p>

      <p>Meyer finished with a story about one of his star quarterbacks, Tim Tebow. Then at Florida, Meyer had decided to not play Tebow against LSU following an injury. Tebow ended up talking his way into the game.</p>
      <p>“I mean a big-time game at night at LSU, and he gets cleared,” Meyer said. “I said, ‘Tim, I’m not going to play you. On Thursday, him and his father come to my house, and say, I mean like angrily, ‘What gives you the right to not play me.’ I said, ‘Tim, I’m the head coach, I’m not playing you.’ He said, ‘The doctors, the professionals have allowed me to play, I’m going to play. We got into it a little bit. I ended up playing him just because he was that adamant.”</p>
      <p>Alabama, meanwhile, will now turn to quarterback Mac Jones, who finished the game against Mississippi State. He’ll play next week against Western Carolina and the following weekend against Auburn.</p>
