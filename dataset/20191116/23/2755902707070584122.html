      <p>BREAKING: Chief Ndiweni removed as chief with immediate effect</p>
      <p>Outspoken Nhlanhlayamangwe Felix Ndiweni of Nhlambabaloyi commonly known as Chief Ndiweni has been removed as Chief by the Matabeleland North Provincial Chief’s Council. The Traditional leaders met today at Rainbow Towers in Bulawayo and passed the resolution.</p>

      <p>According to reports by <a href="https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-174683.html">Byo24</a>, Ndiweni was removed because his appointment was not in accordance with the traditional leaders act as he was not the firstborn son. The notion to remove Ndiweni was moved by a Chief from Binga and the resolution to oust Ndiweni was passed unanimously.</p>
      <p>The decision now awaits approval by the National Chiefs council. Ndiweni has been an outspoken critic of the Mnangagwa regime and the demotion is being viewed by many as politically motivated. Earlier this year <a href="https://iharare.com/chief-ndiweni-thrown-behind-bars/">Ndiweni was arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for allegedly damaging a villager’s property</a>.He was later released on bail pending appeal.</p>
