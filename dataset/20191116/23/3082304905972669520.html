        <b>Former world number four and 2010 Wimbledon Tomas Berdych says his body will not allow him to continue playing at the highest level.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tomas Berdych has confirmed his retirement at the age of 34.</p>
      <p>The former world number four was expected to quit after posting a video on Twitter stating he had an announcement to make at the ATP Finals in London on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Berdych’s post came after a Czech tabloid Blesk reported on Wednesday that he will officially bring the curtain down on his career this weekend.</p>
      <p>The 2010 Wimbledon runner-up, beaten by Rafael Nadal in his only grand slam final, has now brought his playing days to an end after 17 years on the ATP Tour.</p>

      <p>Berdych has not played since losing to Jenson Brooksby in the first round of the US Open, having been blighted by a back injury.</p>
      <p>The 13-time ATP Tour singles champion missed the last five months of the 2018 season and was only able to play 22 matches this year.</p>
      <p>Berdych’s career was recognised during a ceremony at the O2 Arena on Saturday, where he said: “The feeling I went through in my last official match was one that told me I tried absolutely everything, but the end result is how it is.</p>
      <p>“The level I was always chasing, the top results, being in the top positions [of the ATP Rankings]… My body doesn’t allow me to do so.</p>
      <p>“I always look at situations very realistically. I was standing with my feet on my ground. When I made my decision with myself and [loved ones], I felt a big relief.”</p>
