      <p>Shortly after fans of the bombshell took to the comments to state the strong family resemblance between Sophie and Amy.</p>
      <p>A social-media user who could see the similarities between the mother and daughter penned: "That's fantastic she looks just like your lovely mum!"</p>
      <p>"Such a kind young woman and a lovely friend keep up the good work Sophie xx," added another.</p>
      <p>A Instagram user typed: "She really looks like your mum x."</p>

      <p>Katie and Sophie's mum Amy is sadly terminally ill.</p>
      <p>Amy has been given just five years to live after she was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2017.</p>
      <p>Amy has moved to Spain after finding the cold winter in Britain was making her illness worse - and admitted she may have to be put on oxygen to do exercise.</p>
      <p>She recently opened up on her illness during an appearance alongside Katie on Loose Women.</p>
      <p>"I'm not too bad, I went for tests this week with the transplant team, my lung function has dropped slightly but that's to be expected," she told.</p>

      <p>"They test other organs to prepare you if you need a transplant, they're still 100% fine. At the moment they're saying you're too healthy, go out and enjoy yourself."</p>
      <p>Amy, who still enjoys exercise despite how breathless it leaves her, was cut off by Katie, who admitted she often jokes about her mum dying.</p>
      <p>"I get the violin out, I say 'you haven't gone yet then'," Katie said.</p>

      <p>"When you first hear 'terminal' you think, oh god it could be next week, next month..."</p>
      <p>Amy is now hoping to be put on a trial for a new research drug, but doesn't hold out much hope for a donated lung, because "you need to be nearly dead to get a transplant".</p>
      <p>Katie added: "I thought it would be easy to donate a lung, obviously you'd do anything for your mum but she wouldn't hear of it."</p>
      <p>Amy was diagnosed with IDF nearly two years ago. The rare condition causes progressive and irreversible scarring of the lungs.</p>
