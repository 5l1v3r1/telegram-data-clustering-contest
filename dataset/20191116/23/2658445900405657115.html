      <p>These days, Africa’s fashion industry is growing at an incredible pace; this year, market estimates put the worth of the industry at billions of naira. And if you are up to date in the world of style, then you would know that Lagos is now globally renowned as fashion capital in Africa.</p>
      <p>No one overlooks Lagos fashion shows anymore, neither the world renowned fashion shows nor the biggest fashion brands, all of which some ways arebeing inspired by African designs. Fashion shows in Nigeria and across the world have always been known more for their glitz and glamour, and the GTBank Fashion Weekend takes no backseat in the dazzle department.</p>
      <p>Classiness and style are the words that describe the dazzling range of fashion merchandise that rocked the GTB Fashion Week 2019. And keeping in tune with the changing styles and fads has been the essential features.</p>
      <p>The event, the fourth in the series, was held last weekend – 9th  and 10th, November 2019, amidst glitz, glamour and style at the popular GTCentre, Plot 1, Water Corporation Drive, Oniru, Lagos. It brought together the crème de la crème of the Nigerian and international fashion industry. It also connected them with fashion leaders abroad – through series of master classes in order to build local capacity and expertise in turning fashion ideas into successful businesses. We present the best runway looks from the ready-to-wear and couture collections during the event.</p>
