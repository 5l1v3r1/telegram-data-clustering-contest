      <h1>Patrick Mahomes Sends Message To Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:21:11+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Alabama’s star quarterback suffered a season-ending injury.</p>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa, who entered the game with a questionable designation, was carted off the field after dislocating his hip.</p>
      <p>According to a report from Aaron Suttles, Tua also suffered a fracture in the hip. “Tua Tagovailoa is out for the season with a dislocated hip with a posterior wall fracture, a person with knowledge of the situation tells me,” Suttles reported.</p>
      <p>With just two games left in the regular season, Tagovailoa’s season is over.</p>
      <p>After the news broke that Tua suffered a season-ending injury, college football fans, players and others wished the best for the star quarterback.</p>
      <p>Now a star NFL quarterback has weighed in. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes sent a message to the injured Tua.</p>
      <p>“Prayers up Tua, hope this is just a minor setback in a bright future!” Mahomes said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>It’s a classy message from the reigning NFL MVP.</p>
      <p>Mahomes came back from his own injury this season. He suffered a dislocated kneecap during a Thursday night game against the Denver Broncos. He returned just three weeks later.</p>
      <p>Hopefully Tua can recover from what appears to be a very serious injury.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
