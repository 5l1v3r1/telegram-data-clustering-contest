      <h1>Colin Kaepernick Reportedly Got “Very Positive Feedback” From His Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:39:32+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick ticked off the NFL on Saturday, but it’s possible he may have landed himself a job in the league regardless. Kaepernick reportedly looked good in front of scouts and displayed “elite” arm talent.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick was slated to appear for an NFL-sanctioned workout at the Atlanta Falcons indoor facility in front of 25 teams at 3:00 PM ET. Less than an hour before the event, however, Kaepernick’s team announced to the public that they’d be holding his actual workout elsewhere – at a school about an hour from Atlanta.</p>
      <p>The media was also invited. The NFL’s scheduled workout was not to include media.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Adam Schefter says an NFL executive told him that Kaepernick still had “elite” arm talent. Jason La Canfora also said that Kaepernick got “very positive feedback” from the event.</p>
      <p>Both reports suggest Kaepernick impressed with his ability to throw the deep ball.</p>

      <p>Scouts from a number of teams attended the event – even though it was rescheduled. The Eagles, Titans, 49ers, Lions, Jets, Redskins and Chiefs are all confirmed to have sent representatives.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether a team will take a shot on Kaepernick. We should find out in the coming days.</p>
