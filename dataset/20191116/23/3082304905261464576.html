      <h1>Inexperienced Germany not among Euros contenders – Toni Kroos</h1>

        <b>Germany have work to do if they are to be considered contenders at Euro 2020 despite cruising to qualification, says Toni Kroos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Toni Kroos acknowledges Germany are lacking experience and could not be considered Euro 2020 contenders as things stand, although he is not writing off their chances.</p>
      <p>Germany qualified for a record 13th European Championship with a 4-0 defeat of Belarus in Monchengladbach on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Matthias Ginter broke the deadlock at the end of a frustrating first half, before Leon Goretzka doubled the hosts’ lead and then Kroos struck twice.</p>
      <p>The scoreline belied some of the difficulties the 2014 world champions faced, though, reliant on Manuel Neuer to make three fine saves – including from Igor Stasevich’s penalty.</p>
      <p>Joachim Low has disposed of a number of senior men since a poor 2018 World Cup, and Kroos, one of the remaining established stars, sees there is work to do for a young group.</p>
      <p>“We are still lacking a little bit in experience, but certain procedures are working better and better,” he said, as reported by UEFA.com.</p>
      <p>“We will know where we stand shortly before the tournament. Currently, I would not count us amongst the top favourites. But that doesn’t always mean anything.”</p>

      <p>Like Kroos and Neuer, Ginter was central to the victory, having a hand in the second and third goals after scoring the opener at Borussia-Park, the home of club side Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
      <p>The smart flick was Ginter’s first strike for his country, prompting comment from Neuer that it was “about time”.</p>
      <p>“His first Germany goal tonight? Well, after 29 games, it is about time,” Neuer said. “No, he did very well to score in style.”</p>
      <p>Ginter added: “Scoring a goal like this as a central defender – that goes to show that nothing is impossible. Manu is right – after 29 games, it was about time.</p>
      <p>“Scoring here in Gladbach is the icing on the cake.”</p>
