        <b>There will be a first-time ATP Finals champion on Sunday after Dominic Thiem ended Alexander Zverev’s reign in London.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dominic Thiem will face Stefanos Tsitsipas for the ATP Finals title after dethroning Alexander Zverev in straight sets.</p>
      <p>Thiem beat Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to reach the last four of the season-ending tournament for the first time and dispatched Zverev 7-5 6-3 at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Zverev was unable to break the fifth seed, who was more composed than the defending champion and broke once in each set to set up a showdown with Tsitsipas – conqueror of Federer earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Thiem has won five titles in a stellar season and the two-time French Open runner-up will claim the biggest of his career if he gets the better of Tsitsipas on Sunday, having struck 21 winners in his sixth victory in eight meetings with Zverev.</p>

      <p>The first break point came for Zverev, but Thiem denied his close friend to level at 2-2 after unleashing one of a number of blistering backhands.</p>
      <p>Zverev saw another break point pass him by and it was his opponent – wearing exactly the same attire – who got the decisive break of a tight opening set.</p>
      <p>A couple of sloppy errors from Zverev gave Thiem two set points and the German thrashed his racket into the ground after returning to his chair following a costly double fault.</p>
      <p>Zverev headed off court after watching his racket fly up in the air when he drilled it against the hard court in fury and the seventh seed was a break down at 4-2 in the second following a string of unforced errors.</p>
      <p>Thiem got himself out of trouble when Zverev forced two break points in the next game and sealed victory with a forehand winner.</p>
