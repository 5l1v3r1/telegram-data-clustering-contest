      <p>Season 10 of <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills"><i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i></a> is currently filming, and rumors suggested the season was going to be a dud. Bravo boss <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/andy-cohen">Andy Cohen</a> is claiming the opposite after a recent interview with <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/16/andy-cohen-rhobh-season-10-spoilers-dramatic-alliances/"><i>The Hollywood Life</i></a>. The outlet caught up with Andy at BravoCon this weekend where he dished on the <i>RHOBH</i> ladies, saying that fans are going to be “really surprised” with what’s to come in Season 10.</p>
      <p>“We’re in the middle of shooting and it’s very dramatic and it’s unusual that we got the women together while they’re shooting,” Andy noted. “Certain alliances have shifted. There’s been a lot of new friendships and friendships that have dissolved, and I think people are going to be really surprised to see where it’s gone.”</p>
      <p>Andy’s tease about alliances comes as quite the shock since most of the cast was united during Season 9. It was <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/lisa-vanderpump">Lisa Vanderpump</a> versus everyone as the restauranteur was blamed for leaking a Puppygate story involving Dorit Kemsley to the press. Lisa denied the allegations and all of her friendships with the women dissolved, causing her to quit the show mid-filming. How these alliances will now rearrange themselves will be quite interesting for viewers to watch play out.</p>

      <p>It was revealed last week that former cast members Camille Grammer, Brandi Glanville, Eileen Davidson, and Kim Richards <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5731438/camille-grammer-rhobh-diamond/">were all brought in</a> to shoot scenes with the main group of women, which sparked the rumors of Season 10 being a bore. Camille and Brandi have even gotten into a Twitter war and some of the season’s biggest drama might not surround the big wigs like <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/kyle-richards">Kyle Richards</a> and Erika Girardi. There haven’t been many rumors teasing new feuds on the series, but the show will introduce two newcomers. <i>NYPD Blue</i> star Garcelle Beauvais will make her<i> Housewives</i> debut alongside <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/lisa-rinna">Lisa Rinna’s</a> friend Sutton Stracke. The two women could bring the drama Andy has been teasing.</p>
      <p>Andy also commented on Lisa Vanderpump’s possible return to the franchise, and it looks like the door is never closed.</p>

      <p>“I saw her last week,” he stated. “Listen, she’s still very much a part of Bravo with <i>Vanderpump Rules</i> and the door’s always open for when she wants to come back.”</p>
      <p>The Bravo producer is not upset with LVP over her decision to leave <i>RHOBH</i>, noting that appearing on Bravo’s reality shows is “a voluntary process.”</p>
      <blockquote>“If you don’t want to be on, you don’t have to be on. We’re good.”</blockquote>
      <p><i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> Season 10 is set to return in early 2020. Season 8 of <i>Vanderpump Rules</i> will premiere on January 7 at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p>
