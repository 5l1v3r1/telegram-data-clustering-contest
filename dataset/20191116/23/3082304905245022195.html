      <h1>Virgil Van Dijk thrilled as Netherlands end big-stage absence by reaching Euro 2020</h1>

        <b>Netherlands clinched Euro 2020 qualification by drawing away to Northern Ireland, and captain Virgil van Dijk vowed to savour the success.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Captain Virgil van Dijk said Netherlands would enjoy the moment after qualifying for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The Dutch ended their self-inflicted exile from major tournament football, having failed to reach Euro 2016 or last year’s World Cup, when a 0-0 draw away to Northern Ireland secured a top-two finish in Group C.</p>
      <p>Netherlands were without the injured Memphis Depay and carried little threat up front in his absence, while Northern Ireland’s Steven Davis missed a first-half penalty that would have ramped up pressure on Ronald Koeman’s men.</p>
      <p>But in the end the visitors secured the primary objective for the night – the certainty they will be in next summer’s 24-team European Championship.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk, who won the Champions League with Liverpool last season, told Dutch broadcaster NOS: “We’re going to a tournament again. That’s the most important thing.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to win today and we had chances. We knew it would be difficult but in the end we qualified – how doesn’t really matter very much.</p>
      <p>“In the last 15 minutes, Northern Ireland started to play more directly, hoping for free-kicks and corners. It was up to us to stay sharp and we did very well at times.</p>
      <p>“We are going to the European Championship, let’s just enjoy it now. We will prepare ourselves well for that.”</p>

      <p>Northern Ireland can still qualify by the play-off route, while Netherlands appear likely to finish as group runners-up behind Germany, whom they trail by two points.</p>
      <p>The Germans round off their qualifying campaign with a home clash against Northern Ireland next Tuesday, and on the same night Netherlands play host to Estonia.</p>
