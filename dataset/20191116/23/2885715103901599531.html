      <p>Symbiosis International and MIT-WPU jointly organised a condolence meeting in memory of former Chief Election Commissioner T N Seshan, who died on November 10.</p>
      <p>The condolence meeting was held at Symbiosis Vishwabhavan, Senapati Bapat Road. Madhav Godbole, former home secretary, Government of India, presided over the meet.</p>
      <p>Godbole said Seshan was an icon of honesty and integrity. “He was a tough person to deal with. He redefined the status and visibility of the Election Commission of India. He identified more than 100 electoral malpractices and reformed the election process. Our nation needs more people like T N Seshan,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dr S B Mujumdar, founder and president of Symbiosis, and Dr Vishwanath Karad, founder and director general, MAEER’s MIT, said how emotionally attached Seshan was to both the institutions and also shared their personal experiences with him.</p>
      <p>Mujumdar said Seshan was like a “jackfruit, who was tough from outside but sweet on the inside”. Karad said Seshan gave “the right direction to our country and there will not be another Seshan”.</p>
