      <h1>Pattinson ineligible for first Test after deciding not to contest code of conduct charge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:21:47+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Cherny</a></address>
      <p>James Pattinson will not fight a charge of using abusive language in a Sheffield Shield match and will be ineligible for selection in the first Test against Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Pattinson has been found guilty of a level two code of conduct breach for personal abuse of an opponent during Victoria's Sheffield Shield loss to Queensland last week.</p>
      <p>In a statement Cricket Australia said Pattinson admitted to the breach, which was reported by umpires John Ward and Shawn Craig to match referee David Talalla. Pattinson apologised immediately and unreservedly to the opponent and the umpires and did not contest the charge, the CA statement said.</p>

      <p>It was the fast bowler's third code of conduct breach in 18 months and the two suspension points he received left him banned for the first Test starting at the Gabba on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake in the heat of the moment," Pattinson said. "Straight away I realised I was in the wrong, and I apologised immediately, both to the opponent and to the umpires.</p>
      <p>"I have done the wrong thing and accept the penalty. I'm gutted to miss a Test match, but the standards are there for a reason and the fault is mine."</p>
      <p>Pattinson wasn't expecting to play the first Test at the Gabba anyway, and had said last Thursday that he expected Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood to take the three frontline quick spots in the XI for the first Test.</p>
      <p>CA head of integrity and security Sean Carroll said: "We have a duty to uphold the highest standards of behaviour and the action taken in this matter demonstrates that. On this occasion, James acknowledges he fell short of that expectation."</p>
      <p>Pattinson has a reputation for being a fiery customer on the field. He was seen talking to a match official in the bowels of the MCG after day two of the match, a day in which he was visibly aggrieved at several decisions that went against him. Umpire Ward was a central figure in most of the incidents.</p>
      <p>Pattinson's situation follows a fine dished out to Steve Smith last week for showing dissent towards umpires during NSW's Shield match against Western Australia.</p>
