      <p>The Bruins said the team would be donating in honor of Worcester firefighter Lt. Jason Menard, who died while fighting a house fire on Wednesday and saving two members of his crew from the burning home, Boston 25 News <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/bruins-to-donate-5050-raffle-proceeds-to-fallen-worcester-firefighter-s-family/1009265395">reported</a>.</p>

      <p>Menard was slated to leave for a trip to Disney with his wife and three children later in the day.</p>
      <p>The fundraiser comes just one day after the New York City-based “Tunnel-to-Towers Foundation” — which was formed after the September 11, 2001, attacks — announced that it would pay the first $100,000 of the Menard family’s mortgage.</p>
      <p>The Boston Bruins Foundation 50/50 raffle is still <a href="https://www.nhl.com/bruins/community/foundation-raffles-auctions">accepting</a> donations. However, purchasers of tickets must be present in the state of Massachusetts at the time the ticket is sold.</p>
      <p>The Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts Foundation is also <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/memorial-fund-established-for-fallen-worcester-fire-lt-jason-menard/1008611586">accepting</a> donations on Menard’s behalf, and 100 percent of those donations will go directly to Menard’s family.</p>
