      <h1>Colin Kaepernick Tells NFL Owners To Stop Being Scared</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:44:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick was scheduled to work out for NFL scouts at the Atlanta Falcons facility. ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter revealed the <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/colin-kaepernick-workout-being-moved-location">location of his workout changed last minute</a>.</p>
      <p>However, that didn’t stop the workout.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick and his team re-located the workout to a local Georgia high school instead. Once there, he warmed up, threw to receivers and met with a few scouts after the workout.</p>
      <p>According to Carolina Panthers reporter Jourdan Rodrigue, Kaepernick spoke with scouts from the Washington Redskins, New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs after the workout was complete.</p>
      <p>He told those scouts to sent a message to their team’s respective owner.</p>
      <p>“When you go back, tell your owners to stop being scared,” Kaepernick said.</p>

      <p>The former star quarterback hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, though not for lack of trying. More than 25 NFL teams were reportedly planning to attend the workout – though that was before the location change.</p>
      <p>At least three teams attended, as mentioned earlier in the post.</p>
      <p>Adam Schefter revealed another <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195848237112016903">statement from the quarterback</a>. “I’ve been ready. I’m staying ready. And I’ll continue to be ready….The ball’s in their court. We’re ready to go,” Kaepernick said.</p>
      <p>Will anyone sign him?</p>
