      <h1>Armed men invade INEC office in Kogi community, chase officials, observers into hiding - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:12:59+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:12</time> by <a rel="author">Azeezat Adedigba and Oge Udegbunam</a></address>
      <p>The atmosphere was tense Saturday night at about 10 p.m. in Ugwolawo community, Ofu local government of Kogi State, as thugs who claimed to be from Zamfara State invaded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office.</p>
      <p>Collation of results was ongoing when the armed men arrived.</p>
      <p>For more than an hour, the armed men shot sporadically into the air and are believed to have engaged a police team that arrived later in a shootout.</p>
      <p>When they shot sporadically, they shouted on top of their voice for residents of the area to remain indoors and not come out to continue the collation exercise at the INEC office.</p>
      <p>Our reporter, among other observers who were caught up in the fracas, had to run into a house and lie down for over an hour.</p>
      <p>Residents and election observers were still in hiding at the time of this report.</p>
      <p>Efforts to contact the INEC spokesperson and the police spokesperson in Kogi State were unsuccessful as both did not respond to calls and text messages.</p>
      <p>Premium Times earlier reported how thugs allegedly loyal to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) invaded Dekina community in Dekina local government of Kogi State in an attempt to hijack results sheets for the Dekina Ward.</p>
      <p>The PDP collation agent for the ward, Obaka James, said the results were already collated and being signed by agents, when gunshot sounds rented the air.</p>
      <p>Mr Obaka said; “We know the attackers, they had already operated in the morning and their leader was arrested. But we don’t know how he was released again. Now you can see the problems he is causing. But they don’t know that I have collated result with me.”</p>
      <p>He said across eight other local governments in the senatorial districts, collation had been done in most wards.”So, why is ours different? Every time, there must be crisis claiming lives in this place. Is election war?”</p>
      <p>Earlier, at about 1:13 a.m. on Saturday, thugs had invaded the registration centre for ward 2 in the local government, which is located at Odu Ofomu community and attacked the electoral officers.</p>
