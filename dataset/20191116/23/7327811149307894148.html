      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- Authorities say an off-duty police officer was killed and two other people were injured when their car crashed on the FDR Drive Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>It happened around 3 a.m. on the FDR near 23rd Street.</p>
      <p>Police say the driver of a black Lexus sedan was going at a high rate of speed when he lost control, and the vehicle slammed into a divider and overturned.</p>
      <p>The driver, Officer Garman Chen, 25, was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital. Officer Chen was a three-year veteran of the department.</p>
      <p>A 25-year-old male passenger and a 25-year-old female passenger were both ejected from the car. The woman sustained a severed right foot.</p>
      <p>Both passengers are listed in serious but stable condition. The male passenger is a member of the FDNY.</p>
      <p>The Lexus was owned by Chen - family says he was likely on his way home from a night out.</p>
      <p>Distraught friends and neighbors in the Kensington section of Brooklyn where Chen grew up are still in shock. They say he loved being a police officer and had aspirations of making Detective.</p>
      <p>Police shut down the FDR in both directions for several hours following the accident but all lanes have since reopened.</p>
      <p>The cause of the crash is under investigation. Police are looking into whether speed or other factors played a role in the crash.</p>
