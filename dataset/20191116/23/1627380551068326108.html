      <h1>India register Test triumph inside three days</h1>
      <h2>A clinical performance from Virat Kohli's side to claim an easy victory by an innings and 130 runs</h2>

      <p>Mohammed Shami took four wickets as India crushed Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs inside three days of the first Test on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh were bowled out for 213 in the final session in Indore after their gamble to bat first after winning the toss backfired badly against the Indian pace attack.</p>
      <p>Shami's fellow fast bowlers Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma shared three wickets between them after India declared their first innings on 6-493, with a lead of 343 runs.</p>
      <p>"The captain gave me the freedom to bowl the way I wanted and it went well," Shami said after the game. "Having Umesh and Ishant alongside me is a plus."</p>

      <p>Bangladesh batsman Mushfiqur Rahim offered some resistance, hitting 64 after Rohit Sharma dropped him on four off Shami.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur, who scored 43 in Bangladesh's 150 in the first innings, finally became one of three wickets taken by off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin.</p>
      <p>Ashwin, who reached 250 wickets in home Tests in the first innings, got last man Ebadat Hossain for one to spark India's victory celebrations.</p>
      <p>India were dominant with the bat and ball against Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>Opening batsman Mayank Agarwal played a key part in the win with his 243 - his second double century in four Tests - as India amassed 407 runs on the second day.</p>
      <p>The bowlers kept up the pressure when Bangladesh started their second innings.</p>
      <p>Yadav drew first blood, taking Imrul Kayes for six on a ball that curved into the left-hander and rattled the leg stump.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma got Shadman Islam for six in the next over. Shami then trapped skipper Mominul Haque lbw for seven.</p>
      <p>Mominul was given not out by the on-field umpire but India skipper Virat Kohli successfully reviewed the decision with replays showing the ball would have hit leg stump.</p>
      <p>Shami, who also took three wickets in the first innings, took Mohammad Mithun for 18.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh skipper Mominul said the batting of Mushfiqur and bowling of Abu Jayed had been the only positives in the disappointing defeat.</p>
      <p>Abu Jayed stood out with his four wickets in the Indian innings but got little support from his teammates.</p>
      <p>The second and final match is a day-night clash, with India hosting their first-ever pink-ball Test at Kolkata's Eden Gardens from November 22</p>
