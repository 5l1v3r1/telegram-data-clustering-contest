      <p>Kenny Stafford’s role in Sunday’s West Division final remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders could ask Stafford to fill in for<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/shaq-evans-surpasses-1000-receiving-yards-for-the-saskatchewan-roughriders"> Shaq Evans</a>, the team’s leading receiver, who remains a game-time decision with a foot injury as Sunday’s matchup with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers looms.</p>
      <p>If Evans is available, Stafford would likely be relegated to bench duty.</p>
      <p>“If I don’t get the call, I will be the best teammate I can be,” <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders-kenny-stafford-keeps-smiling-despite-lack-of-playing-time">said Stafford, who has yet to dress for a regular-season game with the Riders since being acquired from the Edmonton Eskimos on Aug. 5.</a></p>
      <p>“I will be getting the fans loud. Whatever the players see, I will talk to the coaches and translate it to them.”</p>
      <p>Stafford, a veteran of seven CFL seasons, has approached preparations with the mindset of a starter.</p>
      <p>“You’re always prepared to play so you don’t have to get ready when you need to be ready,” he said.</p>
