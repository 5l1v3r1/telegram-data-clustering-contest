      <h1>Arsenal: Dani Ceballos has a lot to say about the state of the club</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal don’t have a lot of positivity going about the club, but if Dani Ceballo really does want to stay, it says a lot about the club, and none of it is negative.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T23:59:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>I’ve been pretty critical of <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/c0617e2b/Dani-Ceballos?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Dani Ceballos</a> recently, mostly because I, like many <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> fans, were spoiled by his early performances. And while I accept that acclimation is necessary for all players, it’s a bit harder when you’re on loan, trying to impress both sides of your spectrum, the club you’re currently at and the club you want to return to.</p>
      <p>That said, Ceballos is a player of many talents, who was liked enough by Real Madrid to be brought up and given a chance. And there was a certain degree of a ‘let’s win him over so he will stay’ mentality from the moment he arrived.</p>
      <p>Even now, as I preach about us having to want him just as much as he wants us, with how much chaos there is bantering about the club, knowing that Dani Ceballos would still want to stay is a huge testament to Unai Emery and the state of the club.</p>
      <p>According to recent reports, Ceballos does want to stay. Now, whether we believe those rumors or not is another matter, but assuming he does want to stay, that’s a big deal. Forget what we end up doing with him, the fact that he wants to stay is all we need to know to establish some hope.</p>
      <p>Being so new to the club, and having so much that hasn’t gone right, both on his own individual level and for the team as a whole, there is plenty of room for Ceballos to say, “get me the hell out of here, I hate it.”</p>
      <p>He hasn’t done that.</p>
      <p>If he does want to stay, it indicates that he sees a future here for him. A future that involves proper development, opportunity and tactics. And with what <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/dd0daf32/Henrikh-Mkhitaryan?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> said recently, having a voice on the other side, even an assumed voice, is an uplifting thing.</p>
      <p>It also means that he has faith in the developmental process at the club, which is perhaps the one aspect that hasn’t gone so horribly awry. Unai Emery has been very generous with utilizing his young players.</p>
      <p>Obviously we’d rather hear it from Dani Ceballos himself, but whatever the case, his opinion does matter, perhaps more than most of the voices at the club.</p>
