      <p>A man fatally shot his wife and three kids in San Diego on Saturday morning and then killed himself, authorities said. </p>
      <p>A 31-year-old man, a 29-year-old woman and a three year old boy were pronounced dead at the scene, San Diego Police Department Lt. Matt Dobbs told reporters.  He added that boys aged 5, 9 and 11 were taken to the hospital, where two of them have also died. The surviving child was undergoing emergency surgery.  Dobbs said that the incident appeared to be a "domestic violence murder-suicide" and that the woman had sought a restraining order on Friday. "We believe the male came over this morning, there was some kind of argument or disagreement, and he used a handgun and shot his family before turning the gun on himself," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sandiegopolicedepartment/videos/546805376118730/">Dobbs said</a>.  He also said police were dispatched after receiving a 9-1-1 call at 6:49 a.m.  "When the officers arrived on-scene, they were able to look through one of the windows and see a small child inside, covered in blood," Dobbs said.  They forced entry into the residence and found the other five people, he added.  San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said that the incident only involved one family and that police were not looking for a suspect.  "As a husband and a father, this incident is very difficult to even think about,” he said. Police did not disclose the names of the people involved in the incident. </p>
