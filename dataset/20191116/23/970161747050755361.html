      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">…Get Me Out Of Here!</a> contestant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> has vowed to do his godfather the late, great <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/george-michael/">George Michael</a>, proud with his stint on the show.</p>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ had close ties to the Careless Whisper singer as mum Shirley was a backing singer for Wham! and part of the duo Pepsi and Shirley in the 80s.</p>
      <p>The 26 year-old has kept tight-lipped about the pop icon since his tragic death in 2016, but before heading into the jungle he did open up about their relationship.</p>
      <p>‘The only memories I have of George [are] amazing,’ he shared. ‘His legacy and everything he left behind is amazing.</p>
      <p>‘I was very fortunate with an amazing childhood and very privileged and I’m super pleased to have known him as closely as I did.’</p>
      <p>When asked if he would be open to discussing the Faith hitmaker during his stint on the jungle, Roman didn’t rule anything out.</p>

      <p>‘I think doing my job and doing radio, you’re constantly vulnerable,’ he continued. ‘And I’m a very open person, so there’s not any topics that I won’t really talk about in there.’</p>

      <p>And there will certainly be plenty of things Roman can discuss with his fellow campmates.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/im-celebrity-2019-start-line-11089656/">He’s going to be joining a star-studded line-up</a> including reality TV legend Caitlyn Jenner, pop siren Nadine Coyle and ex-footballer Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>One contestant, Rak-Su’s Myles Stephenson, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebritys-myles-stephenson-to-grill-caitlin-jenner-over-oj-simpson-murder-trial-11162233/">has already vowed to grill Caitlyn over the infamous OJ Simpson trial</a>.</p>
      <p>The pictures come after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebrity-bosses-confirm-live-bugs-wont-be-eaten-in-bush-tucker-trials-11168266/">ITV confirmed that live insects will no longer be used on any eating trials</a> in the programme.</p>
      <p>It was claimed<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebrity-bosses-ban-live-insects-from-bushtucker-trials-after-animal-rights-backlash-11165998/"> that no celebs would be chowing down on any critters that were still crawling</a> during the famous eating trials.</p>
      <p>And bosses have now announced the change has been implemented and it will be permanent.</p>
