      <h1>Vontaze Burfict Destroys Roger Goodell In Crazy Interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:37:12+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive lineman Myles Garrett isn’t the only notable NFL player suspended for the remainder of the season. Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict has been suspended for the season since Week 4.</p>
      <p>Unlike Garrett, who’s currently on an apology tour, Burfict isn’t being safe with his words.</p>
      <p>The Oakland Raiders linebacker blasted NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in an interview with The Athletic.</p>
      <p>“I met Roger Goodell in New York and he was a total b—h,” Burfict said. “He was a b—h. He didn’t let anybody speak, he rushed us in and out of the meeting. The meeting was bullshit.”</p>
      <p>Burfict said he agreed with the NFL’s decision to suspend Garrett, because it wasn’t a football act. His plays, meanwhile, were.</p>
      <p>“The NFL had to suspend somebody for that last night, since that wasn’t a football act,” Burfict <a href="https://theathletic.com/1382826/2019/11/15/exclusive-exiled-raiders-linebacker-vontaze-burfict-weighs-in-on-myles-garrett-and-blasts-the-nfl/">told The Athletic</a>. “My suspension was a football act. I was hitting somebody. I wasn’t taking a helmet off and swinging it at somebody.”</p>
      <p>Burfict has been suspended since Week 4 for a series of hits that were deemed dirty by the league.</p>

      <p>Burfict was on a one-year contract with Oakland. He says he wants to play next year.</p>
      <p>However, his new comments about the commissioner of the league could affect that.</p>
