      <p>Besiktas have been linked with a move for out-of-favour Aston Villa striker Jonathan Kodjia.</p>
      <p>The forward has seen his game-time limited upon <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> 's return to the Premier League, the 30-year-old playing just 20 minutes of League football this season.</p>
      <p>He's spent most of 2019-20 out injured with a cheekbone problem, but he returned to full fitness last month and managed just four minutes in two games.</p>
      <p>Kodjia <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-rejected-late-transfer-17009713">was linked with a move to Qatari side Al-Gharafa</a> before the transfer window shut for Qatar Stars League clubs.</p>
