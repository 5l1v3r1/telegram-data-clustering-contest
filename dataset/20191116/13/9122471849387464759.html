      <h1>Nick Saban Has Suspended An Alabama Player For Skipping Class</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:28:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama will look to get back in the win column against Mississippi State this afternoon. The Crimson Tide are coming off a rare home loss to LSU.</p>
      <p>Nick Saban’s team will be without one of its players in today’s SEC showdown.</p>
      <p>Alabama’s head coach revealed this week that he’s had to suspend one of the Crimson Tide’s players for skipping class.</p>
      <p>“I’ve said this before, when you look at a Christmas tree, all the lights shine bright,” <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Alabama-Crimson-Tide-player-suspended-for-not-going-to-class-Nick-Saban-Tua-Tagovailoa-injury-stats-game-time-decision-Mississippi-State-Bulldogs-138628057/">Saban said, per 247Sports</a>. “But if one light bulb is going like this, that’s all you look at, aight. Well, when you have guys on the team that don’t do what they’re supposed to do — I don’t care if it’s not go to class. I don’t care what it is, that’s a blinking light, and it’s a distraction and it’s a distraction for the players at practice.</p>
      <p>“Like again this week, I’m going to suspend another player for the game because they’re not going to class, aight. I mean, that’s a distraction to everybody. Now, that guy’s not here, so somebody else is in his place. You’ve got to be able to depend on the guy beside you. Why do you not quit? Do you not quit because of you? Or do you not quit because of the people around you that you love and care about? I think a lot of the time when you’re a part of the team, you don’t quit because of those guys. You don’t want to let those people down.”</p>
      <p>Alabama is still in contention for the College Football Playoff. The Crimson Tide need to win out and maybe get some help. They also have to avoid any distractions.</p>
      <p>“But you can’t have that,” Saban added. “If we’re going to have a successful team, you can’t have blinking lights. I don’t care if it’s in the game, off the field, whatever it is. And we had too many in the game last week, and I don’t want to have any off the field. So, we’re going to coach the guys that’ll do the things the way we want them done, and the other guys are just going to have to be out of luck.”</p>
      <p>Alabama and Mississippi State are set to kick off at noon E.T. The game will be on ESPN.</p>
