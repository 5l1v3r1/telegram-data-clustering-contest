      <h1>NFL Week 11 upset picks: Underdogs with good odds to beat the spread</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:42:57+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author">Sportsbook Review</a></address>
      <p>Last week was a bad week for Survivor Pool participants and those playing moderate to good-sized favorites.</p>
      <p>New Orleans and Indianapolis were double-digit faves who were wiped out and lost outright. While San Francisco and Kansas City were major disappointments for their fan bases and backers.</p>
      <p>What should we be looking at this week for <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/nfl/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20picks">NFL picks</a>? Let's examine two hot underdog money-makers and Super Bowl team from a year that has lost its luster.</p>

      <h3>Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Sunday, Nov. 17, 1 p.m. ET (CBS)  at Hard Rock Stadium</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Opening odds:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/3778719/odds/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article">Bills -7</a></p>
      <p>Hard to guess the mode of the Miami front office right now. They tried to trade talented players for draft picks to build for the future, fully intending to lose a great deal this year. The plan was working to perfection, then, it started falling apart.</p>
      <p>The Dolphins began winning, not once but two weeks in a row. This places the Fins two-games behind Cincinnati for the No.1 draft choice next year. But here is the deal, first-year Brian Flores was not brought in to lose 16 games, his job was to squeeze the most amount from available talent and effort out of a limited roster. His thinking is to still be the head coach in say three years when Miami could be back in playoff contention and Tom Brady is just four years away from retirement.</p>
      <p>Those working the <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">NFL odds</a> are already on board, dropping Miami from +7 to +5.5 just days after the line was released. The Dolphins have covered five in a row and Buffalo's offense on the road is averaging a mere 18.7 points (26th overall), generating a potential Fins cover spot at the very least.</p>
      <p><b>NFL pick:</b> Dolphins +5.5 (-110)</p>
      <h3>Arizona Cardinals vs. San Francisco 49ers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Sunday, Nov. 17, 4:05 p.m. ET (FOX) at Levi's Stadium</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Opening odds:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/3778711/odds/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article">49ers -14</a></p>
      <p>The last undefeated team, San Francisco, played nervous and uncertain of itself in an overtime loss to Seattle at home. Jimmy Garoppolo lacked confidence and when he was on target, his receivers let him down too often with drops.</p>
      <p>The strength of the 49ers defense is it's front four and while they are still collecting sacks, they have surrendered 143.3 yards per game on the ground in their last three outings.<br/>Some might expect San Fran to nicely rebound against Arizona at home this week and they should but what about that pesky 13.5-point spread?</p>
      <p>The Cardinals have lost three in a row, yet are on a 5-1 ATS, all as underdogs. Similar to Flores of Miami, Arizona's Kliff Kingsbury has his team giving great effort which can overcome talent deficiencies, at least to beat spreads.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Kyler Murray still makes rookie mistakes, but they are from being aggressive, not passive.</p>
      <p>With the Niners having Green Bay, at Baltimore and at New Orleans on tap, a victory and non-cover for San Francisco makes perfect sense.</p>
      <p><b>NFL pick:</b> Cardinals +13.5 (-110)</p>
      <h3>Chicago Bears vs. Los Angeles Rams</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Sunday, Nov. 17, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC) at L.A. Memorial Coliseum</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Opening odds:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/3778712/odds/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=article">Rams -7.5</a></p>
      <p>If this contest isn't the perfect example of how swiftly things change in the NFL, we don't what is. Outside of New Orleans, Chicago and the Los Angeles Rams were the best bets to play for the NFC title this season.</p>
      <p>Though each team could get hot and make a playoff run with seven games to go, neither will enter as division champions.</p>
      <p>For all the negative talk about Mitchell Trubisky, just this week nationally, the Rams Jared Goff is drawing attention he doesn't want. After playing behind a Top 5 offensive line the last two years, the Rams made changes upfront to fix salary cap and they are paying the price.</p>
      <p>The Patriots in the Super Bowl showed how you slow the Rams offense down and others have employed similar tactics. An already average O-Line is weaker after last Sunday with two injuries and receiver Brandon Cook will miss another game because of concussion.</p>
      <p>The Chicago Bears are from perfect, ending a five-game losing streak at home against Detroit's backup QB. Nonetheless, favorites of 3.5 to 10 points like L.A., after going under the total by 35 or more points total in their last five games, a marginal winning team (51% to 60%) playing a losing team are 8-28 ATS in next contest.</p>
      <p><b>NFL pick:</b> Bears +6.5 (-110)</p>
