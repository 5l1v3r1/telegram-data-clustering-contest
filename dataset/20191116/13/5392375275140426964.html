      <p>Dark Mode on WhatsApp is closer than ever!<br/>4 (80%) 68 votes</p>
      <p>Dark Mode for WhatsApp has got many talks lately, however, we are still waiting for the implementation of the feature for the application.</p>
      <p>Now, the latest update in Beta for Android and iOS promises the implementation of the feature. The app starts to show signs of Dark Mode if you have turned it on your smartphone.</p>
      <p>That is, the beta already reacts according to your smartphone. If you have Dark Mode enabled, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> will implement Dark Mode in the application.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/">WABetaInfo,</a> for now, the implementation is not complete. We have Dark Mode on the “Splash Screen” when you open the App, and in the conversations. The wallpaper will change from white to dark.</p>

      <h3>Dark Mode on WhatsApp: Not yet everywhere</h3>
      <p>However, these are the main changes. In Calls and Settings, the app is still white as we are used to. Still, this new implementation is favorable evidence for the implementation of dark mode in the application.</p>

      <p>Recall that after rebranding the Facebook Logo, WhatsApp has redesigned the Splash Screen, adding references to Facebook. The same logo has been implemented in WhatsApp Settings, redesigning the old footer.</p>
      <p>It is worth to mention that just like messenger and other apps, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/01/whatsapp-for-android-can-now-be-unlocked-with-a-fingerprint/">WhatsApp has recently received the ability to be secured with the fingerprint</a> (WhatsApp version 2.19.308). Among other things, users can set how fast they want the fingerprint request to activate. It can be immediately after the display closes, 1 minute or even 20 minutes.</p>
