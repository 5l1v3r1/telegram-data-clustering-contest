      <h1>The Batman Is Following a Familiar Film Pattern - But Is This a Mistake?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:11:06+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Willshire</a></address>
      <p>Director Matt Reeves' upcoming Batman film seems to have no shortage of villains. With the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-batman-casts-big-little-lies-star-as-catwoman/">recent confirmation that <i>Big Little Lies</i><i> </i>star, Zoe Kravitz, will be playing Catwoman</a>, to the even more recent report that Colin Farrell will play the Penguin, it seems Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne will have his hands full when <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-batman/">The Batman</a> </i>is released in 2021.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time that Batman has faced off against multiple antagonists, though. One of the most exciting prospects of a new Batman film is the fact that his corner of the DC universe features one of the most robust rogues galleries in comics. However, to some, the possibility that this upcoming Batman <a href="https://www.cbr.com/batman-movie-matt-reeves-four-villains/">could be up against four or more villains</a> is cause for concern. While most Batman films are critical and financial successes, many have also drawn criticism for fixating too much on the villains: either featuring too many or focusing more on them than the title character.</p>

      <p>In addition to Catwoman and Penguin, it appears <i>The Batman</i> will also feature the Riddler, and there are even reports that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/report-succession-star-passed-on-the-batmans-two-face/">Matt Reeves is looking to cast an actor as Two-Face</a>. <i>The Batman</i> could be reintroducing audiences to <a href="https://screenrant.com/batman-movie-cast-characters-story-reveals/">at least four big-name villains</a> as well as a brand-new Batman all at once. Is Reeves at risk of repeating past film mistakes by including too many antagonists? Or are these concerns misplaced?</p>
      <h3>Batman Rarely Has Just One Enemy</h3>

      <p>Fans will often point to the failings of Joel Schumacher's <i>Batman Forever </i>and <i>Batman &amp; Robin </i>as evidence that too many villains ruin a movie. However, what is much less often pointed out is that apart from Tim Burton's <i>Batman</i> in 1989, which only featured the Joker, every other solo Batman film since has included at the very least one secondary antagonist.</p>
      <p><i>Batman Returns</i> included the Penguin, Catwoman, and Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, who was created specifically for that film. The previously mentioned <i>Batman Forever </i>and <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> featured multiple main antagonists. Two-Face and the Riddler in the former and Poison Ivy, Bane, and Mister Freeze in the latter. Christopher Nolan's critically acclaimed trilogy maintained this tradition as well. <i>Batman Begins</i> included Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul. <i>The Dark Knight</i>, often considered to be one of the best comic book films ever made, included a prominent role for Two-Face in addition to Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning turn as the Joker. That film also featured a cameo from Scarecrow, who appeared once again in <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>. While it may be the most divisive of Nolan's, the final film in the trilogy received largely favorable reviews despite including Catwoman, Bane, and Talia al Ghul. So while fans are right in pointing out that the worst Batman films feature more than one villain, the same could be said about the best.</p>
      <h3>It's Not the Number of Villains, It's How They're Used</h3>

      <p>It can be hard to argue that having three or more main antagonists is a good idea. The best reviewed Batman films typically had a clearly defined lead villain while any others were relegated to supporting roles. In <i>The Dark Knight</i>, the Joker serves that lead role, while Two-Face only becomes an antagonistic force in the third-act, spurred on by the actions of the Joker. This keeps the storytelling tight and concise, while still allowing for multiple villains.</p>

      <p>Problems typically arise when there is no clear foil to the hero. <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> suffers from the fact that Poison Ivy and Bane are both villains with disconnected origins and motivations. This isn't unique to Batman films either. Sam Raimi's <i>Spider-Man 3</i> is often criticized for this same issue as well. In that film, Harry Osborn, Sandman, and Venom all have a valid claim to the title of the main antagonist. In contrast, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/every-spider-man-villain-spider-verse/"><i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> had six villains</a>, but Wilson Fisk was clearly developed as the primary threat, allowing the other five to play a range of supporting roles.</p>
      <p>It's also worth bringing up that <i>Batman</i> ('89) still received criticism for its villain, despite being the one Batman film that doesn't feature multiple. While Jack Nicholson's Joker is generally liked by fans and critics, his role largely overshadows Michael Keaton's in the film as Bruce Wayne. Tim Burton elected to focus on Joker's backstory rather than Batman's, and he also has comparable screen time to the title character.</p>
      <p>So while <i>The Batman</i> may have a crowded cast, it is too early to tell what this will mean for the quality of the film. Penguin, Riddler, Two-Face, and Catwoman could all be lead antagonists, but they could all just as easily play supporting roles or cameos. Perhaps with the intention to bring any one of them back for a sequel.</p>
      <p>Starring Robert Pattinson, <i>The Batman</i> is directed by Matt Reeves, who will also produce alongside Dylan Clark. While casting is still underway, the film is scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021.</p>
