      <h1>3D simulation of a 'fire near me' gives residents a wake-up call</h1>

      <p>Residents on Sydney's upper north shore were shocked this week to see how quickly a bushfire in North Turramurra blazed through a high school and hospital, with high winds carrying embers 12 kilometres away and starting spot fires at random.</p>
      <p>If this fire had been real, it would have been too late for many residents. Luckily, it wasn't.</p>

      <p>Unlike the real fire that broke out in Lane Cove National Park in South Turramurra on Tuesday, Wednesday's blaze was virtual. To shock residents into developing a bushfire survival plan, the virtual blaze simulated similar but slightly windier conditions, equal to 90km/h, to Tuesday's conditions.</p>
      <p>The simulation was part of a workshop run by Ku-ring-gai Council's <a href="https://climatewisecommunities.com.au/about/">Climate Wise Communities</a> program, powered by 3D interactive software, developed by the US military, called Simtable.</p>
      <p>In the simulation, a 3D map is projected onto a contoured box, filled with fine walnut husks that are shaped to match the topographical lines of a map.</p>
      <p>Residents at the workshop planted flags on properties to see what would happen if a bushfire had ripped up the hills.</p>

      <p>"That's the scale of event we want you to plan for. This is how fast and unpredictable it can be," Jennifer Scott, leader of the council's sustainability program, said.</p>
      <p>To meet demand after Tuesday's fires, the council added extra sessions. The workshop encourages residents to take responsibility for their properties and their own safety in extreme weather events.</p>

      <p>The council's Climate Wise website averages 100 users a month. On Tuesday, 1300 new users enrolled.</p>
      <p>Before showing how a fire would affect North Turramurra, the workshop started with a recreation of Northern California's deadliest and most destructive fire. Known as the Camp Fire, it killed 86 civilians last year.</p>
      <p>"When we bring in people who have done nothing, they are worried," Dr Scott said. "They don't realise it can happen that fast."</p>
      <p>When people see the simulation, and get involved, they start to believe it can happen to them. It wasn't just something that happened to others.</p>
      <p>The program is run with fire and rescue services, who provide feedback to residents on their bushfire survival plans.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the virtual blaze that could have trapped North Turramurra residents, Ku-ring-gai Rural Fire Service Brigade Captain Nic Lyons said this "sort of thing happens on a bad day".</p>
      <p>"You can't predict exactly what's going to happen, but this is a really good way of showing how fires behave."</p>
      <p>Until Tuesday's fire struck South Turramurra, workshop attendee Sandy Lamb was sceptical that his eucalypt-filled property in Pymble, five kilometres away, was really at risk.</p>
      <p>"It was a wake-up call," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Lamb lives across from a reserve with a lot of debris and tall trees. "It would be a simple act of fire hazardry to jump the road and end up in my trees," he said.</p>
      <p>After the simulations, Mr Lamb worked with a volunteer from RFS to develop a survival plan. He was advised to download the RFS' Fires Near Me app, and add an alert for fires within 10 kilometres of his home.</p>
      <p>"If I had any recommendation to anyone living in Sydney in a bushy region, it would be to get the app," he said.</p>
      <p>The simulation was excellent, too. "It really brings it home," he said.</p>
      <p>Ku-ring-gai is the only council with the 3D interactive simulation platform. It was funded by a $48,000 grant from Local Government NSW with an additional $20,000 in council funding.</p>
