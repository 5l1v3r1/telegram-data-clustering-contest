      <h1>Oklahoma vs. Baylor prediction, line: Sooners will cover big number</h1>

      <p>Many realistic possibilities remain for the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>There could be two SEC teams (LSU, plus either Georgia or Alabama). There could be two Big Ten teams (Ohio State, plus either Minnesota or Penn State). The Pac-12 has two opportunities (Oregon, Utah) to crack the field for the first time in three years.</p>
      <p>And the Big 12 is not as buried as it seems.</p>
      <p>I rarely put much stock in whatever rankings just came out — every year this damn four-team farce remains, I will remind you TCU was ranked third in the penultimate 2014 rankings, then dropped to sixth after a 52-point win — and the placement of No. 10 Oklahoma (8-1, but behind five other one-loss teams) and No. 13 Baylor (9-0, but behind a pair of two-loss teams) isn’t a death sentence.</p>
      <p>Baylor would get in with an undefeated record. Should the Sooners win out, the three-time playoff participant, featuring Heisman Trophy contender Jalen Hurts and the nation’s top-ranked offense could present a powerful argument with a strong finish, as long as the top three (LSU, Ohio State, Clemson) remain perfect.</p>
      <p>Following so many struggles against inferior competition, the Bears look more likely to lose at least half of their next four games — three probably against a combination of Oklahoma and Texas — than to remain undefeated.</p>
      <p>Last week, previously maligned Minnesota made its case as a contender with a win over Penn State. This week, the perception of Baylor becomes reality against <b>Oklahoma (-10)</b>, once again, the Big 12’s only chance at a playoff spot.</p>
      <p><b>MISSOURI TIGERS (+7) over Florida Gators:</b> Fading the public in college football this season hasn’t been as profitable as it has been historically, but let’s get back to our roots with this curiously low line and the return of Tigers QB Kelly Bryant.</p>
      <p><b>MISSISSIPPI STATE BULLDOGS (+18) over Alabama Crimson Tide:</b> Unlike when Tua Tagovailoa was a lock to play against LSU despite recent surgery on his ankle, this week’s game-time decision could easily result in the Heisman runner-up resting against a risk-free opponent.</p>
      <p><b>NEBRASKA CORNHUSKERS (+14½) over Wisconsin Badgers:</b> Dating to 1962, Memorial Stadium has a 373-game sellout streak. Dating to mid-September, the Cornhuskers have lost six straight games against the spread. The former will outlive us. The latter is due to end.</p>

      <p><b>MICHIGAN WOLVERINES (-13½) over Michigan State Spartans:</b> Michigan State has won both games at Ann Arbor since Jim Harbaugh’s arrival as Wolverines coach and haven’t lost to their rival by more than two touchdowns since Mark Dantonio took over in 2007 as their coach. But Michigan State might as well be Morgan State right now, having lost four straight games with the nation’s 95th-ranked offense.</p>
      <p><b>PENN STATE NITTANY LIONS (-14½) over Indiana Hoosiers:</b> I made the mistake of undervaluing Minnesota because the Golden Gophers had built an undefeated record against such terrible opposition. I’ll take that chance again with the Hoosiers, who are ranked for the first time in 25 years, but have run up a 7-2 record against teams with a combined record of 17-39. Indiana’s one game against a winning team was a 41-point home loss to Ohio State.</p>
      <p><b>NOTRE DAME FIGHTING IRISH (-7) over Navy Midshipmen:</b> The money has come pouring in on the Midshipmen — the line opened at -11 — but Navy hasn’t won in South Bend in a decade. An improved Navy defense has failed its two biggest tests — allowing 73 combined points to Tulane and Memphis — and the Fighting Irish’s superior talent and familiarity with the triple-option will limit the nation’s top-ranked rushing attack.</p>
      <p><b>Ohio State Buckeyes (-52½) over RUTGERS SCARLET KNIGHTS:</b> The best team in the country unexpectedly lost the best player in the country (DE Chase Young) and beat Maryland by 59. Now, the Buckeyes face a team Maryland beat by 41. I’m more interested to see if the final margin of victory will be higher than the number of fans who stay for all four quarters.</p>
      <p><b>CLEMSON TIGERS (-34½) over Wake Forest Demon Deacons:</b> Any chance the Demon Deacons had to land a few blows against the nation’s third-ranked defense ended when the ACC’s leading receiver, Sage Surratt, suffered a season-ending injury last weekend.</p>
      <p><b>AUBURN TIGERS (+2¹/₂) over Georgia Bulldogs:</b> Sign me up for any scenario in which Alabama fans have to root for Auburn. I’ll also happily accept the points and the home team — the Tigers’ three matchups against ranked teams all came away from home — in a low-scoring, defensive showdown.</p>
      <p><b>Minnesota Golden Gophers (+3) over IOWA HAWKEYES:</b> Less than a year after the Wright brothers’ first flight, the Gophers opened their season with a win over Twin Cities Central High school and finished undefeated. It took 115 years for Minnesota to go 9-0 again, so there is every right to be skeptical, but it isn’t a fluke. It’s P.J. Fleck.</p>
      <p><b>Lsu Tigers (-21) over MISSISSIPPI REBELS:</b> The Tigers haven’t let down, or let up, yet. If Ole Miss allowed a combined 713 passing yards Auburn’s 90th-ranked attack and California’s 109th-ranked unit, what chance do the Rebels have against Joe Burrow?<br/>Ucla (+21) over UTAH: The Bruins have won three straight and would play for the Pac-12 title by closing out the regular season with three more wins. Crazier things have happened. Actually, maybe not.</p>
      <p><b>Arizona Wildcats (+27) over OREGON DUCKS:</b> The Wildcats are using two quarterbacks and fired their defensive coordinator two weeks ago. Oregon has no idea what’s coming.</p>
      <p><b>Best bets:</b> Penn State, Notre Dame, Minnesota<br/><b>This season (best bets):</b> 79-89-2 (14-19)<br/><b>2014-18 record:</b> 641-612-10</p>
