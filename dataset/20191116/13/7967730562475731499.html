      <h1>Women fighting on the firefront and the homefront</h1>

      <p>Nana Glen's Linda Hill, a single mother with a sick son, had to make some speedy decisions this week, as flames threatened to engulf the north coast hamlet she calls home.</p>

        <figcaption>Linda Hill and son Cooper of Nana Glen were evacuated.</figcaption>

      <p>Should she stay along with eight-year-old daughter Jasmine and six-year-old son Cooper, who after 14 months' fighting leukemia in Sydney Children's Hospital was looking forward to his first day back at school on Monday. Or should they go? Like many of the people forced to evacuate their homes during the fires across NSW this week, she chose to go. She picked up a few precious items, including medical reports for Cooper, and took him and Jasmine to stay with friends in Coffs Harbour.</p>
      <p>"It was a bit squishy," Hill said, as there were already four children and two adults in the three-bedroom home, but it was only a temporary inconvenience.</p>
      <p>After 14 months of living out of a suitcase at Ronald McDonald House in Randwick, where Cooper had numerous operations including a bone marrow transplant and radiation, Hill told her children not to worry about taking toys and possessions. She assured them if their house burnt, people would give them new clothes and toys.</p>

      <p>"For me the house doesn't matter," she said. "We have hardly been there the past 14 months and have been living out of a suitcase in Sydney, but it's the people of Nana Glen I care about. They have all been so supportive."</p>
      <p>When I listened to Hill's words I realised parenting is a lot like leadership; it is more about what you don't say than what you do.</p>
      <p>If only the nation's political leaders – most of them male – could have taken some lessons from this rural woman, who gave up everything: her job and the home she'd bought in 2017 to move to Sydney to fight for her son's life.</p>
      <p>I'm not going to repeat what these men said: Michael McCormack, Barnaby Joyce, John Barilaro, Jordon Steele-John and Richard Di Natale, during this week's devastation in which we lost four lives, 1 million hectares and hundreds of homes. You most likely already know what they said in the heat of the moment, "snug in their Canberra bubbles and air-conned Comm cars," as Sophie Love, a farmer forced to flee from outside of Port Macquarie, told me.</p>

      <p>Instead I want to repeat the wisdom of women like Love and Hill, on the home and firefront.</p>
      <p>The NSW Rural Fire Service is the world's largest volunteer fire service, with 74,162 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering">volunteer</a> members, at last count. Twenty per cent of them were women. None of them, men or women, wanted to be singled out for any acts of heroism. They just got down to fighting bushfires of the real variety, not the Canberra kind.</p>
      <p>Some, such as the 19 injured firefighters, at least one of whom was a woman, also honoured their fire captains, for fast thinking and foot work in the face of flames.</p>
      <p>Others, such as Linda Hill, and the 1055 residents of Nana Glen, including Russell Crowe, just wanted to thank the fireys and rally around those who need help, now they've returned to their saved but smoky homes.</p>
      <p>"It could have been worse," Hill said. "We could have lost everything, like the family in my daughter's class at school who lost their house."</p>

      <p>Resilience. Respect. Reliability. These are the words I think of when I listen to Hill.</p>
      <p>It's perhaps appropriate that last month Leah Purcell started shooting <i>The Drover’s Wife – the Legend of Molly Johnson</i> in NSW. It's time to re-render the image of the Australian woman. Often she is not a wife to someone, like Hill. Or sometimes she is wife to another woman, as in Senator Penny Wong's case.</p>
      <p>Purcell's directing debut for a feature film is <a href="https://www.if.com.au/hollywood-executives-spark-to-leah-purcells-the-drovers-wife/">a re-imagining</a> of her acclaimed play and Henry Lawson’s classic short story. It is long overdue.</p>

      <p>In her version of the age-old story of a woman on the land, the narrative deals with love, family, protection, survival, truth and misogyny. It asks the question: How far would you go to protect the ones you love?</p>
      <p>In Hill's case, it's giving up everything to come to Sydney to fight for her son's life. Quietly, without complaining.</p>
      <p>It's fitting that the fires came in the week of Rememberance Day, as fighting wars and fighting fires are similar in so many ways. The Governor-General's wife, Linda Hurley, said we must insert more women into the Anzac World War I legend. She was referring in particular to the Australian nurses who tended to wounded soldiers on the island of Lemnos, a short sea voyage from Gallipoli.</p>
      <p>So, too, must we pause to include the image of fast-thinking females whose actions in a crisis, like those of firefighters, speak louder than any words.</p>
