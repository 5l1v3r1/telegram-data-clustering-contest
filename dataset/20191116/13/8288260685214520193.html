      <p>Across Birmingham and the Black Country there were two flood alerts in place.</p>
      <p>For residents living near the River Tame, the Environmental Agency said: "River levels are high but steady at the Tamworth river gauge as a result of recent heavy rainfall. Consequently, the risk of flooding remains.</p>
      <p>"Flooding is affecting low-lying land and roads adjacent to the River Tame between Horseley Heath and Castle Vale and the Ford Brook between Walsall and Bescot. We expect river levels to remain high. We are closely monitoring the situation."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Residents and motorists closer to the River Blythe have been advised that river levels remain high but are beginning to fall at the Castle Farm river gauge after recent heavy rainfall.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the risk of flooding remains. Flooding is affecting low-lying land and roads adjacent to the River Blythe between Cheswick Green and Blyth End. River levels are falling, but still pose a flood risk.</p>
