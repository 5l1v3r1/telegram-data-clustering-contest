      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/emmerdale-spoilers-megan-maceys-tragic-exit-storyline-revealed-10529500/">Gaynor Faye</a> has hinted she could be returning to Emmerdale sooner than we think after her sudden exit earlier this year.</p>
      <p>After seven years in the soap, Gaynor’s character Megan Macey said goodbye to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/emmerdales-cast-devastated-lose-michael-praed-frank-death-story-11163033/">Emmerdale in August 2019 as she decided to move away following Frank Clayton’s funeral</a>, after he died in the factory blaze.</p>
      <p>Although, the actress has now hinted to Graham Norton that a return could be on the cards as ‘Emmerdale is around the corner’.</p>
      <p>Gaynor has been cast in Band of Gold, the stage adaptation of Kay Mellor’s multi award-winning ITV series, which she discussed with the Radio 2 host on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However the comedian couldn’t help but ask her about her character returning to the ITV soap.</p>
      <p>‘Leaving Emmerdale, yeah, it’s heart-wrenching,’ she began.</p>

      <p>‘[I left] to do the stage show. I just wanted to do something different. That’s what an actor does, I do different roles.’</p>

      <p>Addressing a potential return to Emmerdale she added: ‘I left in a taxi, so who knows? I didn’t leave, I still see loads of people and Emmerdale’s around the corner, but I’m absolutely loving doing this show.’</p>

      <h3>How did Frank Clayton die in Emmerdale?</h3>
      <p>A devastating fire took hold at the sweet factory, and it put Tracy in danger as she was trapped in the building.</p>
      <p>Frank was able to get his daughter out alive, but he ended up getting caught in an explosion that claimed his life.</p>
      <p>The horrifying blaze was accidentally set by Kerry Wyatt (Laura Norton) and her daughter Amy (Natalie Ann Jamieson).</p>
      <p>Kerry and Amy started the fire right after they raided the safe at the factory – a crime that Kerry had previously claimed would be ‘victimless’.</p>
      <p>However the pair noticed that the robbery was being caught on CCTV, and when they tried to destroy the footage, they carelessly left wires exposed, which sparked and set the building on fire.</p>
