      <h1>Mason Rudolph avoids suspension in Myles Garrett incident, leaving some NFL fans upset</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:45:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p>Mason Rudolph <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-suspension-helmet-swing-browns-steelers-fine/p6a4y3lcs6841h6yyhthae7t2">was not punished</a> for his role that led to Myles Garrett ripping the helmet off of the Steelers quarterback's head, and then hitting him with it.</p>
      <p>While Garrett's actions were clearly more severe, leading to an indefinite suspension by the league, many felt Rudolph was not without blame and that he got off the hook too easily. Rudolph had escalated the situation on the ground as cameras caught him attempting to rip off Garrett's helmet before anything else took place.</p>
      <p>The video also shows an apparent kick to Garrett's groin, although that looked more incidental than purposeful.</p>

      <p>Rudolph then extended the skirmishby chasing Garrett after his helmet was ripped off.</p>
      <p>ESPN's Max Kellerman was especially vocal about Rudolph's role (his comments were made before the suspensions were announced) during Friday morning's "First Take."</p>
      <p>"Mason Rudolph needs to be suspended at least a game," Kellerman said. "He was the one who started the fight, tried to take Myles Garrett's helmet off."</p>

      <p>Kellerman wasn't the only one who thought Rudolph got off easy, and that was before the suspensions were announced. Several fans and even players pointed out that Rudolph escalated the incident.</p>

      <p>While Rudolph wasn't announced in the initial punishments handed down by the NFL, it doesn't exactly mean he's clear. The NFL said in its statement that "additional discipline for other players will be forthcoming through the standard accountability process including those players that left the bench to enter the fight area."</p>
      <p>Having said that, though, it seems if Rudolph weregoing to be punished harshly by the league he would have been included in the initial statement by the league. He seems to have avoided suspension completely, but NFL Media'sTom Pelissero <a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1195409049233158144">says</a> Rudolph will be fined for his role. It's not clear when, or how much.</p>
