      <h1>'This is something practical': Senator's Christmas push for the bush</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Judith Ireland</a></address>
      <p>NSW Liberal Senator Hollie Hughes knows first-hand how tough drought can be on a small business.</p>
      <p>The first-term parliamentarian and her husband Stewart used to have a contract harvesting business in the northern NSW town of Moree. After two floods, an autism diagnosis for their son Fred, and then drought, they lost the business in 2017.</p>

      <p>"Financially, our buffer was lost, funding [Fred's] early intervention program, which we wouldn't change," Senator Hughes told <i>The Sun-Herald</i> and <i>The Sunday Age</i>. "But when the drought really started to bite, there's only so long you can sustain your business where there isn't any work.</p>
      <p>"The family home went, everything went."</p>
      <p>During a recent conversation with a friend who owns a printing business in the NSW town of Inverell, Senator Hughes – who now lives in Sydney – came up with a plan to help rural and regional businesses that are struggling during the drought.</p>

      <p>She has set up the "Go Country for Christmas" online directory of businesses and is encouraging people to buy at least one Christmas gift from the bush this year.</p>
      <p>"People want to know what they can do about this drought. This is something practical," she says, adding the site is also open to rural and regional businesses beyond drought-affected areas.</p>
      <p>"We just wanted to do something that was simple and clean and easy."</p>
      <p>The businesses listed range from a scrunchie maker in NSW's Wee Waa to a hemp farm in Victoria's Spring Hill and a gift shop in Queensland's Stanthorpe.</p>
      <p>To fund the costs of running the website, she has asked MPs across federal parliament to make a $200 contribution. In an approach that has raised eyebrows among some in Canberra, she is naming all donors on the website – so it is clear who has helped and who has not.</p>
      <p>"You know what, everyone loves talking about the drought, let's make the MPs put their hand in their pocket," she said.</p>
      <p>So far, more than 30 MPs have signed up from the Liberal, Labor, National and Greens parties, in a marked contrast to the bitter arguments that have dominated drought and bushfire responses in recent weeks. This includes Prime Minister Scott Morrison, cabinet ministers Angus Taylor, Dan Tehan and Michaelia Cash, as well as Nationals leader Michael McCormack, LNP backbencher George Christensen, Labor frontbencher Mark Dreyfus, Victorian Labor senator Raff Ciccone and Greens senator Rachel Siewert.</p>
      <p>One of the "Go Country for Christmas" participants is Carolyn Ditchfield, the owner of Funki Munki, a "healthy general store" in drought-ravaged Inverell.</p>
      <p>Ms Ditchfield said she is starting to notice more online orders come through from regional and city customers. She said Funki Munki has not been hit as hard as agricultural and luxury businesses in town, but noted, "it feels tight. I'm in a holding pattern".</p>
      <p>Other initiatives are also encouraging city shoppers to buy from regional stores, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5396c.html">including the grassroots social media campaign #buyfromthebush</a> and the NSW government's "Buy Regional" online hub.</p>
