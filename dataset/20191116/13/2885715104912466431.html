        <figcaption>HIT: Anushka Sharma looked absolutely dazzling in a metallic dress with puffy sleeves from designer Sonam Parmar Jhawar.

        <figcaption>HIT: Deepika Padukone was recently spotted in a red dress from the label Rosie Assoulin. Styled by Shaleena Nathani, the cold-shouldered puff sleeve dress was rounded out with matching lipstick, filled-in eyebrows and a hint of glitter on the eyelids. (Source: Instagram)</figcaption>

Styled by celebrity stylist Ami Patel, she completed her look with a classy white scarf tied in a neat manner around her neck, along with white peep-toe stilettos by Luxe Project. The cute little bag from Coach cannot be missed. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: Karisma Kapoor was spotted looking lovely in a black and white dress from designer Prabal Gurung. Styled by celebrity stylist Tanya Ghavri, the monochrome dress stood out for its sharp cuts — showing that monochrome can never be boring. The look was rounded out with hair neatly tied in a ponytail, and accessorised with studs from the label Azotiique. (Source: Instagram)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>MISS: Styled by Tanya Ghavri, Malaika Arora was spotted in an asymmetrical red dress from H&amp;M. While the outfit worked, the way it was styled just did not. The dress, which stood out for its elaborate details and plunging neckline, was accessorised with dainty neckpieces from H Craft Fine Jewellery — which we feel just did not go with the look. Ideally, a dress as ostentatious as that should not have been accessorised. The look was rounded out with matching lipstick and hair tied in a bun. (Source: APH Images)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: Sonam Kapoor opted for an Roland Mouret ensemble that combined a pair of relaxed beige trousers with a floral satin blouse and a matching blazer. For the outing, Kapoor ditched a bespoke suit and opted for a relaxed look. She rounded out her look with black Armani heels and a Rheson top handle bag that matched the colour of her trousers.

        <figcaption>MISS: Rasika Dugal was spotted at the event in an ensemble from Dolly J that consisted a sheer top with voluminous sleeves and a black skirt. We feel the elaborate top would have worked if it was teamed with a plainer skirt. Similarly, a plain grey top would have gone well with the black asymmetrical skirt. And what just did not go with the look was the elaborate belt that it was accessorised with. It could work for another outfit, not this. In fact, the top, skirt and the belt seemed part of a different ensemble clubbed together by accident here. Styled by Who Wore What When, the look was rounded out with hair parted at the centre, grey eye shadow and flaky make-up. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: Tara Sutaria stepped out in a black floral printed custom limited edition jacket created from recycled textile by Gopi Vaid. The jacket, which had a deep neckline, 3/4th sleeves and a long front slit, was paired with blue denim shorts — which added some drama to the look. White sneakers, half ponytail and oversized hoops from Aditi Amin completed the Indo-western look. She stuck to minimal makeup and looked lovely pretty. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>
