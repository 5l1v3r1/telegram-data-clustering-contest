      <p>Facebook user Inini ndini in Mugadza posted a derogatory meme featuring Khama Billiat showing an intrigued attentive Nare his tattoos that read:</p>
      <p>“Pokello competing to become the goal posts if you know you know nyaya yangu ndatopedza.”</p>
      <p>Nare’s Warriors visit has been viewed as a distraction that instilled misplaced priorities on the players contributing to yesterday’s poor result.</p>
      <p>Former legendary Warriors left back George Mbwando also criticised Nare’s warriors visit as unprofessional conduct that jeopardized the national team’s integrity.</p>
      <p>“If Pokello is allowed in Camp then that’s not a camp…call it something else, in our days this would never happen,” he said.</p>
      <p>The general view of most soccer stakeholders is that the warriors camp is not a recreational leisure spot for taking pictures to gain traction on social media. <b>Nehanda Radio</b></p>
