      <h1>Motley Crue Respond to Reunion Petition: ‘This Is Interesting…’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:55:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Wilkening</a></address>
      <p>As rumors of a 2020 <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/motley-crue/">Motley Crue</a> tour continue to intensify, the band's Twitter account has stoked the embers a bit, sharing a reunion petition and declaring it "interesting."</p>
      <p>As of press time, 9,000 fans had supported the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/motley-crue-bring-motley-crue-back">Change.org petition</a>, which declares "if the rumors circulating about a Motley Crue comeback are true, then let this petition solidify it. The new fans need a new tour, PLEASE COME BACK."</p>
      <p>The band has not performed together <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-farewell-show/">since Dec. 31, 2015</a>, the last show of their farewell tour. The band signed a "cessation of touring" agreement prior to embarking on the trek, designed to prohibit any and all future live engagements under the Motley Crue banner.</p>
      <p>Just prior to that final show, bassist <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/nikki-sixx/">Nikki Sixx</a> declared that "<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/nikki-sixx-motley-crue-reunion/">all hell would rain down</a> on any lawyers or promoters or anyone out there who thinks they are going to go sneaking around" that agreement, insisting that "dignity is the most important thing."</p>
      <p>At the same time, singer <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/vince-neil/">Vince Neil</a> blasted <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/kiss/">Kiss</a> for having "five farewell tours and four reunion tours. That's exactly what we don't want to do... we wanted to go out on top, with people saying, 'Yeah, man, I saw the last concert. It was awesome!'" (His math is a little off, as Kiss' farewell tour count <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-2000-farewell-tour/">currently stands at two</a>.)</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, while appearing on the <a href="https://www.howardstern.com/schedule/">Howard Stern</a> Wrap-Up Show, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-black-crowes/">Black Crowes</a> manager Mark DiDia said that <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/black-crowes-reunion-tour/">his band's reunion tour</a> wouldn't be the only one rock fans could look forward to next year, specifically citing a triple bill with Motley Crue and two other major bands.</p>
      <p>"There’s a Motley Crue / <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/poison/">Poison</a> / <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/def-leppard/">Def Leppard</a> tour coming, there’s a <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/rage-against-the-machine/">Rage Against the Machine</a>... <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/ac-dc/">AC/DC</a>’s coming. There’s a lot of rock coming out next year. God bless <a href="https://popcrush.com/tags/drake/">Drake</a> and <a href="https://popcrush.com/tags/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a> and all that, they're streaming music and they have a lot of followers. Rock doesn’t stream, but there’s a thing that’s happening. I think people miss guitars and bass and drums.”</p>
      <p>Without naming names, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bret-michaels-new-poison-music/">earlier this month</a> Poison singer Bret Michaels revealed that he was "working real hard right now to put together something incredible with some other bands for next summer."</p>
      <p>The success of this spring's Netflix biopic <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-the-dirt-fact-vs-fiction/"><i>The Dirt</i></a> has renewed industry interest in a Motley Crue reunion tour, with <a href="https://radaronline.com/videos/motley-crue-rockers-vince-neil-tommy-lee-battle-rehab/">RadarOnline</a> citing unnamed sources in reporting that the band has been offered $150 million to get back together.</p>
      <p>Neil soon took to Twitter to deny the report, which also stated that he and drummer <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/tommy-lee/">Tommy Lee</a> were fighting over which one of them needed to go to rehab for alcohol abuse prior to agreeing to the reunion: "People these rumors are false. I haven’t spoken to any band member(s) since (<i>The Dirt</i>) movie premiere. I had to cancel shows due to back problems (for) which I am getting treatment now. There is no tension between me and Tommy. Don’t believe anything from (t)hese so-called gossip sites."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Sixx told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/motley-crue-the-dirt-soundtrack-interview-798822/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> that he occasionally second-guesses the band's decision. “Sometimes I look out at my friends, like the guys in <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/aerosmith/">Aerosmith</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/metallica/">Metallica</a>, and I’m like, ‘God damn it, did we retire too soon?'” he said. “But there will be no one-offs in our future. Maybe we’ll just get together and jam in Mick Mars’ front room.”</p>

      <h3>Motley Crue Lineup Changes: A Complete Guide</h3>

      <h4>1981-1992: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>Motley Crue played their first show on April 24, 1981, opening for Y&amp;T at Hollywood's Starwood Hotel. Thanks in part to high-profile gigs as Ozzy Osbourne's opening act and at the US Festival, the often controversial group quickly rose to the top of the hard-rock landscape. Their sophomore album, 'Shout at the Devil,' cracked the Top 20 in 1983, and three more multi-platinum efforts followed before the close of the decade. In the fall of 1991 they signed a lucrative new record contract reportedly worth as much as $35 million. But personality conflicts and a difference of opinion about the band's musical direction led to singer Vince Neil's ouster in February 1992.</p>

      <h4>1992-1996: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, John Corabi</h4>
      <p>A year after Neil made a respectable start to his solo career with the Steve Stevens-powered 'Exposed' album, Motley Crue emerged with new singer John Corabi and a heavier, more serious sound. The new lineup's self-titled 1994 LP didn't connect well with most of the band's earlier audience, though it has since obtained a cult-favorite status among fans. The accompanying tour was poorly attended, and partway through the creation of a follow-up record, Corabi -- frustrated by what he deemed a dizzying series of changing creative directions -- parted ways with the band.</p>

      <h4>1996-1999: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>With Motley Crue's commercial fortunes in free fall, and Neil's sophomore album 'Carved in Stone' failing to crack the Top 100, the original foursome decided to reunite and complete the already in-progress 'Generation Swine' record. In retrospect, they probably would have been better starting fresh, as the final result was a muddled mess of material that was ill-suited to his vocal style. The following Motley Crue vs. the Earth tour was better received, and everything seemed to be back on track.</p>

      <h4>1999-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Randy Castillo</h4>
      <p>Turns out the original lineup's second stint didn't last very long. Lee had grown eager to explore other forms of music. "I always told myself that when my heart wasn't in it, it was time to quit," he explained in the band's official autobiography 'The Dirt.' "And my heart wasn't in it." When he left to form the band Methods of Mayhem, Motley Crue replaced him with former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo, with whom they recorded 2000's back-to-basics 'New Tattoo.' A cancer diagnosis soon forced Castillo off the tour in support of the album and claimed his life in March 2002.</p>

      <h4>2000-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Samantha Maloney</h4>
      <p>With Castillo sidelined for health reasons, Motley Crue enlisted former Hole drummer Samantha Maloney to play drums on the band's 'New Tattoo' tour. "The entire band was very supportive and respectful of me. I had the time of my life!," she told NRK. "Some of the fans at first were hesitant, but I won each and every fan over every night after song one." Maloney can be seen and heard on 2001's 'Lewd, Crued &amp; Tattooed' concert video, and would go on to work with Eagles of Death Metal and Peaches.</p>

      <h4>2004-2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>After a two-year hiatus, Motley Crue's original lineup reunited for the second time in 2004. "The only thing people ask us about is if we're getting along. Of course we get along," Lee told 'The Guardian,' addressing the band's previous public squabbles. "Time heals -- it's been six years. People change, grow up. I think we all have the attitude now that if we could just fucking get along instead of fucking with each other, we could continue to do this for as long as anybody wants to." Over the next decade, they released one more studio album (2008's 'Saints of Los Angeles'), headlined two editions of the Crue Fest festival and shared co-headlining bills with Aerosmith and Kiss before embarking on a farewell tour that concluded on New Year's Eve 2015.</p>

      <h4>June 2007: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Will Hunt</h4>
      <p>When an am injury forced Lee to miss two U.K. show on Motley Crue's 2007 summer tour, he reached out to Evanescence drummer and Crue fan Will Hunt. "I just happened to be in London for four days on a break," Hunt told MusicRadar in 2010. "Tommy called me and said, 'I need you to play tonight!'" Lee rallied enough to play "Kickstart My Heart" at one of the shows.</p>

      <h4>August 2009: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Morgan Rose</h4>
      <p>Two years later, another injury -- this time the result of playing with sparklers -- put Lee out of action for a pair of shows on the Crue Fest 2 tour. Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose was there to fill in. Eager to earn his keep, Lee hung around onstage to add backing vocals and play piano on "Home Sweet Home."</p>

      <h4>October 2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Glen Sobel</h4>
      <p>A tendinitis flareup knocked Lee off the drum stool for a handful of shows on the band's farewell tour. Alice Cooper was opening the entire tour, and his powerhouse drummer Glen Sobel was there to fill in, with Lee performing his by now customary "Home Sweet Home" duties.</p>
