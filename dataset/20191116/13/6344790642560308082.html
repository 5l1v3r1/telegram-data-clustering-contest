      <blockquote>Pilgrim Finch is an adventurous astronaut bear who explores the cosmos with a mission to bring samples of life back to his home planet. But when he crash lands on a new planet full of surprises and danger around every corner, Pilgrim will be forced to question his orders and learn that there’s only one mission that matters - compassion for all living creatures, no matter the stakes!</blockquote>
      <p>Young released the following statement about <i>Space Bear</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>SPACE BEAR is one of my favorite projects I’ve worked on that is meant for readers of any age. My aim was to make a wordless story that early readers, as well as kids and grown-ups will love. I hope you enjoy following Pilgrim’s adventures as much as I enjoyed creating them!</blockquote>
      <p><i>Space Bear</i> will be available in June 2020.</p>
