      <h1>The dread and worry keeping young Australians up at night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Fitzsimmons</a></address>
      <p>My eight-year-old son has come up with a solution to global warming. "Mum, we need to build a giant space fan to cool down the Earth," he said.</p>
      <p>If only we could.</p>
      <p>There is no denial of climate change in my household. Nor is there any denial that Australia must play its part in reducing emissions. Sure, we can't do it on our own but that's not an excuse to do nothing. Gosh, in another era Australia might even have shown leadership.</p>

      <p>Yet it's a fine line as a parent between acknowledging scientific reality and causing alarm, especially when you have imaginative children already prone to anxiety.</p>
      <p>All around me I see climate change casting a pall of dread and despair over so many lives. I've long thought this must be a factor in the skyrocketing rates of depression and anxiety, especially among the young.</p>
      <p>Now the peak body for psychologists has confirmed my hunch.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://psychweek.org.au/2019-report/">Australian Psychological Society (APS) has called for governments</a> to declare a climate emergency, having reviewed the research on climate anxiety among young people and established a Youth Advisory Group of 16 to 25 year olds to dig deeper.</p>
      <p>It comes the same week that a <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53amr.html">major medical report warns of the effects of a heating climate</a> on both physical and mental health.</p>
      <p>The APS says 95 per cent of Australian youth believe climate change is a serious problem – and they're extremely worried.</p>
      <p>Four in five young people are anxious about climate change and concerned it will reduce their quality of life in the future.</p>
      <p>One in five say they are planning either not to have children or have fewer children because of climate change.</p>
      <blockquote>Scientists have warned us for decades that climate change will increase the prevalence of drought and bushfires.</blockquote>
      <p>One in six have reported losing sleep due to worry about climate change.</p>
      <p>And three in four young people say their opinions and fears about the climate crisis are being ignored or not taken seriously.</p>
      <p>Cue anger, frustration, depression, sadness, grief, anxiety and feelings of powerlessness. "These mental health effects are expected to escalate because of the increasing risk of extreme weather disasters and other longer-term impacts such as prolonged droughts, loss of liveability and forced migration," the report says. "Children are particularly vulnerable during and after climate-related emergencies and their mental-health risks are expected to escalate as climate change intensifies."</p>
      <p>Last week when I was <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53926.html">reporting on the NSW bushfires</a>, I spoke to a business owner in Old Bar on the Mid North Coast who described how all the children in town were in tears with the fear and stress because of the smoke, encroaching fire and evacuations.</p>
      <p>The bushfires are particularly bad this year because the drought has left the bush as dry as a tinder box. Scientists have warned us for decades that climate change will increase the prevalence of drought and bushfires.</p>
      <p>My heart goes out to everyone affected by the bushfires, which include members of my own family. The APS says research suggests children and young people who are exposed to climate-related extreme weather-events experience increases in post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep and anxiety disorders, learning problems and cognitive deficit.</p>
      <p>For young people not in the direct line of fire, it's a more generalised dread.</p>
      <p>Those in the APS advisory group call on all of us to develop empathy with the "people of the future" and to remember that our children and grandchildren will inherit the consequences of the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>They expressed frustration about the lack of political action and uncertainty about how they could individually make a difference – a feeling they found overwhelming at times.</p>
      <p>The antidote was action. The APS said young people felt "more supported and more hopeful around climate change" when they were actively involved in pro-environmental behaviours and supported by parents, teachers and peers.</p>
      <p>Parents can help by being great role models in their own climate change understanding and activism, listening to their children's concerns and encouraging them to be interested in the issues, and supporting them in the choices they make (such as by driving them to meetings or letting them join the school strike).</p>
      <p>Denialism based on false hope and nihilism based on despair are both poor responses to the climate crisis.</p>

      <p>Psychology offers an alternative with the concept of "constructive hope", a type of meaning-focused coping based on pro-environmental behaviours and collective action.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison says "we've got to let kids be kids" and warns against causing them "needless anxiety".</p>
      <p>If only we could.</p>
