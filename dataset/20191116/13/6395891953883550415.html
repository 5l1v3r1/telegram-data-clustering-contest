      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Ohio's gun season for deer is set to begin early next month.</p>
      <p>This year's deer-gun season runs Dec. 2 through Dec. 8, with an additional weekend of hunting Dec. 21 and Dec. 22.</p>
      <p>The Ohio's Department of Natural Resources Division of Wildlife says hunters harvested more than 60,500 deer during last year's weeklong gun season and more than 9,600 animals during a weekend hunt.</p>
      <p>State officials advise hunters to check the 2019-2020 Ohio Hunting and Trapping Regulations for county-specific bag limits, updates on permits and other information.</p>
      <p>The statewide bag limit is six deer.</p>
      <p>Ohio's youth-only deer-gun season is Nov. 23 and 24.</p>
