      <p>Once again this week, we spotted actors from B-town moving in and out of the airport, looking fine and putting their best fashion foot forward. From traditional to western wear, we got a glimpse of an eclectic choice of clothing which did not disappoint.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/alia-bhatt/">Alia Bhatt</a> to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/priyanka-chopra/">Priyanka Chopra</a> Jonas and Kiara Advani, here are some of the best airport looks of the week. Pick your favourite.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alia Bhatt</b>

      <p>‘Chic’ and ‘comfortable’ are the two words that describe Alia Bhatt’s look. Here, she’s seen wearing a black camisole along with jeggings, and a gorgeous pastel pink trench coat which has puffy sleeves and frill detailing. She has completed the look by tying her hair in a neat bun and a pair of basic white sneakers. The trolley bag can’t be missed out. The lavender sits perfectly with the outfit.</p>

      <p>The <i>Quantico </i>star was spotted at the airport this week giving us all the bossy formal vibes with a hint of chic. The cult white shirt-jeans look was given an edge with puffy sleeves. Instead of the basic blue denims, she chose grey washed jeans. Her look was completed with golden peep-toe stilettos and a black rectangular tote.</p>

        <b>Kiara Advani</b>

      <p>The <i>Kabir Singh</i> actor was also spotted walking out of the Mumbai airport in a sapphire blue Adidas tracksuit earlier this week. The velvet outfit certainly makes for a great choice during winters. We like how Kiara Advani kept it simple and teamed the tracksuit set with a basic white top. She styled the look with metallic sneakers and a pair of sunnies.</p>

      <p>Spotted on their way back from Amritsar, the couple looked regal. Both of them were clad in Sabyasachi creations and were at their traditional best. While Padukone was seen in a maroon <i>kurta</i> with intricate detailing, she teamed it up with a <i>dhoti</i>. This is, for sure, a fresh approach to styling <i>kurtas</i>. Her look was completed with a nude lip shade, a hint of mauve on the crease of her eyelids and a heavy neckpiece. She was styled by Shaleeni Nathani.</p>
      <p>Singh was seen in a floral <i>kurta pyjama</i> set teamed with a purple flower detailing Nehru jacket. He completed his look with a suave pair of sunglasses.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aditi Rao Hydari</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Chic or cute? We can’t decide but, Rao surely turned heads at the airport in this attire. She opted for an XL black hoodie from Adidas with a ripped pair of black denim shorts, and white sneakers from Fila. We are rooting for this look.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bhumi Pednekar</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>The <i>Saand Ki Aankh </i>actor is giving us the biker chic feels and we aren’t complaining. She’s teamed her athleisure black fitted T-shirt with basic black track pants and netboot heels. The neon green waist sling bag and the biker sunglasses give it much edge.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Parineeti Chopra keeps it sleek with this peach-coloured pantsuit. She’s teamed her high-waist peach colour pants with a basic white camisole and a pair of white sneakers. She completes her look with a playful pair of bright orange sunglasses and minimal layered gold jewellery.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Karishma Kapoor</b>
      </p>

      <p>Karishma Kapoor looks breathtakingly beautiful in this <i>kurta</i> set. It is, hands down, the traditional outfit for a long flight. She has teamed her printed <i>kurta</i> with a pair of mustard palazzos which have a similar print, and Kolhapuri <i>chappals</i>. The tote and her sunglasses perfectly mix with the outfit.</p>
