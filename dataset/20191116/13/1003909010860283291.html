      <h1>Brooks: Distinguished Policy Fellow Awards Dinner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:00:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Brooks, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The Distinguished Policy Fellowships are awarded annually to leaders in public policy research, education, development, implementation or advocacy.</p>
      <p>The exclusive list of those awarded fellowships include former prime minister Stephen Harper, Thomas Jenkins, Thomas d’Aquino and Nancy Southern. Jim Gray and Steve Williams joined this impressive group at the Third Annual Distinguished Policy Fellow Awards Dinner held Nov. 7 at The Westin.</p>
      <p>Given to eminent individuals committed to improving Canada through leadership and support of sound public policy, the Distinguished Policy Fellow Award is the highest honour given by The School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. It’s apt that Gray and Williams were this year’s appointees. Both oilmen, their combined contributions to the oil and gas industry is staggering. Gray, founder and former chairman and CEO of Canadian Hunter Exploration, was engaged for more than 50 years in oil and natural gas exploration in western Canada. And Williams, former president, CEO and board member of Suncor, has advocated for policies that support sustainable development in the energy sector for more than 40 years.</p>
      <p>Highlights this night were numerous, including remarks from: U of C president and vice-chancellor Ed McCauley; PG Forest, professor and director of the James S. and Barbara A. Palmer Chair in Public Policy; and Sandip Lalli, president and CEO, Calgary Chamber.</p>
      <p>Guest speaker Chantal Hebert, national affairs writer at the Toronto Star, delivered a powerful address while CHQR talk show host Danielle Smith did an admirable job as the evening’s emcee. Others in attendance included: award presenters Eshleen Grewal and Shamus Hardie; David Werklund and his wife Susan Norman; U of C chancellor Deborah Yedlin; corporate director Mike Wilson; 2018 appointee Nancy Southern; ATCO’s Mike Shaw; Payload CEO Phil Roberts; BA Capital’s Art Agolli; and Miller Thomson partner Gerald Chipeur and his wife Dr. Barbara Chipeur. Proceeds from this year’s sold-out event support Master of Public Policy student scholarships at the U of C.</p>
