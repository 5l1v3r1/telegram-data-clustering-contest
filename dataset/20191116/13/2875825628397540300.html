      <h1>Conor McGregor reflects on Irish Mirror's coverage of his famous double world title win</h1>
      <h2>The Irishman became the first ever two-weight UFC champion just over three years ago</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:13:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror Sport</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor has reflected on the Irish Mirror's coverage of his historic Lightweight title win in New York three years ago.</p>
      <p>The Irishman became the first ever two-weight UFC champion at Madison Square Garden, in what was the first UFC event to be held in the state after the sport was unbanned.</p>
      <p>And responding to journalist Petesy Carroll sharing a photo of the two-page spread featured on the Mirror on Twitter, McGregor said: "Ah the aul mirror".</p>
      <p>It was, to date, McGregor's last win inside the octagon - he lost a boxing match to Floyd Mayweather in 2017 and then was submitted last year in a UFC lightweight title fight with Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>But Conor McGregor's striking coach has declared that the Irishman is in "phenomenal shape" ahead of his January return to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ufc">UFC</a> .</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">The former two-weight World champion</a> is expected to take on Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone on January 18 having not fought since he was choked out by Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>And his long-time striking coach and friend Owen Roddy is confident McGregor will be back as good as ever.</p>
      <p>"I know he’s working very hard," he told MMA Junkie. "There’s no official date set yet, but Conor’s been training very hard, as you can see - he’s in good nick.</p>
      <p>"If you're looking at any of the pictures, he's in phenomenal shape, he’s ready to go. I’m sure everybody’s excited to see him back.</p>
