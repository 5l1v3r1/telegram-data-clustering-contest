      <h4>There’s nothing like a little sparkle and shine on the red carpet. Stars like Kristen Stewart, Kim Kardashian, Sofia Richie love to dazzle in gorgeous sparkly dresses.</h4>
      <p>Sparkly dresses are all the rage these days. Your favorite stars are all about stepping out onto red carpets and at events in eye-catching looks. <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/celebs-sparkly-dresses-cannes-outfits-3613289/">Sparkly dresses</a> are the very definition of eye-catching. In front of the lights and cameras, sparkly dresses really pop. It’s no wonder why celebs love them so much.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/kristen-stewart"><b>Kristen Stewart</b></a>, 29, is one of the recent stars to don a sexy sparkly dress. She hit the <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> purple carpet on Nov. 11 in a sparkling cutout dress. The rainbow-colored dress was one of KStew’s best looks of the <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> press tour. Since her sparkly dress was already pretty glitzy, Kristen paired her dress with a pair of simple navy heels. <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/pics/celebrities-in-sparkly-dresses-photos/">The look</a> was sexy, edgy, and perfect for Kristen.</p>
      <p>The KarJenners clearly have tons of sparkly dresses in their closets. <b>Kim Kardashian</b>, 39, sizzled in a sparkling silver mini dress at the Versace show in Dec. 2018. The sexy look made Kim shine bright like a diamond. <b>Kourtney Kardashian</b>, 40, dazzled in a glitzy purple mini dress while out for <b>Kylie Jenner’s</b> 21st birthday in 2019. Kylie, 22, has also rocked a number of sparkly dresses, including a silver mini dress during Fashion Week in New York City.</p>
