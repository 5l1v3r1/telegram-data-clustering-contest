      <p>The Rozsa Foundation celebrated the 16th Annual Rozsa Awards Oct. 28 at the Jack Singer Concert Hall Lobby. The event celebrates excellence in arts management and board leadership across Alberta. The Rozsa Awards Jury chose three nomiees for each of the awards. These arts executives who work behind the scenes were honoured for their leadership in moving their organizations forward through innovation and outstanding management. The jury of peers this year included Sheila O’Brien and Bob McPhee.</p>
      <p>Unique in Canada, the Rozsa Awards are highly sought-after with a monetary prize, accompanying public profile, and educational and professional development opportunities. Founded by Ted and Lola Rozsa in 2002, the foundation has since distributed over $1 million in benefits to award recipients and their organizations across Alberta.</p>
      <p>The winner of the Excellence in Arts Management Award went to Sara Leishman, executive director of the Calgary Folk Music Festival.</p>
      <p>The winner of the Excellence in Board Leadership Award went to Tara Owen, board chair of Alberta Craft Council.</p>
