      <p><b>VATICAN CITY (AP)</b> - Pope Francis has urged the Vatican's pediatric hospital to make "prudent" choices as it expands to welcome more patients.</p>
      <p>In the wake of a new investment scandal that led to the ouster of a top manager, Francis held a special audience for Bambino Gesu staff and patients Saturday to mark the hospital's 150th anniversary.</p>
      <p>Hospital president Mariella Enoc referred to recent "tortuous" efforts to balance the hospital's needs and resources, and thanked Francis for supporting her "in the most difficult moment" of her tenure.</p>
      <p>Enoc fired her top manager in July, reportedly after he made ill-advised real estate investments.</p>
      <p>Francis referred to "many difficulties" at the hospital, and asked that going forward it makes "choices that are courageous and rigorous and at the same time generous and prudent."</p>
