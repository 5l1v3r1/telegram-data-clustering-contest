      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:50:16+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/dan-kay/" target="_blank">Dan Kay</a></address>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to the oldest living former captain of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool FC</a>, Johnny Wheeler, who has died at the age of 91.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crosby">Crosby</a>-born Wheeler played 177 games for the Reds between 1956 and 1961, scoring 23 goals, but did not arrive at Anfield until he was 28 years old having begun his career with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tranmere-rovers-fc">Tranmere Rovers</a> in 1944.</p>
      <p>He played 101 league games for the Prenton Park side before joining Bolton Wanderers in 1951 and featured in the famous 1953 'Stanley Matthews' FA Cup final which the Trotters lost 4-3 to a last minute goal having led 3-1.</p>

      <p>Phil Taylor brought him to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/anfield">Anfield</a> for a fee of £9,000 in the summer of 1956 and he made an immediate impact, scoring one of the quickest hat-tricks ever recorded when bagging a treble against Port Vale that November, notching in the 81st, 82nd and 85th minutes in a 4-1 Reds win.</p>

      <p>Taylor appointed Wheeler, who was capped once by England, skipper at the beginning of the 1958/59 season but by the start of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bill-shankly">Bill Shankly</a>'s first full season, 1960/61, he had to share the number 4 shirt with Gordon Milne and was gradually phased out of the team, making his final appearance against Plymouth Argyle in December 1961.</p>
      <p>Wheeler was appointed player-manager of former Football League club New Brighton but never took up the post and became assistant-trainer at Bury where he stayed until 1969.</p>

      <p>Reds CEO Peter Moore shared a picture of him presenting Wheeler with framed photo from his playing days signed by Jurgen Klopp on a visit to Anfield last year and wrote: "Saddened to hear of passing of Johnny Wheeler, a great player and captain for the football club.</p>
      <p>"We take comfort in that we were honoured and privileged to welcome Johnny to Anfield last season, where we were proud to present him a photo signed by Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>"YNWA Johnny."</p>

      <p>Johnny and his daughter Sue were interviewed by <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2018/04/johnny-wheeler-the-story-of-liverpool-fcs-oldest-living-captain/">Jeff Goulding from This Is Anfield</a> ahead of his return to Anfield last season and, while sadly suffering from dementia by this stage, he spoke of how he fulfilled a childhood ambition in playing at Anfield.. “I was a Red. I’m a Liverpool lad".. as well as how Billy Liddell was the greatest player he ever played with, the pair of them sharing the honour of having streets named after them, with Wheeler Drive and Liddell Avenue being sited within yards of each other in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/melling">Melling</a> area of the city, near <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree">Aintree</a> (read the full interview <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2018/04/johnny-wheeler-the-story-of-liverpool-fcs-oldest-living-captain/">here</a> ).</p>
      <p>Johnny’s daughter told of how important she felt it was for clubs to acknowledge the contribution of former players, for Bolton Wanderers also having welcomed Johnny back in recent times.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think it’s important because men like my dad represent the foundations, the beginnings of the club we see today. He is part of the history and we are very fortunate that he is still alive at the age of 90. I am very proud of his achievements. We all are.</p>
      <p>“Dad told me that on match days he would travel to the ground on the bus, with my granddad and my brother. Then, at the end of the game, tired from his exertions, he would run over to where they were in the stands, and take them down to the dressing room.”</p>
