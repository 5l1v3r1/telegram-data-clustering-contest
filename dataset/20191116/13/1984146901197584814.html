      <h1>Mum shares teacher's brilliant idea to end pressure on parents to buy gifts for school staff</h1>
      <h2>A teacher at St Patrick's School, in Dipton, said she 'thoroughly enjoys' being a teacher and doesn't need a Christmas present</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:13:18+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham</a></address>
      <p>Parents have praised a teacher who asked her students not bring her a present - and do something "heart-warming" instead.</p>
      <p>With presents to buy for family, friends and the kids, Christmas can be a difficult time for parents before they even consider the tricky question of gifts for teachers.</p>
      <p>So this year, one <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a> teacher decided to make things easier for everyone.</p>
      <p>Steff Ravenhall was delighted last week when her daughter, Harriet Waring, came home with a letter that lifted the festive load a little.</p>
      <p>The note, from seven-year-old Harriet's teacher Mrs Gardener, thanked parents for their "kind generosity" but told them: "I would like to reduce your stress a little and ask that you don't buy me a gift."</p>

      <p>She wrote: "I thoroughly enjoy teaching your children and my job is a pleasure to do."</p>
      <p>But this wasn't just a ban on presents - instead, Mrs Gardener, deputy head and year two teacher at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/st-patricks-roman-catholic-voluntary-6487239">St Patrick's Roman Catholic Voluntary Aided School</a> , in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/dipton">Dipton</a> , Stanley, invited families to send in an anonymous donation of no more than Â£2 to help those in greater need.</p>
      <p>And the request was not only charitable, but educational too.</p>
      <p>She said: "This half term we will be focusing on money in maths and the real meaning of Christmas in our RE lessons. With this in mind I would like the children to be involved in the social responsibility of giving and and kindness and plan to support a local family."</p>
      <p>Once the envelopes have been received, the children, she said, would count up the money and use it to plan which items to purchase from a local shop.</p>
      <p>Receiving the letter, Steff, 26, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/annfield-plain">Annfield Plain</a> , said she was impressed by the idea, and shared a picture of it on Facebook, in the hope of encouraging other schools to do the same.</p>
      <p>She said: "I just thought it was really heart-warming, and it obviously takes the pressure off, because you do worry about getting the teachers presents at this time of year.</p>
      <p>"My daughter has been to a few different schools and it's always a topic of conversation for the parents, who is getting something, who is not going to bother, how much they're spending. Everyone just wants to get it right.</p>
      <p>"The bit that got me the most was the fact that it was going to a local family. It's an important age, in year two, to be learning about the value of money, which is a really important lesson as well. And it teaches them that it's not just about receiving, it's about giving back.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen another school do anything like this, lots of teachers will say to you 'oh, don't bother', but actually getting a letter saying 'here's what you can do instead' and there's a lesson kids are learning at the same time, that's what's really good about it."</p>
      <p>The mum says she's already received messages online from teachers hoping to share the idea, and Steff's post has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook.</p>
      <p>One woman commented: "This is an amazing idea and I wish other schools would do this!"</p>
      <p>And another said: "This is a wonderful idea! Well done that teacher."</p>
