      <p>TK Kirkland opened up to VladTV about flying women out when he was on tour in the past until realizing that there were already women to meet at the shows. TK explained how it's cheaper to meet women at the shows, but adds that if a woman he's into can't afford to buy a ticket to come out and see him, the show is not for her. </p>
      <p>TK went on to speak about having five kids and Too Short having his first at 52, which TK thinks is amazing. He explained that they started out around the same time, which led to a conversation about the many projects TK has been involved with over the years. </p>
