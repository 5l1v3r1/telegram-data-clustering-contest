        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Good news for head coach, Molefi Ntseki, as well as Zungu’s club is that his knee injury doesn’t seem to be as bad as first feared, and he could potentially be in contention for their 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier depending on how today’s scan goes.</p>
      <p>The Amiens man had to be taken off after 25 minutes of the 2-0 defeat to Ghana after hurting the same knee that kept him out for a large portion of last season, and was spotted in a knee brace on their return to South Africa earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>Thulani Ngwenya, the Bafana team doctor, today explained the situation regarding the former Mamelodi Sundowns man, also giving an update on both Thamsanqa Mkhize and Thapelo Morena as they look to make sure they’re in contention tomorrow.</p>
      <p>He told the media, “Bongani has sustained a knee injury. The pitch was uneven – it’s not an excuse – and Bongani slipped and strained his knee. When we rushed in he was in excruciating pain, we really tried to get him back on by stabilising him, but he couldn’t so a substitution was forced.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been treating him since then, and he’s made a marked improvement. We’re taking him for a scan today, and only then can we make a decision on whether he’ll be fit for selection tomorrow or not.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ngwenya also went on to give updates on Mkhize and Morena, saying, “We have also Thami Mkhize who sustained an ankle injury, we had to strap him and give him extra medication because we’d used all our substitutions so we had to force him to finish the game. We’ll make a final determination today at training as to whether he will be available.</p>
      <p>“Thapelo Morena has a minor calf strain, and we’re treating him. He should be fine for training today though – otherwise all our players are ready.”</p>
