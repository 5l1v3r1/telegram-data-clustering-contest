      <h1>‘A True Disgrace’: The White House Responds To Claims Of Witness Intimidation</h1>

        <b>The White House responded Friday to suggestions that President Donald Trump’s mid-hearing tweet constituted “witness intimidation.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The statement, initially given in answer to a question from MSNBC’s Hallie Jackson, characterized the president’s tweet as simply his opinion and attacked the ongoing hearing as a “totally illegitimate charade stacked against the President.”</p>
      <blockquote>The tweet was not witness intimidation, it was simply the President’s opinion, which he is entitled to. This is not a trial, it is a partisan political process—or to put it more accurately, a totally illegitimate, charade stacked against the President. There is less due process in this hearing than any such event in the history of our country. It’s a true disgrace</blockquote>
      <p>Trump’s tweet attacked <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/15/flashback-obama-fires-bush-ambassadors/">former U.S. Ambassador</a> to Ukraine <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/15/yovanovitch-testifies-giuliani-smear-campaign-her-ouster/">Marie Yovanovitch</a> while she was still testifying before the committee.</p>

      <p>In addition to attacking Yovanovitch, the president argued that he had done far more for Ukraine than former President Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/15/schiff-witness-intimidation-trump/">Adam Schiff</a> read the president’s tweets into the record and promptly accused Trump of engaging in witness tampering.</p>
