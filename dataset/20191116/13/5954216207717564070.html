      <p>Each year, sudden cardiac death affects 220,000 U.S. adults, most of whom have no prior symptoms of a heart issue.</p>
      <p>By identifying rare DNA variants that substantially increase risk of sudden cardiac death, researchers led by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.broadinstitute.org_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=OVK7sU5mBCVgCUuUkNph1L7MlrZB5FOkJPkpuY88e74&amp;m=lqxoF6q7JINAKuqYVtq4SIYLrx9AuWOcUp3vkb0V4lw&amp;s=8B7_Dmj6p6Xj1Q_KDszcFFgLVwWWh8Z2mnLIrEa9vxc&amp;e=">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a> have laid the foundation for efforts to identify individuals who could benefit from prevention strategies before they experience symptoms.</p>
      <p>The scientists also determined that such variants are present in approximately 1 percent of asymptomatic adults — corresponding to 3 million people in the United States.</p>
      <p>The findings are <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.abstractsonline.com_pp8_-23-21_7891_presentation_35176&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=OVK7sU5mBCVgCUuUkNph1L7MlrZB5FOkJPkpuY88e74&amp;m=lqxoF6q7JINAKuqYVtq4SIYLrx9AuWOcUp3vkb0V4lw&amp;s=5wRUzIvf2XTe2UZOyjZQja6n-ADPTkocGgVq-99X3v8&amp;e=">presented</a> at the Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association and published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.</p>
      <p>The authors performed gene sequencing in 600 adult-onset sudden cardiac death cases and 600 controls who remained healthy — the largest such study performed to date and first to use a control group. A clinical geneticist reviewed all of the DNA variants identified, classifying 15 as clinically important pathogenic variants.</p>
      <p>“Strikingly, all 15 of these pathogenic variants were in sudden cardiac death cases, with none in controls,” said lead author <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__cgm.massgeneral.org_faculty_amit-2Dv-2Dkhera_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=OVK7sU5mBCVgCUuUkNph1L7MlrZB5FOkJPkpuY88e74&amp;m=lqxoF6q7JINAKuqYVtq4SIYLrx9AuWOcUp3vkb0V4lw&amp;s=nK8scP07I2jbsQxwwXdWzkK_P7LTQ3lw177aH43_VdA&amp;e=">Amit V. Khera</a>, cardiologist and associate director of the Precision Medicine Unit at MGH’s Center for Genomic Medicine and the Broad Institute’s Cardiovascular Disease Initiative. The prevalence of a pathogenic variant was found to be 2.5 percent in cases and 0 percent in controls.</p>
      <p>Next, the investigators studied the genes of 4,525 middle-aged adults without any signs of heart disease, finding that 41 (0.9 percent) carried a pathogenic variant. These individuals have been followed for more than 14 years, and those who inherited a pathogenic variant had a more than three times greater risk of dying from cardiovascular causes.</p>
      <aside>“Our hope is to empower our patients to better understand, predict, and prevent bad health outcomes — especially irreversible tragedies such as sudden cardiac death — using genetic information.”<cite>— Amit V. Khera</cite></aside>
      <p>“In my clinical practice, I often encounter families devastated by a sudden and unexpected death. This finding indicates that genetic testing — if made widely available — can provide a way to identify high-risk individuals currently flying under the radar. If identified, we have a variety of approaches proven to prevent disease onset available within routine clinical practice,” said Khera.</p>
      <p>In addition to Khera, the research team was co-led by Sekar Kathiresan, CEO of Verve Therapeutics; Anthony Philippakis, cardiologist and chief data officer at the Broad Institute; and Christine Albert, chair of cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai.</p>
      <p>Based on these results, Khera and colleagues plan to conduct genetic-sequencing tests for thousands of adult patients at MGH and affiliated hospitals who volunteered for a research program designed to understand how genetic and environmental factors impact risk of important diseases. They aim to find the 1 percent of individuals with rare genetic variants linked to heart disease, and offer tailored prevention programs in a Cardiovascular Genetics Program or a new MGH Preventive Genomics Clinic that Khera is co-leading and is embedded within primary care.</p>
      <p>“Our hope is to empower our patients to better understand, predict, and prevent bad health outcomes — especially irreversible tragedies such as sudden cardiac death — using genetic information,” said Khera.</p>
