      <p>Update 11/16/2019 1:40pm:</p>
      <p>Previously, it was reported that Instagram was planning to hide like counts and was to start testing it out this past week. Now, news has surfaced from the company noting they are carrying that test out on a global scale now.</p>
      <p>Via Twitter, IG said “<i>Starting today, we’re expanding our test of private like counts globally. If you’re in the test, you’ll no longer see the total number of likes and views on photos and videos posted to Feed unless they’re your own.</i>”</p>
      <p>An Instagram spokesperson issued a statement and said “<i>Starting today, we’re expanding our test of private like counts to the rest of the world beyond Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, and New Zealand. If you’re in the test, you’ll no longer see the total number of likes and views on photos and videos posted to Feed unless they’re your own. While the feedback from early testing has been positive, this is a fundamental change to Instagram, and so we’re continuing our test to learn more from our global community.</i>”</p>

      <p>Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced that the platform will be hiding likes for its US users as part of a company experiment to lessen the pressure of trying to accumulate endless likes, an initiative targeted specifically at the platform's younger demographic. IG has already tested this on users across the globe in Japan, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Italy, and New Zealand. The trial run is slated to begin next week according to Mosseri. </p>
