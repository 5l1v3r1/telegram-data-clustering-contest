      <p>Former Derby County assistant manager Jody Morris has reportedly been warned by Chelsea about his social media activity after a post in reference to ex-Blues boss Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Morris was <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard's</a> assistant at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Pride Park</a> last season, before moving back to Stamford Bridge with his former teammate when Lampard became the new Chelsea head coach in July.</p>
      <p>Morris is active on Instagram and Twitter, as he was during his Rams spell.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7690741/Chelsea-warn-Jody-Morris-social-media-use-mocked-bitter-Jose-Mourinho.html">the Daily Mail,</a> he has been told by Chelsea "to tone down his social media activity" following the Mourinho post.</p>

      <p>The ex-Blues and Leeds United midfielder retweeted a video clip of Mourinho analysing Chelsea's start to the season, adding the comment: "Jose's still worried", with three laughing face emojis.</p>
      <p>The report adds: "Chelsea feel such activity is unbecoming and inappropriate for a senior member of their coaching team."</p>
      <p>Lampard's side currently sit third in the Premier League table, with 26 points from their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>Among the regulars in the Chelsea team have been Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori, who both enjoyed eye-catching loan spells at Pride Park in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Mount has four goals in 18 appearances, while Tomori has notched 14 appearances, scoring in a win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
