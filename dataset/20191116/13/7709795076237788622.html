        <b>Allmankind was a well-backed winner of the JCB Triumph Trial Juvenile Hurdle at Cheltenham on Saturday for Dan and Harry Skelton.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The three-year-old was very free when winning on his hurdles debut at Warwick and he was keen again at Cheltenham, but he still managed to make all despite that tendency.</p>
      <p>Available at 13/2 on Friday, he returned the 11/4 winner with uneasy favourite Mick Pastor disappointing.</p>
      <p>Sky Bet cut him to 20/1 from 33/1 for the Triumph Hurdle back at Cheltenham at the Festival in March.</p>
      <p>"I thought those tactics were possible but not probable here," said Dan Skelton.</p>

      <p>"If you think he's keen you should see him at home, he's much worse. There was no point running in a Mickey Mouse race and he's hard on himself at home, so we may as well take him to the races.</p>
      <p>"At two they didn't think he was far off Derby standard, but he just got keener and keener. He's bull-headed, but to keep going in those conditions you need to be strong.</p>
      <p>"He's shown us what he can do, so we'll go steady now and treat him with the respect he deserves and we'll aim to come back here in March.</p>
      <p>"I can't see a reason to run much before then, maybe one race before it. If he hasn't boiled over today, I can't see why he would in March.</p>
      <p>"I don't think we will go to Chepstow unless we try to give him something quiet and he doesn't want to have it. I think we will have one run three weeks before the Festival to get a little bit of the fizz out of him."</p>
