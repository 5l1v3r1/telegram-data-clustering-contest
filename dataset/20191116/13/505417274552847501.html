        <b>After a tough opening Ulster lead Bath at The Recreation Ground, thanks to a great individual try from John Cooney who atoned for an error just a minute earlier.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/UlsterRugby">Ulster</a> found themselves under pressure early on as Bath utilised the strong running of Jonathan Joseph and Jamie Roberts but the Ulster defence held strong and managed to turn the home side over right underneath their own posts after the first ten minutes.</p>

      <p>As Ulster looked to exit, John Cooney showed signs of some early nerves when being blocked down as he attempted to box kick.</p>
      <p>However, the scrum-half responded perfectly two minutes later blocking down an opposition kick before running in Ulsterâ€™s first try of their Heineken Champions Cup campaign.</p>
