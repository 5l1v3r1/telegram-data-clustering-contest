      <h1>Sydney is admired by the world but let down by high costs, bad nightlife and lack of narrative</h1>

      <p>Sydney is selling itself short as a destination for global business, entrepreneurs and fun-hungry tourists, and lacks a narrative about itself, according to a major piece of research examining the city's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
      <p>The Committee for Sydney's forthcoming <i>Benchmarking Sydney</i> report finds the city continues to enjoy a positive reputation around the world - especially as a recognised, appealing destination for international students and visitors - but it is let down by its expensiveness, poor nightlife and perceptions of its dining and shopping scenes.</p>

      <p>Sydney is also yet to catch up on its "lost decade or more" following the 2000 Olympics, said Committee for Sydney chief executive Gabriel Metcalf. Today <i>The Sun-Herald</i> begins a series exploring how the city can reclaim and reorient its image in 2020.</p>
      <p>"Sydney's brand is incredibly strong ... but it's hard to get past the image of the beach," Mr Metcalf said.</p>
      <p>"When I show pictures of the CBD, a lot of people in other parts of the world are shocked. Just the visual of the density and energy of what is clearly a global business centre gives people a different story than a picture of Manly."</p>
      <p>This year's benchmark study found that while Sydney remains competitive as centre for finance, it has fallen behind Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok when it comes to the presence of global companies' headquarters, now ranking 27th out of 44 global cities.</p>
      <p>Since 2017, Sydney has also tumbled to 15th from 8th in a KPMG ranking of cities where foreign companies are setting up new job-creating facilities. We are now trailing Dusseldorf, Sao Paulo, Amsterdam and Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The Committee for Sydney said these declines were partly cyclical. But it also found multinational companies have "a relatively lean presence" in Sydney and "do not drive or catalyse as many jobs wider corporate and services economy as in other cities".</p>
      <p>The report found Sydney's labour market was "strained" by the challenges of retaining talent. The city's expense was a key factor, especially when other cities were having "more success" at closing affordability and liveability gaps. While Sydney ranked higher when it came to <i>attracting</i> outside talent, Melbourne did better on the ingredients for <i>keeping</i> it.</p>
      <p>The cost of living in Sydney was also a growing problem for the city's large population of foreign students. The report said affordability was "beginning to act as a brake" on our ability to attract the full spectrum of international students, and Sydney ranks behind Paris, Zurich and Montreal as a destination for them.</p>
      <p>When it came to culture, Sydney under-performed in a range of areas - especially our nightlife, which has started to garner a negative reputation worldwide, according to the research.</p>

      <p>One survey cited by the Committee ranked Sydney equal 26th out of 33 for its "fun rating", on par with Vienna, Vancouver and Seattle - "cities that have previously struggled to capture the global imagination of what it means to be fun".</p>
      <p>Very few international tourists nominated nightlife among their reasons for visiting Sydney, and the number of 15-29 year old tourists increased only 2 per cent last year. Visitors in the 30-39 and 50+ age groups leapt by closer to 6 per cent, according to Destination NSW.</p>
      <p>"Probably the biggest negative perception Sydney faces with its trust brand is that it doesn't have a thriving nightlife," Mr Metcalf said. "That has shown up in international perceptions about Sydney.</p>
      <p>"That is the lockout laws and the eagerness of local councils to shut down music venues over noise complaints and all the other issues with nightlife."</p>
      <p>Once famed as a global LGBTI hotspot, Sydney ranks only 19th on the perceived vibrancy of its LGBTI dating scene and 24th for LGBTI nightlife. That was based on a self-assessment of 2500 residents by apartment aggregator Nestpick, and Melbourne scored higher on every indicator.</p>
      <p>Sydney's other weak spots were the perceived attractiveness of its dining and shopping scenes, as well as its "perceived all-round visitor appeal". Sydney performed better on measurable outcomes such as the number of luxury hotel rooms and the amount international tourists spend per night.</p>
      <p>Despite its shortcomings, Sydney remained the world's second most "admired" city behind Tokyo, according to Reputation Institute research measuring beauty, safety, security and leadership.</p>
      <p>Overall, Sydney ranked 15th out of 33 peer cities selected by the Committee. The city is rated as a "contender" alongside Beijing, Washington and Berlin, but outside the "big seven" of London, New York, Singapore, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul.</p>
      <p>"Sydney got a little behind and is playing catch up right now," Mr Metcalf said. "A big theme throughout this report is that we cannot rest on our laurels."</p>
