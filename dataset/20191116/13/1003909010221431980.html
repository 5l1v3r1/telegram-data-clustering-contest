      <h1>Preview: Actor bears weighty role in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h1>

      <p>Physically and mentally, Bruce Horak is ready for his big role in Alberta Theatre Projects holiday show.</p>
      <p>Along with another actor, Horak will don a puppet costume to play Aslan, the mighty lion king of Narnia in C.S. Lewis’ beloved children’s book, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.</p>
      <p>When ATP artistic director Darcy Evans called Horak to offer him the role, he immediately asked how Evans was going to create Aslan.</p>
      <p>“Darcy was able to borrow the puppet the Stratford Festival created for its production of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. Back in 2000, I played Smaug the Dragon in the Banff production of The Hobbit. That was an impressive puppet, but Aslan is so much more impressive. It has the flavour of the puppets created for productions of War Horse,” says Horak.</p>
      <p>“I am inside the puppet with Jarod Blake and the audience will see us operating the puppet. Our heads are covered but our limbs and bodies are visible. When the puppeteers are really good, they’re forgotten and that’s Jarod’s and my goal. We want people to forget we’re in the puppet.”</p>
      <p>Horak says it’s been challenging for him and Blake to synchronize their movements.</p>
      <p>“Jarod has to follow my lead and that can be tricky. We videotape our scenes and then watch them afterwards so we can pick out what we’re doing right and what we’re doing wrong.”</p>
      <p>Horak has the added responsibility of voicing Aslan, who he says has always been “an otherworldly character. You cannot escape the Christian overtones in Aslan. He’s a deity but, as C.S. Lewis writes him, he can also be quite mischievous.</p>
      <p>“When I was in Grade 4, I listened to an audio book of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. It was an English actor voicing him and years later, I listened to Patrick Stewart’s version and Liam Neeson voiced him in the film, so I have that kind of resonating British voice in my head. I think that’s what audiences expect from Aslan.”</p>
      <p>Horak also plays Father Christmas in the production. “I get a frothy beard and cap but don’t expect the iconic Norman Rockwell Santa Claus.”</p>
      <p>The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe was published in 1950 and became an instant classic. It is the most read of all Lewis’s Narnia books and a staple in libraries around the world. Horak says he understands why it is so beloved.</p>
      <p>“It has all the hallmarks of a great adventure. It takes place in another world that kids enter. They lead the adventure which takes them from innocence to experience. They encounter witches, fantasy creatures and the mythical Aslan himself. There are sword fights and an epic battle between good and evil. It has it all.</p>
      <p>“The beauty of the story is you watch the four siblings learn to support each other which was not the case before they walked through the wardrobe into Narnia. They find strength and trust in each other and that is a great lesson for all of us. When you come down to it, this story is a ripping good yarn and that’s what families look for in stories and entertainment they can share.”</p>
      <p>Horak points out that children’s literature written since The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe have borrowed much from it, such as the Harry Potter books. “They are about an innocent kid who travels to a strange world and becomes a hero.”</p>
      <p>Joining Horak and Blake in the core company of ATP’s production are Lucian-River Chauhan, Annabel Beames, Anna Dalgleish and Daniel Fong as the siblings Edmund, Lucy, Susan and Peter with Kristy Benz, Elinor Holt, Kevin Rothery, David Sklar and Brianna Johnston as the inhabitants of Narnia.</p>
      <p>A children’s choir added to the magic of the show.</p>
