        <b>Track Good 3, with the rail out 3m from 900m to 400m, then True the remainder, so on-pace early before they trend towards the middle and from off the speed.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 1 BM 66 HCP (1410m):</h3>
      <p>Small field, but ultra competitive. Forbes 7YO gelding<b> 1. Caszar </b>is bursting to win after rattling home from the back at Narromine before again finishing late in a deeper race behind a smart galloper this track two weeks ago. Hard fit, and smaller field means won't be anywhere near as far off them at the 400m.</p>

      <p><b>Dangers:</b> Nyngan 6YO mare<b> 4. Lulu's Destiny</b> is third-up and looks the best weighted runner in the race after splitting Caszar and talented Smart Moove in that same race. Will get a charmed run behind the speed, with the blinkers coming off. Mudgee 6YO gelding <b>3. Redirect</b> will improve sharply here after flopping first-up at Scone when unwanted in betting, but this is a shade weaker.</p>

        <b>Race 2 BM 66 HCP (1010m):</b>
      </p>
      <p>Same grade but back to the short course, and this looks a race in two, with both of them scratched from a later race. Local 6YO gelding <b>3. Sons Of Bourke</b> has been a little disappointing in his last two this grade after flying home to score an upset win this track three runs back. Proven weight carrier who draws to get plenty of cover around midfield and still looms as the one to beat.</p>
      <p><b>Dangers:</b> The clear threat is 4YO Wyong gelding<b> 5. Thiswilldous</b> who was immediately spelled and freshened after failing badly resuming at Muswellbrook, but there were excuses being caught wide in the run, and pulling up with cardiac arrhythmia. Draws the fence, and looks ready to hit back winning a recent trial. Canberra 6YO gelding<b> 2. Exaggerate</b> finally got his reward charging home to win a weaker race at home last start, although this company is as tough as he wants.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Race 3 C, G &amp; E MAIDEN HCP (1110m):</h3>
      <p>The boys lock horns now in a very moderate sprint that sets up well for 4YO Muswellbrook gelding<b> 5. Double The Offer </b>who returned off a near year-long break with a terrific closing effort in a thin maiden at Gunnedah despite being held up approaching the turn. Bred to improve over more ground so expect him to be rattling over the top on a suitable spacious track.</p>
      <p><b>Dangers:</b> Narromine 5YO gelding<b> 8. Carnegie's Monaco</b> hasn't quite inherited the finishing ability of his trainer, former Souths and Roosters Rugby League winger Terry Fahey, but only just missed resuming in a weak maiden, and drops a whopping 7kg after rider's full claim. Watch the market closely on 3YO Gulgong gelding and first starter <b>1. Hawklist </b>(Purrealist x Hawkeyed Girl by Strategic) who debuts off two steady trials for smart country stable; while 5YO Scone gelding <b>11. Starring</b> is still trying to break through at 13th start, and resumes without a public trial, but leading jockey hops back on for a strong stable.</p>

      <h3>Race 4 F &amp; M MAIDEN HCP (1110m):</h3>
      <p>Now the girls' turn over the same trip and there's far more depth and chances here. Muswellbrook 4YO mare <b>12. Peggy's Time</b> resumed off a lengthy break with an even effort at home, but she looks well weighted, and only has to reproduce somewhere near her early autumn form against stronger to go very close.</p>
      <p><b>Dangers:</b> Narromine 3YO filly<b> 9. Sue's Girlfriend</b> hit the line nicely at third career run, and draws to get plenty of cover midfield. Expect sharp improvement at second start from 4YO Scone mare <b>2. Wickmo</b> despite drawing off the track. Was well beaten in a stronger maiden on debut, but senior rider goes on. Improving 4YO mare and stablemate to top selection, <b>13. Bush Rambler </b>has had three progressive runs back from a spell in deeper fields, and hit the line nicely at Cessnock last start. Needs a scratching to get a ruin, but this suits. Debutant filly<b> 4. Cheselbeach</b> (Stratum x Rainbow's Edge by Sebring) comes out of that same trial for leading local stable; while expect improvement too from 3YO Wyong filly<b> 5. Amelika</b> who hasn't done much in three runs so far, but this is a drop in quality.</p>

        <b>Odds and Evens: Split</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 5 CL3 HCP (1010m):</h3>
      <p>Good sprint. The handicapper hasn't missed progressive and lightly raced 6YO Nyngan gelding <b>1. Pedway</b> lumping him with 65kg after exploding away to bolt in a BM 66 this track second-up, but he draws well and is used to carrying big weights. Still the clear one to beat.</p>
      <p><b>Dangers:</b> Scone 5YO gelding <b>6. Magic Town</b> is on the quick back-up after fighting on strong at home when very well backed. Local 5YO gelding <b>5. Sipharderson</b> resumes off a forward trial, and loves racing here with a 33 per cent winning strike rate, although normally takes a run or two before showing his best; while 6YO Forbes mare <b>7. Yeas and Nays</b> is ready to peak fourth-up down sharply in weight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Pedway to win and trifecta 1,6/1,5,6/1,5,6,7<br/></b>
        <b>Odds and Evens: Split</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 6 CL1 HCP (1110m):</h3>
      <p>This looks ideal for lightly raced 5YO Scone mare <b>3. Peloso Lass </b>second-up from a good trailing draw. Finished strongly in a good quality Class 1 at Muswellbrook, and has been fairly hard in the market right through her brief, but promising career.</p>
      <p><b>Dangers</b>: Improving 5YO local gelding<b> 1. Adsum</b> has a big finishing motor, and loved the way he attacked the line resuming in this grade. Only missed a place four times from 12 starts, and second-up form is solid. Local 3YO gelding<b> 5. Conspirator</b> is by former UK Group 1 winner Crowded House, and demolished his rivals on debut. This is an obvious jump in class, but bred to get over further, and surely will be finishing hard. Doubt anything else can win.</p>

        <b>How to play it: Peloso Lass to win and box exacta 1,3,5<br/></b>
        <b>Odds and Evens: Odds</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 7 BM 58 HCP (1610m):</h3>
      <p>Open battle to finish, with plenty of hopes. Very forgiving of capable 4YO Nyngan mare<b> 6. Miss Lon</b> who only got going late in a handy BM 58 at Warren seven days ago. Prior form in deeper races was very sound, and leading country jockey going on is a big plus.</p>
      <p><b>Dangers:</b> Gulgong 4YO gelding <b>3. Clever Missile</b> broke through at third start this track, and again draws to get a cosy run on the fence just off the speed in this tougher assignment. Local 7YO mare<b> 4. Oracabessa</b> produced her best run in a long time sweeping home to blitz that BM 58 field at Warren, but goes up 2kg and drawn wider. Mudgee 6YO gelding<b> 1. George Two</b> has had a slow start to this prep across three modest runs, although normally takes a while before hitting top gear. Big weight is crucially off-set with a 3kg claimer aboard, and this is a clear drop in class fourth-up. Another one from the Brett Thompson stable at Gulgong, 5YO gelding <b>13. Dart Street </b>also comes out of that Warren race behind Oracabessa where he was well specked in the market and finished off OK, and while he's still chasing a second win after 23 starts, has been placed 11 times. Local 5YO gelding <b>2. Proudest Moment </b>careered away to win a Class 2 from the front at Forbes two runs back, but looked a little out of his depth up in grade in that same race at Warren.</p>
