      <p>Tema, Nov. 15, GNA – The Tema Regional Office of the Ghana News Agency has been enhanced with the donation of high quality and high performing Crompton Ceiling Fans and Havells Venus Grand LED Flood Lights, by Services Merchandise Limited (SML).  </p>
      <p>Mr Vijay P. Gokaldas, SML Chief Executive Officer who donated the electrical products noted, the need for state institutions and the private sector to work together for national development.</p>
      <p>He said SML, which is a pro-active dealer, providing quality electrical equipment clubbed with top-notch service to both industrial and commercial projects, considered the donation as “our noble venture to supplement the effort of Government and the Management of GNA to make the working condition conducive for staff to give out their best”.</p>
      <p>Mr Gokaldas appealed to Ghanaians to adopt zero tolerance for counterfeit electrical products; as fake goods were death traps and must be avoided for the protection of lives and property.</p>
      <p>He also urged managers of public property to patronise electrical and electronic goods from qualified dealers, stressing that “Ghana must adopt the policy of zero tolerance for fake goods, especially electrical products and electronic appliances”.</p>
      <p>He urged the public to deal with accredited companies and not to take the authenticity of electrical products for granted.</p>
      <p>Mr Francis Ameyibor, GNA Tema Regional Manager who received the products commended the management of SML, which is the main distributors of Havells, Saachi Electric and Crompton Greaves, for the support.</p>
      <p>He noted that it was paramount for institutions to create and maintain a healthy working environment for the staffs, “your working environs has greater reflections on your output. Poor working environs could heighten workplace stress, and fatigue, but cushy office space serves as motivation for workers.</p>
      <p>“If your workers are recalcitrant sometimes, your output is low, and your health bill is up, check the conditionss under which your staff operate. The lighting, ventilations, the type of chairs and tables, general office décor, and other office equipment might be a factor. We must create friendly ambience for staff and visitors alike”.</p>
      <p>Mr Ameyibor, commended the Management of GNA headed by Mr Albert Kofi Owusu and the Board for working around the clock to change the brand of the agency, and called for greater collaboration among workers for outmost results.</p>
      <p>The Tema Regional Manager also stressed the need for strengthened relationship between operators in the private space as well as the public, “we are development partners for mother Ghana.</p>
      <p>“Our overall interest is to help build the nation, we may be using different materials at the Ghana construction site, but in all we work as common stakeholders”.</p>
      <p>Mr Ameyibor called for greater collaboration among national stakeholders, stressing that, “GNA especially the Tema Regional Office is ready as your development partner, call on us, and let’s work together in the interest of mother Ghana”.</p>
