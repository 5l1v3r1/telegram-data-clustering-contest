      <h1>Ballet star Misty Copeland picks up the sword for Sylvia</h1>

      <p>Misty Copeland isn't afraid of a fight. She's taken on poverty, discrimination and prejudice to become one of the world's most famous ballet dancers.</p>
      <p>Now Copeland – the first African American woman to be named a principal of the American Ballet Theatre – is taking the battle centre stage.</p>

      <p>The superstar ballerina is for the first time dancing the role of the sword-slinging, arrow-firing titular warrior in two performances of the Australian Ballet Company's Sydney production of <i>Sylvia</i>.</p>
      <p>There is no shortage of passive female characters who are loved, led, lifted and left in classical ballet productions. But the headstrong nymph Sylvia is the one who offers her hand, who fights instead of being fought over, who protects rather than yearns for protection. Along with Artemis and Psyche, Sylvia is part of a triumvirate of superheroines who lead the rarely staged ballet, which has been choreographed by Stanton Welch in a co-production with the Houston Ballet.</p>
      <p>"It's exciting, especially in this time, to be portraying a powerful woman who is not wooed by a man. She is taking charge," Copeland said.</p>
      <blockquote>It wouldn’t feel I was being true to myself to speak about these things and go on stage and be this depressed slave woman.</blockquote>
      <p>"It's a nice, positive message for young girls and boys to see in this day and age."</p>
      <p>In this day and age, the programs of classical ballet companies are still replete with traditional productions where the representations of women and people of colour are far from empowering. How do you reckon with those roles as a star dancer?</p>

      <p>Copeland, 37, said after a lifetime of performing characters she has found problematic she now refuses to dance certain ballets. When she goes en pointe, she wants to be sure she is making the right point. There are some staple ballets and roles that can be held onto, Copeland said, but others should be let go.</p>
      <p>"It's really challenging being a principal dancer with the climate we are in today but I have the ability and the power to make decisions. I have definitely turned down roles I have danced my whole career that don't really make sense in the time we are living in today," Copeland said.</p>
      <p>Now in a position of influence with a memoir, film credit and an apparel line to her name as well as 1.7 million followers on Instagram, Copeland has been outspoken about the lack of diversity in ballet and the challenges she has faced relating to race, body shape and class.</p>
      <p>"I think at this point, not just because of how it looks or sounds, but for my own peace of mind, it wouldn't feel I was being true to myself to take the stance and speak about these things and go on stage and be this depressed slave woman."</p>

      <p>Becoming a principal dancer, Copeland said, allowed her to see the broader significance ballet can hold and her role in shaping conversations about change. And Sylvia the slayer may just be the most fierce role she has danced yet.</p>
      <p>"We are not in a bubble. The world is watching us. Especially in my position, having so many platforms that reach so many people, it's important for me to represent who I am and what I say, on the stage as well."</p>
