      <p>SEATTLE — U.S. Coast Guard crews hoisted an injured man from a Canadian naval vessel that was in the northern section of Admiralty Inlet.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound command centre in Seattle was notified at 10:30 a.m. Friday that a man aboard the Royal Canadian Navy Ship HMCS Nanaimo had sustained a head injury after a fall. HMCS Nanaimo is based out of Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt.</p>
      <p>The coast guard says the ship crew reported that the man had a laceration on his head and showed signs of a concussion.</p>
      <p>A coast guard helicopter crew conducting training exercises nearby responded and lowered a rescue swimmer onto the ship’s deck.</p>
      <p>The injured man was then put into a basket and hoisted into the helicopter.</p>
      <p>The aircraft transported him to a Seattle hospital where he was then transferred by ambulance to another facility for medical care.</p>
      <p>The patient’s medical condition was not known.</p>
