      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> say they will triple the rate of tree planting in the UK, but the Lib Dems say they can double that.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has announced a £640 million Nature for Climate fund which would see 30 million more trees planted every year – covering 30,000 hectares.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jo-swinson/">Jo Swinson</a>’s party say they will undertake the largest tree planting programme in UK history if they win the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems accused the government of ‘woefully failing to meet their own targets in the past year’.</p>
      <p>The party vowed to plant 60 million more trees ever year if Swinson is given the keys to Number 10.</p>

      <p>Labour said the Conservative Party’s announcement was an attempt by Boris Johnson to ‘greenwash his atrocious environmental record’.</p>

      <p>Former environment secretary Michael Gove said the EU Common Agricultural Policy, which offers financial incentives for farmers, was to blame for the government not meeting its 2015 manifesto pledge to plant another 11 million trees by 2020.</p>
      <p>Gove said more money could be spent on putting trees in the ground once the UK leaves the bloc.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: ‘Across the political spectrum, whether people argued for Leave or Remain, there are very few people who argue that we should maintain the unfair, unjust and un-green Common Agricultural Policy.’</p>
      <p>It is understood the Tories want to plant new forests, supplement existing woodland and plant more trees in urban areas.</p>
      <p>The party’s fund would also be used to restore degraded peatland across the country.</p>
      <p>If elected, the Tories have vowed to launch a £500 million Blue Planet Fund which will be dedicated to marine science and improving conditions for existing fishing crews.</p>
      <p>But the PM’s environmental plans have been dismissed by opposition leaders.</p>

      <p>Swinson said: ‘It’s clear that the Conservative Party doesn’t take climate change seriously.</p>
      <p>‘Only the Liberal Democrats have a radical plan to make a real impact in the fight against climate change and build a brighter future for our planet.’</p>
      <p>Labour’s Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman said her party would be informed by what science says is necessary and possible</p>
