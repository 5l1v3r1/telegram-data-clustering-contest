      <h1>We love a hand-made gift, but here's what your child's teacher wants</h1>

      <p>Santa Claus is coming to town, and, as every parent knows, that “Santa Claus” is actually you. You’re the one making the list and checking it twice, and for many of us, the kids’ teachers are on it.</p>
      <p>Social media parent groups are awash with posts desperately seeking ideas for the illusive ideal teacher gift. As a teacher myself as well as a parent, it is truly heartening to see so many of us wanting to recognise and show appreciation for the work teachers do and the relationship they build with our children.</p>

      <p>I’ve received some beautiful gifts from my students over the years, many of which I keep in my home and treasure. There’s the cake stand one of my students woodworked for me, a mug with a whimsical garden pattern that I still have my coffee in every day, and the framed copy of a poem one of my students wrote about me which still brings me to tears when I read it.</p>
      <p>Then there was a student who filled a jar with slips of paper, one to be unrolled each week for the following year, where she’d written one thing on each paper that she loved about my classes. And, of course, I love homemade shortbread as much as anyone!</p>
      <p>But what teachers and schools really want for Christmas is some real recognition and support.</p>
      <p>Teachers in Australia work some of the longest hours in the profession across the OECD. And they’re getting longer. And we spend far longer on “adminsitrivia” and non-teaching tasks than our <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52evu.html">colleagues in other countries, </a>taking us out of the classrooms we love. We collect and collate endless data and samples to appease the rhetoric about “falling standards” that suggests our schools and our teachers are failing (we’re not, in fact, I see teachers and their students doing amazing things everywhere).</p>

      <p>We work an average of about 45 hours per week, and it’s not uncommon for us to work more than 50, which the <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p51v22.html">Australian Bureau of Statistics considers</a> “very long hours”. Recent research also revealed that we experience both anxiety and depression at <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p51xqq.html">significantly higher rates</a> than the general population). We work in <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p510v6.html">poorly resourced schools and classrooms</a> (which are also often boiling hot) and frequently use<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p50bs5.html"> our own money</a> to buy supplies for our classrooms and food for our students.</p>
      <p>We love our job and we love our students. We love creating lessons and programs that get kids excited about learning, seeing the look on a child’s face when they finally “get it”, watching them grow into smart, funny, kind young people, sharing their joy and triumph, and picking them up when they stumble. It is our great privilege to be a part of your children’s lives. But we are exhausted, and the schools we work in are stretched thin.</p>
      <p>So, this Christmas, if you want to do something great for your child’s school, why not contact the principal and ask them what they need? You could even get the whole class or year group of parents to go in on a gift. Could the school use some new sport equipment or some comfy bean bags for the library? Maybe a data projector?</p>
      <blockquote>We love our job and we love our students. We love ... seeing the look on a child’s face when they finally 'get it'.</blockquote>
      <p>Or would a coffee machine for the staffroom be a good way to recognise and support the work school staff do? Could you buy some whiteboard markers or some craft supplies for the classroom teacher? Those things get expensive over a year!</p>
      <p>Think about offering your time to your school next year, if you can. Could you come in once a month to help with reading or canteen? Help supervise on excursions? Or, could you offer your professional services? Could you print pamphlets or brochures at cost? Or help with the school’s website? Could you help older students write resumes?</p>
      <p>Could you write a letter or phone your local member to remind them that the community supports schools and teachers?</p>

      <p>Add that to some of that homemade shortbread (it’s always so good!) or something handmade by your child, and a heartfelt card, and it’s the perfect way to show teachers that we see and appreciate their work and want to support them.</p>
      <p>That sort of thing makes us feel so energised for our job and for our students. It reminds us that we are lucky enough to have a job that makes us a part of a tight community. It is the embodiment of community spirit, which, really, is the Christmas spirit after all.</p>
