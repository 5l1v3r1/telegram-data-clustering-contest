      <p>This year there is one vacancy for a Member Nominated Director (MND) to join the Co-op Board of Directors.</p>
      <p>Giving members a voice in the boardroom, the role combines overseeing commercial and financial performance with ensuring that Co-op’s unique values and principles are front and centre in everything it does.</p>
      <p>It’s an opportunity for members to join an experienced and high calibre board that is committed to ensuring that one of the world’s largest consumer co-ops continues to deliver on its exciting plans for the future.</p>
      <p>Adrienne Lowe, from the Members’ Council who chairs the joint MND Nominations Committee, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for Co-op members to have their voice heard in the boardroom. Having our members on our board is part of our Co-op difference – it sets us apart from other investor-owned businesses.”</p>
