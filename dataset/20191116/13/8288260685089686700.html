      <p>Conservative Party representative Bill Wiggin will battle for North Herefordshire in the 2019 general election.</p>
      <p>The constituency was held by the Tory two years ago, and this year, Mr Wiggin faces three other candidates.</p>
      <p>He will be up against Joe Wood, from Labour, and Lib Dem representative Phillip Howells.</p>
      <p>Ellie Chowns, from the Green Party, completes the list of four candidates for the constituency, which boasts an electorate of 67,000.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, elections are held every five years to determine which party will head up the British government. However since 2015, this year will be the third time that voters have been called to the ballot box.</p>
      <p>These are the candidates for 2019:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>*Bill Wiggin (C)</p>
      <p>Joe Wood (Lab)</p>
      <p>Phillip Howells (LD)</p>
      <p>Ellie Chowns (Green)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Following the controversial Brexit referendum in 2016, the public has witnessed tiresome debates in Parliament resulting in several failed exit deal suggestions.</p>
      <p>Three-and-a-half years on, we’re still quite a way off deciding what the state of play will be when the UK leaves the European Union. </p>
      <p>At present, Prime Minister, Boris Johnson does not have enough Conservative MPs to pass new laws and approve plans for a Brexit strategy. </p>
      <p>It is hoped the general election on December 12, will amend that.</p>
