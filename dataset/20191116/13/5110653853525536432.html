      <h1>A timeline of AFC North violence: Browns, Steelers add another incident to division's ugly decade</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:45:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Greer</a></address>
      <p>The Browns and Steelers hit a new low for the AFC Northon Thursday night — and that is saying something considering the division's checkered history.</p>
      <p>When Browns defensive end Myles Garrett ripped off Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph's helmet and whipped it at Rudolph's head, he only added to an already long list of brutal incidents. When the Bengals, Browns, Ravens and Steelers take the field for a divisional game, bad things tend to happen.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Old school football fans will surely remember a time when hitsfrom AFC North battles in the2000swere being celebrated on <a href="http://theclassical.org/articles/keep-your-helmet-on-espns-jacked-up-in-retrospect">ESPN's "Jacked Up,"</a>but gradual changestoimprove player safety have done little to decrease the violence. Helmet-to-helmet hits and major injuries are not uncommon when these teams meet.</p>
      <p>The NFL handed down <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garrett-suspension-helmet-swing-browns-steelers-fine/p6a4y3lcs6841h6yyhthae7t2">significant suspensions and fines</a> to everyone involved in the Browns-Steelers debacle. Perhaps those punishments will make players think twice about questionable hits or extracurricular activities. Take a look at the past decade, though, and you'll see this story has played out a similar way before.</p>
      <h3>James Harrison goes helmet-to-helmet on Josh Cribbs, Mohamed Massaquoi (2010)</h3>
      <p>On a first-down play near midfield, Cribbstook the ball out of the Wildcat formation (remember those days?) and ran to the opposite side of Harrison, who continued to pursue the ball. As Cribbs attempted to cut back toward the Steelers' logo, Harrison lowered his helmet and smacked Cribbs in the side of the head.</p>

      <p>Later in that same game, Harrison blew up a defenseless Massaquoion a crossing route. Harrison was later fined $75,000 by the NFL.</p>

      <h3>James Harrison at it again with Colt McCoy (2011)</h3>
      <p>It didn't take long for Harrison to find himself at the center of controversy once again. The Steelers linebacker was flagged for dropping the crown of his helmet into McCoy's facemask and earned a one-game suspension.</p>

      <h3>Josh Cribbs loses his helmet against Ravens (2012)</h3>
      <p>Cribbs was wrapped up down low by Morgan Cox and hit up high by Dannell Ellerbe, sending the Browns return man's helmet flying into the air. Ellerbewas not penalized.</p>
      <p>"I don't remember much about the hit, but after I came up I was ready to play again,"Cribbssaid (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/browns/2012/10/04/cleveland-browns-josh-cribbs-vicious-head-hit/1612481/">via USA Today</a>). "They had to take my helmet and everything for me not play and had to keep tabs on me in the locker room so I wouldn't run back out there. I was ready to play."</p>

      <h3>Terence Garvin breaks Kevin Huber's jaw (2013)</h3>
      <p>Garvin blindsided Huber as the Bengals punter attempted to slow down Antonio Brown on a return. Huber missed the rest of the 2013 season with a broken jaw, and Garvin was fined $25,000.</p>

      <h3>Antonio Brown kicks Spencer Lanning (2014)</h3>
      <p>Instead of simply outrunning Lanningto the sideline, Brown tried to hurdle the Cleveland punter. Brown's leap ended with a cleat to the face for Lanning and a penalty for Brown, who was also fined $8,200.</p>

      <h3>A.J. Green, Tyler Eifert suffer concussions after hit from Mike Mitchell (2014 and 2015)</h3>
      <p>For Bengals fans, the name Mitchell might as well be a curse word. The Steelers safety gave Green a concussion in the 2014 regular season finale, an injury thatalso kept him out of awild-card game. The Bengals ended their season with a 26-10 loss to the Colts.</p>
      <p>Mitchell continued his head-hunting ways the next season with a shot on Eifert, who left the game with a concussion. Mitchell was fined more than $23,000 for hitting a defenseless receiver.</p>

      <h3>Ryan Shazier drills Giovani Bernard (2016)</h3>
      <p>During a 2016 wild-card game, Bernard caught a passfrom AJ McCarronand turned just quickly enough to be face-to-face with Shazier, whowalloped Bernard and forced a fumble. Though it wasn't penalized at the time, Shazier's headshot on Bernard ultimately made the league decide to <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/cincinnati-bengals/post/_/id/21984/ryan-shazier-giovani-bernard-steelers-bengals-nfl-hit-now-illegal-playoffs">outlaw these types of hits</a>.</p>

      <h3>Vontaze Burfict knocks out Antonio Brown (2016)</h3>
      <p>At the end of that same postseason matchup, Burfict, who has his own <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2016/12/18/13351854/vontaze-burfict-history-cincinnati-bengals-asu-personal-fouls">personal history of dirty plays</a>, got called for a personal foul for throwing his shoulder into Brown's head. Referees then flagged Adam "Pacman" Jones during the kerfuffle following Brown's concussion, giving the Steelers an easy field goal attempt for the win. Needless to say, it was <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/bengals-vs-steelers-5-wild-things-that-just-happened-in-terrible-ending-to-steelers-victory/5cdzhhg73u2i1rwwa2t23i8a9/5">a chaotic ending</a>.</p>
      <p>Burfict later <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21653459/vontaze-burfict-cincinnati-bengals-makes-no-apologies-actions-pittsburgh-steelers-anyone-else-nfl">told ESPN</a> he believed Brown "faked" the injury. Brown missed the divisional playoff game the next week, and Burfict received a three-game suspension.</p>

      <h3>Ryan Shazier's spine injury (2017)</h3>
      <p>While Shazier'stackle on Josh Malone is the most normal football play on this list, it is also the most frightening to revisit. The Steelers linebacker couldn't move his legs after his head connected with Malone's ribs.</p>
      <p>He hasn't suited up since that play, but Shazier is still hopeful he will be able to<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-ryan-shazier-eyeing-return-i-still-want-to-make-hall-of-fame/xri6d01ier3r14fjbd33nlibm">return to the field</a>.</p>

      <h3>JuJu Smith-Schuster gets revenge on Vontaze Burfict (2017)</h3>
      <p>This time it's Burfict on the other end of an illegal hit in the same game. Smith-Schuster crackbackblocked Burficton a Le'Veon Bell run and taunted Burfict while he was on the ground, leading to a couple obvious flags.</p>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fOfIObhGMe0" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>During Smith-Schuster's postgame media availability, Brown repeatedly yelled "karma," clearly referencing the 2016 wild-card game. Smith-Schuster, who said he <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamJuJu/status/937921774309621766">didn't mean to hurt Burfict</a>, was suspended one game.</p>

      <h3>Mason Rudolph unconscious after shot from Earl Thomas (2019)</h3>
      <p>On a third-and-long near his own end zone, Rudolph scrambled out of the pocket and found James Washington for a big gain. Rudolph was instantly knocked out by Thomas after throwing the pass, and he had to be helped off the field. Thomas said the hit wasn't intentional, but the NFL ended up giving him a $21,000 fine.</p>

      <h3>JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson leave game after helmet-to-helmet hits (2019)</h3>
      <p>Prior to the Garrett vs. Rudolph melee, multiple Steelers receivers suffered concussions on dangerous plays. Smith-Schuster absorbed multiple hits to the head on a catch over the middle of the field, and Johnson got tagged by Browns cornerback Damarious Randall, who was ejected from the game.</p>

      <h3>Myles Garrett swings helmet at Mason Rudolph (2019)</h3>
      <p>And then arguably the ugliest incident of all. With only seconds remaining and a Browns win secured, Garrett and Rudolph became tangled up on the ground. Rudolph appeared to reach for Garrett's helmet, and Garrett responded by snatching Rudolph's helmet and wildly swinging it at his head.</p>
      <p>Garrett has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL, and the Browns and Steelers have been fined $250,000 each.</p>
