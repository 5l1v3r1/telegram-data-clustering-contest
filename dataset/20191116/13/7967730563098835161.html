      <p>Classic ’80s hits ring through the halls of Melbourne's morgue when Peter Bury works the night shift.</p>
      <p>Donning navy scrubs and knee-high gumboots, the forensic technical officer greets a steady flow of bodies as they arrive.</p>

      <p>He is the keeper of the dead; responsible for a body's first 24 hours inside the coroner’s morgue as pathologists and forensic experts battle the clock to decipher the cause of death for more than 6500 Victorians a year.</p>
      <p>Some of the arrivals might be victims of a violent homicide; others are newborns; some have taken their own lives.</p>
      <p>About 20 arrive every day, and afternoons and evenings are busiest, Mr Bury says.</p>
      <p>“Most cases come in from public areas and houses, and are zipped up inside a bag. Others come in from hospitals and are often wrapped in the sheet they were laying on.</p>
      <p>“We’re the first to touch and see them."</p>
      <p>If the person had agreed to donate their organs or tissue, then the process is time-sensitive.</p>
      <p>“If they’re a donor case, we have 24 hours to take bones and tissues,” he says.</p>
      <p>On his weekends off, Mr Bury indulges a passion he’s had for more than 20 years: professional motorsport photography.</p>
      <p>He has travelled the country to capture Formula One and V8 Supercar racing and has documented the people who rally through the outback in ageing rigs for the Variety Big Bash.</p>

      <p>For more than 25 years, though, the Blackburn father has also taken care of the dead.</p>
      <p>“What's normal for me is confronting for most people,” he says.</p>
      <p>Mr Bury’s career began with exotic zoo and farm animals as a young university graduate in the early 1990s. He began carrying out autopsies on animals that died suddenly, or when the threat of peculiar disease loomed.</p>
      <p>Racehorses in need of blood work and cases of extreme cruelty were among his workload.</p>

      <p>But as outsourcing of theanimal work began, he took a job working with human corpses at Victoria's Coronial Services Centre, home to the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, and the coroner’s office.</p>
      <p>As a university student, Mr Bury was among RMIT’s first intake of medical laboratory science students and was offered hands-on experience at the Institute of Forensic Medicine – a world-leading provider of forensic pathology and scientific services for the coroner and the justice system.</p>
      <p>His first weeks of placement have never left him.</p>
      <p>“I hadn't seen a person who had died before, except for a couple of grandparents in a funeral home as a kid," he says. "It was a bit confronting in the first place.</p>

      <p>“These days you sort of become used to it; you’re less taken by what you see.”</p>
      <p>A walk through Mr Bury’s office is not for the faint-hearted: the air smells wretched.</p>
      <p>In one corner of the windowless morgue lies a CT scanner. To the right is the dissection room. Straight ahead sit large freezers that house bodies that will be returned quickly to their families for burial.</p>
      <p>Down the end of a long, narrow corridor are the homicide rooms where detectives watch as wounds are measured and intricate details logged.</p>

      <p>Upstairs, in the toxicology department, specialist staff are ready to test for 327 different drugs in the first 24 hours.</p>
      <p>In Mr Bury’s department at the Southbank centre, 21 fellow forensic technical officers work a 24-hour roster, scanning new arrivals before taking blood and body fluids for testing.</p>
      <p>About half of the bodies that arrive require a full autopsy to determine the cause of death. While Mr Bury has worked here for more than 13 years, some things still make him squeamish.</p>
      <p>“None of us like dealing with decomposed cases; we all take it in turns with who’s dealing with those,” he says.</p>
      <p>“We probably get three or four a week, though we have quite a variety. Some come in as skeletal remains while others are maybe seven days to a couple of weeks old.”</p>
      <p>In 2014 the Institute of Forensic Medicine received worldwide recognition for its work on the MH17 Malaysia Airlines disaster after the plane broke up mid-air on the Ukraine-Russia border, killing all on board.</p>
      <p>Victorian coronial staff were dispatched to Amsterdam where they helped in the recovery of the 298 dead and brought the bodies of Australian victims home.</p>
      <p>Back in Melbourne, institute employees identified the remains of some 30 Australian victims whose bodies were then released to their families for burial within 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Staff have also helped piece together some of the state’s most harrowing deaths, including the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires and the Bourke Street attack in January 2017.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the recent launch of the institute's <a href="https://www.vifm.org/media-and-events/vifm-web-series/">behind-the-scenes web series, <i>Afterlife</i></a>, Attorney-General Jill Hennessy said the centre was vital to gain a better understanding of how and why a person had died and what that might mean for prevention .</p>
      <p>“Translating the dead to the living - that’s a pretty spectacular thing,” Ms Hennessy said.</p>
      <p>Mr Bury is yet to tell his children exactly what he does for work, but his friends and family are no longer as squeamish as they were.</p>
      <p>And tTe irony of his surname isn’t lost on him either; and his dark humour is a welcome addition to mortuary life.</p>
