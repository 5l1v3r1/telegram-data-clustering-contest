        <b>After House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) took time out of today’s impeachment testimony to rebuke President Trump for “witness intimidation,” President Trump hit back.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During testimony from former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Trump took aim at her over Twitter, saying “<b>Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad</b>. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her…”</p>

      <p>Following Trump’s tweet, Schiff dramatically interrupted questioning from his staff counsel to read Trump’s tweet aloud – asking Yovanovitch what effect Trump’s tweet might have on future witnesses, to which she replied that it would be “very intimidating.</p>
      <p>Trump’s tweet was so troubling that former Media Matters employee Paul Waldman wrote in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/15/yovanovitch-hearing-confirms-that-trump-is-running-thugocracy/"><i>Washington Post</i></a> that Trump “talks and acts like a Mafioso” in an article entitled “Yovanovitch hearing confirms that <b>Trump is running a thugocracy</b>.”</p>

      <p>Following Schiff’s dramatic exchange, Trump was asked whether his words can be intimidating, to which he said “I don’t think so at all.”</p>
      <p>“<b>I have the right to speak. I have freedom of speech just like other people do</b>,” Trump told White House reporters following remarks on a health care initiative, adding that he’s “allowed to speak up” and defend himself.</p>
