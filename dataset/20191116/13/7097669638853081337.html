      <p>Sens. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-elizabeth-warren-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Elizabeth Warren</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Bernie Sanders</a> have a lot in common.</p>
      <p>The two presidential candidates want universal healthcare through a single-payer program, significantly higher taxers on the wealthiest Americans, and the elimination of a vast majority — if not all — of Americans' student debt, among other progressive policies. </p>
      <p>About two-thirds of Sanders' supporters say they'd support Warren if she's ultimately the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-supporters-would-support-elizabeth-warren-2019-11?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">according to recent Insider polling</a>. Although Sanders' base tends to skew more working-class than Warren's, which is disproportionately made up of white Americans with college degrees.</p>
      <p>But the two most progressive candidates in the 2020 Democratic primary have some divergent ideas about how to tackle certain policies and describe themselves as different kinds of reformers. </p>
      <p>Sanders and Warren, who are longtime friends and allies, have fundamentally different views on capitalism and diverging approaches to politics. While Sanders is a democratic socialist calling for a "political revolution," Warren calls herself "a capitalist to my bones" calling for big, structural change. </p>
      <p>And while Sanders' allies say he's the only candidate pushing for "<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/10/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-differences-2020-presidential-campaign">systemic transformation</a>" of American society, Warren's supporters say she's the best-equipped progressive to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/27/warren-sanders-are-similar-only-one-seems-know-what-itll-take-win/">get things done</a> in Washington.</p>
      <p>There's been much <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/10/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-differences-2020-presidential-campaign">punditry</a> on the philosophical and <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/the-overlooked-difference-between-bernie-sanders-and-elizabeth-warren/">tactical</a> <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/815282/where-elizabeth-warren-differs-from-bernie-sanders">differences</a> between the two candidates. But when it comes down to their policy proposals, here are some areas where they differ.</p>
