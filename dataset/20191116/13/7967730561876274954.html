      <h1>'I’m not going to please everyone': Mayor bats away questions about his property interests</h1>

      <p>Sutherland Shire mayor Carmelo Pesce has a simple answer to critics who claim he is too close to developers.</p>
      <p>"When I became mayor, I didn’t even know a developer - not one," he said. "But in the role of mayor I meet all ratepayers."</p>

      <p>In 2013 <i>The</i> <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-2u7x3.html">named Cr Pesce and fellow Liberal Hassan Awada</a> as "lucky Liberals" who had benefited from zoning changes implemented by then Liberal mayor Kent Johns, who remains a Sutherland Shire councillor.</p>
      <p>Since becoming mayor in 2015, Cr Pesce has contended with concern about his property interests. But Cr Pesce said there was a misconception he owned a building company: "I own a shopfitting business. I fit out women's clothing stores. I fit out art stores. I fit out restaurants and offices."</p>
      <p>Cr Pesce said he owned a "diversity of properties" within Sutherland Shire as well as a rural property on the NSW south coast and a shop in Padstow.</p>
      <p>"I don't have a big super fund,” he said. "My father taught me and believed that the best investment you can have is bricks and mortar. That's my retirement and that's something I'll pass down to my kids when I pass on."</p>
      <p>Asked how many properties he owned, Cr Pesce said: "Maybe half a dozen, a dozen."</p>
      <p>He also owns three outlets of Bianchini's Espresso at Gymea, Cronulla Beach and the Elouera Surf Life Saving Club. Cr Pesce won the public tender conducted by the club in 2017 after the first choice for cafe operator dropped out.</p>
      <p>Labor councillor <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-gr9tfv.html">Ray Plibersek</a> - who is Tanya Plibersek's older brother - said the "average Shire ratepayer" would be surprised if any councillor who owned several properties did not declare a conflict of interest and withdraw from debates and decisions about zoning and developments.</p>
      <p>"In most meetings, the mayor will stay and continue to chair council meetings where development or commercial property issues are discussed or decided," he said.</p>
      <p>Cr Plibersek said councillors had to make their own judgment about conflicts of interest under the code of conduct and "there is no right or wrong answer".</p>
      <p>Cr Pesce said he would step out if any conflicts of interst arise, but he pointed out that councillors, including himself, no longer determined development applications.</p>
      <p>"A mayor today is the spokesman of the council and chairs the meetings," he said. "He is the face of the council. I, alone, do not make decisions. We do it collaboratively."</p>
      <p>He said his council had delivered a number of infrastructure projects, including the award-winning Woolooware Bay Shared Pathway, and was developing a plan to revive Cronulla's ailing shopping precinct.</p>
      <p>Development aside, Cr Pesce's tenure as mayor has been colourful. He was threatened by a disgruntled ratepayer, hit by a drunk driver and subjected to an <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p50jra.html">expletive-laden rant last year</a> by fellow Liberal Craig Kelly, the federal member for Hughes.</p>
      <p>Yet the duo were together last weekend opening a World War One memorial in Sutherland, and Cr Pesce praised Mr Kelly as a "great MP".</p>
      <p>Mr Kelly said politics was sometimes a contact sport. "You put put these things behind you and get on doing the job," he added.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Cr Pesce's relationship with Mr Kelly's "hard-nosed" office manager Frank Zumbo has not been mended following an altercation at the council chambers last year.</p>

      <p>Cr Pesce said he asked Mr Zumbo not to attend gatherings in his office after other councillors expressed "discomfort" with his presence.</p>
      <p>"I think he was taken back that I approached him," he said. "To just walk up and just say that to him, he didn't expect it."</p>
      <p>Local newspaper <i>The Leader</i> <a href="https://www.theleader.com.au/story/5432955/update-gm-silent-on-mayoral-suite-incident/">described the encounter</a> as a "heated argument" triggered by the preselection row for Mr Kelly's seat. Cr Pesce called the dispute "done and dusted", but Mr Zumbo said: "I will say since then we have not spoken and it's probably best that I say no more."</p>
      <p>Cr Pesce said he dedicated about 60 hours a week to his mayoral duties, attending up to six events a day "and that flows into the weekend as well".</p>
      <p>He did not rule out a future in state or federal politics, and has not decided whether to run for council again next year.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to please everyone," he said. "But as long as I try my best for the community and try to have a great outcome for the area, I think I've done a good job."</p>
