      <p>Two disabled brothers from Derby starred in BBC Children in Need last night.</p>
      <p>Twins <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/derby-twins-13-make-desperate-1956500">Sam and Alex Bolton</a> appeared in a four-minute feature on the annual fundraiser to raise awareness of Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People.</p>
      <p>The moving video can be viewed above.</p>
      <p>It begins with an introduction that describes the duo as "remarkable".</p>
      <p>The 14 year olds, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/littleover">from Littleover</a>, have been receiving care at the hospice since they were three.</p>
      <p>The teenagers were diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, a muscle wasting disease, when they were just babies.</p>
      <p>And although it is now everyday life, nothing prepared mum Sarah Wilson for receiving the earth-shattering news.</p>
      <p>She said: “My boys aren't just living with spinal muscular atrophy, they're surviving it.</p>

      <p>“They'll never be able to walk and I can't change that, but making their lives busy, fun and fulfilled is what is important to me.</p>
      <p>“We have so much fun and the boys have done some wonderful things.</p>
      <p>“We were honoured to appear on Children in Need and as ever, I am so proud of my boys.”</p>
      <p>The City of Derby Academy pupils are no strangers to TV fame, having once starred in Eat Well for Less.</p>
      <p>Sam said: “I really look forward to going to Rainbows and it's great to be able to give our mum a break."</p>
      <p>At Rainbows, the boys make the most of the facilities including the hydrotherapy pool, music room and arts and crafts room.</p>
      <p>Staff say they can often be found racing around the corridors in their wheelchairs or playing hide and seek.</p>
      <p>The hospice has provided them with many opportunities, including meeting One Direction and David Walliams, who described them as “a pair of comedians”.</p>

      <p>Alex added: “I love Rainbows and everyone there is so nice. We have so much fun.”</p>
      <p>Jo Sims, Head of family support at Rainbows, said: “We completely rely on our supporters to help make the hospice the special place it is.</p>
      <p>“To be able to showcase the work we do on such a prestigious platform is wonderful for us.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank Sam, Alex and Sarah for sharing their story and helping us to support more families.”</p>
