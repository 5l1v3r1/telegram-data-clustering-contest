      <h1>Assist Police to combat crime – Divisional Commander </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:38:46+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Gideon Assinu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Ada, (GAR) Nov. 15, GNA - Chief Superintendent George Andrew Kumah, Ada Divisional Commander of the Ghana Police Service has appealed to Ghanaians to assist police in their effort to combat crime and provide security.</p>
      <p>He said without effective collaboration with the people, work could be jeopardized; “most often especially when we are gathering intelligence, we are handicapped without citizens volunteering information.”</p>
      <p>Chief Supt. Kumah was speaking to the Ghana News Agency in an interview at Kasseh near Ada after an Identification parade was conducted to strengthen Police/Civilian relationship for a safe environment.</p>
      <p>Five suspected armed-robbers who were remanded in police cell by a Tema Circuit Court were put on the identification parade.</p>
      <p>“The criminals live in the communities, and our homes we know them so we must be bold to report suspected anti-social activities of the people.”</p>
      <p>According to Chief Supt. Kumah, most of the complainants who assisted the police leading to the arrest of the criminals were duly informed about the identification parade, but some of them failed to show up.</p>
      <p>“We need you to help us to identify criminals who might have attacked you, all people you suspected to be engaging in criminal activities, if you fail to help to identify you may be supporting criminal activities unconsciously,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Tema Regional Police Commander DCOP Mr John Oyirifi Aknyi has paid a working visit to Ada Divisional command, met some members of Ada Traditional Council at the residence of Ada Paramount Chief Djetser Nene Kabu Akuaku III.</p>
      <p>The Tema Regional Police Command and the Ada Traditional Authority discussed issues bordering on security, crime combat, increase in Police Patrol and Rapid Response during emergencies, logistical provision among other.</p>
      <p>The Ada Manklalo Nene Agudey Obi kyire I who chaired the discussion urged the Police to fast track their response to emergency calls and appealed for a Joint Police/Military Patrols in the areas to combat crime within Ada Divisional command.</p>
