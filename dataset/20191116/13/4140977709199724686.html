            <b>Worst released player of all IPL teams: The SportsRush present before you one name from each team which shouldn’t have been released.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Eight Indian Premier League franchises <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/ipl-2020-released-players-list-which-players-have-been-released-by-ipl-teams-ahead-of-ipl-2020-auction/">released</a> as many as 67 cricketers yesterday ahead of the <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/ipl-2020-auction-date-what-is-the-amount-of-money-left-with-each-ipl-franchise/">IPL 2020 auction</a>. This list including some quality players means that the auction next month will be worth watching.</p>
          <p>While Chennai Super Kings and SunRisers Hyderabad have released five players each, the likes of Royal Challengers Bangalore and Rajasthan Royals have released as many as 11 and 12 players respectively.</p>

                <p>Considering the performances of some players in IPL 2019, it was difficult for them to be retained for IPL 2020. Having said that, franchises have surprisingly also released some players who had done well in the last season.</p>
                <h3>Worst released player of all IPL teams</h3>
                <h4>Kolkata Knight Riders</h4>
                <p>Kolkata Knight Riders baffled one and all on the back of releasing opening batsman Chris Lynn. The 29-year old Australian players is among the most sought-after T20 batsmen around the world.</p>
                <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147">
                  <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142">
                    <anchor name="div-gpt-ad-ATD-TS-RES6">
                      <p>It is worth mentioning that Lynn was Knight Riders’ second-highest run-scorer in IPL 2019. In 13 matches, Lynn had scored 405 runs at an average of 31.15 and a strike rate of 139.65 including four half-centuries.</p>
                      <p>Talking of current form, Lynn was the fourth-highest run-scorer in the recently concluded Global T20 Canada. The 29-year old had scored 295 runs in seven matches at an average of 42.14 and a strike rate of 186.70 including a couple of half-centuries.</p>

                        <anchor name="div-gpt-ad-ATD-TS-RES7">
                          <p>Having bought Lynn for a whopping INR 9+ crore in the auction, Knight Riders might be looking to again buy Lynn at a lesser price.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <h4>Kings XI Punjab</h4>
                            <p>Among the seven players that Kings XI Punjab have released includes England all-rounder Sam Curran. The southpaw has scored runs at an average of 23.75 and a strike rate of 172.72 including a half-century in eight innings.</p>

                            </figure>
                            <p>With the ball in hand, the 21-year old cricketer dismissed 10 batsmen in nine matches at an average of 32.30, an economy rate of 9.78 and a strike rate of 19.80 including a <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/sam-curran-hattrick-twitter-reactions-on-england-star-helping-kxip-beat-dc/">match-winning hat-trick</a>.</p>
                            <p>Whenever Curran was promoted in T20s by Punjab and Surrey, he stood tall on his potential. Also playing T20Is for England these days, Curran could have been an impact-generating player for KXIP in IPL 2020.</p>
