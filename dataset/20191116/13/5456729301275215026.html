      <h1>Bill Gates returns as world's richest man</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:08:13+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/363481-bill-gates-returns-as-worlds-richest-man.html" target="_blank">Samuel Ogundipe</a></address>
      <p>Bill Gates, a foremost philanthropist who co-founded Microsoft, has returned this year as the world’s richest man.</p>
      <p>The latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index said Mr Gates, 64, now has $110 billion, deposing Amazon billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, into second place at $109 billion.</p>
      <p>Bernard Arnault of Louis Vuitton luxury brand came third at $103 billion while Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg was fifth at $74.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Mr Gates’ income was propelled by his Microsoft stocks, which went up 48 per cent in 2019. The company also secured a $10 billion defence contract for cloud infrastructure from the United States government.</p>
      <p>But Mr Bezos’ Amazon posted a lacklustre result in the third quarter of 2019, which saw the founder lose nearly $7 billion in his stock value, reports said.</p>
      <p>Mr Bezos had ended Mr Gates’ 24-year run as the richest man in 2018 when he was reportedly worth $160 billion.</p>
      <p>The Amazon founder also had an infamous divorce that was finalised earlier this year, which saw his then wife, MacKenzie Bezos, walk away with $36 billion from Mr Bezos’ stocks. It was reported as the biggest divorce settlement in history.</p>
