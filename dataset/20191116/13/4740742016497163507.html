      <h1>Star and Garter owner announces 'exciting new plans' for the pub</h1>
      <h2>He is currently applying for a premises license for Albany Green</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:05:04+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rema Mukena</a></address>
      <p>Its previous landlord was a Bristol legend, it had icons <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/star-and-garter-reopening-pictures-2932491">like Dave Chappelle</a> and Damian Marley at its opening, and now it’s going to start serving up the ‘best Jamaican patties in Bristol’. <br/><br/>The Star and Garter is perhaps one of Bristol’s most iconic pubs. Run by Dutty Ken for 24 years, it’s a focal point for the community.  <br/><br/>It closed a year after his death, prompting a community bid to save it. Then, at the end of 2018, it was revealed Malcolm Haynes was going to take over its reigns. <br/><br/>Malcolm is a big name in the music scene, having worked booking acts for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/glastonbury-festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> since the 1990s, but now the Star and Garter has become something of his baby - and despite the success he’s already had with it, he’s got some big plans.</p>
      <p>The Star and Garter reopened with a bang in June. Not just hundreds, but thousands of people turned up to celebrate the iconic pub reopening. <br/><br/>Something of an impromptu festival was held, with the likes of Damian Marley and Roni Size all making appearances.  <br/><br/>When asked about Dave Chappelle’s appearance on the meat raffle, Malcom said: “It’s not about what you know. It’s about who you know.” <br/><br/>But despite the success he’s had since taking over the reigns, it wasn’t an easy process for Malcolm to get behind the bar in the Star and Garter. There were multiple plans for the business and more than one person willing to take it on.</p>

      <p>He told Bristol Live: “It was a little bit of a battle when I wanted to take ownership of the pub because there were other people willing to pay more money for it. <br/><br/>“But, I think I won the case because I knew the family and I knew Ken’s daughters. They're like my family. <br/><br/>“So, although, they were offered more money for this building, I convinced them that I was the right person."<br/><br/>The Star and Garter was previously under the ownership of Bristol legend, community leader and DJ Dutty Ken, as known as Louis Joseph Hayles.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/tributes-bristol-landlord-legend-dutty-411">When he suddenly passed away in 2017 at his home</a>, the Star and Garter, mourning took hold of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/montpelier">Montpelier</a>, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/st-pauls">St Paul's</a> and beyond. </p>
      <p>He would have celebrated his 77th birthday the month after him passing away. <br/><br/>Dutty Ken was the catalyst for transforming the pub, as well as the area around it, with pure charm and charisma. <br/><br/>After receiving a hefty tax bill a couple of years ago, the entire city joined forces and crowdfunded an appeal to save the pub from closure and also to ensure he remained the landlord. <br/><br/>The closure of the pub after his death saddened the community, so when there were talks of the pub being reopened there was a silver lining. </p>
      <h3>'I haven't even started'</h3>
      <p>Malcolm now wants to keep the pub close to those roots of community. He wants to reignite a love for bingo in the West Indian community, start a monthly quiz based on Bristol history and support young people in the community. <br/><br/>“To be honest I haven't finished. Do you know what? I haven't even started,” Malcolm said.</p>
      <p>If you’re a fan of warm, hearty dishes, you’ll be glad to know the wheels are in motion for pub to start serving food at the beginning of December. <br/><br/>Malcolm said: “I've got a kitchen downstairs which we didn't have time to get done and get it finished (when the pub first opened). But we've been working on it and we're hoping to have it done by the end of the month, so then we can serve food on a daily basis.”</p>

      <p>Malcolm wants to be known for serving the best Jamaican patties in Bristol. <br/><br/>Patties are a flattened, usually round, serving of ground meat or vegetables in a pastry and all of the ones the Star and Garter serves up will be homemade, with fresh local ingredients. <br/><br/>“I want people to come in after work or early evening, where they can have it with a dollop of coleslaw and it feels like a meal.  <br/><br/>“We're going to start making our own. In the past six months we've been hearing in the community: 'We want patties. We want patties.'<br/><br/>“I've had a few people turn up to give samples of their patties and they've not been very good, but my daughter's back from Ibiza now and she said: 'Dad, maybe we should do our patties ourselves’.</p>
      <p>“The idea is that I want to sell four or five recipes of patties, like beef and cheese, beef and jerk chicken, a vegetarian one and a vegan one. So, that's something I'd like to get going by the start of next month hopefully."</p>
      <p>Malcolm said he wants to start an open mic night at the pub, as well as a quiz night. <br/><br/>He said: “We're also hoping to start a regular quiz night based on local history. So, how much do you know about Bristol? How much do you know about the black diaspora in Bristol?  <br/><br/>“So, then we're gonna incorporate it with a little music round as well. It's going to be monthly and local-based information and a little bit about black culture. I'm hoping to do the first one on November 26. We want to do one just before Christmas, too.</p>

      <p>“Another plan is starting a monthly bingo night which we’d like to kick off in the first week of December. In the West Indian community, bingo was a big thing for them in the 50s, 60s and 70s.  <br/><br/>“Grantly, who is Clive Smith's from Massive Attack’s dad, actually won the bingo back in the 70s.” <br/><br/>Clive Smith’s partner, Sylvia, has also been heavily involved in the running of the pub. Malcolm said: “She did all the decor, collected all the art work, connected with the community such as Roni Size, George and Clive Smith. So, she did a lot of the engagement."<br/><br/>Malcolm is also passionate about supporting young people in St Paul's and Montpelier.  <br/><br/>He said: “I formed a steering group because we were looking at engaging with the younger kids, but it's not going very well, so what I'm looking at doing is creating a community interest company and just running it like a business but it’ll be to help the community. I imagine that will begin in the new year.”</p>
      <h3>'I've got exciting plans for next year'</h3>
      <p>Malcolm is also applying for a premises licence for Albany Green, a piece of land next to the pub, so he can host around six events a year without having to apply for a licence each time. <br/><br/>The re-opening of the Star and Garter has been a huge success and it seems the best may be yet to come.</p>
      <p>Malcolm said: “I've got exciting plans for next year. I'm not ready to reveal what, but we’ll certainly plan to have another great day like we did for the opening. I think that's something that hopefully we'll do annually. <br/><br/>“We're definitely going to do an event on June 1, or the Saturday closest, to celebrate the reopening. We'll definitely do the bonfire night like we did this year because that was such a big success that caught us off guard.”</p>
