      <h1>“Let’s encourage Marginalised groups in local governance” - TEPPCON </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:25:46+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Emmanuel Gamson, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tamale, Nov. 15, GNA – The Tamale Ecclesiastical Province Pastoral Conference (TEPPCON), has said marginalised groups, including; youth, women and Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) must be encouraged to participate in local governance to value their inputs and bridge the development gaps.</p>
      <p>The TEPPCON said, low participation of the groups in the decision-making processes, and their inabilities to demand accountability from duty bearers were contributing factors to under-development in the country.</p>
      <p>Madam Agnes Gandaa, Executive Secretary of TEPPCON, therefore stressed the need for the marginalised groups to be empowered to participate in local governance.</p>
      <p>Madam Gandaa was speaking at a Town Hall Meeting organised for vulnerable groups and some duty bearers in the Tamale Metropolis, in line with TEPPCON’s initiative to promote participatory governance at the local level.</p>
      <p>The meeting was part of a project being implemented by TEPPCON with funding support from Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), a German Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), and dubbed; “Strengthening citizen participation in local governance in the Tamale Ecclesiastical Province”.</p>
      <p>It created a platform for dialogue between local government authorities and marginalised groups, and brought together youth groups, women groups, Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) and officials from the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development, National Youth Authority (NYA), Department of Gender, National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE) as well as the Electoral Commission (EC).</p>
      <p>Madam Gandaa explained that the project sought to address the low involvement of vulnerable groups in decision-making and said it was being implemented in 10 selected districts within the five dioceses of the Catholic Church in Northern Ghana, including; Tamale, Yendi, Damango, Wa and the Navrongo-Bolgatanga dioceses.</p>
      <p>She said “low or weak citizen participation in decision-making on development worsened by inadequate citizen awareness and the capacity to demand accountability from political and administrative leaderships were some underlying causes of the low development in northern Ghana”.</p>
      <p>She emphasised that the project would strengthen the capacities of citizens, especially marginalised groups to participate in local governance and demand accountability from political and administrative leaders to accelerate development.</p>
      <p>Mr Alfred Ndago, Chairman of TEPPCON, expressed worry about how the marginalised were left out in the decision-making processes, adding that their opinions were not considered in policy formulation.</p>
      <p>He reiterated, the Catholic Church’s commitment to contribute to promoting good governance, peace and justice and development, for the wellbeing of citizens.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Abdul Razak Saani, the Northern Regional Director of the NCCE, educating members of the the public on the upcoming referendum on December 17, 2019, explained that it was not for the election of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) but, seeking the inputs from Ghanaians to amend article 55 (3) to allow district level elections to be conducted on partisan basis.</p>
      <p>Mr Francis Owiredu, an Official of the Northern Region Office of the EC, gave the assurance that his outfit was prepared to conduct the upcoming District Level Elections (DLEs) and referendum.</p>
      <p>He schooled the participants on how the referendum ballot sheets would look like and said a “Yellow colour” would mean “Yes” vote and a “Brown colour” would mean a “No” vote on the ballot sheet.</p>
