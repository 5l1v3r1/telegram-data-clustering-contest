      <h1>Tim Tebow Calls For Alabama To Not Play QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:53:29+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Before another weekend of college football action kicks off, a former star quarterback is calling for one top-ranked program to sit their starting quarterback.</p>
      <p>Former Heisman-winner Tim Tebow suggested Alabama should not play Tua Tagovailoa.</p>
      <p>Tua, who played last weekend in a limited capacity against LSU, is recovering from an ankle injury. While he played last weekend, it was clear he wasn’t at 100-percent – he even said after the game that he played on one foot.</p>
      <p>Tebow thinks Nick Saban should sit Tua and get him healthy for the final regular season game against Auburn.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Tua-Tagovailoa-Alabama-Crimson-Tide-football-Tim-Tebow-ankle-Mississippi-State-Auburn-Tigers-138653971/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“They should totally be considering (sitting him) until (Auburn). More so than giving him rest, college football is a beauty pageant. Alabama needs to do everything they can to say, ‘You know what? We barely lost to LSU and we had to sit Tua the next week because he had a hurt ankle and he couldn’t be back for two more weeks until the Iron Bowl.’<br/><br/>“I think that would be the wisest thing, to sit this young man. You know he’s going to come back healthy and ready to go. Plus, the committee will say he was so hurt against LSU, he couldn’t play the next week. You know (Nick) Saban is thinking about it too.”</blockquote>
      <p>Sitting Tua would be nice, but Alabama needs style points if the Tide want to make the College Football Playoff this season. That means winning by as much as possible over the next three games.</p>
      <p>Tua under center gives the Tide the best chance to win, and win handily.</p>
      <p>Alabama faces off against Mississippi State this afternoon.</p>
