      <p>This year’s fundraiser in aid of the Jersey Christmas Appeal will be launched on Monday 25 November, with a two-week online build-up ahead of the auction itself.</p>
      <p>A tempting and varied range of items and experiences are set to go under the hammer, but there are currently fewer lots than in previous years, prompting an appeal from organisers.</p>
      <p>The usual number of lots at the auction is approximately 200, meaning that around 80 are still required for the 2019 auction.</p>
      <p>Co-organiser Annette Blanchet said: ‘In previous years we didn’t need to collect all the lots until the beginning of December, but now that we launch online, our deadlines are much earlier.</p>
      <p>‘Having an online presence has become a big part of the auction’s success, because it enables people to see the lots in detail and to bid for two weeks prior to the radio broadcast.’</p>
      <p>The auction will be hosted by co-organiser Fiona Walker and DJ Peter Mac and broadcast live on Channel 103 on Sunday 8 December.</p>
      <p>Mrs Walker said lots donated so far included beauty, health and fitness sessions, overnight stays in hotels and meals in local restaurants, wine, flowers, hampers, dog boarding and a week’s use of an apartment in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve been overwhelmed by the generosity of Islanders,’ she said. ‘Every year we wonder whether we will be able to source the number of lots needed to make the auction a success, and although they are slow in coming in this time, we are still hopeful that we’ll reach our target.’</p>
      <p>The auction also features a number of luxury lots, which this year include a £1,000 supermarket dash, the chance to dine like a lord in the House of Lords and a weekend in the Minquiers.</p>
      <p>There will also be a chance to ‘Pledge Your Wedge’, which offers participants the opportunity to win a luxury holiday. Donations are made in multiples – or ‘wedges’ – of £10. Each wedge offers one chance to win a holiday, with the destination selected according to the amount of money raised. Prize trips in previous years have included Mauritius, South Africa and the Maldives.</p>
      <p>Funds raised by the Jersey Christmas Appeal are used to provide food, toy vouchers and hampers for local families needing assistance during the festive season, and also enable fuel vouchers to be provided to elderly Islanders throughout the winter.</p>
      <p>Anyone wishing to donate, contribute or sponsor a lot should contact either Annette Blanchet by emailing ablanchet@jerseyeveningpost.com or Fiona Walker at fionawalkerjsy@gmail.com. The auction will be launched online at jerseychristmasappeal.je on 25 November.</p>
