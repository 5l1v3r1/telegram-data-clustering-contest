      <p>Kanye West has been taking his famed Sunday Services on the road, and his latest stops have been two Texas prisons.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/11/15/kanye-west-choir-visit-harris-county-jail-inmates/">Houston’s CBS affiliate reports</a>, Yeezy performed secret shows at Houston’s Harris County Jail and the Baker Street Jail.</p>
      <p>“In secret from the public, the star rapper-turned-gospel singer performed songs Friday from his new gospel album <i>Jesus is King</i>,” stated Houston’s CBSDFW. “He and his choir performed for more than 200 male inmates at one jail facility before crossing the street to another jail facility and performing for a smaller crowd of female inmates.”</p>

      <p>According to a tweet from Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, West said, “This is a mission, not a show.”</p>

      <p>West appears to be following the lead set by wife Kim Kardashian, who’s spent the past year calling for prison reform and engineering the freedom of prisoners such as Alice Johnson, who had been serving a life sentence without parole for a non-violent drug offence.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, West will be playing for a far bigger audience on Sunday, Nov. 17 when he takes his Sunday Service to televangelist Joel Osteen’s Houston mega-church, where he’s set to perform for the 45,000-member congregation and be seen by an estimated 10 million TV viewers.</p>
