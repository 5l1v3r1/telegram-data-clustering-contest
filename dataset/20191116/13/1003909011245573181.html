      <h1>Brooks: Business leaders inducted into Hall of Fame</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:00:52+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Brooks, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The who’s who in Calgary’s business community gathered at the Hyatt Regency Oct. 24 to honour four individuals inducted into the Alberta Business Hall of Fame. The JA Southern Alberta hosted event proved the perfect opportunity to thank these outstanding business leaders for their time, treasure and inspiration. Inductees this night included Marg Southern, Jay Westman, Geoff Cumming, and Suzanne West (posthumously).</p>
      <p>Southern is perhaps best known for building — with her husband Ron — internationally renowned Spruce Meadows. She has received numerous awards and recognitions including one of Canada’s highest awards — the Companion of the Order of Canada.</p>
      <p>Westman, chairman and CEO of Jayman Built and JWI Investments, has transformed the new homes industry. Under his leadership, Jayman has been awarded Builder of the Year 16 times and, since its founding in 1980, is considered the No. 1 single-family builder in Calgary for 31 of the 39 years. Further, his company and his charitable foundation has donated or raised millions of dollars for myriad not-for-profits as well as $5 million to the University of Calgary, Westman Centre for Real Estate Studies.</p>
      <p>International businessman and philanthropist Geoff Cumming made one of the largest donations ever in Canada by gifting $100 million towards long-term medical research at the University of Calgary. He founded — and continues to fund — The Ryman Prize, a global, $250,000-prize annually awarded to advancements that positively impact quality of life for the elderly.</p>
      <p>Businesswoman Suzanne West’s list of accomplishments are impressive. Not only did she start her own oil and gas company — Touchstone Petroleum — she parlayed its success into buying, developing and selling other energy companies. She would not live to see the success of her latest venture, Imaginea Energy Corp., as brain cancer took her life last year.</p>
      <p>Family, friends, colleagues and previous Alberta Business Hall of Fame Southern Alberta inductees saluting this year’s honourees included: 2013 recipient Bob Brawn; 2018 recipient Dr. Chen Fong; 2005 recipient Dick Haskayne; 2016 recipient Ross Glen; JA Southern Alberta president and CEO Melissa From; Hall of Fame board chair and 2015 recipient Keith MacPhail; Calgary Stampede director Lesley Conway; Corus Entertainment board chair Heather Shaw; Haskayne School of Business dean Jim Dewald; proud daughter of the late Suzanne West, Kathy West-Rwamuningi and her husband Costaud Rwamuningi; Anna Cumming, proud wife of honouree Geoff Cumming, and their children James and Diana Shimizu; and others pictured.</p>

Such incredible philanthropy, as well as a stored business career, earned Cumming induction into the Alberta Business Hall of Fame-Southern Alberta.
