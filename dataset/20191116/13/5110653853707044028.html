      <h1>NASCAR starting lineup at Homestead: Denny Hamlin on pole after rain alters schedule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:52:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gatto</a></address>
      <p>The Championship 4 will be the first four on the starting grid Sunday in the final race of the NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series season.</p>
      <p>Rain at Homestead-Miami Speedway caused NASCAR to <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCAR/status/1195502247024746496">cancel Friday's practice session</a> and Saturday's qualifying session for the Ford EcoBoost 400 and assign starting positions based on owner points. The four drivers competing for the Cup Series title this weekend —Denny Hamlin, Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Busch —will start in positions 1-4, respectively.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Hamlin claimed the pole by virtue of his victory in last week's Round of 8 race at Phoenix and his fourth-place finish at Martinsville earlier in the round. Harvick and Truex won the other Round of 8 races but Harvick was fifth at Phoenix and Truex was sixth at Texas. Second-best finish in the round is a tiebreaker, <a href="https://twitter.com/bobpockrass/status/1195508941272371200">per Fox Sports' Bob Pockrass</a>. Busch's best Round of 8 finish was second at Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Cup teams will now practice during the time they were supposed to qualify onSaturday afternoon (2-2:55 p.m. ET).</p>
