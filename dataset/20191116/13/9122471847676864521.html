      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:22:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>A terrifying scene broke out at a high school football game in South Jersey on Friday night, when a gunman sent a round of bullets into the stands.</p>
      <p>Two people were seriously injured when gunshots were made at a high school football playoff game in Pleasantville, New Jersey on Friday night. The game was suspended.</p>
      <p>A gunman allegedly started firing at roughly 8:30 p.m. in the third quarter of a contest between the Camden Panthers and the Pleasantville Greyhounds.</p>
      <p>ABC 6 <a href="https://6abc.com/at-least-2-injured-in-shooting-at-new-jersey-high-school-football-game-/5700604/">had more of the frightening details</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Panicked spectators and some of the players knocked down a fence in their haste to escape the confines of the field.<br/><br/>One of the wounded was a young boy who was apparently sitting in the stands. He was airlifted to a children’s hospital in Philadelphia “with some serious injuries,” Atlantic County Prosecutor Damon Tyner said.<br/><br/>Witnesses say at least half a dozen shots were fired from the bleachers.</blockquote>
      <p>Mike Nik, a journalist for 6ABC News, shared video of the scene:</p>
