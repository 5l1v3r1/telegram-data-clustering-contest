      <h1>What channel is Oklahoma vs. Baylor on today? Time, schedule for Big 12 showdown</h1>

      <p>For the second consecutive week, an under-the-radar undefeated team gets a chance to prove its mettle on a national stage.</p>
      <p>No. 12 Baylor hosts No. 10 Oklahoma for the biggest game on the 8-0 Bears' schedule. Despite the Sooners suffering an upset loss to Kansas State last month, they remain ranked ahead of unbeaten Baylor.</p>

If the Bears can also keep its record perfect, the voters would reward them similarly.</p>
