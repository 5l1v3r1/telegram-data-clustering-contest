      <p><b>YOKOHAMA – </b>Heavy favorite Yuma Kagiyama took the lead after the short program at the Japan Junior Championships at Shin-Yokohama Skate Center on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old from Yokohama racked up a total score of 79.92 points to hold a comfortable advantage over Yuto Kishina (74.29) and rival Shun Sato (74.19) going into Sunday’s free skate.</p>
      <p>Kagiyama, who along with Sato has qualified for next month’s Grand Prix Final in Italy, skated to the Piano Concerto from “Fate” and aside from a bit of a wobble on the landing of his triple axel, was fluid from beginning to end.</p>
      <p>“I turned my shoulder too much on my takeoff on the axel,” Kagiyama stated. “I have to fix that for tomorrow and then land all of my quads.”</p>
      <p>Kagiyama holds the big lead despite getting level threes on two of his spins and step sequence.</p>
      <p>Kishina’s jumps were solid, but he had trouble on one of his spins or would have had a higher score skating as the 28th of 29 skaters.</p>
      <p>Sato, a 15-year-old from Sendai, moved clinically through his jumps to “Arrivee des Camionneurs” to stay within striking distance of Kagiyama.</p>
      <p>“I have three quads planned in my free skate tomorrow and my goal is to land them all,” commented Sato.</p>
      <p>Sato got level fours on two of his spins, but only a level two on his step sequence.</p>
      <p>A berth at the Youth Olympic Games in Lausanne, Switzerland, in January will go to the winner on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Lucas Honda is a surprise in fourth place at 74.14. Sena Miyake (70.53) is fifth, while defending champion Tatsuya Tsuboi (68.83) stands in sixth.</p>
      <p>Mana Kawabe took the lead after the women’s short program earlier Saturday with her perky skate to “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.” Kawabe, who won the West Japan Sectionals two weeks ago, earned a score of 64.95 and looked confident in doing so.</p>
      <p>Kawabe, a 15-year-old from Nagoya, began with a nice triple lutz/triple toe loop combo, then hit a triple loop and a double axel. She received level fours on two of her spins and a level three on her step sequence.</p>
      <p>Tomoe Kawabata (63.55) is in second, while Rino Matsuike (61.91) is third.</p>
      <p>“My speed was good today,” Kawabe stated. “When my jumps go well, my steps and spins usually do also.”</p>
      <p>Kawabata, who was third at this event last year, landed huge jumps in her skate to “On the Beautiful Blue Danube.” She opened with a nice double axel, then hit a booming triple lutz/triple toe loop combo and also landed a triple loop.</p>
      <p>Shiika Yoshioka (60.78) is in fourth place, with Azusa Tanaka (58.58) fifth and Moa Iwano (58.31) sixth.</p>
      <p>The top six finishers in the men’s and women’s competitions will advance to skate in the All-Japan Championships next month in Tokyo.</p>
