      <h1>Golden has golden opportunities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:00:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joanne Elves, for the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>While complaints are on the rise about how congested the national parks are in Alberta and B.C., those in the know know to skip the big parks and head for areas less travelled. The trails are empty, the attractions are uncrowded and restaurants and pubs in the communities always have tables waiting for you. Take for instance, the town of Golden, surrounded by six national parks. With all the changes happening to the community, it’s starting to look like Golden is well, golden.</p>
      <p>Less than three hours from Calgary, Golden (pop 3,700) sits at the confluence of the Kicking Horse River and the Columbia River and the Selkirk, Purcell and Rocky Mountains. The town is a hub for alpine adventures and is moving forward with new accommodations, attractions, renovations and now a burgeoning “booze district.”</p>
      <p>But let’s start with the elephant in the room and that’s the 4.8 kilometres of Highway 1 snaking steeply into town from the east waiting for upgrades. The road work is expected to start next summer and completed in the winter of 2023-24 but until then, travellers may feel some inconvenience. B.C. Transport Minister Claire Trevena says the highway will be shut for weeks at a time during construction, detouring motorists through Radium Hot Springs using highways 93 and 95. The good news is, construction should avoid peak summer and ski season months.</p>
      <p>So, that means Golden is still open for business and here’s what to look forward to.</p>
      <p>
        <b>New booze</b>
      </p>
      <p>Whitetooth Brewery has been hugging the corner leading to the ski resort for three years but in that time it has become a gathering place for every season. On any given day you’ll find skiers, shredders, sledders, bikers, hikers, fishermen and just about anyone looking for a smooth pint to wash back the day before heading off with a growler or two. That’s great in the summer when the patio is open but, the building is feeling the pinch in the winter.</p>
      <p>“We are seeing a lot of people gathering here for a pint or two so it’s time to expand the tasting room,” says co-owner Kent Donaldson. “The plan is to push the tasting room across the entire north wall.”</p>
      <p>Across the street in what was once a hardware store, carpenters are working on a new craft distillery. When finished, Mount 7 Spirits Craft Distillery will also house a gym.</p>
      <p>
        <b>New pillows</b>
      </p>
      <p>Three hotel companies are ready to break ground in Golden. Next spring, Oso plans construction on two buildings between the Kicking Horse River and Whitetooth Brewing. Also in the works for next spring along the Golden Donald Upper Road is a new Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott. Basecamp Resorts has not released construction plans but is also planning a property along the shores of the Kicking Horse River.</p>
      <p>
        <b>New pathway</b>
      </p>
      <p>The longest freestanding timber frame bridge in Canada drapes over the Kicking Horse River right behind the old part of town. It’s a lovely pedestrian bridge linking the paths into both sides of the town. Plans are in the works to enhance the area behind the buildings with patios, new store fronts and a higher, wider path.</p>
      <p>
        <b>New attractions</b>
      </p>
      <p>How’s your short game? Golden Golf Club laid out a mini-golf course this summer to help you with your putting. In the winter, take your cross-country skis and wind through the trees on set tracks.</p>
      <p>If disc golf is more your style, the town offers a course at the Keith King Memorial Park as does Kicking Horse Mountain Resort (KHMR). If you’re at KHMR, clip in for some high-country excitement on the Via Ferrata. The “iron road” is a fixed cable route up and over the rocky crest of Terminator Peak. Don’t forget to say hi to Boo, the resident grizzly while you are there.</p>
      <p>If you are looking for even more high-wire thrills, watch for the adventure park planned for the spring of 2020, criss-crossing over Hospital Creek on the north side of the town. Two suspension bridges, bungee jumps and a bungee swing are in the plans.</p>
      <p>Kicking Horse and the town are both anticipating the start of winter. If the Farmers Almanac is correct, its’ going to be a banner year for snow. Both the resort and town offer excellent choices for accommodation.</p>
