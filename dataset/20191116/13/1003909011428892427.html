      <p>When it comes to skincare and beauty products, many of us think about products made in France or Italy.</p>
      <p>But Calgarians are creating skincare brands that are getting global recognition. Meet the makers of Routine and XO Skincare Lab, two Calgary-based brands making waves around the world.</p>
      <p>Neige Blair has always been interested in holistic, natural skin and body care. When she was 19, she was living in Nelson, B.C., and wildcrafting, harvesting plants for personal and home care products. She couldn’t find a natural deodorant, so she started making her own. Friends loved it and before long, “I was giving it to everyone I knew,” she says.</p>
      <p>But a deodorant company wasn’t sexy, she says with a laugh, and she wanted something that was, so she set about reinventing what would soon become <a href="http://routinecream.com/">Routine</a>.</p>
      <p>“I wanted it to be attainable, but stylish. I didn’t want it to be crunchy,” she says. “Art and music are two of my biggest inspirations, and I wanted to reflect that in what I do every day.”</p>

      <p>She incorporated the brand in 2011 and shortly after that, she paired up with her sister-in-law, Pippa Blair. The team is a true family affair and now includes Neige and Pippa’s brother-in-law and two other sisters-in-law (four in total, including Pippa and Neige), as well as Neige’s best friend; other friends and family pop up as models and contribute when needed.</p>
      <p>This past month, Routine was awarded the ATB and Calgary Chamber of Commerce Small Business of the Year Award. The deodorant jars are now sold at more than 3,000 retailers in countries as far away as the United Arab Emirates and Denmark, and they’ve been written about in American Vogue magazine, GQ, New York magazine, Harper’s Bazaar and others.</p>
      <p>Routine recently expanded its production facilities to a massive warehouse and retail space in northeast Calgary. Following Blair’s passion for music and art, the new digs include a private live music venue and gallery.</p>

      <p>The space opened with a private launch of Reuben and the Dark’s latest album, UnLove, at the end of October. Neige and her team got to know lead singer Reuben Bullock after Neige slipped him a jar of Routine deodorant at a concert, a scent made just for him with one of Neige’s signature quirky names.</p>
      <p>There are now 18 different Routine deodorants and 15 scents. All are made with natural ingredients such as baking soda and essential oils.</p>
      <p>This year, Routine is launching two skin oils. Coming up, watch for body washes, fragrances and, for fans who prefer not to apply their deodorant by hand, deodorant sticks.</p>
      <p>Down the road, “our dream is to have flagship stores so that people can refill their products,” Neige says. “We want less waste and less plastic.”</p>
      <p>They just want to make the world a better place, one beautiful skincare product at a time, she says.</p>
      <p>“Routine has been a vehicle for me to live out my wildest, most magical dreams,” says Neige. “I just want to create joy and make life fun.”</p>

      <p>Annie Graham remembers getting a chemistry set one year when she was a little kid. “I was never a girly girl. I was never into hair and makeup,” she says. “But I liked science.”</p>
      <p>She took the chemistry set and mixed everything together. Then she shook it. “There’s probably still a blue stain on that basement ceiling,” she says with a laugh.</p>
      <p>The experience didn’t turn her off science. In fact, she completed a biology degree and, then, worked in ophthalmology for two decades.  Along the way, she learned a ton about chemicals, our environment and what people want.</p>
      <p>A born and raised Calgarian, she could also see how tough our climate is on people’s skin, so she decided to do something about it.</p>
      <p>In 2014-2015, XO Face Care was born and, then, XO Treatment Room, a shop and clinic on Fourth Street S.W.</p>

      <p>There are now nine XO products, including the bestselling PM face serum, an XO Cherry body lotion, Surface O facial cleanser and more. All are cruelty-free and made with “clever and clean chemistry compounds” suitable for all skin types.</p>
      <p>While Calgary may have been her inspiration, XO products are for sale around the world; Europe, the U.S., and Canada are her biggest markets. And this month, O magazine — as in Oprah Winfrey — features a write-up on XO.</p>
      <p>Graham doesn’t know how Oprah’s magazine staff heard about XO — perhaps it was from one of the company’s myriad celebrity fans, a list that includes Canadian author Amanda Lindhout and models Ashley Callingbull and Kim Noseworthy.</p>
      <p>But global sales are skyrocketing, Graham admits. “It’s the Oprah effect,” she says.</p>
      <p>And it’s proof that she’s on the right path. “We don’t advertise. We don’t pay social media advertisers,” Graham says. “But that’s the nature of a good product — you’re never going to keep it a secret.”</p>
      <p>Graham is still sometimes surprised that she’s doing what she’s doing. “But my brain is full of many more ideas and formulations,” she says.</p>
      <p>“In hindsight, everything I’ve done in my life has set me up for this as a career. Sometimes you just have to go where the wind blows you.”</p>
