      <h2>The Duchess of Sussex is thought to have begun the process shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry was announced in November 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T13:54:48+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>Meghan Markle is still not a British citizen despite applying two years ago.</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Sussex, who is married to the sixth-in-line-to-the-throne, began the process shortly after her engagement to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/prince_harry/index.html">Prince Harry</a> was announced in November 2017, it has been reported.</p>
      <p>Kensington Palace said at the time she would be treated like anyone else.</p>
      <p>Prince Harry's communication's secretary, Jason Knauf, said Ms Markle would be 'compliant with immigration requirements at all times'.</p>
      <p>And it appears she still has not been granted citizenship, despite being a member of the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>A friend of the Duchess told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7692341/Meghan-Markle-waiting-British-citizen.html">MailOnline</a> : "Meghan is not yet a British citizen.</p>

      <p>"It might seem extraordinary, given that she's been married to the Queen's grandson for 18 months, but she accepts that it's a slow process."</p>
      <p>While Meghan still isn’t a British citizen, her son Archie Harrison is.</p>
      <p>Being born in the UK means the couple’s child is automatically a British citizen.</p>
      <p>Meghan and Harry will be able to apply for dual citizenship for their son as Meghan was born and grew up in America.</p>
      <p>As Meghan is still an American citizen, she is therefore required to pay tax in the US for any income earned or allowances she receives.</p>

      <p>It has been speculated that Meghan is applying for citizenship as a spouse of a British citizen.</p>
      <p>If someone comes to the country as the fiancee of a British citizen, they must marry within six months, which the Duchess achieved after marrying Harry in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Before a foreigner comes into the UK as the spouse of a British citizen on a family visa, they must submit a range of evidence to prove their relationship is real.</p>

      <p>After living in the UK for three years, a spouse can then apply for citizenship providing you have either indefinite leave to remain, settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme or a permanent residence document.</p>
      <p>You then have to take a test with questions on life in the UK, which costs £50, to attain citizenship.</p>
      <p>It costs £1,330 to apply to become a British citizen.</p>
      <p>A Kensington Palace spokesperson has been quoted as saying: "The process takes several years."</p>
