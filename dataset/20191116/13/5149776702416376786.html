      <p>The Victoria Centre bus station will close to passengers this afternoon as work continues to fix electrical problems at the site.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-council">Nottingham City Council</a> announced this morning (November 16) that the station's travel centre had closed because of a power outage.</p>
      <p>Now, the authority has confirmed the bus station will close at 2pm "<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/six-flood-warnings-still-remain-3545479">following earlier electrical issues</a> ".</p>
      <p>In a statement, a spokesman added: "The power company is still on site, but it's not safe to remain open with no lighting."</p>
      <p>Commuters are being advised to contact their bus operators directly for alternative pick-up and drop-off points.</p>
