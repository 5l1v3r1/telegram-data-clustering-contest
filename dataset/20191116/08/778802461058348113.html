        <b>Des vents violents menaçaient de s’abattre samedi sur la ville italienne de Venise, deux jours après que les autorités ont décrété l’état d’urgence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Le niveau d’alerte météorologique a légèrement baissé samedi à Venise. La ville est toutefois toujours inondée et placée sous état d’urgence au lendemain d’un nouveau pic de marée haute qui a dévasté la fragile cité lacustre.</p>
      <p>La protection civile italienne a rétrogradé le niveau d’alerte de «rouge» à «orange» samedi, même si le risque de marée et de vents violents n’était pas écarté. Vendredi, l’«acqua alta», ou marée haute a atteint 1,54 mètre et conduit à la fermeture pendant plusieurs heures de l’emblématique place Saint-Marc.</p>

      <p>Mardi soir, Venise avait connu sa pire marée haute en 53 ans (1,87 m, soit le deuxième record historique derrière celui du 4 novembre 1966 (1,94 m). L’eau a envahi les églises, commerces, musées et hôtels de ce joyau classé au patrimoine mondial.</p>
      <p>Comme beaucoup d’institutions culturelles, le musée Guggenheim avait prévu de rouvrir vendredi mais a changé d’avis «en raison de conditions météo qui empirent». La plupart des distributeurs de billets étaient hors d’usage samedi dans la ville.</p>
      <h3>Premières annulations</h3>
      <p>Le ministre italien de la Culture, Dario Franceschini, venu vendredi constater sur place les dégâts, estime que les travaux de réparation seront considérables. Plus de 50 églises ont été endommagées, a-t-il noté. «Toutes les réserves qui sont en sous-sol sont perdues !», se lamentait Luciano, un habitant de Venise et employé d’un magasin place Saint-Marc. Venise reçoit 36 millions de touristes par an dont 90% d’étrangers. Des hôtels, dont la Locanda Al Leon, commencent à déplorer des annulations pour les fêtes de fin d’année.</p>

      <p>Le maire de Venise a annoncé vendredi l’ouverture d’un compte bancaire pour tous ceux qui, en Italie et à l’étranger, souhaitent contribuer aux réparations. «Venise, endroit unique, est l’héritage de tout le monde. Grâce à votre aide, Venise brillera de nouveau», a-t-il écrit dans un communiqué.</p>
      <p>Jeudi soir, le gouvernement du premier ministre Giuseppe Conte avait approuvé l’instauration de l’état d’urgence à Venise et annoncé le déblocage de 20 millions d’euros «pour les interventions les plus urgentes». Cette procédure d’état d’urgence, souvent utilisée dans une Italie régulièrement frappée par des désastres (séismes, éruptions volcaniques et glissements de terrain), dote le gouvernement de «pouvoirs et moyens exceptionnels».</p>
      <p>«Tropicalisation» de la météo</p>
      <p>La Sérénissime, bâtie sur 118 îles et îlots en majorité artificiels et sur pilotis, est menacée d’engloutissement. Elle s’est enfoncée de 30 centimètres dans la mer Adriatique en un siècle. Pour le ministre de l’Environnement Sergio Costa, la fragilité de Venise s’est accrue en raison de la «tropicalisation» de la météo, avec d’intenses précipitations et de fortes rafales de vent, liée au réchauffement climatique.</p>
      <p>Les écologistes montrent aussi du doigt l’expansion du grand port industriel de Marghera, situé en face de Venise, et le défilé des bateaux de croisière géants. L’«acqua alta» record de mardi a submergé 80% de la cité, provoqué la mort d’un septuagénaire et renversé des gondoles ainsi que des vaporetti, (bateaux de transport public).</p>
      <p>De nombreux responsables, dont le maire de Venise, ont appelé à mettre en service «au plus vite» le projet de digues MOSE (Moïse en italien, acronyme de Module expérimental électromécanique).</p>
      <p>Lancé en 2003 et retardé par des malfaçons et des enquêtes pour corruption, Moïse s’appuie sur 78 digues flottantes qui se relèvent et barrent l’accès à la lagune en cas de montée des eaux de l’Adriatique jusqu’à trois mètres de hauteur. De récents tests ont permis d’identifier des vibrations et de la rouille mais, selon M. Conte, il est «prêt à 93%» et sera «achevé au printemps 2021».</p>
