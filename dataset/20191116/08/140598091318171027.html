      <h3>What do we know about Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Circuit length: </b>4.309km</li>
        <li><b>First grand prix: </b>1973</li>
        <li><b>Laps: </b>71</li>
        <li><b>Race distance:</b> 305.909km</li>
        <li><b>Race lap record:</b> 1.10.540 - Valtteri Bottas, 2018</li>
        <li><b>2018 winner: </b>Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes</li>
        <li><b>Number of corners:</b> 15</li>
        <li><b>Overtaking chances: </b>There is not an abundance of places for an overtake but plenty of action happens at the start of the lap, with DRS on the pit straight, making the braking zone into turns one and two the best and most common place to move up a spot. There's an outside chance on the back straight, if you can get a really good run but it's risky. Elsewhere it's just a bit too tight without a mistake from the driver ahead. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What are the odds (top six)?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Lewis Hamilton</b> 11/8</li>
        <li><b>Max Verstappen</b> 11/4</li>
        <li><b>Valtteri Bottas</b> 11/4</li>
        <li><b>Sebastian Vettel </b>5/1</li>
        <li><b>Charles Leclerc </b>14/1</li>
        <li><b>Alexander Albon</b> 100/1</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What is our prediction?</h3>
      <p>The United States Grand Prix was a bit of a shock for Ferrari. They were less competitive in qualifying, though hardly a million miles away, but their race pace was atrocious. Mercedes again emerged as the fastest team on Sunday and you would expect them to be the quickest at Interlagos, too. The circuit is both quite twisty and fairly quick and without any particularly long straights. That said, the drag through the final few corners is flat out and that could favour Ferrari. Or at least offset any difficulties they might have. </p>
      <p>Still, it's difficult to look past Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton normally goes quite well in Brazil. Red Bull could be back in contention this week again, so I expect Verstappen to be Mercedes' main challenger, given the step backwards Ferrari had in Austin. </p>
      <p><b>Podium prediction:</b> 1st Hamilton 2nd Bottas 3rd Verstappen</p>
