      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:32+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/363368-delayed-deployment-of-materials-to-pus-in-lokoja.html" target="_blank">Josiah Oluwole</a></address>
      <p>There is a widespread delayed deployment of electoral materials from the various RACs to PU in Lokoja LGA.</p>
      <p>The issue has been blamed on the reporting of security officials to the RACs behind schedule.</p>
      <p>At the Crowther Memorial College, in Lokoja, policemen were only deployed to the centre well after Rapp a.m.</p>
      <p>Also at Kabawa Open Space RAC some policemen reported late to the centre, hampering deployment.</p>
      <p>An INEC official confirmed to PREMIUM TIMES that the deployment of security personnel was coming late because some of them came behind schedule.</p>
      <p>He said he was making efforts to ensure the policemen got to their locations as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>As at 8 a.m. there were signs that the polling unit 003 at Kabawa would not start as scheduled.</p>
      <p>An official said the materials were not complete.</p>
      <p>He specifically mentioned that the liquid gums provided were insufficient and efforts were being made to provide more.</p>
