      <p>By starting their own newspapers, political parties and business groups are promoting their vested interests and compromising the values of journalism, Vice President M <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/venkaiah-naidu">Venkaiah Naidu </a>said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Naidu was speaking at an event organised by the Press Council of India to observe the National Press Day and confer National Awards for Excellence in Journalism.</p>
      <p>"Nowadays business groups and political parties are also starting their own newspapers and channels. Through these, they are promoting their vested interests and compromising the values of journalism," he said.</p>
      <p>Naidu stressed that if a newspaper is run by a political party, it should clearly mention so.</p>
      <p>He also urged journalists to exercise caution in the time of sensationalism.</p>
      <p>"Sensationalism has become order of the day, sensational <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/economy-policy-news-1020101.htm">news </a>means senseless news," he said.</p>
      <p>Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar said in today's time fake <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/economy-policy-news-1020101.htm">news </a>is a bigger crisis than paid <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/economy-policy-news-1020101.htm">news.</a></p>
      <p>"This is the day for the press to understand its freedom as well as its responsibility. Today there is a crisis of fake news more than paid news," he stressed.</p>
