      <p><a href="https://www.kpopmap.com/kpop-member-profile/gi-dle/"><b>(G)I-DLE</b> member <b>YuQi</b> </a>is currently being criticized for a statement she made about skin color.</p>
      <p>Fellow group member <b>ShuHua</b> was talking about the K-Drama “Signal”, and it was then when YuQi joked saying if she wanted to be a police officer, she would need darker skin to hide in the dark while waiting to catch criminals.</p>
      <p>Naturally this has angered international fans.</p>
