        <b>Bhumi Pednekar is upfront, frank and has no inhibitions when it comes to fashion. In our latest episode of Fashion Vashion And All That, the Bala actress bares it all</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bhumi Pednekar is our latest guest on Fashion Vashion And All That. The Bala actress, dressed in shocking pink pantsuit and neon orange inner with matching heels, looked quite sexy as she sat down for a chat with us. </p>
      <p>We started our conversation with Bhumi asking her how difficult was it to break from the mould of always playing deglam roles to channelise the inner style diva. Bhumi in her most candid way said that she has always felt sexy about herself. Even when she was 90 kg, the actress wore shorts clothes, had no qualms in flaunting her cleavage. </p>

      <p>We also spoke about actresses being pitted against each other on the basis of what they're wearing. Bhumi has an easy policy there too. "If something I wore looked better on someone else, then why not?" said Bhumi, cheekily.</p>
      <p>Bhumi, who just delivered a hit at the box-office with Bala, seemed confident, eased out and relaxed in her skin. Click above and watch the video for an extremely candid chat with the actress. <br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- spotboye team</i></p>
