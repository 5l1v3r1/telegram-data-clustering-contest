      <p>Tidal Reach is a stand out home which enjoys breathtaking views of the Bristol Channel.</p>
      <p>As well as a Mediterranean courtyard it also boasts two balconies to which to sit on and soak up the sun - when it appears -  a roof deck and even its own swimming pool.</p>
      <p>The property, at Edgehill Road, is arranged over three floors and was justifiably a finalist in the regional LABC 204 Building Excellence Awards.</p>

      <p>The house centres itself on the view which is showcased from each principle room - with the main living accommodation arranged over the first and second floors to take full advantage of the property's position.</p>
      <p>Both the upper floors have been finished with tri-folding doors to access the full width balconies, and from the first floor the balcony stretches onto the fabulous artificial turf roof deck – tracking the day's sun from sunrise to sunset with uninterrupted sea views.</p>
      <p>Internally, little expense has been spared, from the acres of carefully laid marble flooring with underfloor heating.</p>

      <p>The house also has a state of the art ARTEOR Lifestyle system – controlling everything from the gated drive, heating and lighting to the sound system, curtains and swimming pool.</p>
      <p>The kitchen is bespoke and installed by Mayflower of Somerset and finished with Silestone Quartz worktops and a generous central island and breakfast bar.</p>
      <p>From the sitting room, sliding doors open to the luxury indoor swimming pool with multi-coloured LED ceiling lights and mirrored walls, complete with an air source heating system and motorised jet counter-current swim system.</p>

      <p>The pool itself opens into a gym, and this enjoys a fully fitted wet-room and cloakroom with doors from the gym opening to the raised courtyard garden.</p>
      <p>Above, the accommodation is arranged as a full-floor master suite – complete with a spacious family room with folding doors out to a full width balcony and an exceptional master bedroom suite.</p>
      <p>Views of the channel can be enjoyed from the bed in the master suite which also has an en suite shower room with oversize walk in shower, twin ended bath and his and hers sinks.</p>

      <p>Over the ground floor are three family / guest bedrooms – each with either an en-suite bath or shower room along with a separate fitted study.</p>
      <p>Two of the bedrooms open out to a private courtyard garden, catching much of the day's sun.</p>
      <p>Outside, like the house itself, the outside space of Tidal Reach focuses on the sun and the views, with two tiers of full-width balconies facing southwest and offering far reaching coastal views right up until sunset.</p>

      <p>The first-floor balcony seamlessly opens into the house, really bringing the outside in, and leads to the generous roof deck – a perfect space to unwind, dine and entertain whilst taking in the views.</p>
      <p>There is access from the gated driveway to the first-floor balcony via stone steps, and then upwards to the first-floor courtyard garden.</p>

      <p>Above this lies a beautiful Mediterranean style courtyard garden, perfect for BBQ's, al-fresco dining and catching the last of the day's sun.</p>
      <p>There is ample room on the gated drive to park several cars, with a further double garage accessed via electric up and over doors.</p>
      <p>From the rear the property backs on to the town’s golf course and has uninterrupted views across Layde Bay to the Bristol Channel taking in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/clevedon">Clevedon</a> Pier, Flat Holm island and, on a clear day, views as far west as Ilfracombe.</p>
