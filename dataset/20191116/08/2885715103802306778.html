      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sonam-kapoor/">Sonam Kapoor</a> Ahuja can effortlessly rock any look — be it an elaborate sari with jacket, a ruffled dress or even casual street style wear. But there is one staple she keeps going back to — blazers. Recently, for an event in Mumbai, the <i>Neerja</i> actor opted for an Roland Mouret ensemble that combined a pair of relaxed beige trousers with a floral satin blouse and a matching blazer.</p>
      <p>For the outing, Kapoor ditched a bespoke suit (which she has been spotted in the past) and opted for a relaxed look. She rounded out her look with black Armani heels and a Rheson top handle bag that matched the colour of her trousers.</p>

      <p>For makeup, she opted for a nude look that comprised brown lips, bronzed cheeks, and a classic black eyeliner — which complemented the look beautifully.</p>
      <p>This is not the first the <i>Veere Di Wedding</i> actor has aced the floral trend. Earlier, she was spotted in a floral ensemble from Escada that was teamed with a matching blazer. The look was accessorised with a belt and silver hoop earrings. A dash of pink lipstick rounded out the look, and the actor cut a rather pretty picture.</p>
