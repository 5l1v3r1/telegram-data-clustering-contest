      <p>A Qantas plane made an emergency landing at a New Zealand military base on Saturday, with passengers stuck in a sweltering cabin for four hours while emergency work was carried out on the plane.</p>
      <p>Passengers aboard the Boeing 737, on flight QF171 from Melbourne to Wellington, were stuck on the tarmac at the Ohakea military base, about 150 kilometres north of Wellington.</p>

      <p>A woman whose partner was aboard the plane said passengers were told there was a problem with the plane, and it needed to divert to the base because it had better emergency services.</p>
      <p>"Then they had to get really low, because apparently the wing flaps were gone. They couldn't get them to work," she said.</p>
      <p>"When they pulled up, there were lots of fire trucks. Then they made them sit on the plane for four hours.</p>
      <p>"They turned the airconditioning off. Everyone was sweltering on the plane. They wouldn't let them get off because it was a military base."</p>

      <p>A Qantas spokesman said the diversion was due to a mechanical issue, and apologised to passengers.</p>
      <p>"The aircraft diverted to Ohakea due to a mechanical issue where it landed safely," he said.</p>
      <p>"We apologise to our customers for the disruption, but safety will always be our first priority.</p>
      <p>"Usually in these circumstances the aircraft would divert to Palmerston, however this was not possible due to local weather conditions."</p>
      <p>Passengers were taken by bus to Wellington to complete their journey, he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, passengers tweeted about being stuck on the military base tarmac.</p>
      <p>"Awkward when your international flight gets diverted to an air base, and they can’t let you off the plane because there’s no customs," Suzy McKinney tweeted.</p>
      <p>#QF171 Can’t leave plane because no customs, can’t fly plane as broken, can’t get replacement plane (easily at least) as at air base. A difficult problem to solve."</p>
