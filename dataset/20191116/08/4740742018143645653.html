      <h1>How a flea market under the M32 is helping transform a 'deprived' area of Bristol</h1>
      <h2>Organisers say the area under the M32 was considered 'dangerous' by residents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Organisers of a flea market underneath the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/m32-motorway">M32</a> say it is helping uplift a derelict space once blighted by prostitution and drug pushing.</p>
      <p>The M32 Flea Market has been running for two years in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/eastville">Eastville</a> and in that time has grown to feature a variety of local crafters and artists.</p>
      <p>The market was launched by LitterARTI, an organisation which attempts to bring communities together through events and other projects.</p>
      <p>One of its founders, Annali Grimes, said she wanted to help transform the underpass which was considered "dangerous" by residents living nearby.</p>
      <p>“When we started working in Eastville underneath the motorway, the only thing positive here was the DIY skatepark," she said.</p>

      <p>"What struck me was that people lived around this area, their homes were here, the main feature is the M32 Motorway and they had this dead space right on their doorsteps, where prostitution, drug pushing and fly-tipping was happening.</p>
      <p>"It was dark and dangerous. It's a prominent space and a lot of people would try to avoid it.</p>
      <p>"We asked the question: What if the local community could actually benefit from this space, become guardians and look after it?</p>
      <p>Taking inspiration from the DIY Skatepark under the same bridge, Annali began to raise funds and sought advice from residents.</p>
      <p>"We had an initial consultation with local people and the idea of the market came from that," she said.</p>

      <p>"It follows in the legacy of the old market which was held in the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ikea-bristol">Ikea</a> car park years ago."</p>
      <p>Annali added the market has transformed the underpass and "reconnected" communities since it launched two years ago.</p>
      <p>"By bringing events and people into the space, the M32 underpass is transformed into a vibrant and friendly space with the community coming together," she said.</p>
      <p>"The M32 has cut off the communities in the area, such as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/fishponds">Fishponds</a> and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/easton">Easton</a>.</p>
      <p>"These communities were once connected in the past and through the market we are reconnecting them.</p>
      <p>"When the M32 Flea Market is on, you forget the problems in the area and for those few hours the space is filled with a bustling, happening, creative energy.</p>
      <p>"There's friendly and colourful characters everywhere, with cool and curious stalls, ranging from pre-loved clothing to vintage and hand-made.”</p>
