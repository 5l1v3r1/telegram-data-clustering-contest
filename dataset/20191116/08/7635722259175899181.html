      </p>
      <p>A cold start, with frost, icy patches and also some mist.</p>
      <p>These clearing with some hazy sunshine for a time, but soon turning fairly cloudy.</p>
      <p>A few showers on northern coasts, but dry elsewhere.</p>
      <p>By early afternoon, rain will affect Atlantic coastal counties, with just an odd light shower elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Top temperatures 5 to 8C.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tonight</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cold tonight.</p>
      <p>Rather cloudy and misty generally, with some showery rain at times, this mainly in the western half of the country.</p>
      <p>But some clear spells also, with a local frost, this most likely in eastern areas.</p>
      <p>Lowest temperatures -1 to +3C, but temperatures should rise a little before dawn.</p>
