      <h1>Bristol City season player ratings: Williams and Bentley heroes, Semenyo struggles</h1>
      <h2>See which players have impressed and which have struggled for form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>Despite a difficult first two games, City have only lost twice in the Championship this season and find themselves in sixth place ahead of the international break.</p>
      <p>There's still a long way to go but several City players have already outdone themselves, while others have struggled to make an impact on the pitch.</p>
      <p>There have been some stellar performances from Robins' players this season, with stand outs being Ashley Williams' defensive masterclass vs Cardiff and Josh Brownhill's inspired performance in the comeback vs Charlton.</p>
      <p>We've taken a look at all the player ratings given to City players by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/">Bristol Live</a> Robins reporter Gregor MacGregor, and taken the average for the Championship season so far.</p>
      <p>The players below have all played five or more games for City this season and are ranked from highest to lowest.</p>
      <h3>David Bentley</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating</b>: 7.3</p>
      <p><b>Best performance</b>: 1-0 vs Reading (H)</p>
      <p>According to the average player ratings, Bentley has been City's stand out performer this season.</p>
      <p>He has been rated a six on just three occasions since his move from Brentford, with his goalkeeping <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/bristol-city-reading-player-ratings-3396964">heroics in the win against Reading</a> earning him a nine.</p>
      <p>He has played every single Championship game this season, one of only three City players to do so, and has so far kept four clean sheets.</p>
      <h3>Ashley Williams</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>7.1</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>1-0 vs Cardiff (A)</p>
      <p>Since his move to BS3 it's difficult to pick out a poor defensive display from the Wales defender.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Williams has brought a wealth of experience to the back four and has most likely helped the likes of Taylor Moore also impress this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/as-good-goal-bristol-city-3521672">His dominating performance against Cardiff</a> is one to remember.</p>
      <h3>Tomas Kalas</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>7.0</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>3-1 vs Hull (A)</p>
      <p>The big Czech was enjoying his best performance of the season in August against the Tigers until his hamstring injury saw him leave the field.</p>
      <p>Fans were delirious when he signed permanently from Chelsea after an impressive loan spell last season. It's clear to see why he has slotted right back into the defence upon his injury return.</p>
      <h3>Tommy Rowe</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.9</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>1-0 vs Cardiff (A)</p>
      <p>Mr Consistent.</p>
      <p>Tommy Rowe has been a valuable asset for City this season, starting well in central midfield before excellently covering at left-back for the injured Jay Dasilva.</p>
      <p>He has never scored below a six and set up Brownhill's goal <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/as-good-goal-bristol-city-3521672">against Cardiff</a> in what was rated as his best performance of the season so far.</p>
      <h3>Callum O'Dowda</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.9</p>
      <p><b>Best performance</b>: 2-2 vs Middlesbrough (H)</p>
      <p>O'Dowda came on to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/tough-spell-him-bristol-city-3270479">rescue the point against Boro</a> in August when he set up Tommy Rowe for the equaliser.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland international needs to add more goals to his game, but is a creative spark in the City midfield.</p>
      <p>He also fared well in a more central role against Cardiff.</p>

      <h3>Kasey Palmer</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.9</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>2-2 vs Middlesbrough (H)</p>
      <p>Another Chelsea loan signing made permanent, Palmer has continued to impress this season.</p>
      <p>He took his goal well against Boro and has chipped in with another three assists so far from midfield.</p>
      <p>One of the most consistent performers for Lee Johnson's side.</p>
      <h3>Niclas Eliasson</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.8</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>2-2 vs Middlesbrough (H)</p>
      <p>Some fans are baffled at how Eliasson doesn't get more starts in the league.</p>
      <p>The Swede sits second on the Championship assist charts, only behind West Brom's star man Matheus Pereira and was unstoppable against Boro at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Needs to improve his finishing as he hasn't yet scored this season and his passing accuracy (<a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Players/128655/Show/Niclas-Eliasson">63 per cent</a>), but deserves more starts.</p>
      <h3>Nathan Baker</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.7</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>3-3 vs Preston North End (A)</p>
      <p>Baker is a colossus in the air and doesn't often get beaten.</p>
      <p>This was shown during his dominant display<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/another-imperious-defensive-display-bristol-3371802"> against Preston in September</a>. Despite shipping three goals, Baker won the most aerial duels, had the most clearances and scored his only goal of the season so far.</p>
      <p>However he didn't play well against Barnsley in November, being rated a five after City let a two-goal lead slip.</p>
      <h3>Josh Brownhill</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.7</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>1-0 vs Cardiff (A)</p>
      <p>It seems quite a harsh rating for the captain, but that's largely down to the fact that he has played every game this season and scored a lot of consistent sixes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3523323.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JMP_Cardiff_City_v_Bristol_City_RS_087JPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Josh Brownhill celebrates beating Cardiff City</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>His goal against Cardiff will be remembered by Robins fans for years to come and his performance in the 2-1 win over Charlton, where Brownhill scored a 98th minute winning penalty, was also one of his best this season.</p>
      <h3>Famara Diedhiou</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.7</p>
      <p><b>Best performance</b>: 1-0 vs Reading (H)</p>
      <p>The big man up top sealed a good <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/bristol-city-reading-player-ratings-3396964">win against Reading</a> earlier in the season and has chipped in with four goals, but fans are still concerned about his consistency in front of goal.</p>
      <p>He is about to come back from suspension and will need to be firing on all cylinders if City are to continue their promotion push.</p>
      <h3>Jack Hunt </h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.7 </p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>2-1 vs Stoke (A)</p>
      <p>'Hunty' has bagged himself three assists so far this season and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/changed-game-bristol-city-player-3319926">two of those were in the game against Stoke</a>.</p>
      <p>Johnson sung his praises after that performance and the attacking full back has continued to endear himself to fans since his move from Sheffield Wednesday last season. </p>
      <p>Like most of the defence, he didn't play well in the opener against Leeds but has impressed since.</p>
      <h3>Han-Noah Massengo</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.6</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>3-3 vs Preston North End (A)</p>
      <p>Another player with consistent sixes across the board.</p>
      <p>The young midfielder is a huge fan favourite at Ashton Gate and has impressed with his mature performances.</p>
      <p>He did well in the Preston draw in September with some outrageous skill and his ability to draw fouls and press the ball.</p>
      <h3>Andi Weimann</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.6</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>1-1 vs Brentford (A)</p>
      <p>The Austrian is City's top scorer this season and started the campaign with a bang as arguably the Robins No1 performer.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3471864.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Bristol-City-v-Wigan-Athletic-271019.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Andi Weimann of Bristol City celebrates scoring a goal<cite>(Image: Dougie Allward/JMP)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/saved-day-how-bristol-city-3387022">His 87th minute goal against Brentford</a> in October salvaged a hard-fought draw and he has chipped in with goals at important times.</p>
      <p>However, poor performances at Charlton and Luton dropped his average rating.</p>
      <h3>Pedro Pereira </h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.6</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>1-0 vs Cardiff (A) </p>
      <p>The young Portuguese right-back has acquitted himself well in the absence of Jack Hunt in recent weeks. </p>
      <p>He had a bit of slow start to the season but brings the ball forward well and wants to attack.</p>
      <p>As with many City players, the performance against Cardiff was one of his best all season.</p>
      <h3>Taylor Moore</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>6.5</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>1-0 vs Reading (H)</p>
      <p>Taylor Moore has established himself in the first team at Ashton Gate this season and has been a consistent performer across that back line.</p>
      <p>The young defender is good on the ball and intercepted well during the Reading win in October.</p>
      <p>A below-par performance against Middlesbrough dropped his average score, but Moore has been a good partner to the likes of Williams, Baker and Kalas.</p>
      <h3>Antoine Semenyo</h3>
      <p><b>Average rating: </b>5.6</p>
      <p><b>Best performance: </b>2-1 vs Stoke (A)</p>
      <p>The youngster has struggled this season in his five appearances.</p>
      <p>He made plenty of tackles and and the held the ball up well in the win <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/changed-game-bristol-city-player-3319926">against Stoke</a> in September, but does not look comfortable in front of goal.</p>

        <figcaption>Antoine Semenyo slides in to try and keep the ball in play</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Poor performances against Barnsley and Charlton let him down, but he still has plenty of time to turn his season around.</p>
      <h3>Cameo appearances</h3>
      <p>The rest of the City squad have either struggled for game time or have been out with long term injuries since the start of the seaosn.</p>
      <p>Here's how they have fared despite their lack of minutes ...</p>
      <p><b>Adam Nagy </b>(three games): 7.7</p>
      <p><b>Benik Afobe </b>(four games) 6.8</p>
      <p><b>Marley Watkins </b>(three games): 6.3</p>
      <p><b>Rodri </b>(three games): 6.3</p>
      <p><b>Sammie Szmodics </b>(two games): 6.0</p>
