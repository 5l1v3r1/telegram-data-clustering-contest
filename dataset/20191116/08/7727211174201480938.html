      <p>A mum-of-two had a seizure, broke her back in four places and was diagnosed with a bone condition all in one day.</p>
      <p>Tracy Smith, from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">St Helens</a>, was at work as a carer in the community when she had an epileptic seizure two weeks ago - which she had never had before.</p>
      <p>When she came round, the 42-year-old said her tongue was hurting and she was surrounded by paramedics.</p>
      <p>Tracy said the pain in her back was "horrendous" and she was taken to hospital for her injuries.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO</a> : "I was at work as a carer in the community and I was giving a patient a body wash when a light just went out.</p>

      <p>"I blacked out and my work colleague was next to me and I remember my tongue was hurting - I had bit through my tongue.</p>
      <p>"I was panicking the pain was horrendous.</p>
      <p>"Everything was calm before I got to the hospitalÂ  and then doctors started running to see the X-ray and I think the severity of my injuries hit them.</p>
      <p>"I woke up that Wednesday, fine, I went to work had an epileptic seizure, broke my back in four places and diagnosed with osteoporosis all in one day.</p>
      <p>"I just want to get my life I used to have back, it has changed so much I want to be back at work and my life back to how it was."</p>

      <p>The mum had broken her spine in four places, which included a burst fracture - meaning parts of the spine shatters into surrounding tissue ad sometimes the spinal canal.</p>
      <p>Tracy was transferred to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/the-walton-centre-1">Walton Centre</a> where she had an eight hour operation to rebuild the bottom of her back with "bolts and screws."</p>
      <p>She claims doctors prepared her for the worst and told her she might never walk again.</p>
      <p>After an eight hour operation Tracy's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/nhs">surgery</a> was successful, however the mum said she has a long recovery ahead.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old was also diagnosed with osteoporosis - a condition that weakens the bones and makes them more likely to break, making Tracy's recovery even more difficult.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">St Helens mum</a> said she currently relies on using a wheelchair or a shopping trolley to get around the house and her 18-year-old daughter has to do all of her personal care.</p>
      <p>She added: "I'm still in shock, I cry sometimes. I used to have such a normal life and now I am in a wheelchair or I have to use one of those trolleys that elderly people use to get around the house.</p>
      <p>"My daughter has been amazing, she's only 18 and she was there from 8am to 11pm when I was in hospital.</p>
      <p>"She now does all of my personal care including washing and showering and I have my mum looking after me.</p>
      <p>"I just want the life I used to have. If I have to use a walking stick in the future I would like a pink one.</p>
      <p>"I am dead girlie, I always get my nails done and I work hard for that - I just want to be to be who I was before."</p>
      <p>Tracy said <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/nhs">doctors</a> are now waiting to see how her body recovers and will see a specialist in a few weeks time.</p>
      <p>The mum was provided some aids from the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> to help with her recovery at home and is on a waiting list for physiotherapy.</p>
      <p>However, her friends and family have set up a <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/tracys-troopers?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Yimbyprojectpage&amp;utm_content=tracys-troopers&amp;utm_campaign=projectpage-share-owner&amp;utm_term=Y5XMVbdQK&amp;fbclid=IwAR3Pxhp3E1Hbhp-bEtudvgmMBQPefcduLz9dp5e5m3zcfuuZmK_UWX18Ud8">JustGiving</a> page to get extra equipment to aid a quicker recovery and help the mum 'get back on her feet' and the 'chance to get her future back.'</p>
      <p>Her family and friends hope enough donations will be raised to access physiotherapy earlier through private healthcare providers so the mum has the best chance to get back to work and normality.</p>
      <p>Tracy added: "I love working, it's the best job I have ever had and I have always worked, I don't want to be just sitting at home."</p>
