      <h1>Should Everton consider move to hijack Manchester United’s Mario Mandzukic approach?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:45:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are reportedly closing in on the signing of Juventus target man Mario Mandzukic ahead of the January transfer window, but there is plenty of time for an evelenth-hour move – and Everton have got to consider the Croat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/paratici-a-londra-incontra-lo-united-si-tratta-per-mandzukic-il--38525">Italian outlet CalcioMercato have claimed</a> that both Tottenham and West Ham are monitoring Manchester United’s pursuit of the 33-year-old – who has fallen out of favour at Juventus under Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the 89-time Croatia international has failed to make a single appearance for Juventus this season. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala are all above the former Bayern Munich attacker in the pecking order.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/mandzukic-on-man-utds-january-transfer-window-shortlist/1pl36kwu6uhzz1pd905r4x9tp5">Goal claim</a> that Mandzukic is available in the January window for a bargain £9million fee. Following that report, CalcioMercato claimed that Spurs and West Ham eye the Croatian ace – but that he is ready to say yes to Manchester United.</p>

      <p>However, Everton need to join Spurs and West Ham in monitoring the veteran as they continue to lack a centre-forward that can finally replace the loss of Romelu Lukaku – ironically what Manchester United are looking to do with Mandzukic.</p>
      <p>Moise Kean joined Everton in the summer – also from Juventus – but the Italy international has struggled at Goodison Park and has so far failed to score for Marco Silva’s side. Dom Calvert-Lewin and even Cenk Tosun is being preferred.</p>
      <p>But for such a small figure and given his enormous experience and calibre, surely Everton have got to sign Mandzukic and solve their striker crisis for at least two or three seasons.</p>
