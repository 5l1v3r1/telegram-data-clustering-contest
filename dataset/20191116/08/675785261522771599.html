      <h2>Chelsea have reportedly spoken to Jody Morris about his social media behaviour after he mocked former manager Jose Mourinho</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:19:40+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea have reportedly warned assistant manager Jody Morris over his use of social media.</p>
      <p>It comes after he hit the headlines for posting a video on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> story last week mocking former manager Jose Mourinho in response to comments made by the Portuguese boss about the Blues.</p>
      <p>Mourinho stated he was worried about Chelsea's defence despite their fine form in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Morris quoted a tweet of the video, adding: "Jose is still worried" followed by a string of laughing emojis before posting a video pretending to cry on Instagram accompanied by Bitter Sweet Symphony by The Verve.</p>
      <p>The former player, now a key member of Frank Lampard's backroom staff, is active on social media and, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7690741/Chelsea-warn-Jody-Morris-social-media-use-mocked-bitter-Jose-Mourinho.html">Daily Mail</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> believe some of his activity is inappropriate for a senior member of coaching staff.</p>

      <p>He has been asked to show more restraint moving forwards, although they have no plans to ban him from social media.</p>
      <p>Morris, who played over 100 games for Chelsea between 1996 and 2003, returned to Stamford Bridge to begin his coaching career in the youth system after retiring in 2013.</p>
      <p>He worked his way into the role of Under 18s head coach in 2016/17 and led the club to their fifth straight FA Youth Cup win in 2018.</p>

      <p>He departed for Derby, working as assistant manager under Frank Lampard last season, before the pair returned to Chelsea this season.</p>
      <p>They have enjoyed a strong start to life in charge at Stamford Bridge, with their youthful side sitting third in the table after a run of six straight Premier League wins.</p>
