      <p>While on international duty, Cristiano Ronaldo was seen jokingly grabbing a fan's phone while the supporter was filming the Juventus star from his vehicle. Did you see it?</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was at his best for Portugal on Thursday evening, inspiring his national team to a 6-0 win over Lithuania in a 2020 European Championship qualifier.</p>
      <p>"CR7" scored a hat-trick on the night, and in the process, amassed his 98th goal for A Selecao.</p>

      <p>In fact, a fan was so inspired by his performance that he invaded the pitch and managed to get a once-in-a-lifetime selfie with the ex-Real Madrid goal machine.</p>
      <p>That being said, Ronaldo recently trolled another supporter while taking a walk, pretending to steal the fan's phone while being recorded from a vehicle.</p>
