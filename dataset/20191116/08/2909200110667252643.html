        <b>The Report of the committee set up by the University of Ghana (UG) to investigate allegations of sexual harassment made by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) against two lecturers of the University of Ghana has exonerated Prof Yaw Van Gyampo, MyNewsGh.com can authoritatively confirm.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report was submitted to the management of the school about a week ago to the Vice-Chancellor Prof Ebenezer Oduro Owusu however discovered that beyond Gyampo’s engagement with the BBC undercover team, complaints have been lodged against him (Gyampo) and several top faculty members of the University of Ghana who are alleged to prey on students through academic blackmail, extortion of sex and intimidation.</p>
      <p>MyNewsGh.com broke news of Professor Ransford Gyampo and Dr Paul Kwame Butakor’s interdiction after they were caught in the ‘sex-for-grades’ undercover documentary. The University therefore formed a committee to investigate the allegations of harassment made against the two lecturers by the BBC.</p>
      <p>A source inside University of Ghana confirming the details of the report to MyNewsGH said for Prof Gyampo, although the report on the current matter (BBC Sex for Grade) vindicates him of any legal wrongdoings, several fresh reports have come up against him with many former students ready to testify against him. Complaints were made against some lecturers who left some University of Ghana departments to take up government posts.</p>
      <p>The University is expected to take a decision on the former students’ complaints against these lecturers which also include several high-ranking officials, past and present Deans, Hall Masters, department heads, and Tutors of the University.</p>
      <p>It was shockingly discovered that most current students have no confidence in the University’s sexual harassment committee to adequately protect them, they have no been forthcoming. Former students dominate the complaints with many willing to publicly testify about their ordeals at the hand of Gyampo, Butakor, one Wiafe, among over 23 lecturers some of whom have moved on and taken appointment in government.</p>
      <p>Attempts to cover up</p>
      <p>Another high-ranking University of Ghana official serving on the committee suspects the University intends to shelve the other shocking details of the report to protect the University’s image instead of its students.</p>
      <p>According to the source, thousands of emails were sent by mostly former students to the announced complaint email against specifically named lecturers some of whom the University may not want to name.</p>
      <p>“They won’t make the report public, I doubt it. Even me as a member i don’t have a copy, but I know what we found and wrote in the report. It is a big worry for me as a parent and all parents must be concerned. It will be scandalous if made public. The emails especially”.</p>
      <p>MyNewsGh.com was told the University wants to believe some of the email contents were “made-up” by thr former students over past grievances, especially where there is no evidence or witnesses. Our source believes this is part of the cover-up plot to be expected.</p>
      <p>“If the University wants students to have confidence to report, they must be seen to be taking things seriously and not do injustice to the victims by putting its image, not victims’ pain first”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Vice Chancellor, Chancellor speak.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prof Owusu, who was addressing the November 2019 Congregation of UG said: “Following the broadcast, management set up a five-member fact-finding committee chaired by her ladyship retired Justice Vida Akoto-Bamfo to conduct an inquiry into the matter. I am happy to inform you that the committee submitted its report to the Vice-Chancellor on Tuesday, 12 November 2019”.</p>
      <p>He was quick to add that: “Management will, therefore, study the report and ensure implementation of the recommendations using the appropriate processes stipulated in our basic laws and policies of the University”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Chancellor of the university, Mrs Mary Chinery-Hesse reiterated the tertiary institution’s zero-tolerance policy for sexual misconduct.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the November 2019 Congregation of the university, Mrs Chinery-Hesse urged the students to report cases of sexual violation and assured them of the university’s protection.</p>
      <p>“The university management is fully committed to ensuring that the campus environment will be completely free from all forms of sexual harassment. The University of Ghana will not condone any form of sexual harassment,” she emphasised.</p>
