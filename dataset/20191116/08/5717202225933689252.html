      <h1>England’s players reportedly want Joe Gomez to start match against Kosovo</h1>
      <h2>The defender was booed at Wembley against Kosovo.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:15:23+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Joe Gomez’s England team-mates want him to start this Sunday’s match against Kosovo after he was booed at Wembley in the 7-0 win over Montenegro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/joe-gomez-left-devastated-wembley-boos-gareth-southgate-seeks/">According to the Telegraph</a>, Three Lions players feel that the part way to show solidarity would be for both Gomez and Raheem Sterling to start tomorrow’s dead rubber.</p>
      <p>Gomez hasn’t started an England game since the Nations League third/fourth placed play-off against Switzerland in June and has struggled for gametime at Liverpool this season.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/joe-gomez-left-devastated-wembley-boos-gareth-southgate-seeks/">report</a> says he was devastated by the reception he got at Wembley and Gareth Southgate and England coach Chris Powell – who knows him well from his time at Charlton – spent time with him post-match.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Gomez needs full backing from England over booing which is not his fault at all</h3>
      <p>Fans booing their own players is rarely a good look and it’s completely braindead in this instance given that Gomez has done absolutely nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>He needs everyone to do with the England setup to rally around him and show solidarity and playing him against Kosovo could well be one way to do that.</p>
      <p>The togetherness in the camp is one of the England side’s greatest strengths and it needs to be in full sight this weekend.</p>
