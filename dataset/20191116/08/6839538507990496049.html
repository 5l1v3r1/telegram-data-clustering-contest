      <p>A brave woman sexually assaulted while she slept has chased her attacker after waking to a man in her bedroom during a sickening home invasion at Seaford Meadows overnight.</p>
      <p>Special Crime Investigation detectives are hunting a man with a muscular build and short thick hair after he sexually assaulted the victim at her home – near Grand Blvd – just before 1.30am on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Ian Humby said the intruder entered through an unlocked door.</p>
      <p>“Once she woke up, the assault ended and she chased him outside the house,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s very disturbing and of course, what makes it worse, the time of night.</p>
      <p>“The victim doesn’t know who the offender is… (but) she’s still helping us as best she can.”</p>
      <p>After the attack, the victim then realised her purse, mobile phone and other personal items had been stolen.</p>
      <p>A police dog was used to scour the area but the suspect’s scent could not be traced.</p>
      <p>He is about 170cms tall and was wearing a dark blue or black T-shirt.</p>
      <p>Det Insp Humby said officers are still for searching clues, but pleaded with the man to “do the decent thing” and hand himself in.</p>
      <p>“The trauma that is associated with this type of offending has often long-lasting effects psychologically and sometimes emotionally, and physically as well,” he said.</p>
      <p>The woman is being consoled by family and friends.</p>
      <p>Neighbours have spoken of their shock and said police told them to keep their doors locked.</p>
      <p>“An officer told us if see anything suspicious, to call them straight away,” a mother said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve lived her for a number of years and not had any issues.”</p>
      <p>Officers walked surrounding streets and spoke to residents in the area on Saturday morning. The suburb, which has recently been developed, is home to mostly families and elderly residents.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the incident, including persons or vehicles seen in the Seaford Meadows area about the time of the attack, is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.</p>
