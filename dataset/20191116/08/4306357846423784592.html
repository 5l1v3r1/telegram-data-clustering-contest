      <h3>Frank Lampard is eager to appoint Premier League legend Shay Given to his Chelsea FC coaching staff to help Kepa Arrizabalaga, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7687131/Chelsea-boss-Frank-Lampard-make-Shay-Given-amid-concerns-Kepa-Arrizabalaga.html">The Daily Mail</a> is reporting that the Chelsea FC manager is prepared to make another attempt to convince Given to take up a goalkeeping role at the west London outfit.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Lampard wanted Given when he was appointed as Maurizio Sarri’s replacement in the summer but the former Republic of Ireland international didn’t follow Lampard, Jody Morris and Chris Jones to Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the Blues board blocked Lampard’s bid to bring Given to Chelsea FC as they wanted to promote Henrique Hilario to the vacant role.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> report goes on to add that Lampard wants to make another attempt to lure Given to Chelsea FC after the former Newcastle goalkeeper remained at Derby beyond the summer to work with Philipp Cocu.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Kepa’s ability to handle set-pieces has left some members of the Chelsea FC star worried.</p>
      <p>The Blues signed Kepa in a world-record £71.6m deal from Spanish side Athletic Bilbao in 2018 to replace Thibaut Courtois.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC finished in third sport in the Premier League last term.</p>
