                <h3>Mitchell McClenaghan likes fan’s tweet</h3>
                <p>Defending champions Mumbai Indians have an 18-member squad at this point in time. It is worth mentioning that Indians had traded all-rounder <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/mumbai-indians-swap-mayank-markande-with-sherfane-rutherford-from-delhi-capitals/">Sherfane Rutherford</a> (from Delhi Capitals) and fast bowlers in Trent Boult (from Delhi Capitals) and <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/mumbai-indians-news-mi-acquire-dhawal-kulkarni-from-rajasthan-royals-for-ipl-2020/">Dhawal Kulkarni</a> (from Rajasthan Royals) during the window. Among the only outgoing player was batsman Siddesh Lad who was acquired by Kolkata Knight Riders.</p>
                <p>New Zealand fast bowler Mitchell McClenaghan, who has been with MI since 2015, was among the players who were retained by them. Resultantly, Mumbai only have two overseas slots to fill for IPL 2020.</p>

                      <p>McClenaghan allured limelight after he liked an Indians’ fan’s tweet which claimed Royal Challengers Bangalore’s captain Virat Kohli as McClenaghan’s “bunny”. The tweet was posted to MI, suggesting them to not release McClenaghan before the auction.</p>

                          <p>Since the start of IPL 2015, Kohli has got out against Indians on eight occasions. Out of those eight, Kohli lost his wicket to McClenaghan four times.</p>

                            <p>The 33-year old left-arm fast bowler was released before the auction by MI in IPL 2018 but was included in the team once again as Australia fast bowler Jason Behrendorff’s replacement.</p>
