      <p>England Women conceded a last-minute try to go down 20-16 to Papua New Guinea and draw their two-match Test series with the Orchids.</p>
      <p>Buoyed by a 24-10 victory in Goroka, the tourists made the perfect start at the national stadium in Port Moresby with a try after one minute from centre Tara-Jane Stanley, who then kicked a penalty to make it 6-0.</p>
      <p>Tries from Carol Humei and Belinda Gwasamum and a conversion from Erswin Kaiat enabled the Kumuls to lead 10-6 at the break and Roswita Kapo added a third two minutes into the second half as they extended the lead to 16-6.</p>
      <p>England looked to have secured a draw when captain Emily Rudge and Naomi Williams added further tries and Stanley kicked her first conversion but stand-off Shirley Joe broke the England defence and with it their hearts when she darted over for the match-winning try.</p>
      <p>It clinched a first-ever win for the Orchids but it was marred somewhat by a biting allegation made by Rudge in the first half which referee Chris Butler put on report.</p>
