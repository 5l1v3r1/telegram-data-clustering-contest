      <p>Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of brandishing a BB gun in public.</p>
      <p>Police were called to a report of people 'acting suspiciously' in High Pavement in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Sutton-in-Ashfield</a>.</p>
      <p>It happened just after 12.05pm on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>Two boys, aged 14 and 16, were arrested on suspicion of possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.</p>
      <p>Officers also recovered a BB gun.</p>
      <p>The two boys remain in police custody.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Steve Wragg, from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a>, said: "We are not looking for anyone else in connection with this isolated incident.</p>
      <p>"We treat any reports involving firearms extremely seriously. Even imitation firearms have the potential to cause fear and distress and we will not tolerate people carrying weapons of any kind on our streets."</p>
      <p>The teenagers have now been released on conditional bail</p>
