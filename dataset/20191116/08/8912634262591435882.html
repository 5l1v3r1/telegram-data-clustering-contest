      <p>BEIRUT: S&amp;P Global Ratings Friday downgraded Lebanon’s sovereign debt, saying a twin political and economic crisis had hit investor confidence and constrained the government’s funding model, which relies on deposit inflows.<br/>The move to lower the protest-hit country’s credit ratings to ‘CCC/C’ from ‘B-/B’ with a negative outlook came one day after S&amp;P said it had downgraded three Lebanese banks.<br/>It also came after Moody’s rating agency downgraded Lebanon’s sovereign debt earlier this month, saying sweeping anti-government protests had hit investor confidence and threatened macro-economic stability.<br/>The demonstrations have rocked Lebanon since October 17, forcing the government to resign last month and banks to close.<br/>They were fueled in part by fears of a currency devaluation and a dollar shortage after banks restricted access to the greenback, causing the exchange rate to spike on the black market.<br/>ATMs no longer dispense dollar bills and banks have capped the amount that can be withdrawn from branches or transferred abroad.<br/>As a result, the exchange rate in the parallel market has surpassed 1,800 Lebanese pounds for every dollar — a spike from the pegged rate of 1,500.<br/>On Friday, S&amp;P said, “diminishing confidence in Lebanon’s governance and economy have led to a reversal in bank deposit inflows, which have historically financed Lebanon’s elevated fiscal and external deficits.”<br/>“Bank closures and unofficial foreign currency transfer restrictions raise questions about the sustainability of the exchange rate regime, further eroding confidence,” it added in a statement on its website.<br/>Even before the protests began, growth in Lebanon had plummeted in the wake of repeated political deadlocks in recent years, compounded by the war in Syria.<br/>Public debt stood at more than $86 billion, or higher than 150 percent of GDP, according to the finance ministry.<br/>S&amp;P on Friday said it expects the general government deficit will average 11.6% of GDP over 2019-2022 and gross general government debt will increase to 169% of GDP by 2022.<br/>It also called for the formation of a technocratic government — a key demand of the country’s protest movement.<br/>“If a new, largely technocratic government is formed within the next month and is able to introduce immediate policy reforms... this could help defuse social tensions and support depositor confidence.”</p>
