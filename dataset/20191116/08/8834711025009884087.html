      <h1>UN Refugee Agency To Assist Vulnerable Foreign Nationals In Pretoria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:57:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>The United Nations (UN) Refugee Agency says it will be assisting vulnerable refugees with shelter, counselling and cash help them get back on their feet after the raid in Pretoria.</p>
      <p>On Friday, police removed refugees that had been living outside the offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Pretoria.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, they gained access illegally to the premises, prompting the police action.</p>
      <p>Despite the refugees having lived on Waterkloof Road with minimal assistance from the refugee agency, it now says it’s ready to assist asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>But a woman who is amongst the relocated groups said she has lost all hope in the system. <br/>“We already asked them we want to go out of this country. We want to go out of South Africa, any place. We don’t like South Africa.”</p>
