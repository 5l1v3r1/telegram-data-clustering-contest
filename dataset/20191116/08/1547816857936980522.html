        <b>Bhushan Kumar is set to take another cult comedy film Chupke Chupke that starred Dharmendra, Sharmila Tagore, and Amitabh Bachchan which will now be remade starring Rajkummar Rao</b>

      <p>As we live in an era of remakes, Bollywood is going to see another remake and that is going to be Hrishikesh Mukerjee’s cult comedy, Chupke Chupke that starred Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, and Sharmila Tagore. The film was considered to be one of the best comedy films in Hindi cinema but now the film will be remade again with Rajkummar Rao who will be essaying the role of Dr Parimal Tripathi which was originally donned by Dharmendra. As the legendary actor had set a benchmark with his par excellence performance, Rajkummar says that <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/rajkummar-rao-on-essaying-dharmendra-s-role-in-chupke-chupke-remake-it-s-a-big-responsibility/5da6c16887fb571eff7e2908">it’s a big responsibility to step into his shoes.</a></p>
      <p>Rajkummar also said that the scripting is underway right now but the makers realized that the title Chupke Chupke is taken by Manish Goswami for his production house long ago. However, it is now reported that Manish has parted with the title for the remake, claims Mumbai Mirror report. A source close to the tabloid was quoted saying that when Bhushan Kumar’s company approached him, he immediately issued a ‘No Objection’ letter to the Film and Television Producers Guild of India as he didn’t have a suitable script ready. </p>

      <p>To which Manish was quoted, “We’re industry colleagues, so, we should help one another in times of need.” The tabloid stated that Manish has earlier given the title Dream Girl to Ekta Kapoor for her Ayushmann Khurrana and Nushrat Bharucha starrer.</p>
