      <h1>Arsenal: When do you worry about Rob Holding?</h1>
      <h2>Rob Holding has not performed at his best upon his return from an ACL tear. When is it fair to begin worrying about the Arsenal defender’s performances?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:44+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/andrewdowdeswell/" target="_blank">Andrew Dowdeswell</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=rob+holding">Rob Holding</a> has been heralded by fans as the future of the <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> defence. He performed admirably in the opening stages of Unai Emery’s first season in charge, hinting that he might be ready for a more prominent role in the team. Then, just as his prospects were looking their brightest, an untimely ACL tear.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/pain-in-the-arsenal-podcast-on-arsenal-fc/id1314514440?ign-mpt=uo%3D4%26amp%3Buo%3D4&amp;mt=2">Find the latest episode of the Pain in the Arsenal Podcast here — Can we talk about something else?</a>

      <p>Holding has since only just returned from a long and arduous rehabilitation process. He made his first Premier League start prior to the international break in the 2-0 defeat to Leicester City, while also making five appearances in the EFL Cup and Europa League.</p>
      <p>With David Luiz and Sokratis, the incumbent starting centre-half pair in Holding’s absence, struggling early on in the season, the Gunners conceding a mire of silly goals as a result of their lapse defending, it was largely believed that Holding might be more than just a prospect for the future of the backline. He might also be the saviour of the present iteration, a role the Gunners were desperate for him to play.</p>
      <p>However, since his return to the team, bar his opening performance against Nottingham Forest in which he was hardly tested as Arsenal dominated the possession and had very little defending to do throughout, Holding has not looked especially comfortable. This was especially true when used on the left side of a back three against Leicester last weekend, his lack of natural athleticism exposed. Contrast his performance to Calum Chambers, who possesses that vital quickness, on the other side and it was clear to see where his issues lay.</p>

      <p>At this early stage, it is futile to doubt whether Holding can return to the player he was before the injury and eventually grow into his role as a leading character in the defence. He has played a handful of matches after a year out of the game. Moreover, he is not exactly joining a confident team, making it harder for a centre-back, a position that relies on the competency of the rest of the team, to impress.</p>
      <p>However, while all that is true, and necessary to keep in mind, at some point, Holding’s performances should take an uptick. Given his struggles thus far, it is fair to wonder if and when that time will be and when it is justifiable to worry about his overall prospects this season and beyond.</p>
      <p>After all, ACL tears have ended careers in the past. While medical advancements have helped recoveries from major injuries like this no end, it can be difficult to regain that top-end speed and acceleration, skills that are exceptionally important in the increasingly fast-paced modern game.</p>
      <p>Holding is far from done and dusted, and I still have confidence that he can one day forge a starting role for himself in the Arsenal defence. But the early signs of his recovery are not exactly ideal and that does present at least some cause for concern.</p>
