      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a> is swapping her cosy family home for life in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> jungle.</p>
      <p>She's leaving behind her comfy sofa, plush kitchen and her daughters' colourful bedrooms and moving into a hammock, suspended over crawling critters, and into a life of sharing a grubby outdoor toilet with nine other people.</p>
      <p>So exactly what kind of luxury is Jacqueline leaving behind?</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star, 27, lives in Kent with her husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> , an their two daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline regularly gives fans a glimpse inside her stunning home, sharing snaps of herself and the girls.</p>

      <p>Just last month, Jacqueline showed off her gorgeous new marble dining table that's surrounded by six plush grey crushed velvet chairs with back rings to prevent them from being ruined by children's sticky hands.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline's kitchen is roomy, with sparkling pearl-coloured tiled floors with matching counter tops and grey drawers and cupboards.</p>
      <p>She has an American-style two-door fridge, surely packed with treats and healthy snacks to keep her girls happy.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline's house also features a separate laundry room, helping keep the place nice and tidy.</p>
      <p>In the living room, Jac has a large brown corduroy sofa that looks good enough to sink into.</p>

      <p>She regularly cuddles up on the settee with her girls and Dan for a selfie.</p>
      <p>Jac loves treating her girls, and recently unveiled Ella's brand new Toy Story room.</p>
      <p>Her single bed is adorned with Toy Story bedding and cushions and plenty of cuddly toys.</p>
      <p>She also has matching curtains and her very own toy box, decorated with white and blue stripes, her name in pink lettering and a comfy pink cushion to sit on on top.</p>
      <p>Baby Mia has her very own toy box too.</p>
      <p>It's painted in pink and white stripes and bears her name and a tiny pink crown as well as love hearts and a plush seat on top.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Out in the garden, there's a raised deck complete with plenty of rattan garden furniture to help the family make the most of the sunshine when it comes around.</p>
      <p>There's also grass where the girls can play and plenty or colour thanks to the plants and flowers potted around all over the place.</p>
      <p>Jac is sure to miss her home comforts while she's away, but it's not the first time a TV show has separated her and former TOWIE star Dan.</p>
      <p>He took part in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> last year, but later said it had saved their marriage.</p>

      <p>The series was shrouded in controversy thanks to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-roxanne-pallett-celebrity-big-13077570">Roxanne Pallett</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-ryan-thomas-celebrity-big-13078203">Ryan Thomas</a> Punchgate scandal.</p>
      <p>But Dan remembers it for a whole other reason.</p>
      <p>Before heading in he'd face a number of cheating allegations and had split from Jacqueline while she was pregnant with their second child.</p>
      <p>He entered the house not long after Jacqueline had given birth, to find he'd be living with former Love Island star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , who he was accused of cheating on Jac with.</p>
      <p>But Dan set the record straight, saying he and Gabby were just good friends and him and Jacqueline were very much back on.</p>

      <p>And after getting out of the house and returning home, he said they were stronger than ever.</p>
      <p>Dan, who is also dad to Teddy from a previous relationship, told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/">OK!</a> magazine at the time: "Our relationship is better now than it’s ever been. Since getting back together, it feels like we’re stronger and we appreciate each other so much more.</p>
      <p>"In a way we have a lot to thank CBB for, because the time apart made us realise what we were both missing. Things between us are really good right now, it feels like we’re newlyweds again."</p>

      <p>Jac added: "This is very much a delayed honeymoon for us.</p>
      <p>"Our relationship went through a difficult patch this year but now we’re back on track and we wanted to do something to mark our fresh start."</p>
      <p>* I'm A Celebrity kicks off at 9pm on Sunday on ITV</p>
