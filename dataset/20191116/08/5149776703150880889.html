      <h1>Pierre van Hooijdonk's reason for going on strike at Nottingham Forest was 'spot on' says ex-Red</h1>
      <h2>Former Reds midfielder Andy Johnson says he sympathised with the Dutch striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach</a></address>
      <p>Ex-Nottingham Forest midfielder Andy Johnson says he and his teammates sympathised with Pierre van Hooijdonk's decision to go on strike while at the City Ground, but did not commend his actions.</p>
      <p>The striker famously refused to return to pre-season training after seeing a number of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a>'s high-profile stars leave during the summer, including his attacking sidekick Kevin Campbell.</p>
      <p>Once the club's record signing, van Hooijdonk was crowned Reds player of the year in 1998 but after forcing his exit never played in England again and instead flourished in his native Holland</p>
      <p>There he would win the golden boot in both the Eredivise and the UEFA cup as well as being named Dutch footballer of the year.</p>
      <p>Forest, meanwhile, were relegated from the Premier League, finishing dead last with their lowest moment being an embarrassing 8-1 home defeat to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>“The club sold our best players," said Johnson, speaking to <a href="https://seatpitch.co.uk/2019/04/05/nottingham-forest-andy-johnson-pierre-van-hooijdonk/">Seat Pitch</a>. "Campbell went, Colin Cooper left, Scot Gemmill and Steve Stone were sold during the season and we were all thinking ‘hold on a minute this is a time to build on the squad, not go selling our best players’.</p>
      <p>“Pierre went on strike and never came back for pre-season. We all agreed with him in terms of the direction the club was going.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t agree with him leaving us in the lurch and having to start our season without a star striker but we all felt the same as him in terms of the club selling the best players.</p>

      <p>“Looking back I don’t agree with him physically striking but we all know why he did. He wanted to make a stand against the club and in that sense he was spot on.</p>
      <p>“We lost 8-1!," he continued, "8-1! We didn’t just get beat we got thrashed, it was completely humiliating.</p>
      <p>“As players we held it against the club, who had put us in such a situation by stripping us of our best players.”</p>
