      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:21:36+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Actor Joaquin Phoenix says he took a conscious decision to not address the controversy around the violent themes of his recent feature Joker as he feared that it might actually lead to extreme incidents.</p>
      <p>The film had received unanimous praise for Phoenix’s acting as Joker, a villain in the Batman comic mythology but detractors believe his portrayal hits too close to home in a country where gun violence is a real issue.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Phoenix said he felt blindsided by the criticism coming towards film’s way.</p>
      <p>“It was an awkward position to be in. Because I thought, ‘Well, I can’t address this because this is the thing that is potentially part of the problem that’s precisely what you shouldn’t do.’</p>
      <p>“So it suddenly seemed like I was being evasive and trying to avoid this topic because it made me uncomfortable. But really I was thinking, this is the very thing that would excite this kind of personality'” Phoenix said.</p>
      <p>Families of victims who were killed in the 2012 mass shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, during the screening Batman film The Dark Knight Rises, had written a letter to Warner Bros, the studio behind Joker, calling for donations to gun-victim charities because the film “presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story”.</p>
      <p>Warner Bros had defended the film, saying the aim of storytelling is to “provoke difficult conversations around complex issues.”</p>
      <p>In September, Phoenix had walked out of an interview with the UK’s The Telegraph when questioned about the violence in the film. He later told a publication that the audience is capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong.</p>
