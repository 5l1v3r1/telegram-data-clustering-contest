        <b>Bhumi Pednekar opens up about giving three back-to-back superhits – Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan and now Bala with Ayushmann Khurrana</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bhumi Pednekar and Ayushmann Khurrana are proving to be one of the most loved jodis of Bollywood in recent times. They have been paired together thrice and they have a brilliant 100 percent hit record as they have delivered three back to back superhits – Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan and now Bala. <br/><br/>Talking about giving consecutive hits Bhumi told a section of media, “Ayushmann and I are definitely a fortunate on-screen Jodi to be getting so much love and adulation for audiences. We complement each other as artistes and we do have a very good on-screen chemistry. It just shows and I’m just glad that people have loved us as a pair and we have just done 3 films together.” <b>(ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/reviews/bala-movie-review-strees-yami-gautam-and-bhumi-pednekar-give-ayushmann-khurrana-a-run-for-his-money-in-what-s-quite-funny/5dc4465287fb571eff7e38f1">Bala, Movie Review: Strees Yami Gautam And Bhumi Pednekar Give Ayushmann Khurrana A Run For His Money In What's Quite Funny</a>)</b></p>

      <p>The versatile actress further added, “We both have grown as actors during the course of our three back to back films. I cherish him as a friend and a co-star and I wish the best for him always. As an on-screen Jodi, Ayushmann and I have done some edgy films and thankfully audiences have loved us in them. From Dum Lag Ke Haisha (dealing with body shaming) to Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan (about erectile dysfunction in men) to Bala (about premature balding and the stereotyping that dark-skinned women face in India), we have only been paired in films that tackle taboo topics so I think the equity of our pairing lies in bringing out real, societal issues told in the most honest and entertaining manner possible.” <b>(ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/Bollywood-interviews/bhumi-pednekar-unfiltered-on-controversies-of-bala-saand-ki-aankh-and-pati-patni-aur-woh-exclusive/5dc5810287fb571eff7e39a4">Bhumi Pednekar UNFILTERED On Controversies Of Bala, Saand Ki Aankh And Pati Patni Aur Woh- EXCLUSIVE</a>)</b></p>

      <p>Of course, Bhumi wants to extend her hit record with Ayushmann. “I’m thrilled with the box office run that we as a pair are having and I hope and pray that we continue this golden streak! It is a rare thing for anyone and I’m just happy that this streak is with one of the closest friends of mine,” she asserted.<br/><br/><i>Images Source: funasianet.com</i></p>
