        <b>The former New York mayor has now started a hefty ad campaign targeting US swing and battlefield states, where Donald Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. The move, however, has been interpreted as a start to a grand 2020 campaign, especially given his partner’s decision to swap camps.</b>

      <p>Media mogul and former Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s girlfriend, Diana Taylor, a long-time Republican, re-registered as a Democrat in October 2018 - at the time he first floated the idea of running for president in 2020, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/michael-bloombergs-gal-pal-re-registered-as-democrat-last-year/">the New York Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Years earlier, Taylor herself considered a 2010 Senate run as a Republican, the edition noted.</p>
      <p>The move filed with the Board of Elections came around the same time as the billionaire changed his registration from independent to Democrat in a bid to challenge POTUS Trump.</p>
      <p>While the ex-New York mayor, who also had a brief stint as a Republican from 2001 to 2003, has yet to register as a candidate, his former colleagues and current mayors seem to be applauding the potential move, by default:</p>
      <blockquote>“If Mike Bloomberg runs for president, he will command the support of current and former mayors across America. I would be one of them”, said former Miami Beach, Florida, Mayor Philip Levine, who is running for governor as a Democrat in Florida.</blockquote>
      <p>“As a fellow mayor, Mike was and is considered one of the greatest mayors in history”, he added. “If he throws his hat in the ring, I believe he would present the president with the most formidable challenge in the field”, Levin enthusiastically remarked.</p>
      <p>Michael Bloomberg's final decision on a presidential run is "days, not weeks" away, Axios wrote on Friday citing an unnamed source, adding an announcement is expected before Thanksgiving.</p>
      <blockquote>The source familiar with the tycoon’s plans said the former New York mayor's funding of a $100 million, digital, anti-Trump ad series is "a step toward running for Mike, not a step away from running”, and that “he is actively preparing”.</blockquote>
      <p>The ad campaign was first reported by The New York Times, and it is aimed at helping whoever wins the Democratic nomination kick-start general election campaigning as early as possible to target the Trump juggernaut in such battleground states as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.</p>
