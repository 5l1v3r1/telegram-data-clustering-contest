      <h1>“A difficult decision”: Bobby Duncan speaks out on his controversial switch to Fiorentina</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:33:26+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Bobby Duncan, who departed the Reds for Italy over the summer in less than amicable circumstances, has spoken out on the reasons behind him forcing the move.</p>
      <p>Duncan has scored four times in 10 games for Fiorentina’s U19s but is yet to feature for the first team. Had he stayed on Merseyside for a little longer, he would have been with Neil Critchley and the U23s, while he could also have played in the Carabao Cup under Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.violanation.com/2019/11/15/20959054/fiorentina-player-spotlight-a-conversation-with-primavera-star-bobby-duncan">ViolaNation.com</a>: <b>“It was a difficult decision, to be honest. I was in a difficult moment at that time. Something was missing. It wasn’t over money. It wasn’t over anything else other than I want to play first-team football soon.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“In my mind, I thought I would go and play abroad. Serie A is just below the Premier League. I wanted to make a name for myself, show the Liverpool and Fiorentina fans who I am.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I always loved Liverpool, but my love now is to the Fiorentina fans. I didn’t see the path forward for me [at Anfield].”</b>
      </p>
      <p>He might not have seen a way forward to the first-team immediately under Klopp, but admitting that Serie A is below the Premier League is not likely to go down well over in his new home.</p>
      <p>There is no mention of his mental health, either, which was a key part of the reasoning given by his agent, Saif Rubie, at the time his departure exploded.</p>
      <p>Duncan remains an exceptional talent and it is a shame that he left in the manner that he did, but the Reds have other top prospects in his position, such as Rhian Brewster and Paul Glatzel.</p>
