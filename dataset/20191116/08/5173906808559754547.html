        <b>Portugal's GDP grew 0.3% in the third quarter, compared to the previous three months, half of that recorded in the second quarter, maintaining the pace of growth of 1.9%, compared to the same period of 2018, Statistics Portugal (INE) reported</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the INE's quick estimate, compared to the second quarter of 2019, GDP increased by 0.3% in real terms (a quarter-on-quarter change of 0.6% in the previous quarter), reflecting the positive contribution of domestic demand to the quarter-on-quarter change in GDP, higher than that recorded in the second quarter, and the more intense negative contribution of net external demand.</p>
      <p>In year-on-year terms, the INE said that domestic demand made a positive contribution to the year-on-year change in GDP like that recorded in the second quarter, with an acceleration of private consumption, while investment recorded less intense growth.</p>
