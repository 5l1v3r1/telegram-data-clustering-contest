      <h1>Taylor Swift among Billboard's top 10 artists of all time, right after Michael Jackson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:21:58+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Several names make it to Billboards top charts every week, several others end up being called the top albums of the month, depending on tabulated data from the weekly popularity of songs and albums in the United States and elsewhere. However, only a few have landed the list of Billboard’s top ten artists of all time, with rarely any recent pop sensations making it to the charts, until now.</p>
      <p>With Taylor Swift ranking number eight, just below Michael Jackson on number seven and right above Stevie Wonder on number nine, she has become the first among artists of her age to debut the Billboard’s top artists of all time, that too, after only a fifteen-year-long career.</p>

      <p>While Mariah Carey maintains the highest-ranked female on the list since the longest time now, it seems <i>The Man</i> singer, followed by her ‘swifties’ is aiming for bigger things.</p>
      <p>Billboard unveiled its list of <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8543378/billboard-top-125-artists-of-all-time-the-beatles?utm_source=instagram&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-billboard&amp;utm_content=later-4003591">Top 125 Artists of All-Time</a>, to celebrate its monumental 125th anniversary, based on the history of its hot 100 song charts and Billboard’s 200 top albums. To tease fans before revealing the entire list, Billboard initially revealed the top ten on social media and left everyone baffled.</p>
      <p>The Beatles have maintained the number one position, being the only band to have crowned the charts 20 times in the 61 years of its dominance. The Rolling Stones follows them on number two, powered by their nine albums that made it to Billboard’s Top 200 — moving onto Elton John on number three, Mariah Carey on number four, Madonna on number five, Barbara Streisand on number six, Micheal Jackson on number seven, Taylor Swift on number eight, Stevie Wonder on number nine and Chicago on number ten.</p>
      <p>Billboard reportedly came up with the rankings using a formula blending all titles calculated on both the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart and the Billboard 200 albums chart from 1958 until the present. The result is a list of music’s all-time top artists based on sales and chart performance.</p>
