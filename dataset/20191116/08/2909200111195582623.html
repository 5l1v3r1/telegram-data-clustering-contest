        <b>Special Prosecutor Martin Alamisi Benz Kaiser Amidu is not enthused the least about what he considers disrespect shown him by Deputy Attorney General Godfred Dame who is younger than his (Amidu’s) son.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The writer cum Special Prosecutor has come under attack from the Deputy AG who has accused Mr. Amidu of taking to the press matters which should be decided in court.</p>
      <p>Following their appearance in court together on the Waterville matter, their differences were settled to which the sitting Judge asked Godfred Dame to later go and see Mr. Amidu for further discussion.</p>
      <p>Godfred Dame agreed to cooperate with Mr. Amidu. But Amidu will have noneof that if the young Godfred Dame will not show him respect first.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t respect me you can’t come to me”, he fired at Godfred Dame. “My son is even older than you. You don’t respect” he pointed at the Deputy AG.</p>
      <p>It will be recalled that the Special Prosecutor, Martin Alamisi Amidu, in his capacity as a private citizen dragged the Attorney General and construction firm, Waterville to the Supreme Court over the nonenforcement of a judgement debt retrieval order directed at the Government of Ghana and the company in 2013. He filed the suit in September this year.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court on June 14, 2013, in a case brought before it by Mr. Amidu, against the Attorney General, Waterville Holding and Woyome in a €47,365,624 judgment debt case directed the Government of Ghana to retrieve the money from the respondents.</p>
      <p>Martin Amidu, a former Attorney General, who dragged Waterville to court argued that the company had no contract with the government of Ghana but yet made claims for the payment of the money.</p>
      <p>Mr. Amidu lost. The court ruled his suit as incompetent.</p>
