      <p>On Wednesday, House Lessans was revealed as the 2019 winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) House of the Year prize, chosen from a shortlist of seven architect-designed homes in the UK.</p>
      <p>The dwelling, which McGonigle McGrath built on the site of an old farmstead in County Down, was <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/11/13/house-lessans-mcgonigle-mcgrath-riba-house-year-2019/">referred to by RIBA president Alan Jones as "a dream home"</a> executed with "incredible clarity and restraint".</p>
