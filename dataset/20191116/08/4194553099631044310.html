      <h1>Rent free! Liverpool have bought Jurgen Klopp’s house – and will let him live there for nothing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T08:02:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have bought a house in Formby belonging to former manager Brendan Rodgers, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7690841/AHEAD-GAME-Liverpool-buy-Rodgers-house-3-75m-allow-Klopp-live-rent-free.html">Daily Mail</a>, and will let Jurgen Klopp live in it for nothing.</p>
      <p>Klopp had been renting it from the Leicester City boss but with the property, a seven-bedroom mansion, up for sale, the club decided to purchase it and use it for the German to live in, and for future managers too.</p>
      <p>Purchasing the house cost £3.75 million and the club view it as an investment for the future, with future bosses able to use it as well, as has now almost become a tradition, and the value only likely to increase.</p>
      <p>With Klopp so far unwilling to sign a new contract because he is unsure on how long he wants to stay at the club with his current deal set to run out in summer 2022, this could be a way for the club to reward him for his success without his contract being lengthened.</p>
