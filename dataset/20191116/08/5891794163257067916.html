      <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has been hospitalized after experiencing heart problems.</p>
      <p>A statement issued on November 16 by his office said Vucic had been admitted to the military hospital in Belgrade, the capital, on November 15.</p>
      <p>Vucic, 49, is a former extreme nationalist who now wishes to lead Serbia into the European Union.</p>
      <p>Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive Party ascended to power in 2012. Vucic has been Serbia's president since 2017.</p>
      <p>The populist leader has since faced accusations of curbing media freedoms and democracy.</p>
      <p>Vucic’s government has strengthened Serbia’s close relations with traditional Slavic ally Russia.</p>
