        <b>Des vents violents menacent de s’abattre samedi sur la ville italienne de Venise, deux jours après que les autorités ont décrété l’état d’urgence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Venise se préparait samedi à vivre une nouvelle alerte météorologique. Jeudi les autorités ont décrété l’état d’urgence dans la Cité des Doges dévastée par des inondations records.</p>
      <p>La protection civile italienne a ainsi émis pour samedi une «alerte rouge» météorologique pour toute la région de Venise, avertissant du risque de vents violents.</p>

      <p>Un nouveau coup dur pour la «Sérénissime», où son maire Luigi Brugnaro avait déjà été contraint vendredi d’ordonner la fermeture de la célèbre place Saint-Marc pendant plusieurs heures avant de lever cette mesure dans l’après-midi, au moment où le niveau de l’eau baissait.</p>
      <p>L’«acqua alta», ou marée haute, a atteint vendredi 1,54 mètre. Mardi soir, Venise avait connu sa pire marée haute en 53 ans (1,87m, soit le deuxième record historique derrière celui du 4 novembre 1966 (1,94 m). L’eau a envahi les églises, commerces, musées et hôtels de ce joyau classé au patrimoine mondial.</p>
      <h3>Grosses intempéries en Italie: près d'1 m 50 d'eau sur la place St-Marc à Venise</h3>
