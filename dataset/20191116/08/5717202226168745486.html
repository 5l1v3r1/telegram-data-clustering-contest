      <h1>Tottenham fans mock Christian Eriksen after Denmark performance</h1>

      <p>Christian Eriksen played in Denmark’s 6-0 win over Gibraltar on Friday – and some Tottenham fans on Twitter ripped into him for his performance.</p>
      <p>The Spurs playmaker scored two late goals for his nation in the European Championship qualifier.</p>
      <p>He’s currently one of the players under the spotlight from Spurs fans this campaign, as his form has massively dropped off and he’s out of contract at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The North London club fear the 27-year-old will leave on a free transfer next summer (<a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/danny-rose-could-trigger-tottenham-20875638">Daily Star</a>) and many feel his head is already elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Eriksen has played 14 games across all competitions so far this season at club level, scoring just two goals and supplying one assist.</p>
      <p>The attacking midfielder has been one of the key players during the Mauricio Pochettino reign, but he looks a shadow of his former self and there appears to be an underlying issue.</p>

      <p>A selection of Spurs supporters on social media accused him of making more effort for the national team following his brace on Friday.</p>
      <p>It will be intriguing to see if he can return after the international break with a renewed belief and the team could desperately do with him reigniting his best form while he’s still around.</p>
      <p>Here are some Spurs fans on Eriksen:</p>
