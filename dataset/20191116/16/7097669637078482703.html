      <h1>A super-vaccine for the flu is being marketed to people 65 and older. Is it legit or a scam?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:35:27+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/" target="_blank">Adrianna Rodriguez, USA TODAY</a></address>
      <p>Flu season is upon us, and the demographic most vulnerable to the disease is people 65 and older.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, about 70%-80% of seasonal flu-related deaths occur in this age group.</p>
      <p> The regular flu vaccine just won't cut it, some doctors say.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/expert-answers/fluzone/faq-20058032">James Steckelberg of the Mayo Clinic said</a> people 65 and over should be administered high-dose vaccines to stimulate their immune system.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa_fluzone.htm">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> has licensed two high-dose vaccines to people 65 and older: Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD.</p>
      <h3>What are Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD? </h3>
      <p>Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that although the two vaccines have the same outcome, they work a little differently.</p>
      <p>Fluzone High-Dose contains four times the antigen that's in a standard dose, effectively making it a stronger version of the regular flu shot. FLUAD pairs the regular vaccine with an adjuvant, an immune stimulant, to cause the immune system to have a higher response to the vaccine. </p>
      <p>“The data indicates that no matter what flu strain is out there, it provides more protection for older people,” Schaffner said.</p>
      <h3>What's the research behind these shots? Do they work?</h3>
      <p>Research indicates that high-dose flu vaccines, such as Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD, have improved a patient's protection against the flu. </p>
      <p>A peer-reviewed study published in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1315727">The New England Journal of Medicine</a> and sponsored by Sanofi, the company behind Fluzone High-Dose, found that the high-dose vaccine is about 24% more effective than the standard shot in preventing the flu.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1631218X?via%3Dihub">An observational study</a> in 2013 found that FLUAD is 51% effective in preventing flu-related hospitalizations for patients 65 and older.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Flu season: </b>
        <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/13/flu-season-not-severe-early-cdc-urges-caution-flu-shots/2582461001/">Early part of flu season 'not as scary' as feared, but CDC urges vaccinations</a>
      </p>
      <p>Kristin Englund, an infectious disease physician at the Cleveland Clinic, noted that some hospitals might carry only Fluzone High-Dose because there are more studies on it and it's been on the market longer than FLUAD. </p>
      <p>There are no studies that do a comparative analysis between the two vaccines. There also aren't any studies that test the high-dose vaccine on younger patients, which is why the FDA licensed the vaccines only for people 65 and older. </p>
      <p>Will these super-vaccines cost more money?</p>
      <p>Schaffner said that because both vaccines are more elaborate than the normal dose, they cost more to make. </p>
      <p>Both Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD are covered by those who qualify for Medicare with no out-of-pocket cost. </p>
      <h3>What flu shot to take?</h3>
      <p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the CDC does not recommend one vaccine over the other. </p>
      <p>Englund said the high-dose vaccines are preferable for patients 65 and older, but they should get the regular dose if a high-dose is unavailable. </p>
      <p>"If the option is to get the standard dose or nothing," Englund said. "We absolutely prefer the standard dose vaccine."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How effective is it?: </b>
        <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/grateful/2019/11/07/flu-shot-doctors-share-facts-reveal-if-you-should-get/2512608001/">Here's what doctors say about the flu shot</a>
      </p>
      <p>Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD, like many other vaccines, are egg-based. Patients with severe egg allergies shouldn't get the shot.</p>
      <p>It's not recommended for people who have a rare disorder called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793">Guillain-Barré syndrome</a>, in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves.</p>
      <p>Side effects for the high-dose vaccines mirror the standard dose: soreness around the injection site and a low, 24-hour fever. </p>
      <p>Schaffner said this shouldn’t deter patients as the alternative can be fatal.</p>
      <p>“A sore arm and one day of fever is a small price to pay to get prevention against influenza, which can be a very deadly infection,” he said.</p>
