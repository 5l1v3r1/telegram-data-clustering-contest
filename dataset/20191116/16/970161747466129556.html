      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/granit-xhaka/">Granit Xhaka</a> sent out a cryptic message from his Instagram following his return to action for Swizterland.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has not played for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> since his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/granit-xhaka-finally-breaks-silence-telling-arsenal-fans-fk-off-shocking-outburst-11021784/">explosive reaction to fans booing him at the Emirates</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Xhaka completed 90 minutes for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/switzerland-national-team/">Switzerland</a> against Georgia in their European qualifier and posted the following message in his native tongue after the game.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Happiness is when you are satisfied with yourself and do not need the confirmation of others.’</p>

      <p>Arsenal fans debated what the post could have meant on social media, with some reading the message as a potential dig at Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has faced intense criticism for his actions and was stripped of the captaincy by Emery.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland international has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/granit-xhaka-rubbishes-unai-emerys-claim-isnt-ready-play-arsenal-11073963/">defended himself since the armband was taken from him</a> and insisted he is ready to play for Arsenal again.</p>

      <p>Emery has refused to say if he will recall Xhaka and admitted there were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/unai-emery-reveals-discussions-arsenal-selling-granit-xhaka-january-11069988/">ongoing discussions about whether to sell him in January</a>.</p>
      <p>‘You can be sure that I’ll keep fighting and putting myself out there in every training session,’ Xhaka said in response to Emery’s most recent comments.</p>
      <p>‘I feel that last week has been dealt with and now I’m ready.’</p>
