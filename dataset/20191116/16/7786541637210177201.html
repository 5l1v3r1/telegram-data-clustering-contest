      <p><b>BENSALEM, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - A fiery interstate highway crash involving a tanker truck and an SUV in Pennsylvania has left three people injured.</p>
      <p>State police say the crash on I-95 in Bensalem happened just after 9 p.m. Friday and caused several lanes in both directions of the highway to be shut down.</p>
      <p>Authorities say the truck was carrying nearly 4,000 gallons of heating oil which quickly ignited, spreading flames from the highway overpass that set some nearby trees on fire.</p>
      <p>Firefighters battled the flames for about an hour before the blaze was extinguished.</p>
      <p>The names of the injured and details on their conditions were not disclosed.</p>
      <p>The cause of the crash remains under investigation.</p>
