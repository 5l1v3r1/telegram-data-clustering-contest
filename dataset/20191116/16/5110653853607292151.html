      <h1>Where is ‘College GameDay’ this week? Location, schedule, guest picker for Week 12 on ESPN</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Zac Al-Khateeb</a></address>
      <p>The site of one the <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/ranking-10-games-most-impact-college-football-playoff-field/15i5ojbk703z713vnbdll9qq3c">most important games</a> for the College Football Playoff will also play host to "College GameDay" on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That would be the Big 12 matchup between No. 10 Oklahoma and No. 12 Baylor in Waco, Texas. A loss for either team would eliminate them from Playoff contention, while a win would keep their postseason hopes alive another week.</p>
      <p>Baylor has a serious disadvantage in this series, claiming a 3-25-0 record against the Sooners. But, all of those wins have come since 2010, and the Bears played to a 49-41 loss the last time the Sooners visited Waco. This team's defense-first approach will have a tough time with Lincoln Riley's offense, headed by Jalen Hurts, but if they can make a few stops (and Charlie Brewer can string together some timely drives) Baylor might have a shot at pulling off the upset in Waco.</p>
      <p>With that, here's everything you need to know about "College GameDay" as it visits McLane Stadium in Waco, Texas.</p>

      <h3>Where is 'College GameDay' location for Week 12?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Location:</b> Waco, Texas</li>
        <li><b>Matchup:</b> No. 10 Oklahoma at No. 12 Baylor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will be the third time Waco hosts "GameDay," and the second time Oklahoma is the visiting team. The Bears won their first such game in 2014, beating visiting Kansas State 38-27. The Bears lost their next matchup in 2015 to Oklahoma, 44-34.</p>
      <h3>'College GameDay' schedule on ESPN</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>TV channel:</b> ESPN</li>
        <li><b>Start time:</b> 9 a.m. ET</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The "College GameDay" crew of Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis and Desmond Howard will preview Week 11's college football action live from Waco. The game will be broadcast on ABC with kickoff set for 7:30 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>ESPN typically announces its next "College GameDay" location every Monday. That almost certainly will be Columbus, Ohio, for the likely top-10 matchup between No. 9 Penn State and No. 2 Ohio State.</p>
