      <h1>Trump impeachment: White House budget official Mark Sandy to testify today</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:16:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>White House budget official Mark Sandy walked into a closed session of the US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/impeachment">impeachment </a>inquiry of President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>on Saturday, where he is expected to testify about the holdup of military aid to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Sandy, a career official of the Office of Management and Budget, would be the first person from OMB to testify before the inquiry after three political appointees defied congressional subpoenas to appear.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Sandy's lawyer said his client would appear for a deposition if he is issued a subpoena. It remained unclear on Saturday whether a subpoena was issued.</p>
      <p>Trump's pressure on Ukraine is at the heart of the Democratic-led inquiry into whether the Republican president misused US foreign policy to undermine one of his potential opponents in the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Trump launched a Twitter attack on a former US ambassador to Ukraine while she was testifying to an <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/impeachment">impeachment </a>hearing in Congress, in an extraordinary moment that Democrats said amounted to witness intimidation.</p>
      <p>Trump blasted Marie Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, as she explained to the second day of televised <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/impeachment">impeachment </a>hearings how she had fought corruption in Ukraine and how the Trump administration abruptly removed from her post earlier this year.</p>
