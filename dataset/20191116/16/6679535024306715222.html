      <p>India on November 16 conducted successfully the first night trial of Agni-II, its versatile surface-to-surface medium range nuclear-capable missile from Dr. Abdul Kalam Island off Odisha, defence sources said.</p>
      <p>The missile has a strike range of 2000 km, the sources said soon after it blasted off from a mobile launcher at the Launch Complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR), the sources said.</p>
      <p>Agni-II, an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), has already been inducted into the armed forces.</p>
      <p>A defence official said this was the first time that the sophisticated missile was test-fired at night.</p>
      <p>The entire trajectory of the trial was tracked by a battery of sophisticated radars, telemetry observation stations, electro-optic instruments and two naval ships located near the impact point in the down range area of Bay of Bengal, DRDO sources said.</p>
      <p>The 20-metre long two-stage ballistic missile has a launch weight of 17 tonnes and can carry a payload of 1000 kg over a distance of 2,000 km, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The two-stage missile equipped with advanced high accuracy navigation system, was guided by a novel state-of-the-art command and control system and propelled by solid rocket propellant system, the defence official said.</p>
      <p>The 2000 plus km range surface to surface missile has already been inducted and is part of countries arsenal for strategic deterrence. It was launched as a regular exercise undertaken by the armed forces, he said.</p>
      <p>The test on November 16 was carried out by the specially formed Strategic Forces Command (SFC) of the Army with logistic support from the Defence Research and Development Organisation.</p>
      <p>Agni-II was developed by Advanced Systems Laboratory along with other DRDO laboratories and integrated by the Bharat Dynamics Limited, Hyderabad, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Agni-II is part of the Agni series of missiles which includes 700-km range Agni-I, 3,000-km range Agni-III, Agni-IV and Agni-V.</p>
      <p>The first test-firing of the prototype of Agni-II missile was carried out on April 11, 1999. On May 17, 2010, the trial of nuclear-capable Agni-II ballistic missile was conducted by the Special Strategic Command Force from the ITR before it was made operational by the Army.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-test-fires-medium-range-nuclear-capable-agni-ii-missile/article22804407.ece">last trial was conducted</a> on February 20, 2018 from the same base.</p>
