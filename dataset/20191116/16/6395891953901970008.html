      <p><b>GEORGETOWN, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities have charged the husband of a malnourished 11-year-old girl's legal guardian.</p>
      <p>WXIX-TV reports 61-year-old Charles Breeze is in custody at a Cincinnati hospital. Breeze was indicted Thursday in Brown County on endangering children, felonious assault and kidnapping charges.</p>
      <p>Forty-seven-year-old Margaret Breeze was indicted on those charges last month.</p>
      <p>Authorities learned about the girl's mistreatment in September from a teacher administering an online test. The girl, who was homeschooled, said she was hungry and explained she was given just a small plate of rice each day.</p>
      <p>The girl weighed just 47 pounds (21.3 kilograms), roughly 30 pounds below the average weight for a girl her age.</p>
      <p>Authorities say she lived in deplorable conditions in a locked trailer monitored by a surveillance camera.</p>
      <p>It's unclear whether Charles Breeze has an attorney.</p>
