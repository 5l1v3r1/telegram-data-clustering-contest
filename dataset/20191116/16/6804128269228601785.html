      <h1>'Big lesson for us!' Gianfranco Zola makes Chelsea admission on what he and Sarri missed</h1>
      <h2>Gianfranco Zola has been speaking about the mistake he and Maurizio Sarri made</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Gianfranco Zola has provided his verdict on what has surprised him and made him proud about Chelsea this season.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> legend was at the club as an assistant last season under the guidance of Maurizio Sarri but the Italian's managerial stint ended early when he left for Juventus.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/gianfranco-zola">Zola</a> didn't join Sarri at Juventus and instead headed into unemployment and has been enjoying his time for rest following a busy managerial career so far.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea striker managed West Ham from 2008 to 2010 before he moved back to his homeland and took over a post coaching youth football at a national level.</p>
      <p>Stints at Watford, Cagliari, Al-Arabi and Birmingham City were next up but all ended without major success, before he briefly re-joined the Blues.</p>
      <p>But Chelsea will always be Zola's number one love in football and the club's fans are equally fond of the Italian.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when Zola offers his thoughts on the current crop of players under the tutelage of Frank Lampard, it's time to take note.</p>
      <p>Zola was on the Soccer AM sofa on Saturday morning and he provided a key revelation that he and Sarri made a mistake by not detecting the talent of <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/fikayo-tomori">Fikayo Tomori</a>, who is now a regular under Lampard and in the mix for England.</p>
      <p>"Chelsea have been amazing this season. There have been a few (players) that have been impressing me," Zola explained on Soccer AM.</p>
      <p>"(Fikayo) Tomori is one of the players. Last year we had him in the pre-season and we couldn't see all the qualities that he is showing now. That is a surprise and a big lesson for us and me personally as well. They are going beyond my expectations."</p>
      <p>Zola countered his surprise at the rise of Tomori by insisting that he always knew Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount were destined to shine one day at Chelsea.</p>

      <p>"Mason Mount is not surprising me because I saw the videos of him playing in Holland and Derby. He needed to adapt but there was always a big potential," Zola added.</p>
      <p>"I'm not surprised about Tammy (Abraham). When we had him he was a raw talent but I loved the attitude and positivity. They have all got a great attitude."</p>
