        <b>A man has been jailed for five years for three charges of sexual assault on a young girl.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adam Hudson, 35, of Pondfield Road, Colchester, appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court where he received five years for one count of assaulting a girl under 13 by touching Monday, November 11.</p>
      <p>Hudson also received further two further year long sentences which will run concurrently with the five year sentence for two further counts of assault on a girl aged under 13.</p>
      <p>He was placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and was made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).</p>
      <p>The victim spoke of her ordeal with another adult following a lesson at school before police were called in to investigate.</p>
      <p>Hudson's sentencing follows a long investigation by Essex Police's Child Abuse Investigation Team into offences between September 2011 and September 2018.</p>
      <p>Investigating officer DC Kimberly Farrow said: "Hudson subjected a young girl to horrific sexual offences over a number of years.</p>
      <p>"The girl bravely spoke to another adult in confidence after realising she had been a victim of crime and she then courageously spoke to our officers.</p>
      <p>"Hudson is a sex offender and this week he has been sent to prison for these serious offences.</p>
      <p>"He has been placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and will have to abide to conditions within a SHPO once he is released."</p>
