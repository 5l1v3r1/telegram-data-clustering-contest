      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 16 — Datuk Seri Wee Jeck Seng’s win in the Tanjung Piai by-election will be a starting point for Johor Barisan Nasional (BN) to uphold its principle of unity among its component parties, its Johor chief Datuk Hasni Mohammad tonight.</p>
      <p>He said the win by BN, through MCA’s candidate, was a significant victory for the coalition in the state.</p>
      <p>“Yes, I believe the win will be an encouragement for [Johor BN] in facing the upcoming 15th general election.</p>
      <p>“We will uphold this concept,” said Hasni at the sidelines of the official result announcement by the Election Commission (EC) at the Dewan Jubli Intan Sultan Ibrahim here tonight.</p>
      <p>He was commenting on BN’s landslide victory over Pakatan Harapan (PH) in the Tanjung Piai by-election today, with a whopping majority of 15,086 votes.</p>
      <p>Hasni was instrumental in BN’s successful Tanjung Piai by-election campaign for the past month.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old veteran politician is known as a respected figure in Johor politics where he is also both admired and feared by his adversaries.</p>
      <p>Hasni, who is also the Johor Umno liaison chief and also the state Opposition leader, said that the election results was a message for the government of the day to take note of the rakyat’s interest.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, we as the Opposition we will represent the ‘rakyat’ and also those who are downtrodden.</p>
      <p>“As a responsible Opposition front, we will not forsake the ‘rakyat’ and continue to champion them,” said Hasni, who is also the Benut assemblyman.</p>
