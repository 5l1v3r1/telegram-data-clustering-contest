      <h3>Solutions for your android phone or tablet that Won’t turn on</h3>
      <h4>Solution 1: When Was The Last Time You Charged Your Phone?</h4>
      <p>Sometimes we think that our phone had enough battery to last for the day but we did not realize that one of the applications ended up using quite a bit of battery and the phone died unexpectedly. We saw many users asking “My Samsung Galaxy or Android device won’t turn on, what can I do?”. The first thing you should do is to let the phone <b>charge for 20-30 minutes</b>, and then try to turn it on. If your phone powers on, you know the battery had been used up so the problem is fixed unless this happens too frequently in which case you must look for solutions for <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/android-phone-wont-charge/">Samsung Galaxy or android phone battery won’t hold the charge</a>. If your phone does not charge when you connect it to the charger then try the next step.</p>

      <h4>Solution 2: Use a Different Charging Method</h4>
      <p>If your phone’s or tablet’s charger is not helping, then try using a USB cable and connect your device to your <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/best-computers-for-photo-editing/">computer</a>. If you were using a computer to charge the phone then switch to a wall charger to check if it works. If nothing happens, try charging another device if possible, using the same charger to check if other devices are charging. By doing this, you will figure out if the problem lies within the device or the charger.</p>
      <p>Make sure that the charger or the cable is not damaged in any way if you do not have a different device to test whether the charger is working or not. Damaged cables can be a reason why your phone is unable to charge and if your phone’s battery is dead then your phone will not switch on.</p>

      <h4>Solution 3: Switch batteries</h4>
      <p>This is not the most viable solution for everyone, especially the owners of Samsung devices that came with non-removable batteries. On the other hand, if you are using a tablet or an Android device with a removable battery and have an extra battery with you, check if the phone powers on when you switch batteries.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Solution 4: Try Hitting the Power Button – Again</h4>
      <p>I know you have already tried using the Power button but try it more than two or three times. After you charge the phone, Press the Power button a few times to ensure that there is definitely a problem in powering on the phone. If it Powers on then check if the Power button is working properly. There may be a problem in the way the Power button is wired up and maybe some loose component is causing the issue. Take the phone to a technician who can check the internal wiring of the phone if the Power button is not working properly.</p>

      <h4>Solution 5: Reinsert the Battery</h4>
      <p>You can try this solution only if you have a device with a removable battery. Since your Android device is powered off, remove the battery, then press and hold the Power button for a few seconds so that all the power is drained from within the circuits of the phone. Now reinsert the battery and try to Power on your phone. If the phone switches on then this could have been a one-time issue with the phone which stands resolved. If this doesn’t work, proceed to the next step.</p>

      <h4>Solution 6: Reboot in Safe Mode</h4>
      <p>Sometimes, the problem in your phone arises because of a third party app which may be corrupted. This can be checked by trying to boot your phone into Safe Mode where the third party apps will not run. Only the pre-loaded apps will run on the phone when it is in Safe Mode. This will help you narrow down the problem. If your phone works in Safe Mode, you know that the problem lies in one of the third party apps. Let us first look at the steps that will help you reboot your phone into Safe Mode.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to power on your phone by pressing and holding the power key and the volume down key</li>
        <li>Once you see the Samsung screen, you can release the Power key but continue to hold the volume down key till the home screen appears and you can see Safe Mode written on the lower left corner of the phone screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are able to boot your phone up in Safe mode, then you have a problem with one of the third party apps that are installed on your phone. To solve this problem you can either reset your phone to factory settings or you can uninstall third party apps and try restarting your phone in normal mode.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>To leave<a href="https://www.technobezz.com/boot-samsung-galaxy-s7-safe-mode/"> Safe mode</a> and go back to normal mode, you just need to restart the phone the usual way – By bringing up the Power options by pressing and holding the Power button and choosing Restart.</p>
      <p>If you had no success in trying to boot your phone in Safe mode then try the next step.</p>
      <h4>Solution 7: Wipe Cache Partition</h4>
      <p>Wiping the cache partition of your phone allows you to remove the cache files which may have been corrupted and caused the phone to power off. There is a possibility that the corrupt cache files may not allow your phone to power On. These cache files are temporary in nature and will be created by the phone once again after you wipe out the current cache files. To wipe the cache partition, follow these steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press and hold the Power button, the Volume Down button, and the Home button all at the same time.</li>
        <li>Once you see the Android icon, release the Power button but continue to press and hold the other two buttons till you see the System Recover screen.</li>
        <li>You will see a menu with many options. Use the Volume Down key to highlight the option that says ‘Wipe Cache Partition’.</li>
        <li>Select the option by using the Power key and the process of wiping out the cache partition will initiate.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.technobezz.com/files/uploads/2016/07/Sol-7-www.youtube.com_.jpg"/>

          <cite>www.youtube.com</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Once it completes, your phone will automatically reboot and new cache files will be built by your phone. If you are able to go through the entire process successfully and your phone switches on, then your problem is fixed, but if your Samsung Galaxy won’t turn on or charge even after wiping the cache partition then you must consider resetting the phone to factory settings.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Solution 8: Reset the Phone to Factory Settings</h4>
      <p>If you have not been able to get any success with any of the solutions above, then try resetting your Android device or the tablet whatever you are using to its initial settings because it will help your phone get rid of all files that may be causing the problem. <a href="https://www.technobezz.com/factory-reset-samsung-galaxy-s7-s7-edge/">Factory reset </a>wipes all data on the phone, so you will end up losing data and the apps that you may have installed on the phone permanently. If you do not wish to lose any data on your phone then it is advisable to take your phone to a technician who can check alternative ways to fix your phone.</p>
      <p>Depending on the model, there may be different options, but the most common way to reset a device is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press and Hold the Volume Down, Home, and Power button.</li>
        <li>Once you see the Android icon, release the Power button and continue to press and hold the other two buttons till you see the Recovery Mode screen.</li>
        <li>Once you get the menu on the Recovery Mode, highlight the option “Factory Reset” by using the volume down key.</li>
        <li>Select the option using the Power key and let the process of factory reset to complete after which your phone will restart on its own.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once the phone restarts you can begin using it and you will get a fresh start, but all data will be lost.</p>

      <h3>What can I do if my Samsung Galaxy won’t start after water damage?</h3>
      <p>While some of the Samsung flagships are waterproof, considerable water damage can cause this problem. If any of your Samsung Galaxy phones was accidentally damaged in water, do not try to turn the phone on or charge it immediately. Allow all parts of the phone to dry completely before you consider using the phone.</p>
      <p>When Samsung Galaxy S3 was introduced as a waterproof phone, some owners complained that their Samsung Galaxy won’t charge after water damage. While the phone is water resistant, there are a lot of things that can still cause the damage. Make sure you try these steps, not only for the S3 but for any Samsung Galaxy phone if it gets wet.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow the phone to dry for 24 hours by removing the battery (if it is removable) and the back cover and putting all the parts of the phone in a bag of rice.</li>
        <li>For those who have a few bags of silica gel available, it also helps in drying the phone quickly.</li>
        <li>Once it is dried, clean the charging port and connect the charger, allow the phone to charge and then switch it on.</li>
      </ul>
