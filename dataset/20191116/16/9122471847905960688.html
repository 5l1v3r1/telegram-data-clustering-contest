      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Doesn’t Think Michigan-Michigan State Will Be Close</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:27:57+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Michigan-Michigan State rivalry has provided the college football world with some pretty crazy games over the years. Will we get another one today?</p>
      <p>Kirk Herbstreit doesn’t think so. The ESPN college football analyst has unveiled his prediction for this afternoon’s rivalry game in Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>The <i>College GameDay </i>analyst likes Michigan – big.</p>
      <p>“Michigan kills Michigan State today,” he said this morning.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index projections seem to agree with Herbstreit, too. The computer model doesn’t think Michigan State has much of a chance.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s Football Power Index is giving Michigan an 84.2 percent chance of winning today’s game. It gives Michigan State just a 15.8 percent chance of pulling off the upset.</h3>
      <p>Few head coaches need a win today more than Mark Dantonio, though it doesn’t look like anyone is expecting him to get one.</p>
      <p>Michigan and Michigan State are set to kick off at noon E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
