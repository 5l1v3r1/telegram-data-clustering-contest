      <h1>Iowa Will Be Wearing A Special Helmet For Its Showdown With Minnesota</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:31:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>The Iowa Hawkeyes have a huge game on Saturday afternoon against the Minnesota Golden Gophers. It looks like the team will be wearing a special helmet for the contest.</p>
      <p>Iowa will be hosting a blackout for the game, which could help decide the Big Ten West. The Hawkeyes will also be wearing a black helmet with a red, white and blue hawkeye logo. It features stars and stripes like the American flag.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Iowa has worn the helmet. But there’s no doubt that it’s one of their better looks. Hopefully fans agree.</p>
      <p>Iowa announced the news on social media.</p>

      <p>Minnesota, surprisingly, is off to a 9-0 start to the season after a huge upset win over Penn State last week. The Golden Gophers are ranked No. 8 in the College Football Playoff rankings as a result.</p>
      <p>Iowa, meanwhile, is in the midst of a 6-3 season that includes a 3-3 mark in the Big Ten. The Hawkeyes are probably out of the Big Ten West race, but they can still achieve a nine or 10-win season if they win out.</p>
      <p>The Hawkeyes and the Golden Gophers kick off at 4:00 PM ET on FOX.</p>
