      <h1>Mason Rudolph Makes Decision On Whether He’ll Take Legal Action Against Myles Garrett</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:12:25+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett is facing an indefinite suspension from the NFL for his actions at the end of Thursday night’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. But he won’t be facing any legal action.</p>
      <p>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported Friday night that Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph will not be taking legal action against Garrett. He says Rudolph considers the situation to be an “NFL matter.”</p>
      <p>Garrett, after a tussle with Rudolph on the ground, tore the quarterback’s helmet off and slammed him in the head with it. It was one of the most egregious things we’ve seen in NFL history.</p>
      <p>Rudolph was fined for the incident, but he was not suspended. Two other players were – Pittsburgh’s Maurkice Pouncey (three games) and Cleveland’s Larry Ogunjobi (one game).</p>

      <p>Garrett is suspended for at least the rest of the regular season and the playoffs if the Browns qualify. He’ll have to meet with commissioner Roger Goodell before he’s reinstated into the league.</p>
