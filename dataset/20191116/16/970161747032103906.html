      <p>A wheelchair-using mother feels discriminated against after a bus driver refused to let her board when her 17-year-old son’s payment card wouldn’t scan properly.</p>
      <p>Martine Hartley, 42, from Toxteth, Liverpool, said she was forced to leave the 86 Stagecoach bus in the rain.</p>
      <p>She was left feeling ‘disgusted’ when the driver would not let her use her own card to pay for her son, who has autism.</p>
      <p>Martine added: ‘Rather than let me get my card out to pay instead, the bus driver demanded that we all get off the bus immediately. ]</p>
      <p>‘I can’t walk and am in a wheelchair. My son has autism so I’m his carer. To be treated like this is disgusting.</p>

      <p>‘The driver watched my son wheel me off the bus and into the pouring rain. She just watched us get off the bus that we should have been allowed on.’</p>
      <p>The bus company’s website states vulnerable people at risk or in distress who are unable to pay should be carried and the customer should present another form of payment if their card is declined.</p>
      <p>Martine, who was also travelling with her niece, got in touch with Stagecoach but is still waiting for a response.</p>
      <p>The company say they deny all wrongdoing and have investigated the incident.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: ‘We have carried out a full investigation into this alleged incident, including reviewing the CCTV and speaking to the supervisor involved and our investigation does not support some of the claims that have been made.</p>
      <p>‘The CCTV shows that one of the passengers trying to travel on the bus does not have either a valid ticket or appear to have the means to pay for a ticket for his journey.</p>
      <p>‘The passenger then informed the driver that he had decided to leave the vehicle.</p>
      <p>‘We’re sorry to hear that the passengers are unhappy with their experience with us and we would be more than happy to discuss their concerns and in more detail with them.’</p>
