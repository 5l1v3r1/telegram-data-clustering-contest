      <p>"His nose was in bits, but we decided not to have it operated and let nature take its course. We had the same trouble with Briar Hill, but operating on him didn't work.</p>
      <p>"His run in the Fishery Lane (behind Espoir D'Allen) showed us he could be Grade One material.</p>
      <p>"He quickened up well at the last and won like a nice horse. Hopefully they will all improve.</p>
      <p>"Klassical Dream threw himself at the first hurdle and then he was just too keen. I think he'll improve from that, and a stronger gallop will help them all too.</p>
      <p>"Patrick (Mullins) was never happy on Sharjah. I'd imagine he wanted the run badly and he'd want better ground.</p>
      <p>"It has been a lucky race for us, not always with the first string, but they are all there doing their best and that's what happens."</p>
