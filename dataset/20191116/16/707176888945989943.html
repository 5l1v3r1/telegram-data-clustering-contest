      <h1>Sharp rise in petrol price sparks protests across Iran</h1>
      <h2>Thousands take to streets after fuel subsidies cut by 50% to cope with tough US sanctions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:17:17+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author">Najmeh Bozorgmehr</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of people across Iran took to the streets on Saturday to protest against a sharp rise in petrol prices, with security forces using tear gas, batons and firing live rounds into the air to disperse the biggest demonstrations in the country since December 2017.</p>
      <p>The Iranian government increased the cost of petrol by 50 per cent at midnight on Thursday, as it tries to cope with a sharp fall in income due to crippling US sanctions. Motorists are now entitled to buy 60 litres of petrol a month at IR15,000 ($0.36) a litre since Friday. Extra fuel is still available but at a cost of IR30,000 a litre.</p>
      <p>The economy is under severe distress, with gross domestic product forecast to contract by 9 per cent this year, according to the IMF. The increase in fuel prices was intended to generate more income for the government to buy basic commodities and medicine, and to pay civil servants, workers and pensioners. But Iranians fear the decision could put them under more pressure, with inflation above 40 per cent.</p>
      <p>In Tehran, people stopped their cars on main roads and chanted anti-regime slogans, and at least one person has died in the southern town of Sirjan, according to officials.</p>
      <p>A journalist in the southern city of Shiraz said at least two petrol stations were set on fire, and a resident of the port of Bushehr said there were “chaotic” scenes after protesters blocked some of the main crossroads.</p>
      <p>The increase in costs came after Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, Iran’s oil minister, had earlier denied there would be any change in policy.</p>
      <p>“They lied to us in a nasty game,” said one Tehran resident. A restaurant worker said there could be no retreat unless the government reversed its decision. “We will set this city on fire if they do not change their decision,” the person said.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, Iran’s prosecutor-general, warned on Saturday that any disruption of public order, such as stopping cars in the streets or attacks on state properties, was a crime and would be treated seriously.</p>
      <p>But Mojtaba Zonnour, a leading hardline member of the parliament, has suggested the legislature should intervene immediately to reverse the rise in petrol prices, calling the increase illegal because the government did not seek permission from parliament.</p>
      <p>Most public attacks have been directed at Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s centrist president, whose reputation has been hit by the unravelling of the 2015 nuclear accord — his signature achievement. Donald Trump, US president, pulled Washington out of the agreement in May last year and has imposed the toughest sanctions yet on Iran.</p>
      <p>Mr Rouhani has focused his public speeches in recent weeks on the need for talks with the Islamic republic’s enemies, widely understood to be a reference to the US. But he has faced resistance from hardliners who do not want to make any compromise on Iran’s regional and defence policies.</p>
      <p>Despite the hardships, Mr Rouhani’s government had been credited with stabilising the economy before the fuel price increase. “It was a few months that I was feeling some stability until the petrol decision was announced and [that] made me so anxious again about the future,” said one Tehran housewife.</p>
