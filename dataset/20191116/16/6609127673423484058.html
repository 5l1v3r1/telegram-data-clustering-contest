      <p>In the pic Sam can be seen modelling the design in a scarf - while another pic declares the "thread counts incorporate Sam Heughan's date of birth - like a vintage dram it is important to know where, when and hot it was made".</p>
      <p>Sam wrote: "With the release of the wonderful The Secret Life of Tartan by Vixy Rae (available now!) - we are also announcing the launch of the official Sassenach Tartan!!</p>
      <p>"A unique new tartan, designed and crafted in collaboration with the brilliant Prickly Thistle Scotland."</p>
      <p>And it looks like fans aren't the only ones who can't get enough of the new design, with fellow castmate Duncan Lacroix putting in an early order.</p>
