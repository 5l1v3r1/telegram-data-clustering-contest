      <p>A man facing death row has won reprieve and a variety of celebrities are celebrating</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> pressure from celebrities like Meek Mill, Beyonce, and Kim Kardashian have helped spare the life of a death row inmate.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/meek-mill-advocates-for-stopping-the-execution-of-rodney-reed-G-0VXcUtxk6IkfODK14m8w/">Rodney Reed was originally scheduled to be executed on November 20th.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Rodney is currently on death row in Livingston, Texas for murdering Stacey Stites in 1996, where cops said he raped, assaulted and strangled her to death. Reed has maintained his innocence of killing her for over two decades now.</p>
      <p>But a panel of experts, as well as dozens of celebrities believed there was concrete evidence to prove he is innocent for the murder he was accused of committing more than two decades ago.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for both, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued a stay of execution and recommended a 120-day reprieve.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Kim flew to Texas with her husband Kanye West for his forthcoming performance at Joel Osteen’s church.</p>
      <p>Authorities granted her special permission to meet with Rodney Reed face to face.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the Innocence Project, which represented Rodney Reed, set the reprieve would give them more time to make their case for his innocence.</p>
      <p>"This opportunity will allow for proper consideration of the powerful and mounting new evidence of Mr. Reed’s innocence," the organization said in a press release. </p>
