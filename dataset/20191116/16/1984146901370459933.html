        <figcaption>The stats that have defined Sunderland's season so far</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Phil Parkinson wants to strengthen his Sunderland squad in the January transfer market - with his initial assessment of the squad he inherited from Jack Ross being that is lacks balance in certain areas of the pitch.</p>
      <p>Chairman <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/stewart-donald">Stewart Donald</a> has vowed the back <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">the new manager</a> to add his own stamp to the squad when the window opens, with new investment in the form of a loan to holding company Madrox from FPP likely to help.</p>
      <p>But what positions do <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> need to strengthen in? In order of priority, here's what we think.</p>
      <h3>Winger</h3>
      <p>Sunderland are desperately short on the wings, and that has been highlighted in recent weeks, with George Dobson playing there in the second half at Oxford.</p>
      <p>Lynden Gooch's injury has exposed how short on wingers Sunderland are, with Ross not prioritising the position in the summer because until very late in the window he set the side up to not play with them.</p>
      <p>But Parkinson's system needs good wingers, and what Sunderland's attack really lacks is someone with both pace and athleticism. A tall winger who will run at defenders and get in behind, but also get in good positions in the box to support the attack when balls are coming in the box from the other flank.</p>
      <p>Far too often since Parkinson's arrival, crosses have been delivered over the head of the striker, only to have no one attacking the back post from the wing.</p>
      <h3>Right-back</h3>
      <p>Conor McLaughlin came in on a free in the summer from Millwall and while he's more recently looked more comfortable since Parkinson's arrival, his form is still shaky and he can often be guilty of losing his concentration and allowing men to drift off his shoulder and in behind.</p>
      <p>Luke O'Nien is the only other senior player capable of playing right-back, having spent most of the season there last term.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But the ex-Wycombe man has been doing well at number ten recently and was sent off in the EFL Trophy game at Scunthorpe when forced to go back into defence with McLaughlin away on international duty. O'Nien had a difficult night against the pacy Abo Eisa.</p>
      <p>Adding extra cover at right-back would provide competition for McLaughlin, and free up O'Nien to play his more natural role further forward.</p>
      <h3>Striker</h3>
      <p>Sunderland's three strikers have not found their feet at all this term and the Black Cats have struggled for goals.</p>
      <p>Charlie Wyke looked desperately low in confidence before getting injured, Will Grigg just cannot get going despite early encouraging displays under the new manager, while injuries hampered a positive start from Marc McNulty, who hasn't been fancied by Parkinson.</p>

      <p>Strikers don't come cheap in January, as Stewart Donald found with Grigg. So if Parkinson wants a new one - highly likely - he may well need to offload one first. It's something you think he'd be willing to do if he knows he has someone lined up to come in.</p>
      <h3>Another forward</h3>
      <p>With Parkinson favouring a 4-2-3-1 formation, those three players in behind the central striker are key to his plans for high, attacking intent.</p>
      <p>With injuries leaving them short of options, Parkinson hasn't had much competition with which to mix things up with, and has had to persist with the likes of Chris Maguire and Aiden McGeady despite their hit and miss form this term.</p>
      <p>We've already discussed the need for one winger, while a new right-back could free O'Nien up to play at number ten two, but whether it's a second winger or a number ten, there's a case to be made for Sunderland needing two forwards in January.</p>
      <p>The added competition might help raise the games of the current players there too.</p>
      <h3>Left-back</h3>
      <p>Denver Hume has gone from strength to strength since Parkinson's arrival, but at 21, still has plenty to work on.</p>
      <p>Laurens De Bock, meanwhile, has failed to impress since arriving on loan from Leeds United. He could still yet change perceptions and stay the season, but there will also be the option to send him back and look elsewhere for a left-back.</p>
      <p>It was a position Sunderland struggled to fill in the summer, with De Bock very low down their initial list of targets as one by one, many fell through.</p>
      <p>If De Bock's form doesn't pick up, then Parkinson might find himself scouring that left-back market again. The Belgian does have Champions League experience though, and is still building his fitness, so could yet come good.</p>
      <h3>Centre-back</h3>
      <p>Jordan Willis and Joel Lynch have formed an ever-growing partnership since Lynch's arrival at the club, with Alim Ozturk and Tom Flanagan unable to displace them, save for cup games.</p>
      <p>There's good reason for that too, with neither proving completely reliable since arriving at the club last summer.</p>
      <p>Both have just six months left on their deals and, with Parkinson likely to have someone in mind, one, perhaps both, could be cut to make way for a new arrival.</p>
      <p>Sunderland have had just three clean sheets all term - two of which have come in Parkinson's eight games in charge.</p>
      <h3>Centre-midfield</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Not a huge priority, but one Parkinson still might explore if the right player comes up, and Dylan McGeouch leaves the club six months early.</p>
      <p>McGeouch just hasn't settled at Sunderland. He made the choice after a difficult first season to stay and fight for his place, but this term has been much like the last.</p>
      <p>With six months left on his deal a move back to Scotland would make sense, allowing Parkinson an opportunity to bring in a central midfielder more athletic like Max Power and George Dobson, who he's preferred.</p>
      <p>Of course, if a right-back is signed then O'Nien could be the answer to that problem, or Ethan Robson, on loan at Grimsby Town until January for now, could also be an option.</p>
