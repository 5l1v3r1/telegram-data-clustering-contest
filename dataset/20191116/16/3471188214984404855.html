      <p>The two deals are separate but there’s nothing stopping you signing up for both if you want to.</p>
      <p>You can cancel either or both the subscriptions a few seconds after signing up for the 3 and 4 months periods and you’ll still have access for the full period you signed up for.</p>
      <h3>Kindle Unlimited – 3 Months Free</h3>
      <p>Amazon says Kindle Unlimited gives you the freedom to explore over one million titles and thousands of audiobooks on any device.</p>
      <p>The usual price for 3 months is $41.97, <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku">the deal price is $0</a>. When the deal is over you’ll be charged from then on at $13.99/month if you want to continue. This promotional offer is valid for signups until 8 December 2019.</p>
      <h3>Music Unlimited – 4 Months for 99c</h3>
      <p>Music Unlimited is Amazon’s version of premium ad free music as a subscription service</p>
      <p>The usual price for 4 months is $47.96 but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/music/unlimited?ref_=dmm_acq_marin_p_bra%7Cc_331701757817_m_W3mcjSSu-dm_s__">deal price is 99c</a>. After 4 months of you don’t cancel you’ll pay $11.99/month.</p>
      <p>The terms and conditions say new customers only but it worked for me even though I’ve used a free trial before.</p>
      <p>Music Unlimited features an advertised 50 million tracks as well as thousands of expert-programmed playlists and stations.</p>
      <p>With Amazon Music Unlimited, you can listen on all your devices: smartphone, tablet, PC/Mac, Alexa-enabled speakers or Chromecast speakers. Of course like other streaming music services you can also download music for offline listening.</p>
