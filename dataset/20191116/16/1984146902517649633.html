      <h1>Is this a hint that the Tyne Bridge will feature in the Tesco Christmas advert?</h1>
      <h2>If you look closely, you can see the big tribute to Newcastle in the advert which takes a trip down memory lane</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:33:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Collings</a></address>
      <p>Can you spot it?</p>
      <p>If you look closely enough, this may be a big hint that the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-bridge">Tyne Bridge</a> will feature in Tesco's upcoming Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>The tribute to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> can be seen in a clip of the nostalgic ad which takes a trip down memory lane.</p>
      <p>The Tesco <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> campaign delivers a magic journey through time to celebrate 100th year.</p>

      <p>The advert is to launch on Sunday on ITV ahead of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> and will show how the nation has celebrated the festive season with the retail giant for the last 100 years.</p>
      <p>It shows a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tesco">Tesco</a> delivery driver who is surprised when he disappears and pops up in the future. He passes some of London’s iconic sights.</p>
      <p>There is also a special delivery made to Winston Churchill at No.10 and something for ‘the Palace’.</p>
      <p>The driver and his van then pay a visit to the classic 1980s game show, Bullseye, as well as popping into parties and raves throughout the century.</p>
      <p>And it appears that at some point, the driver must pay a visit to the toon as a glimpse of our iconic bridge can be spotted in the distance.</p>
      <p>It is understood that one of the writers from the company that produced the advert is from Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Alessandra Bellini, Tesco chief customer officer, said: “2019 marks 100 years of Tesco helping families up and down the country celebrate Christmas.  With the help of a delivery van, a cast from across the decades and little bit of magic, we’re telling that story.”</p>
