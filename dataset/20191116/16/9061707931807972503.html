      <h2>Derby County latest - The Rams have endured a stuttering start to their Sky Bet Championship campaign, going into the international break sitting in the bottom half.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:55:16+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Kemble</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> full-back Shane Nicholson believes his old club are 'making progress'.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">The Rams</a> have made a slow start to the season and indeed to life under <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/phillip-cocu">Phillip Cocu</a>, sitting 16th in the Championship table.</p>
      <p>But they are still within seven points of the play-offs, as well as heading in the right direction, according to Nicholson.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/2019/11/nicholson-im-encouraged-by-derbys-attacking-play">Speaking on RamsTV</a>, the former defender who made 74 league appearances said: "Looking at the last three games we have managed something like 19 shots on target.</p>
      <p>“For me, that shows that we are making progress. <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-promotion-odds-forest-3415135">Against Forest last weekend</a> we had 11 shots and seven of them were on target as well, which tells you the team is creating chances.</p>

      <p>“If one of those goes in then it really does take the pressure off. The big thing is the side is creating opportunities. We’re hitting the target, but we know it’s about sticking the ball into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>“When you’re creating chances and you’re not taking them, as the game goes on it does add that bit of pressure to the goalkeeper and back four. It’s natural in a game for that to happen.”</p>

      <p>Nicholson went on to speak about how he has taken inspiration from recent outings.</p>
      <p>“In the last three games I have seen an identity in the team and how they want to play,” the 49-year-old added.</p>
      <p>“The evidence is there in the performances, so we are moving in the right direction. I am sure the manager has learnt a lot about the division and his squad in these opening months.</p>
      <p>“Obviously we just need to cut out these little errors that we are making in games. Don’t get me wrong, we all make mistakes, but they are just proving to be costly for us right now.”</p>
