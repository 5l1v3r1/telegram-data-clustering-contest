      <h2>SBI Life Insurance surges 68% in 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:07:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Ashish-Rukhaiyar-365/" target="_blank">Ashish Rukhaiyar</a></address>
      <p>A strong growth in new business, strong distribution franchise and a sustained shift towards high-margin segments have made listed insurance companies the green shoots in the otherwise battered financials space, where banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are witnessing extreme volatility with a downward bias.</p>
      <p>In the current calendar year, while the Sensex has risen nearly 12%, stocks of most listed insurance companies have outperformed the benchmark by a wide margin and have surged between 50% and 70% .</p>

      <p>SBI Life Insurance has been the best performer with its shares gaining 68% in 2019 till date. The stock surged from ₹596.45 in December 2018 to the current market price of ₹1,002.10.</p>
      <p>ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has also gained more than 60% in 2019.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley, in a report released on Thursday, said that stocks of insurance players have re-rated sharply due to strong new business growth and continued diversification of earnings towards protection and annuity products. “Insurers’ increased focus on traditional non-par savings products (annuities/guaranteed savings) along with protection has helped drive strong value-of-new-business (VNB) growth even as ULIP (unit linked insurance plan) premium growth moderated,” it said.</p>
      <p>“We believe the mix shift towards higher-margin segments is in early stages and will continue to drive strong VNB growth over the medium term, even as lower interest rates moderate the pace of sales of annuities/guaranteed interest rate products,” it added.</p>
      <p>The global financial major believes that life insurance players have “strong distribution franchises, good cost and persistency metrics, and are well placed to gain market share.”</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley, however, added that the recent surge in stock prices has stretched the valuations “above mean levels” that could imply “limited upside” in the near term.</p>
      <p>General Insurance Corporation of India has been a laggard among listed insurance firms in 2019, though it touched its 52-week high of ₹333.85 on October 31.</p>
