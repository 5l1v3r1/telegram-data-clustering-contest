        <b>WASHINGTON (AP) —Impeachment investigators in the United States House or Representatives are now hearing from a White House budget official in closed-door testimony at the Capitol.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lawmakers convened to interview Mark Sandy.</p>
      <p>He is the first official from the Office of Management and Budget to defy President Donald Trump’s instructions not to testify.</p>
      <p>Like other witnesses in the investigation, Sandy was expected to receive a congressional subpoena to appear.</p>
      <p>Investigators are eager to hear from Sandy as they scrutinise the administration’s decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The hold-up of that assistance came as Trump asked Ukraine’s new president to investigate Democrats and Trump political rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>That request is central to the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Trump insists that he did nothing wrong.</p>
