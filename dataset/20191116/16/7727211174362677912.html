      <h1>David Unsworth's opportunity to banish bizarre Joey Barton rant as Everton prepare for Fleetwood clash</h1>
      <h2>David Unsworth was the subject of a bizarre Joey Barton rant when he was caretaker Everton manager in 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:26:48+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/adam-jones/" target="_blank">Adam Jones</a></address>
      <p>Two years ago, David Unsworth was feeling the pressure of the Everton senior job for the second time.</p>
      <p>Having taken caretaker charge, alongside Blues legend Joe Royle, at the end of the 2015/16 term for one match after the sacking of Roberto Martinez - the opportunity came again after Ronald Koeman departed Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Having led <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> U23s to the Premier League 2 title the season before, the former defender took charge of five senior league matches across October and November 2017 - winning two of them.</p>
      <p>However, Unsworth still came in for some criticism over that time, most notably from Joey Barton in a bizarre rant.</p>
      <p>"He’s a glorified PE teacher. He’s an academy coach who shouldn’t be managing a men’s team," the former midfielder said.</p>
      <p>"I watched him waddling on to the coach. How can you get players to exert themselves physically when you’re out of shape? </p>
      <p>"I used to watch him as an Evertonian and he was the most immobile left-back I’ve ever seen. He’s not a manager and doesn’t look like one."</p>
      <p>Barton is now the manager of Fleetwood Town, and will <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-u21s-find-out-next-17268279">bring his team to Merseyside to meet Everton U21s</a> in round two of the EFL Trophy next month.</p>
      <p>That match should provide <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/david-unsworth">Unsworth</a> a chance to put those strange comments behind him.</p>
      <p>Of course, the manager of the young Blues wasn't affected by Barton's words at the time, and was only focusing on the form of the team.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’m not bothered about comments about myself. I’m hurting because we are not winning games and that is really important to me.</p>
      <p>"I’m hurting when I see thousands of fans travel to Lyon and to Chelsea and Leicester and we don’t get the result for them. That’s what hurts me.</p>
      <p>"Any personal insult, be it funny or really personal, does not interest me."</p>
      <p>Unsworth didn't get the job on a permanent basis two years ago, eventually stepping back to the U23s after a thumping 4-0 victory over West Ham at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>But in the time that has passed since then, there have been a number of impressive accolades for the youth coach.</p>
      <p>Last season saw Unsworth build not just a strong side, but another successful side. They even became double-winners thanks to a Premier League Cup triumph alongside lifting the league title.</p>
      <p>Because of that, this term has seen some of the most promising members of that team either called up to work with the Blues first team or sent out on loan.</p>
      <p>The likes of Nathan Broadhead and Fraser Hornby have clearly benefited from the teachings of Unsworth before leaving temporarily and thriving in their new first team environments.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, back on Merseyside, the likes of Anthony Gordon, Lewis Gibson and Dennis Adeniran (among others) can regularly be found training with the first team.</p>
      <p>The former, in fact, was on the bench for Everton's most recent match against Southampton as his progression takes another upward curve.</p>
      <p>Unsworth has been tasked with rebuilding a lot of the U23s this term and has started the campaign well considering the circumstances - reaching this stage of the EFL Trophy for the first time.</p>
      <p>And, with it, giving himself the perfect chance to banish those Barton comments.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, Fleetwood are a League One side and will be bringing their first team to face the young Blues - they could potentially have Wembley in their sights at the end of this competition.</p>
      <p>Lose to a side such as that, and Unsworth will exit the competition with no regrets having led his side to this stage at all.</p>
      <p>But with a home draw and a crop of extremely talented youngsters, who have already beaten a League One side this season in Burton Albion, at his disposal - there's no doubt the youngsters will put up a real fight either way.</p>
      <p>Unsworth's stock has certainly grown over the past two years, and he'll be able to put Barton's bizarre comments behind him when the pair meet regardless of the result.</p>
