      <p>Vets are warning of the ­dangers of “Trojan” dogs ­bringing deadly diseases to the UK, as the number of foreign rescued strays soars.</p>
      <p>The British Veterinary Association is calling on political parties to make compulsory health checks at borders part of their election manifestos, to protect pups on our shores.</p>
      <p>Daniella Dos Santos, BVA President, said: “Adverts for organisations that rehome European dogs are often only a couple of clicks away.</p>
      <p>“But in reality these Trojan dogs often have unknown health histories and may pose a risk to the native pet population and even humans if they bring in new diseases.”</p>

      <p>Imports of dogs through the Pet Travel Scheme have doubled from 150,000 in 2013 to just over 300,000 last year, Defra has revealed.</p>
      <p>It is thought the popularity of ­rescuing a stray from abroad has been fuelled by well-meaning celebrities.</p>
      <p>Actor Orlando Bloom rescued a dog, Sidi, from the streets of Morocco.</p>
      <p>Tennis legend Sue Barker adopted hers from Romania. Ricky Gervais is also patron of a charity that brings rescue dogs to the UK from Romania.</p>
      <p>Daniella added: “We would always advise people to look at rehoming dogs already in the country. There are so many here who deserve a loving home and don’t pose a potential health risk.”</p>
      <p>Vets are particularly worried about potentially fatal leishmaniasis.</p>
      <p>It is common across Europe and can cause skin infections, eye and spleen ­problems and weight loss.</p>
      <p>They have also reported seeing cases of other exotic conditions such as ­ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and heartworm. <br/>Daniella added: “If you already own a rescue dog from abroad, ask a vet for advice on testing and treatment.”</p>
      <p>Designer breeds and cross-breeds bred abroad in unsafe conditions can also bring diseases to the UK.</p>
      <p>A Defra spokesman defended checks already in place at borders, saying: “Every dog must have its ­microchip and passport checked, which helps make sure puppies entering the country are properly vaccinated.”</p>
