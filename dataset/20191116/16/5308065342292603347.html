      <p>Around 1000 affected riders signed up on the first day of registration for the e-scooter trade-in grant.</p>
      <p>GrabFood and Foodpanda released their company’s terms for the trade-in grant this week following the government’s announcement of the S$7 million grant scheme to help affected riders.</p>
      <p>Reports estimate that around 7,000 food delivery riders will be affected by the recent government ban on e-scooters on footpaths.</p>
      <p>Affected food delivery riders may trade in their e-scooters for a bicycle or an electric bicycle co-subsidized by the government and the food delivery companies.</p>

      <p>GrabFood announced that <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/about-1000-delivery-riders-register-to-give-up-e-scooters">more than 20 percent</a> of its affected riders have signed up for the grant yesterday. More than a third of GrabFood’s riders use e-scooters to deliver orders.</p>

      <p>In comparison, an estimated one-third of Foodpanda’s 960 e-scooter riders have signed up online to trade-in their devices for bicycles as initially reported by <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/etg-grant-scheme-launch-food-delivery-riders-escooters-12098070">Channel News Asia</a>.</p>

      <p>The Land Transport Authority will check the applications to prevent duplicates. Foodpanda also advised of a potential delay in e-bicycle deliveries due to the surge in orders.</p>
      <p>GrabFood and Foodpanda riders can also rent bicycles for free from SGBikes while they wait for the e-bicycle replacement.</p>
      <p>Deliveroo declined to provide figures about rider registrations but confirmed that its eligible riders have begun signing up yesterday. The company was the last to announce its terms for the trade-in scheme.</p>
      <p>Deliveroo stated that riders who completed 20 orders between Oct 9 and Nov 7 are qualified for the full amount of the grant while those who completed less than 20 orders will get 80 percent of the grant.</p>
      <p>The remaining 20 percent will be given once they complete 20 more orders within a month of getting the new bicycle./TISG</p>
