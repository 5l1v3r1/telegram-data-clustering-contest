      <h1>Randall "XKCD" Munroe has a New York Times column where he answers weird science questions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:57:25+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Randall Munroe's "Good Question" column in the <i>New York Times</i> is in the vein of his <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/09/03/sept-11-santa-cruz.html">How To</a> and <a href="https://boingboing.net/2014/09/02/xkcds-what-if-dear-abby-f.html">What If</a> books, in which he answers weird science questions with equally weird thoroughness.</p>
      <p>In his inaugural column, Munroe answers: "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/science/randall-munroe-moon.html">If I Touched the Moon, What Would It Feel Like?</a>"</p>
      <blockquote>Touching lunar rocks inside a spacecraft, or in a museum, is one thing; removing a glove and exposing yourself to the vacuum of space is another. In science fiction, terrible things befall such astronauts: their blood boils away, their insides get sucked out. <br/><br/>But removing a glove wouldn’t necessarily be instantly fatal. For the most part, human skin is tough enough to handle brief exposure to a vacuum. If you had a custom spacesuit with a seal around your forearm, you could probably remove your glove during a moonwalk without suffering permanent damage. <br/><br/>It definitely wouldn’t be comfortable. In 1960, during a high-altitude balloon test, Air Force Col. Joe Kittinger’s pressure glove sprang a leak, exposing his right hand to near-vacuum conditions for several hours. His hand swelled up and went numb, but he suffered no permanent damage.</blockquote>
