      <h1>Judicial Service staff bounce back in court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:36:25+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Gifty Amofa, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 16, GNA - The Judicial Service staff on Friday, November 15, returned to work after a two-day strike.</p>
      <p>This was after Mr Alex Nartey, the President of the Judicial Service Association of Ghana (JUSAG) issued a press statement the previous day to suspend the strike action.</p>
      <p>He said the abrogation of the action was on the premise that the leadership of both JUSAG and Management of the Judicial Service met on the issues that necessitated the action.</p>
      <p>The President said Justice Jones Victor Dotse, the Acting Chief Justice had approved that matters raised at the meeting would be forwarded to the Judicial Council.</p>
      <p>Visits at the various courts in Accra by the Ghana News Agency (GNA) saw most staff at post and the courts back to normal.</p>
      <p>Lawyers, litigants and other court users were there to patronise the court’s services.</p>
      <p>As usual, cases were called with a number of them adjourned, but the place looked a little bit deserted because some people did not know service had resumed.  </p>
      <p>Mr Nartey in an interview with GNA denied that the court gave an order to the members to go back to work.</p>
      <p>JUSAG last week threatened an indefinite strike over the need to review their salaries and allowances.</p>
      <p>The members on Wednesday and Thursday, November 13 and 14, respectively started the action until the release on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the National Labour Commission deemed their action illegal.</p>
