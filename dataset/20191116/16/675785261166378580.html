      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:49:52+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Naimah Archibald-Powell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/niamah-archibald-powell/</a></address>
      <p>The devastation that has been wreaked on the Australian bush has been captured in a series of alarming photographs.</p>
      <p>Thousands of fire fighters have been battling a ferocious blaze that has gripped New South Wales and Queensland on the east coast for several days.</p>
      <p>As of Friday morning four people had lost their lives in the natural disaster, with flames made up of 1,600 individual bushfires stretching out across the states.</p>
      <p>Photos taken in NSW show orange and red clouds of heat swallowing up every inch of vegetation, structure and land that is visible in the frame.</p>
      <p>In apocalyptic seeming scenes fire tornadoes can be seen spinning and spewing out clouds of smoke, flames and debris.</p>

      <p>People have been fleeing the fires that have melted road signs and wrecked hundreds of homes.</p>
      <p>Animals can be seen lying on the ground confused and seemingly terrified by the raging flames that surround them.</p>

      <p>While wildfires and bushfires are a part of Australia’s natural ecosystem, the current blazes are unprecedented in terms of their intensity.</p>

      <p>In a direct sense the cause of the fires are either the result of a stray, inadvertently caused spark, or an arsonist - with the country's Centre for Research in Bushfire and Arson suggesting around half of Australia's annual 62,000 bushfires are probably deliberately caused.</p>
      <p>The reason why they are burning for longer, hotter and more intensely than ever is because of climate change.</p>
      <p>Like the UK, Australia is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Australia">getting hotter</a> and is experiencing more droughts - a combination that creates a tinderbox like environment for bushfires.</p>
      <p>Thanks to tree loss, smoke and the perils of heat, approximately 350 koala bears are expected to have perished in the past week.</p>

      <p>This comes after reports that nearly 5,000 acres of an area which acted as a natural habitat for koalas was destroyed during the fires.</p>
      <p>More than $500,000AU has been raised on GoFundMe to help facilitate the rehabilitation of the surviving koalas, but as the fires become more regular, their future is increasingly uncertain.</p>
      <p>An estimated 2.5 million acres of farmland and bushland have been destroyed in total.</p>
      <p>Among the thousands of firefighters risking their lives to save communities and land is pregnant volunteer Kat Robinson-Williams, who refuses to sit out of firefighting operations despite expecting a baby.</p>

      <p>Aircraft such as boeings and helicopters are being used to fly across Australia and dispel water or pink retardant material across the affected areas in a bid to help combat the flames.</p>
      <p>As the pink substance is sprayed and falls down to ground level, the particles spread and swallow up homes, cars, pavements and entire towns.</p>
      <p>More than 300 homes have been destroyed according to the most recent statistics.</p>
      <p>One of these homes belongs to Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe who reassured concerned fans on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> that he, his family and his animals were safe from the flames.</p>
      <p>Poorer parts of the country have unsurprisingly been harder hit by the fires.</p>

      <p>Fairfield was singled out as one of the most deprived areas in Sydney in a report published earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The area, which is currently experiencing fires described as “catastrophic”, is in the midst of a debate about fire fighter funding.</p>
      <p>As these deadly infernos become more common and continue to wreck livelihoods, it is economically deprived areas like Fairfield which will suffer and burn the most.</p>
