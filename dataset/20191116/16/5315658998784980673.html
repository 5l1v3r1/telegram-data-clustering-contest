      <p>New Zealand-based artist Linda Gilbert is releasing a series of small prints from paintings made during her 2019 ‘Matariki Road Trip’ - a solo, van-based art residency that took her to special places around the North Island of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Matariki is the Māori name for the cluster of stars also known as the Pleiades. It rises in mid-winter and heralds the start of a new year.</p>
      <p>Linda travelled more than 4,500 kilometres in her campervan, gathering ideas for 25 gouache paintings that she created on the road.</p>
      <p>These works reference not only a personal transition for the artist, but an enduring interest in “the environment, edges and equity”.</p>
      <p>“This trip was about exploring the land, painting in a small space and challenging myself,” she says. “Winter is traditionally a time of introspection and this journey delivered, giving me the time and space to explore the ‘edges’, literally as well as metaphorically”.</p>
      <p>Now, Linda is making 12 high-quality, A4 prints of her paintings - abstract biomorphic pops of colour that conjure memories of the landscape and places visited - available to everyone who shares her love of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>These exciting new works are priced to reach a wide audience - $50.00 (NZ) unframed and $75.00 (NZ) for framed prints ready to hang. They will only be available from Linda’s website at <a href="http://www.lindagilbert.co.nz/">www.lindagilbert.co.nz</a> from 25 November 2019.</p>
      <p>Linda has exhibited widely and in 2018 she completed a Bachelor of Visual Arts at AUT University in Auckland. This year she was a finalist in The Molly Morpeth Canaday Painting Awards and the Walker &amp; Hall Art Awards.</p>
