      <h2>We need to demand more evidence and real facts concerning the effects of e-cigarettes on our health as news of ill health caused by vaping becomes increasingly common</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:41:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author">Anne Diamond, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/anne-diamond/</a></address>
      <p>More vaping stories have sparked up fears this week. And I worry we’ve been ­sleepwalking into ­another ­cynically ­manufactured and ­dangerous ­social trend.</p>
      <p>We’re now hearing it could damage the brain, heart and blood vessels, and ­cardiologists are calling for a ban.</p>
      <p>Researchers say vaping is creating a new generation of nicotine addicts who don’t really think they are ­inhaling nicotine, and who’ve been told it’s OK.</p>
      <p>If scientists found a safe type of ­alcohol that gave you no hangover, we’d rush at it, right?</p>
      <p>Smoking at first was sold as glamorous – all the Hollywood legends did it. Bette Davis smoked 100 a day until she died – she even smoked while I interviewed her live on air.</p>

      <p>In the 60s, the first headlines linking ciggies to cancer started ­appearing and I was terrified because both my mum and dad smoked. Once the science became clear, Dad gave up his 50 a day overnight but Mum didn’t find it so easy. She’d hide ­packets of ten around the house.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward 50 years and e-cigs are taking hold, with vaping boutiques filling gaps on high streets and parents having cheeky drags at the school gates.</p>
      <p>Yes, clearly, vaping has helped many people quit. So it might have saved ­countless people from the horrors of cancer. You can’t argue with that.</p>
      <p>But there’s a whole load of ­youngsters who have taken it up simply because it was seen as cool, with fruity flavours as appealing as a sugary ­alcopop. The industry has created a new ­market. Keep ­smokers addicted and recruit more.</p>

      <p>Public Health England claims e-cigs are “95 per cent safer than traditional tobacco”. But other, well-respected researchers worldwide are blowing the warning whistle.</p>
      <p>So we need to be demanding more evidence and real facts.</p>
      <p>Better still, don’t trust them alone, make up your own mind. I have two grown-up kids who smoke and I try my very, very best to dissuade them.</p>
      <p>Of course, when you’re in your 20s, you don’t think you’re destroying your health. You don’t think long term.</p>
      <p>But to have health officials telling you it’s OK to vape? Does that sound responsible to you?</p>
      <p>History tells us we may be being duped – and to whose profit?</p>
