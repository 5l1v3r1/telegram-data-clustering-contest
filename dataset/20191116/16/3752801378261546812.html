      <h1>NPA to haul On Point to court, Malema off the hook for now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole McCain</a></address>
      <p>The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has indicated that it will be taking On Point Engineering to court over fraud allegations, but that it will not be prosecuting Julius Malema.</p>
      <p>This was stated in a written response to Afriform, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/afriforum-pushes-npa-to-decide-on-malema-prosecutions-20190710">who in October</a> stated they had plans to go to court to force the NPA to decide on the prosecution of EFF president Malema in three different criminal cases, including the On-Point Engineering tender scandal.</p>
      <p>In the On-Point Engineering tender scandal, it is alleged that the leader of the red berets benefited from an irregularly awarded tender to the tune of R52m.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/no-decision-to-prosecute-malema-yet-npa-20181010">State previously alleged</a> that Malema substantially benefited from the tender payment to On-Point, using it to buy a farm and a Mercedes Benz. It said Malema's Ratanang Family Trust was an indirect shareholder in On-Point. The case was struck off the roll after one of his co-accused fell ill in 2015 and hasn't been back in court since. </p>
      <p>In the correspondence, which News24 has seen and which has been authenticated by Afriforum CEO Kallie Kriel, the NPA states that four accused, representing On-Point Engineering, will be arraigned on a charge of fraud for having misrepresented to the Limpopo Department of Roads and Transport in the award of a tender of around R52m.</p>
      <p>Two of the accused will be charged with a further allegation of fraud, to the same department, based on allegedly false claims that On-Point Engineering was not paid R8m.</p>
      <p>While the NPA has declined to prosecute Malema, the outcomes of the case will be evaluated to determine if he should be prosecuted.</p>
      <p>In addition, the NPA committed to immediately launch an investigation into Malema’s administration of Ratanang Family Trust, after which a decision would be made on whether or not to prosecute.</p>
      <p>The NPA had not responded at the time of publication.</p>
