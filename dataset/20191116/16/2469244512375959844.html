      <h2>Frustrating afternoon for the Grecians who were the better side but couldn't get the win</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:58:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Clark</a></address>
      <p>Exeter City were frustrated by an inability to put chances away as they drew 0-0 at home to a stubborn Cheltenham Town side.</p>
      <p>The Grecians had much the better chances in a scrappy encounter at St James Park but found themselves unable to put any of them in the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Matt Taylor’s men came into the game just one place and one point above the Robins, and the two clubs remain 5 and 6 in the table after the goalless draw.</p>
      <p>Randell Williams down the right was City’s star man but couldn’t hit the target with a number of chances that he created, while the Robins defence make a succession of important blocks to ensure they came away with a point.</p>

      <p>After wholesale changes in midweek, Matt Taylor made two changes to the City side who drew 1-1 in the FA Cup at Cambridge United on Saturday, with Dean Moxey and Jack Sparkes replacing Tom Parkes and Craig Woodman in the back line.</p>
      <p>Michael Duff’s Cheltenham made three changes from their own 1-1 FA Cup draw side with Gavin Reilly, Jake Doyle-Hayes and Jacob Greaves coming into the starting eleven.</p>
      <p>It was the Grecians who started the quickest with Randall Williams down the right hand side causing the Robins problems, with Alex Fisher just unable to get his head of a searching cross.</p>
      <p>Sparkes on the left was causing similar problems with a series of crosses, but sadly for the City youngsters, he failed to find a red shirt with any of them.</p>
      <p>Ryan Bowman had the first real chance of the game and should have given the Grecians the lead in the 19 minute. Jonny Maxted’s long goal kick found its way through to the City striker, but 12 yards out, he dragged his shot just wide of Flinders’ goal.</p>
      <p>Flinders was called into action three minutes later when he forced to make a fingertip save from Sparkes. The academy product found space 30 yards out and lashed a shot on target, but the experienced keeper palmed it away and out of the danger zone.</p>
      <p>Just before the half hour mark, City should have taken the lead. Following a Williams flick-on, Matt Jay got free in the box but his cross across the six yard box couldn’t find a City man. And seconds later, as the Robins failed to clear their lines, Williams robbed Hussey by the corner flag. He tried to find an unmarked Fisher standing on the penalty spot, but a combination of a slightly under-hit pass and Fisher on his feels saw the chance wasted.</p>

      <p>Exeter’s dominance continued and Pierce Sweeney was the next to trouble Flinders. The lively Sparkes fizzed a cross in from deep and Sweeney, still up from a corner, touched the ball on at the near post, but his effort lacked power and Flinders made the save.</p>
      <p>The second half saw City again come out stronger and again Williams was causing their defence problems, and from a short corner, his mazy run and cross saw Luke Varney head the ball away from under his own crossbar.</p>
      <p>It took until the 55 minute for the Robins to have a shot on target. Following Ben Tozer’s long throw that Maxted unconvincingly punched clear, Sean Long scuffed an effort from the edge of the box that bobbled into his arms.</p>
      <p>City then straight up the other end and again Williams was causing havoc in the Cheltenham defence, striking a left footed effort on goal but the recovering Tozer made an important block, before Fisher was agonisingly close with a full length dive to connecting with his a Sparkes cross.</p>
      <p>The Robins had struggled to impose themselves on the game but on the hour mark, only a desperate Aaron Martin block kept the game scoreless. Luke Varney was slipped in by Ryan Broom and just as he was about to pull the trigger, the City centre back got his body in the way to stop the shot.</p>

      <p>Lee Martin replaced Fisher and Taylor’s change almost paid dividend immediately. Firstly he whipped a cross in from the left that deflected off Tozer and forced Flinders into a good save.</p>
      <p>And then he went down in the box after while attempting to control a ball that had ballooned up in the air after a shove in the back from a Cheltenham defender, but referee Alan Young waved the appeals away.</p>
      <p>Bowman, Jay, and Williams also had chances, the latter whistling a curling effort inches wide of the post, but with the clock ticking down, City ran out of ideas to break down the stubborn Robins rear-guard.</p>
      <p>And it was Cheltenham who perhaps could have stolen it. Substitute Alex Addai’s cross was met by Conor Thomas, but 12 yards out, he slipped when shooting and it went wide.</p>
