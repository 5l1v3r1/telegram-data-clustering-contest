        <b>The head of the Independent Election Commission, Hawa Alam Nuristani, said during a Saturday press conference that the vote recount and auditing process will resume in the remaining provinces on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nuristani said that the Independent Election Commission “agreed” with the candidates protesting the process.</p>
      <p>Nuristani mentioned that members of the IEC held “technical meetings” with representatives of the candidates opposing the recount, and they discussed the controversial points.</p>
      <p>The recount of approximately 8,000 votes reportedly began last week ago but was stopped by the IEC on Wednesday after being opposed by many electoral teams.</p>
      <p>The teams of Abdullah Abdullah, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Rahmatullah Nabil, as well as the Presidential Candidates Council, boycotted the recount process.</p>
      <p>The candidates argued that a group of 300,000 tallied votes were not biometrically approved, and should not be included in the recount process.</p>
      <p>IEC chairwoman Nuristani stated today that only biometric votes are valid for the IEC.</p>
      <p>Nuristani thanked the nation for their patience with the delay of the election results announcement.</p>
      <p>The audit and recount process—and the electoral teams’ opposition to the process—are some of the reasons for the delay in announcement, Nuristani said during the press conference.</p>
      <p>The preliminary results have so far been delayed three times.</p>
      <p>The head of the IEC, however, insisted that the preliminary result of the election would be announced "as soon as possible" after the recount and audit process had ended.</p>
