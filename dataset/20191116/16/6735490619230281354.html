      <p>According to a <a href="https://media.uottawa.ca/news/ill-take-famous-uottawa-alum-10-m-alex">press release</a> from the university, the “Jeopardy!” host has decided to “round up the number” of his earlier donations, adding an additional $500,000 to his existing donations for a total to date of a cool $10 million.</p>

      <p>The Alex Trebek Innovation and Challenge Fund, the university states, “finances innovative student-led projects whose aim is to affect positive social change and a healthy and productive lifestyle.”</p>
      <p>“We are extremely grateful for Alex’ generosity, but also for his friendship,” said Jacques Frémont, University of Ottawa President and Vice-Chancellor. “His new gift will benefit more students, and that is at the heart of our mission.”</p>
      <p>Last month, Trebek, 79, <a href="https://media.uottawa.ca/news/alex-trebek-raises-total-financial-commitment-uottawa-95-million-new-gift">donated $2.1 million</a> “to expand the global reach and impact” of the university’s Alex Trebek Forum for Dialogue.</p>

      <p>“The Forum for Dialogue is an essential platform for a university like uOttawa: it provides students with meaningful learning experiences, it encourages discussion and debate, and it showcases the university’s renowned experts and its ideal location in the Canadian capital,” said Trebek in a statement. “It gives students the unique opportunity to grow and learn outside the classroom by listening to some of the most prominent researchers, professionals and dignitaries in Canada, and that is truly important.”</p>
      <p>Following his earlier donation, Frémont praised Trebek for his generosity toward the university. “We are most grateful for the support and the friendship that Alex Trebek has shown the University of Ottawa over the years,” he said. “The Alex Trebek Forum for Dialogue offers our institution the opportunity to create and cultivate a first-class platform to discuss and debate on important provincial, national and international issues, and his new gift will help bolster the impact that it will have.”</p>
