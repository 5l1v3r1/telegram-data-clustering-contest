      <h2>Two goals in three minutes left Magpies with too much to do</h2>

      <p>Notts County suffered their first home defeat since August as Barrow secured a convincing 3-0 win at Meadow Lane.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> got off to a poor start falling behind after just 10 minutes as they found themselves a goal down for the third consecutive game.</p>
      <p>It was a well worked move as Patrick Brough's incisive pass from full-back made its way through to Josh Kay who cut the ball back for Dior Angus who slid the ball under Sam Slocombe.</p>
      <p>Before Notts could even regain their senses, they found themselves two down just three minutes later when an underhit back pass from Enzio Boldewijn was pounced on by Dior Angus.</p>

      <p>The striker still had much to do but kept his composure to pick out John Rooney who converted at the near post.</p>
      <p>Notts tried to engineer a fight back as Boldewijn saw a shot blocked while Wes Thomas couldn't convert from two yards after Ben Turner had headed goalwards from a corner.</p>
      <p>Ardley resisted making changes at half-time as he searched for a way back into the game but Notts' carelessness in possession at times made life even tougher.</p>
      <p>Thomas did flash a shot across goal, but goalkeeper Joel Dixon was rarely called into action while Slocombe made a fine save to thwart Angus.</p>
      <p>But Barrow did have their third goal when substitute Jack Hindle converted at the near post.</p>
      <p>It what was a disappointing afternoon for Notts who lost for the first time at home since being beaten by Barnet in the opening weeks of the season.</p>
