      <p>OCALA, Fla. (AP) â€” Authorities in Florida say a 7-year-old boy was struck and killed riding his bicycle by a hit-and-run teenage driver who was later arrested.</p>
      <p>The Ocala Star Banner <a href="https://www.ocala.com/news/20191115/teen-arrested-after-fatal-hit-and-run-crash-in-sw-marion?rssfeed=true">reports</a> Bryce Benson was riding his bicycle in the Florida Highlands, near Ocala when a 17-year-old driver struck him.</p>
      <p>Florida Highway Patrol troopers say the car was traveling east on a road while Bryce was riding west, when they collided Friday. The teen did not stop afterward, went home and called his grandfather, who called 911.</p>
      <p>Firefighters found the boy lying on the roadway. He was taken to a hospital where he died.</p>
      <p>The teenager was arrested and appeared Saturday before a judge, who ordered him to be held in juvenile detention.</p>
