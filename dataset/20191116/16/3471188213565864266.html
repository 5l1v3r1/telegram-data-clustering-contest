      <h1>Xbox one now has some capacity to work with Google Assistant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:00:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Tann</a></address>
      <p>It was over a year ago that we heard that <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2018/06/04/microsoft-soon-begin-offering-google-assistant-amazon-alexa-support-xbox-one/">Google Assistant and Alexa may come to the Xbox platform</a>. It has been some time in the making but has finally appeared, but with the caveat that it’s public beta — so not quite ready for mainstream use.</p>
      <p>The announcement came from Harrison Hoffman in his role as Senior Program Manager at Xbox and delivered on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders">Reddit: Xbox Insiders</a> with instructions how to get Assistant going.</p>
      <blockquote>Here’s how to get started with the beta:<br/><br/>  1. Join our Google Group with the Google Account you intend to use<br/>  2. Sign into your Xbox<br/>  3. In the Google Home app for iOS or Android:<br/>   •  Tap “+ Add”<br/>   •  Tap “Set up device”<br/>   •  Tap “Have something already set up?”<br/>Search for and select “[beta] Xbox”<br/><br/>Sign in with the Microsoft account you use on Xbox<br/>Follow the instructions to link your Xbox and give it a device name**If no devices are found, try enabling the Digital Assistants setting on your console (Settings &gt; Devices &amp; Streaming &gt; Digital Assistants)*<br/>**If you’re having trouble launching games and apps, try restarting your console.<br/><br/>Once you’re all set up, here are a few actions you can try to get you started with controlling your Xbox One with Google Assistant:<br/><br/>   •  “Hey Google, play Gears 5 on Xbox.”<br/>   •  “Hey Google, turn on Xbox.”<br/>   •  “Hey Google, turn off Xbox.”<br/>   •  “Hey Google, launch YouTube on Xbox.”<br/>   •  “Hey Google, pause on Xbox.”<br/>   •  “Hey Google, resume on Xbox.”<br/>   •  “Hey Google, volume up on Xbox.”<br/>   •  “Hey Google, take a screenshot on Xbox.”</blockquote>

      <p>At the moment the trial is limited to English speaking customers, but work is continuing to expand it to further languages and regions before the Fall in the USA.</p>
      <p>If you’re an Xbox One user, let us know how well the Assistant integration works for you.</p>
