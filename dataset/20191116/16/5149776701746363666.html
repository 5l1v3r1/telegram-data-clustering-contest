      <h1>'Summed up his afternoon' - Notts County player ratings from Barrow defeat</h1>
      <h2>Magpies were beaten 3-0 at Meadow Lane</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:53:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Notts County suffered their first home defeat since August as Barrow secured a 3-0 win at Meadow Lane.</p>
      <p>Here Leigh Curtis gives his verdict on the players on a frustrating afternoon for Neal Ardley's men.</p>
      <p>Sam Slocombe: Beaten by a well worked goal for the first, left in no man's land for the second after a poor back pass from Enzio Boldewijn. Made a good save to deny Angus in the second half. 5</p>
      <p>Richard Brindley: Defender not really seen much as an attacking threat when usually he is a good outlet. Had his hands full with Josh Kay but had a steady game. 5</p>
      <p>Connell Rawlinson: Found Scott Quigley a bit of a handful with the striker being one of the top scorers in the division. But tried to give as good as he got in what was an absorbing battle. 4</p>
      <p>Ben Turner: Dior Angus obviously fancied his pace against the defender's strength and tried his best to keep the forward under wraps but he was always a threat in behind. 4</p>
      <p>Damian McCrory: Had one of those afternoon when his distribution was well below normal standard. Got into some great crossing positions, but overhit them which summed up his afternoon. 4</p>
      <p>Enzio Boldewijn: Passing let him down particularly for the second goal when he under hit a back pass which allowed Barrow to create their second through John Rooney. Will be kicking himself at that mistake. 4</p>

      <p>Mitch Rose: Made one brilliant tackle in the first half, but straight after that he gave the ball away in a dangerous area. Sometimes gets caught in possession far too easily. 4</p>
      <p>Michael Doyle: Frustration with the way the game was heading was evident in the latter stages of the first half. Like the rest of Notts' team, passing was very hit and miss and the captain, like the rest of the team, struggled to find rhythm. 4</p>
      <p>Regan Booty: Played a couple of diagonal passes that picked out Wes Thomas and was happy to go beyond the forwards but wasn't picked out. Almost grabbed a goal out of nothing with a free-kick. 4</p>
      <p>Wes Thomas: The forward always posed a threat with his movement and his pace. Had a chance early on when he was thwarted by the goalkeeper and defender. Never stops going. 6</p>
      <p>Kyle Wootton: A game in which he found very little joy from the centre-backs and as a result chances were very few and far between for the on-loan forward. 4</p>
