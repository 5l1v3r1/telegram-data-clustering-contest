      <p>Two stone inscriptions belonging to the 15th century and 17th century have been found during field work undertaken by Ramesh Hirejambur, a historian, in Shikaripur taluk recently.</p>
      <h3>Found in field</h3>
      <p>The inscription belonging to the 15th century was found in an agricultural field owned by Nagaraj in Hirejambur village. Hirejambur is the native of Satyakka, a 12th century saint and poet who was part of the Vachana movement lead by social reformer Basavanna.</p>
      <p>The inscription speaks of money and land donated by Chandarasa, a local chieftain who owed allegiance to Devaraya 1, the Vijayanagar ruler, for abhishekha and other rituals at Somideva temple in Jambur village.</p>
      <p>The text of the inscription that runs into 11 lines is written in archaic Kannada.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ramesh told <i>The Hindu </i>that another stone inscription was discovered during field work he had undertaken in Talagunda village.</p>
      <p>Talagunda hosts historical Pranavalingeshwara temple said to be constructed by Satavahana kings and renovated and expanded during the rule of Kabamba kings.</p>
      <p>The stone inscription issued in the 17th century was found in the agricultural land east to Prabhudevara Mutt in Talagunda.</p>
      <p>The inscription speaks of gold coins and land donated by Keladi queen Channamma to the Viraktha Mutt in Talagunda as per the request of Siruvegara Malingaiah of Udugani fort nearby.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hirejambur said that Udugani was an important administrative unit during the Keladi rule.</p>
