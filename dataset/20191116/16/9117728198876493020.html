        <b>Alex Albon crashed in practice once again on Friday running at the Brazilian Grand Prix, but his Aston Martin Red Bull Racing team boss Christian Horner says he is not worried by the frequency of these incidents, with the Thai driver hitting the walls numerous times in practice sessions this season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Albon went back out in FP1 on slick tyres perhaps too early, and ran wide at Juncao, crashing tamely into the barriers and breaking his suspension. The crash brought out the red flag and with hardly any time left in the session, the crash ended FP1.</p>

      <p>Albon also crashed in China, Hungary, Russia and Mexico, but Horner says he is not concerned by the regularity of the incidents.</p>
      <p>During the team bosses press conference, birthday boy Horner said: <i>"I think today wasn’t… you can’t put on Alex’s account. I think maybe we were a little bit too optimistic getting out there, trying to get him laps in on a track that was still pretty damp in the middle sector.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Max, as I say, he had a moment at turn one, turn two. There were other cars that were running wide so I don’t think today we can blame that on Alex but he has had a few little incidents this year. Thankfully they’ve all been on Fridays and Saturday mornings. When it’s come to it in qualifying and the race he’s absolutely delivered."</i>
