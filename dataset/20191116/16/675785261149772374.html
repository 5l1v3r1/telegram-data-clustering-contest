      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or credentials questioned by former teammate</h1>
      <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo is on the 30-man shortlist to claim his sixth Ballon d'Or but is behind the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Lionel Messi in the race for the prestigious award</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:15:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Iker Casillas reckons that it wouldn't be "very logical" if former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> teammate <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was awarded the Ballon d'Or this year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> superstar Ronaldo was included on the 30-man shortlist for the prestigious gong - which will be handed out at France Football's annual ceremony in Paris on December 2.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old had a lean season by his incredibly high standards, as he helped Juve lift the Serie A.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo produced his worst goal return since his last season at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> - as he only managed 28 goals in 43 appearances, having scored between 42 and 61 in his previous eight seasons at Real.</p>

      <p>Because of that he is not seen as one of the front runners for the Ballon d'Or, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Virgil van Dijk the bookmaker's favourite to walk about with silverware.</p>
      <p>And keeper Casillas thinks the award should be between van Dijk and Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>"Van Dijk was the best player in UEFA. Messi was the best for FIFA. Imagine Cristiano (on his merit) winning the Golden Ball," Casillas wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>

      <p>"It seems to me that the criteria we follow in football to give prizes are not very logical, right? Friday's reflection."</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has already won five Ballon d'Ors during his glittering career - but according to his mother he should have had even more.</p>
      <p>"There is a mafia. That's the right word to define it. Yes, there is a mafia in football," she told the Portuguese press.</p>
      <p>"If there wasn’t a football mafia, my son would have more [individual] international trophies. If you see everything that happened, you will realise that it is the mafia.</p>
      <p>"If he was Spanish or English they would not do what they did to him. But since he's Portuguese and from Madeira... well, this happens.”</p>
