      <p>Godrej Locks, a business unit of Godrej &amp; Boyce Mfg. Co. Ltd., is eyeing double-digit growth this year and hopes to continue the growth momentum.</p>
      <p>The company is also planning to sharply enhance its exports business, a top executive said.</p>
      <p>“We are driving international business very muscularly. We have a good footprint today with [presence] in, in and around India, the SAARC countries, the Middle East and the entire sub-Saharan Africa. There are plans to get into more and more countries,” Shyam Motwani, executive VP and business head, Godrej Locks, said in an interview.</p>
      <p>The firm now exports to over 27 countries. “Currently, 3-4% of the revenue comes from exports and our plan is to take it to 25% of our revenues,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the company is aiming to cater to the requirements of the Indian diaspora living all over the world and who understand and know the brand well.</p>
      <p>“Over time, we will improve the share of international revenue and take it to the desired aspiration of 25% of total revenue.”</p>
      <p>The company is also raising the share of digital locks in the product mix. From FY15 to FY19, its digital door locks segment grew at a CAGR of 13%.</p>
