      <p><b>Ohio:</b> Authorities have charged the husband of a malnourished 11-year-old girl's legal guardian.</p>
      <p>Authorities learned about the girl's mistreatment from a teacher administering an online test, local television WXIX-TV reported. The girl said she was hungry and explained she was given just a small plate of rice each day.</p>
      <p>The girl weighed 21.3 kilograms, roughly 20kg below the average weight for a girl her age. Authorities said she lived in deplorable conditions in a locked trailer monitored by a surveillance camera.</p>
      <p>The girl was living in filth and had been isolated for years, forced to sleep at times on a urine-stained mattress, said Brown County prosecutor Zac Corbin.</p>
      <p>She was homeschooled and took the online test from home so that she could remain being taught there, authorities said.</p>
      <p>WXIX-TV reported 61-year-old Charles Breeze was in custody at a Cincinnati hospital. Breeze was indicted Brown County on endangering children, felonious assault and kidnapping charges.</p>
      <p>Forty-seven-year-old Margaret Breeze was indicted on those charges last month. It's unclear whether Charles Breeze has an attorney.</p>
