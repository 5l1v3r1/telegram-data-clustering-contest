      <p>When <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i> hit theaters in 2012, fans knew that it was time to say goodbye to Christopher Nolan’s version of Gotham City. The director <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1550609/why-the-dark-knight-rises-delivers-the-perfect-ending-to-nolans-batman-trilogy-according-to-joseph-gordon-levitt">made it extremely clear</a> that he was going to contain his <i>Batman</i> franchise to a trilogy. He’s kept his word, but hasn’t really said much else on the matter. Now <i>The Dark Knight Trilogy</i>’s star, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479415/christian-bale-still-only-has-one-piece-of-advice-now-that-robert-pattinsons-the-new-batman">Christian Bale</a>, has given some insight as to why Christopher Nolan didn’t make a fourth film.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with the <a href="https://torontosun.com/entertainment/movies/pure-bloody-excitement-christian-bale-puts-pedal-to-the-metal-in-ford-v-ferrari">Toronto Sun</a>, Christian Bale was frank when the conversation turned toward his iconic portrayal of Bruce Wayne and his collaboration with Christopher Nolan. He told the newspaper:</p>
      <blockquote>We knew we had to reinvent it. I literally had people laugh at me when I told them we were doing a new kind of Batman. I think that the reason it worked was first and foremost Chris’ take on it. But also we never were arrogant to assume that we had an opportunity beyond one film at a time. That’s something that Chris always would talk about. He’d say, 'This is it. We’re making one film. That’s all we’ve got.' Then when they came and said, 'You want to go make another?' It was fantastic, but we still said, 'This is it. We will not get another opportunity.' Then they came and they said, 'OK, let’s do a third one.' Chris had always said to me that if we were fortunate to be able to make three we would stop. 'Let’s walk away after that.'</blockquote>
      <p>It’s no surprise that Christopher Nolan had a clear vision going into the franchise. A large part of what made <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Batman-Begins-993.html"><i>Batman Begins</i></a>, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Dark-Knight-3244.html"><i>The Dark Knight</i></a>, and <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i> so successful was their individual strengths as films <i>and</i> their ability to work as a cohesive trilogy. Christian Bale revealed to the Toronto Sun that he fully supported Nolan’s creative mission, even when presented with the chance to expand the franchise. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>Then when they inevitably came to us and said, 'How about a No. 4?' I said, 'No. We have to stick to Chris’ dream, which was always to, hopefully, do a trilogy. Let’s not stretch too far and become overindulgent and go for a fourth. That’s why we, well Chris, stepped away. After that I was informed my services were no longer required (laughs).</blockquote>
      <p>It’s safe to say we’ll never see Christian Bale suit up as Batman again. But at the very least, Christopher Nolan putting a hard stop to his series reignited cinematic interest in the franchise. And in that way, the end of <i>The Dark Knight Trilogy</i> made room for a new era of intriguing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2466137/the-batman"><i>Batman</i></a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484942/joker-is-officially-crossing-the-1-billion-mark"><i>Batman</i>-adjacent</a> projects.</p>
