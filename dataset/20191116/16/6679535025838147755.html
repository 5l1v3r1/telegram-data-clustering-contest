      <p>A profligate K. Srikanth was knocked out of the $400,000 Hong Kong Open following a semifinal defeat to local favourite Lee Cheuk Yiu here on Saturday. Yiu won 21-9, 23-25.</p>
      <p>The former World No. 1, Srikanth squandered six game points in the second game in contest that lasted 42-minutes.</p>
      <p>It was his first semifinal appearance since making the last four at the India Open Super 500. He had finished runner-up at the event.</p>
      <p>Srikanth fell back early in the opening game with Lee opening up a 6-1 lead. The Indian tried to catch up but failed to narrow the gap.</p>
      <p>In the second game, Srikanth stepped up the gas taking an early 5-1 lead. However, Lee soon restored parity.</p>
      <p>The shuttlers fought neck and neck with Srikanth surging ahead but the Indian lost momentum, eventually conceding the match.</p>
      <p>Srikanth had beaten the 23-year-old Lee in straight games at the India Open last year in their only career meeting.</p>
      <p>With Srikanthâ€™s defeat, the Indian challenge here also came to an end.</p>
