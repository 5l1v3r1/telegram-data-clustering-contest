      <h1>BMW i4 Will Be A Serious Threat To The Tesla Model 3</h1>
      <h2>From these new specification details, the BMW i4 will be a formidable rival to the Model 3.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:40:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>As part of its <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bmw-expects-evs-to-make-up-25-percent-of-sales-by-2025">upcoming EV onslaught</a>, BMW is preparing to unleash a new i4 electric sedan that has the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3 </a>directly in its sights. While BMW has already confirmed how much range the i4 will have, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-bmw-i4-official-details/">CNET Roadshow</a> claims to know the electric sedan's performance specifications. If true, the i4 will be a formidable competitor to the Model 3.</p>
      <p>Slated to go into production in 2021, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/i4">BMW i4 </a>will initially be powered by an 80-kilowatt-hour battery, producing roughly 530 horsepower. This will enable the electric sedan to accelerate to 62 mph from a standstill in around four seconds flat and hit an electronically-limited top speed of 120 mph.</p>

      <p>The i4 will also use BMW's new Generation 5 battery packs, which are significantly smaller than the Generation 3 and 4 packs used in the company's current EVs. As a result, the cells are easier to package in the car's floor and can be easily scaled for smaller or larger vehicles.</p>
      <p>As for range, the i4 will last approximately 373 miles on a single charge based on Europe's WLTP cycle. Expect the range to come down to around 340-350 miles in the US, however. Using a 150-kW DC fast charger, BMW told the publication the i4 should be able to achieve an 80 percent charge in about 35 minutes. The i4 can also add around 62 miles of range in about six minutes, compared to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/i3">BMW i3</a> that can do the same in about 17 minutes.</p>

      <p>For comparison, the entry-level Model 3 Standard Range Plus model produces 258 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque while delivering an EPA range of 250 miles. The range-topping Performance model still falls short of the i4 with a dual motor setup delivering 450 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque and 310 miles of range.</p>
      <p>Encouragingly, these specs also only apply to the base model, as BMW confirmed that additional variants will be available with more power and range. The i4 will ride on a new modular architecture that packages the motor, transmission and electronics and can be mounted at the front or rear axles to provide front-, rear- or all-wheel drive where needed. The BMW i4 is expected to arrive in late 2021.</p>
