      <h1>Lupita Nyong’o Forced To Drop Out Of James Woo’s Remake Of ‘The Killer’ Due To ‘Scheduling Problem’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:20:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>Lupita Nyong’o’s acting services are in high demand right now — just ask director James Woo, who cast her in his upcoming English-language remake of his 1989 Hong Kong action thriller “The Killer”, but then lost her when script revisions took longer than expected and she was forced to move onto another project.</p>
      <p>“There was a scheduling problem because she’s so popular right now!” Woo told <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/john-woo-lupita-nyongo-the-killer-remake-face-off-reboot-comic-book-movies-martin-scorsese-1202787915/"><i>Deadline</i></a> of Nyong’o’s exit from the film. “We rewrote the script and it took so much time… she had to leave for another project.”</p>
      <p>In the original, Yun-Fat Chow plays an assassin who wants to quit the business in order to take care of a lounge singer who he accidentally blinded during a hit. For his remake, Woo cast Nyong’o in the assassin role, and while he has yet to recast he told <i>Deadine </i>he’s still planning on a female lead.</p>

      <p>“The biggest reason why I wanted to do this movie again because [I wanted] ‘the killer’ to be a woman — that’s exciting to me,” said Woo. “It will make the movie have a different look.”</p>
      <p>Like fellow directors Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, Woo says he doesn’t see himself ever directing a Marvel movie.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have that gift,” he admitted. “I’m not a sci-fi guy — I don’t think I could make a good one. There’s so much imagination… I don’t think I can reach that level.”</p>
