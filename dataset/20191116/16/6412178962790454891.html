        <b>Moise Kean’s summer switch to Everton has been labelled a mistake by the attacker’s father.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Italy Under-21 forward joined the Toffees from Juventus in a £27million move last summer, but he is yet to score a goal for his new club having played just nine games.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was also omitted from last week’s win at Southampton <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/troubles-for-moise-kean-as-striker-is-axed-after-everton-rule-breach"><b>after reportedly being late for a team meeting</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Centro Suono Sport</i>, Jean Kean revealed that he hopes for his son to return to Italy ‘as soon as possible’, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/agent-of-everton-flop-in-talks-with-ac-milan-over-january-switch"><b>with AC Milan a potential destination</b></a>.</p>
      <p>“Sending my son to England was a mistake, because he’s still too young,” he said. “He’s not feeling good at Everton, I didn’t like this transfer.</p>
      <p>“I hope he can come back to Italy as soon as possible, I hope he goes to Rome, but the important thing is that he comes back here.”</p>
      <p>Kean Sr also revealed his unhappiness at agent Mino Raiola’s influence on his son.</p>

      <p>“I don’t have a relationship with Raiola, I have never met him, I don’t think he even wants to see me.</p>
      <p>“He demanded my son’s power of attorney when he was 14 and together with my ex-wife he wanted to take him to England.</p>
      <p>“At Everton, where he is playing now, he is not settling in well. I think he was supposed to wait a few more years before he had an experience abroad.</p>
      <p>“If there is a possibility for him to come back to Italy, I hope he can do that, so as not to ruin him.”</p>
