      <h1>Alaina Gassler is an 8th Grader Who Designed a Way to Help Reduce Car Crashes</h1>

      <p>I always love seeing some of the latest ideas in the world of science and technology. Well, a few weeks ago, <b>Alaina Gassler</b> unveiled her project to help eliminate blind spots in cars for safer driving. The idea is a rather simple one, a webcam has its video projected onto a screen covering the structural pillars of a car. See, simple. However, this use is genius, especially if it can, in fact, help reduce the number of car collisions.</p>
      <p>To make things even more impressive is that Gassler is an eighth-grader and this idea won her 25,000 at the Broadcom MASTERS competition in October. You can check out footage from Gassler’s prototype and a brief interview with her below. I think it’d be great if we could find a way to make this a more mainstream reality.</p>
