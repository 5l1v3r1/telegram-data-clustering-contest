      <h1>Aston Villa fans praise John McGinn after Scotland performance</h1>

      <p>John McGinn helped Scotland win away in Cyprus during a European Championship qualifier – and some Aston Villa fans on Twitter were left hailing their midfielder.</p>
      <p>Steve Clarke’s Scotland outfit recorded a 2-1 victory against Cyprus, which lifted them to third in their group standings.</p>
      <p>Ryan Christie put the visitors in front with a stunning curling effort from the edge of the box with his favoured left foot, but Cyprus did equaliser shortly after half-time through an eye-catching Georgios Efrem volley.</p>
      <p>McGinn scored the winner in the 53rd minute with his neat first-time finish inside the box from a wide cross.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has been in speculator form at club level for Villa this campaign and the same could be said for his international displays.</p>
      <p>His winning goal against Cyprus comes after he scored a hat-trick in the 6-0 victory against San Marino in the last Scotland fixture in October.</p>
      <p>He is a central midfielder full of energy and technique, but his best asset has to be the way he drives forward into the final third and helps out in attack.</p>
      <p>McGinn already has three goals and two assists in the Premier League so far this season, which is why he’s played every minute for Dean Smith’s side so far in the top-flight.</p>
