      <p>Can you help reunite this beautiful wedding band with its owner?</p>
      <p>When Linda McLean purchased a new pair of gloves from Primark, on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland-street">Northumberland Street</a> , she had no idea there was anything unusual about them.</p>
      <p>Mrs McLean, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">Grange Villa, County Durham,</a> had tried on the right glove from the pair of the ordinary-looking leather gloves before deciding to buy them.</p>
      <p>But when she got home and put on the pair, she was in for a suprise.</p>

      <p>She said: "I could feel something inside the left one - I thought, 'they've left the security disk inside', but when I put my hand in I realised it was it was in the wedding finger, and it was a ring.</p>
      <p>"I was just devastated for whoever had lost it. I phoned Primark and some of the other shops on Northumberland Street, but no one had reported it missing.</p>
      <p>"It's so easily done, they could just slip off inside a glove, and I was the next person to have picked those gloves up."</p>
      <p>Mrs McLean bought the gloves at between 11am and 12pm on Thursday, November 14, but says she doesn't know how long the ring could have been stuck for before she found them.</p>
      <p>She's now hoping that, with the help of Chronicle Live and the public, she can return the ring to the couple who've lost it.</p>
      <p>She said: "There's a lovely inscription on the inside, so if someone gets in touch I'll know if it's really theirs if they can tell me what it is.</p>
      <p>"It would just be such a lovely Christmas present if I could get it back to them."</p>
