        <b>Inter Milan have revealed they received a threatening letter containing a bullet in the post, but denied that manager Antonio Conte was the target.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Italian newspaper <i>Corriere della Sera </i>had reported that the former Chelsea boss had received the letter to his home address, but Inter have denied that took place.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Conte’s wife Elisabetta Muscarello wrote on social media: “For the record: the story of the bullet is a hoax!”</p>
      <p>“In relation to the news published today, Inter Milan states that Antonio Conte did not personally receive any threatening letters and, consequently, he did not go in person to file a complaint,” the club statement said.</p>
      <p>“It was the club that received a letter and, as is the practice in this kind of situation, it contacted the competent authorities.”</p>
      <p>Conte took over from Luciano Spalletti at the San Siro over the summer and has guided them to second, behind his former club Juventus, at the top of Serie A.</p>
