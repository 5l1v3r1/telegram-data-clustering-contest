      <p>She’s a real housewife of the cocaine cartel, and now she’s sashaying her way into your living room.</p>
      <p>Emma Coronel Aispuro, better known as Mrs. El Chapo, makes her reality-TV debut Monday — aboard a sleek yacht in Miami, wearing dark glasses and a white, cleavage-baring eyelet blouse.</p>
      <p>Her VH1 “Cartel Crew” cast-mates — the sons and daughters of notorious drug dealers — swoon in her presence, impressed by her celebrity as the loyal wife of convicted Mexican kingpin Joaquin Guzman Loera, who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/17/el-chapo-whines-about-torture-of-lockup-before-sentencing/">sentenced to life in a supermax American prison</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“I was very nervous and humbled to be in her presence,” Marie Ramirez Arellano, the daughter of an unidentified Miami-based former drug trafficker and a regular on the show, told The Post. “She’s not a regular woman.”</p>
      <p>Coronel, 30, who married the former Sinaloa cartel boss, now 62, when she was a teenager, is making <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/el-chapos-wife-emma-coronel-aispuro-in-talks-to-join-vh1s-cartel-crew/">“several” appearances on the hour-long program.</a></p>
      <p>In Monday’s episode Coronel meets with Ramirez Arellano and her boyfriend Michael Corleone Blanco, the youngest son of one of the most notorious members of the Medellin cartel in Colombia. (And yes, that is his real name.)</p>
      <p>Griselda Blanco de Trujillo was known as the Godmother of Cocaine. She picked up another moniker — the Black Widow — for her part in the murder of more than 200 people. Based in Queens in the 1970s, her cocaine empire brought in more than $80 million a month. Indicted for drug trafficking in the US, she was deported to Colombia, where she was shot dead outside a Medellin butcher shop in 2012.</p>

      <p>Blanco, who said he helped run his mother’s drug enterprise when he was a teenager, now heads up a legitimate business — cartel-themed T-shirts, hoodies and tank tops. Some are emblazoned with his mother’s image, others piles of cocaine. The company, Pure Blanco, is also making inroads into the legal sales of cannabis, he told The Post.</p>
      <p>“We are not our parents,” said Blanco, adding that 22 of his relatives died in drug-related violence. “We’re trying to make our own way in the world. Legally.”</p>
      <p>Blanco, whose head is shaved and whose arms are covered in tattoos, met with Coronel on her yacht to discuss business, he told The Post.</p>
      <p>“I gave her some advice because she is trying to make the same kind of moves that I made,” he said. “She is a really sweet person who is going through something that no wife or mother should ever go through and now she has to raise two girls by herself.”</p>
      <p>Coronel, the mother of 7-year-old twins, is trying to capitalize on El Chapo’s notoriety.</p>
      <p>Following the trial, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/06/el-chapos-wife-and-daughter-launch-competing-fashion-lines/">she registered the “El Chapo Guzman” trademark</a> to market a line of clothing, cell phone cases and hats, public records show.</p>
      <p>Coronel was a constant presence in the Brooklyn federal courtroom during her husband’s three and a half month trial. El Chapo was convicted of drug trafficking and murder charges in February and is currently <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/19/el-chapo-seen-for-last-time-before-heading-to-supermax-in-colorado/">serving a life sentence in the country’s highest-security prison</a> in Colorado where other inmates include the Unabomber. Law enforcement<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/17/el-chapo-will-never-see-his-beauty-queen-wife-again/"> refused to allow Coronel any access</a> to her husband.</p>
      <p>“She’s a real Latina, a real humble person, loyal to her man,” Ramirez Arellano said. “She gave off such great energy and she’s a real classy woman.”</p>
