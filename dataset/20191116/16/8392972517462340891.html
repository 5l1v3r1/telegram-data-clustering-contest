      <p>Naomi Campbell has declared her 'heart is happy' after falling in love with a mystery person.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old supermodel - <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/naomi-campbell-cools-off-romance-with-liam-payne/">who dated Liam Payne earlier this year</a> - revealed her dating status to <a href="https://gu.com/">The Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>Asked whether she is in love, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/naomi-campbell-shares-airplane-selfie-showing-her-clean-her-own-seat-with-anti-bac-wipes/">Naomi</a> replied: "Yes. It's [bleep]ing hectic! It's actually not someone that you know, but my heart… my heart is happy."</p>
      <p>The London-born fashion icon also noted how she has come to realise she has to 'love herself' rather than expect to be 'validated' by love from someone else.</p>

      <p>Naomi also revealed she is still close to all of her exes "except one".</p>
      <p>And it seems that the end of a relationship does not mean the conclusion of her caring about a former partner.</p>
      <aside>My heart is happy.</aside>
      <p>"You come for someone that I love and care about, I'm defending them," she insisted.</p>
      <p>She also explained how therapy has helped her to "stay in the light" - and praised the likes of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/">Prince William</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/">Prince Harry</a> for helping decrease stigma around mental health.</p>

      <p>"I don't want to be in darkness. I don't have depression, but mental health is something that I care about a lot and it makes me happy to know that [the UK] is taking mental health seriously now," she said.</p>
      <p>Back in April, Naomi <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/naomi-campbell-cools-off-romance-with-liam-payne/">reportedly called off her romance</a> with One Direction star Liam because she was "bored" of him.</p>
      <p>The pair were thought to have begun secretly dating at the end of 2018 and subsequently appeared at many of the same events, including Hong Kong’s Formula E lunch in Japan.</p>

      <p>An anonymous source told <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/naomi-campbell-cools-off-romance-with-liam-payne/">a tabloid newspaper</a>: "Naomi has taken the decision to let things fizzle out. She’s just not into Liam any more and has cast him aside. Quite simply she got a bit bored.</p>
      <p>"He was always the more keen, slightly needy one and, as far as she was concerned, they were never officially an item anyway. It’s always been very casual."</p>
