      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Outlines His Expectations For Nebraska, Scott Frost</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:07:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday morning, the Nebraska football program announced a contract extension for head coach Scott Frost.</p>
      <p>The two-year extension keeps Frost with the team through 2026. Frost’s program sits at 4-5 on the season, just a year after finishing 4-8.</p>
      <p>It’s an improvement, but the final three games of the regular season come against tough opponents. It starts this weekend against Wisconsin and the Huskers also still have Iowa on the schedule as well.</p>
      <p>For the Huskers fans worried about the state of the program, ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit has a message for you.</p>
      <p>Have some patience.</p>
      <p>Herbie said it could take another two years before Frost finally turns the corner. Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://saturdaytradition.com/nebraska-football/nebraska-still-two-years-away-from-becoming-serious-b1g-contender-kirk-herbstreit-says/">Saturday Tradition</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“A lot of people were talking in July about — I didn’t see it — but thought this was their year to get to Indianapolis. This is a team that needs two more years of recruiting, just continuing to build the foundation. They have Wan’Dale Robinson and JD Spielman, but they just don’t have the playmakers to compete week in and week out on either side of the ball.”</blockquote>
      <p>As for Wan’Dale Robinson, it <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/nebraska-cornhuskers/huskers-insider-has-update-on-nebraskas-wandale-robinson">doesn’t look like he’ll suit up</a> this weekend against Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>However, the future is bright for this Huskers program – if they can just have some patience building a quality roster.</p>
