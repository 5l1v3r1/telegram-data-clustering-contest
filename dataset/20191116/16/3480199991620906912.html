      <p>A staff member at a local bar helped a student evacuated during the blaze in Bolton to source emergency medication after she left hers in her room.</p>
      <p>Ellie Cornish forgot to pick up her medication, which prevents seizures caused by PTSD, when she dashed out of her building adjacent to The Cube – but police told her she could not return to collect it.</p>
      <p>Cocktails and Co gave the 19-year-old shelter and a hot chocolate, and a staff member helped her organise an emergency prescription for the medicine.</p>
      <p>“Seeing my panicked and upset state, she offered to call 111 for me to get an emergency prescription,” Ms Cornish told the PA news agency.</p>
      <p>“Emotionally, I was experiencing panic attacks as I was initially alone on the street, surrounded by fire engines and police.</p>
      <p>“I was worried about my medication as I was in a heightened state of stress and that can cause seizures for me.”</p>

      <p>Ms Cornish, from Bedfordshire, was able to collect the prescription late on Friday and is now staying with a friend. She said she has “no idea” when she will be allowed back to her flat.</p>
      <p>Another student criticised fire safety in the building and said while alarms were set off in hallways, those in students’ rooms were not – making the warnings difficult to hear.</p>
      <p>Melissa McGarrigle told PA: “The fire alarms in the corridor went off but they aren’t particularly loud, especially if you’re asleep.</p>
      <p>“It just doesn’t feel real, everyone thought it was just the fire alarms acting up as usual until we heard people screaming.”</p>
      <p>Labour’s Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has said The Cube does not have the same cladding as Grenfell Tower did, but does have a form which “causes concern and raises issues”.</p>

      <p>Ms McGarrigle said students were not warned of any potential cladding fire hazards when they moved into the flats.</p>
      <p>“We were warned about nothing, thought The Cube was safe,” she said.</p>
      <p>One eyewitness described the fire as “crawl[ing] up the cladding like it was nothing”.</p>
      <p>Ace Love, 35, said: “The fire kept getting more intense, climbing up and to the right because the wind was blowing so hard.</p>
      <p>“We could see it bubbling from the outside and then being engulfed from the outside.</p>
      <p>“A lot of students got out very fast, someone was very distressed, the rest were on phones calling for help.</p>
      <p>“The fire got worse and worse, to the point where you could see through the beams, it was just bare frame.”</p>

      <p>Ryan Pardon, 24, was evacuated from a block next to The Cube due to smoke and compared the blaze to the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>
      <p>“It was thick black smoke coming into our apartment… just couldn’t see or breathe,” Mr Pardon told PA.</p>
      <p>“It sounds daft but you start thinking how you’re going to get out, you start thinking you are in Grenfell Tower.”</p>
      <p>Asked about the Grenfell Tower comparison, Mr Pardon said: “It’s not the same cladding but it’s the same situation.”</p>
      <p>The Bolton local said he stayed at his brother’s last night and has been told he cannot return to his home until Tuesday.</p>
