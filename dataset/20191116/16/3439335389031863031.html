      <p>Honolulu firefighters rescued a 64-year-old man from a burning pickup tonight after the truck he was driving crashed over the makai guardrail of the Kalanianaole Highway on the Waimanalo side of the entrance of Hanauma Bay.</p>
      <p>Traffic was stopped in both directions as fire units rushed to free the driver, who was trapped by the crushed roof of a vehicle that rolled at least 50 feet or on makai side of the highway, said Honolulu Fire Department Capt. Scot Seguirant.</p>
      <p>Crews found the pickup at 8:18 p.m. burning in both the engine compartment and the rear of the vehicle and quickly moved to pop the door open, Seguirant said.</p>
      <p>“The man walked to the ambulance. His only complaint was that the steam was too hot,” he said. “Pretty amazing.”</p>
      <p>The man was transferred to an ambulance by 8:24 p.m. and taken to an area hospital, where he is listed in serious condition.</p>
      <p>Crews put out the fire at 8:29 p.m.</p>
