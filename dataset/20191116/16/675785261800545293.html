      <h2>Private secretary Catherine Quinn has stood beside the Duchess of Cambridge since October 2017, but will now reportedly step back to focus on her charity work</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T16:50:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 16:50</time> by <a rel="author">Grace Witherden</a></address>
      <p>Kate Middleton will be looking for a new private secretary after her right-hand woman quit the role following two years of royal service, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Catherine Quinn, who has been responsible for organising the Duchess of Cambridge's diary and accompanying her on engagements, will be leaving the demanding role to focus on her charity work, the Daily Mail reports.</p>
      <p>However the pair are said to be parting on the "best of terms".</p>
      <p>The future queen has had a string of staff leave in recent years, just last month one of her personal assistants, Sophie Agnew, was made redundant and Lorraine Heggessey quit as CEO of the couple's Royal Foundation this autumn.</p>
      <p>Ms Quinn's predecessor Rebecca Deacon, who left the post in 2017, stayed in the role for 10 years and was often spotted supporting the Duchess at royal engagements.</p>

      <p>Ms Quinn has worked as Kate's private secretary since October 2017 and is said to have been instrumental in helping her develop her 'early years' project.</p>
      <p>The project will see academics, practitioners and charities brought together to form a new steering group to focus on giving children the best possible start in life.</p>
      <p>Ms Quinn, who was educated at Oxford, has also held positions on the boards of the Charity Commission for England and Wales, The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> , The Royal British Legion and The National Memorial Arboretum.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one's six-figure salary was paid by Prince Charles, through his private income from the Duchy of Cornwall.</p>
      <p>A source told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7565339/Duchess-Cambridges-aide-falls-victim-brothers-break-Kate-makes-redundant.html">Daily Mail</a> : "Catherine is a thoroughly lovely lady and has achieved a lot working for the Duchess. But she simply wants to take a step back and focus again on her charity work.</p>
      <p>"She has done an incredible job but just wants some more time for other interests and feels she has helped the Duchess create a solid platform in order to move forward.</p>
      <p>"They are parting on the best of terms."</p>

      <p>Whoever takes on Ms Quinn's role is sure to have a busy few months ahead of them, with Kate set to make some major announcements next year on her work with young children.</p>
      <p>A private secretary's duties include organising official programmes and engagements and ensuring Kate is briefed on who she is going to meet.</p>
      <p>However her staff have always spoken highly of her and said she takes the time to listen to them.</p>

      <p>In September, a source told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7511869/How-Kate-Middleton-reinvented-Duchess-Dazzle.html">The Mail on Sunday's You magazine</a> , that the Duchess is a reasonable boss.</p>
      <p>They said: “She takes the time to listen to ideas from the most junior members in her team</p>
      <p>“She is very clear on her priorities and that values that guide how she lives and works. It’s about treating other people well to get the best out of them.”</p>
      <p>It has not been announced yet who is set to replace Catherine Quinn in the position.</p>
