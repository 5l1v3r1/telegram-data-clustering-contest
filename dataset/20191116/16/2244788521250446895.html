        <b>SERIAKE Henry Dickson, Bayelsa governor who is a member of the People’s Democratic Party, has described the ongoing gubernatorial election in the state a sad commentary on the nation’s democracy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dickson made the statement while speaking with reporters at the Polling Unit 5, Ward 2, Sagbama of Bayelsa where he cast his vote.</p>
      <p>“Gentlemen of the press, today is a sad commentary on our nation’s democracy,” he <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/south-south-regional/363517-its-a-sad-day-gov-dickson-says-of-bayelsa-election.html">told</a></b> journalists on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Accompanied with his wife and aides, Dickson said election had not taken place in Southern Ijaw, except Amassoma.</p>
      <p>“As we are speaking, in this day and age, gun-wielding militiamen, with the aid of security forces, have overrun hapless electoral officials. Most of the electoral officials in Southern Ijaw, as we speak, are kidnapped and held hostage.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows APC has no structure in Bayelsa to win an election, but they have armed militias, surveillance contractors, who kill and maim for APC,” he said.</p>
      <p>While Dickson described himself as a “man of peace” who would stand for peace and respect for human dignity, he accused the All Progressives Congress of recruiting the Nigerian army and officers of the Nigeria Police Force to work against citizens’ right to vote. </p>
      <p>“This has been the lots, this has been what we have been managing since 2015, with the APC at the centre is not caring about the dignity of our people,” he said</p>
      <p>He said the APC and federal government were “too hungry” to make Nigeria a one-party state.</p>
      <p>The governorship election is ongoing in Bayelsa and Kogi states. While vote counting has been completed in some polling units in both states, voting is still ongoing at some polling units.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there have been <b><a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/incidence-of-violence-ballot-snatching-wrecks-election-in-kogi/">reported</a></b> cases of violence, ballot snatching and vote-buying in both Kogi and Bayelsa States.</p>
      <p>Just before 12 noon on Saturday, some thugs believed to be working for the PDP sold ballot box and <b><a href="https://t.co/ozzEUMCNgY">disrupted</a></b> the voting process at polling units 1 and 2, ward  2, Ekeki Yenogoa local government area of Bayelsa state.</p>
      <p>Similar allegation has been reported against the opposition party, APC in the state.</p>
