      <p>A woman with Kenyan roots was on Monday found dead in the Intracoastal Waterway in St. Augustine, Florida, United States.</p>
      <p>Rose Chebii, born of a Kenyan father and American mother, is thought to have drowned with preliminary reports showing no indications of foul play.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Office Chuck Mulligan said authorities are still trying to determine whether Chebii had gone for swimming or whether she died of hypothermia.</p>
      <p>The deceased was last seen walking in the downtown area at around 5:35am and her lifeless body discovered later on at around 8:30am.</p>
      <p>The pharmacy certificate graduate has been described as a “warm, friendly and bubbly personality.”</p>
      <p>Her family has set up a GoFundMe page in which they are asking for donations to help bury her in Kenya.</p>
      <p>“We appreciate any amount that you are willing to contribute towards our goal of providing her with a funeral service that gives proper honor to the great spirit that she is.”</p>
