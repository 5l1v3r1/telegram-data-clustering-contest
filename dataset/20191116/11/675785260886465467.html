      <h2>Katie Sturino received hurtful comments about her weight after nasty trolls started commenting on the body-positive advocate's Instagram account</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:26:17+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author">Kara O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>A plus-size influencer and body-positive advocate has faced harsh criticism after recreating some of Meghan Markle's latest looks.</p>
      <p>Katie Sturino, who says she is a US size 18 (UK size 20), posted a number of photos on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> with her own interpretation of Meghan's style.</p>
      <p>But while Katie received countless supportive comments about her looks, there was plenty of nasty ones too.</p>
      <p>Posting a picture of herself in a nude, belted trench dress, Katie included a message from a troll, that read: "She looks like she ate <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> ... and stole her dress."</p>
      <p>And you only need to scroll through just a handful more comments on Katie's other Instagram images to find more negative opinions.</p>
      <p>Another person wrote: "Sorry, but accepting your body that is completely unhealthy is in no way positive."</p>

      <p>Reacting to the comment, Katie wrote: "Every time I think we have made so much progress about our bodies and the way we talk about women, something pops up to remind me our work is not done!!!</p>
      <p>"My #SuperSizeTheLook shots with Meghan Markle got picked up and the comments are brutal...</p>
      <p>"They do not hurt my feelings, but they are scary. It's scary that a woman who is almost the average size in this country would be regarded with such shock!</p>

      <p>"Also, they don't stop at my body, they are equal opportunity women haters who take shots at MM aswell.</p>
      <p>"Can't be thin. Can't be fat.</p>
      <p>"Maybe STFU ABOUT WOMEN'S BODIES!!!</p>
      <p>"All this to say, please keep spreading positivity.</p>

      <p>"Please keep shining bright."</p>
      <p>She added: "Please don't engage with the crazies in the comments. Please do look at yourself in the mirror and tell her that you love her!!!!! (I just did).</p>
      <p>"Nobody deserves to be spoken to like this, on or offline. We have work to do!!!!"</p>

      <p>Writing about her project recently, Katie said: "This is never about who wore it better.</p>
      <p>"It's about empowering women of all sizes to wear what inspires them."</p>
