      <h1>Alan Hutton confident Mauricio Pochettino can revive stuttering Tottenham</h1>

      <p>Alan Hutton believes Mauricio Pochettino is the right man to continue as Tottenham manager and has predicted he could “make something special” if he continues at the North London club.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian boss has made a colossal impact since his arrival at Spurs in 2014 and has turned them into top four regulars in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>But his team have dropped off massively this campaign and there were signs of decline before his team reached the Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>They currently sit 14th in the league table during the international break and are 11 points adrift of the top four spots already.</p>
      <p>Spurs travel to West Ham when they return to action and the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/exclusive-time-running-pochettinos-tottenham-reign/">Telegraph</a> reports that it could be a pivotal game for Pochettino to save his position.</p>
      <p>Ex-Spurs defender Hutton feels that his former club should put faith in the current manager and is confident he can turn it around.</p>
      <p>“I think if you give Pochettino time he can turn it around. There has been a lot of circumstances out of his control at the start of the season with players and contracts,” <a href="https://twitter.com/5liveSport/status/1195446177577107456">Hutton told BBC Radio 5 Live Sport.</a></p>
      <p>“I think if he can sort that out in the next few transfer windows he can make something special there.”</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first Spurs team that Pochettino has built appears to have come to the end of its cycle and it looks like he needs to build a new-look side if they are to get back to challenging among the best in the division.</p>
      <p>Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen all look likely to exit eventually with their contracts close to expiring, while they have also lost key players like Kieran Trippier and Mousa Dembele in recent years.</p>
      <p>Pochettino definitely has the quality to go again with Spurs and some more fresh faces to the squad will help with that.</p>
      <p>The likes of Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon are great fresh blood, but they need more to help build a new identity.</p>
