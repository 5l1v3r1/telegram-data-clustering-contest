      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:50:28+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser N Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-n-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Police in East Kilbride have released CCTV images of two men they want to question over the assault of a veteran on Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>The East Kilbride News told you earlier this week how Christopher Smith required hospital treatment after he was beaten up by two men around 11pm last weekend.</p>
      <p>Now police have stepped up their search for those responsible.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Lex Baillie told the News: “This has been a serious act of violence that has left the victim with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>“As part of our ongoing inquiries we’re eager to identify and trace the men pictured and would ask anyone who can help us to get in touch as soon as possible.”</p>

      <p>The 61-year-old victim of the assault told the News how how he ‘feared for his life’ during the vicious attack.</p>
      <p>And, shockingly, Christopher, from the Calderwood area, is adamant that one of his attackers is a fellow veteran spotting medals on one of the assailants.</p>
      <p>Christopher, who served with the Royal Marines during the height of the troubles in Northern Ireland, has been left with a bleed on the brain, cracked ribs and bruised kidneys after the attack on Sunday just after 11pm on Stuart Street in the Village.</p>

      <p>The veteran is still recovering from a major heart attack earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He had spent the day paying his respects to the fallen and friends who didn’t make it home and was heading home after a couple of drinks when two men in their 30s approached him out of the blue.</p>
      <p>“I have no idea who they were, I have never met them in my life before,” he told the News.</p>
      <p>“One of them said something but he was so out of it and I couldn’t understand him.  I just said to them to go away and leave me alone. I didn’t want any trouble.</p>

      <p>“The guy who was wearing an Afghanistan medal said something about his friend dying over there, I said I had lost friends everywhere and the next thing I know I am being battered and face down on the ground.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t understand why this happened to me, I didn’t do anyhing. It’s horrific, especially as was of them was another veteran.”</p>
