      <p>On this day, November 16, we celebrate the International Tolerance Day.</p>
      <p>In 1996, the <b>UN General Assembly</b> called on Member States to honour the date of the Day of Tolerance by spreading the idea of ​​understanding among peoples through activities. <br/>On this date in 1995, the <b>UNESCO</b> Member States adopted the Declaration of Principles of Tolerance.</p>
      <p>In 1995, to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance and the 125th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, <b>UNESCO</b> created a prize for the promotion of tolerance and non-violence. The UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence rewards significant activities in the scientific, artistic, cultural or communication fields aimed at the promotion of a spirit of tolerance and non-violence.</p>
