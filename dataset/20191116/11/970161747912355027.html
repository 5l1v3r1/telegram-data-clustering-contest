      <p>The crisis in Bolivia shows no signs of easing after at least five supporters of former president Evo Morales were shot dead yesterday.</p>
      <p>The violence erupted in the central town of Sacaba where most of the dead and injured suffered bullet wounds.</p>
      <p>Guadalberto Lara, director of the town’s Mexico Hospital, said the violence was the worst he had seen in his 30 year career.</p>
      <p>The killings are a blow to the country’s interim government who are trying to restore order to the country after Mr Morales resigned on November 12.</p>
      <p>Morales, who has been granted asylum in Mexico, said the action was a massacre and labelled interim president Jeanine Anez’s government a dictatorship.</p>

      <p>Morales resigned after national protests over suspected vote-rigging following the presidential election on October 20 when he claimed to have won a fourth term in office.</p>
      <p>Before yesterday’s deaths, President Anez said the former leader, who denies wrongdoing, could be charged with electoral fraud if he returns home.</p>
      <p>She reiterated he would be barred from standing in fresh elections.</p>

      <p>As the families of victims held a candlelight vigil late last night in Sacaba, the country’s Ombudsman’s Office said it regretted the deaths and urged the government to investigate whether the security forces had acted legally</p>
      <p>Presidency Minister Jerjes Justiniano said five people had been killed and an estimated 22 people injured, but Mr Lara put the number injured at 75.</p>
      <p>Morales said he left the country on advice from the head of the army, but the claim was dismissed by Anez, who declared herself president after all other successors had resigned.</p>
      <p>At a news conference she said: ‘Evo Morales went on his own; nobody kicked him out. He knows he has accounts pending with justice. He can return but he has to answer to justice for electoral fraud.’</p>
