      <p>One Everton legend has sent a message of patience to fans after what has been a disappointing start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>The Blues currently find themselves 15th in the Premier League table despite an improved run of form since the last international break, winning three of the last five matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Struggles at the beginning of this term left <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> teetering above the relegation zone at one stage, with pressure rising around <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/marco-silva">Marco Silva's</a> long-term future at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>But, the last few weeks seem to have turned that around somewhat, and the Blues will return from the current break looking for their first back-to-back victories of the campaign when they play Norwich at home next weekend.</p>
      <p>And club legend Graeme Sharp thinks things could be looking up if Everton can secure all three points against the Canaries.</p>
      <p>Despite what has been a difficult start, the former striker has urged supporters to show patience as Silva looks to continue an upward trend for his side.</p>
      <p>"Listen, you never like looking at the league and seeing Everton down near the bottom," Sharp told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a>.</p>
      <p>"But it's so tight now that if we win our next home game against Norwich, you never know. We could move up to eighth or ninth.</p>
      <p>"We've just got to be patient. And I know football fans aren't patient at the moment and they want instant success, and quite rightly so. Managers get judged on results, we all know that.</p>
      <p>"I just think we've been in a situation over the last few years where we've changed too much, and we haven't had time to be stable.</p>
      <p>"We, as a group of supporters, have got to be patient. Football changes like that.</p>
      <p>"It's not nice when you're down there, but you look ahead of you and you've got to think we can get up there now.</p>
      <p>"It's not all doom and gloom."</p>
