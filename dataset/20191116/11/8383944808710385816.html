      <h1>Germany arrests Daesh terrorist deported by Turkey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:50:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">ANADOLU AGENCY</a></address>
      <p>German authorities have detained a Daesh suspect who returned to the country on Friday on suspicion of terrorism offenses, the Federal Prosecutor's office has announced.</p>
      <p>Nasim A., 21, one of two female foreign fighters deported by Turkey on Friday, was accused of being terrorist group membership, violating gun laws, and committing war crimes.</p>
      <p>The German woman is believed to have traveled to Syria in 2014 and later moved to Iraq with her husband, who was also a member of the terrorist group Daesh.</p>
      <p>Heida R., the second Daesh suspect deported by Turkey on Friday, was released after German police took her fingerprints and DNA samples.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, more than 1,050 foreign fighters traveled from Germany to conflict areas in Syria and Iraq, according to German security agencies.</p>
      <p>Last week Turkey started to deport foreign fighters it captured in anti-terror operations at home and abroad to their countries of origin.</p>
      <p>The issue of the handling of Daesh members and their families detained in Syria -- including foreign members of the terror group -- has been controversial, with Turkey arguing foreign-born terrorists should be repatriated to their countries of origin.</p>
      <p>While criticizing some European countries for resisting repatriation, it recently praised Germany's steps to take back suspected Daesh members.</p>
