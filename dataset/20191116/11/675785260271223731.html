      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:08:32+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, Oliver Milne, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Labour's 2019 election manifesto will be confirmed today after Jeremy Corbyn arrived to face a showdown with scores of party chiefs.</p>
      <p>The "transformative" document is set to promise nationalised mail, rail, water, energy and broadband, free NHS prescriptions and six years' free adult education in England, and a £10 minimum wage for all over 16.</p>
      <p>But unions and some of Labour's front bench were still split over key issues - including immigration - as the party prepared to kick off its 'Clause V' meeting at noon today.</p>
      <p>Today's meeting was shrouded in secrecy as attendees had their phones confiscated to prevent leaks and were told to use one emergency phone guarded by a Labour staffer.</p>
      <p>One source suggested shadow cabinet ministers had not even seen final drafts of their own sections.</p>
      <p>Unlike the Tory manifesto Labour's is agreed by the shadow cabinet, ruling NEC, PLP committee, Scottish and Welsh leaders and union reps in a mammoth meeting before election day.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn arrived to protesters chanting " <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> party hear us say - free movement here to stay" at 10.30am in central London.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking hours after unveiling a £20bn pledge for free broadband he boasted: "It’s going to be a document that will be transformative of the lives of people al over this country.”</p>
      <p>But sources said there were still deep splits over how far to allow freedom of movement after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>Labour's Party conference last month <a href="https://labourlist.org/2019/09/labour-conference-approves-motion-to-extend-free-movement/">passed a radical motion</a> to "maintain and extend free movement rights", "ensure unconditional right to family reunion" and "reject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps/targets".</p>
      <p>But party chiefs have repeatedly indicated the policy - which the Tories falsely claim is axing all immigration controls - will not pass into the manifesto intact.</p>
      <p>Frontbench splits emerged this week when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/diane-abbott">Diane Abbott</a> said Labour was committed to maintaining and extending free movement rights - only for sources to stress she was talking about EU citizens.</p>

      <p>A union source told the Mirror unions were also split, with Unite and the CWU pushing for a firmer line including protections for workers' rights while the TSSA and Unison wanted a more open policy.</p>
      <p>Unite general secretary Len McCluskey spoke to a protester as he arrived saying: "We support the protection of migrant workers and every other worker as well."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile a union source said there was a "bust-up" over Labour's Green New Deal - which would back getting the UK to net zero carbon emissions by 2030.</p>
      <p>The source said the GMB union, which represents many workers in heavy industry, was refusing to sign off the policy and even threatening to come out publicly against it.</p>
      <p>The Mirror understands the Clause V meeting opens with an introduction by NEC chair Andi Fox followed by a presentation on the "political context" from Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The manifesto will then be introduced one section at a time - including on the economy, NHS, education, police, migration, housing and a second referendum on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Changes to the text can only be made if there is a consensus including Mr Corbyn and the relevant member of the shadow cabinet. If that consensus doesn't exist, the issue can be pushed to a vote.</p>

      <p>Details will not be released officially tonight with the launch only due on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the meeting, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said Labour "needs to do a sensible deal with Europe that would allow change to the way we manage migration."</p>
      <p>He added: "One of the reasons I think people voted in the way that they did was a sense of unfairness between the way people coming from Europe are treated but people from India or Pakistan or other countries get a differential treatment.</p>
      <p>"So I think this is an opportunity to get fairness into the immigration system so that it deals with people on the same level wherever they come from.</p>
      <p>"And I do believe the public were asking for a reform of that kind."</p>

      <p>But any reforms would depend on Labour either winning an overall majority against the odds or forming a coalition.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem Sir Vince Cable today said his party were "absolutely clear we couldn't possibly allow" Jeremy Corbyn into 10 Downing Street through a coalition or pact.</p>
      <p>He claimed: "The idea of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> winning and becoming Prime Minister, one in a million. It's not going to happen."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn told us this week: "I never comment on opinion polls, I only comment on the prospects of success, and they are very very good."</p>
