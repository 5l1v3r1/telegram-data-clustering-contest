      <h1>Sunday Playbook: Look for a quarterback show in Texans vs. Ravens</h1>

      <p>There was a time in the 1970s when it seemed the majority of exciting quarterbacks in the National Football League played in the American Conference. Dan Fouts, Bert Jones, Ken Anderson, Terry Bradshaw and Ken Stabler were the big names. Dan Pastorini, Jim Plunkett, Joe Ferguson, Bob Griese, Brian Sipe, no slouches, were some of the lesser lights.</p>
      <p>Then came Dan Marino, John Elway and Jim Kelly in the '80s.</p>
      <p>It can be argued that most of the exciting and talented young QBs again reside in the AFC. A good example is Sunday's first NFL matchup of Deshaun Watson of the Houston Texans and Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens, which promises to be a classic rivalry for the next decade or so. Add in another AFC thrill show, Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs, and the possibility that Josh Allen, Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold rise in Year 3, and Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa star as rookies next year, and you have a ton of talent and entertainment value.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, the AFC is embarrassingly weak this season, but that could change quickly with better quarterback play.</p>
      <p>The Houston-Baltimore game is more than a showcase for multitalented quarterbacks. It will be a key game in the AFC playoff picture, matching two division leaders and candidates for first-round playoff byes and the most likely challenger to New England's reign in the conference.</p>
      <p>The Texans-Ravens clash tops the Week 11 schedule. A capsule look at the lineup:</p>
      <h3>Game of the day</h3>
      <p><b>Texans (6-3) at Ravens (7-2)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Ravens (-4½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Texans 4-5; Ravens 5-4.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 50.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Texans 3/6; Ravens 6/3.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Watson and the Clemson Tigers and Jackson and the Louisville Cardinals met on Oct. 1, 2016, and the two teams put on a spectacular show. Watson passed for two touchdowns in the last 7:05 to bring Clemson back for a 42-36 victory to keep the Tigers on the road to the national championship. Watson completed 20 of 31 passes (with three INTs) for 306 yards and carried 14 times for 92 yards and a 6.5 average. Jackson completed 27 of 44 for 295 yards but only one touchdown. He did carry 31 times for 201 yards (5.2 average) and two scoring runs, including an 11-yarder that put the Cards into the lead, 36-28. ... The Ravens come in on a five-game win streak since their home loss to the Browns. Houston had a bye last week but has won four of their last five games with the loss to the Colts (30-23).<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Jackson is a unique talent, but the Ravens are a solid team that leads the league in rushing at 197.2 yards per game and can beat you with good old meat-and-potatoes football. Ravens, 27-20.</p>
      <h3>Top attractions</h3>
      <p><b>Patriots (8-1) at Eagles (5-4)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 4:25 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Patriots (-3½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Patriots 6-3; Eagles 5-4.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 44½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Patriots 6/3; Eagles 5/4.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Last time these teams met was in Super Bowl LII, won by the Eagles, 41-33; however Nick Foles – not the injured Carson Wentz – was the Eagles' QB that day. In the loss, Tom Brady passed for a Super Bowl record 505 yards, three TDs and a 115.4 rating. ... Last time teams met in regular season was in 2015, when Malcolm Jenkins of the Eagles took a Brady pass back 99 yards for a touchdown. It turned out to be go-ahead score in 35-28 Eagles win.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> First time they were tested by a really strong team, the Patriots lost. Eagles are strong and getting better. Eagles, 31-28.<br/><b>Chiefs (6-4) at Chargers (4-6)</b><br/><b>TV:</b> ESPN, 8:15 p.m. Monday.<br/><b>The line:</b> Chiefs (-3½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Chiefs 4-6; Chargers 3-7.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 52.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Chiefs 6/4; Chargers 2/8.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> It's a Chargers home game at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. How did the Chargers agree to play an important division game at a neutral site? ... Chiefs blew a 10-0 lead and lost to Titans on the road, 35-32, last week. KC's four losses in last five games and Oakland's two-game win streak have made this a vital game for Chiefs. It's also a do or die for Chargers if they have any remaining hopes of winning AFC West. Chiefs have lost last three games Mahomes has started, even though he's been as productive as ever. ... It will be fun watching Chargers pass rusher Joey Bosa chase Mahomes all night. The Bosa brothers, Joey and Nick of the 49ers, have 15.5 sacks between them.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Colts in OT and win over Packers, both at home, are only plus games on Chargers' record. Bolts are classic underachievers who will be demoralized by Mahomes and KC's speed. Chiefs, 31-23.<br/><b>Saints (7-2) at Buccaneers (3-6)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Saints (5½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Saints 6-3; Bucs 2-7.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 50.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Saints 5/4; Bucs 8/1.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Bucs are no threat to Saints' lead in NFC South, but Tampa Bay games are fun offensive shows. Bucs have gone over in eight of their nine games and the number is usually 50 or more. Tampa Bay averaging 28.9 points per game despite record. Only 49ers in opener (17) have held Bucs under 20 points.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Some media were eager to crown Saints as latest version of 1985 Bears. Then came totally unexpected home loss to Falcons last week. Can't see Bucs running wild against solid New Orleans defense. Saints, 27-20.<br/><b>Jaguars (4-5) at Colts (5-4)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Colts (-3).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Jaguars 5-4; Colts 5-4.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 43½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Jaguars 4/5; Colts 5/4.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Jaguars had bye last week to get ready for key division game. You know what they say happens when you give Doug Marrone an extra week to prepare for an opponent? Oh, well. ... Colts were in good shape until QB Jacoby Brissett was injured two weeks ago in loss at Steelers. Then came loss at home to Dolphins. Brissett is expected to be back for this one to face Jags, who get QB Nick Foles back from broken collarbone suffered in opener. This one could be decided by running backs, Leonard Fournette of Jags (831 rushing yards) and Marlon Mack of Colts (753).<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Jags put on terrible show in London in loss to Texans and Colts lost home game to Miami, which says it all. Loser here can kiss division hopes goodbye. Jaguars, 19-17.</p>
      <h3>Best of the rest</h3>
      <p><b>Bills (6-3) at Dolphins (2-7)</b><br/><b>TV:</b> CBS, 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Bills (-6½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Bills 5-4; Dolphins 5-4.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 40½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Bills 2/7; Dolphins 3/6.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Over/under in this one should be 33 if you go by scoring averages of these two offenses. Think about it: Needing field goal instead of touchdown in loss at Browns last week might have caused Bills to play for long field goal and late tie instead of being aggressive and going for it on fourth-and-4 at Browns' 35 ... Bills have become a shaky favorite even against a team that is tanking. ... Brian Flores of Dolphins is proving he can coach and lead.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Fans and media can't decide who the scapegoat is for Bills' losses to Eagles and Browns, two teams on upswing. Look for another struggle against Fitz and Fish. Bills, 17-13.<br/><b>Falcons (2-7) at Panthers (5-4)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Panthers (-5½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Falcons 3-6; Panthers 5-4.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 49½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Falcons 4/5; Panthers 6/3.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Almost out of nowhere, the Falcons came up with a shutout performance to upset division rival Saints on the road last week. ... With Matt Ryan and receivers Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley and Austin Hooper, Falcons should score more than 21.2 per game, but they don't.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Surprising that Falcons haven't quit on coach Dan Quinn, whom they have to believe will be fired at end of season. Panthers have gotten more than they had any right to expect out of backup QB Kyle Allen. Falcons, 28-24.<br/><b>Cowboys (5-4) at Lions (3-5-1)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Cowboys (-3).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Cowboys 5-4; Lions 4-5.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 51½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Cowboys 6/3; Lions 6/3.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Despite all their success over the years and Lions' failure, Cowboys only have a 14-11 lead (plus 2-1 postseason) over Detroit in all-time series. ... Even Dallas media noting that Cowboys faced Saints without Drew Brees, Packers without Davante Adams and the Vikings without Adam Thielen and lost them all. ... Lions QB Matthew Stafford practiced this week even with fracture in his back.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Only one of five Dallas victories has come against a team with a winning record (Eagles). Lions are 3-5-1 and may have to start Jeff Driskel at QB. Dallas usually bounces back after a dud performance. Cowboys, 34-24.<br/><b>Broncos (3-6) at Vikings (7-3)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Vikings (-10½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Broncos 5-4; Vikings 6-4.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 40½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Broncos 2/7; Vikings 5/5.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Denver had bye last week after win over Browns. Vikings have won four of their last five with the loss on late field goal at Chiefs. ... Brandon Allen makes second start for Broncos at quarterback. ... Dalvin Cook of Vikings leads league with 991 rushing yards after he ran for 97 in win at Dallas last week. Also had 86 receiving yards. ... Broncos have won last three times franchises have met.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Denver can't match up with Vikes with Allen at quarterback, but defense is good enough to stay inside the spread. Vikings 20-14.<br/><b>Cardinals (3-6-1) at 49ers (8-1)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 4:05 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> 49ers (-11½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Cardinals 6-4; 49ers 3-6.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 45.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Cardinals 5/5; 49ers 5/4.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Niners almost blew big lead before defeating Arizona, 28-25, on Oct. 31. It was San Francisco's first win over Cards since 2014 when Colin Kaepernick passed for two touchdowns, including the winner.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Being able to squeeze three wins and a tie out of Cards with a rookie quarterback says something about coaching job Kliff Kingsbury is doing. Besides the Cards are interesting to watch. Niners, 27-25.<br/><b>Bengals (0-9) at Raiders (5-4)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 4:25 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Raiders (-10½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Bengals 3-6; Raiders 6-3.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 48½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Bengals 3/6; Raiders 5/4.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> If Raiders defeat hapless Bengals and their rookie QB Ryan Finley and Chiefs should on Monday night in Mexico City, guess who will take over first place in AFC West? Wasn't the AFC West supposedly decided seven weeks ago? ... Nobody's laughing at Jon Gruden anymore. He has straightened out QB Derek Carr and making good use of running back Josh Jacobs, who has run for 811 yards and seven touchdowns. Carr has 95-plus passer rating for last seven weeks.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Hard to believe Bengals are as bad as they are some weeks. Turning to rookie Ryan Finley at QB, who is not ready, is a tank job. Raiders starting to believe. Raiders, 34-20.<br/><b>Bears (4-5) at Rams (5-4)</b><br/><b>TV:</b> NBC, 8:20 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Rams (-6½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Bears 3-6; Rams 5-4.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 40½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Bears 2/7; Rams 4/5.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Strangely, can't think of a memorable game between these old-line NFC teams. They have met only twice in postseason, 1950 and 1985 when immortal Dieter Brock was L.A. quarterback, backed up by Steve Dills and Jeff Kemp, Jack's son. ... After impressive start with wins against Panthers, Saints and at Browns, Rams are 2-4 with wins over 2-7 Falcons and 0-9 Bengals. Thought Sean McVay was supposed to be some kind of coaching genius. ... Much-maligned Mitch Trubisky of Bears (three TDs, no INTs) outperformed Rams' Jared Goff (no TDs, two INTs) in games last week.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Two of most disappointing teams in NFL. Rams were in Super Bowl a year ago and now they're a bubble team. Bears averaging only 18 points and 262 yards per game. Bills are better than those numbers. Bears are 2-2 on road but against wins were over Denver and Washington. Rams, 24-16.</p>
      <h3>Dog of the day</h3>
      <p><b>Jets (2-7) at Redskins (1-8)</b><br/><b>Kickoff:</b> 1 p.m.<br/><b>The line:</b> Redskins (1½).<br/><b>Record ATS:</b> Jets 2-7; Redskins 3-6.<br/><b>Over/under:</b> 38½.<br/><b>Times over/under:</b> Jets 4/5; Redskins 3/6.<br/><b>The scoop:</b> Easily the least attractive game on the schedule. Redskins have committed to Dwayne Haskins Jr. as their starter at QB for rest of season. He could get schooled by Sam Darnold and the Jets. Darnold had an efficient game in win over Giants that ended Gang Green's three-game losing streak. Both Jets wins over NFC East this season, including shocker over Cowboys.<br/><b>Outlook:</b> Jets love NFC East. Jets, 27-14.<br/><i>Last week: Favorites were 5-8 straight up, 5-8 against the spread. Road favorites were 1-3 and 1-3 ATS. Seven games went over the number, six were under.</i><br/><i>Last week's results: 6-6 straight up; 6-6 ATS.</i><br/><i>Season's record: 79-58-1 straight up; 62-76 ATS.</i></p>
