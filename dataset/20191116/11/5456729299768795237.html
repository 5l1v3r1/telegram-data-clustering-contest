      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:19:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/363451-just-in-inec-cancels-election-in-bayelsa-community-over-violence.html" target="_blank">Taiwo-Hassan Adebayo</a></address>
      <p>Voting has been cancelled in Ologi (Ward 03) of Ogbia Local Government Area (LGA), a senior electoral official has said, following a violent incident that included “seizing” of an electoral official.</p>
      <p>The official, Ukuachukwu Orji, who is the INEC supervisory resident electoral commissioner for Ogbia LGA, said members of the Ologi community forcibly prevented election in the riverine area.</p>
      <p>“As our people (electoral officers) were coming into the community after crossing the river, they seized them and the materials and burnt all the materials.”</p>
      <p>“They chased our people away and seized some but the military rescued them.”</p>
      <p>Mr Orji, who is originally the REC for Anambra State, spoke in Otuoke (Ward 13 of Ogbia LGA) where President Goodluck Jonathan and his family voted.</p>
      <p>He said election in the community was then cancelled as a consequence of the violence.</p>
      <p>He expressed satisfaction that election has been smooth in other communities that form the LGA, except in Ologi.</p>
      <p>The governorship election in Bayelsa State is being held in all the eight local government areas of the state.</p>
