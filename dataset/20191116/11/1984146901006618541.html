      <h2>From Ayoze Perez to Salomon Rondon with a bit of Joselu too - here's how Newcastle's ex-players are settling at their new clubs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:49:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United’s squad went through a big overhaul during the summer.</p>
      <p>Manager <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Rafa Benitez</a> left the club and Steve Bruce made five signings of his own but <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> also shipped out a lot of players to cater for the new boys.</p>
      <p>In total, eight senior players left the club on a permanent basis to start afresh in pastures new.</p>
      <p>But how have they started at their new clubs? With the 2019/20 season almost a third of the way through, we assess how Newcastle's 'exiteers' have fared.</p>
      <h3>Ayoze Perez </h3>
      <p>Perez joined Leicester in a £30million deal following a brilliant end to the 2019/20 campaign.</p>
      <p>In his five years at Newcastle, Perez scored 48 goals in 195 appearances and under Rafa Benitez he had developed into a very good Premier League forward.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has not been shy in voicing his ambition to be called up to the Spain squad and after the Foxes came calling in the summer, he felt it was the right time to move on from Tyneside.</p>
      <p>Perez scored 11 goals in 2019 for Newcastle but in nine appearances for Brendan Rodgers' side he is yet to find the net.</p>
      <p>Used on the right-hand side of a front three, Perez started the opening four games of the season but then found himself playing second fiddle to Harvey Barnes.</p>
      <p>However, he has since regained his place in the side and repaid Brendan Rodgers' faith with a hat-trick away at Southampton last month, as the Foxes ran out 9-0 winners.</p>
      <p>Leicester currently sit second in the Premier League table and Perez has contributed three goals and two assists to their cause.</p>

      <h3>Mo Diame</h3>
      <p>Diame's contract was not renewed in the summer despite a successful three-year stay at Newcastle.</p>
      <p>The Senegal international midfielder was one of Benitez's most trusted lieutenants but wanted a two-year extension when Newcastle were only willing to offer him a one-year deal.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old had spent 10 years in England across spells with Wigan, West Ham, Hull and the Magpies and he took the decision to move to Qatar to join Al Ahli.</p>
      <p>The Qatari season is only six games old but Diame has been an ever-present with Al Ahli sitting seventh in the Qatar Stars League.</p>
      <p>Diame has been used as one of two holding midfielders and is playing alongside former Premier League players Abel Hernandez, Nabil El-Zhar and Shane Lowry, as well as Paraguay international Hernan Perez.</p>

      <h3>Salomon Rondon</h3>
      <p>Newcastle were keen to sign Rondon on a permanent basis while Benitez was in charge but given the club's policy of only signing players for substantial fees when they are under 26 years of age, that was never a possibility once the Spaniard left.</p>
      <p>Instead, Benitez signed the 30-year-old for his new side Dalian Yifang and hoped he could replicate the goalscoring form that saw him score 12 goals during a season-long loan spell with the Magpies.</p>
      <p>The Venezuelan international has made a fairly successful start to life in China, scoring three goals and registering two assists in eight appearances.</p>
      <p>Dalian Yifang currently sit ninth in the Chinese Super League table, while they also reached - and were subsequently beaten in - the Chinese FA Cup semi-finals.</p>

      <h3>Joselu</h3>
      <p>Joselu's effort levels during his two years at Newcastle could never be questioned. The truth was he just wasn't quite good enough to lead the line of a Premier League team.</p>
      <p>He has now returned to Spain with Alaves and he enjoyed a very good start to the season. A debut goal against Levante was backed up by a scrappy goal against Getafe took his tally to two goals in the opening three matches of the season.</p>
      <p>His goalscoring rate has slowed down somewhat since then but he did nab a third goal of the campaign in a 2-0 win over Real Mallorca last month, as well as a goal against Real Valladolid.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old now has four goals in seven appearances this term.</p>

      <h3>Kenedy</h3>
      <p>Kenedy's first loan spell at Newcastle was electric and there was talk of the move being made permanent.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian rejoined on loan from Chelsea last season and there was much hope that the Brazilian could help Newcastle kick on.</p>
      <p>A penalty miss in stoppage time against Cardiff in August set the tone for a miserable season on the pitch that was compounded by private, off-field issues.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the move was not made permanent but he was given a number of opportunities to impress new Chelsea boss Frank Lampard during pre-season.</p>
      <p>In the end, though, he joined La Liga side Getafe on a season-long loan deal. The 23-year-old has started three of Getafe's four Europa League group games but had struggled to get into the starting side in La Liga.</p>
      <p>However, he finally got his first league start in November and he capped it by scoring the winning goal against Celta Vigo.</p>
      <p>Kenedy has one goal and three assists so far this season, with Getafe sitting seventh in the La Liga table and second in their European League group.</p>

      <h3>Antonio Barreca</h3>
      <p>Barreca joined Newcastle on loan in January but managed just one four-minute cameo from the bench against Tottenham.</p>
      <p>He joined back up with Monaco in the summer before returning to Italy to join Genoa on a season-long loan deal in a bid to rediscover his best form.</p>
      <p>Despite being used as a left-back for the majority of his career, Barreca started five of Genoa's opening six games as a left-winger.</p>
      <p>The former Italy under-21 star suffered a calf injury in a 4-0 defeat to Lazio, though, and that has since restricted him to just 26 minutes of football across the last six Serie A games.</p>

      <h3>Callum Roberts</h3>
      <p>Roberts started the year by scoring his first senior goal in a 4-2 FA Cup win over Blackburn. An unsuccessful loan spell with Colchester was followed by his release from Newcastle just months later.</p>
      <p>Greek giants Panathinaikos were keen to sign him on a free transfer but Roberts made the decision to stay in the North East to join National League North side Blyth Spartans.</p>
      <p>The Newcastle academy graduate has been a regular starter under Lee Clark and has enjoyed a phenomenal start to the season.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has scored 10 goals in 12 games and should he keep it up, a move further up the football pyramid will surely follow next season.</p>

      <h3>Josef Yarney</h3>
      <p>Yarney was involved with the first-team during pre-season last summer but was released this summer following loan spells with Morecambe and Chesterfield last term.</p>
      <p>The young defender has since joined Chesterfield on a permanent basis and has featured in 18 of the Spireites' 19 league games this season, scoring one goal.</p>
