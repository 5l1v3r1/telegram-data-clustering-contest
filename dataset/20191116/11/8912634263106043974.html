      <p>BEIRUT: A majestic phoenix spreads its wings as Hayat Nazer adds a splash of color to a Beirut wall. As Lebanon’s uprising enters its second month, graffiti has enveloped the capital’s posh downtown.<br/>Since October 17, the chanting of tens of thousands of Lebanese denouncing the political elite have shaken the normally staid district around two Beirut squares — Martyrs’ and Riad Al-Solh.<br/>Nazer, a 32-year-old artist, is one of the protesters who would not normally frequent the area, famed for luxury boutiques and elegant buildings. But the unprecedented protests also offered her a first experience with street art.<br/>“I decided to go out in the street to be inspired by the people,” she said during a cigarette break, standing next to pots of red, green and yellow paint.<br/>Then she turned to place the final brushstroke on the mythical bird emerging from a burning forest — a reference to the fires that ravaged Lebanon’s mountains shortly before the protests began.<br/>“The phoenix reminds us that the Lebanese shouldn’t lose hope. When we fall, we need to rise up and fly to freedom, to claim our rights,” she said.<br/>The long concrete barrier Nazer was painting protects a United Nations building, but has been named the “wall of the revolution” for the graffiti adorning it.<br/>A ballerina pirouettes under shells, accompanied by the slogan “Rise up.” Further down, a big purple hand flashes a V for victory.<br/>On nearby buildings, various causes are championed with spray-painted and stenciled slogans: “Our revolution is feminist”; “LGBT rights, love is not a crime“; and “We will burn your palaces.”<br/>Political leaders are lampooned in caricature, including outgoing Prime Minister Saad Hariri, longstanding parliament speaker Nabih Berri, and central bank governor Riad Salameh.<br/>The contrast is striking compared with the nearby opulence of a district that was controversially rebuilt after being ravaged during the 1975-1990 civil war.<br/>Today a Rolex clock tower stands in front of a parliament cordoned off by security forces. Working-class souks have been replaced by a modern commercial center, home to banks and French luxury brands.<br/>The reconstruction of the district, famed for its stone buildings in neo-Venetian and neo-Moorish style, was led by Solidere, the real estate company of billionaire former prime minister Rafiq Hariri.<br/>Its detractors say the project killed the soul of a formerly vibrant neighborhood in order to attract Gulf investment and wealthy tourists.<br/>“This city has become an icon of capitalism,” said artist and rights activist Selim Mawad.<br/>He jumped onto a plastic barricade to retouch a mural of stylized bulls alongside the slogan: “What is the future of our revolution?”<br/>Lebanon’s uprising — like protests elsewhere in the Middle East and Latin America — is both political and social.<br/>“It’s also about personal liberation, which is the foundation of a revolution,” Mawad said.<br/>He sees symbolism in graffiti.<br/>“People say, ‘I can’t touch this building, I can’t live there, so I’ll leave my mark on it’,” the paint-spattered artist said.<br/>One day, assailants attacked the protesters in the area where Mawad was painting his mural. He was beaten and his bicycle stolen.<br/>“Give back the stolen money — and don’t forget the bike,” he later painted next to a picture of a bull brandishing a red bicycle.<br/>He hopes the paintings will be preserved. “It’s the memory of an uprising. If they erase them, we will forget.”<br/>Nearby, Rida Mawla left a meeting and decided to take a walk in the city center, something he said he never previously did.<br/>“I’m starting to feel like downtown is a bit more like me,” the business consultant said.<br/>“In theory it’s the place where everyone should meet, but the ruling class has taken possession of it,” he said.<br/>He pointed out his favorite graffiti, a big black tag scrawled on a wall: “Beirut has spoken.”</p>
