      <p>The 52-year-old, who has been a special for more than 15 years, was hit by a passing car while attending the scene of a separate collision on the Wolverhampton Road just after 10.30pm last Friday.</p>
      <p>The officer, from the Force Support Unit, suffered multiple fractures to his leg and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>Special Chief Officer Mike Rogers said: "I visited Resham this week and he is in good spirits.</p>
      <p>"But he is currently undergoing extensive treatment and we believe that will continue for some time.</p>
      <p>"This incident does clearly illustrate the risks we, and all the policing family, face in our role of protecting the public we serve.</p>
      <p>"Our thoughts and best wishes go to him and his family who are helping support him in his recovery."</p>
      <h3>Arrested</h3>
      <p>The 59-year-old driver of the vehicle was arrested at the scene on suspicion of dangerous driving. She has been released under investigation while inquiries continue.</p>
      <p>It is the latest incident where a West Midlands Police officer has been injured recently.</p>
      <p>In September an officer was injured in a hit-and-run in Coventry and in August Pc Gareth Phillips was badly injured when he was run over by a hijacked police car in Birmingham.</p>
