      <p>A violent bully tried to hurl his pregnant girlfriend out of a first-floor window after he noticed a man “liked” her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> photo.</p>
      <p>Ashley Brazier picked up his 7st 2lbs partner and tried to chuck her out of the window, after throwing away her recently deceased father's ashes.</p>
      <p>The victim only managed to prevent the fall by extending her body across the window frame in the second of two vicious rages.</p>
      <p>Brazier, 31, of Whitstable, Kent, struck her in the face with her phone after accusing her of having an affair.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Amy Nicholson said Brazier’s anger intensified after his attempt to hurl the victim out of the window failed.</p>
      <p>He then pinned her to the wall by the throat and lifted her off the floor to set up his next attack before a “petrifying” game of cat-and-mouse ensued.</p>

      <p>Brazier repeatedly spat in his victim’s face as she fought to escape and slapped her with such force it caused ringing in her ear.</p>
      <p>Brazier delivered an uppercut to the pregnant woman’s torso, dislodging a rib and puncturing a lung - which doctors later had to inflate twice.</p>
      <p>He then stripped her and locked her out of the room, only relenting after realising the damage he had caused.</p>
      <p>She was sent to the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent, where doctors had to install a drainage tap.</p>
      <p>The victim did not know she was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time of the assault.</p>
      <p>In a previous attack, Brazier became suspicious of one of his partner’s texts while drinking at a friends’ home in Ramsgate, Kent.</p>
      <p>He called the woman "a slag", slapped her, pulled clumps of hair from her head and spat in her face in front of a seven-month-old baby in June.</p>
      <p>Miss Nicholson said the victim branded Brazier “spiteful, cruel” and told how on one occasion he “threw away her father’s ashes”.</p>
      <p>She added: “She says what happened has ruined her life.”</p>

      <p>Brazier had 41 previous convictions including two for harassment, six for battery, 10 for criminal damage as well as multiple breaches of court orders.</p>
      <p>Judge Rupert Lowe scalded Brazier for his campaign of violence and humiliating the woman with “signature attacks” of stripping her.</p>
      <p>The judge said Brazier posed a “significant risk to the public” but could not impose an extended sentence because his sentencing powers were restricted.</p>
      <p>He jailed Brazier for three years and nine months for grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm at Canterbury Crown Court on Thursday.</p>
