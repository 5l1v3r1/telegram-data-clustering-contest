      <h3>By Raymond Mordi</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The canoe that was to take The Nation’s Deputy Political Editor, Raymond Mordi, out of Sampou community, in Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government, tipped over and capsized as another reporter stepped unto it.</p>
      <p>He sustained injury on his right hand and right leg.</p>
      <p>The canoe carries a maximum of four persons but in spite of entreaties not to come in, a fifth person entered the canoe and forcefully too, forcing it to capsize.</p>
      <p>Luckily, it is still in shallow waters.</p>
      <p>“Afterwards everyone scampered for safety. We had to look for another canoe to convey us to where our vehicles were parked,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sampou is the village of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate Senator Douye Diri.</p>
      <p>Ordinarily, it is accessible by road but has been flooded, making vehicular access impossible.</p>
