      <p>Everton defender Jonjoe Kenny insists he is not thinking about his future at this moment in time and just taking things’ game by game’.</p>
      <p>The defender joined Schalke on a season-long loan deal this summer after struggling to oust Seamus Coleman in Everton’s first-team.</p>
      <p>He’s made a big impression in his short time in Germany so far, impressing fans and pundits alike as he’s established himself as first-choice in the right-back slot.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga side are keen to keep hold of him long-term, although his loan deal does not include a purchase option.</p>
      <p>Everton will be the ones to decide his fate, with them likely to wait until the end of the season and whether they decide to turn Djibril Sidibé’s loan deal into a permanent move.</p>
      <p>Until that point, Kenny is solely focused on continuing to impress at Schalke, although he was keen to express his gratitude to Everton.</p>
      <p><i>“Everton is my childhood club, and I’m very grateful to all the people there,”</i> he told <a href="https://www.ruhr24.de/s04/schalke-jonjoe-kenny-laesst-hoffen-bleibt-er-langfristig-beim-s04-13220518.html">RUHR 24.</a></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’ve been playing there since I was a little boy and I love the club, but right now I’m playing for Schalke 04, and I have a job to do here.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We’ll see what happens in the near future, right now I’m just thinking game by game.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“For my personal development, it has been a huge opportunity to come here and even off the field, I learn a lot about myself and grow as a person.”</i>
      </p>
