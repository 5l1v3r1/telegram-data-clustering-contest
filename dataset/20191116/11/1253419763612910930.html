      <p>Have you ever wondered what a modern remake of the first Halo game would look in Unreal Engine 4? Well, time to find out. Quixel’s Environment Artist, Jack McKelvie, has recreated Halo’s Blood Gulch in Unreal Engine 4.</p>
      <p>According to McKelvie, the environment went through a lot of iterations before reaching its final version. Moreover, this fan remake uses Megascans so expect really sharp textures from it.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, McKelvie did not release this project to the public. However, users can download the track’s blueprint and asset from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bVTlkp_qriicoH8GeZ8sIsCRhNqUT3fL/view">here</a>. As such, talented mappers will be able to remake this Halo fan remake (lol) in Unreal Engine 4.</p>
      <p>In order to showcase this map, Quixel released the following video. In this video, McKelvie gives us an in-depth look into the re-creation of Halo’s Blood Gulch map. Moreover, this first tutorial focuses on the natural aspects of the environment.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
