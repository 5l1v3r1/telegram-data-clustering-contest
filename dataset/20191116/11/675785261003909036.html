      <h2>Jen Costa's weight ballooned up 25stome after a car accident 14 years ago. She would regularly binge on takeaways and was a size 9Xl when she was diagnosed with tongue cancer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:31:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author">Olive Loveridge-Greene</a></address>
      <p>A morbidly obese woman said her life was saved after she lost 35 stone - when doctors were forced to cut off her TONGUE.</p>
      <p>Jen Costa, 35, piled on 25 stone over 14 years after she suffered injuries in a car crash and gorged on takeaways every day - leaving her tipping the scales at almost 650lbs.</p>
      <p>Size 9XL Jen was so large she was unable to stand up in the shower and had to have her partner wash her with a sponge as she sat on a chair.</p>
      <p>She noticed a pain in her mouth when she struggled to complete a takeaway order over the phone - and then discovered a tiny white lump on the right side of her tongue.</p>
      <p>Jen, then 46st, was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer of the tongue but was told to prepare for the worst because she was too fat for surgery and radiation.</p>
      <p>Refusing to accept death as an answer, Jen visited a dozen hospitals across New York City before a doctor agreed to help.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She underwent a 19 hour operation to remove most of her tongue and replace it with one made from a bit of her arm.</p>
      <p>It left her unable to eat solid food, and now she exists on a liquid diet, and she has lost a staggering 35 stone over two years.</p>
      <p>Jen, from New York City, said: "I was handed a death sentence and it's ending up saving my life.</p>
      <p>"What started as the darkest period of my life soon revealed itself as my biggest blessing in disguise.</p>
      <p>"I used to be addicted to food. I abused the privilege to eat.</p>
      <p>"After the car accident I was completely bed-bound and ordered a takeaway every single day.</p>
      <p>"Now I have no choice.</p>
      <p>"I can't eat anything but it's a blessing. I've lost 500lbs.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"God allowed me to battle cancer and to make me appreciate all that I took for granted in my life.</p>
      <p>"Beforehand I was obese, sad, miserable, depressed and angry.</p>
      <p>"But the cancer has made me strong and humble.</p>
      <p>"I have no taste in my mouth - it's just a lump in my mouth which is just there.</p>
      <p>"I miss pizza, I miss ordering a Chinese and I miss the taste of my Grandma's chicken.</p>
      <p>"But despite that I'm just so much happier."</p>
      <p>Jen says she had "always been a bit chubby" throughout her teenage years but was still a pretty active person.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But aged 19 Jen was hit by a car on a public highway which saw her left knee snap and ligaments torn in half, held together only by skin.</p>
      <p>She lost movement in her legs for a year and then struggled with putting weight on her leg, plunging her into a depression and making her turn to food for comfort.</p>
      <p>She also self-medicated with 'angel-dust' - PCP - for comfort, and piled on a whopping 25 stone over the course of 14 years.</p>
      <p>But in early 2015 Jen noticed she had an aching pain in her mouth.</p>
      <p>When she struggled to complete a takeaway order over the phone, she decided to visit the doctor.</p>
      <p>She said five doctors and a dentist dismissed a small white lump on the right side of her tongue as a virus, for three months.</p>

      <p>She claims she probed them to investigate it further after doing her own research online.</p>
      <p>She was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic cancer, an aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma, and told it had spread to the lymph nodes in her neck.</p>
      <p>Jen said: "I was given medication after medication and nothing was working.</p>
      <p>"I turned round one day and said 'Doc, do you think I have cancer?'"</p>
      <p>"He almost laughed it off and said 'No way! You're too young for cancer.</p>
      <p>"So I left it at that.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"But over the next few months the pain was becoming unbearable.</p>
      <p>"It was getting difficult to eat and even speak.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I was saying more than a few dozen of words a day.</p>
      <p>"That wasn't much of a life.</p>
      <p>"I decided to go and see one more doctor.</p>
      <p>"And thank God I did because that was when everything was about to change.</p>
      <p>"After a five minute examination the doctor turned round and told me 'I'm sorry to tell you this but that's definitely cancer.'"</p>
      <p>"Everything went dark. I had, what?</p>
      <p>But when she was finally diagnosed with stage four cancer by her sixth doctor, Jen was initially told she was too fat to operate on and was told to prepare for the worse.</p>
      <p>She said: "He told me he didn't feel comfortable operating on me because of my size.</p>

      <p>"He denied me surgery because he said the radiation wouldn't get through to my neck because of all the fat.</p>
      <p>"But I still didn't take that for an answer."</p>
      <p>She claims they told her total removal of the tongue was the only option.</p>
      <p>But she visited a dozen hospitals across New York City before a doctor agreed to carry out a forearm flap reconstruction and a glossectomy which removed 95 per cent of her tongue.</p>
      <p>Jen said: "Although the new tongue is there, it has no movement and no feeling.</p>
      <p>"It's just there and takes up the empty space.</p>
      <p>"I was told I would need to be fed through a tube for the rest of my life.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>"I was also told I would just have a 30 per cent chance to survive the next five years as my cancer was extreme.</p>
      <p>"I was completely numb. I felt my life was over.</p>
      <p>"Even if I defied the odds and survived it wasn't a way to live.</p>
      <p>"To be honest I don't know how I survived it."</p>
      <p>Doctors initially told Jen she would have to be hooked up to a ventilator to help monitor her breathing, but again she defied odds by teaching herself to breathe unaided.</p>
      <p>For the past two-and-a-half years Jen has been on a diet of liquid shakes which - coupled with three skin removal surgeries - has seen her weight drop from 46 stone to a remarkable 12 stone.</p>
      <p>"I just know if I wasn't told I had cancer, I wouldn't be here today," she said.</p>
      <p>"I would have just continued sitting there eating my life away.</p>
      <p>"I've lost the ability to taste and chew things properly.</p>
      <p>"But I took advantage of that when I had it.</p>
      <p>"Because I'm not eating as much, I have so much excess skin.</p>

      <p>"I've had a few skin removal surgeries which has helped me loose the weight.</p>
      <p>"The diagnosis just turned my life completely around.</p>
      <p>"I had to die a little in order to learn to appreciate how it felt to be truly alive.</p>
      <p>"I'm alive for the very first time in my life."</p>
