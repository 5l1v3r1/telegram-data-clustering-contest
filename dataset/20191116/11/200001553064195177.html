      <h1>Barcelona define transfer ‘priorities’ to strengthen three positions – Identified one player as target</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:08:33+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/naveen-ullal/" target="_blank">Naveen Ullal</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona have defined their ‘priorities’ for next summer, claims journalist Miguel Rico on the back page of <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/">Mundo Deportivo</a>.</p>
      <p>He states the La Liga winners want to bring in a new No 9, even though Luis Suárez still remains ‘untouchable’ at the club.</p>
      <p>However, the Uruguayan’s age (he’ll turn 33 in January) and contract situation (expires in 2021) will make the Catalan club look for replacements.</p>
      <p>Rico says sources from the Camp Nou have confirmed the Blaugrana are looking for a ‘pure centre forward’ whose characteristics are different to those of Antoine Griezmann.</p>
      <p>They have identified Lautaro Martínez as a target. The Spanish champions are one of the top clubs who are after the Inter Milan striker, who is 10 years younger than Suárez.</p>
      <p>Apart from a No 9, Rico explains Barcelona have prioritised signing a right-back and a central defender.</p>
      <p>Nélson Semedo and Moussa Wagué are the two right-backs, while Sergi Roberto can also play in that position. Rico states Wagué is better than the Portugal international when it comes to attack, but he cannot defend, which is why they are looking for alternatives. </p>

      <p>In the centre-back position, Samuel Umtiti has struggled with injuries and Barcelona want to make the Frenchman understand he doesn’t have a future at the club.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, Gerard Piqué will turn 33 in February. Therefore, it’s necessary for Barca to bring in a new central defender.</p>
