        <b>KSI <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ksi-triumphs-logan-paul-boxing-rematch-fierce-fight-11068044/">has reflected on his triumphant win against Logan Paul</a> – and he had some strong words for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s kicking off.</p>
      <p>The Love Yourself singer was left red-faced<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/justin-bieber-hypes-logan-paul-prepares-epic-ksi-rematch-11072443/"> after going full force into supporting the American YouTuber</a>, later even refusing to believe the end result.</p>
      <p>However, KSI – real name Olajide ‘JJ’ Olatunji – isn’t bothered about Biebs. In fact, the situation appears to have cracked him up.</p>
      <p>‘A lot of influential people were hoping for my downfall, including Justin Bieber and, well, it sucks to be him right now. Get mad,’ the YouTube star giggled.</p>

      <p>‘Justin Bieber was in the ring while I was in the ring as well. He was on the opposite side though, because man’s afraid of me. Literally I was mouthing to him: “Logan didn’t win. Logan didn’t win.”‘</p>
      <p>JJ continued: ‘And then I<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/24/justin-bieber-urges-logan-paul-rip-ksis-head-off-rematch-amid-uk-press-conference-row-10798105/"> said, “Ah, he didn’t rip my head off, did he?”</a> Justin Bieber was just sarcastically smiling…my man was so triggered.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Pulling up a screenshot of Justin Bieber’s Instagram post, which declared ‘REALITY..LOGAN PAUL CHAMPION’, the YouTuber added: ‘Clearly he’s not living in reality and is delusional as f*** so Justin Bieber – let me confirm this reality.</p>
      <p>‘Here is my boxing record, and here is Logan’s. Hopefully you can see how stupid you look.’</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old also took aim at Logan’s coach Shannon Briggs, mocking his comment about Logan ‘being white and having legs’, before sincerely opening up about how proud he is of what the pair have achieved.</p>
      <p>KSI defeated Logan against the odds,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/ksi-lets-hair-logan-paul-fight-enjoys-swanky-vegas-night-11122659/"> making sure to have a party in Las Vegas like no other following the win.</a></p>
      <p>However, the Paul brothers haven’t stayed quiet following the result (is anyone surprised?) with Logan claiming he’s going to contest the Commission.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/jake-paul-defends-claims-ksi-vs-logan-paul-rematch-rigged-11123902/"> his younger brother Jake shared a video of himself breaking down in tears</a> following the loss, getting into a heated argument with heavyweight champ Shannon.</p>
      <p>With KSI fans urging the brothers to simply ‘take the L’, it seems all is a lot calmer on the British side of the pond.</p>
