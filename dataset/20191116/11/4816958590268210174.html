      <p>PARIS — Paris police fired tear gas in northwestern and southern Paris on Saturday to drive back protesters marking the first anniversary of anti-government “yellow vest” demonstrations.</p>
      <p>On the Place d’Italie in southern Paris, demonstrators, many clad in black and hiding their faces, set trash bins on fire and hurled projectiles at riot police while building barricades.</p>
      <p>Clashes broke out between demonstrators and police near the Porte de Champerret as protesters were preparing to march across town towards Gare d’Austerlitz.</p>
      <p>Police also intervened to prevent a few hundred demonstrators from occupying the Paris ring road, according to Reuters TV footage.</p>
      <p>Paris police said 33 people had been arrested by 1030 GMT.</p>
      <p>The so-called yellow vest protests, named for the high-visibility jackets worn by demonstrators, erupted in mid-November 2018 over fuel price hikes and the high cost of living. The demonstrations spiraled into a broader movement against President Emmanuel Macron and his economic reforms.</p>
      <p>The protests lost strength in recent months, going from tens of thousands of participants to just a few thousand, but the movement’s leaders called for people to turn out on Saturday to mark the first anniversary.</p>
      <p>At its peak in late 2018, the movement grew to up to 300,000 people.</p>
      <p>Protests have been banned near tourists spots such as the Eiffel Tower and many subway stations were closed on Saturday.</p>
      <p>MACRON HEADACHE</p>
      <p>The yellow vest movement was one of the toughest challenges to Macron’s presidency before it dwindled in the early summer.</p>
      <p>The movement evolved from nationwide road blockades into a series of often-violent demonstrations that pitted rowdy protesters with police and have ravaged Paris and other major cities in the country.</p>
      <p>The yellow vest crisis forced Macron to make policy concessions and delay the next big wave of reforms, including overhauling the pension and unemployment systems.</p>
      <p>A survey by pollster Odoxa published two weeks ago showed nearly one in every two French people believed the protest movement might reawaken.</p>
      <p>Macron’s plans to simplify the unwieldy and expensive pension system, which he says will make it fairer, is particularly unpopular.</p>
      <p>Trade unions have called on railway workers, Paris public transport staff, truck drivers and civil servants to strike against the pensions overhaul on Dec. 5, and in some cases beyond.</p>
      <p>Students and yellow vest protesters have called for people to join forces with the unions.</p>
      <p>On Thursday Macron promised money for hospitals in a bid to quell unrest among medics. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon Editing by David Evans and Frances Kerry)</p>
