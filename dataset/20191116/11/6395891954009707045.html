      <p><b>FRANKFORT, Ky.</b> - A Kentucky man’s three-year legal battle ended Wednesday when a federal court ruled his request for a personalized license plate qualifies as private speech protected by the First Amendment, the <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2019/11/13/kentucky-license-plates-man-okd-for-im-god-plate/4181142002/">Courier Journal</a> reported. </p>

      <p>Ben Hart attempted to obtain a vanity plate reading “IM GOD” in 2016, but the <a href="https://transportation.ky.gov/Pages/Home.aspx">Kentucky Transportation Cabinet</a> denied the request for violating antidiscrimination guidelines, <a href="https://apnews.com/b508ac7343734476ab6d67344eabdc8d">The Associated Press</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2019/11/13/kentucky-license-plates-man-okd-for-im-god-plate/4181142002/">Courier Journal</a>, citing court documents, reported the transportation cabinet has previously approved such personalized plates as “GODLVS,” “TRYGOD,” “1GOD” and “NOGOD”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aclu-ky.org/en/news/victory-kentucky-man-wins-right-have-im-god-license-plate?fbclid=IwAR1uCtQaE1tp5_1-MJMUVzYURT73i6tMi1-yV6cJvcxo61_U9wTDvoIlTvI">In its ruling</a>, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern Court of Kentucky wrote: “The Commonwealth [of Kentucky] went too far…To allow such plates as ‘IM4GOD’ and ‘LUVGOD’ but reject ‘IM GOD’ belies viewpoint neutrality…Regardless, the court concludes that in this case, [the statute governing such license plates] is an unreasonable and therefore impermissible restriction on Mr. Hart’s First Amendment rights.”</p>
      <p>In a statement provided to the <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2019/11/13/kentucky-license-plates-man-okd-for-im-god-plate/4181142002/">Courier Journal</a>, Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, said the court’s ruling affirmed Hart’s argument that the denial of his request was “pure discrimination.”</p>
      <p>“We are delighted that the court realized the bias the state of Kentucky was displaying toward nonbelievers,” Gaylor told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Both the foundation and Kentucky’s American Civil Liberties Union backed Hart’s legal battle, <a href="https://apnews.com/b508ac7343734476ab6d67344eabdc8d">The AP reported</a>. The organizations <a href="https://www.aclu-ky.org/en/news/victory-kentucky-man-wins-right-have-im-god-license-plate?fbclid=IwAR1uCtQaE1tp5_1-MJMUVzYURT73i6tMi1-yV6cJvcxo61_U9wTDvoIlTvI">issued a joint statement with Hart</a> following the ruling.</p>
      <p>“I’m thankful to finally have the same opportunity to select a personal message for my license plate just as any other driver,” Hart said <a href="https://www.aclu-ky.org/en/news/victory-kentucky-man-wins-right-have-im-god-license-plate?fbclid=IwAR1uCtQaE1tp5_1-MJMUVzYURT73i6tMi1-yV6cJvcxo61_U9wTDvoIlTvI">in the statement</a>. “There is nothing inappropriate about my view that religious beliefs are subject to individual interpretation.”</p>
