      <h3>ANOTHER round of mixed price adjustments on petroleum products are likely to be imposed next week.</h3>
      <p>Based on the advisory of independent oil player Unioil Philippines, diesel prices are estimated to drop from 30 centavos to 25Â  centavos per liter while gasoline prices are likely to increase by 80 centavos to 90 centavos per liter.</p>
      <p>Most independent oil firms like Unioil do not sell kerosene products.</p>
