      <p>Boxing legend Ricky Hatton has been criticised for his choice of fancy dress outfit.</p>
      <p>Hatton has made a trip to Benidorm for the resort's fancy dress bash as part of its fiesta season.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old was pictured arriving as a jockey, with what appeared to be a giant penis hanging in front of his silks.</p>
      <p>Images have emerged of Hatton laughing and joking with his fan as he held a pint.</p>
      <p>The post was shared on a Benidorm <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page with many criticising the 'bad taste' outfit.</p>

      <p>One person wrote: "It’s a bit much when there’s kids around.''</p>
      <p>Thousands of Brits have descended on Benidorm once again to take part in the celebrations.</p>
      <p>Hatton was joined by a group of pals in fancy dress, with others wearing costumes of priests, robbers and Snow White.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Hatton is working with Love Island star Tommy Fury ahead of his return to the ring.</p>
      <p>And Fury, brother of heavyweight superstar Tyson, has shot down rumours Hatton has prevented him from having sex with girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague.</p>
      <p>Asked if Ricky had asked them to cool off their bedroom antics, Tommy gave a firm 'no.'</p>
      <p>"No, Ricky trains me, he does everything perfect and at the end of the day my private life is my private life," he said.</p>
      <p>Fury is set to make his long-awaited return to boxing on December 12.</p>
