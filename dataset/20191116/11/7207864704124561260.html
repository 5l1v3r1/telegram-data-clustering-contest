      <h1>Stribog SP9A1: The Best Pistol Caliber Carbine on the Planet?</h1>
      <h2>Many think so. So we decided to take a look.</h2>

      <p>As pistol caliber carbines (PCCs) see a resurgence in popularity, an odd Slovakian carbine has become the darling of many in the gun media. Complete with a healthy dose of Slavic branding and a lot of design cues taken from the much more expensive B&amp;T APC9, the Stribog SP9A1 is considered by some to be one of the best PCCs in its price range.</p>
      <p>But how does it compare to other designs on the market? From just across the border, the Czech Scorpion EVO 3 is the current market leader and a big rival. Other designs such as various American clones of the Russian PP-19-01 Vityaz are also gaining popularity. Swiss B&amp;T also has a lower price offering in the GHM9, and even the American CMMG has developed an innovative PCC in its “Mk” series of radially delayed blowback carbines.</p>
      <p>First, the action. Like most PCCs on the cheaper range of the spectrum, the Stribog SP9A1 is a straight blowback. But like other, more recent straight blowbacks it features a rubber buffer at the end of the bolt’s travel to dampen the recoil. These buffers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with the fanciest being a hydraulic piston used in the B&amp;T APC9. The Stribog’s is fairly simple, being a series of polymer pads in the recoil path of the bolt. By most accounts, the buffer works fairly well, rendering it with a recoil impulse nicer than that of pure blowbacks, but still worse than most locking bolt designs. A similar design is used on the PSA AK-V.</p>
      <p>Ergonomically, the SP9 is pretty generic, featuring the proven layout of most modern long guns: magazine catch pressable by the trigger finger on both sides, and a rotating selector accessible by the thumb. The charging handle is placed forwards in the handguard, easily accessible and non-reciprocating on current versions. Where it differs is in the bolt catch, which is a lever that moves up and down as opposed to a simple “button”. The benefits come from the catch being the same on both sides, but this can lead to some confusion for those used to AR-style controls, as one much depress the lever instead of just pressing a button to release the bolt. However, it is similar to the CZ Scorpion, which also features a lever as a bolt catch. As with most modern guns, the stock and pistol grip can be swapped out for most AR-compatible pistol grips and stocks (with an adapter).</p>
      <p>Overall, what PCC is best comes down to what “parts ecosystem” a user is already part of. In the sub-$1,000 range, if one is familiar with ARs, but doesn’t want to buy an AR-style PCC, the Stribog would be a good choice. If one is familiar with AKs, the AK-V. The Scorpion is the odd one out, having its own set of proprietary parts. But all are basically the same despite their differences, with the better gun for an end-user largely coming down to personal preference. However, none are as good as those in the more expensive range such as clones of the MP5, CMMG’s Mk-series, or B&amp;T’s APC9 Pro.</p>
