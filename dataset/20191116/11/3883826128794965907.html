      <h1>Uber's paradox: Gig work app traps and frees its drivers</h1>

        <b>On 24 November, after a nervous wait, Uber will learn whether its licence to operate in London is to be renewed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The impending decision has revived debate over whether the data-driven basis for its business model and the "gig economy" jobs it creates are fair.</p>
      <p>A wave of platforms has followed, offering new ways to buy and sell, to rent from and temporarily hire others.</p>
      <p>Rather than salaried employees, independent contractors are paid by consumers for a specific job - a "gig".</p>
      <p>The platforms in the middle argue they do not employ staff but simply connect customers with people seeking to make money.</p>
      <p>Research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) estimates that one in 10 workers in the UK now regularly does "platform work".</p>
      <p>No company is more symbolic of this shift than Uber itself.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, it has become a lightning rod for arguments about what gig work really represents.</p>
      <p>Does it usher in new, flexible, liberating ways to work, or is it the means for a kind of arms-length control that undermines basic rights?</p>
      <p>Abdura Hadi, an Uber driver who has worked on the streets of London for five years, has noticed a change.</p>

        <figcaption>Mr Hadi relies for work on Uber's job-allocation algorithm but says he is does not know how it works</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"On average, I used to work six-to-eight hours, six days a week to provide for my family" he told me. Now, he adds: "It's 10-to-12 hours."</p>
      <p>He's noticed that over the period, the number of Uber drivers has rapidly increased, while the number of pick-up jobs has not kept up.</p>
      <p>Increased competition has made a particular part of Uber's platform critical to Mr Hadi and his fellow drivers' earning power - the software that determines who gets each ride.</p>
      <p>However, none of them knows how it works.</p>
      <p>"My family depends on the algorithm," he explains.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it's scary, but if it was fair, it would be OK."</p>
      <h3>Minimum wage</h3>
      <p>At the heart of the controversy around Uber is that the disruption it has brought isn't just economic, but also legal.</p>

      <p>Definitions that were once reasonably clear in the workplace have become muddied.</p>
      <p>The question of whether Uber drivers are actually employees is currently making its way through the British courts.</p>
      <p>Even one of the most basic facts of any job has become disputed: how much Uber drivers actually earn.</p>
      <p>"It's a fact that drivers are working on less than minimum wage," claims Mr Hadi.</p>
      <p>Yet a recent study co-authored by researchers at Oxford University and Uber, based on administrative data from the company, reported that the median London driver earns about £11 per hour spent logged into the app.</p>
      <p>That is just above the London Living Wage.</p>
      <p>The study included vehicle operation costs and time spent waiting between rides while logged in.</p>
      <h3>Data v anecdotes</h3>
      <p>Ken Jacobs, an academic at University of California, Berkeley, who has studied hidden costs that Uber drivers and other gig workers face, refers to them as the five "major loopholes".</p>
      <p>They include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>time spent waiting for rides</li>
        <li>the cost of driving back into busy areas after a ride</li>
        <li>vehicle maintenance and insurance</li>
        <li>the lack of payment for sick leave, meal breaks and rest breaks</li>
        <li>the lack of holiday pay</li>
      </ul>
      <p>"They tend to way underestimate the actual expenses a driver incurs," he said.</p>
      <p>Meera Joshi, the former head of the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission, the regulator responsible for services like Uber across the city, says data is key.</p>
      <p>"Without data you only have anecdotes," she told me.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"You have stories from drivers about low wages, but you have no way to really quantify that."</p>
      <p>In perhaps the first move of its kind, Ms Joshi's commission forced Uber to hand over data about its drivers operating in New York.</p>
      <p>"What we found out was that conditions were worse than what was described to us by drivers," she said.</p>
      <p>"Ninety-six per cent of drivers were making less than the city's minimum wage. Most of the drivers were providing the main source of income for their families."</p>
      <p>After the watchdog implemented minimum-wage protections to cover the 80,000 New York drivers involved, an additional $225m (£172m) per month went "back into the pockets of drivers", said Ms Joshi.</p>
      <p>As a result, the cash flowed into local neighbourhoods rather than back to San Francisco-based Uber.</p>
      <h3>'Prison and liberator'</h3>
      <p>The Oxford paper also claimed that Uber drivers had higher levels of life satisfaction than other workers, but also higher anxiety levels.</p>
      <p>"That's the paradox of Uber," commented Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation.</p>
      <p>"It is both a prison and a liberator. You can just switch on the app and start working, but if you have a family to support, it's obviously less flexible. You need to match peaks of demand: rush hours and weekends."</p>
      <p>And Uber is just the "tip of the iceberg", he added.</p>
      <p>"The majority of gig-economy workers are women, doing care, cleaning.</p>
      <p>"Under the water level, you have platforms openly advertising rates beneath minimum wage."</p>
      <p>Uber has taken steps to benefit the drivers ahead of the licensing deadline. For example, last week it added a button to their app to let them report racism or other discriminatory behaviour from passengers, who it promises to kick off its platform if the complaint is upheld.</p>
      <p>"Drivers are at the heart of our service - we can't succeed without them - and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Whether it's being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we'll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers."</p>
      <p>But in many ways, the gig economy simply reintroduces very old issues of conditions and rights in the workplace in new ways.</p>
      <p>Previous decades saw the struggles of employees to have their rights recognised; now the struggle is one of workers to be recognised as employees at all.</p>
      <p>Once the focus was on the power of the owners of the means of production; now it is on the owners of the means to find work via the net.</p>
      <p>The new battleground is not over who controls the shop floor, but who controls the data involved. Who has it, and what it reveals.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens on 24 November, the wider debate will continue for a long time yet.</p>
