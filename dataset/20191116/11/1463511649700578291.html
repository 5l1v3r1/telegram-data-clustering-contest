      <p>Former President, Goodluck Jonathan, has expressed disappointment over the late arrival of election materials to his Polling Unit 39, Ward 13, in Otuoke, Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>Jonathan, who was expecting to cast his vote, stepped out of his house at 8:30 a.m., but met only journalists as the Independent National Electoral Commission officials were yet to arrive at the venue.</p>
      <p>“Are you an electoral officer, where are they?” The former president asked a journalist at the venue.</p>
      <p>“Well this is where I will vote, but since they are not here yet, let me go back inside.</p>
      <p>“You see now, youths of nowadays, you need to do more,” he stated.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that at the time of filing this report at 10:30 a.m, no official has arrived at the polling unit with materials for the exercise.</p>
