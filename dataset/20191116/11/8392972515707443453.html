      <p>The actress was joined by a group of her co-stars for the EastEnders' special and ended up taking home the CiN Glitterball Trophy.</p>
      <p>After head judge Shirley Ballas announced that she and Kevin were the night's winners, Maisie jumped up and down and squealed with delight.</p>
      <p>She then gushed: "I've honestly had the best week. It's just been amazing!"</p>

      <p>Fans of the show are now calling for Strictly Come Dancing bosses to nab Maisie for next year's series of the BBC One dancing show.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, one pleaded: "Is it just me that's hoping &amp; praying that @maisie_smithwill be on next year's @bbcstrictly.</p>
      <p>"She was amazing tonight! #ChildrenInNeed2019."</p>
      <aside>Well if @bbcstrictly don’t sign Maisie Smith up for next year's series they’re seriously missing a trick.</aside>
      <p>Tweeting Maisie and Kevin directly, another said: "Would love to see you both coupled up on next year's strictly as you were both incredible. I think Maisie would be amazing at ballroom and latin."</p>
      <p>A third even wrote: "Well if @bbcstrictly don’t sign Maisie Smith up for next year's series they’re seriously missing a trick. She was brilliant!!!!"</p>
