      <p>This was also India’s sixth consecutive Test win, equaling their best ever run in this format. If they win the 2nd Test vs Bangladesh, they will better this record.</p>
      <p>India had previously won six consecutive matches under MS Dhoni in 2013 – four vs Australia and two vs West Indies.</p>
      <p>Also, this was India’s third consecutive innings win – with the last two Tests, against South Africa – having gone a similar way. In terms of innings wins, this equals India’s best ever run. India had beaten Sri Lanka by an innings in three consecutive matches in 1993/94.</p>
