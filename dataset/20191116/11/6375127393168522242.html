      <h3>BUTTRESSING its support to the Department of Tourism’s (DOT) shopping tourism, Duty Free Philippines (DFP) officially launched its outlet in Pasay City, the Duty Free Luxe.</h3>
      <p>“(Today) marks the culmination of an idea that began years ago. An idea of a world-class duty-free store that will put the Philippines as a top-of-mind shopping destination to boost the country’s shopping tourism,” Duty Free Philippines Corp. Chief Operating Officer Vicente Angala told reporters.</p>
      <p>Angala noted that shopping is now a “determinant factor affecting destination choice” and is often a “prime travel motivation.”</p>
      <p>“Duty Free Philippines Corp. acknowledged that vital role and to stay ahead of our competitors and strengthen the Philippines as a great destination for travelers, we continued to explore ways to offer unique and extraordinary experiences that others cannot replicate easily,” he said.</p>
      <p>During the grand launch of the DFP outlet, three famous international brands: MCM, Hogan and Hugo Boss for the first time opened their boutiques at the Luxe. Marahuyo, an all-Filipino store that sells high end Filipino designer products was also officially opened.</p>
      <p>The ceremony was followed by the lighting of the DFP Christmas tree by Angala and Senator Nancy Binay.</p>
      <p>“We need additional spaces, especially in airports, so we can invite more brands to come in. Definitely, once we have additional brands, our sales will increase,” he added.</p>
      <p>Last year, the DOT revealed a survey on foreign visitors showed that shopping tops the list of tourist activities in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>The Visitor Sample Survey was conducted on some 15,000 respondents from the top 12 foreign tourists arriving in the country from January to December 2017. </p>
      <p>Tourists from South Korea, People’s Republic of China, the United States, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and India were asked “What other activities did you actually do aside from the main purpose?”</p>
