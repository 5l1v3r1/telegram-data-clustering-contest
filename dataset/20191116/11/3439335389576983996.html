      <p>The students at <a href="https://keonepokoelementary.org/">Keonepoko Elementary</a> school in Pahoa just want a playground to play on during recess.</p>
      <p>For two years, their campus playground has been condemned and cordoned off with yellow caution tape, and students have been making do with a grassy area and single walkway. The students, approximately 575 in all, have no swings, slides or play structure.</p>
      <p>To change this, teachers at the school have launched a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-keonepoko-build-a-playground?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unknown&amp;utm_campaign=comms_b99+help-keonepoko-build-a-playground">GoFundMe </a><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-keonepoko-build-a-playground?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unknown&amp;utm_campaign=comms_b99+help-keonepoko-build-a-playground">campaign</a>, seeking to raise $375,000 to help the school build a new playground on campus. Funds from the campaign will go into an account run by Friends of Keonepoko, a nonprofit led by special education teacher Judith Tang.</p>
      <p>“We just want a playground,” said Tang. “I thought, even though we went a whole year without it being fixed, I thought it would be fixed when I came back [from summer break]…These kids are going another year without a playground…We want it to happen.”</p>
      <p>As part of the campaign, second-graders and teacher Christi-Jean Donnelly sing a song asking for a playground in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=137&amp;amp=&amp;v=Ttv15gx12Kw&amp;amp=&amp;feature=emb_logo">video posted to YouTube</a>, with the help of music teacher Jenifer Tsugi.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Education condemned the playground in 2017 after high humidity and rain rusted the play equipment, and it was deemed unsafe for children to play on.</p>
      <p>Tang said the school is on a waiting list, but that it might be another three years before it gets a new playground. She decided to take initiative with the campaign, with the thought that some kindergarteners at the school would not get an opportunity to play on a playground at recess for years.</p>
      <p>Design plans have not been finalized yet, Tang said, but she is envisioning a play structure that offers kids a mental as well as physical challenge, a swing that children can lay on, a basketball court and benches with shade.</p>
      <p>Many of the staff, as well as parents of children who attend the school, she said, lost their homes or were forced to evacuate during the 2018 Kilauea eruption.</p>
      <p>The state DOE will contribute $100,000 toward the new playground, a spokeswoman said, and will also pay for the removal of the existing playground.</p>
