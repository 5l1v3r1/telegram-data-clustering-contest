        <b>Did you know that Varun Dhawan was approached by Andhadhun director Sriram Raghvan to play the lead character in the film? He rejected it and the film fell in Ayushmann Khurrana's kitty</b>
      </p>
      <p>Varun Dhawan was apparently approached by Andhadhun director Sriram Raghvan to play the lead character in the film. For reasons unknown, the Kalank actor turned down the project. The film eventually went to Ayushmann Khurrana who decided to take it up and show off his acting skills in a quirky project. The film, which released in October last year, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/box-office-collections/andhadhun-loveyatri-box-office-collection-day-1-ayushmann-khurrana-radhika-apte-aayush-sharma-warina-hussian-go-slightly-lazy/5bb89c25cb47da50311b4519">made waves with its content and was a blockbuster at the box-office</a>. Ayushmann Khurrana even <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/66th-national-film-awards-complete-winner-list-uri-andhadhun-padman-announced-as-big-winners/5d4d4a8c5203ad3741452c8b">won a national award for the same</a>. Varun obviously regrets rejecting this critically acclaimed film, however, he made sure to be a part of Raghvan's next film.</p>
      <p>According to a report in Zoom, Varun Dhawan, who regrets turning down Andhadun, approached director Sriram Raghvan, when he learnt that he is working on an interesting project - Arun Khetarpal. Known to share a cordial relationship since their Badlapur days, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/varun-dhawan-to-star-in-1971-indo-pak-war-martyr-arun-khetarpal-s-biopic/5da403dc87fb571eff7e2712">Sriram Raghvan decided to star Varun Dhawan in Khetarpal</a>. Well yes, this is how Varun Dhawan ended up being a part of Arun Khetarpal biopic. <b>(ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/varun-dhawan-s-gf-natasha-dalal-says-marriage-is-on-the-cards-reveals-school-love-bloomed-into-lifelong-love/5dc4207f87fb571eff7e38cf">Varun Dhawan’s GF Natasha Dalal Says, ‘Marriage Is On The Cards’; Reveals School Love Bloomed Into Lifelong Love</a>)</b></p>

      <p>The film is based on the real-life story of the Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, who martyred during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. He showed extreme bravery as he faced fierce and unrelenting attacks by the Pakistani military when he was just twenty-one years old. Khetarpal was also honoured with India's most-prestigious and highest-standard military medal for courage and gallantry- the Param Vir Chakra, posthumously.<br/><br/><i>Images Source: instagram/Varun_dvn/newsjiffy.in</i></p>
