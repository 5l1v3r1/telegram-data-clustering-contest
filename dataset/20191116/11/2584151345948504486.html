      <h2>Senior Brexit Party figures claim Conservatives offered benefits in exchange for not standing in the election.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T11:01:12+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Wheaton</a></address>
      <p>U.K. police said Saturday they are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud, following accusations the Conservative party offered key Brexit Party members seats in the House of Lords if they do not stand in December’s general election.</p>
      <p>London’s Metropolitan Police <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50443430">told the BBC</a> it is looking into “two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the 2019 General Election.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/13/tories-offer-nigel-farage-eleventh-hour-deal/">Earlier this week</a>, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said top Tory officials tried to get Brexit Party candidates to withdraw from standing in the election by offering spots in the parliament’s upper house.</p>
      <p>A senior member of the opposition Labour Party in the House of Lords on Friday <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/lord-falconer-calls-for-probe-into-claims-brexit-party-were-offered-peerages-to-stand-aside-in-a4288681.html">wrote to the police</a> to request that the “exceptionally serious allegations” be investigated as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p>The letter to police by Lord Charlie Falconer also makes reference to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/nigel-farage-says-he-is-unlikely-to-vote-for-any-party-in-election">accusation</a> from Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe that the Tories offered her a role in future Brexit negotiations if she declined to run.</p>
      <p>The high stakes for Brexit in the December 12 vote are heightening interest in the idea of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/peaks-pitfalls-of-tactical-voting/">tactical voting</a>. Amid concerns the Brexit Party could split the pro-Brexit vote in some districts, reducing the likelihood of a Conservative victory, Farage agreed not to have Brexit Party candidates compete in districts the Tories won in 2017.</p>
      <p>However, he’s since accused Downing Street of going behind his back to pressure other officials to stand down.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged there might have been conversations among the party leaders but has denied that seats in the House of Lords had been offered — <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50434525">branding the claims</a> “nonsense.”</p>
      <p>Michael Gove, a Tory Cabinet minister, said the allegations sound “pretty nonsensical” in an <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/michael-gove-dismisses-nigel-farages-nonsensical-claim-brexit-party-candidates-were-offered-peerages-a4288721.html">interview with Radio 4</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In its statement to the BBC, the police said a special enquiry team is investigating two allegations received but would not comment on individual cases.</p>
