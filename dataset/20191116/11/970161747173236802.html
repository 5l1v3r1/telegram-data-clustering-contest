      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> star, 15, made headlines after she told Harper’s Bazaar that she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/stranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-15-wants-to-show-off-womanhood-with-more-fitted-clothes-11165163/">wanted to wear more fitted clothes to embrace her ‘womanhood’</a>.</p>

      <p>‘I think about the girls who are going to look at the picture – those young girls that are going to look at me and if they think, “Wow that’s what I should dress up as”.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘They are my age, so those are the ones I think of. I want to make sure that I’m influencing being your age and being who you are in that time of your life.</p>
      <p>‘It’s always difficult to dress for a red carpet event because a lot of people have opinions and unfortunately you say you won’t listen to it, but you actually kind of have to.</p>
