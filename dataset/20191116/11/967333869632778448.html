      <p>The planned time for the resumption of transport services has not been reported.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911151077315836-yellow-vest-protests-cost-france-nearly-three-billion-euro---reports/">The movement plans large-scale weekend protests</a>, including unauthorised gatherings, across France.</p>
      <p>The wave of Yellow Vests rallies started in France on 17 November 2018. The protests were initially triggered by the government's intention to increase fuel taxes.</p>
      <p>Even though the authorities abandoned their initial plan and introduced a set of measures to improve the socio-economic situation, protesters continue to take to the streets across France every weekend to express their wider discontent with the government's policies.</p>
