        <b>Children in Need, the tireless five-hour primetime TV appeal backing 3,000 local projects nationwide, provided its annual light entertainment on BBC One last night, featuring a procession of big names and small screen favourites from shows including Strictly Come Dancing, Call the Midwife, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> and EastEnders.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> singer Louis Tomlinson, opera giants Michael Ball and Alfie Boe, boyband Westlife and pop stars <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/nadine-coyle-jokes-pudsey-trophy-can-travel-raises-10000-children-need-im-celeb-stint-11165910/">Nadine Coyle</a>, Heidi Range and Antony Costa were among the artists taking part across a programme that created its own version of Strictly Come Dancing and invited youngsters onto Graham Norton’s revered red sofa.</p>
      <p>Reality TV regular Rylan Clark-Neal joined in, fresh from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/rylan-clark-neal-raises-1m-donations-exhausting-24-hour-karaoke-challenge-11124622/">raising £1 million with a 24-hour karaoke singalong</a> on BBC Radio 2, and the presenters introducing the fun included Tess Daly – usually seen interviewing acts straight off the Strictly dancefloor – and Mel Giedroyc.</p>

      <h3>How much money did Children In Need 2019 raise?</h3>
      <p>Presenter Rochelle Humes called the total proceeds of £47,886,382 a ‘spectacular’ sum, adding that she hoped it had honoured Sir Terry Wogan, the former presenter of the fundraising marathon who died in 2016.</p>
      <p>Love Island 2018 winner Dani Dyer, who presented a series of backstage interviews during the show with the likes of actor Shaun Dooley and Joe Wicks, the charity’s first ever Schools Ambassador, declared the figure ‘absolutely amazing’.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve had the most incredible night,’ gushed the 23-year-old, who spent her evening urging the public to donate to the BBC’s corporate charity that supports disadvantaged children and young people across the country.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve had so much fun and met such cool, cool people – I never even thought I’d meet Graham Norton.’</p>
      <h3>How much has Children in Need raised since it began?</h3>
      <p>The campaign and its yellow mascot bear, Pudsey, have surpassed the £1bn mark since first appearing in 1980.</p>
      <p>This year’s count was down on last year’s windfall of £50.6m but higher than the 2016 tot-up of £46.6m, although the final amount is likely to be significantly greater than the broadcast total announced – last year, the bottom line reached almost £61m.</p>
      <p>As well as raising money, a key theme of the campaign is raising awareness, which England footballers Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling helped to do when they appeared in a film showing them surprising children from the England Amputee Football Association.</p>

      <p>England and Tottenham’s Danny Rose also allowed children to quiz him as a guest in front of Graham Norton, appearing after newsreader Sophie Raworth had been cheekily sent tumbling backwards via the lever guests can use to tilt the interview chair used as part of the show.</p>

      <p>Asked to tell his young admirers a joke, Rose replied: ‘Why can’t cars play football? Because they’ve only got one boot.’ His young interrogator responded by sending the chuckling defender flying backwards from the chair.</p>
