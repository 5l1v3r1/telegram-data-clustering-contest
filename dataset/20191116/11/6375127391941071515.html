      <h3>SEVEN Chinese nationals who allegedly attempted to kidnap a couple – a male Chinese and a femaleTaiwanese -- were arrested by the Manila Police District-Plaza Miranda Poliçe Community Precinct.  </h3>
      <p>Already turned over to the MPD-General Assignment and Investigation Section (MPD-GAIS) were suspects Fen  Xiu  Tian, 24; Kang  Xin  Hang, 30;  Li Dong, 22; Yao  Shu, 23; Li You Bang, 28; Li Bing,  20  and Chan  Dang, 28, all Chinese nationals and residents of  20th Floor, Medical Plaza located at the corner of Amorsolo and Dela Rosa Streets, Legazpi Village, Makati City.</p>
      <p>A probe by GAIS showed that the alleged attempted kidnapping took place at around 6:20 p.m. in front of the Sun Star Grand Hotel on Quezon Boulevard in Quiapo, Manila the other night. The victims were identified as Chinese Xu Jun, 30, and Taiwanese Chloe Yuan, 35.</p>
      <p>The two were about to check in at the hotel but it was fully-booked so they asked a hotel employee to book them a cab service that would take them to a hotel in Las Pinas City.  </p>
      <p>As they were leaving the suspects allegedly dragged them into a silver grey<br/>passenger van.</p>
      <p>Witnesses saw the commotion and reported the matter to the Plaza Miranda PCP whose members, led by PLt.Reynante Martelino, quickly responded, resulting in the arrest of the suspects.</p>
      <p>The police are investigating if the incident had anything to do with casino gambling debts.</p>
