      <p>Dominic Matteo is being treated in hospital after having surgery on a brain tumour, his former club <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a> have said.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old underwent an operation on Monday and is currently being treated after coming out of intensive care, the club added in a statement.</p>
      <p>Matteo started his career with Liverpool, making 155 appearances, before moving to Leeds where he became a fan favourite after scoring the goal against Milan which earned them a place in the 2000-01 Champions League knockout stages.</p>
      <p>“The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Dom, his family and friends and we will be offering our support to them throughout this difficult time,” Liverpool said. “A popular member of the Liverpool side in the 1990s and a regular pundit and commentator on LFCTV in recent years, Matteo made his debut for the Reds in October 1993.</p>
      <p>“We wish Dom a full and speedy recovery and will offer any support we can to his wife and family. Dom’s family would like to place on record their gratitude to all staff at Leeds General Infirmary and express their thanks for all of the messages of support they have received.”</p>
      <p>Matteo won six <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland">Scotland</a> caps in his career, which ended with spells at Blackburn and Stoke.</p>
