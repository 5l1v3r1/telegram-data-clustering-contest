      <p>The bout started at a high pace with Miado coming close to claiming the finish via submission after he latched onto an arm during a scramble in the early throes of the contest.</p>
      <p>Once back on the feet, Miado seemed far more composed as Miao charged in and attempted to landed heavy shots. As the Chinese fighter looked to close the distance to land a left hook, “The Jaguar” exploded up from the canvas and landed a knee flush on Miao’s chin that separated him from his senses on contact.</p>
      <p>The win sees the Filipino Miado get back into the win column following a second-round stoppage defeat back in February. All three of Miado’s victories have come by way of stoppage under the ONE Championship banner.</p>
