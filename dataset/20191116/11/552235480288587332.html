      <h2>The Scottish broadcaster has invited Scottish leaders of Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and the SNP to take part in a debate on December 3.</h2>

      <p>A TV debate featuring four of the Scottish party leaders will be broadcast by STV.</p>
      <p>Leaders for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> , <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> , <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservatives</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrat-party">Liberal Democrats</a> will take part in the televised General Election debate set for December 3.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stv">STV</a> confirmed the format of the hour-long broadcast will see the party leaders debate each other directly, and questions from host Colin Mackay, STV's political editor.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-green-party">Scottish Greens</a> are the only political party with seats in the Scottish Parliament to be excluded from the debate, with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brexit-party">Brexit Party</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ukip">Ukip</a> - who are standing in 15 and seven Scottish seats respectively - also not invited to take part.</p>

      <p>A Scottish Greens spokesman said: "We're extremely disappointed that STV has chosen to include just the four establishment parties in its <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> leaders debate.</p>
      <p>"We are in the midst of a climate emergency and while Scottish Greens candidates across the country demand climate action, the other parties are part of a cosy political consensus on this key issue, all agreeing with one another.</p>
      <p>"Our record as Scotland's most influential opposition party; transforming Scotland's income tax system, leading the way on children's rights by providing them with equal protection from assault, and scrapping unnecessary invasive social security assessments shows the impact Scottish Greens politicians have.</p>
      <p>"Unlike the other parties the Scottish Greens don't have unlimited resources and millionaire donors. That's why our local branches need to decide carefully how to deploy resources and unfortunately that means we can't stand everywhere.</p>
      <p>"It's deeply depressing that STV has allowed an unfair voting system and financial advantage, rather than actual political influence, to drive its decision."</p>

      <p>The broadcaster also says it is planning a series of interviews with party leaders - including those from the Brexit Party and Scottish Greens - due to be aired at a later, unspecified date.</p>
      <p>A TV debate has already been announced by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC Scotland</a> , who will also host leaders from the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on December 10.</p>
      <p>There are also UK-wide political broadcasts planned, starting on Tuesday with a head-to-head debate between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> being aired on ITV, followed by a similar format on BBC One on December 6.</p>
      <p>Legal action is being threatened by the SNP and Liberal Democrats - the third and fourth biggest Westminster parties in terms of existing seats - against ITV for their exclusion from the national debates.</p>
