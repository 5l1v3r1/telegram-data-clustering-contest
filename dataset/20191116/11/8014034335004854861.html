      <p>SHENZHEN, China — The mainland Chinese students arriving from Hong Kong are huddled with their suitcases, waiting for a bus to take them to temporary accommodation in this city across the border from the protest-wracked territory.</p>
      <p>After anti-government demonstrators barricaded university campuses this week, hundreds of Chinese students have retreated to the mainland city of Shenzhen, where the ruling Communist Party’s Youth League promised them a “warm home.”</p>
      <p>The party organization said in a notice this week that mainland students could stay free-of-charge at one of 12 designated youth hostels in the southern Chinese city less than 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the chaos.</p>
      <p>Mainland students say they left because they feared being harassed by protesters.</p>
