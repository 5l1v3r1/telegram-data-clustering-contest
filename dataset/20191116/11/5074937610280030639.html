      <p>Accra, Nov. 15, GNA – The GOIL Company Limited, an indigenous Oil Marketing Company on Friday rolled-out comprehensive package dubbed; “GOIL Efie ne fie Reward scheme,” as a Christmas bonus for loyal customers to the brand over the year.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwesi Osei-Prempeh, GOIL Acting Managing Director assured customers and the motoring public that the company would not relent in its efforts to improve on the quality of products to satisfy its customers.</p>
      <p>Mr Osei-Prempeh who is also the Group Chief Executive Officer stated this at the National launch of GOIL 2019 Efie ne Fie Reward at the North Legon Service Station Haatso Road in Accra.</p>
      <p>The GOIL MD said the company would continue to re-invest in the Ghanaian economy and share with Ghanaians their profit through corporate social responsibility initiatives and through reward schemes such as Efie ne Fie package.</p>
      <p>He said the sales promotion campaign aimed at rewarding almost one million customers nationwide: Under the ‘Efie Ne Fie’ promotion campaign, customers who buy fuel for GH¢100.00 and above will instantly be rewarded with prizes.</p>
      <p>The three-month campaign starts from November 15, 2019 to January 2020.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwamena Bartels, Board Chairman of GOIL who launched the package campaign said it was not a raffle, but a promotion that “rewards customers instantly for patronising the company’s products.”</p>
      <p>Unlike raffles that require draws to determine winners, Mr Bartels explained that the ‘Efie ne Fie’ promotion rewards all persons instantly for consuming fuel from GH¢100.00 upwards in the case of four-whell vehicles and GH¢30.00 upwards in the case of motorbikes.</p>
      <p>He said as the biggest oil marketing company, GOIL was of the view that the profit the company made should be ploughed back into the economy to help benefit the citizens.</p>
      <p>That, he said, informed the decision to list on the Ghana Stock Exchange, resulting in over 16,000 individuals and institutions owning a part of the company.</p>
      <p>“So when you buy GOIL, you contribute to our economy by helping keep money back home,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Head of Fuels Marketing at GOIL, Mr Marcus Deo Dake, explained that customers “who buy the required amount of fuel will be given special cards in line with the promotion.”</p>
      <p>He said they were required to scratch and send the code to determine their prizes, which can be redeemed within 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Boxing legend and brand ambassador of GOIL, Mr Azumah Nelson, also encouraged consumers to patronise GOIL products.</p>
      <p>He said unlike other fuels, fuel from GOIL guaranteed value for money and also preserved car engines.</p>
      <p>Some of the rewards would be free fuel and branded items for instant winners and monthly draws.</p>
