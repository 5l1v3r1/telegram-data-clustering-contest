      <p>While no sort of official announcement has been made, rumblings continue that Santa Anita Park could be headed back to the days of racing over a synthetic surface, specifically Tapeta.</p>
      <p>The Arcadia, Calif., track installed a short-lived Cushion Track in 2007, only to revert to dirt in 2010. The synthetic detractors pointed to excessive heat absorbed by the surface and, anecdotally, soft tissue injuries experienced by horses running over it. But the numbers were clear: Santa Anita experienced some of its lowest rates of fatalities in seasons when not running over dirt.</p>
      <p>While the collection methods and criteria as to what constitutes a “race-related fatality” can be questioned, the <a href="http://jockeyclub.com/default.asp?section=Advocacy&amp;area=10">Jockey Club’s Equine Injury Database</a> illustrates a lower rate of fatalities over synthetic in every year since 2009. Also, in eight of the study's 10 years, synthetic surfaces measured fewer fatalities per 1,000 starts than turf.</p>

      <p>In February of 2006, the California Horse Racing Board mandated that all racetracks in the state which ran for more than four continuous weeks were required to install synthetic surfaces by the end of 2007.</p>
      <p>Santa Anita -- as well as Del Mar, Golden Gate, and the now-defunct Hollywood Park -- abided by the CHRB mandate and began its Oak Tree meeting on Oct. 3, 2007. Aunt Pink, guided by jockey Saul Arias and trained by Melvin Stute, won a $40,000 maiden claiming race going six furlongs in the first race on the that iteration of synthetic surface.</p>
      <p>But the Cushion Track brand of synthetic was a disaster for Santa Anita, as it failed to drain properly, resulting in missed racing days, high criticism, and ultimately a <b><a href="https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/151475/cushion-track-lawsuit-dismissal-denied">lawsuit against Cushion Track</a></b> which necessitated the subsequent <b><a href="https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/155525/santa-anita-to-replace-surface">change to the Pro-Ride synthetic track</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The Pro-Ride track was installed, and racing resumed at Santa Anita on Sept. 24, 2008. But this surface was also short-lived as well with dirt reintroduced in December of 2020. The rate of equine fatalities increased nearly five-fold the following year and has sat above the North American average ever since.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The Equine Injury Database began collecting information at Santa Anita in 2009, when the surface of the main track was Pro-Ride. In 84 racing dates during that year, 4,440 starters ran on the main track with four reported fatalities, a rate of 0.90 fatalities per 1,000 starts.</p>
      <p>The next year, 3,395 starters ran on the synthetic main track before it was replaced with dirt in December. There were two reported fatalities in the 3,395 starts on synthetic, a rate of 0.59 per 1,000 starts. The December 2010 races on dirt had only 290 starters, with one reported fatality, a rate of 3.45 per 1,000 in a small sample size.</p>
      <p>But in 2011, with all main track races being held on the new dirt surface, there were 13 reported fatalities in 4,425 starts, a rate of 2.94 per 1,000 starts. The North American average at all tracks where data was collected (over all surfaces) for 2011 was 1.88 per 1,000.</p>
      <p>The total number of fatalities reported at Santa Anita (all surfaces) has never been fewer than 2 per 1,000 since the switch from synthetic to dirt in late 2010. The North American average, however, has dipped below 2 since 2010.</p>

      <p>As with Santa Anita, Del Mar also went from dirt to synthetic and back to a dirt main track. Del Mar installed the Polytrack brand surface for the 2007 summer meet and resumed racing on dirt in 2015.</p>
      <p>Two of the four safest years at Del Mar in terms of fatalities per start have come in the last two years. Fatality rates on the dirt at Del Mar in 2017 and 2018 were 1.76 and 0.91, respectively, compared to the North American average of 1.74 and 1.86 during the same time frame.</p>
      <p>Santa Anita’s fatality rate of dirt in those two years were 2.27 in 2007 (12 fatalities in 5,292 starts) and 1.75 in 2018 (nine fatalities in 5,149 starts). The 2019 rate will be much higher following the spate of on-track deaths at Santa Anita this year.</p>
