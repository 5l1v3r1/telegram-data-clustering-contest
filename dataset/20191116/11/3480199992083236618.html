      <p>Heather Osborne, chief executive of Age UK Shropshire Telford &amp; Wrekin said: “This is an exciting opportunity to engage with local candidates on the issues that really matter to older people.</p>
      <p>“It’s important that older people get to exercise their democratic right and work towards a positive impact on local decision makers by highlighting what is important to them.”</p>
      <p>Residents are able to raise any concerns towards all major parties candidates on anything from transport, poverty or any other issues affecting older people in the region.</p>

      <p>He said: “Candidates that are standing in both Telford and Wrekin constituencies will be present.</p>
      <p>"People can submit questions on paper at the beginning, with one candidate from each party answering each question.</p>
      <p>"It’s your chance to participate in local democracy by asking candidates what they would do about key topics up for debate.”</p>
      <p>Questions can be presented on paper on November 28, from 10.30am to 12.30pm at Whitehouse Hotel in Wellington.</p>
