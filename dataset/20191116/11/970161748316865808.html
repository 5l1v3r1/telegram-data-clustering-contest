        <b>John Lewis has unleashed the latest character in its cast of cuddly animations fronting its Christmas advert campaigns, introducing viewers to a snaggle-toothed dragon named <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/john-lewis-christmas-2019-edgar-dragon-11088313/">Excitable Edgar</a> in a joint campaign with partner retailer Waitrose that it says is all about ‘the magic of friendship and making our loved ones feel special.’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dan Smith, singer for Alt-pop band <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bastille/">Bastille</a>, helped to provide the music for the 150-second burst of feelgood commercialism that follows a young girl, Ava, preparing for Christmas with her family and friends.</p>
      <p>Edgar is one of those friends, but the dragon’s enthusiasm for Christmas causes a burning issue as he struggles to contain his ability to breathe fire in his excitement for the festivities.</p>
      <p>The character’s molten outbursts melt a snowman and an ice-rink and put paid to the dressing of the local village Christmas tree, causing Edgar to decide to shut himself away to prevent any more problematic appearances in public.</p>

      <p>Fans of arguably the country’s most anticipated advert of the year are looking forward to seeing the sequence make its TV debut tonight, when it will air during ITV’s The X Factor: Celebrity.</p>

      <p>For many, the advert is inextricably linked to the Christmas spirit. So what time can you see it? Read on to find out…</p>
      <p>
        <b>When is the John Lewis advert on ITV?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As if X Factor: Celebrity isn’t exciting enough, one of its advert breaks will feature the premiere of Ava and Edgar’s adventures, which means <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/watch-john-lewis-christmas-advert-2019-11091061/">the commercial</a> could screen at any point between 8.20pm and 10.10pm tonight.</p>
      <p>Simon Cowell’s franchise is always laden with advert breaks, so it’s hard to predict exactly when the festive supermarket message will flicker onto our screens.</p>

      <p>Another musical institution, the London Contemporary Orchestra, has helped to soundtrack the campaign, which features Dan Smith’s take on Can’t Fight this Feeling, the 1984 power balled by REO Speedwagon that reached number one in four countries.</p>
      <p>Smith implied he wouldn’t mind receiving one of the spin-off Edgar toys from a campaign that features Ava presenting her fiery friend with a Christmas pudding.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve always had a lot of fun putting a twist on classic songs,’ says Smith. ‘It’s been so good to be a part of this orchestral version of an eighties classic.’</p>
      <p>If your excitement levels for the ad are already at Edgar level, you can watch the advert, which is thought to have cost around £7m to produce, online.</p>
      <p>Explaining the concept behind the commercial, John Lewis’s Craig Inglis said the brand aimed to devise a ‘funny, heartwarming story’.</p>

      <p>‘It started from a spark of an idea – a little dragon’s excitement about Christmas – and became the story of how someone goes the extra mile for their best friend to give just the right gift,’ he added.</p>
