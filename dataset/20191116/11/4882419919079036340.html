      <p>Eric Olhats, Antoine Griezmann's former representative, told RMC that he wouldn't have advised him to sign for Barcelona and doesn't think he has a promising future there.</p>
      <p>"There's surely a cause and effect with his actions and the experience he's having at Barcelona at this moment. He's in a new situation, on the wing, and not playing at the top of the team. For that he needs to look for new reference points in his game."</p>
      <p>The player's advisor said: "If he had been under my charge, I don't thinnk that he would have been so crazy to sign for Barcelona."</p>
      <p>He added that he told Griezmann to succeed he should "play in a position that suited him, but I'm not Valverde, nor do I know what he planned for him or what he told him when he was going to sign. I'm a bit sad about the situation. I knew that it would be difficult for Griezmann. I feel they sold him a project where he was going to get a position fitting his qualities and linked with Messi, but things haven't gone as planned.</p>
      <p>"I know that the problem isn't in his temperament or in his way of being, he will always try to be the most conciliatory possible. Maybe he needs to return to play in his previous position instead of on the wing."</p>
