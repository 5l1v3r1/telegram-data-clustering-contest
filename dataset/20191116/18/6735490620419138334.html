      <h1>Kate Middleton And Meghan Markle Could Bring In $2.4 Million In Influencer Value</h1>

      <p>The influence that Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle have drives thousands to the stores or online sites making them the ultimate influencers.</p>
      <p>Now the London Institute of Photography has analyzed every photo (and there is a lot) of the two Duchesses over the past year to evaluate the influencer value that comes in at $2.4 million.</p>
      <p>“The royals are talked about all the time and we wanted to see how they relate to social media and fashion,” said Damon Culbert, who led the research, told<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-influence"><i> Vanity Fair</i></a>. “Kate and Meghan are both powerful social media influences, but Meghan came out tops in our research. It’s her first year as a royal and it has been a very busy year with a marriage and the birth of Archie. It goes to show that the Duchess of Sussex’s online presence is highly valuable to audiences around the world.”</p>

      <p>Using a calculator by <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100108X1555760&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fstyle%2F2019%2F11%2Fmeghan-markle-kate-middleton-influence&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finkifi.com%2Fearnings-on-instagram%2F&amp;xguid=01DFKPCNQ5NQVCTTTC1M6BSDRK&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=480&amp;xuuid=d68918f4c317a939dadf890dcb184135">Inkifi</a>, which scores one follower as 42 cents, they figured that photos of the Duchess of Sussex had more likes than the Duchess of Cambridge across six platforms (<i>Vanity Fair, British Vogue, Elle UK, Harpers Bazaar, Grazia</i>, and <i>Tatler</i>).</p>
      <p>The 281 pictures of Meghan brought in 3.8 million likes, while Kate’s 161 pictures garnered 1.79 million likes.</p>
      <p>“From the research we have done Meghan was more influential than Kate,” Culbert said. “I think it is because Meghan has had such a big year in the spotlight and of course the birth of Archie. It’s her first full year as a duchess so there’s been more focus on her which has enabled Kate to take more of a back seat.”</p>

      <p>And while they carry a lot of influence there are celebrities who bring in way more per post (if Meghan and Kate were to actually get paid for their posts). Kylie Jenner is the highest-paid influencer earning $1.9 million a post.</p>
      <p>“The Duchesses don’t get paid for their images on social media but they are still very influential. They are able to curate their public image by how they are seen and photographed. For example Meghan opting for ethically and sustainably produced fashion,” Culbert added.</p>
