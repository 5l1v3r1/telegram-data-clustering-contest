      <h1>'Too Far Left' hashtag trends on Twitter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:21:06+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author">Marty Johnson</a></address>
      <p>The hashtag "TooFarLeft" trended on Twitter on Saturday morning, in part because of comments made Friday by former President Obama.</p>
      <p>Obama spoke at a fundraising meeting Friday evening and warned donors of the danger of the 2020 Democratic primary field moving too far to the left.</p>
      <p>"Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality," <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/470757-obama-cautions-2020-hopefuls-against-going-too-far-left">Obama said</a>. "The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it."</p>
      <p>The former president's message didn't sit well with left-leaning Democrats.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://thehill.com/people/hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> aide Peter Daou tweeted Saturday morning, "Saying 'Americans are moderate than these wild leftists' is basically conceding that the far right propaganda machine has prevailed."</p>
      <p>"Because what the Too Far Left™ movement wants is fairness and equality. Health care, education, dignity for ALL people, not just oligarchs," he continued. </p>

      <p> Daou didn't stop there, however, writing in another tweet, "I'm #TooFarLeft because I want kids to be safe in school. I'm #TooFarLeft because I want people to live in dignity. I'm #TooFarLeft because I seek justice and equality. I'm #TooFarLeft because I think healthcare and housing are human rights." That tweet caught fire, with more than 9,000 likes and almost 3,000 retweets. Daou also retweeted other tweets that used #TooFarLeft, and it quickly became the No. 1 trending hashtag on Twitter in the U.S. Some Twitter users, such as comedian Bill Burr, used the hashtag in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Burr tweeted, "I’m #toofarleft because I believe if a running back or a wide receiver lowers his head there should be no helmet to helmet penalty." </p>
