      <p>Tip #1: A new pet owner must read up on puppy care and ask the vet and other responsible pet owners on how provide the best care.  </p>
      <p>Here are other tips from the article “Puppy Care: 6 Essential Tips for Caring for Your New Dog” by Earthbath Natural Pet Care.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Find A Good Vet</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having a good vet is essential for your dog’s long-term health. Your pup needs regular check-ups and vaccinations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Create A Puppy Space</b>
      </p>
      <p>Provide a safe place for your puppy where he feels loved. “Create an area in your home with your puppy’s bedding, water and food bowls, and toys. If you’re afraid of the bowls being knocked over, keep those in your kitchen, but still close to the puppy’s bed. This allows your puppy to acclimate. Make sure he can still see you easily as he gets used to his new home, “ Earthbath shares.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Find The Right Food</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nutrients required by puppies differ from those an adult dog needs.</p>
      <p>Please buy high-quality food that was prepared specially for puppies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Make Time For Play</b>
      </p>
      <p>Puppies need time to play as they are full of energy that they have to expend.</p>
      <p>“Play time’s not only for exercise. It’s also bonding time for the two of you. Pick up several different types of toys to find out what your puppy likes best. If you have a fenced-in area in your yard, go out and play,” Earthbath says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Establish a Regular Grooming Routine</b>
      </p>
      <p>It will make your life easier if you introduce your puppy to grooming as soon as possible. Make the grooming session a fun time for your puppy.</p>
      <p>“Regular grooming should include things like teeth brushing, ear cleaning, nail trimming, brushing, and baths. Teeth should be brushed everyday with a  toothbrush or …tooth and gum wipes, and you may want to establish a weekly routine that includes ear cleaning, brushing, and bath. Nail trimming may need to be done as often as once a month,” Earthbath says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Focus On Training</b>
      </p>
      <p>You can train your puppy. The earlier, the better.</p>
      <p>Teach your pup simple commands like “stay,” “come,” and “sit.”</p>
      <p>“Be consistent, and in no time, your puppy will know what’s right and wrong for a happier and safer home,” Earthbath says.</p>
      <p>“They grow up fast, so enjoy this special time with your newest family member!,” Earthbath adds. DC</p>
