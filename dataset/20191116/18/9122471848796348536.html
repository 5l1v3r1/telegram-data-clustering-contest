      <h1>Isaiah Thomas’ Tweet About Bronny James, Zaire Wade Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:23:24+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The next generation of basketball is already getting quality exposure as ESPN will air 15 of Sierra Canyon’s games. Fans will have the chance to watch Bronny James and Zaire Wade very soon.</p>
      <p>As always, there are going to be people upset with this decision by ESPN. However, the overwhelming majority of the basketball community would like to see just how good the sons of two future Hall of Famers are.</p>
      <p>LeBron James and Dwyane Wade had an incredible bond on the hardwood, and it’s possible that their sons can create a little magic of their own.</p>
      <p>While it’s no surprise that ESPN’s decision to broadcast 15 games for Sierra Canyon certainly went viral, so did Isaiah Thomas’ reaction to the news.</p>
      <p>Thomas tweeted “Lol they got more than us.”</p>
      <p>He’s referring to the Washington Wizards’ schedule this season, which features only four nationally-televised games.</p>

      <p>This reaction seemed to be more of a joke than anything else. Besides, Thomas has respect for James since they played together in Cleveland.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s first broadcast for Sierra Canyon will take place on Nov. 21, per <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/story/2019-11-15/la-sp-sierra-canyon-basketball-tv">Eric Sondheimer of the Los Angeles Times.</a></p>
      <p>Bronny James and Zaire Wade only have one year in high school together, since the latter is graduating after this year.</p>
