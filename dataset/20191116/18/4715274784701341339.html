      <p>The track, produced under Star Music, speaks about mutual love and appreciation between lovers. It revolves around the theme of loving someone without reservations despite their flaws and insecurities. It also promotes love that sees beyond physical attributes, a relationship that looks past all imperfections.</p>
      <p>“Perfectly Imperfect” went through quite a journey, having undergone four arrangements before finally being recorded. The 16-year-old performer originally wrote it on her guitar while on her way home from a trip in Palawan when she was just 14 years old. </p>
      <p>Apart from this single, Jayda also teamed up with Indonesian artist Renn Miko earlier this year for the song “Crazy About,” her first international collaboration. Meanwhile, her first EP In My Room was released last year, followed by her stint as Niall Horan’s opening act during his Manila tour at the MOA Arena. </p>
      <p>Jayda is only one of the many talented artists under Star Music—a known home to many of the best OPM music of today from the country’s leading media and entertainment company, ABS-CBN.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, The Voice Teens alum Jeremy Glinoga has since reinvented himself and is now known as multi-talented performer Jeremy G. He now guests regularly in ASAP Natin ‘To, and was also named as one of the ambassadors of technosport Hado, which was just recently launched in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Jayda and Jeremy G’s “Perfectly Imperfect” was released on all digital platforms on Friday, Nov. 15. Catch the premiere of its music video on Star Music’s YouTube channel on Monday (Nov.18). </p>
