      <h1>Alfa Romeo Giulia Stars In Crazy Michael Bay Car Chase</h1>
      <h2>New clip for Michael Bay’s upcoming Netflix movie ‘6 Underground' is action-packed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:20:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>From 'Bad Boys 2' and 'The Rock' to the 'Transformers' movies, Michael Bay has directed some of the most destructive chases in cinema history. And now the bombastic director is making a comeback with his <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/watch-the-alfa-romeo-giulia-burn-rubber-in-michael-bays-new-movie">new Netflix movie '6 Underground.'</a> Starring Ryan Reynolds, the film is about six billionaires who fake their own deaths and form a vigilante squad to take down criminals.</p>
      <p>With a reported budget of $150 million, '6 Underground' is the most expensive Netflix film ever made, and it certainly shows when you watch the film's action-packed trailer. Of course, the standout scene for us in the trailer was a tire-shredding car chase starring the gorgeous <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia-quadrifoglio">Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio</a> tearing through the narrow streets of Florence, Italy.</p>

      <p>In the first trailer, we got a brief glimpse of the chase in a few short clips. With less than a month until the film is released on Netflix, a second trailer for '6 Underground' has dropped online. And much to our delight, the video focuses almost entirely on the film's automotive action.</p>
      <p>The trailer opens with a tongue-in-cheek tour of Florence's famous landmarks and architecture before the Giulia Quadrifoglio disturbs the peace by burning lots of rubber in the streets while being chased by several cars and motorcycles. If you don't want to look conspicuous, a sports sedan finished in bright green probably isn't a wise choice, which Ryan Reynolds' character mocks for "blending right into the Italian architecture."</p>

      <p>We get to see the sports sedan drift around monuments, crash through a museum, and damage lots of property. In one comedic scene, the Giulia narrowly avoids destroying the statue of David, much to Ryan Reynolds' character's disapproval. It also wouldn't be a Michael Bay movie without some gratuitous slow-mo shots and copious amounts of carnage. In one scene, a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/maserati/quattroporte">Maserati Quattroporte</a> crashes into the back of a van at high speed, causing it to roll over down the street in a shower of sparks.</p>
      <p>From the footage we've seen so far, we're expecting '6 Underground' to rank highly in our annual <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/best-movie-car-chases-of-2018">"best movie car chases" feature</a> later this year. '6 Underground' will stream on Netflix on December 13.</p>
