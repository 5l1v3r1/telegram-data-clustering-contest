      <h1>Plymouth Argyle beat League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers 1-0 after Antoni Sarcevic screamer</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims put in a strong defensive display to pick up maximum points at The New Lawn</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:24:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle gave further evidence of their new-found defensive resilience in the 1-0 defeat of League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Antoni Sarcevic put <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> ahead midway through the first half with a fierce shot from the edge of the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Forest Green went on to have a lot of the possession for the rest of the match but could not break down the well-drilled Argyle rearguard.</p>
      <p>Ryan Lowe's side showed the same determination which they had done in the 1-0 FA Cup first round win at Bolton Wanderers in their previous match.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Alex Palmer was given great protection by the central defensive trio of Scott Wootton, Niall Canavan and skipper Gary Sawyer.</p>
      <p>Forest Green became increasingly desperate as the game went into its closing stages.</p>
      <p>Manager Mark Cooper sent on defender Matt Mills as a late substitute to play up front and the ball was launched forward repeatedly towards him.</p>
      <p>Argyle survived a few goalmouth scrambles as they picked up their third League Two win in the last four matches.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims, who were unchanged from their victory over Bolton, had the first chance of the contest.</p>
      <p>It came in the 11th minute when striker Byron Moore saw his shot from the edge of the penalty area deflected wide for a corner after good play on the left from Danny Mayor.</p>
      <p>Forest Green ‘keeper Joe Wollacott punched clear the resulting corner and the hosts suddenly had a two-on-one break.</p>
      <p>Striker Aaron Collins charged forward and once inside the Argyle box he tried a shot but it was blocked by the retreating Joe Edwards.</p>

      <p>Collins then went to the ground under a challenge from Edwards but referee Sam Purkiss waved away Rovers’ hopeful appeals for a spot kick.</p>
      <p>The opening goal of the game came in the 24th minute and it was a screamer from Sarcevic.</p>
      <p>The Argyle midfielder played a one-two with Mayor at a short corner and then ran across the top of the penalty area with the ball.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic unleashed a fierce right-foot shot which flew high into the net past Wollacott, with the aid of a deflection off Farrend Rawson.</p>
      <p>Forest Green went close to getting an almost immediate equaliser from a free-kick taken by Joseph Mills.</p>
      <p>He curled the ball into the Pilgrims’ penalty area and it would have found its way into the far corner of the net had the alert Palmer not pushed it wide for a corer.</p>
      <p>Argyle came under pressure as the interval approached, which included six minutes of added-on time.</p>
      <p>They were able to restrict Forest Green to few clear sights of their goal with some determined defending.</p>
      <p>Joseph Mills did go close to an equaliser deep into stoppage time with a cross-shot which bounced narrowly wide of the far post.</p>
      <p>Mills did not reappear for the start of the second half as he was replaced by Nathan McGinley.</p>
      <p>Argyle manager Ryan Lowe also made a change as Callum McFadzean, who had picked up an injury before the break, made way for Joe Riley.</p>
      <p>That meant Edwards moved to left wing-back, with Riley filling the right wing-back role.</p>
      <p>Forest Green had plenty of the ball at the start of the second half, without doing much with it, and Argyle had a good chance to take a 2-0 lead in the 57th minute.</p>
      <p>Defender Niall Canavan got on the end of a corner from Sarcevic but sent his header wide of Wollacott’s right post.</p>
      <p>Riley picked up an injury in a heavy tackle with McGinley and initially was able to continue after receiving treatment from physio Paul Atkinsoin.</p>
      <p>However, after Jack Aitchison sent a shot narrowly wide for an increasingly dominant Forest Green in the 68th minute, Riley went to the ground again.</p>
      <p>Riley could not continue playing this time, with Byron Moore dropping back to right wing-back and substitute Dom Telford going up front with Joel Grant.</p>
      <p>Telford almost made his mark on the match in the 74th minute when his flicked header from a Sarcevic free-kick went narrowly wide of the far post.</p>

      <p>That chance apart, Forest Green kept up the pressure on the Pilgrims’ defence who repeatedly put their bodies on the line to frustrate the home side.</p>
      <p>Forest Green had a succession of late corners and goalmouth scrambles as they chased an equaliser.</p>
      <p>Rovers also had penalty appeals waved away by Purkiss after Palmer collided with Matt Mills inside the box as he tried to clear the ball.</p>
      <p>Eventually, after six minutes of stoppage time, Argyle could celebrate victory.</p>
