      <p>Kylie Jenner is getting ready to launch her newest makeup collection just in time for Christmas. On November 19, Kylie Cosmetics will launch the Holiday 19 collection and the 22-year-old modeled the makeup in new photos on the official Instagram account. Christmas is associated with the colors red and gold, and the new holiday kit is full of these rich holiday hues.  Kylie looked gorgeous in multiple photos where she was draped in deep-red satiny fabrics that showcased the bright-red lipstick that is the star of the collection.</p>
      <p>Kylie’s eyes were framed underneath perfectly arched, dark brows. The red colors in the collection aren’t just saved for the lips as Kylie wore the hue on her eyes blended with plenty of gold accents.  The palette features everything you need to create a perfect holiday look with metallic shades of copper, silver, gold, and burgundy with matte colors ranging from soft pink to mauve and purple with an undertone of brown.</p>
      <p>There are foil colors to ensure you get that extra glitter and sparkle needed when attending festive occasions, parties, and holiday events.</p>
