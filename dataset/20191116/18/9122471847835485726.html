      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Nebraska Cornhuskers hosted the Wisconsin Badgers in a pivotal game for both programs.</p>
      <p>Nebraska, which sits at 4-5 on the season, is in desperate need of a win to keep its bowl hopes alive. Meanwhile, Wisconsin is hoping to keep its momentum going after a lull in the middle of the season with losses to Illinois and Ohio State.</p>
      <p>The early action favored the Huskers, who jumped out to a 7-0 lead.</p>
      <p>However, the Badgers have battled back and actually took the lead on a touchdown pass from Jack Coan to wide receiver A.J. Taylor.</p>
      <p>Taylor caught a short slant pass and took it 55 yards to the house, thanks to some very poor tackling from the Nebraska secondary.</p>

      <p>Head coach Scott Frost won’t be happy with his team’s tackling on this play.</p>
      <p>The score gave Wisconsin a 24-14 lead just a few minutes before halftime. The Badgers entered the game as 14-point favorites and have looked like the better team so far this afternoon.</p>
      <p>However, Nebraska hasn’t had any trouble moving the ball either. Both teams are over 200 yards in the first half.</p>
      <p>Can the Huskers keep their offense rolling and make this interesting down the stretch?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
