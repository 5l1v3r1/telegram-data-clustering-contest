      <h1>Dumbarton 1-1 Falkirk - Last gasp penalty denies Sons three points</h1>
      <h2>In an action packed game at the C&amp;G Systems Stadium there was late heartbreak for Jim Duffy's men against the title favourites.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:56:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>There was injury time heartbreak for Dumbarton, as Isaac Layne ended a six game long goal drought - only for the Sons to have a well deserved victory snatched from their grasp by a last gasp Declan McManus penalty.</p>
      <p>Despite the nature of the equaliser however Jim Duffy refused to be too downbeat.</p>
      <p>He said: “It doesn’t feel like a defeat because the difference between the corresponding fixture is night-and-day, I’m bitterly disappointed at losing such a late goal to a contentious decision, but at the end of the day the referee saw it to give the penalty.</p>
      <p>“I think we deserved to win the game.</p>
      <p>“The only thing I wasn’t sure of was, was if it was in the box.</p>
      <p>“If it’s in the box and it hits him on the hand then the referee gives a penalty, but they are really difficult to call now; people talk about the distance between players, your hand being in an unnatural position. All those sort of things.</p>
      <p>“If it hit his hand and it’s in the box then there’s nothing we can do about it.</p>
      <p>“But the performance today shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
      <p>“We’re playing a team who really went to town on us earlier in the season, and today we were more than a match for them.</p>
      <p>“Our players stood up to be counted.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Having been hit for six the last time the teams met in August, Duffy made two changes from the Sons side which had lost to East Fife with Matthew Shiels and Stefan McCluskey dropping out for the fit-again Rico Quitongo and top scorer Layne.</p>
      <p>In a scrappy opening period it was the Bairns who had the better of the play, albeit without seriously testing Sons keeper Conor Brennan.</p>
      <p>The game was being played with an edge however, and the first flashpoint occurred after just 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Having initially awarded a throw-in, PJ Crossan and Michael Doyle clashed after the Sons winger’s strong challenge on the former Morton full-back, with referee Barry Cook electing to book both players and award the visitors a free-kick for the incident.</p>
      <p>It would be far from the last time that Cook would anger the home support, as Doyle appeared to kick out at Crossan minutes later in full view of the assistant - however he remained unmoved.</p>
      <p>That sparked some more life into the tie, with Robbie Mutch doing well to hold Ryan McGeever’s low drive before Morgaro Gomis should’ve done better than float an effort high over Brennan’s bar from a great position in the box.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t long before Sons made a breakthrough however, as former Bairn Joe McKee found space down the right and drilled in the perfect cross for Layne to stab into the empty net.</p>
      <p>That would be McKee’s last contribution as a sickness bug forced him off.</p>
      <p>There was still time for more drama before the break as Doyle looked certain to pick up a second booking for a cynical foul on Adam Frizzell as he drove towards the box, but Cook was content that a free-kick was enough punishment - leaving the home end incensed.</p>
      <p>In the second-half the visitors, who had been loudly jeered at half-time by their own support,  upped the pressure, but continued to struggle to test Sons keeper Brennan.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>At the other end meanwhile Doyle again appeared fortunate to escape a second booking after dragging down Frizzell, before Isaac Layne’s celebrations were cut short by the assistant’s flag after he turned in Stuart Carswell’s cross.</p>
      <p>And that proved a vital moment, as the Bairns drew level as the game ticked into injury time.</p>
      <p>After some last gasp Dumbarton defending the ball eventually found its way to David McMillan, with the Irishman’s blistering volley being blocked by Kyle Hutton and Cook quickly pointing to the spot for handball.</p>
      <p>Declan McManus duly stepped up and netted from the spot to ensure that Ray McKinnon’s title favourites escaped G82 with a point.</p>
