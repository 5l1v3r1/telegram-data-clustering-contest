      <p>London - Two tries from <b>Springbok</b> World Cup winner <b>Makazole Mapimpi </b>were not enough as <b>Fiji </b>recorded their first win over the <b>Barbarians</b> in 49 years winning a thrilling encounter 33-31 at Twickenham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A largely inexperienced Fijian side produced some magical rugby with man of the match flanker John Dyer scoring a brace of second-half tries to deny England head coach Eddie Jones - who took charge of the Barbarians for the game - a victorious homecoming.</p>
      <p>"This is a big win for the boys after not such a good year," said Dyer referring to Fiji's group stage exit at the World Cup.</p>
      <p>The Fijians may largely have their careers in front of them but for two of the Barbarians side their days of glory are coming to an end.</p>
      <p>Legendary Irish hooker Rory Best and iconic South African prop Tendai 'Beast' Mtawarira lasted just over 50 minutes and an hour respectively.</p>
      <p>Best will stay with the 'BaaBaas' for their remaining two games in Brazil and Wales before finally hanging up his boots.</p>
      <p>The Fijians had gone in at the break 14-12 up with both sides having scored two tries, including one for barrel-chested French centre Mathieu Bastareaud, possibly making his last appearance at Twickenham as he is moving to play for Rugby United New York.</p>
      <p>The pick of Fiji's first-half tries came from fly-half Teti Tela who wove some of his magic with a brilliant solo run before being on hand to touch down when the ball was worked back to him.</p>
      <p>Dyer and Mapimpi exchanged tries early in the second-half - the latter's considerably simpler than the one he scored in the 32-12 World Cup final victory over England earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Further Fijian tries from lock Temo Mayanavanua and Dyer, his second coming seven minutes fom the end, looked to have sealed victory.</p>
      <p>However, veteran Springbok Morne Steyn, who left Stade Francais this week to return to South Africa, sparked a late comeback.</p>
      <p>Mapimpi added a second, dotting down in the left-hand corner after a quick passing movement with both fellow World Cup winner Lukhanyo Am and the evergreen Steyn involved - Steyn converted for 33-24.</p>
      <p>Steyn, top points-scorer at the 2011 World Cup, added a try of his own with just over a minute remaining, rounding off a stunning move.</p>
      <p>He added the conversion but it came just too late to pull off a miraculous victory.</p>
