      <p>LONDON - Former Wimbledon runner-up Tomas Berdych has announced his retirement from tennis.</p>
      <p>Berdych confirmed the decision at the ATP Finals on Saturday, having hinted on social media this week that reports about his retirement were accurate.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old Czech reached the 2010 Wimbledon final, beating Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic along the way before losing to Rafael Nadal.</p>
      <p>He also reached the semifinals at least once at each of the other three Grand Slams and earned 13 career titles, with a career-high ranking of No. 4.</p>
      <p>However, he hasnâ€™t played since losing in the first round of the U.S. Open in August and is currently ranked 103rd.</p>
