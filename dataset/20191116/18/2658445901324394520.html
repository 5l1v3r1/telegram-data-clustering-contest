      <h4>Chris Oji, Enugu</h4>
      <p>Another Catholic priest has been kidnapped in Enugu State.</p>
      <p>The Parish priest of Ihuonyia Amansiodo in Ndiagu Oghe, Ezeagu Local Government Area of the State was kidnapped on his way home along Amansiodo road Friday evening.</p>
      <p>He became the 8th Catholic priest to be kidnapped in recent times.</p>
      <p>Rev Fr Ndulue was kidnapped along with one Stella Odo, about 18 days after the Deputy Rector of Queen of the Apostle Spiritual Year Seminary, Imeize Owa in Ezeagu Local Government Area of the state, Fr Arinze Madu was kidnapped at the Seminary gate on October 29.</p>
      <p>Ndulue’s kidnap has brought to eight, the number of Catholic priests abducted within the last nine months.</p>
      <p>Two of them were killed by their abductors.</p>
      <p>Enugu Catholic Communication Director, Rev. Fr. Benjamin Achi, confirmed the kidnap of Fr. Ndulue weekend.</p>

      <p>Achi said: “My brother that was the bad news we went to bed with after our meeting at the Holy Ghost Cathedral last evening,” adding that “a colleague working in that area just informed me. That’s all. No extra information.”</p>
      <p>He further said that the Church was yet to get full details of Fr. Ndulue’s abduction.</p>
      <p>Police Spokesman in Enugu State, Ebere Amaraizu, also confirmed the abduction of Rev Fr Nduluehe.</p>
      <p>Amaraizu, who spoke in a telephone interview, said that the incident took place along Amansiodo road on Friday night while the priest was driving to his Parish.</p>
      <p>According to Amaraizu, the priest was kidnapped with a woman who he identified as Stella Nwodo, who had however, been already rescued by operatives of the Operation Puff Adder, who reportedly swung into action immediately the kidnapped incident was reported.</p>
      <p>Amaraizu said that police operatives have intensified manhunt for the abductors of the priest with a view to rescuing him from the marauders.</p>
