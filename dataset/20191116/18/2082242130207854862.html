      <h3>Toronto Maple Leafs at <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/pittsburgh-penguins"><b>Pittsburgh Penguins</b></a>: 7:00 pm</h3>

      <p>What does it feel like to put all your hopes in a completely unknown commodity? Over the years, Leafs fans have had to do this when their completely unknown second, third, or fourth string goalie gets a start in the NHL. It worked out great for one <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/296913/james-reimer">James Reimer</a>, less so for Jonas Gustavsson. At the start, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/132408/garret-sparks">Garret Sparks</a> showed promise, but in front of a real team couldn’t handle the pressure. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/198383/antoine-bibeau">Antoine Bibeau</a> got an NHL start last week in Colorado, after disappointing results in Toronto.</p>
      <p>Now it’s time for <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/283108/kasimir-kaskisuo">Kasimir Kaskisuo</a>. The undrafted free agent out of college, originally from Finland, has spent five seasons now in the Leafs organization, including one year where he was loaned to the Chicago Wolves. His regular season last year was not great, but he had a hot playoffs and has carried that play into this season with the Marlies. Can he carry it into the NHL? We’ll know tonight.</p>
      <p>In front of him, the Leafs are in a bit of a trouble spot. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/298190/mitchell-marner">Mitchell Marner</a>, Alexander Kerfoot, and Trevor Moore are all injured and the third line is looking a lot more like a fourth line every game. At least the defense is fully intact?</p>
      <p>The Leafs never called a spare up from the Toronto Marlies, despite both teams being in the city on Friday night, so the Leafs are in Pittsburgh with exactly 12 forwards, seven defensemen, and two goalies, despite <a href="https://www.capfriendly.com/teams/mapleleafs">upwards of $9 million in cap flexibility</a> with Marner on LTIR.</p>
      <p>It’s a risky move with not much reward. The Marlies have plenty of depth available to them at forward, and if someone happens to get injured in warmups, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/318663/martin-marincin">Martin Marincin</a> is playing as the seventh defenseman or on the wing. I’d like to know the explanation behind that.</p>

They also don’t have <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/296690/patric-hornqvist">Patric Hornqvist</a>, or <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/296701/kris-letang">Kris Letang</a>.

Oh, and that <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/296706/evgeni-malkin">Malkin</a> guy.</p>
      <p>The Penguins played last night to a 2-1 loss to the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/teams/new-jersey-devils">New Jersey Devils</a>. <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/157284/matthew-murray">Matt Murray</a> was in net for that one, meaning <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/players/198367/tristan-jarry">Tristan Jarry</a> (who was on waivers at an earlier point in the season) will get the start tonight against Toronto.</p>

      <p>Please, Kaz, win this one and start a goaltending controversy in Toronto. It’s all I ever wanted.</p>
