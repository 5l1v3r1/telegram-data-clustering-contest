      <h1>Andy Cohen Announces New Housewife Franchise At BravoCon – Which City Did Producers Choose?</h1>

      <p>Bravo’s <i>Housewife</i> franchise is officially adding a new city! <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/andy-cohen-reveals-the-secret-behind-his-recent-weight-loss-338418/">Andy Cohen</a> announced this weekend at the network’s first-ever convention titled BravoCon, that the <i>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</i> are coming soon, and they will make the network “a whole lot saltier.”</p>
      <p>Cohen said that they have always tried to choose a city that has completely unique personalities, and they also try to “throw a little curve ball now and then.” Cohen didn’t think fans were expecting a location like Salt Lake City, and that’s exactly why they chose it.</p>

      <p>“You didn’t see it coming but I have to tell you, in Utah, you have the majesty of the mountains, the Mormon religion, an exclusive community of people who have very successful businesses who live in their own universe,” he said. “It is gorgeous and I think you’re going to be really surprised and intrigued by the group of women we’ve found.”</p>
      <p>Salt Lake City will join a thriving reality franchise that Bravo kicked off in 2006 with the <i>Real Housewives of Orange County.</i> Two years later, the network added the <i>Real Housewives of New York</i> and the <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i>, and in 2009, the <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> premiered.</p>
      <p>The network introduced the <i>Real Housewives of D.C</i> and the <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> in 2010, and the following year came the <i>Real Housewives of Miami</i>. Finally, in 2016 came the <i>Real Housewives of Potomac</i> and the <i>Real Housewives of Dallas.</i></p>
      <p>Every one of those shows is still on the air, except for Miami and D.C., making it clear that fans can’t get enough of the franchise.</p>
      <p>According to <i>People Magazine</i>, Bravo’s official announcement says that <i>RHOSL</i> takes viewers into an undiscovered world that is about more than religion. However, there is no doubt that the Mormon church is ingrained into the culture. The network says that Utah’s majestic mountains hide a social circle made up of successful women who have created their own paradise filled with multi-million dollar business and brands, shopping sprees, and luxury homes.</p>

      <p>Having the Sundance Film Festival in the area every year brings the A-listers to town, and “what party list you are on means everything.” The statement wraps up by saying that the women run successful enterprises by day, and enjoy après ski at the finest resorts by night. And, the ladies do all of this while “raising extraordinary and unconventional families.”</p>
      <p>“Here perfection is not an aspiration, it’s a mandate,” says Bravo. “They hold themselves and each other to an extremely high standard and never hold back when things go sideways, but lord knows they are always there for each other when they need it most.”</p>
      <p>Andy Cohen did not announce a premiere date for <i>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</i>, but it will most likely come sometime in 2020.</p>
