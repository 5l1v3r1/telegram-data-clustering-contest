      <h1>Carl Froch makes bold claim about Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin</h1>
      <h2>The retired multiple super-middleweight world champion didn't face either fighter during his distinguished career, but predicted who he believes would have won</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:27:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:27</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/carl-froch">Carl Froch</a> went down as one of Britain's most successful boxers in history when he retired in 2014.</p>
      <p>A multiple world champion at super-middleweight, a sell-out crowd at Wembley stadium, and just two losses in a thrilling 35-fight career.</p>
      <p>He avenged one defeat against Mikkel Kessler towards the end of his time in the ring, while the other came at the hands of one of the greatest boxers of his generation, Andre Ward.</p>
      <p>Needless to say there were few who got the better of Froch in his pomp, although several have questioned how he would fare against the current leading stars of his division, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gennady-golovkin">Gennady 'GGG' Golovkin</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/saul-alvarez">Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez</a> .</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Froch - who once claimed he was "too big and too strong for GGG" - has his own theory.</p>

      <p>"Too big, too strong," Froch said on his podcast. "Jokes aside, when I watched Canelo fight Kovalev I just wasn't impressed.</p>
      <p>“I thought it was close, but I thought he was losing. At that weight he's slower. He reminded me of Arthur Abraham when I fought Abraham.</p>
      <p>“I just kept him long with a jab, met him with combinations, and absolutely hammered him for 12 rounds. It was a flawless victory.</p>

      <p>“I feel like I would have been able to do that to Canelo when he fought Canelo, that version of Canelo."</p>
      <p>Froch a.k.a 'The Cobra' finished his career with two fights for the ages against George Groves, whom he stopped in the first meeting, before scoring a eighth-round knockout at Wembley in his final bout.</p>
      <p>Prior to his finale, Froch admitted he would "swerve Golovkin like the plague," but has since changed his tune.</p>

      <p>He added: "I'd have been too much for him. I met him and he's 5ft 9in or 5ft 10in.</p>
      <p>"When I meet someone and shaking their hand, and looking in their eyes.</p>
      <p>“I might be wrong, but me as a fighter and the warrior I was when I was fighting,</p>
      <p>"I was shaping and sizing him up, thinking, 'If I ever fight you, no problem, end of the jab, walk you into some shots, I'd be too much for you.'</p>
      <p>"He went 11 rounds with Martin Murray. At that sort of level, you're not going to give me a problem.”</p>
