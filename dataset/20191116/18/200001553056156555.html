      <h1>Everton pushing for striker move in January – Club want €20m, Brands already working on deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:07:02+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/sean-lunt/" target="_blank">Sean Lunt</a></address>
      <p>Everton are keen on a move for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Gonçalo Paciência in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Blues have struggled for goals this season, with Moise Kean yet to open his account and both Cenk Tosun and Dominic Calvert-Lewin hardly specific.</p>
      <p>It has sparked suggestions they may look to add extra firepower in January, and it seems they have their sights set on Paciência.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/detalhe/goncalo-paciencia-na-mira-do-everton?ref=HP_1BucketDestaquesPrincipais">Record</a>, Everton manager Marco Silva has made the 25-year-old striker one the club’s <i>‘priority targets’</i> for January.</p>
      <p>The Blues are already pushing ahead with the move, as Director of Football Marcel Brands is talking with the German club to try and find a way to get a deal done.</p>
      <p>They are not exactly keen to lose Paciência, who has nine goals in 23 games in all competitions this season, although they do have back up should they lose him.</p>
      <p>Everton want to pay around €15m but Frankfurt value the striker more around the €20m mark, which is not an impossible difference to make up by any means.</p>

      <p>While his club aren’t keen, Paciência is. Record says he earns a <i>‘low salary’</i> in Germany so would welcome the move to Liverpool, especially as Marco Silva is also at the club.</p>
      <p>He also fancies his chances of being a regular in the team given Everton’s current attacking options, further suggesting he could push for a move.</p>
