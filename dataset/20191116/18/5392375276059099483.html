Well, those rumours have been finally sealed off today with a <a href="https://twitter.com/s_anuj/status/1195528011035971584?s=20">tweet</a> by none other than Anuj Sharma, CMO of Xiaomi India early this morning.

      <p>According to Xiaomishka, there is a new mystery Xiaomi smartphone with model numbers M1912G7BE and M1912G7BC respectively as indicated by 3C listing. He also noted the device to be a new version of already available Redmi Note 8 Pro with Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G instead of MediaTek Helio G90T. But now as it has been denied by a Xiaomi executive, the exact identity of the device becomes another mystery. </p>
      <p>Some rumours suggest it could be the most-awaited POCO F2 but the original POCO F1 was not available in China and it was targeted at international markets. Hence, the chances of it to be the next POCO is next to zero. c / Mi Note 10 from Xiaomi.</p>
      <p>As of now, we do not know about the launch period of this mystery phone until new leaks or teasers emerge on the web. However, we’ll keep our eyes on this device for future developments. </p>
