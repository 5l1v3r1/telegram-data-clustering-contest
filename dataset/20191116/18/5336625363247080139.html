      <h1>A rich white guy reclaimed his 'richest person' title, but we all still lose</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:49:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/rachel-kraus/" target="_blank">Rachel Kraus</a></address>
      <p>The two-way race for which white tech man has the most unfathomable amount of money seesawed again on Friday. </p>
      <p>Jeff Bezos has led the pack for most of 2019 as the richest rich guy, with about $110 billion in the bank. Nipping at his sumptuously adorned heels has been Bill Gates, a grandfatherly-seeming nice guy philanthropist who was also known as a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/gates-is-a-ruthless-schemer-says-his-microsoft-co-founder-2257843.html">"ruthless schemer"</a> in his heyday as Microsoft CEO. Gates' fortunate has hovered around a paltry $107 billion.</p>
      <p>But lo, the tables have turned! Gates overtook Bezos at the close of trading on Friday to become the world's richest man. Gates is currently worth $110 billion, while Bezos is counting his ducats at $109 billion. </p>
      <p>Net worth fluctuates on a daily basis because a lot of these guys' financial value is tied to the massive amounts of stock they have in their various corporations — and stock prices change. Bloomberg keeps track of it all at the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>, which it updates at the close of trading every day. </p>
      <p>Thanks to a bump in Microsoft stock, and a decline in Amazon stock, Bezos and Gates traded places on the list in the one and two spots. The stock changes were likely in response to the Pentagon <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/10/25/microsoft-wins-10-billion-pentagon-cloud-contract-beating-amazon/">awarding Microsoft</a> a $10 billion cloud computing contract, which meant that Amazon's cloud arm, Amazon World Service (AWS), missed out on that government cashola. Bezos himself lost $845 million in a single day.</p>
      <p>Jeff Bezos takes a lot of flak as a tight-pursed capitalist, and for good reason. In 2018, when Amazon stock soared, he became the richest person in history with a net worth of $150 billion. At the same time, his company <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/7-examples-how-amazon-treats-their-90000-warehouse.html">is notorious</a> for squeezing productivity out of its workers at the expense of workers' rights and well-being. </p>
      <p>And personally, Bezos has conspicuously not signed The Giving Pledge — the billionaire promise to give away half of your wealth — while many of his contemporaries have. (In a spectacular move of petty charitability, ex-wife Mackenzie Bezos <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mackenzie-bezos-giving-pledge/">signed on to the pledge</a> almost as soon as her divorce from Jeff was finalized).</p>
      <p>Gates, on the other hand, is seen as the archetypical charitable billionaire. The Gates Foundation is the world's largest philanthropy, and it has championed the issue of curing the world's most in-need places of malaria. Gates even helped found The Giving Pledge, alongside Warren Buffett, and is himself a signee. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, Gates' fortune got <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/us/politics/bill-gates-elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax.html">some uncommon scrutiny</a> in November when he criticized presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and her proposed "wealth tax." Gates said that he would be happy to pay an additional $10 billion in taxes, but that he would be concerned if she taxed $100 billion. </p>
      <p>That's not the wealth tax figure: Warren proposes a six percent tax on households worth over $1 billion. But the internet (and Bernie Sanders) were quick to point out that, even with $100 billion in taxes, Gates would still have several billion left over.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth Warren also invited Gates to have a conversation and explain her plan. </p>

      <p>Can anyone be an ethical billionaire? Gates has made the case for it. But even as he pledges away his fortune, he just keeps getting richer. </p>
