      <p>Justin’s (James Stewart) daughter Ava (Alice Roberts) has been staying in Summer Bay while Nina (Zoe Naylor) and Brian (Tom O’Sullivan) navigate a messy divorce, but Ava’s turbulent mood has left Justin and Leah (Ada Nicodemou) worried that something more could be going on than his daughter is telling them.</p>
      <p>In the morning, Ava’s phone rings, and Justin sees it’s Brian. He encourages her to talk to her stepdad, but she brushes it off, saying she’ll call him later.</p>

      <p>Justin finds out Nina has been telling Ava to avoid Brian’s calls, and swiftly steps in to intercept the call. He tells Nina that she needs to be protecting their daughter from her marriage drama, not dragging her into them.</p>
      <p>He hangs up and tells Ava none of the situation is her fault. Then he decides he will do whatever it takes to make his daughter feel safe and secure – once he’s worked out how…</p>
