      <p>For basketball fans longing for the LeBron James-and-Dwyane-Wade era of the Miami Heat, ESPN is broadcasting the next best thing.</p>
      <p>Sierra Canyon High School – where freshmen Bronny James and Zaire Wade play – will play on ESPN’s network of channels 15 times this season, more than some NBA teams.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/story/2019-11-15/la-sp-sierra-canyon-basketball-tv">reports</a> that ESPN will be airing the games on November 21. A school spokesperson told the Times that the contract is confidential, but the network is paying the school for the right to show the games.</p>
      <p>Washington Wizards point guard Isaiah Thomas posted his reply to the news on Twitter, writing that the high school team “got more than us.” The team is slated for only four nationally televised games, including only one ESPN game.</p>

      <p>Bronny and Zaire might not play too much – <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/video-bronny-james-first-dunk-sierra-canyon-lebron-james-2019-10">even though Bronny is dunking now</a> – thanks to the loaded roster at Sierra Canyon. One of the top recruits in the senior class, <a href="https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2020/ziaire-williams-208765">Zaire Williams</a>, leads the deep team, which ranked number eight in the country.</p>
      <p>Other players include the University of Kentucky commit <a href="https://n.rivals.com/prospect_rankings/rivals150/2020?position=SG">BJ Boston</a>, TCU recruit Terren Frank, and one-time UCLA commit Amari Bailey.</p>
