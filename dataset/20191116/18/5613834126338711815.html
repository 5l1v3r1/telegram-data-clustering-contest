      <h1>You Can Get a Free Prequel Comic With Physical Copies of ‘Terminator Resistance’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:48:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/harrison-abbott/" target="_blank">Harrison Abbott</a></address>
      <p>Although the North American console port of <b><i>Terminator: Resistance </i></b>is <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3592440/terminator-resistance-receives-new-gameplay-video-trailer-delayed-north-america-release/">slated for release in December</a>, European players can pick it up right now on the Xbox One and PS4. Should they choose to purchase a physical copy of Reef Entertainment’s latest, then they will be treated to a free bonus: in the form of an exclusive digital comics bundle. </p>
      <p>Acting as a prequel expansion, <b><i>Zero-Day Exploit</i></b> is a two-partner from <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/comics/3592278/exploring-alternate-worlds-many-terminator-comics/">Dark Horse comics</a> that introduce key narrative threads that will reverberate throughout <i>Terminator: Resistance</i>. The first installment focuses on Commander Jessica Baron – inspiring leader of the resistance south division – whilst the second revolves around Dr. Edwin Mack, a disgraced scientist who is familiar with the inner workings of SKYNET. Both of these characters will in some way leave their mark on the licenced game, so if you want a little more context for their backstories and motivations, then <i>Zero Day Exploit</i> should be right up your street. </p>
      <p>To read the series, you’ll need a unique code which can only be found in physical copies of the game. You’ll then need to head to <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/f19240f907444258/Documents/digital.darkhorse.com">digital.darkhorse.com</a> in order to redeem it and access the bundle. </p>
      <p><i>Terminator: Resistance</i> was released on Steam on 15th November 15 and is available on consoles in Europe. Meanwhile, the PS4 and Xbox One versions will make their North American debut on 10th December. </p>
