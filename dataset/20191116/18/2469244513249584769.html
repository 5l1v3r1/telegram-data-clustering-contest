      <p>All the closures on the southbound stretch of the <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/m5">M5 </a>between junction 22 and 23 have now been lifted, although delays are expected.</p>
      <p>Highways England tweeted at around 4.30pm that they still expected "delays of at least 90 minutes" on the approach to junction 22 while the jams on local routes were beginning to ease.</p>
      <p>Motorists endured up to <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/six-miles-traffic-m5-drivers-3546200">five hours and six miles of jams following a collision shortly before 6am today</a>.</p>
      <p>It follows two crashes on the M5, one of which left a woman with serious head injuries after the car she was driving collided with a lorry and became wedged underneath it.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on the Southbound carriageway around 6am and firefighters had to cut the woman out of her car before she was taken to hospital.</p>

      <p>The second incident happened between Junctions 18 and 17 Northbound and saw a car end up on its roof.</p>

      <p>"We would like to hear from anyone who has dashcam footage of the collision to contact us ref 5219265362"</p>
