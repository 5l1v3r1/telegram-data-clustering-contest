      <h1>Bristol Bears run in eight tries as they thrash Zebre Rugby in the European Challenge Cup</h1>
      <h2>Ioan Lloyd was named man of the match on his first start at fly-half</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:28:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Evans</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Bears blew away Zebre to kick-start their European Challenge Cup campaign, but their performance at Ashton Gate was far from perfect.</p>
      <p>The hosts plundered eight converted tries and a penalty as they delivered a 59-21 bonus-point win against the Pro14 club from Italy.</p>
      <p>But a prolonged lull in the second half saw Ed Holmes and his replacement, James Dun, sin-binned before referee Ludovic Cayre awarded a penalty try as the visiting scrum rumbled forward.</p>
      <p>In truth, the contest was over long before then but it took some of the gloss off this thrashing and left Bears DoR Pat Lam with plenty of ammunition to fire into the coming week’s preparation for Brive away.</p>
      <p>An entertaining first-half was sprinkled with offloads, footwork and flashes of skill.</p>
      <p>Zebre were the first to show their creative side; keeping the ball alive as they attacked – with some success – from deep in the opening ten minutes.</p>
      <p>Dan Thomas put in a big hit and thought he had won a turnover, but the spilled ball had actually gone forward off his hand.</p>
      <p>Wing Mattia Bellini reacted quickest, scooped it up, weaved past two would-be tacklers and scored the opening, converted try under the posts with seven minutes on the clock.</p>
      <p>Academy product Will Capon - making his first senior start for Bristol at hooker - burrowed over from close range before Toby Fricker was there in support to finish off some beautiful handling from sharp-looking Charles Piutau and Chris Vui down the left touchline.</p>

      <p>Piers O’Conor goose-stepped his way through the defence and showed his pace to secure the hosts' third try.</p>
      <p>To watch Ioan Lloyd's flawless display, one would never have guessed it was the 18-year-old's maiden start as the first-team fly-half. He slotted all seven of his conversions and a penalty, including some rather tricky shots at goal.</p>
      <p>The deserved man of the match got the backs outside him moving well, covered well at full-back once Callum Sheedy came on and showed, once again, he has a keen eye for the tryline.</p>
      <p>After a scrappy passage of play in the 25th minute, the former Clifton College pupil scooped up the ball 60m out, pierced the Zebre defence and had the pace to finish and secure the four-try bonus point.</p>

      <p>Dan Thomas’ nifty side-step and burrowing effort on the stroke of half time put the hosts well and truly in command. They were leading 38-7 and cruising.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bears </a> mixed it up early in the second half and Yann Thomas finished off a driving maul. Then they came off the rails for 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Zebre edged their way into the game, thanks in large part to their hosts indiscipline and mistakes.</p>
      <p>Flanker Maxime Mbanda barged his way over and when the penalty try was awarded in the 73rd minute after Dun had been binned for an off-the-ball tackle, Zebre were winning the second period.</p>
      <p>The Bears regathered and finished with a flourish. Replacement centre Charlie Powell glided through a gap and substitute scrum-half Andy Uren wriggled his way over to add some icing to the result which sends the Bears top of Pool 4 after round one.</p>
