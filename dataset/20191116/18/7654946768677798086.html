      <h1>The shocking foods your kids are eating at school</h1>

      <p>A slice of Domino’s “Hawaiian Hot Lava” pizza dotted with ham, bacon, jalapenos, hot sauce and mozzarella isn’t most people’s idea of a healthy kid’s meal. And yet the fast-food giant has been delivering to school districts for years.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2011, the Domino’s Smart Slice program now supplies lunches to schools in 47 states including New York (though not New York City). And while slices boast whole-grain crusts and “light mozzarella cheese” to comply with USDA standards, they’re still heavily branded as Domino’s. Districts can even take part in a rewards program offering Domino’s hats, posters and gift cards.</p>
      <p>Fast food has increasingly crept into public schools as they struggle to feed kids on a diminished federal budget. In many districts, the Walking Taco — a meal of chili and cheese served on a bed of Doritos chips — has become a staple. Papa John’s, Little Caesars and Pizza Hut also supply school lunches. And New York City students regularly enjoy Jamaican beef patties from local chain Golden Krust.</p>
      <p>“We’re still teaching kids on a daily basis that foods branded with the names Pop-Tart, Cheetos, Funyuns and Domino’s are things that they can and should eat every day,” says Bettina Elias Siegel.</p>
      <p>In her new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0190862122?pf_rd_p=183f5289-9dc0-416f-942e-e8f213ef368b&amp;pf_rd_r=JXWX253XXKT689JXVWVN&amp;tag=nypost-20">Kid Food: The Challenge of Feeding Children in a Highly Processed World</a>” (Oxford University Press), out now, Siegel reveals how our kids are consuming unhealthy food in their own school cafeterias.</p>
      <p>A mother of two and lawyer turned food-policy advocate, Siegel successfully petitioned the USDA in 2012 to stop providing schools with ground meat containing “lean, finely textured beef” — the easily contaminated slaughterhouse scraps known as “pink slime.”</p>
      <p>After gathering more than a quarter of a million signatures and a good deal of media attention, the USDA changed its policy, but Siegel says there’s still a lot to be done when it comes to improving kids’ meals at school.</p>

      <p>“Too many American kids are . . . being served a lot of highly processed food in carnival-style menus that only reinforce poor eating habits outside of school,” she writes.</p>
      <p>Prior to the 1970s, school lunches typically consisted of homestyle fare. As a child, Siegel remembers a lunch tray filled with meatloaf, green beans and fruit cocktail. Things shifted in the early and mid-1970s, when, in an effort to curtail food waste, children were first allowed to select three components of their lunch from five options, putting them in the driver’s seat. Those changes along with federal dollars being drastically cut — in 1981, the Reagan administration slashed school-lunch funding by $1.5 billion — dramatically altered the menu. Districts typically now have just $1 per child per meal to spend on food costs, while tasty, inexpensive fare such as pizza and corn dogs dominate.</p>
      <p>“These profound shifts are evident in today’s school menus,” Siegel writes.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Congress passed the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, spearheaded by Michelle Obama. The legislation strengthened nutritional guidelines — more fruits, veggies and whole grains; less sodium and saturated fats — for all food sold in schools and boosted federal funding for schools that met the new standards.</p>
      <p>“School meals were significantly improved by the new law. And since the majority of the 30 million kids who regularly eat those meals are economically disadvantaged, those changes were all the more critical,” Siegel writes. “But I’d also be lying if I told you America’s school food is now exactly where it should be.”</p>
      <aside>‘Cheese, flour and tomato paste wind up being served to kids in the form of a Conagra frozen pizza.’</aside>
      <p>Big Food has a long and ongoing history of skirting the rules. In 2011, new USDA standards tried to reduce the amount of white potatoes served in school lunches, but potato farmers successfully lobbied against them. And when dried sweetened cranberries were deemed too sugary, cranberry growers did the same. Now an exemption allows dried fruit with added sugar for “processing and/or palatability purposes.” Raisins pumped full of citric acid and coated in sugar so they taste like candy are also allowed under this exemption.</p>
      <p>The rules can be twisted in ways that I don’t think match the intent of those rules,” Siegel says.</p>
      <p>Fruit or vegetable juices are allowed as a substitute for actual fruit and veggies for half of the school week. Even frozen juice desserts can be used to satisfy nutrition requirements. “They’ll be bright blue or bright green,” she says. “They look exactly like a frozen sherbet or sorbet.”</p>
      <p>After the USDA tried to close a loophole allowing schools to count 2 tablespoons of tomato paste on a pizza slice as an entire serving of vegetables, a group called the Coalition for Sustainable School Meal Programs — backed by major food conglomerates such as Conagra and Schwan’s — “vigorously lobbied” against the measure in 2011. Their campaign was successful.</p>
      <p>It was yet another “jarring example of the industry putting profits over kids’ health,” Siegel writes.</p>

      <p>School breakfasts are often worse than lunches, as they’re not required to contain a protein or vegetable. (They must offer fruit, whole grains, low-fat and nonfat milks, while sodium is limited and trans fats are banned.)</p>
      <p>Last year, in Broward County, Florida, an elementary-school student could opt for a breakfast of sweetened yogurt with “chocolate crisps,” dried cranberries and chocolate milk, Siegel writes. (New York City is currently considering banning flavored milk.) Such a meal contains nearly 14 teaspoons of sugar, more than double the recommended daily amount for a child. According the USDA, nearly 15 million kids are served a school breakfast each day.</p>
      <p>Why don’t schools just scrap their Big Food contracts and make meals from scratch? When they do, they face numerous obstacles. Roughly 20 percent of the ingredients in school lunches are considered “agriculture commodities,” such as grain or frozen produce, which are provided for free. But these commodities also require trained workers and equipment to be properly prepared, two things many schools lack.</p>
      <p>In 2014, the Pew Charitable Trust surveyed US schools about what they needed to prepare better meals. Eighty-eight percent said they lacked basic equipment like knives and scales. Without these resources, it’s no wonder cafeterias often end up serving convenience foods.</p>
      <p>“If you just have to put frozen chicken nuggets in a convection oven, you don’t need a lot of labor, you don’t need skilled labor,” Siegel says. “But if you’re asking people to wash and chop and prepare fresh food or to prepare raw poultry, which is a dicey proposition from a food-safety perspective, then you need skilled labor. And in many places, districts simply can’t afford enough skilled labor for scratch cooking.”</p>

      <p>Siegel estimates roughly 50 percent of these staples are sent to outside manufacturers to prepare, including companies like Kraft Heinz and Del Monte. The raw ingredients that were supposed to be used to cook wholesome meals are often turned into processed foods. “Commodity chicken in the hands of Tyson becomes a breaded nugget or fried-chicken sandwich,” Siegel writes, “while commodity cheese, flour and tomato paste wind up being served to kids in the form of a Conagra frozen pizza.”</p>
      <p>Another issue driving unhealthy eating, Siegel and many others believe, is that lunch periods today are shorter in the face of budget constraints, limited cafeteria space and a push for more academic time to raise test scores.</p>
      <p>Children sometimes have just 20 minutes in total to line up, move through the cafeteria queue, find a seat, socialize and actually eat. With such time constraints, it’s much easier to shove down a piece of pizza than it is to nibble on a chicken breast and some salad. Younger kids often have lunch before recess, but studies have shown that kids who eat after playing are more willing to consume fruits and vegetables.</p>
      <p>Given that tens of millions of kids, many of them from low-income households, rely on school meals, it’s crucial that they be improved, Siegel says. Parents need to advocate for longer lunch periods and more money for schools to prepare healthier fare, so that meals like the Walking Taco keep on walking out the door.</p>
      <p>“We can all do better by our children,” Siegel writes. “We must.”</p>
