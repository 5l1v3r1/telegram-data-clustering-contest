      <h2>Walsall boss Darrell Clarke has praised his side's 'battling' performance after a 2-1 home win over Cambridge United.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:14:13+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The result brought to an end a six-game losing league streak for the Saddlers, who impressed throughout the performance.</p>
      <p>Josh Gordon got off the mark within a minute, before Mat Sadler headed home after 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Harvey Knibbs pulled one back for Cambridge in injury time, but the Saddlers hung on for the victory.</p>
      <p>They came up against a physical United side and Clarke was pleased with his side's dogged determination.</p>
      <p>“I thought it was a really entertaining game to watch to be honest," he said.</p>
      <p>“Just, the lads like to take years off my life as a manager by conceding the goal.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had umpteen opportunities on the counter-attack in the second half.</p>
      <p>“But I thought my players stood up to it well today, battled well, worked hard.</p>
      <p>“We got the initiative early in the game, which was pleasing to see and that gets your fans behind you.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I’m talking about at home, if you can start bright.</p>
      <p>“Our fans have been great this season and they’ll get behind you when you score that early goal."</p>
      <p>Several players kept their place in the side after Tuesday's 6-0 EFL Trophy win over Forest Green Rovers.</p>
      <p>And Clarke said he must use his full squad in a busy period for the club.</p>
      <p>“There’s a couple who were unfortunate to be honest and didn’t retain it," he added.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a big week for the football club and it’s a great start.</p>
      <p>“Another big game on Wednesday in the FA Cup so squads are important.</p>
      <p>“Some of the players aren’t at the stage for me where they can play three games in a week and we have to make sure we utilise the squad and have belief in the squad.</p>
      <p>“We have to make sure we keep building on these last two results."</p>
