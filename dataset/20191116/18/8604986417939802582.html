      <h1>How To Totally Own a Passive-Aggressive Coworker</h1>
      <h2>You can totally turn the table when a passive-aggressive coworker pulls this common email trick.</h2>

      <p>I recently read an article (I can't remember where) pointing out that the most common passive-aggressive behavior in the workplace is CCing the recipient's boss on emails that could just as easily been handled without bringing that boss into the conversation.</p>
      <p>Indeed, CCing the boss on an email is classic passive-aggression.</p>
      <p>Without being explicit (that's the passive-aggressive part) your <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/the-best-ways-to-interrupt-a-coworker.html">coworker</a> is 1) implying that you can't be trusted to deliver/respond without supervision and 2) positioning themselves as your de facto supervisor, allied with your boss to ensure that you deliver/respond.</p>
      <p>Your passive-aggressive coworker has put you into a "heads they win, tails you lose" situation because you have two basic choices as the conversation continues:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Continue to CC your boss. </i>If you do this, you're implicitly admitting that the sender's assessment of you is correct and that you lack the authority and/or credibility to continue without your boss looking over your shoulder. (Heads, they win.)</li>
        <li><i>Don't CC your boss on your response.</i> You are now at the mercy of the passive-aggressor, because if their response to your response again CCs your boss, it looks like you wanted to hide something from your boss. (Tails, you lose.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Not to worry. When find yourself in this situation, there's a third approach that turns the tables. You forward the CCed email to your boss (and CC your coworker) this short question: "Do you want to be looped in on this?"</p>
      <p>To be perfectly clear, you are NOT responding to the passive-aggressive email. In fact, you're not going to respond to the passive-aggressive email until you get an email from your boss communicating their preference.</p>
      <p>Here's why this is so effective:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You've implicitly called into question the passive-aggressor's judgment.</li>
        <li>You've established you're confident in your ability to operate without supervision.</li>
        <li>You've protected yourself if it turns out that your boss DOES want to be looped in.</li>
        <li>You've turned their power play against you into a power play against them.</li>
        <li>You've called out the passive-aggressive behavior thus making it less likely to recur.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short, you end up looking like a straight-shooter who respects your boss's time and attention and your coworker ends up looking like a dumb schmuck who fumbled a power play.</p>
      <h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Original Email:</b>
      </p>
      <p>FROM: Coworker<br/>TO: You<br/>CC: Your boss<br/>SUBJECT: Project Status<br/>Can you please give me an update on the yada-yada-yada...</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wrong Response:</b>
      </p>
      <p>FROM: You<br/>TO: Coworker<br/>CC: Your boss<br/>SUBJECT: Re: Project Status<br/>The current status of the project is yada-yada-yada.</p>
      <p><b>Correct Response:</b><br/>FROM: You<br/>TO: Your boss<br/>CC: Coworker<br/>SUBJECT: Quick question<br/>Do you want to be looped in on this?<br/>    FROM: Coworker<br/>    TO: You<br/>    CC: Your boss<br/>    SUBJECT: Project Status<br/>    Can you please give me an update on the yada-yada-yada...</p>
