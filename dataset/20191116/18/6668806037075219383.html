      <p>Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar are two actors that have a pretty successful track record at the box-office when paired together. Bhumi made her Bollywood debut opposite Ayushmann in Dum Laga Ke Haisha in 2015. Since then the two have been paired in two films which also managed to impress at the box-office.</p>

      <p>In an interview with a leading daily, Bhumi Pednekar revealed that she considers her pairing with Ayushmann to be ‘fortunate’. She said, “Ayushmann and I are definitely a fortunate on-screen jodi to be getting so much love and adulation for audiences. We complement each other as artistes and we do have a very good on-screen chemistry. It just shows and I'm just glad that people have loved us as a pair and we have just done three films together. "From 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha' (dealing with body shaming) to 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan' (about erectile dysfunction) to 'Bala' (about premature balding and the stereotyping that dark-skinned women face in India), we have only been paired in films that tackle taboo topics so I think the equity of our pairing lies in bringing out real, societal issues told in the most honest and entertaining manner possible.”<br/><br/>Directed by Amar Kaushik, Bala is a film that revolves around a man suffering from premature baldness. It successfully portrays how we’re obsessed with physical appearances as a society.</p>
