      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/aston-villa-fc/">Aston Villa</a> will refuse to sell John McGinn to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> unless the Red Devils lodge a mammoth offer, according to reports.</p>
      <p>McGinn is a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/20/dean-smith-sends-message-manchester-united-50m-john-mcginn-pursuit-10950105/">top target for United</a>, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer earmarking the 25-year-old as the perfect man to add to his midfield.</p>
      <p>United are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/manchester-united-transfer-news-man-utd-erling-haaland-january-11165800/">ready to spend in the winter transfer window</a>, but the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/mcginn-villa-transfer-man-utd-17089754?_ga=2.234842782.102848659.1573925584-1626070328.1570958217">Birmingham Mail</a> claim Villa have almost no interest in offloading McGinn in January.</p>
      <p>Villa are battling for Premier League survival this season and McGinn is an integral part of Dean Smith’s side.</p>

      <p>If United make formal contact to sign McGinn, Villa will insist the Scotland international is not for sale.</p>
      <p>Only an offer of ‘epic proportion’ will convince Villa to cash in, with the club in a strong position to snub interest.</p>

      <p>McGinn is just a few months into the five-year contract he signed before the new campaign.</p>
      <p>Villa value McGinn around the £50million mark and remain optimistic that he will stay at Villa Park beyond the end of the current season.</p>

      <p>United are determined to land Solskjaer’s top targets, but are conscious about spending over the odds in January.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are tipped to make formal enquiries about the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/manchester-united-transfer-january-signings-jadon-sancho-erling-haaland-liverpool-11165252/">availability of Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho and RB Salzburg’s Erling Haaland</a>.</p>
      <p>United are in desperate need of reinforcements up front and there is expected to be at least one addition in the forward department when the winter window opens.</p>
