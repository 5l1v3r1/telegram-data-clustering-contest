      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news | The January transfer window is just around the corner, and plenty of players are being linked with a move to the Premier League and to Villa Park next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:55:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack, Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa continue to be linked with Glasgow Rangers striker <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> .</p>
      <p>The Colombian international has been frequently tipped to sign for Dean Smith’s side in the upcoming January transfer window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> currently have summer recruit Wesley as the club’s first-choice striker, after the Brazilian signed for a fee of £22m from Club Brugge.</p>
      <p>It is no surprise to see Morelos linked with a move to England, given his recent comments about being interested in signing for a club south of the border.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The former HJK Helsinki man netted his 22nd goal in 26 matches on Sunday, the second in a 2-0 win at Livingston.</p>
      <p>He has nine goals in 12 matches for Steven Gerrard's side, who are level with Scottish Premiership League leaders Celtic on 31 points.</p>
      <p>Premier League rivals Leicester City were rumoured to be interested in Morelos, as are Crystal Palace.</p>
