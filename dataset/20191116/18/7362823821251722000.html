      <h1>Veteran with service dog denied entry to Pittsburgh restaurant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:38:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A combat <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/veterans">veteran </a>who suffers from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/ptsd">PTSD </a>said he was denied access to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania">Pittsburgh </a>restaurant on Thursday because of his service dog.</p>
      <p>Kris Jones accused the owner of The Huddle restaurant of stopping him; his Dutch Shepherd, Chopper; and a friend from entering the establishment.</p>
      <p>"He's very important to me. He's definitely my lifeline," Jones said about his furry companion, according to <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/veteran-with-service-dog-refused-entry-to-pittsburgh-restaurant/29816814">WTAE</a>.</p>

      <p>"He makes me feel safe. A lot of veterans, you don't want to be alone, when you're going into a public place or a restaurant, it can be pretty stressful.”</p>
      <p>Jones enlisted in the Marines after the Sept. 11 attacks. He was injured during combat and later diagnosed with PTSD.</p>
      <p>Chopper, he said, changed his life for the better.</p>

      <p>Jones admitted Chopper wasn’t wearing his service dog vest but did have on his collar. However, he said was never given a chance to show documentation that Chopper was a service dog.</p>
      <p>The owner of The Huddle, Pete Wagner, later said that he made a mistake.</p>
      <p>Wagner said his business often accommodates service dogs, but he failed to realize Chopper was a service dog because the restaurant was crowded on the night Jones came in, due to a Steelers game.</p>
      <p>Jones said he wants the incident to be a lesson to others about the reality for many veterans and people suffering from PTSD.</p>

      <p>"I want business owners, people, everywhere, children, everywhere to know that PTSD is a big thing,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A lot of veterans come home and people can look OK and look fine, but you don’t know what’s going on on the inside.”</p>
