      <p>Exeter City boss Matt Taylor expressed his disappointment after the Grecians were held to a goalless draw at home to Cheltenham Town.</p>
      <p>The clubs cancelled each other out in an uninspiring clash at St James Park that saw the Grecians have the better chances.</p>
      <p>Taylor said that it wasn’t for the lack of trying, but it was two good teams who ended up cancelling each other out.</p>
      <p>“I am pleased with our intent, our attitude and the way in which we approached the game,” Taylor said.</p>

      <p>“It was two good teams, two well organised teams and it was going to come down to one moment of real quality that neither team were able to create on the day, a mistake, or a bit of luck.”</p>

      <p>Arguably City’s best chance came late in the first half when Randall Williams, City’s best player on the day, had the option to shoot or slip in Alex Fisher but mis-hit his pass, and Taylor said other than that, ‘when their lad slipped’, the rest of it was a matchup of one v ones all over the pitch with two good teams with an honest set of players going at it.</p>
      <p>He added: “We are disappointed that we didn’t win the game, or threaten their goal more, but it wasn’t for the lack of trying.</p>
      <p>“That is as weak as we will be this season – there are a lot of good attacking players to come back in.</p>

      <p>“I can’t fault my team and that’s two on the bounce. I said about the two poor goals we conceded at Bradford and we know it was a poor goal conceded at the end of the Cambridge game, an individual mistake, but I thought our boys defended the box really well.</p>
      <p>“It was difficult because it was going to take something special today and we didn’t quite have it.” </p>
      <p>The result sees the Grecians remain in 5 place in the table, a point and a place above the Robins.</p>
