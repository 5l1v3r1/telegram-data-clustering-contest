      <h2>Just a coincidence.</h2>

        <b>Prince Andrew blinked 10 times in 10 seconds during his response to a question about whether he had sex with an underage girl who had been trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During a BBC interview, the Duke of York was asked about Virginia Giuffre, who was pictured with and claimed she had sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17-years-old.</p>
      <p>I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” said the Duke.</p>
      <p>“You don’t remember meeting her?” he was then asked.</p>
      <p>“No,” responded Prince Andrew.</p>

      <p>During his answer, the Duke blinked no less than 10 times in the space of just 10 seconds.</p>
      <p>According to numerous <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2589073/Liars-are-exposed-by-blinking.html">scientific studies</a>, including one published by the Journal of Non-verbal Behaviour, rapid blinking is a reliable indicator that a person is lying.</p>
      <p>Indeed, that study found that when the subject is being asked a question, “the blink rate in the liars went down.” While Prince Andrew was listening to the question, he didn’t blink once.</p>
      <p>The study found that after the question was asked, “the blink rate of the liars increased rapidly,” which is exactly what happened during Prince Andrew’s interview.</p>
      <p>Again, this is just a coincidence and suggests absolutely nothing untoward.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Duke of York said he believes palling around with and staying at the house of a convicted sex offender two years after Epstein was charged with having sex with minors was at the time “the honorable and right thing to do.”</p>
      <p>Again, nothing out of the ordinary there.</p>
