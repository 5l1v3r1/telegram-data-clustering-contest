      <p>Back in 2001, which is almost two decades ago now, a plucky crew put together a movie called The Fast and the Furious. It had a tiny budget of just $38 million and used a formula that was untested, but this blossomed into one of the most profitable, sprawling franchises.</p>
      <p>Japanese cars, muscle cars, Jettas - F&amp;F had everything, though most people probably best remember the orange Supra driven by Paul Walker's character. This is thanks to two iconic scenes, the one where Brian "smokes" a Ferrari and where he goes against Dom, playing chicken on the train tracks.</p>
      <p>It's amazing to think that without those two short scenes, the Supra might not be what it is today. Such a car deserves some kind of tribute, and graphics artist <b>Roman Miah</b> just produced such a thing.</p>
      <p>It's a face swap of sorts, featuring a much simpler front end for the 2020 Supra. Yes, it's still got LED headlights and a crisp sports look but paired with a large air intake in place of the pointy nose. It's actually something the artist <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-toyota-supra-rendering-looks-more-like-the-original-132005.html">put together at the beginning of the year. </a>But since his <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-nissan-gt-r-nismo-gets-r34-face-swap-looks-like-a-perfect-match-138643.html">2020 GT-R Nismo R34 face swap</a> got so much traction, he decided to have another Paul Walker tribute piece.</p>
      <p>Of course, that wouldn't work without the original graphics, the vented hood, 90s wheels, and a big bolt-on wing. There's even a version of the rendering with the Targa top, which would be good for reading actors' expressions. All we need now is a 2JZ engine swap and some kind of face-swapped Dodge to drag race.</p>
