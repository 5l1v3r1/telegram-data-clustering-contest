        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/kodak-black-sentenced-to-almost-four-years-in-prison-for-lying-on-gun-application-HVwX-JgJcEm9Zl52EgSZOQ/">Earlier this week, the “Tunnel Vision” rapper was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison for lying on a federal application to buy three guns.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Prosecutors consider Kodak Black, real name Bill K. Kapri a “habitual violent offender,” who is now facing up to 30 more years in prison over two new gun charges filed by the state.</p>
      <p>These new charges arrive over allegations that two of those guns he bought were discovered at two different crime scenes.</p>
      <p>The firearms were allegedly used in two different attacks on his enemies, but he was not charged in incidents at the time the evidence was discovered.</p>
      <p>When Kodak Black was sentenced for lying on his gun application, he apologized for his mistakes, but the judge was unmoved.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237408344.html">According to the Miami Herald, Judge Federico Moreno refused to cut the rapper any slack and sentenced him to almost four years in prison.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“Young people do stupid things and I normally give them a break for that,” Judge Moreno said as he sentenced Kodak Black. “The problem is that you have been doing stupid things since 15.”</p>
      <p>
