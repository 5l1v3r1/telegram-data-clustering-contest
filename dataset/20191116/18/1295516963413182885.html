      <h1>Crisis' LaMonica Garrett Reveals Which Other DC Character He'd Like to Play</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:11:37+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Evangelia Galanis</a></address>
      <p>The Anti-Monitor will make his menacing mark on the Arrowverse in the upcoming "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" crossover special. Recently, his portrayer, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-infinite-earths-lamonica-garrett-anti-monitor-interview/">LaMonica Garrett, spoke to CBR</a> and revealed that if he could, he'd play another super-character.</p>
      <p>CBR discussed how the Arrowverse's multiverse allowed for actors to tackle multiple different roles. When asked what other character Garrett would love to play, he answered, "Ah that's a tricky question. I think, if I had a list of five things to play in the Arrowverse, what I'm doing now would be in the top three. Monitor and Anti-Monitor, knowing <a href="https://screenrant.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-teasers-new-arrowverse-heroes/">how big the 'Crisis' is</a> --to me, it doesn't get any bigger. I don't know! Maybe like a Val-Zod Superman would be up there."</p>

      <p>He elaborated, saying, "That's tricky, because certain actors are hinted or are playing certain characters already, and you don't want to step on those toes. I'm trying to think of characters that haven't made an appearance yet, and I think Val-Zod would be awesome to play in the Arrowverse."</p>
      <p>Val-Zod is the Superman of Earth 2. He is one of the last surviving Kryptonians on his Earth and eventually, he became the second person to take on the mantle of Superman. Val-Zod was friends with a young Kara Zor-El on Krypton and together, the two of them, Kal-El, and another child were able to escape the doomed planet.</p>
