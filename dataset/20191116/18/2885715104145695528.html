      <h1>Gujarat High Court issues notice to registrar, state government on EWS quota</h1>
      <h2>The notice is returnable on January 10 next year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:32:12+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>The Gujarat High Court on Friday issued notices to the court registrar and the state government on a petition seeking implementation of the economically weaker sections (EWS) quota in recruitment of civil judges. The notice is returnable on January 10 next year.</p>
      <p>Surendranagar-based law-yer Dilipkumar Savukiya, in his petition, challenged two advertisements issued by the Registrar (Recruitment Cell) of the High Court. The Gujarat government and Gujarat Public Service Commission are also respondents to the petition.</p>
      <p>Savukiya was enrolled with the State Bar Council of Gujarat in July 2010 and wanted to apply for the post of civil judge but found that the advertisement did not mention the 10% reservation of the EWS quota. As Savukiya is 36 years old, he had crossed the age limit specified for the general category, which is 35 years, but would qualify under the EWS quota where the age limit is relaxed by 3 years.</p>
      <p>The EWS quota was included as an amendment in the Constitution and came into force from January 12 this year.</p>
      <p>Last month, a public interest litigation seeking the implementation of the EWS quota effect was withdrawn after a division bench of the high court ruled that as the subject of the PIL pertained to service matters, it was not maintainable as a PIL but could be filed as a writ petition. The court noted that only candidates who applied for the post and qualified under the EWS quota could move the writ petition.</p>
      <p>The petitioner has sought the courtâ€™s direction to implement the EWS quota in the recruitment of civil judges, and to quash advertisements for the posts that did not factor in the EWS quota. Pending disposal of the case, the petitioner has sought that that court stay the implementation, execution and operation of the recruitment process.</p>
