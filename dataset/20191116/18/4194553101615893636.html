      <h1>Rafa Benitez on his hilarious troubles with the Scouse accent – including a brilliant Jamie Carragher tale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:30:39+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Former Reds boss Rafa Benitez, who now coaches Dalian Yifang in the Chinese Super League, has recalled some of his difficulties when speaking to both his daughter and Jamie Carragher – because they both have thick Scouse accents.</p>
      <p>Benitez’s wife and daughters still live in Merseyside, with the youngest having grown up around the city because of his job at Anfield. The family moved to the area soon after she was born.</p>
      <p>Carragher’s accent, meanwhile, needs no introduction.</p>
      <p>Benitez told the excellent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07tz9ns">BBC Radio 5Live Football Daily Podcast</a>: <b>“My daughter is a Scouser. She told me in my kitchen, ‘give me my butty’. I didn’t know what she wanted – she wanted a sandwich.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“I remember one press conference, Carra was talking with me before a Champions League game. The translator, when he started talking, said, ‘what is he talking about?’. She couldn’t understand what Carra was saying – it was difficult for the translator as well!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The full podcast, with many more questions posed to the Spaniard, is well worth a listen. In it, Benitez makes no secret of the fact that he wants to manage in England again one day, preferably somewhere close to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>There will surely be no shortage of options for him when that time comes, though he also made clear that he was very much enjoying his adventure in China.</p>
