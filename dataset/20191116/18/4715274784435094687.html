      <p>“You see, I’m a very serious person and mom helped me to be a lighter person and to have fun and enjoy and enjoy myself,” the statuesque 23-year-old said during the send-off press conference held in Quezon City on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“My game plan is to just do my best in all the fast-track events of Miss World. I hope for the world to see the beauty in Filipinos and what we have to offer as a country,“ the psychology graduate said. “For the Miss World Beauty with a Purpose, I think my personal advocacy happens to fit the Miss World criteria, that is raising awareness on addressing autism.”</p>
      <p>Michelle has been collaborating with the Autism Society Philippines, specifically, to bring attention to the needs of children on the spectrum. She wants to help on how to increase the chapters of Autism Society Philippines, especially, in the rural areas, knowing the high number of undiagnosed cases of autism due to lack of facilities and awareness.</p>

      <p>For Miss World Philippines national director, being the daughter of a former Miss International could work to Michelle’s favor. </p>
      <p>“Of course there’s a lot of pressure living up to her family’s legacy, but let’s just hope she does her best,” said Vegafria. “Her Filipina looks, plus her experience as an actress and model are definitely a big plus, and I think her heart is in the right place when it comes to her personal advocacy.”</p>
      <p> Michelle is going to the Miss World with a set of wardrobe from nothing but the best with the likes of Renee Salud, Nono Palmos, Chris Nick, and Jojo Bragais, to name a few. </p>
      <p>Contributing to ensure the Fil-Chinese beauty’s victory, Michelle’s finals evening gown and national costume are designed by Francis Libiran.</p>
      <p>Will Michelle duplicate Melanie’s feat and achieve the rare distinction as the first-ever mother-daughter to win major international titles?</p>
