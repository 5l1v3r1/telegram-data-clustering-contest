      <h1>Patriot Missile Systems Disguised as Russia's S-400 Used in Israeli Air Force Drills – Report</h1>

      <p>Pilots in modified Israeli F-35I "Adir" jets, participating in Blue Flag war games, have tested their skills to conduct operations in areas covered by modern air defence systems, such as Russia’s S-400s, which were delivered to Turkey this year.</p>
      <p>Due to the absence of actual S-400s, Israel and other participants in the war games from the US, Germany, Italy, and Greece used US-made Patriot missile batteries modified to emulate S-400s, the media outlet Breaking Defence reported. It's unclear though exactly how the Patriots were modified to match the S-400, which has two times the effective range than the American "analogue" and minimal set-up time.</p>

      <p>Breaking Defence called the exercise "good practice" for the F-35Is, which have <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201909201076848464-us-has-reason-to-be-concerned-over-f-35s-amid-turkeys-purchase-of-s-400-systems--russian-mod/">never actually encountered the S-400 in a real battle</a>. So far Turkey is the only one in the Middle East region <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908281076664840-pentagon-turkey-ditches-russian-s-400-return-to-f-35-programme/">to possess the cutting-edge air defence system</a>, though other states also expressed interest in buying it, namely Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>One of Israel's main rivals in the region, Iran, also <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201801231060982260-russia-discuss-s400-deliveries-east/">wished to buy Russian systems</a>, according to Bloomberg citing anonymous sources. The media said that Moscow had declined the offer in a bid to avoid an escalation of tensions in the region. However, conflicting reports from a Russian media outlet, also citing an anonymous source, said that Moscow never received any requests from Tehran to buy S-400s.</p>
