      <h1>Former Nottingham Forest striker shows he can still cut it with late winner</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Forest latest - Murphy departed the City Ground at the end of last season after being released following two years at the club.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:51:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:51</time> by <a rel="author">PA, Jamie Kemble</a></address>
      <p>Bolton have wiped out their points deduction after former <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> striker Daryl Murphy's stoppage-time winner saw off 10-man MK Dons 1-0.</p>
      <p>The victory made it a third straight win for Wanderers - who started the campaign on -12 points after going into administration - and moved them on to one point for the campaign, 12 points from safety.</p>
      <p>MK Dons appeared to have done enough to stop their three-match losing run when goalkeeper Lee Nicholls saved Murphy's 90th-minute penalty.</p>
      <p>But three minutes into added time, Murphy turned in Thibaud Verlinden's cross to take Wanderers from negative numbers into the black.</p>
