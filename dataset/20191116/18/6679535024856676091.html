      <p>A herd of elephants that ventured into human habitations caused damages to a transformer at Naickenpalayam here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Forest officials said that the elephants were not injured in the incident while there were minor damages to the transformer. The incident happened in the morning when a herd of five elephants ventured into Naickenpalayam area.</p>
      <p>The elephants were reportedly chased by people in the locality. While moving, the elephants reportedly pushed wires of electric poles that supported the transformer. The poles were shaken, emitting sparks and bursts from the transformer.</p>
      <p>Periyanaickenpalayam forest range officer S. Suresh said that the incident happened when the herd was on its way back to the forest.</p>
      <p>“The elephants had come in contact with the stay wire. We immediately alerted Tangedco officials who inspected the place. There were only minimal damages to the transformer,” he said.</p>
      <p>The officer said that the herd went back to the forest and a team was posted in the area to monitor the movement of the herd.</p>
