      <p>Barcelona forward Antoine Griezmann has given his backing to the strike currently taking place in the women's game in Spain. Griezmann, who is currently with the France team, retweeted and commented on a message from the AFE, the Association of Spanish Footballers.</p>
      <p>Griezmann expressed his support for Spain's female players, who have decided to strike this weekend after failing to negotiate a collective agreement that responded to their expectations. They are demanding a professional agreement that regulates minimum working conditions, rights to minimum wages and measures for maternity.</p>
      <p>They have found support from Griezmann, who posted the following message:</p>
      <p>"I send all of my support to my colleagues in the women's game that are currently on strike fighting for their rights," the Barça star wrote.</p>
