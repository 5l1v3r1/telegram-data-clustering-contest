      <h2>Parties undertaking project have promised to complete work by December: MP</h2>

      <p>The Pumpwell flyover on NH 66, which has been getting multiple deadlines for its completion for nearly a decade, will be opened to traffic by January first week, said Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters after a site visit here, Mr. Kateel said officials from the National Highways Authority of India and concessionaire M/s Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt., Ltd., have promised to complete the construction work by December-end. As such, the flyover should be inaugurated by January first week, he said.</p>
      <p>He said the four-laning work of NH 66 in Dakshina Kannada is almost 95% complete.</p>
      <p>There were delays with regard to Thokkottu and Pumpwell Flyovers near Mangaluru because of legal, administrative and financial issues. The Thokkottu flyover is open already and Pumpwell will be ready by January, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kateel noted that during the January visit of Union Road Transport and Highway Ministry Secretary, M/s Navayuga had expressed financial constraints to complete the project. Union MoRTH Minister Nitin Gadkari not only facilitated a bank loan but also arranged funds from the government for the project.</p>
      <p>In between, there was demand for an underpass connecting Indiana Hospital and Fr. Muller Convention Centre. It took time to accommodate this demand too, the MP said.</p>
      <p>Extended monsoon also contributed to the delay. The Deputy Commissioner has already held talks with NHAI and others three times and directed them to complete the work at the earliest, Mr. Kateel said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wider service Roads</b>
      </p>
      <p>In view of the voluminous traffic around Pumpwell, the roads on the flanks of the flyover cannot be considered as service roads.</p>
      <p>They would be considered as a part of the National Highway itself and would be widened for 20 metres to accommodate heavy flow of vehicles, Nalin Kumat Kateel MP said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, looking at the pathetic condition of the service roads, Mr. Kateel directed the NHAI to immediately repair the service roads to make them traffic-worthy.</p>
      <p>Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyasa Kamath suggested to the authority not to close down both the service roads; but take up work one after the others.</p>
