      <h1>Rangers fans baited with Celtic scarves and banners during Colts' win over Wrexham</h1>

      <p>They travelled down in their hundreds for a taste of the big time as Wrexham fans headed to Ibrox determined to create a big game atmosphere for their Tunnockâ€™s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup semi-final with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-colts">Rangers Colts</a> .</p>
      <p>Part of their plan appeared to be siding with their opponents bitter Glasgow rivals <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> after flags and even a banner featuring the Parkhead club's crest was held up in the away end of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> .</p>
      <p>Nearly 1000 punters from the Welsh town made the long journey to Glasgow as they attempted to create a carnival atmosphere in their little corner of the ground.</p>
      <p>The game ended in a 2-0 victory for Rangers' Colts after goals from Jamie Barjonas and 16-year-old Nathan Young-Coombes dampened the travelling support's enthusiasm.</p>

      <p>It sends the youngsters into the semi-final of the competition, the first time a Colts team has ever reached such a lofty stage of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Rangers have already dispatched the likes of Solihul Moors, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stranraer-fc">Stranraer</a> and Ballymena United on their journey to date.</p>
