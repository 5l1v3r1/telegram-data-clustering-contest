      <p>Taking to Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/My_CrimeWatch/status/1195255343686643712">@My_CrimeWatch</a> shared images of honest policemen arresting a foreigner for driving without a license.</p>
      <p>The arrest which took place at Jalan Daeng Selili, Kuala Kangsar involved two on patrol police officers arresting a Myanmar national but with a twist.</p>
      <p>Caught on camera, is the manâ€™s attempt to wiggle his way out of his arrest by offering bribes to both policemen.</p>

      <p>Now it is important to note, that taking AND giving bribes is a big no-no in this country.</p>
      <p>Not wanting to partake in the bribery, the police officers simply took the man into custody.</p>
      <p>Here are pictures of the arrest.</p>

      <p>Not only will the suspect now be arrested for traffic offences, but he can also now be charged under the Malaysian Anti-corruption Act 2009 for offering/giving bribe which could be met with prison time and a heavy fine.</p>
      <p>Smart.</p>
      <p>
        <i>We applaud honest policemen out there who continue to carry out their duties with integrity, and we hope that this is a recurring theme for not only the police force but also everyone in Malaysia.Â </i>
