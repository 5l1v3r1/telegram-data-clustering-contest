      <p>The Singanallur police have booked three persons on charges of catching fish from Singanallur tank where ban on commercial fishing came to effect on January 1 this year.</p>
      <p>V. Balakrishnan from Vellalore, M. Jagan from Sankar Nagar and M. Ramakrishnan from Vellalore were arrested based on a complaint filed by M. Selvan, assistant commissioner of Coimbatore Corporation's East Zone.</p>
      <p>Though fishing was continuing on the tank even after January 1, authorities had not taken action. In October, a board was placed at the tank bund stating that action would be taken against those who engage in fishing. However, fishing continued day and night.</p>
      <p>As per the case registered by the police on Friday, the three men caught fish violating the ban. Also, the fish caught from the tank were also not fit for consumption, it said.</p>
      <p>It was Minister for Municipal Administration and Rural Development S.P. Velumani who announced the ban on commercial fishing, stating that the move was to protect the ecosystem of the water body and protect the fresh water fish species.</p>
