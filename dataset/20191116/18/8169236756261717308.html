      <h1>Video: Non-league Nuneaton goalkeeper breaks light with terrible penalty</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:41:01+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>Nuneton Borough goalkeeper Tony Breeden may have produced the best moment of football this week after his awful penalty broke a stadium light earlier today.</p>
      <p>Just over sixty minutes into today’s clash between Southern Central Premier Division side Nuneaton Borough and Stratford Town, Boro were awarded a penalty.</p>
      <p>As per their <a href="https://www.pitchero.com/clubs/nuneatonboroughfc/news/boro-2-stratford-town-0-secondhalf-goals-lift-boro-back-into-playoffs-2487262.html">official website penalty taker Luke Benbow</a> was on the bench so goalkeeper Tony Breeden shocked everyone by running up and setting himself for the penalty.</p>
      <p>Breeden had a moment to forget as his effort sky-rocketed over the bar and ended up hitting one of the floodlights that was hung up on the terrace.</p>
      <p>Fortunately the penalty miss didn’t prove to be costly as Boro went on to win the clash 2-0.</p>

      <p>Boro actually had another penalty later in the game and manager Jimmy Ginnelly urged Breeden to stay back, as per the club’s hilarious <a href="https://twitter.com/NuneatonBoroFC/status/1195745394908704769">Twitter account</a>.</p>
      <p>Breeden also reflected on the moment in a light-hearted manner after the game, take a look at his tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/Breedstar13/status/1195758307501395968">here</a>.</p>
