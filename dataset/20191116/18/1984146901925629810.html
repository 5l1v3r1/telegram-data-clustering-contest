      <h1>Life in Ouseburn's The Malings where people rent their homes to the neighbours</h1>
      <h2>The Malings has won awards for it’s unique design and community focus. Now, residents share their thoughts on what it is like to live there</h2>

      <p>It was once voted one of the trendiest places to live in the UK thanks to its luxury homes and eye-catching developments.</p>
      <p>But what is life like living at the quirky The Malings development on the bank of the River <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ouseburn">Ouseburn</a>?</p>
      <p>All 76 homes have been designed with the individual in mind, boasting high ceilings, cheerful brightly coloured doors and convenient commercial spaces for local businesses to thrive.</p>
      <p>One resident said: "I don’t exaggerate when I say it’s everything we wished for."</p>

      <p>Nestled in the heart of the community lives Jill Lamb, who is on her way to take two-year-old daughter, Stella, to ballet class.</p>
      <p>Jill moved to the area from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> to be among the lively Ouseburn lifestyle.</p>
      <p>However, since moving to the area, Jill has become a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/parenting">parent</a> and now finds a number of features impractical for life with a toddler.</p>
      <p>The lack of garden space, and living area on the top floor of the house while her kitchen sits on the ground floor has proven particularly difficult for the family.</p>
      <p>Despite this, she enjoys living at The Malings and highlights that there is a good sense of community among residents who remain in regular contact through resident Whatsapp and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> groups.</p>
      <p>Resident and Malings Residents Association Chairman, Stuart Wannop, moved to the area from the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/quayside-newcastle">Quayside</a> three years ago.</p>
      <p>While he agrees that the The Malings isn’t the best place to live if you desire a quiet life, he echoes that there is a strong sense of community embedded in The Malings.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old explains: “If somebody needs to borrow something, a quick post on the Facebook group and someone will usually come up trumps.</p>
      <p>“Some have even been known to loan their house to a neighbour for a weekend when relatives come to stay.”</p>

      <p>Stepping into the neighbouring Brinkburn Street Bar and Kitchen bar, which hosts Malings residents association meetings, we meet Jackie Christer who is visiting her son, Will.</p>
      <p>Will Christer lives on Ouseburn Wharf, and is currently entertaining his brother on a staycation in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>They have visited the new Ghetto Golf on Hoults Yard and local businesses, Proven Goods Co and Kiln.</p>
      <p>Jackie explains that despite living in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/prudhoe">Prudhoe</a>, she has only recently discovered Ouseburn and has fallen in love with the area.</p>
      <p>The 61-year-old said: “I love it in Ouseburn. I love the mix of people – young and old – and the atmosphere is really inclusive.”</p>
      <p>The Malings was designed by architect, Ash Sakula, to nurture a genuine sense of cohesion and engagement among the inhabitants.</p>
      <p>And speaking to people in Ouseburn, it appears Ash Sakula’s vision has been accomplished.</p>
      <p>Following The Malings development, a second phase situated on Lower Steenberg's Yard in Ouseburn has been granted.</p>
      <p>This will feature 28 new riverside apartments and four new commercial spaces.</p>
