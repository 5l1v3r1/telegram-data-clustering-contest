      <p>Accra, Nov. 16, GNA - The 2020 Post Budget Workshop for Members of Parliament opened in Accra on Saturday for a meaningful debate and analysis of the policy underpinnings of the Budget.</p>
      <p>For the first time in many years the post-budget workshop is being at the premises of Parliament; the D.F. Annan Auditorium, to save the nation the cost of having to travel outside Accra with a huge budget, especially as the Government embarks on fiscal discipline.</p>
      <p>It is on the theme: “Consolidating the Gains for Growth, Jobs and Prosperity for All,” same as the 2020 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of the Government.</p>
      <p>Prof. Aaron Michael Oquaye, the Speaker of Parliament, said: “I am happy that we’re not traveling outside Accra, and come back with a budget of …. GHC 1.7 million.”</p>
      <p>He said such were the things that prevented Members of Parliament and other staff to enjoy better privileges, including housing and vehicles.</p>
      <p>The post budget workshop is a budgetary affair, which involved opportunity cost on how best to maximise the use of resources in terms of the benefits.</p>
      <p>Prof Oquaye called on members to engage in meaningful deliberations and make all necessary documents available to the House to enrich discussions.</p>
      <p>“It is important to develop this politics of issues,” the Speaker said, and urged the legislators not to give room to politics of vituperations.</p>
      <p>The workshop would tackle topics such as; “Policy Underpinnings of the 2020 Budget”, “Overview of the 2020 Budget - Macro Economic and Fiscal Management”, and “What to Consider in Analysing the 2020 Sector Budgets.”</p>
      <p>Also to be considered are: “Planning and Delivery on Infrastructure,” “Revenue Mobilisation,” “Workers’ Perspective of the 2020 Budget,” and “The 2020 Budget and the Energy Sector.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, the Minister of Finance, said Ghana’s economy still faced some structural ‘headwinds’ despite its positive outlook for 2020.</p>
      <p>“We still have some structural headwinds in terms of the wages, interest and revenue to deal with as the economy grows,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori-Atta said the two main challenges the nation continued to face was the energy sector IPP payments, and the financial sector clean-up, which were being done to ensure value for money.</p>
      <p>The Government had targeted 6.8 per cent of GDP, non-oil growth of 4.6 per cent, inflation of eight per cent and overall deficit of four per cent.</p>
      <p>He gave the assurance that the Government was committed to ensuring that there was no budgetary overruns or overspending in the 2020 Election year.</p>
      <p>Majority Leader and Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Mr Osei Kyei Mensah Bonsu, said the MPs had a duty to thoroughly scrutinise the Budget devoid of political differences and find common grounds on technical matters germane to its content.</p>
      <p>He, however, wondered why there were only 55 of the 275 members present when the programme had long started.</p>
      <p>Mr Mensah Bonsu urged the MPs to critically examine issues for well-informed contributions, rather than propaganda, when the debate on the 2020 Budget starts on Monday.</p>
      <p>He said the debate would be about the principles of the budget, and urged members to discuss that rather than the estimates.</p>
      <p>Mr Haruna Iddrisu, the Minority Leader, said the Finance Minister must to brief the House on how much money government had pumped into cleaning the financial sector.</p>
      <p>He suggested that subsequent budgets should indicate Ghana’s commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
      <p>He called on the Government to stick to its pledge of avoiding budget overruns next year.</p>
