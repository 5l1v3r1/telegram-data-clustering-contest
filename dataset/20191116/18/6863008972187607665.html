      <p>Ukraine Navy artillery boats Berdyansk and Nikopol, seized by Russia near the Kerch Strait in November 2018, as well as the Yany Kapu tugboat, will be returned to Ukraine overnight Sunday.</p>
      <p>The report says special vessels are now heading from the Pivdenny port to pick up the boats off the coast of Cape Tarkhankut, an Odesa-based <a href="https://dumskaya.net/news/ukrainskie-katera-i-bukstr-zahvachennye-rossiyan-105482/">Dumskaya </a>news outlet reports.</p>
      <p>The Russian side is tugging Ukrainian boats from the port of Kerch in the occupied Crimea.</p>
      <p>According to Dumskaya, the transfer of ships will take place at high seas some 60 nautical miles from Odesa, near Cape Tarkhankut.</p>
