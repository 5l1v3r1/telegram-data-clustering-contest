      <p><i>Sports Illustrated’s</i> <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/jasmine-sanders/">Jasmine Sanders</a> shared a new, sultry bikini snap with her Instagram fans today. She was seen crouching near the ground, as she balanced herself on her feet. The bikini that she wore was tiny, with the top featuring small strips of fabric. The bottoms were also small, although they were mostly obscured thanks to her pose.</p>
      <p>Jasmine wore her hair slicked back into an extra-long, braided ponytail. In the first photo, the stunner brushed her ponytail in front of her right shoulder, and it reached past her belly button. She looked down, while she appeared to be in the middle of adjusting herself as her hands were in the air. Her toned midriff was on full display for the shot, as she accessorized with hoop earrings and a silver watch on her left wrist.</p>
      <p>The second photo offered a more flirty vibe, as she was seen sitting upright. Jasmine threw her head back with a big smile on her face, as she closed her eyes. She placed her hands in the front of her midriff, and bent her right arm. Meanwhile, her bare derriere could be seen, as she propped herself up with her right knee. Her infinity tattoo also peeked through on her right side.</p>
      <p>Behind the model, you could see a white, wooden wall. The photo was geotagged in Los Angeles, California, and she appeared to be posing outdoors.</p>

      <p>Fans had plenty of nice compliments for Jasmine in the comments section.</p>
      <p>“You look so much like Rita Ora,” noted a follower, with others also echoing the same thought.</p>
      <p>“I like what I see and what I see is beautifulness,” gushed an admirer.</p>

      <p>“Ugh this natural body is just amazing,” declared a fan.</p>
      <p>“I love how confident you are in your own body and it’s so nice to see a natural set of breast that arnt fake. You make natural beauty look the way it’s supposed to. Thanks for keeping it real and promoting a healthy body image,” applauded a fourth Instagram user.</p>
      <p>In addition, the bombshell shared another bikini pic earlier this month. This time, she likened her <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5727253/sports-illustrated-swimsuit-jasmine-sanders-bikini-floss/">thong swimsuit</a> to floss, as she posed in a tiny, white ensemble. The outfit looked like a bikini from the front, although the back appeared to reveal that it was a one-piece. There were thin straps that criss-crossed in the back. The model held a piece of white floss to pose for the photo, and rocked her hair in tight curls. Behind her was a pool, as she stood on the deck.</p>
