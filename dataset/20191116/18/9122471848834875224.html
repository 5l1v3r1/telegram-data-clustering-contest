      <h1>Injury Update For Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa vs. Mississippi State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:37:07+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier Saturday morning, college football analyst Tim Tebow suggested Alabama should not play Tua Tagovailoa this weekend – for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>Tua, who played last weekend in a limited capacity against LSU, is recovering from an ankle injury. While he played last weekend, it was clear he wasn’t at 100-percent – he even said after the game that he played on one foot.</p>
      <p>However, Tua got the start on Saturday afternoon and got off to a hot start. Tagovailoa completed 14-of-18 passing for 256 yards an two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Tebow’s words of caution came back into play near the end of the first half. Tagovailoa took a nasty shot and had to be carted off of the field.</p>
      <p>It looked like he suffered some type of injury as his helmet popped off.</p>
      <p>Here’s the play.</p>

      <p>Fans are already calling out Nick Saban for leaving the star quarterback in the game with a 28-point lead.</p>
      <p>However, at this point in the season, the Crimson Tide need to win as many games by as many points as possible to stay in the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>Alabama’s chances to make the playoff obviously take a hit if Tua isn’t on the field, though.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>

      <p>UPDATE: ESPN is calling it a hip injury.</p>
