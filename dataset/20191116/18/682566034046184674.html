      <p>London -Â <b>Stefanos Tsitsipas</b> shocked six-time champion <b>Roger Federer </b>6-3, 6-4 to reach the final of the <b>ATP Finals</b> in his tournament debut on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Greek sixth seed, 17 years younger than his 38-year-old opponent, beat the Swiss at the Australian Open but had fallen to him twice since then.</p>
      <p>Federer was unrecognisable from the player who dominated Novak Djokovic in his final round-robin match, struggling on serve and hitting a total of 26 unforced errors compared with just five against the Serbian.</p>
      <p>But Tsitsipas belied his years with a performance full of confidence and grit, saving 11 out of 12 break points during the match.</p>
      <p>"I'm so proud of myself today, a great performance and once again the people were great," he said.</p>
      <p>"I really enjoyed myself on the court and sometimes in matches like these you wonder how you recover from difficulties and break point down.</p>
      <p>"It is a mental struggle and I'm proud how many I saved today, I was trying not to give an easy time to Roger. He was playing well."</p>
      <p>Coming into the match, the Greek 21-year-old led the tournament in service games won, with 35 out of 37.</p>
      <p>Thereafter it was a case of what might have been for Federer, who dropped just six points on his serve in the first set and saw a whopping six break points come and go.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas was forced to dig deep in a dramatic 13-minute final game in which he saved two break points and needed seven set points to close it out 6-3.</p>
      <p>Federer was in deep trouble when Tsitsipas broke him to love in the third game of the second set but he finally made a break point count -- his 10th, to level at 2-2.</p>
      <p>Undaunted, Tsitsipas, dominating rallies from the back of the court, broke again straight away with a forehand cross-court winner for a 3-2 lead.</p>
      <p>At 5-4 down Federer knew he had to break Tsitsipas for only the second time in the match.</p>
      <p>The Greek slipped to 15-40 down but Federer again could not take advantage, spraying a forehand out to give his opponent a match point and he won with a thundering ace.</p>
      <p>Federer, who was shaken by his two fluffed smashes, rued his missed chances.</p>
      <p>"I'm frustrated I couldn't play better, and when I did and fought my way back, I threw it away again," said the Swiss.</p>
      <p>"It was also parts of him. He did come up with the goods when he had to and he was better than me today.</p>
      <p>"It's the year-end. It's over now and I can't make it better. I tried everything I could, to be honest."</p>
      <p>A year ago, Tsitsipas won the Next Gen ATP Finals. Now, on his tournament debut he is one match away from winning the season-ending event, featuring the year's best eight players.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas first broke into the top 100 of the ATP rankings only 25 months ago.</p>
      <p>He will play either defending champion Alexander Zverev or fifth seed Dominic Thiem in Sunday's final.</p>
