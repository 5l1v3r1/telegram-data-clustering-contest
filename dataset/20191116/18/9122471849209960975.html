      <h1>Why QB Tua Tagovailoa Was Still Playing In Blowout vs. Mississippi State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:49:05+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was carted off the field with an injury late in the first half of the Crimson Tide’s afternoon contest against Mississippi State. The injury came with Nick Saban’s team leading, 35-7.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, who played last week vs. LSU on a non-100 percent ankle, appeared to injure his hip on a play late in the first half.</p>
      <p>Alabama’s quarterback was reportedly “screaming in pain” and <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/injury-update-for-alabama-qb-tua-tagovailoa-vs-mississippi-state">had to be carted off the field</a>.</p>
      <p>Saban has since been criticized for leaving the less-than 100 percent quarterback in for too long, especially with the game in hand.</p>
      <p>“Why in the hail is Tua in the game when you are up 35-7? That makes no sense. None!” ESPN’s David Pollack tweeted. He certainly wasn’t alone with this line of thinking, either.</p>

      <p>Saban then revealed to ESPN that it was going to be Tagovailoa’s final drive of the game. They were OK with giving him some two-minute drill practice.</p>
      <p>“That was going to be his last series. We were going to put Mac in and we said ‘Let’s put Tua in before the half for 2-minute (drill) just for practice,” he told ESPN.</p>

      <p>Despite earlier reports, Tua reportedly did not lobby to stay in the game.</p>
      <p>Saban confirmed that the quarterback injured his hip.</p>
      <p>“He hurt his hip. I don’t know anything else more than that. That was going to be his last series of half. Certainly I don’t want to see anybody get hurt, especially not him,” Saban said.</p>

      <p>Alabama has an easy win next week, before taking on Auburn. Hopefully, Tagovailoa will be able to return in time for that contest. At this point, though, it’s tough to tell how severe this injury will be.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more updates on Tagovailoa’s injury.</p>
