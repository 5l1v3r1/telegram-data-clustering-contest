      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa re-injured vs. Mississippi State after lobbying to reenter game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T18:36:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 18:36</time> by <a rel="author">Zac Al-Khateeb</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa re-injured himself in the Crimson Tide's game against Mississippi State on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, with Alabama up 35-7 and enough time remaining for one final drive in the half, was seen <a href="https://twitter.com/colecubelic/status/1195781372234870784">lobbying Nick Saban to reenter the game</a>. He was injured on third play of the ensuing drive; he left the game on an injury cart, unable to put any weight on his right leg. He also seemed to have suffered a facial injury.</p>

      <p>According to the ESPN telecast, Tagovailoa suffered an injury to his right hip â€” not his knee or ankle. He was also heard screaming in pain and is heading to receive an X-ray.</p>
      <p>Saban later said it was his decision to place Tagovailoa back in the game, in order to run a two-minute drill.</p>

      <p>According to the ESPN telecast, Tagovailoa left Davis Wade Stadium in an ambulance. He was then helicoptered to St. Vincent's Medical Center in Birmingham, Ala., according to a report from the Tuscaloosa News' <a href="https://twitter.com/CecilHurt/status/1195795898535686144">Cecil Hurts.</a></p>

      <p>A long-lasting injury to Tagovailoa would be a worst-case scenario for Alabama, which likely needs him to beat Auburn in the Iron Bowl later this season and, presumably, make a final attempt at the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa finished the game 14 of 18 passing for 256 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
