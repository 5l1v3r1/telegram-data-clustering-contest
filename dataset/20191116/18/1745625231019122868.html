      <h3>CBS Winter Schedule Announcement Confirms No Surprise ‘Big Brother’ Season, Teases New Shows</h3>

      <p>It’s sad news for <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/big-brother"><i>Big Brother</i></a> and <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/celebrity-big-brother"><i>Celebrity Big Brother</i></a> fans. <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/CBS">CBS</a> has recently announced its winter 2020 schedule and it does not include a third season of <i>CBB</i> or a regular <i>BB</i> season. Many fans of the hit reality series were suspecting some sort of <i>BB</i> season was coming after longtime show host <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/julie-chen">Julie Chen</a> had <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5734546/julie-chen-silent-twitter-big-brother/">some bizarre Twitter activity</a> which all revolved around the show earlier this month. The new press release from <a href="https://www.cbs.com/recommended/news/1009545/cbs-winter-2020-schedule-premiere-dates-for-survivor-criminal-minds-new-series-and-more/">CBS</a> confirms six shows are returning to the network, while also revealing two new series for their primetime lineup. The network revealed a February premiere date for <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/survivor"><i>Survivor</i></a>, which will kick off its record-breaking 40th season.</p>
      <p>Season 40 of <i>Survivor</i> will see Jeff Probst back as host, and the show will premiere in the 8 p.m. time slot on February 12, 2020, for a special two-hour episode. The following episodes will all be one-hour long. According to <i><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a27532319/survivor-season-40-all-winners-cast-rumors/">Men’s Health</a></i>, the title of Season 40 will be <i>Winners at War</i>, meaning an all-star season is in the works. A cast for the new series has not been confirmed by CBS at this time.</p>
      <p>Two new CBS shows keeping <i>CBB</i> off the schedule are <i>FBI: Most Wanted</i> and <i>Tommy</i>. <i>FBI: Most Wanted</i> will immediately follow <i>FBI</i> in the 10 p.m. time slot on Tuesdays. The Dick Wolf series will follow in the footsteps of his popular <i>Law &amp; Order</i> and <i>Chicago</i> franchises, where several shows integrate with one another.</p>

      <p><i>FBI: Most Wanted</i> stars Julian McMahon (<i>Nip/Tuck</i>) and Kellan Lutz (<i>Twilight</i>). The agents work for the Fugitive Task Force and track down criminals on the FBI’s most-wanted list. <i>Tommy</i> falls in the same category as police and procedural drama and stars Emmy winner Edie Falco. Falco’s character is a former high-ranking NYPD officer who becomes the Cheif of Police for the LAPD. <i>Tommy</i> will air every Thursday at 10 p.m.</p>
      <p>Returning to CBS this winter is <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/criminal-minds"><i>Criminal Minds</i></a> (Season 15), <i>MacGyver</i> (Season 4), and <i>Undercover Boss</i> (Season 9). CBS also reported that <i>NCIS: New Orleans</i> is moving to Sunday alongside <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>.</p>
      <p>The scheduled announcement from CBS does not mean <i>CBB</i> is canceled for good, but the show might just be taking a season off. <i>Big Brother</i> has been confirmed for Season 22 next summer with Chen returning to host. Whether it will be an all-star season as suspected remains to be seen, and fans are sticking close to Chen’s Twitter to see if anything is teased for the new season.</p>
