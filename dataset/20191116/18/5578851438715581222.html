        <b>A heated discussion over a recent report in the UK’s Guardian about widespread sex abuse of school-aged children in Logar province roiled the House of Representatives on Saturday, with some members outraged by the abuse and others outraged by the claims.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Guardian article, published on Wednesday, alleged sexual abuse of “550 children and youth” from “six schools” in the province.</p>
      <p>Rahman Rahmani, the House speaker, described the alleged child abuse in Logar schools as "appalling" and called for the punishment of the perpetrators. “The news of children sexual abuse in Logar province was really terrifying,” said Rahmani.</p>
      <p>“Logar's case and the like ... it's not normal. Anyone who commits an act of sodomy twice is entitled to death,” said Nazir Ahmad Hanafi, a member of the Afghan House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>Two days ago, Mohammad Mussa Mahmoudi, the head of Logar's civil society, in an interview with TOLOnews claimed that a study he conducted in six schools in the province revealed that 550 students had been sexually abused.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, some members of the House of Representatives said that the allegations of mass sexual abuse of children in Logar province are false.</p>
      <p>“Some countries, some advertising networks, are trying to destroy this great and heroic nation,” said Sayed Ahmad Khadem, an Afghan Parliament member.</p>
      <p>“Several members of the Education and Internal Security Commission, and a few members from the same province, need to investigate the incident,” said Lailuma Hakimi, another member of parliament.</p>
      <p>A group of Logar residents on Saturday held a protest against the claims made by the Guardian and called for these “allegations” to be cleared.</p>

      <p>“This report is completely baseless and a lie and everyone who said it… is only for their own personal interest,” said Sayed Daoud Hashimi, one of the protesters.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) called on the Ministry of Interior (MoI) to ensure the safety of those who had revealed the allegations.</p>
      <p>“The AIHRC also calls on security agencies to ensure the safety of human rights activists and civil society activists working in this regard,” said Razia Sayad, Commissioner for Children, Human Rights Commission.</p>
      <p>“The police have taken serious security measures today to secure their office. They must report to relevant security authorities to ensure that threats are properly addressed,” said Nasrat Rahimi, the MoI spokesman.</p>
      <p>The acting education minister, Mirwais Balkhi, says the issue will be seriously investigated in the province’s schools.</p>
