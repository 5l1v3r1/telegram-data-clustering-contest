      <p>The Dravida Munnetra Kazahgam is trying to postpone local body elections as it is scared of facing the voters, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam spokesperson Kovai K. Selvaraj told journalists here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Stung by the defeat in the by-elections to the Vikravandi and Nanguneri Assembly constituencies, the DMK was trying to postpone the local body elections. Its president M.K. Stalin was yet to recover from the defeat and was, therefore, adopting one technique or the other to avoid facing the electorate,” he said.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, his party was functioning with a clear vision under the leadership of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Pannerselvam, Mr. Selvaraj said. When asked if there was a leadership vacuum in the State, he said, “If at all there is a vacuum it is only in the cinema industry where none has been able to fill the void left by M.G. Ramachandran and Shivaji Ganesan.”</p>
      <p>The AIADMK leadership continued to enjoy the support and confidence of party cadre and the AIADMK government had the people’s support. The party had no relationship whatsoever with V.K. Sasikala, a confidante of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, he added.</p>
