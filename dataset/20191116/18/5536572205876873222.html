      <p>Do you want to lose thousands of dollars for nothing, because this is how you lose thousands of dollars for nothing.</p>
      <p>The Ohio State Buckeyes are such heavy favorites for their game on Saturday that it borderlines on being quite ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Per Bovada, Ohio State is favored to beat Rutgers by 53 points.</p>
      <p>That didn’t seem to matter t one bettor because Ben Fawkes of ESPN reported a person laid down $13,750 on Rutgers to beat the 53-point spread.</p>
