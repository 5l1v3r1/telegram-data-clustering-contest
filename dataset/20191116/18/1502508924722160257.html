      <p>The Congress on Saturday fielded its national spokesperson Gourav Vallabh to take on Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das in the upcoming assembly elections.</p>
      <p>Congress president Sonia Gandhi approved Vallabh's candidature from the Jamshedpur East assembly constituency, while fielding Mamta Devi from the Ramgarh seat, a party statement said.</p>
      <p>With this, the total number of candidates declared so far by the Congress for the Jharkhand elections is 27.</p>
      <p>"I am ready for the challenge to take on the chief minister. The people of Jharkhand have been duped and I will emerge victorious in this electoral contest," said Vallabh, who recently went viral on internet after a showdown with BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra at a TV debate.</p>
      <p>Jharkhand will vote in five phases, with the first on November 30 and the last on December 20. Results will be declared on December 23.</p>
      <p>The Jarkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the Congress and Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal had recently announced a pre-poll tie-up for the state with former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren as the alliance's CM face.</p>
      <p>The Congress will contest 31 seats out of 81 seats in the Jharkhand assembly.</p>
      <p>The RJD will contest on seven seats, while the largest chunk of the alliance share has gone to the JMM, which will contest elections on 43 seats.</p>
