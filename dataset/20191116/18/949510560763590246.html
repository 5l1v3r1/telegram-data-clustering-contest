      <p>BINGHAMTON (WBNG) — The American Legion Auxiliary (ALA) celebrated 100 years today, holding a ham dinner for members of the community and veterans to attend.</p>
      <p>The ALA was founded back on November 10, 1919, and has been helping support veterans, active military and their families ever since.</p>
      <p>The American Legion Post 1194 held the dinner, which was made extra special thanks to a donation for Floyd’s Rent-All in Endwell, who donated the linens used for the tables.</p>
      <p>To Legion members and officials, knowing the community support still remains after a century of service means the world.</p>
      <p>“It was very nice to know that there are people out there to support the women veterans and all veterans, not just the American Legion,” said former president Cheryl Miller. “It’s very important. Let the community know that we are all here and we are doing things for our veterans, not only are men veterans, but our women veterans, and for our community.”</p>
      <p>The dinner took six weeks to plan. Miller told 12 News she was expecting around 150 people to show up throughout the course of the meal.</p>
      <p>All proceeds for the event will go to women veterans at the Oxford Veterans Home.</p>
