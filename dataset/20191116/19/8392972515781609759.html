      <p>The ex Girls Aloud star made the charity appearance to introduce an emotional clip about a family who have been supported by a bereavement centre in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Bear's dad Liam, meanwhile, recently admitted he regards his ex as 'the most important person in his life'.</p>
      <p>The former couple split last year after a two-and-a-half-year relationship.</p>
      <p>Liam, 26, also said in his book Straight Talking that becoming a father in his twenties 'messed him up'.</p>

      <p>"Becoming a dad at such a young age, it's such a difficult thing," <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/liam-payne-says-cheryl-is-still-the-most-important-person-in-his-life/">he said</a>.</p>
      <p>"And I think I built fatherhood up so much in my head that it kind of messed me up to start with. I started in a bad place with it.</p>
      <p>He went on to say: "[Cheryl] is one of the most, if not the most, important people in my life.</p>
      <p>"I'm lucky I have someone who understands what I'm going through."</p>
