      <p>Ryan Giggs believes Wales' performance against Azerbaijan was one of the best of his reign as manager so far.</p>
      <p>Goals from Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson saw the visitors win 2-0 in Baku, a result that keeps Wales' Euro 2020 qualifying hopes firmly alive.</p>
      <p>And Giggs believes his players are on a roll having not lost in their last four qualifying matches ahead of Tuesday's showdown with Hungary in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the result is what counted. Getting the result was the priority but I’m also pleased with the performance," said Giggs</p>
      <p>"Of course you can improve on things, but overall with the circumstances and with the pressure, I'm really pleased with some individual performances and the performance of the team as well.</p>
      <p>"Some of the quality of play was outstanding. Since the Azerbaijan game at home we’ve improved.</p>

      <p>"We’ve played some difficult teams but overall the performances have improved.</p>
      <p>"We started to gain some sort of momentum which isn’t easy in international football because of the gaps in between the games.</p>
      <p>"The lads came into camp really confident. In the last few games, it doesn’t matter whose come in, they’ve all contributed.</p>
      <p>"It's up there, Azerbaijan is not an easy place to come, and also the pressure on the game, so it’s up there with one of our best performances."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/genius-new-gareth-bale-chant-17269089">Gareth Bale</a> started but was withdrawn on the hour mark, with the Real Madrid star being replaced by Aaron Ramsey who made his first international appearance for a year.</p>
      <p>And Giggs said the pair will be assessed ahead of the clash with Hungary.</p>
      <p>"We’ve still got to assess it. It couldn't have gone any better regarding minutes. Getting Gareth off pretty early and getting Aaron some minutes as well, when he came on he showed his quality and composure," he added.</p>
      <p>"It’s a quick turnaround. Gareth was blowing a little bit which you can expect, but hopefully I’ll have the option to start both on Tuesday all being well."</p>
