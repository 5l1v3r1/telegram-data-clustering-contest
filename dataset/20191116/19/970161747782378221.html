      </p>
      <p>Even though the former EastEnders star admitted that she’s ‘scared of everything’, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emily-atack/">Emily Atack</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/im-celebritys-emily-atack-backs-jacqueline-jossa-win-jungle-rooting-11136712/"> has thrown her support behind Jacqueline</a>, telling The Mirror: ‘I’m really supportive of Jacqueline Jossa, I think we’re a similar age and she’s been through quite a lot.</p>
      <p>‘I think she could really find some positives, so we’re rooting for her.’</p>
      <p>Ahead of her appearance in the I’m A Celebrity jungle, here’s everything you need to know about Jacqueline’s time on EastEnders.</p>
      <h3>Who did Jacqueline Jossa play in EastEnders?</h3>
      <p>Jacqueline, 27, played Lauren Branning on the BBC soap for eight years from the time she took over the role from Madeline Duggan in 2010 until 2018.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Lauren is the eldest daughter of Tanya Cross (Jo Joyner) and Max Branning (Jake Wood).</p>
      <p>Over the years, her storylines have included hitting her father with her car, helping her mother through cervical cancer, having a son with Peter Beale (Ben Hardy), and falling from the roof of the Queen Vic with her sister Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald).</p>

      <p>While Lauren survived the fall, poor Abi did not.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/16/eastenders-spoilers-lauren-branning-exits-walford-without-josh-hemmings-7313485/">Lauren ended up leaving Walford</a> with her son on the day of her sister’s funeral.</p>
      <p>She headed to New Zealand, where her on-off ex-boyfriend Peter Beale (Ben Hardy) lives, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/18/where-is-lauren-branning-and-is-she-returning-to-eastenders-10422353/">the door was left open</a> for her to possibly return one day,</p>

      <p>On the subject of leaving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-didnt-tell-young-kids-heading-jungle-stint-11081701/">her family behind and heading to the jungle</a>, Jacqueline – who’s married to Dan Osborne – said: ‘This is definitely the longest I have ever been away from them and that is going to be really hard.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t know how to face even telling them,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>‘In the end, I thought the best idea was to say, “mummy is going away for work”, and I would see them soon.</p>
      <p>‘My family is so close-knit and I will miss them all terribly.’</p>
