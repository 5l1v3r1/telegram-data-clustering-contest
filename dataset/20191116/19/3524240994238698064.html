        <b>Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta </b>
      </p>
      <p>The governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement in the last governorship election in Ogun State, Adekunle Akinlade has announced his plans to head to the Supreme Court to challenge the victory of the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun.</p>
      <p>The Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State had on November 11, 2019, dismissed the application filed by Akinlade to challenge Abiodun’s victory on the grounds that the application lacks merit.</p>
      <p>Akinlade, while addressing his supporters at the party secretariat in Abeokuta on Saturday said he believes in the legal system of Nigeria despite the two previous judgments that did not favour him.</p>
      <p>He stated that the plans to proceed to the supreme court was decided by elders and leaders across the state.</p>
      <p>The governor hopeful claimed that his counsel has studied the  reasons alluded by the Court of Appeal for upholding the rulings of the election tribunal.</p>
      <p>Akinlade however appealed to the party faithful to continue praying for the victory of the party at the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>He said “As you all know, we rightfully decided to challenge the governorship election result of March 9th, 2019. Subsequently, the Election Petition Tribunal and Court of Appeal dismissed our petition on the grounds that the cornerstone of our case was a pre-election matter thus, status bar.</p>
      <p>“Our conviction and belief in the legal system remain unshaken despite the two previous judgments. Yesterday, the 15th of November, 2019, elders and leaders across the state met and unanimously agreed that we must approach the Supreme Court to test the strength of our case.</p>
      <p>“Our counsel has studied the reasons alluded to by the Court of Appeal for upholding the rulings of the lower court (election tribunal) and advised us accordingly.</p>
      <p>” I therefore, state that we shall be approaching the Supreme Court for justice.”</p>
