      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>WAYNE HENNESSEY 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Barely tested, but dealt with set-pieces well and was more than happy to go long when required. A very comfortable night for the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CONNOR ROBERTS 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>A very busy shift from the right-back who also stung the palms of Emil Balayev in the opening half. Gave so much support to the attackers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CHRIS MEPHAM 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bournemouth centre-back had a couple of nervy moments in the opening exchanges, but he was otherwise solid on his return to international duty. Needs more minutes under his belt to get back to peak form.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOM LOCKYER 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another promising showing from the Charlton defender who embodied Ryan Giggs' style when playing out from the back. Survived a penalty appeal in the first half, but it was another top display from Lockyer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BEN DAVIES 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Didn't put a foot wrong all night and showed all of his experience to help ensure Hennessey was relatively untroubled. Got forward well and passing played a key part in getting his side on the attack.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JOE MORRELL 8 - Star Man</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fine effort from distance early on and looked slick in possession throughout. Performed very well in the absence of Joe Allen. Booked late on, but it was a top display from the central midfielder.</p>

      <p>
        <b>ETHAN AMPADU 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Typically busy in the centre of the park but earned a booking for his troubles in the 13th minute. Won so many 50:50s to help keep Wales in control. Replaced.</p>
      <p>
        <b>GARETH BALE 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looked full of confidence on the right flank and terrorised the Azerbaijan defence at times. Didn't get the goal his efforts warranted, although fans will hope he's saving them for Hungary. Subbed.</p>

      <p>
        <b>HARRY WILSON 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had a decent chance after seven minutes, but his corner was on the money for Kieffer Moore to head home. The Bournemouth man was on hand himself to score his third international goal just after the half hour mark. Brilliantly denied in the second half too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DANIEL JAMES 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>The winger's pace always had the Azerbaijan defence on the back foot. He was so unlucky not to score, although Wilson was on hand to head home the rebound from James' stunning strike. Often marked by two players such were his threats. Subbed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KIEFFER MOORE 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Held up the ball brilliantly and notched his second international goal to put Wales ahead after 10 minutes. Had two headers saved in quick succession before being denied by the legs of Balayev after going through on goal. More chances in the second half too, but it was a fine effort from the Wigan man.</p>

        <b>Subs</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey (for Bale) - Making his first Wales appearance in a year, the Juventus man looked full of confidence in the No. 10 role for the last 30 minutes. A huge plus for Ryan Giggs. 6</p>
      <p>Rabbi Matondo (for James) - Too late to make an impact. N/A</p>
      <p>Will Vaulks (for Ampadu) - Helped see out the game. N/A</p>
