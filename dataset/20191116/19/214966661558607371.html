      <p>AN 84-year-old woman has been attacked by an intruder in the bedroom of her retirement village unit in Sydney.</p>
      <p>The terrifying encounter happened around 12.25pm yesterday, when the elderly woman returned to her unit on Bobbin Head Road in North Turramurra and found the unknown male in her bedroom.</p>
      <p>Police say the man then seriously assaulted the woman, before he fled out the front door of the premises.</p>
      <p>Emergency services rushed to the scene and treated the elderly lady for multiple serious injuries and lacerations to her face, chest and arm.</p>
      <p>She was then taken to Sydney Adventist Hospital, where she remains in a serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>A crime scene has since been established at the property.</p>
      <p>Police are appealing for anyone who observed anything suspicious in the area at the time, or anyone who may have been in the area with dashcam footage, to contact officers immediately.</p>
