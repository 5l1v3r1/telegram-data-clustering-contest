      <h1>Nicolas Cage Could Score a Massive Payday Playing... Nicolas Cage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:11:41+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author">Math Erao</a></address>
      <p>Nicholas Cage is in talks to star as himself—and earn a huge payday—in the absurdly meta film <i>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626">The Hollywood Reporter</a> revealed Cage is being eyed for the new film, directed by Tom Gormican and written by Gormican and Kevin Etten. The plot would not only borrow many elements from Cage's actual life, but it will reference Cage films like <i>Face/Off </i>and <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>. What's more, but interest in the film is apparently so high that Cage could pull in money he hasn't seen since the days of <i>National Treasure</i>.</p>

      <p>In the film, Cage will attempt to land a part in the latest <a href="https://screenrant.com/tarantino-inglourious-basterds-spinoff-killer-crow-cancelled-reason/amp/">Quentin Tarantino</a> film. At the same time, he'll be struggling to reconcile with his young daughter and overcome a mountain of debt. Along the way, the character will be recruited by the CIA to investigate a drug lord posing as a billionaire that Cage befriends.</p>
      <p>On top of all of the real-life elements and meta nods, not to mention the action-adventure plot, Cage will also be mocked by a self-obsessed version of himself from the '90s. There's no word on how the film will be altered if Cage doesn't take the part.</p>

      <p>Gormican sent Cage the script along with a letter to the actor, both of which convinced Cage to enter negotiations to join the film. Apparently, the movie will be more of a tribute to Cage than something poking fun at him.</p>
