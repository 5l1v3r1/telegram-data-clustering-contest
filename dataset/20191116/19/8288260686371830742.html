      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | The pair both joined AVFC in the summer and have been regular figures for manager Dean Smith in the Premier League this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:54:14+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba says he is not surprised by the ability of one of his team-mates.</p>
      <p>Nakamba moved to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> Park in the summer from Belgian outfit Club Brugge, and has had a good start to life in the claret and blue.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe international was joined at B6 in the summer by midfielder Douglas Luiz, who was signed from fellow Premier League side Manchester City.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Brazilian has netted two goals for Villa since joining the club in the summer, long-range efforts which came against Bournemouth and Norwich City.</p>
      <p>And Nakamba says he is no longer surprised to see the ball find the back of the net from Luiz’s long-range efforts, as it is something the Brazilian frequently practices in training.</p>
