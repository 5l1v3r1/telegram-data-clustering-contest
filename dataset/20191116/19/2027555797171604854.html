      <h1>Maha Guv announces financial relief for farmers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:23:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Saturday announced financial relief to farmers whose crop was damaged in unseasonal rains, and ordered its immediate disbursal.</p>
      <p>The relief entails Rs 8,000 per hectare up to two hectares for agricultural Kharif crops and Rs 18,000 per hectare up to two hectares for horticulture/perennial crops, an official statement said.</p>
      <p>The governor also exempted wards of the affected agriculturists from paying the educational fees, it said.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra has been under President's Rule since November 12, as no political party could form a government in the wake of a fractured mandate in the assembly polls that failed to elect a clear winner.</p>
      <p>The governor reviewed crop losses caused by untimely rains in various parts of the state during the months of October and November, the statement said.</p>
      <p>"The Governor has also announced exemptions of land revenue to the affected area and examination fee of school and colleges to the wards of affected farmers," it said.</p>
      <p>The governor also directed the state administration to disburse the relief immediately, it added.</p>
      <p>The then chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, had on November 2 approved Rs 10,000 crore as a special assistance for affected farmers.</p>
      <p>The NCP and the Congress had termed the assistance "meagre" and demanded it be raised to at least Rs 25,000 crore.</p>
      <p>Unseasonal rains and delayed retreat of monsoon had damaged Kharip crops of farmers in many districts, with Marathwada and North Maharashtra regions bearing the brunt.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Congress leader Ashok Chavan on Saturday said the assistance announced by the governor was "inadequate".</p>
      <p>"However, the administration should deposit this assistance in the accounts of farmers immediately. Additional relief will be declared when a government, of which Congress will be a part, is formed," Chavan said in a statement.</p>
      <p>At present, the Congress and the NCP are working out the possibility of forming a coalition government in alliance with the Shiv Sena, hitherto their arch rival in politics.</p>
      <p>Measures like a complete loan waiver for farmers were reportedly discussed ahead of finalising the draft Common Minimum Programme (CMP) for the three parties.</p>
      <p>NCP leader Dhananjay Munde said the affected farmers need a substantial financial aid that commensurates with the extent of the damage caused to their crops.</p>
