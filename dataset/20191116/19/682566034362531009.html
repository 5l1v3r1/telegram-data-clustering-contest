      <p>Brussels -Â Dutch cycling ace <b>Mathieu van der Poel</b> fought back tears on Saturday after he won a <b>World Cup cyclo-cross event</b> in the Czech Republic just three days after his legendary grandfather <b>Raymond Poulidor's</b> death.</p>
      <p>Poulidor, who died aged 83 on Wednesday, is a household name and national hero in France after finishing on the Tour de France podium eight times, winning the hearts of rural France without ever having won the event itself.</p>
      <p>Van der Poel is world cyclo-cross champion, European mountain bike champion and winner of this year's edition of road racing's prestigious Amstel Gold classic.</p>
      <p>"It's been a tough week, a very painful one," the tearful 24-year-old told Flemish television.</p>
      <p>"I hope you enjoyed the race up there," he wrote on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Despite his Tour de France disappointments, Poulidor ranks among France's cycling greats and is seen as a humble hard worker loved by the people who earned every one of his many triumphs.</p>
      <p>The multi-discipline Van der Poel is tipped by many inside the sport to avenge his grandfather and eventually win the Tour de France.</p>
      <p>Poulidor will be given a funeral in his hometown village in rural central France on Wednesday.</p>
