      <h2>Zara Tindall will start her new role at the beginning of next year, and it's something shes very, very passionate about</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:08:30+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey Lifestyle Editor, Carl Eve</a></address>
      <p>As a non-working member of the <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/royal-family">Royal Family</a>, Zara Tindall has been able to carve her own path in life - including a very, very impressive career.</p>
      <p>The equestrian champion has a number of achievements to her name, including a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics, when her proud family cheered her on.</p>
      <p>And now the Queen's eldest grandaughter is set to have yet another feather in her cap as she prepares to become a director at Cheltenham Racecourse.</p>
      <p>She is believed to be the first member of the royal family to take up such a role, and she's looking forward to using the opportunity to get involved.</p>

      <p>Zara said: "I’m passionate about horseracing, particularly on the Jumps side, and the absolute pinnacle of that is Cheltenham.</p>
      <p>"Racing is simply the most exciting sport and it’s open to all.</p>
      <p>"It’s an honour to have been asked by Martin St Quinton on behalf of The Jockey Club to get involved in a more formal capacity and I look forward to doing my bit to support the executive team in the years to come."</p>
      <p>Zara, who is a regular at the racecourse, will officially take up the non-executive role on Home of Jump Racing on New Year’s Day – its first fixture of 2020.</p>
      <p>She will be tasked with supporting the chairman and executive in the running of the racecourse, which is part of The Jockey Club.</p>

      <p>As well as competing, Zara has owned, bred and pre-trained several racehorses, just as her grandmother the Queen has done.</p>
      <p>Martin St Quinton, chairman of the Cheltenham Racecourse Committee, added: " Zara is a wonderful advocate for our sport and I’m delighted that she has agreed to join us at Cheltenham Racecourse.</p>
      <p>"I’m sure we will benefit significantly from her breadth of experience and a perspective that will prove invaluable to the racecourse.</p>

      <p>Zara, who is mum to Mia and Lena, still regularly competes in competitions and suffered a nasty fall at the Burghley Horse Trials earlier this year.</p>
      <p>She fell off her 10-year-old horse during the annual event.</p>
      <p>Husband Mike Tindall is almost always in the crowds cheering her on along with the couple's two children, who always make the most of the fun summer events.</p>
