      <h1>Arsenal could face battle to sign £31m-rated Real Madrid loanee Ceballos permanently</h1>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/arsenal-quale-futuro-per-ceballos-il-milan-spera-84156">Calciomercato</a> via Spanish newspaper AS, the future of Dani Ceballos at Real Madrid is yet to be sorted out – the midfielder’s bad relationship with Zinedine Zidane makes it unlikely for the ace to return as long as the Frenchman is boss.</p>
      <p>The Gunners could face a battle keep hold of the talented midfielder though as AS report that European giants AC Milan remain interested in the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>As per <a href="https://sempremilan.com/report-milan-still-keen-on-spain-midfielder-as-arsenal-see-e30m-bid-rejected">Sempre Milan via Gazzetta dello Sport</a>, Ceballos was one of Milan’s midfield targets this summer but he ultimately decided to join the Gunners on loan.</p>
      <p>AS’ report also claims that Arsenal have already had an initial bid of €30m to make the Spaniard’s loan permanent rejected by Los Blancos, this could open the door for Milan to make a swoop for the star.</p>
      <p>The Sun report via <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10353957/dani-ceballos-refuse-return-real-madrid-under-zidane-arsenal/">AS</a> that £31m (€36m) would be enough to convince Real Madrid to permanently part with the versatile midfielder.</p>

      <p>Unai Emery and Stefano Pioli could benefit massively from securing the signing of a player that has bags of potential. It will be interesting to see if Milan act on their interest to rival the Gunners for the ace’s signature.</p>
      <p>Ceballos has made 17 appearances for Arsenal across all competitions so far this season. The attacking midfielder has scored one goal and registered two assists in these outings.</p>
