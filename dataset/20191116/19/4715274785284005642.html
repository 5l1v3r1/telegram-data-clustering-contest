      <p>Financial technology startup PearlPay has signed a strategic partnership with the Association of Pangasinan Rural Banks as part of its push to enable financial institutions to be more commercially competitive through digital transformation.</p>
      <p>The agreement was signed during the 62nd Charter anniversary symposium of the Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines at the Manila Hotel. It allows 16 member banks of APRUB to access PearlPay’s end-to-end cloud-based banking solutions, namely Core Banking Solutions, Agent Banking Solutions and white-label e-wallet solutions.</p>
      <p>“Rural banks have proven to be important vehicles in the overall development of the Philippine economy as they cater to the financing needs of farmers, fisherfolk, and rural communities for financial inclusion,” Spark Perreras, co-founder and CEO of PearlPay, said. </p>
      <p>“As a fintech company, one of our core goals is to empower these institutions with digital solutions that allow them to streamline processes, scale operations and reach customers,” he said.</p>
