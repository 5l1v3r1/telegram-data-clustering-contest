      <h1>The heartwarming tale of how a crippled donkey became a running champion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:02:42+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Spitznagel</a></address>
      <p>In 2002, Christopher McDougall swapped city living in Philadelphia for a remote log cabin in Pennsylvania Amish country.</p>
      <p>He and his family had a few farm animals, a cat, some goats and a “starter sheep,” and they wanted to add a donkey to the mix.</p>
      <p>When McDougall heard about a 200-pound specimen who needed rescuing from a hoarder’s home, he thought he’d be bringing home an oversized pet.</p>
      <p>But then he laid eyes on the beast.</p>
      <p>“It looked dazed, more like a moldy toy hauled out of a basement than a living creature,” McDougall writes in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Running-Sherman-Donkey-Heart-Hero-ebook/dp/B07NKPW2NP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Running+with+Sherman%3A+The+Donkey+with+the+Heart+of+a+Hero&amp;qid=1573856376&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=nypost-20">Running with Sherman: The Donkey with the Heart of a Hero</a>” (Knopf), out now. And its hooves had been so badly neglected “he could barely walk.”</p>
      <p>McDougall adopted him anyway and named him Sherman.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t care anymore about getting a pet,” he writes. “All we cared about was getting him out of there.”</p>
      <p>McDougall didn’t know anything about rehabilitating a donkey, but he was an expert on one topic: running. His 2009 bestseller “Born to Run” inspired the barefoot-running movement.</p>
      <p>“My gut told me that the one thing that would save Sherman . . . was movement,” he writes.</p>
      <p>But whenever McDougall tried to jog Sherman, the donkey hesitated. His crippled hooves, which had to be trimmed with a hacksaw, could barely stand on even slightly uneven terrain.</p>
      <p>“The more I tried to boss him around, the more he would resist,” McDougall writes. “There was no way I was going to out-donkey a donkey.”</p>
      <p>So McDougall brought in running partners, first a grumpy white goat named Chili Dog and then a pair of donkeys named Flower and Matilda, along with a couple of human trainers. The goal, McDougall writes, was to “combine their strengths and weaknesses into one big Swiss Army knife of a support system” — and the team brought Sherman out of his shell.</p>

      <p>As Sherman got stronger and more confident, McDougall decided on an ambitious goal. They would compete in the annual World Championship Pack Burro Race, a legendary contest that’s been hosted in Fairplay, Colo., since 1949. Donkeys and their human partners, who run beside the animals, race up to the 13,185-foot Mosquito Pass — nearly half the height of Mount Everest — and back.</p>
      <p>The Fairplay donkeys are “all tough, mountain-hardened beasts who could run for days and shrug off a tsunami,” McDougall writes. The strategy for Sherman “was to trot slowly and be happy with finishing dead last, as long as we finished.”</p>
      <p>After less than a year of training, the day of the big burro race finally arrived: July 31, 2016.</p>
      <p>As they joined the other donkeys at the starting point, Sherman was so excited that “his fur seemed to be standing on end.”</p>
      <p>At first, Sherman was “so enthralled to be flowing along in a donkey parade, he was nearly bouncing.” But at the halfway point, stocked with water bottles for humans and a trough for donkeys, Sherman balked.</p>
      <p>As Flower and Matilda moved on, McDougall knew only one thing would motivate Sherman.</p>
      <p>“Let’s go,” he announced to the group. “We’re leaving him.”</p>
      <p>Sure enough, Sherman finally gave up and raced towards them.</p>
      <p>During the final stretch, they “clawed and scrambled our way up a slippery bank, our feet churning through crushed dirt as soft as sand.” And then they saw it, the finish line.</p>
      <p>“Ready for your victory parade, Sherman?” McDougall asked.</p>
      <p>Sherman finished in the top 30 out of 52 starters. It was a remarkable achievement for a donkey once terrified to leave his pen.</p>
      <p>But, McDougall concludes, “Sherman was born with the badlands in his blood.”</p>
      <p>Although Sherman is now retired from burro racing, he still lives on McDougall’s farm and is as feisty as ever. Sometimes he’ll throw open the gate with his teeth.</p>
      <p>“Then he’ll lead all the animals out to escape and wander down to the road. It’s almost like he’s looking for his next race.”</p>
