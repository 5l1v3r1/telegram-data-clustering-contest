      <h1>Liverpool fans react to Harry Wilson’s performance for Wales</h1>

      <p>Harry Wilson starred in Wales’ victory against Azerbaijan on Saturday evening – and some Liverpool fans on Twitter praised the performance of their loanee.</p>
      <p>Wilson is currently on a season-long loan at Bournemouth after being sent out by Jurgen Klopp’s team to continue his development in the top-flight.</p>
      <p>The left-footed winger scored and assisted during a 2-0 away victory for Ryan Giggs’ Welsh outfit.</p>
      <p>His corner was powered in by Kieffer Moore’s powerful header, before he reacted quickly in front of goal to tap in his own header to an empty net.</p>
      <p>Wilson has started the campaign in decent form at club level, where he’s scored four times in 13 games across all competitions.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old is also beginning to become a regular in the senior Wales team and his reputation is growing.</p>
      <p>He is a wide man that usually prefers on the right flank and is a major threat when he cuts inside to his favoured left foot, but played in a more central role against Azerbaijan.</p>

      <p>A selection of Liverpool supporters on social media were delighted to see their loanee impress on the international stage and are excited for his return to Anfield next year.</p>
      <p>His loan spell with Bournemouth has gone exactly to plan so far and there is no reason why he couldn’t be a strong addition to Jurgen Klopp’s squad moving forward.</p>
      <p>Here are some Liverpool fans reacting to Wilson:</p>
