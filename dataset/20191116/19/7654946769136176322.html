      <p>Chicago public school teachers approved the contract agreement that ended the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/17/chicago-teachers-strike-cancels-classes-for-more-than-300000-students/">11-day strike</a> that shut down classes in the country’s third largest school district last month.</p>
      <p>The Chicago Teachers Union Friday ratified the contract late Friday, which will boost pay and put a nurse and social worker in every school. The agreement now goes to the city’s Board of Education Wednesday, The Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>The agreement will also provide money to enforce limits on class size.</p>
      <p>“This contract is a powerful advance for our city and our movement for real equity and educational justice for our school communities and the children we serve,” Jesse Sharkey, the president of the teachers union, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“We live in one of the richest cities in the wealthiest nation in the world, and finally Chicago must start investing in the future of our city — our children.”</p>
