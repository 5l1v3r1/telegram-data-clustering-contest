      <p>On Saturday, the Penn State Nittany Lions took the field against the Indiana Hoosiers to a frenzy crowd who were having a great time all game long.</p>
      <p>During one part of the game, a fan decided they were going to bring a condom inside the stadium, not for protection for what it’s created for, but to blow it up like a balloon and throw it down to the field.</p>
      <p>That condom balloon not only made it, but scored a TD as the fans went wild.</p>
