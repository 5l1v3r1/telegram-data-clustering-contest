      <h1>Ryan Lowe praises defensive resilience of his Plymouth Argyle players after win at Forest Green Rovers</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims beat the League Two leaders 1-0 with a goal from midfielder Antoni Sarcevic</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:00:40+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Manager Ryan Lowe highlighted the way his Plymouth Argyle players put their bodies on the line in the 1-0 win away to League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims</a> had to withstand heavy late pressure from Forest Green, including a flurry of corners and goalmouth scrambles.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s third league win in their last four games saw them move up to 11th place in the table, only a couple of points outside the play-off positions.</p>
      <p>It came after they went to Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup first round last weekend and also triumphed 1-0.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s winning goal was a move off the training ground as Antoni Sarcevic played a short corner with Danny Mayor in the 24th minute.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic fired a fierce deflected shot past Forest Green goalkeeper Joe Wollacott and that proved to be the difference between the two sides at the final whistle.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “It was a fantastic performance, especially in the second half with backs against the wall and dogged defending.</p>
      <p>“What I’m seeing of these boys, they are putting their bodies on the line.</p>
      <p>“We have gone a goal up with a well-worked set piece, and that’s pleasing. I would have liked us to keep the ball a little bit better in certain areas.</p>
      <p>“But sometimes you can’t do that. You are coming to the league leaders and they are a very good side.</p>
      <p>“They had wide free-kicks, throw-ins and corners and my players were coming out and clearing and taking whacks, and whatever else.</p>
      <p>“That showed me the boys are determined to keep clean sheets and they want to make sure they keep the points on the board.”</p>

      <p>Argyle lost Callum McFadzean and substitute Joe Riley to leg injuries in what was a fiercely competitive contest.</p>
      <p>McFadzean was replaced for the start of the second half by Riley, who did not last long before he had to be taken off too.</p>
      <p>Lowe did not want to dwell on those injuries, though, after Argyle’s hard-fought win.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims’ boss revealed that Sarcevic’s goal had not come by chance but it had been planned for in training.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s your work, it’s what we do. My players certainly do the work, and my staff certainly do the work. When it pays off like that it’s pleasing.”</p>
      <p>The back-to-back victories over Bolton and Forest Green are an encouraging sign for Argyle but Lowe believes there is still a lot of room for improvement from his side.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: "We can get better at everything. We are getting better at game management, we are getting better at putting bodies on the line, we are getting better at seeing games out.</p>
      <p>"We are getting better at passing the ball and moving it through the thirds, through the lines.</p>
      <p>"Every day is a learning day for us, and every game is a learning game for us. We are not going to get carried away.</p>
      <p>"But, listen, I will enjoy tonight because we have come to the league leaders and beat them 1-0."</p>
      <p>Lowe continued: "Some of them are in there (away dressing room) now bruised, battered and they are hobbling, but they have put their bodies in the line for three points.</p>
      <p>"It will taste nicer tonight when they get home to their families and have a glass of red wine or pint of beer, whatever it may be. They have worked hard all week for a result on Saturday afternoon."</p>
