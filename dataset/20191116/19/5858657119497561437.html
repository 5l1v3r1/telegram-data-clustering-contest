      <p>ATLANTA — Drought continues to recede in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina.</p>
      <p>Almost one third of South Carolina and more than one third of Georgia recorded no drought as of Tuesday. Last week, only 9% of Georgia and 24% of South Carolina could make that claim. In Alabama, 70% of the state is now drought-free.</p>
      <p>Areas of moderate and severe drought also declined.</p>
      <p>The University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s drought monitor says rain fell across the eastern United States. Much of the Southeast received more rain this week.</p>
      <p>High heat and little rainfall spread a quick-developing drought across the South in late summer.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 1, all of Alabama and Georgia were in drought, along with almost all of Mississippi and all but the northeastern corner of South Carolina. Rains quenched Mississippi’s drought earlier.</p>
