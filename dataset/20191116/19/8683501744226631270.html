      <p>At this point, there isn’t much that Kelly Clarkson hasn’t accomplished. She’s sold millions of albums, won Grammys, and with stints on <i>The Voice</i> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2482951/apparently-people-are-really-loving-kelly-clarksons-new-talk-show">her own talk show</a>, she’s cemented her position as a pop icon. Kelly Clarkson is even a movie star -- though that’s something she’d rather not talk about. In fact, her experience making 2003’s ill-fated <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/What-Kelly-Clarkson-Actually-Thinks-From-Justin-Kelly-71603.html"><i>From Justin to Kelly</i></a> was so bad, she was sure the movie would ruin her career before it really even started.</p>
      <p><i>From Justin to Kelly</i> was released just months after Kelly Clarkson bested <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Justin-Guarini-Starving-Death-He-Romeo-Juliet-Broadway-58357.html">Justin Guarini</a> for the inaugural <i>American Idol</i> crown. It was the first (and only) film made to capitalize on the singing competition’s enormous popularity -- because the romantic movie-musical was universally panned and bombed at the box office. And Kelly Clarkson told <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-cried-so-hard-over-from-justin-to-kelly-movie-i-thought-it-was-going-to-ruin-my-singing-career-203414779.html">Yahoo! News</a> that the whole process was horrifying for her:</p>
      <blockquote>I mean, I cried. I tried so hard to get out of that film. When we all made the [<i>American Idol</i> Season 1] top 10, they informed us that whoever won the show had to do this movie musical. And I was like, 'I don't really want to be an actor.' Like, that's not a dream of mine. I came on a singing competition, and I was already worried about it. And then when it came down to the top two, Justin really wanted to do the movie and I didn't, so we were kind of hoping he’d win so I didn't have to! And then he loved it, so they were like, 'Well, why don't we just make it the two of y'all?'</blockquote>
      <p>According to Kelly Clarkson, there was no way for the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/tag/american-idol/"><i>American Idol</i></a> alums to avoid making <i>From Justin to Kelly</i>, despite her reservations:</p>
      <blockquote>I cried so hard to get out of that. But in the contract I had to, because I won. And I love movie musicals — I have such an amazing amount appreciation for that kind of talent — but I don't feel like that's my talent, necessarily. So, you know, I was miserable shooting it, and I didn't want to do it. I thought it was going to ruin my singing career.</blockquote>
      <p>Even though <i>From Justin to Kelly</i> was as bad as she expected it to be, the movie didn’t ruin <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/1581519/listen-to-kelly-clarkson-sing-hamiltons-its-quiet-uptown-and-try-not-to-cry">her singing career</a>. And now, more than 15 years later, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/2470021/kelly-clarkson-says-she-was-mistaken-for-a-seat-filler-at-the-acm-awards">Kelly Clarkson</a> knows <i>From Justin to Kelly</i> has become a part of the so-bad-it’s-good canon -- she told Yahoo! News that even her nanny is a fan. But making the film caused her so much stress, she still can’t get in on the joke. So, it’s safe to say she probably <i>won’t</i> be setting foot on a movie set any time soon.</p>
