      <p>The Delhi Congress on Saturday organised a ‘Halla Bol’ rally to protest against the BJP for “economic slowdown” and “large-scale unemployment” in the country.</p>
      <p>Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) chief Subhash Chopra said, “The country is facing its worst economic crisis since Independence due to the anti-people policies of the Narendra Modi government.
