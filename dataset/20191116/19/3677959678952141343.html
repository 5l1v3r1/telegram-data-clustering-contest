      <ul>
        <li>1000Hz Ultra Polling this feature makes sure the mouse is giving you the best response time, just around 1ms, very speedy response time when comparing other $25 mice on the market currently.</li>
        <li>3,500 Precision Infrared Sensor The 3,500 Infrared sensor is Razer's own precision Infrared sensor which allows for a very fast and ultra-fast high-resolution tracking which makes gaming with this mouse feel very smooth. This mouse also does offer on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment, this provides instant access to the changing sensitivity function of the mouse, with no needed driver installations.</li>
        <li>Ergonomic Design This Ergonomic design is amazing as it conforms to your hand shape in addition to the slip-resistant grip to make sure that you will always have your mouse in hand even during the hardest gaming session. These design choices allow for maximum comfort while gaming for longer times.</li>
        <li>Customizable Buttons The five buttons that are on this mouse button are completely customizable, everything from the mouse buttons along with the thumb buttons on the left side.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the crazy low price point of just $25.54 on Newegg.com but still showing as $44 on <a href="https://amzn.to/3595nCS">Amazon</a>, makes this mouse a very good deal for the budget gamer looking to do some upgrading this Black Friday. On top of that deal, on Newegg, there is also a promo code of MKTCBL which gives you an extra 5% off the already lowered price if you plan to spend more than $100.Â The features that this mouse provides far surpass any other $25 or $20 mouse on the market at this point.</p>
      <p>I suggest getting this mouse while there is still a chance to get it because I can only assume that the stock of this mouse will not last long!</p>
