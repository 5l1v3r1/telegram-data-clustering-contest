      <h1>Ernesto Valverde considers Barcelona defender ‘transferable’, report claims</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:12:51+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191116/471623352150/valverde-prefiere-araujo-a-todibo.html">Mundo Deportivo</a>, Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde sees talented defender Jean-Clair Todibo as ‘transferable’ given the emergence of Barcelona B prospect Ronald Araujo.</p>
      <p>Uruguay youth international Araujo arrived in Catalonia from Boston River in January for a fee of €1.7m according to Mundo Deportivo.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has been making waves for the B team and was awarded his first-team debut in last week’s 4-0 win against Sevilla.</p>
      <p>Araujo actually replaced Todibo in the 73rd minute but his debut lasted just 14 minutes as he was sent off for a challenge on former Manchester United star Javier Hernandez.</p>
      <p>The ace could be handed more chances in the first-team given Samuel Umtiti’s injury problems.</p>

      <p>A report from <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191115/471607429185/cuanto-valdria-fichar-ahora-a-ronald-araujo.html">Mundo</a> on Araujo from last week also reveals that the ace’s release clause stands at €100m and it will automatically double should he become a permanent member of the first-team.</p>
      <p>It seems harsh to deem Todibo transferable considering that he’s barely had the chance to feature in the first-team because of the fierce competition for places between Gerard Pique, Clement Lenglet and Umtiti.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman looks as though he could have plenty of upside if he’s developed correctly.</p>
      <p>It would certainly be a risky move for the club to sell the youngster anytime soon given how much a young player’s value can sky-rocket in a short amount of time.</p>
