      <p>That was the word Saturday from Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson.</p>
      <p>Fajardo, who was recently named the West Division’s most outstanding player, has been dealing with an oblique injury that he sustained in practice on Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>“He’s shown that he’s healthy,” Dickenson said. “He’s going to have some soreness and some stiffness, but he has shown that he can execute and run the offence the way he needs to, so we feel like he’s going to be good.”</p>
      <p>Dickenson added: “We feel like if he’s not 100 per cent, he’s close.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo also noted some progress, saying: “It feels good … All things considered, it’s feeling probably the best that I’ve felt since the injury.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo was forced to miss the Roughriders’ regular-season finale due to the injury. In that Nov. 2 game, Isaac Harker started at quarterback for Saskatchewan and helped his team defeat the visiting Edmonton Eskimos 23-13.</p>
      <p>That victory allowed Saskatchewan (13-5) to clinch first place in the West for the first time in 10 years, and for only the second time in a span of 43 seasons.</p>
