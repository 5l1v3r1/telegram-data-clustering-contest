      <h1>Peter King defends Trump, rails against Ilhan Omar in exit interview</h1>

      <p>The first thing you see when you walk into Rep. Peter King’s plush D.C. office is a large framed photo of the Twin Towers engulfed in smoke and flame.</p>
      <p>In many ways, that moment has defined his 28-year career in Congress, which the Long Island Republican announced Monday will come to end next year when he retires to his home in Seaford.</p>
      <p>“Everything involving 9/11 I am proud of,” he said ticking off his work securing money for the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/29/trump-signs-9-11-victims-compensation-fund-into-law/">9/11 Victims Compensation Fund</a> and his deep connections to the families and first responders. “As congressmen, I lost about 170 people.”</p>
      <p>The tragedy led directly to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and a corresponding House committee King went on to chair from 2005 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2013. The job, and his broader work in the global war on terror, brought him into contact with Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto, Poland’s Lech Wałęsa, Israel’s Ehud Barak and even the Dalai Lama.</p>
      <p>And it led to grave realizations.</p>
      <p>“At any given moment, things can happen, seriously deadly things,” King warned, saying he became privy to a number of close calls he cannot discuss because they are classified.</p>
      <p>King did vividly remember a thwarted <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/02/would-be-nyc-subway-bomber-najibullah-zazi-to-be-released-on-time-served/">2009 plot to attack the New York City subway.</a> “If we had not intercepted information, thousands could have been killed,” he said, recalling a tense meeting with then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly before law enforcement had moved on those plotting a suicide bombing in Grand Central Station.</p>
      <p>King’s tough, no-nonsense approach to fighting terrorism often brought him into the crosshairs of Muslim advocacy groups. After announcing his retirement, freshman Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar blasted King as an <a href="https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1193925337379463169">“Islamophobe” and “McCarthyite”</a> over a series of controversial Homeland Security Committee hearings King held in 2011 on the “radicalization of the American Muslim community.”</p>
      <p>King brushed off <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/rep-ilhan-omar-glad-islamophobe-pete-king-is-retiring/">Omar’s criticism</a>, noting that her congressional district “has more people going over being recruited by Islamic terrorists than anyone else.</p>
      <p>“Obviously what she has said has been anti-Semitic,” King added, speaking of Omar’s past tweets and statements about Israel and Jewish issues. “[Anti-semitism] has become more acceptable in the [Democratic] party.”</p>
      <p>King speaks out on the most hot-button issues — not always tactfully.</p>
      <p>He called Michael Jackson a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-gH2gAXjAw&amp;feature=emb_title">“pervert” and “child molester</a>” shortly after the singer’s death. He still disagrees that Eric Garner was choked to death by cops. </p>
      <p>“He’s saying he can’t breathe, but if you can’t breathe you can’t talk,” King said during the hour-long sitdown with The Post.</p>
      <p>Garner died after being wrestled to the ground by Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo on July 17, 2014 in what the medical examiner ruled a “homicide.” Pantaleo was found to have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/19/nypd-fires-officer-daniel-pantaleo-in-chokehold-death-of-eric-garner/">used a “banned chokehold”</a> during an NYPD admnistrative trial and fired.</p>
      <p>“With Garner what was never reported was minority business owners … they said, ‘We gotta get this guy out of here,'” King said, adding he believes Pantaleo should not have been fired or even disciplined.</p>
      <p>“Just as was the case with Ferguson, Missouri,” he added, referring to 2014 death of Michael Brown. “‘Hands up, don’t shoot’ — we heard that for three months and turns out that was all lies.”</p>
      <p>Brown reportedly had his hands up when shot by police officer Darren Wilson, which led to the national rallying cry. A Justice Department investigation later concluded this was likely false.</p>
      <p>King first came to Congress when George H.W. Bush was in the White House. His departure in 2020, along with retiring veteran New York Democrats Nita Lowey and José E. Serrano,  will significantly reduce the power of the Empire State in Congress.</p>
      <p>Gleaming images on the wall of King with Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Donald Trump are also evidence of a more cooperative time, which King says is mostly gone today.</p>

      <p>“People say they want bipartisanship but when you do it you get called a traitor,” he said, noting the criticism New York Sen. Chuck Schumer took on Twitter Monday for praising King’s record.</p>
      <p>While King is no Trump toady — with notable disagreements on foreign policy — the Congressman remains steadfastly with the president and bullish about his chances of beating impeachment (in the Senate), winning the White House in 2020 — and even making gains in Congress.</p>
      <p>“Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. It’s part of US policy as we give aid that they be eliminating corruption,” King said, adding that he had no issue with the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/diplomat-overheard-trump-phone-call-discussing-investigations-in-ukraine/">phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president</a> Volodymyr Zelensky now at the heart of the Democratic impeachment in inquiry.</p>
      <p>“[Impeachment] is like the last-ditch nuclear option to use and it shouldn’t be for sex in Oval Office and it shouldn’t be for a phone call to the president of Ukraine,” King said, recalling his opposition to Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1999.</p>
      <p>And while many <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/12/path-to-removing-donald-trump-from-office-229911">pundits have speculated</a> that Trump would be abandoned by his party were the impeachment vote a secret, King said the opposite was true.</p>
      <p>“I could see a number of Democrats in a secret ballot voting for the president, even in the House,” he said. “There are a number of Democrats who wish we weren’t going ahead with impeachment.”</p>
      <p>King said Trump’s blunt style masks a softer side that outsiders rarely see. He glimpsed this in February, when the president learned King’s daughter Erin had breast cancer.</p>
      <p>“I mentioned it to him once and the next thing I know my daughter is shopping in Macy’s and he calls,” King remembered. “He just spoke to her for 10 or 15 minutes on the phone. He called himself. It wasn’t a White House operator.”</p>
      <p>The whole package makes Trump unbeatable in 2020, King says.</p>
      <p>“[Biden] just doesn’t seem up on his game,” King said, calling the former vice president the 2020 Dem “favorite” despite recent gains by Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “When you’re out of the arena, it’s hard to come back in. Life changes when you’re out.”</p>
      <p>King said that Michael Bloomberg could pose a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/michael-bloomberg-again-eyeing-2020-presidential-bid-sources/">formidable challenge</a>, but he has trouble seeing his path to the nomination: “I don’t see what Mike’s lane is in the Democratic primary today.”</p>
      <p>King and Bloomberg are chummy, with the billionaire hosting a fundraiser for him in 2018 — a race King won by only 15,000 votes.</p>
      <p>The Notre Dame University graduate and lawyer was adamant his retirement had nothing to do with the increasingly tough climate for northeastern Republicans. He predicted he would have cruised to victory if he wanted it. He believes his seat on Long Island’s south shore will stay Republican, but declined to endorse any of the potential candidates.</p>
      <p>Known in D.C. as a workaholic, King doesn’t golf and rarely vacations. He’s simply looking forward to more time with his wife Rosemary, two children, and two grandchildren.</p>
      <p>“I like being home,” he said. “Most of my free time is spent with a few friends and my grandchildren.”</p>
