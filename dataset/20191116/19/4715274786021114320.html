      <p>P.A.-Hankyu One, the joint venture of homegrown P.A. Properties and Osaka-based Hankyu Hanshin Properties Corp., welcomed its first batch of proud homeowners to their new homes in Dasmariñas City.</p>
      <p>To mark the hand-over ceremony, executives and representatives of P.A. Properties and Hankyu Hanshin Properties Corp. handed over the housing units to the first batch of residents while thanking them for choosing Idesia in their homeownership journey. </p>
      <p>“The hand-over ceremony signifies the start of our homeowners’ new life in a community where they will experience the serenity of countryside living while enjoying the convenience of urban lifestyle. For P.A.-Hankyu One, today is equally meaningful as we finally welcome our first batch of Idesia residents,” said P.A. Properties president Jonathan Lu. </p>
      <p>“We are equally appreciative of the patience and inspiring involvement of our homeowners and brokers in making sure that we all get to this day—one that matches the momentum that we can see and feel in the construction of the rest of the houses that will complete the Idesia community,” Lu said.</p>
      <p>The 37-hectare Idesia Dasmariñas township is the flagship project of the joint venture. </p>
