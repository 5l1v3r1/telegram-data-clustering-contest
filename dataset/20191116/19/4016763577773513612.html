      <h1>DaBaby Claims He Spent Half A Million On Music Videos This Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:22:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p>Out of all of <a href="https://genius.com/artists/dababy">DaBaby</a>’s calling cards, his run of music videos might be his most prominent. The Charlotte MC knows how to put an absurd twist on his outsize persona, and his visuals span <a href="https://genius.com/a/dababy-parodies-his-louis-vuitton-store-fight-in-the-carpet-burn-video">comedic sketches</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/a/dababy-opens-up-about-his-fathers-death-family-relationships-on-intro">cinematic vignettes</a>. Most recently, he turned <a href="https://genius.com/Dababy-bop-lyrics">“BOP”</a> into a “hip-hop musical” with a little help from Jabbawockeez. As it turns out, this eye-catching video production carries a hefty price tag.</p>
      <p>“I paid for every video I ever shot,” he told <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dababy-baby-of-the-year-901697/">Rolling Stone</a></i>. “$100,000 budget, $70,000, $60,000, I’ve probably spent like half a million dollars on videos this year, by myself, just me. I ain’t willing to settle for less… If you’re capable of being this caliber of an artist, do I want to settle for doing shit like this just to keep some money in my pocket and spend it on bullshit or something?”</p>

      <p>His latest <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Dababy/Kirk">KIRK</a></i> single was given the Broadway treatment by the Reel Goats crew, who’ve handled his past work. The one-take spectacular captures a huge crowd performing choreography, with a last-minute cameo by Jabbawockeez. The dance team trended on Twitter for several hours following the music video’s release.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview, he spoke about multitasking two of his biggest projects on the same day. “I think that I recorded [the <a href="https://genius.com/Dreamville-j-cole-and-lute-under-the-sun-lyrics">‘Under the Sun’</a> verse] the same day that I shot the <a href="https://genius.com/Dababy-suge-lyrics">‘Suge’</a> video, because we were shooting that video scene,” he continues. “I recorded it that same day with an engineer. It wasn’t the best engineer there, either. I probably would have went crazier. Buddy was slowing me down. He knew. He’s like, ‘Oh my God.’ I’m like, ‘Come on, bro. Punch me back in, brother, let’s go.”</p>
      <p>One of the Reel Goats directors previously <a href="https://genius.com/a/how-the-office-inspired-dababy-s-suge-music-video">revealed the source of inspiration</a> behind the “Suge” visual. “For whatever reason when he said the <a href="https://genius.com/artists/suge-knight">Suge Knight</a> thing, I thought of <i>The Office</i>,” the director told <i><a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/09/dababy-music-videos-reel-goats-interview">Complex</a></i>. “And I was just like, ‘Shit. You know how funny it would be to have known what Suge Knight was like in an office setting?’ My mind was solely focused on <i>The Office</i> for a while and then he kept saying, ‘I want to be a mailman.’”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://genius.com/a/watch-dababy-perform-intro-really-bop-on-the-tonight-show">DaBaby performed “BOP”</a> on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>.</p>
