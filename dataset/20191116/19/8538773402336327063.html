      <h1>Harry Wilson wows as Wales boost Euro 2020 hopes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:03:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>A goal and assist from <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/194801/Harry-Wilson">Harry Wilson</a> ensured Wales kept alive their hopes of automatic Euro 2020 qualification with a straightforward 2-0 win over Azerbaijan in Group E on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The on-loan Liverpool forward set up Kieffer Moore's headed opener in Baku with a 10th-minute corner to the far post and then headed home himself from close range on 34 minutes after <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/203072/Daniel-James">Daniel James</a>'s spectacular shot rebounded off the crossbar and upright. Wales also had a second-half effort from Tom Lockyer disallowed as they secured their first away win in more than a year. The victory moved Ryan Giggs' side, who are already guaranteed a playoff place, up to third in the group, one point ahead of Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Wales will qualify automatically if they beat second-placed Hungary in Cardiff in their final game and Slovakia drop points against Croatia later on Saturday or against Azerbaijan on Tuesday.</p>
