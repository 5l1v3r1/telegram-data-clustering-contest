      <p>Emma and Anton received a total of 37 after performing an American Smooth to Ella Fitzgerald's Let's Face The Music.</p>

      <p>His partner Katya Jones told him after they were voted out: "Honestly I’m so proud of him and I think after even this dance which I think was your best dance you can leave with your head held up honestly; and in my eyes you’re the winner. The only thing he has lost is weight.</p>
      <p>"He came in every single day giving his heart, soul, everything, 200% no matter what after every single dance off and thank you so much. I’m so sorry I couldn’t take to Blackpool."</p>
