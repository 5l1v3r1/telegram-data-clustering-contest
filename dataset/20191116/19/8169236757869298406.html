        <b>Romelu Lukaku has revealed that Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted to keep the Belgian forward at Old Trafford this summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lukaku joined Inter Milan during the summer transfer window, with the Belgian international impressing fans and critics alike with his performances for Antonio Conte’s side since.</p>
      <p>The ex-Red Devils man has bagged an impressive nine goals in 12 Serie A outings since his arrival at the San Siro, helping Inter keep up with Juventus in the race for the Scudetto.</p>
      <p>However, it seems things could’ve gone a lot differently for Lukaku, and United, had Solskjaer got his way in regards to the player’s future this summer.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-in/amp/news/lukaku-solsjaer-wanted-me-to-stay-but-i-made-decision-to/19mjtnp7vthx21s4ui47236jgq">Goal</a>, when speaking about his departure from United, Lukaku revealed “Solskjaer has my eternal respect. He understood me when I said in March that it was time for me to leave England. I have been in the Premier League as an 18-year-old boy and now I am 26. Solskjaer wanted to keep me, but I was ready for something new.”</p>

      <p>Given their record in front of goal so far this year, United could’ve done with Lukaku in their squad this season.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer only really has Martial and Rashford to choose from at striker this term, options that have left both him and United shorthanded when it comes to attacking options.</p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to see how for Lukaku can go whilst with Inter, and whether he can guide his new side to their first Serie A title in what seems like forever with his goals this term.</p>
