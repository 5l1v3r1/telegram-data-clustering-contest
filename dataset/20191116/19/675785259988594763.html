      <p>Selena Gomez has opened up about the cruel trolling she received after she gained weight following her Lupus diagnosis.</p>
      <p>The Come and Get It singer, 27, admitted the abuse she received "messed her up" as she struggled to deal with the condition.</p>
      <p>She has been fighting the life-threatening disease since 2013 and underwent chemotherapy and a kidney transplant to treat it.</p>
      <p>The medication she was taking meant she put on weight, something she says she was "attacked for".</p>
      <p>Speaking on Raquelle Stevens’ video podcast Giving Back Generation, she said: "It's the medication I have to take for the rest of my life — it depends on even the month, to be honest.</p>

      <p>"So for me, I really noticed when people started attacking me for that. And in reality, that's just my truth.</p>
      <p>"I fluctuate. It depends what's happening in my life.</p>
      <p>"That got to me big time. That really messed me up for a bit."</p>

      <p>Selena said she now doesn't open up as much on social media because of the criticism she gets.</p>
      <p>She continued: "I don't care to expose myself to everyone and hear what they have to say about it."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lupus">Lupus</a> is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system becomes overly active and attacks normal, healthy tissue.</p>

      <p>The condition is chronic and ranges from mild to severe. Lupus can affect any part of the body - so it could affect the skin, joints or internal organs.</p>
      <p>Selena's friend Francia donated a kidney to her in 2017.</p>
      <p>In an open <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> update, the star shared an image of herself on a hospital bed following her treatment.</p>
