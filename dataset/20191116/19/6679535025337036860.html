      <p>Two sisters have been arrested for their alleged involvement in cases of theft in south Delhi, the police said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said that the women — Lalita (25) and her younger sister Damini (22) are from Madhya Pradesh.</p>
      <p>The police said that the first case was registered on November 5 at Kotla Mubarakpur police station in which the complainant reported a theft of ₹50,000 inside a bank. The second case was reported from a temple in Chhatarpur the same day in which the complainant stated that he withdrew ₹50,000 after which he went to the temple and while returning, he found the money missing. A case was registered at Mehrauli police station.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage was scrutinised and two women were found moving in a suspicious manner. The suspects were identified and surveillance was mounted. “A tip-off was received that the women were in Pushp Vihar after which a trap was laid and they were apprehended,” Mr. Thakur said, adding that the stolen money was recovered from them.</p>
      <p>During interrogation, they allegedly told the police that they visited cities during festival and marriage seasons and targeted people in crowded places.</p>
