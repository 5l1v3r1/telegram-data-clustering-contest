      <h1>Vettel "carefully optimistic" for Brazilian Grand Prix as he starts from front row</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> was left wanting more as he qualified in second ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday, although the German was happy in the end to be on the front row.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vettel was just over a tenth off getting pole position, with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> getting his second career pole position at Interlagos for<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing"> Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a>.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman set the pace after the first run and then improved on it by over a tenth. Vettel couldn't improve in the second run, coming in three-tenths slower.</p>
      <p><i>"I had a bit of a wobble at the exit of the last corner on the last run, but Max improved his time so fair play. It’s his pole position," </i>the 32-year-old told Paul di Resta on the grid.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m happy with the front row, now we’ll see what we can do tomorrow. The car has been good, it got better through qualifying, so hopefully we can keep that momentum for the race."</i>
      </p>
      <p>With the battle for third place still very much on, Vettel could get himself closer to teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> on Sunday with a win, as the Monegasque will start from 14th due to a grid penalty. How does Vettel fancy his chances to get a win in Brazil?</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It will be difficult. Both Red Bull and Mercedes look a bit stronger managing tyres, but we are there for a reason. We’ve got the speed, we’ve got the power, so let’s see what the race brings. I’m carefully optimistic.”</i>
