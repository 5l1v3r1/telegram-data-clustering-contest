      <h1>Former welterweight champ Tyron Woodley thinks YouTube star Logan Paul will sign with UFC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>After Logan Paul’s narrow defeat to YouTube rival KSI in the boxing ring last weekend, KSI suggested the 24-year-old take on CM Punk in MMA.</p>
      <p>Paul, who would have gone on to beat KSI had he not been deducted two points for landing an illegal strike, initially wanted an immediate rematch with KSI but the YouTube giant is warming up to the idea of a fight with Punk, telling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9H_WK1tiws">TMZ Sports</a> that he would ‘destroy’ the former WWE superstar.</p>
      <p>Paul signing with the UFC is certainly plausible, as the American is a former NCAA Division I wrestler and, judging by his two fights with KSI, is a much more technical boxer than CM Punk.</p>
      <p>Former UFC welterweight champ Tyron Woodley thinks it’s only a matter of time until the UFC reaches out to Paul and offers him a contract.</p>
      <p>“(Paul vs. CM Punk) can happen, for sure. To be honest, when the UFC brought over CM Punk, I don’t know why they wouldn’t bring over Logan Paul,” Woodley said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUv1K6D5ehk">TMZ’s The Hollywood Beatdown</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/tyron-woodley-believes-the-ufc-will-sign-logan-paul/">BJPenn.com</a>).</p>
      <p>“Logan Paul is the exact same demographic, 18 to 30 years old. The exact YouTubers that are watching his stuff are the same ones that are watching the UFC. He has a huge following. Great deal. He looks athletic, he’s a Division I wrestler, he’s insane, and he’s going to talk a lot of sh*t so the press conferences are going to be insane. After this last event, I wouldn’t be surprised in the next two months we see some breaking news of Logan Paul getting a couple-fight deal with the UFC.”</p>
      <p>Paul might be interested in trying his hand at MMA, but UFC president Dana White shot down the idea in 2018, telling reporters that Paul would <a href="https://www.sportsjoe.ie/mma/dana-white-logan-paul-178117">get ‘murdered’ in the UFC</a>.</p>
      <p>“That guy would get murdered here. He would get hurt badly. If I ever let him fight in the UFC, I should be arrested.”</p>
