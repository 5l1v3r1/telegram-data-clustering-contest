      <p>#7 QUEEN BEE TO YOU (3-1) drew comfortably and reconnects with Flavien Prat. She projects an outside stalking trip and is a reliable performer for sharp turf/dirt trainer Andrew Lerner.</p>
      <p>#5 Mo See Cal (5-2) is a miler with early-pressing speed, and she finished 2nd in her lone extended sprint try. She reconnects with winning rider Abel Cedillo.</p>
      <p>#3 Starr of Quality (7-2) is a two turn flat mile specialist turning back for +ROI route/sprint trainer Bill Spawr. She is 0-for-5 with four minor awards at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>#1 Show It N Moe It (4-1) might be best used underneath. She might sit an okay inner stalking trip but is 0-for-5 at seven panels. She fired trifecta shots in six of nine local starts (1 win).</p>
