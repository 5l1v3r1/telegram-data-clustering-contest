      <h4>Lisa Rinna came ready to be seen at BravoCon when she arrived in a gorgeous outfit and hairstyle that a fellow Real Housewife called ‘beyond stunning.’</h4>
      <p>The dancing queen has arrived! <b><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/lisa-rinna/">Lisa Rinna</a></b>, 56, showed up to BravoCon in New York City looking sizzling hot in a beautiful knee-length skintight yellow dress on Nov. 16. <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hill</i>s cast member wore matching heels and hoop earrings for the big event that brought out a ton of Bravolebrities for the 3-day spectacular. She also rocked a waist-length twist three days after debuting her <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/13/lisa-rinna-new-hair-makeover-long-blonde-before-and-after-pics/">much longer hairdo</a> (she’s been sporting a shorter look on and off for years) while there. Lisa shared photos from her time at BravoCon on Instagram that left fans and celebs, like former <i>Real Housewives of Orange County</i> star <b>Gretchen Rossi</b>, 40, in awe of her beauty. “You are looking spectacular,” one follower wrote in the comments section.</p>
      <p>The <i>RHOBH</i> ladies came ready to slay, fashion wise, at BravoCon. Lisa posted a video of her costars going out on stage to tape <i>Watch What Happens Live</i> with each looking stunning in their own unique way. OG cast member <b>Kyle Richards</b>, 50, showed off her legs in a glittery blue mini dress while newbie-turned-vet <b>Denise Richards</b>, 48, narrowly avoided a major wardrobe malfunction in a super short and sexy red ensemble.</p>
      <p>Lisa got ready for BravoCon by doing what she does best… dance! The mother-of-two posted several Instagram Stories of her boogying on down in her bedroom prior to making her big entrance. She also reshared a hilarious video from <b>Andy Cohen’</b>s baby shower where she jumped on top of a table and got the crowd all pumped up with her amazing moves.</p>

      <p>Lisa has had quite a month when it comes to her incredible fashion looks. She channeled <b>Jennifer Lopez</b>, 50, in her <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/26/lisa-rinna-jennifer-lopez-plunging-iconic-versace-dress-halloween-photos-pics/">iconic Versace Grammy look</a> at a Halloween party in Los Angeles on Oct. 25.</p>
      <p>The former <i>Melrose Place</i> star also heated things up when she showed up to the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/10/peoples-choice-awards-red-carpet-2019-photos/">People’s Choice Awards</a> in a sleek and sophisticated white look on Nov 10. She later posed during the show with Kyle and another famous reality star… <b>Kim Kardashian</b>, 39.</p>
