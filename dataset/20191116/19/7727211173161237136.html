      <p>A dad-of-four buys hundreds of Christmas presents every year for children as the thought of them going without "breaks his heart".</p>
      <p>Kevin Wilcox, from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/lydiate">Lydiate</a>, raises the funds every November for the presents and goes out with his wife and four children to buy the gifts for different age ranges.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old then donates the hundreds of presents to the Salvation Army for their <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> present appeal, who then in turn deliver the gifts on Christmas day.</p>
      <p>Kevin <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO</a>: "I don't do it for the recognition, but I have been doing it for about seven years now.</p>
      <p>"We have kids ourselves and we know what is like at Christmas and is expensive.</p>
      <p>"We're lucky - we have been pretty comfortable on the financial side and we could never imagine what it would be like for families and it just breaks your heart.</p>

      <p>"It just started off really, I don't even know how it started, I just thought of the kids waking up with nothing and couldn't bear the thought.</p>
      <p>"We go out ourselves and the kids help pick the presents for different age ranges that we have to pick for - the kids love it, it's nice to give."</p>
      <p>The business owner also believes the number of children living in poverty in<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/"> Merseyside </a>is on the rise and the amount of gifts Kevin needs to buy and cash he needs to raise increases each year.</p>
      <p>He added: "Last year the total number was around 180 and some of them are big toys and each year it keeps going up.</p>
      <p>"Each year I am devoted and sometimes I think 'do I have the time to do it', but then I know that people rely on it.</p>
      <p>"You can hear the joy in the kids' voices when you ring up to see how the kids got on - and that's what makes me do it each year."</p>
      <p>Kevin's wife, Claire Wilcox set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/4hpb5h-give-a-child-a-christmas?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unknown&amp;utm_campaign=comms_jjv7+4hpb5h-give-a-child-a-christmas">GoFundMe page</a> to help raise the money needed to buy the presents and sponsor Kevin doing 'Movember'.</p>
