      <p>Accra, Nov. 16, GNA - In order to improve skills of Attendants and various staffs of Hotels and Guest Houses, Ilearn Hospitality Training Centre will commence its first batch of training at its Dzoworlu centre on Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>The Centre, which is affiliated to some hospitality organisations in Europe would begin with 15 students from some renowned hotels in Ghana, Ms Jenny Adade, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre told the Ghana News Agency in an interview in Accra.</p>
      <p>She said the 12-week course would include; two weeks of theoretical and practical work and 10 weeks of internship for students in hotels such as the Movempick Ambassador Hotel, Kempinski Hotel and Royale Fiesta Hotel, all in Accra.</p>
      <p>She said the training would give the students practical hospitality, tourism and entrepreneurship hand-on training skills, secure them internship, present them for interviews in partner hotels and give recognised skills certificates to students on completion.</p>
      <p>She told the Ghana News Agency that although there were a lot of hotels and tourist sites in the country, most of the staff lacked the necessary skills that would attract more patrons and gave the assurance that after training from the centre, they would leverage their knowledge and skills.</p>
      <p>She said; ‚ÄùIt takes a very longtime to get customers, but takes a short time to lose them and that is why training them frequently is very necessary to stay in business.</p>
