        <b>There’s a new Star Wars-themed crossover in Fortnite Chapter 2, celebrating the launch of the new Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order game. The Storm Trooper skin is the main appeal, but everyone’s also wondering about the mysterious Star Destroyer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you buy Fallen Order from the Epic Games store, you’ll get your very own Storm Trooper skin to play as in Fortnite (<a href="https://fortniteintel.com/how-to-get-the-fortnite-imperial-stormtrooper-skin-for-free/27751/">check out our guide here</a>), but that’s not the only new Star Wars related addition.</p>
      <p>When on the battle royale map, look up to the sky and you will notice the distinctive shape of the Star Destroyer menacingly imposing its shadow of the island.</p>

      <p>It’s presumed that in the coming days, the ship may move closer to the map, until it is directly above, and trigger some kind of in-game event, although this is not confirmed.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>However, it’s already possible to go directly the ship and investigate, as YouTuber Ali-A demonstrates in his November 15 video.</p>
      <p>Using the Fortnite Creative mode, Ali-A was able to reach the Star Destroyer in the sky and see if there were any clues to its purpose in the game.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately though, there’s very little to it, as Ali-A simply clips through the ship, with nothing of note in sight.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>That doesn’t rule out the possibility that there is more to come with the Star Destroyer though, but it’s also possible that it’s there for mere decoration.</p>
      <p>So far, Chapter 2 has been pretty devoid of any exciting gameplay additions, or new stuff in general, so hopefully, there is more to come of this Star Wars crossover.</p>
