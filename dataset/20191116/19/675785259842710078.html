      <h1>Doctor's warning after spread of lice which can live in your eyelashes</h1>
      <h2>Similar to head lice, eyelash lice can live in extensions if they are not washed properly and can cause itchiness, redness and inflammation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:06:38+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author">Grace Witherden</a></address>
      <p>If you have eyelash extensions you may want to have a closer look at how well you are cleaning them as doctors have seen an increase in LICE.</p>
      <p>The problem is on the rise because people are not properly washing them over fears the extensions could fall out.</p>
      <p>The lack of cleaning leads to a bacteria build up, which makes the perfect environment for lash lice to live and breed, reports <a href="https://abc7news.com/health/lash-lice-becoming-more-common-in-eyelash-extensions/5699244/?fbclid=IwAR3HF-GG1gyhJPpWLrmVdM0QucAI4Oe-bunmqD6ezh1IuBVbIiDzsfOjGGc">ABC7</a> .</p>
      <p>Lash lice, known by its medical term Demodex, is a type of mite that lives in the oil glands of human hair follicles.</p>
      <p>Symptoms include itchiness, redness and inflammation and lice.</p>
      <p>Eyelash extensions have become a popular treatment offered at salons and by beauticians as they offer a semi-permanent solution for longer, full lashes.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The lashes are applied individually with glue and bonded to your own lashes. The process can take around three hours to apply and last for about six weeks.</p>
      <p>It can cost up to hundreds of pounds for a full set which may be why some people are reluctant to clean them properly.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sairah Malik told <a href="https://abc7news.com/health/lash-lice-becoming-more-common-in-eyelash-extensions/5699244/?fbclid=IwAR3HF-GG1gyhJPpWLrmVdM0QucAI4Oe-bunmqD6ezh1IuBVbIiDzsfOjGGc">ABC7</a> : "Generally the idea when you have eyelash extensions is that people are afraid to kind of touch them or wash them because they're afraid the eyelash will fall out."</p>
      <p>"We recommend tea tree base cleanser. Any cleanser that has a diluted form of tea tree, and it is a good idea to use on a daily basis."</p>
      <p>Tea tree oil is antibacterial and has healing properties.</p>

      <p>Last year Mirror Online reported a Florida-based eye surgeon gave a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/eye-surgeons-warning-grim-hidden-12474922?_ga=2.99993054.1560244336.1573929394-1481935878.1573918519">warning</a> after a woman called Ashley suffered from swollen, irritated eyes after visiting a salon multiple times for lash extensions.</p>
      <p>Ashley visited Dr. Parbhu, who revealed her lashes were infested with Demodex.</p>
      <p>She said: "They burrow to the base of the lash follicles, and they feed off this material. Infection can set in if they overpopulate."</p>
      <p>Customers are also at risk of Demodex if salon staff do not wash their tools properly and if you do not remove your eye make-up properly.</p>
