      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa Reportedly Leaves Mississippi State Game In Ambulance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:37:40+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa left this afternoon’s Alabama-Mississippi State game with an apparent injury. The Crimson Tide’s standout quarterback has now reportedly left the stadium in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>ESPN showed footage of Tagovailoa getting placed into an ambulance late in the third quarter of this afternoon’s game.</p>
      <p>A large Mississippi State banner was placed in front of the ambulance’s doors to give Tagovailoa some privacy.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa is believed to have suffered a hip injury.</p>

      <p>Saban, who is facing some criticism for keeping Tagovailoa in the game for too long, said at halftime that he doesn’t know much about the injury yet.</p>
      <p>“He hurt his hip. I don’t know anything else more than that. That was going to be his last series of half. Certainly I don’t want to see anybody get hurt, especially not him,” Saban said at halftime.</p>
      <p>Saban added that Tagovailoa was only going to play one more series.</p>
      <p>“That was going to be his last series. We were going to put Mac in and we said ‘Let’s put Tua in before the half for 2-minute (drill) just for practice,” he told ESPN.</p>
      <p>Alabama <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/alabama-suffers-another-major-injury-vs-mississippi-state">has suffered a couple of major injuries</a> against Mississippi State so far today. The Crimson Tide should have updates following the contest.</p>
