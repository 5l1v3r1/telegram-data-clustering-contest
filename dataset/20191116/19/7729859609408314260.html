        <b>Clermont produced a sensational home display to beat Harlequins 53-21 in their Pool 3 clash at Stade Marcel-Michelin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quins had no answer for the power of the Clermont pack while the likes of Alivereti Raka and Peceli Yato had a field day with ball in hand.</p>
      <p>Raka opened up the scoring for Clermont while Yato ran in two tries in the first half. Isaia Toeava secured the bonus point fourth try early in the second, with Raka claiming his second while George Moala and Mike Tadjer also went over.</p>
      <p>Morgan Parra added four conversions to his two penalties, with Greig Laidlaw also converting two.</p>
      <p>Harlequins did manage to score three tries through Tom Lawday, Elia Elia and the pick of them from James Lang after a superb Gabriel Ibitoye break. Marcus Smith converted all three, but the Premiership side could not deal with Clermont in this mood.</p>
