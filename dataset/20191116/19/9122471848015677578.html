      <h1>D’Angelo Russell Out At Least 2 Weeks After Suffering Sprained Thumb</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:42:28+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>The hits just keep on coming for the Golden State Warriors. Star guard D’Angelo Russell is the latest to be sidelined. He’ll miss at least two weeks with a thumb injury.</p>
      <p>The Warriors announced the news on Saturday afternoon. Russell injured his right thumb against the Boston Celtics and underwent an MRI after the contest. It confirmed a sprained right thumb.</p>
      <p>Russell will join Steph Curry and Klay Thompson on the injury report. Curry broke his hand a few weeks back, while Thompson tore his ACL in the NBA Finals last season.</p>
      <p>It’s been a tough season for Golden State. The Warriors are 2-11 and can’t seem to stay healthy.</p>

      <p>The silver lining? Golden State could be in position to have the best odds at getting the No. 1 pick in next year’s NBA Draft. If they can get Curry and Thompson back healthy, they should be a title contender next season.</p>
      <p>Russell is the team’s leading scorer this season thus far at 24.3 points per game. He is due to be re-evaluated in two weeks. We’ll keep you updated on his status.</p>
