      <h1>'A propaganda move': Presence of Chinese army in Hong Kong troubles pro-democracy advocates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:08:29+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">Ellie Bufkin</a></address>
      <p>The People's Liberation Army of mainland China made an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mainland-chinese-soldiers-take-to-hong-kong-streets-for-first-time-since-protests-began-11573907250">appearance</a> in Hong Kong over the weekend that troubled some who fear the Communist-controlled military could be used to quell the increasingly violent pro-democracy protests.</p>
      <p>The PLA, which has been garrisoned in Hong Kong since 1997, is infrequently seen outside of their barracks but appeared in the streets in black shorts and green shirts this weekend to clean up debris left by protesters. The soldiers cleared bricks and other items left in the wake of protests that have turned violent over the past few months.</p>
      <p>Protests by those who wish to maintain the "one government, two systems" approach to life in Hong Kong have raged for nearly six months after legislation was introduced that would have allowed residents of Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for prosecution by the Beijing-controlled government. After Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam permanently suspended the bill, protests continued as pro-democracy demonstrators claimed police brutality and squashing of free speech.</p>
      <p>Lam has stated that she will use a firm hand to end the violence and protests after several disturbing incidents have left demonstrators, police, and bystanders with <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/video-man-turned-into-human-torch-during-attack-at-hong-kong-protests">grave injuries</a>.</p>
      <p>The PLA presence in the streets was not meant as a threat to would-be dissenters of the Communist Party of China but was "purely a voluntary community activity," according to a Hong Kong government representative.</p>
      <p>"We initiated this," one PLA soldier said. He also invoked a phrase previously used by Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying, "Stopping violence and ending chaos is our responsibility."</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy advocates have expressed concern, however, that the PLA's unusual appearance was meant as "a propaganda move."</p>
      <p>"I think we could all do without the sight of the PLA on the streets at this sensitive time, even in an unarmed, volunteer capacity," David Webb, an activist and pro-Hong Kong democracy investor, told the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>before referring to China's state-controlled television broadcasts. "No doubt it will be portrayed on mainland TV as the People’s heroes undoing the work of the ‘violent terrorists’ and restoring law and order."</p>
