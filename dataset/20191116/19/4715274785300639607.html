      <h1>Aetas in Pampanga open savings accounts </h1>

      <p>An indigenous community in Porac, Pampanga can now enjoy secure ways of saving their hard-earned money. </p>
      <p>The Aetas who live on farming have recently opened Cebuana Lhuiillier Micro Savings accounts during an Iponaryo cascade.</p>
      <p>“We are happy that an Aeta community is now part of our growing number of Iponaryos who are a step closer to financial inclusion. This complements our #KayaNa: Unbanked Filipinos No More movement which provides unbanked and underbanked Filipinos with access to a savings account,” said Jean Henri Lhuillier, Cebuana Lhuillier president and CEO.</p>
      <p>From as early as June 2019, 8,000 Cebuana Lhuillier employees, dubbed “Iponaryo Ambassadors”, have been conducting cascades nationwide to promote the value of micro savings. In September, over two million Filipinos have already opened a Cebuana Lhuillier Micro Savings account to jumpstart their Iponaryo journey.</p>
