      <p>Scots star Gerry Cinnamon lost the rag mid song at his latest gig as he threatened to batter a mindless thug who threw a bottle towards him while he was on stage.</p>
      <p>The Glaswegian signing sensation was belting out a tune at the 02 Brixton Academy in London when a bottle whizzed past him on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The raging star dropped his guitar and headed towards the crowd in a bid to identify the yob who threw the missile.</p>
      <p>After returning to the stage he then shouted "See this c*** who tried to hit me with a bottle, I will walk off here and rip you limb from limb you f******g idiot.</p>
      <p>"Ya f*****g daftie, I'll punch your c*** in."</p>
      <p>Gerry then started pointing at members of the crowd and asked "Who was it? Was it you?" before calming down, laughing and continuing with his set.</p>
      <p>The Caslemilk singer is in the middle of a tour and will be in Aberdeen next Saturday at the P&amp;J Live Arena before doing two homecoming shows at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro Arena in December.</p>
      <p>He has also just become the first unsigned act to ever sell out Glasgow’s  <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hampden-park">Hampden Park</a> .</p>
      <p>On Friday the 34-year-old folk star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/gerry-cinnamon-becomes-first-unsigned-20889772">sold 50,000 tickets</a> in just four hours for his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/gerry-cinnamon-play-stadium-show-20835415">mega-gig</a> at the National Stadium in July next year.</p>
