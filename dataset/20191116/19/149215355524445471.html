      <p>An anonymous member of the Chinese political establishment leaked over 400 pages of internal documents to <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times</a></i>, which provide an "unprecedented inside view" into Beijing's crackdown on China's Muslim population.</p>

"No matter what age, anyone who has been infected by religious extremism must undergo study."</p>
      <p>A series of internal speeches by Chinese President Xi Jinping also stood out in the document.
