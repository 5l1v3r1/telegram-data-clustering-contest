      <p>Prince Andrew has broken his silence on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-says-let-side-staying-jeffrey-epstein-11165935/">his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who died in jail earlier this year.</p>
      <p>During an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-breaks-silence-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-11149635/">interview with BBC Newsnight</a>, The Duke of York sat with Emily Maitlis to answer questions on his friendship with the former financier for the first time.</p>
      <p>Andrew had been photographed in New York City’s Central Park with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epstein-financier-reportedly-died-suicide-prison-10550126/">Epstein</a> after the businessman had been convicted for the prostitution of minors in 2010.</p>
      <p>Epstein had been sentenced to 18 months for the crime and was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/07/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-charged-sex-trafficking-10127685/">arrested on sex trafficking charges</a> in July of this year. He died in prison awaiting trial.</p>

        <b>What did Prince Andrew say about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prince Andrew, 59, sat for the interview at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In it, he said that his continued friendship with Epstein after his release from prison nine years ago ‘let the side down’ for the royal family.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘I stayed with him … and that’s the bit that … I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.’</p>

      <p>He also claimed that he has ‘no recollection’ of meeting Virginia Giuffre, who said she was forced to have a sexual encounter with him when she was 17.</p>

      <p>Giuffre is one of 16 women who say they were abused by Epstein and has previously alleged in court that she was forced to have sex with the duke.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has strongly denied Giuffre’s allegations, which were dismissed as ‘immaterial and impertinent’ by a US judge.</p>
      <p>The duke said in the interview: ‘I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.’</p>
      <p>Interviewer Emily Maitlis questioned the prince over Giuffre’s claims that ‘she met you in 2001, she says she dined with you, danced with you at Tramp Nightclub in London. She went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia’.</p>
      <p>Maitlis added: ‘You don’t remember meeting her?’, to which the duke replied: ‘No.’</p>
      <p>The full interview, called Prince Andrew And The Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview, will air on BBC Two at 9pm on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking when he was found to have died in his cell of an apparent hanging in August.</p>

      <p>Dr Michael Baden, New York City’s former chief medical examiner, was hired by Epstein’s brother Mark Epstein to examine the autopsy and has insisted that Epstein’s injuries were more <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/billionaire-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-died-murder-not-suicide-medical-examiner-says-11012530/">consistent with homicidal strangulation – not suicide</a>.</p>
      <p>Baden, who has examined more than 20,000 bodies in his time, explained on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/forensic-pathologist-jeffrey-epstein-homicide-suicide">Fox &amp; Friends</a> that Epstein had three fractures in his neck and throat which indicate he could have been strangled.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation. I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case.’</p>
