      <h1>Retailers 'luring' shoppers into Christmas deals with eye-watering interest rates</h1>
      <h2>Critics said customers could be put in debt for months or years to come due to the high amounts of money they will have to pay - retailers charge up to 119 per cent APR</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:50:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Hayward, Dominic Lemanski, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Scrooge retailers have been accused of targeting hard-up shoppers with Christmas deals charging up to 119 per cent APR.</p>
      <p>Stores and online traders have festive loans and store cards with eye-watering interest rates.</p>
      <p>Rent-to-own chain BrightHouse has deals on toys, TVs and electricals with interest rates as high as 69.9 per cent a year.</p>
      <p>So a £384.64 Apple iPad is £561.60 if spread over two years.</p>
      <p>Perfect Home has a PS4 bundle at £399 – but it rises to £810.16 over two years at 119.9 per cent interest. Online fashion retailer Very.co.uk has a “pay later” rate of 39.9 per cent, so a North Face Himalayan windstopper at £439 costs £539.55 over 12 months.</p>
      <p>Littlewoods, whose online ads are fronted by Love Island winner Amber Gill, has a leather biker jacket for £350 but it will cost £440.82 over 12 months at a rate of 44.9 per cent.</p>

      <p>Critics accused retailers of luring shoppers into deals that could put them in debt for months or years to come – while TUC analysis shows the average UK family owes £15,385.</p>
      <p>Damon Gibbons, of the Centre for Responsible Credit thinktank, urged tighter controls and said: “People pay through the nose in the months and years ahead.”</p>
      <p>Sue Anderson, of free advice charity StepChange Debt, said: “High rates risk exacerbating financial stress that people may be experiencing.</p>
      <p>"It’s entirely possible people could find more affordable credit elsewhere, rather than the retailer’s credit.”</p>
      <p>BrightHouse, Littlewoods and Very.co.uk had no comment. Perfect Home did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
