      <h3>Manchester United have been advised to make a move for Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves by former West Ham United star Shaka Hislop.</h3>
      <p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1204137/Man-Utd-news-Ruben-Neves-transfer-Wolves-Manchester-United">Express</a>, Manchester United have been told to sign Portuguese international Ruben Neves from Wolves by former West Ham United goalkeeper Shaka Hislop, who believes the midfielder ticks all the boxes for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have been linked with a host of players ahead of the January window as they look to recover from a difficult start to the season. Although there are other priorities, the midfield department is one where Solskjaer might look to invest in the winter as <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/07/transfer-news-nemanja-matic-prepared-to-leave-manchester-united-in-january/">Nemanja Matic is keen on leaving the club due to the lack of game time coming his way</a>.</p>
      <p>And ex-West Ham stopper Hislop has claimed that Ruben Neves would be an ideal signing for Manchester United. Speaking on ESPN FC (h/t Express), he said: “Well, that [whether Wolves would let Neves go] is the big question. Let’s assume that Manchester United come up with the funds that prompts Wolves to part with Ruben Neves.</p>

      <p>“Just talent-wise, age-wise, ticks all the boxes for Manchester United. Still a big club, still have a lot of money. Assuming they are able to put a package on the table to tempt the player, I don’t think that’s any question, to tempt the club, that is the more difficult proposition, I think they can, I think they will. If they do I think it works perfectly well for both.”</p>
      <p>Neves has been one of Wolves’ best players since joining the club back in the summer of 2017. The Portuguese midfielder played a key role in their promotion to the Premier League and has continued to impress upon arriving in the English top-flight, with his ability from set-piece situations being a particular highlight.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/02/18/transfer-rumour-manchester-united-renew-interest-in-ruben-neves/">The 22-year-old had been linked with Manchester United in the past</a> and could interest them again should a spot open up in the midfield department with Matic’s potential exit. He fits the profile of players Manchester United are looking to recruit under Solskjaer to a large extent and has proven himself at this level.</p>
      <p>Neves is contracted with Wolves till the summer of 2023 and given how pivotal a cog he is in Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, they will not want to lose him should Manchester United rekindle their interest. At the moment though, the Red Devils have more pressing concerns, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/13/transfer-news-manchester-united-told-to-cough-up-10-million-to-land-mario-mandzukic/">with a new striker being on top of Solskjaer’s priority list</a>.</p>
