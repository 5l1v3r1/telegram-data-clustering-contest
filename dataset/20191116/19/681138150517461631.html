      <p>The Blues finished second in their group following victories over Tottenham's Under 21s and Gillingham and a loss to Colchester, who ultimately won the group.</p>
      <p>That meant the Blues would definitely be on the road in the last 32, with Paul Lambert's men now set to play Peterborough.</p>
      <p>The two sides met in the league in August, with captain Luke Chambers rescuing a 2-2 draw for the Blues with a stoppage time equaliser.</p>
      <p>The other sides the Blues could have faced were Exeter, Bristol Rovers and MK Dons.</p>

      <p>The game will be played in the first week of December.</p>
      <p>Lambert has used the competition to give youth and fringe players a chance so far this season, with two 16-year-olds, Liam Gibbs and Tawanda Chirewa given their debuts at Colchester on Tuesday evening along with 19-year-old Brett McGavin.</p>
      <p>The U's reward for winning the group is a home tie with Stevenage.</p>
      <p>Ipswich are now four wins away from playing in a Wembley final in this competition.</p>
