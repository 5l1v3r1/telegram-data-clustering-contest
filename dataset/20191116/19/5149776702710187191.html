      <p>Neal Ardley offered a blunt verdict on Notts County’s defeat against promotion-chasing Barrow and admitted it served as a “reality check”.</p>
      <p>The Magpies were convincingly beaten 3-0 by Ian Evatt’s side who inflicted the first   defeat for Notts at Meadow Lane since August.</p>
      <p>Barrow were 2-0 up after 13 minutes courtesy of slack defending and a mistake and despite showing fine powers of recovery this season, it proved a step too far for on this occasion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts’</a> cause was not helped by being well below par in possession which meant they struggled to fashion clear-cut chances and Magpies boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> had no complaints with the result.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t turn up and the best team won,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They were very good in everything they did and as you are chasing the game, the gulf became bigger and bigger.</p>
      <p>“It’s a reality check for us. We’ve given away really bad goals. They could have been stopped and too many of our players have had an off day.</p>
      <p>“Nine players fell below expectations and that’s down to way the opposition played in that they never let us settle but the way we played as well.</p>
      <p>“We played against one of the top teams and having had nine wins out of 10 coming into this game, that record tells you that they are.”</p>
      <p>Barrow had taken the lead in the 10th minute when Dior Angus slid home following an incisive move, before John Rooney finished at the near post after Enzio Boldewijn had under hit a backpass to goalkeeper Sam Slocombe.</p>

      <p>Notts tried to force their way back into the game, but clear cut chances were rare with Wes Thomas flashing a shot across goal in the second half.</p>
      <p>As Ardley’s side pushed forward, substitue Jack Hindle then punished Notts late in the second half to complete a memorable result for the visitors.</p>
      <p>Notts are still six points off top spot depsite their defeat and Ardley is now eager for his side to issue a response when they head to Aldershot next weekend.</p>
      <p>“Barrow looked like they had more intensity and energy than us, and I haven’t said that much this season,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We defended and attacked poorly, and the players are angry with themselves.</p>
      <p>“The good thing is that when we’ve been beaten in the past, we’ve gone again – that’s what we have to do.</p>
      <p>“It’s the back end of November and we’re just six points off the top. If someone offered you that at the start of the season you’d snap their hand off.</p>
      <p>“We have to take the defeat on the chin, bounce back and make sure we get positive comments next week.”</p>
