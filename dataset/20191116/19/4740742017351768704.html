      <h1>Bristol Bears player ratings - Ioan Lloyd shines yet again as Zebre are dispatched at Ashton Gate</h1>
      <h2>The hosts scored eight tries in the European Challenge Cup opener</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:01:36+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Evans</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Bears are top of European Challenge Cup Pool 4 thanks to their <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/match-reports/bristol-bears-run-eight-tries-3546577">59-21 victory</a> over Zebre Rugby at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Will Capon, Toby Fricker, Piers O’Conor, Ioan Lloyd, Dan Thomas, Yann Thomas, Charlie Powell and Andy Uren were the try-scorers, man-of-the-match Lloyd kicked eight goals from eight and Callum Sheedy chipped in with a conversion.</p>
      <p>We've rated the performances of the home players out of 10...</p>
      <h3>15. Charles Piutau - 8</h3>
      <p>More like the Piutau performance the fans have come to expect. He was confident, hard to tackle, keen to get on the ball and looked very sharp. Taken off after 46 minutes once he'd done his bit.</p>
      <h3>14. Luke Morahan - 7</h3>
      <p>The winger looked dangerous when the ball came his way and made a couple of decent breaks.</p>
      <h3>13. Piers O’Conor - 7</h3>
      <p>Finished his try very well before making way for Charlie Powell at outside centre.</p>

      <h3>12. Siale Piutau (c) - 8</h3>
      <p>Led by example with some bullocking runs. Continued his strong start to the season.</p>
      <h3>11. Toby Fricker - 8</h3>
      <p>Very lively and was in the right place at the right time after Chris Vui and Charles Piutau carved an eye-catching opening down the left-hand touchline.</p>
      <h3>10. Ioan Lloyd - 9</h3>
      <p>Scored a try from 60m out and kicked eight goals out of eight. You can't ask for much more than that from an 18-year-old making his first senior start at fly-half.</p>

      <h3>9. Harry Randall - 7</h3>
      <p>Kept it simple and kept the tempo up in what was an impressive first half from the hosts.</p>
      <h3>1. Yann Thomas - 7</h3>
      <p>Would have felt aggrieved when his try off the back of a driving maul was initially awarded to his fellow front-rower Will Capon. The loosehead got the credit in the end, though.</p>
      <h3>2. Will Capon - 7</h3>
      <p>Scored a try in the first half on his first senior start. Was visibly angry when he dropped a ball in the first half but, once again, didn't look out of place at all.</p>
      <h3>3. Max Lahiff - 7</h3>
      <p>Some powerful carries at close quarters from the former Bath Rugby man.</p>
      <h3>4. Ed Holmes - 5</h3>
      <p>Was quite quiet before getting sin-binned in the second half.</p>
      <h3>5. Joe Joyce - 6</h3>
      <p>Some decent carries and a penalty or two to his name.</p>
      <h3>6. Chris Vui - 7</h3>
      <p>Showed his ball skills in the wide channels and lineouts.</p>

      <h3>7. Dan Thomas - 7</h3>
      <p>Another decent showing from the busy openside. Showed nifty footwork before scoring his try in heavy traffic.</p>
      <h3>8. Luke Hamilton - 6</h3>
      <p>A solid if unspectacular first start for the club from the number eight.</p>
      <h3>Replacements</h3>
      <p><b>16.</b> Harry Thacker - 6</p>
      <p><b>17. </b>James Lay - 6</p>
      <p><b>18. </b>Lewis Thiede - 6</p>
      <p><b>19.</b> John Hawkins - 7</p>
      <p><b>20. </b>James Dun - 5</p>
      <p><b>21. </b>Andy Uren - 7</p>
      <p><b>22.</b> Callum Sheedy - 6</p>
      <p><b>23. </b>Charlie Powell - 7</p>
