      <h1>PKK recruits 270 terrorists from Germany</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T19:20:17+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">ANADOLU AGENCY</a></address>
      <p>The terrorist People's Protection Units (YPG)/PKK group recruited nearly 270 foreign fighters from Germany who took part in battles and terror attacks in Syria and Iraq, a report by German domestic intelligence agency BfV revealed on Friday.</p>
      <p>In an analysis published in the quarterly newsletter of the BfV, the agency said among the almost 270 YPG/PKK foreign fighters who traveled to the region since 2013, at least 22 were killed in clashes or during Turkey's anti-terror operations.</p>
      <p>Three German citizens, Jakob Riemer, Sarah Handelmann and Michael Panser, who were known to German authorities as "left-wing extremists," were among those killed.</p>
      <p>The PKK has been banned in Germany since 1993, but it remains active, with nearly 14,500 followers among the country's Kurdish immigrant population.</p>
      <p>Ankara has long criticized German authorities for not taking serious measures against the PKK and its Syrian affiliate, the YPG, which continue to use Germany as a platform for their fundraising, recruitment and propaganda activities.</p>
      <p>In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU, has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people, including women, children and infants.</p>
