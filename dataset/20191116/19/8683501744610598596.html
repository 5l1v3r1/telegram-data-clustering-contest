      <p>These days, <i>Joker</i>’s cast and crew have a <i>lot</i> to celebrate. The controversial film has steamrolled more than one <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484350/holy-cash-cow-batman-joker-is-now-the-most-profitable-comic-book-movie-of-all-time">box office record</a>. And as of this weekend, it has reached another rare feat: the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484942/joker-is-officially-crossing-the-1-billion-mark">$1 billion</a> threshold. <i>Joker</i>’s director Todd Phillips has already acknowledged the achievement -- and he found a unique way to thank the people who played a pivotal role in the movie’s success.</p>
      <p>It’s not uncommon to see praise from film critics superimposed over scenes and images from a movie in commercials. It sends a strong message: this a movie is worth seeing. Todd Phillips took that theme and turned it on its head when he posted a clip to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B47tg0ephFq/">Instagram account</a> on November 15. At first glance, it appears to be a typical ad hyping up <i>Joker</i>. As clips from the film flash by, quotes like “Beautifully brutal,” “Magnificent,” and “Not a stupid superhero film” fill up the screen. But a closer look reveals that the comments aren’t attributed to critics, but to fans via their Twitter handles.</p>
      <p>The clip ends by announcing that the film has made $1 billion at the box office, and then displaying a final message: “Thank you fans.” Todd Phillips expanded on his gratitude in the accompanying caption. He wrote, “Wow. What a ride this has been!! Thank you to the fans!” Fans commenting on the post shared his exuberant attitude. They thanked him right back, congratulated him, and some started asking for a sequel.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time the director has paid homage to the people he considers vital to <i>Joker</i>’s success. After <i>Joker</i> became the most successful R-rated movie of all time, he <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483229/how-todd-phillips-celebrated-joker-becoming-the-biggest-r-rated-movie-ever">shared a heartfelt message</a> with the film’s fanbase, thanking them for supporting it amid the controversy it’s faced.</p>
      <p>And Todd Phillips’ fan-focused celebration shouldn’t be a surprise if you’ve watched the drama surrounding <i>Joker</i> unfold. After a strong premiere at the Venice Film Festival, it became embroiled in controversy after <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481020/regal-cinemas-responds-to-joker-safety-concerns">concerns arose</a> regarding its violent content. The overall reception to <i>Joker</i> has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482154/oscars-2020-voters-share-blunt-thoughts-about-joker">been mixed</a>, and in the weeks since its release, it’s become the topic of myriad “love it or <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481696/the-biggest-joker-criticisms-from-those-who-dont-like-the-movie">hate it</a>” conversations. Todd Phillips has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481215/keanu-reeves-fans-dont-appreciate-joker-directors-comparisons-to-john-wick">staunchly defended <i>Joker</i></a> against its detractors, and refused to entertain any criticism.</p>
      <p>It’s clear that his latest post is as much about the people he <i>doesn’t</i> feel are responsible for the film’s ongoing success. By using fans’ comments in place of critics, he’s offering a not-so-subtle dig at naysayers by cutting them completely out of the conversation. It remains to be seen how high <i>Joker</i>’s fans will propel the film. But it’s clear that Todd Phillips will be there to virtually high five them the next time <i>Joker</i> hits a major milestone.</p>
