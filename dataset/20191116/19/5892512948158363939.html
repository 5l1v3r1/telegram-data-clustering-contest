      <p>The biggest rematch in bare knuckle boxing history will unfold later tonight (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at Bare Knuckle FC 9 live on <a href="https://www.bareknuckle.tv/orderppv">FITE.TV PPV</a> from Biloxi, Mississippi, as former UFC fighters Artem Lobov and Jason Knight run it back in a highly-anticipated main event.</p>
      <p>Lobov, who is coming off a decision win over former professional boxing champion Paulie Malignaggi back at BKFC 6, defeated Knight in their first meeting this past April. The bout went all five rounds and produced one of the most bloody outcomes in recent combat history, as both fighters walked away with severe cuts to the face.</p>
      <p>While Lobov vs. Knight 2 will lead the way for BKFC 9, the PPV card will also feature the likes of former UFC fighters Chase Sherman and Johnny Bedford, as well as 73-fight MMA veteran Charles “Krazy Horse” Bennett. Not to mention the return of Kaleb Harris, who scored a <a href="https://twitter.com/bareknucklefc/status/1160369758107312128">sensational one-punch knockout finish</a> in his last BKFC outing.</p>
