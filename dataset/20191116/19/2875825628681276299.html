      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Hollywood icon was offered the A-class drug at a party at the home of a big-shot agent where it was 'passed around as dessert' and the hosts 'wanted to see how Mary Poppins would react'</h2>

      <p>A film mogul wanted flying ­nanny Mary Poppins to be high as kite by offering her a “spoonful of sugar”.</p>
      <p>But Julie Andrews, who played the very proper, magical governess, was not about to take this medicine, whether or not it would go down – or up – in a most ­delightful way.</p>
      <p>Dame Julie, who was also clean-cut Maria in The Sound of Music, politely turned her nose up when pressured to snort cocaine at a party.</p>
      <p>Instead she and husband filmmaker husband Blake Edwards told their Hollywood host they were “high on life”.</p>
      <p>Julie, now 84, said she was offered the drug at the unidentified Mr Big’s party.</p>

      <p>She said: “We were invited to a party at the home of a very powerful Hollywood agent.</p>
      <p>"I can’t remember why we chose to attend; we were so seldom partygoers.</p>
      <p>"When we arrived at the house, we were confronted by a classic ‘scene’ for those days, but one that I had yet to witness.</p>

      <p>“A group of guests were doing lines of coke in the living room.</p>
      <p>“During dinner, the coke was passed around as dessert. When it was offered to Blake and me, we both declined.</p>
      <p>“The hosts began pushing me hard, curious to see how Mary Poppins would react. The peer pressure was intense.</p>

      <p>"Blake came to my aid. ‘She doesn’t need any of that stuff,’ he said. ‘She’s high enough on life as it is.’</p>
      <p>“Mercifully, they backed down. When we left, there were bodies on the floor, leaning against the wall, totally wasted.”</p>
      <h3>Surreal</h3>
      <p>Julie won a best actress Oscar for 1964’s Mary Poppins, which was her big screen debut, and a Golden Globe for Sound of Music the following year.</p>

      <p>Julie, who recounts the 1971 anecdote in her new memoir, admitted she found it difficult to make sense of her friends’ drug-fuelled antics.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “Back at home, I stood at my open kitchen window and looked out across the golf course, trying to make some sense of the surreal experience.</p>
      <p>“Suddenly all the sprinklers came on. As they arced over the greens in the starry night, I felt the coolness of the air and smelled the ­water on the earth.</p>
      <p>“It brought me back to reality and ­restored my equilibrium.”</p>
