      <h1>Five charged in high school football game shooting described as "petty vengeance"</h1>

      <p>Five people have been charged in connection with a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pleasantville-nj-shots-fired-at-new-jersey-high-school-football-game/">Friday night shooting</a> at a high school football game in New Jersey, prosecutors said Saturday. Three people, including a 10-year-old child, were shot after a gunman opened fire at the game, in what authorities described as an act of "petty vengeance."</p>
      <p>"This incident had nothing to do with the students of Pleasantville High School or Camden High School," Atlantic County Prosecutor Damon G. Tyner said in a <a href="https://www.acpo.org/5-men-apprehended-charged-in-connection-to-shooting-at-pleasantville-football-game/">press release</a>. "The venue simply presented an opportunity for criminals to pursue their own form of petty vengeance against one another."</p>

      <p>"As a result, an innocent child was caught and injured in their crossfire," Tyner added. "Our community will not be held hostage by a few idiots intent on jeopardizing our safety and the safety of our children."</p>
      <p>The 10-year-old remains in critical condition, the release said. A 27-year-old in stable condition will need surgery, and a 15-year-old who suffered a graze wound was treated at a local hospital and released.</p>
      <p>Alvin Wyatt, 31, has been charged with three counts of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a weapon and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.</p>
      <p>Four other men at the game — Michael Mack, 27, Tyrell Dorn, 28, Shahid Dixon, 27, and Vance Golden, 26 — were also charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and certain persons not to possess a weapon.</p>
      <p>The men fled into Atlantic City after the shooting, prosecutors said in the release. One of the passengers in the getaway vehicle allegedly threw a gun out of the car while entering Atlantic City.</p>
