      <p>Mason Rudolph won't press charges against Myles Garrett over the violent incident which marred the NFL clash between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive end Garrett has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL after ripping Rudolph's helmet off his head and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/myles-garrett-hits-opposition-player-20885862">hitting the Steelers quarterback with it</a> during a melee eight second from the end of the game.</p>
      <p>But Rudolph views the incident as "exclusively an NFL matter" an will not be taking legal action, according to reports from the USA.</p>
      <p>Garrett will miss at least the rest of the season due to the ban, and must apply to NFL officials before he can be reinstated.</p>
      <p>But he only way Garrett would face criminal charges is if Rudolph filed a police report, according to Cleveland police. As of Friday afternoon, the quarterback had not done so, Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/mason-rudolph-wont-press-charges-on-myles-garrett/">New York Post</a> .</p>

      <p>The Post quotes NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, who tweeted: " <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Steelers?src=hashtag_click">#Steelers</a> QB Mason Rudolph won’t take legal action against <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Browns?src=hashtag_click">#Browns</a> DE Myles Garrett after last night’s melee, source said. Rudolph considers the situation to be exclusively an NFL matter."</p>
      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/nfl-star-myles-garrett-admits-20888862">admitted he "lost his cool"</a> after starting the brawl which marred their 21-7 victory over AFC North rivals Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Cleveland's scrappy win at the FirstEnergy Stadium was overshadowed by an ugly skirmish between Garrett and Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph with eight seconds remaining in the match.</p>
      <p>Garrett and Rudolph wrestled on the ground well after the quarterback had passed to Trey Edmunds for an 11-yard gain.</p>
      <p>The Cleveland player then ripped off Rudolph's helmet and swung it at the Pittsburgh man, making contact with his head.</p>
      <p>The Steelers' offensive linemen David DeCastro and Maurkice Pouncey then tackled Garrett to the ground, with Pouncey punching and kicking the defensive end in the head before the Browns' defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi ran in and pushed Rudolph to the floor.</p>
      <p>Garrett, Pouncey and Ogunjobi were all ejected from the game.</p>
      <p>Garrett will not be paid during his indefinite suspension, while Pouncey and Ogunjobi have received shorter bans.</p>
      <p>Pouncey has been banned for three games, while Larry Ogunjobi has been banned for one match for pushing over an opponent in the aftermath of the incident.</p>
      <p>Both the Browns and the Steelers have been fined $250,000 (£194,000),</p>
