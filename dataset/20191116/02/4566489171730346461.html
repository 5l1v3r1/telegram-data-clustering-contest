      <h1>Gunman in US school shooting dies as police hunt motive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T02:10:17+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 02:10</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew MARSZAL (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>The teenager who gunned down classmates at a California high school before shooting himself died Friday, leaving detectives baffled over the motive of a Boy Scout with no obvious alarm bells in his background.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Berhow died in a hospital one day after shooting himself in the head at the end of a 16th birthday rampage that left two fellow students dead.</p>
      <p>Berhow had been in critical condition since police officers storming the campus found him lying among the wounded.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles sheriff's department confirmed Berhow died shortly after 3:30 pm (2330 GMT) on Friday.</p>
      <p>The puzzle of what led him to open fire at Saugus High School, a short commute from Los Angeles, deepened as a picture emerged of a quiet yet sociable teen who was familiar with guns but had no history of troubled behavior.</p>
      <p>"We know it was a planned attack, it was deliberate... The motive? We don't have it yet," Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told a news conference.</p>
      <p>The victims -- a boy and a girl died while another three students were wounded -- appeared to have been chosen at random, he said.</p>
      <p>"There's no relationships that we can tell (between) the suspect and the victims," Villanueva added, scotching rumors that an ex-girlfriend had been his target.</p>
      <p>There was also no history of the teen being bullied.</p>
      <p>The FBI earlier said there is no evidence that the suspect had any ideological motives or acted on behalf of any organization. No manifesto or suicide note has been found.</p>
      <p>Deepening the riddle, Berhow's late father had owned six registered guns -- but none of them matched the .45 caliber semiautomatic the suspect used.</p>

      <p>His proficiency with the weapon during his short, deadly ambush suggested he had been firing guns for some time.</p>
      <p>"In 16 seconds he cleared a malfunction and was able to shoot five people and himself, so he seemed very familiar with firing the weapon," said Villanueva.</p>
      <p>- 'Bewildered' -</p>
      <p>Jared Axen, 33, a next door neighbor, described Berhow as an introvert who was usually quiet and reserved but who had friends and could readily be engaged in conversation.</p>
      <p>"I would see him go back and forth between scouting. I'd see him do a lot of sports-related activities," he told the Los Angeles Times.</p>

      <p>School records show Berhow was a keen middle-distance track runner.</p>
      <p>Aidan Soto, a fellow scout and student at Saugus, described the suspect as a "good kid," and the last person he would expect to carry out a mass shooting.</p>
      <p>"The younger scouts really looked up to him. He was there when they needed him with anything. I'm bewildered and looking for answers."</p>
      <p>Although Berhow had no evident history of violence, his family life over the past few years had been difficult.</p>
      <p>His father, divorced from his mother not long before, died of a heart attack in December 2017.</p>
      <p>The father had reportedly suffered from alcohol-related problems, and was at one point suspected of domestic violence but never prosecuted for lack of evidence.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the father and son were seemingly close.</p>
      <p>"He would tell me that he missed his father and that he loved him," Axen said.</p>
      <p>- 'Another innocent person' -</p>

      <p>The father was a keen hunter whom neighbors would see manufacturing ammunition in his garage. Investigators said they found additional arms at the home, beyond the six registered weapons.</p>
      <p>Berhow would sometimes accompany his father on hunting trips, according to Axen -- accounting for the deadly accuracy of his shooting.</p>
      <p>He also "knew how many rounds he had," noted Villanueva, the sheriff. The teen gunman saved his final bullet for himself.</p>
      <p>The students slain by Berhow were identified as Gracie Anne Muehlberger, 15, and a 14-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>Messages on Muehlberger's Instagram page read "I miss you so much already love," and "It's so sad that another innocent person has to die."</p>
      <p>Another wounded teenager was able to return home Friday morning, and two girls -- both operated on for gunshot wounds -- should be able to leave the hospital in a few days, say medics.</p>
      <p>Tearful prayer vigils were held Thursday night, and all schools in the district remained closed Friday in a mark of respect, Deputy Superintendent Mike Kuhlman said.</p>
