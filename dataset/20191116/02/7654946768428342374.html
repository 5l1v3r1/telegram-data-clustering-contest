      <h1>Michael Bloomberg’s gal pal re-registered as Democrat last year</h1>

      <p>Mike Bloomberg’s longtime girlfriend, Diana Taylor, re-registered as a Democrat last year as he first considered a 2020 White House bid, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>Taylor, a longtime Republican who toyed with a 2010 Senate run on the GOP line, filed the paperwork with the Board of Elections in October 2018.</p>
      <p>That’s roughly the same time the billionaire media mogul and former mayor changed his registration from independent to Democrat as he first explored a possible challenge to President Trump.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg has yet to launch his campaign, but that didn’t stop one longtime admirer from <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/former-miami-beach-mayor-philip-levine-endorses-bloomberg-for-president/">announcing an endorsement</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>“If Mike Bloomberg runs for president, he will command the support of current and former mayors across America. I would be one of them,” said former Miami Beach, Florida, Mayor Philip Levine, who is running for governor as a Democrat in Florida and considers Bloomberg a mentor.</p>
      <p>“As a fellow mayor, Mike was and is considered one of the greatest mayors in history,” he added. “If he throws his hat in the ring, I believe he would present the president with the most formidable challenge in the field.”</p>
