      <p><b>Glasgow Rangers</b> Midfielder, Joe Aribo, is excited after making his first home appearance for Nigeria in Super Eagles 2-1 win over Benin in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Godswill Akpabio international stadium in Uyo on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Aribo has previously featured twice for the national team in international friendly draws against the Ukrainian and Brazilian national teams, scoring in both encounters.</p>
      <p>And the former Charlton Athletic player, who made his first competitive start for the team in Uyo is thrilled by the home support from the home crowd, while also revealing that it is an honour wearing the country’s jersey.</p>
      <p>“Good win in our first AFCON 2021 qualifying game! Always an honour putting on the shirt. Thanks for your amazing support,” Aribo tweeted.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old will be hoping to help Nigeria get the maximum points when they face the Crocodiles of Lesotho on Sunday in their second Group L match.</p>
