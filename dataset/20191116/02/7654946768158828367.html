      <p>President Donald Trump on Friday issued full pardons to two former military officers implicated in improper killings.</p>
      <p>The pardon of former Green Beret Maj. Mathew Golsteyn — who is accused of murdering a suspected bomb-maker while deployed in Afghanistan — circumvents a court martial that had been scheduled for February at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</p>
      <p>Golsteyn has argued that the Afghan was a legal target because of his behavior at the time of the shooting.</p>
      <p>Trump has tweeted in the past that Golsteyn is a “US Military hero” who could face the death penalty “from our own government.”</p>
      <p>Trump also issued a full pardon for Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who’d been found guilty of second-degree murder after nine members of his platoon testified he ordered soldiers to open fire on three men, also in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>In the same statement issued by the White House Friday, Trump ordered a promotion for Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Edward R. Gallagher.</p>
      <p>Gallagher had been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/03/navy-seal-eddie-gallagher-loses-rank-after-being-cleared-of-murder/">bumped down to a lower pay grade</a> after he was convicted in July of posing for a photograph with the corpse of an ISIS fighter while on deployment in Iraq in 2017 — but cleared of murder charges stemming from the fighter’s fatal stabbing.</p>
