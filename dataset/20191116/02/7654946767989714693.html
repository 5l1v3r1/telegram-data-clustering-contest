      <h1>Jury convicts man who took part in $38M Medicare and Medicaid scam</h1>

      <p>A federal jury has handed up a guilty verdict for the man who prosecutors called the “architect” of a massive health care fraud that bilked $38 million from Medicare and Medicaid through false insurance claims.</p>
      <p>Aleksandr Pikus, 44, who managed medical clinics in Brooklyn and Queens, was convicted on Friday of money laundering, conspiring to rip off the federal government and conspiring to receive health care kickbacks.</p>
      <p>Between 2008 and 2016, Pikus and his ring of four admitted scammers billed $86 million to the government through phony companies claiming to provide consulting and marketing services. The scheme generated $38 million in reimbursements.</p>
      <p>Pikus was the only one who tried to beat his charges at trial — co-defendants Malvina Yablonskaya, Maksim Vernik, Denis Satyr and Mark Tsyvin all copped to guilty pleas prior to Pikus’s trial.</p>
      <p>According to a news release from the US Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn, the defendants ran clinics staffed with medical professionals who were enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
      <p>The alleged fraudsters referred patients to those clinics and collected illegal kickbacks from the referrals, court papers state. They also paid bribes to ambulette drivers to steer patients to their clinics and gave cash payments to patients to entice them to undergo medically unnecessary services.</p>
      <p>“Pikus’s health care schemes were a toxic brew of kickbacks and money laundering that streamed millions of dollars into the pockets of the defendant and his co-conspirators at the expense of the Medicare and Medicaid programs,” US Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a news release.</p>
      <p>Aaron Rubin, an attorney for Pikus, said he will appeal the conviction but declined to say what issues he would raise on appeal.</p>
      <p>“We are confident it will result in dismissal of the indictment,” Rubin said.</p>
      <p>Pikus is due back for sentencing on April 8 and faces a maximum sentence of 70 years in prison. He had been out on bond prior to the conviction, but Brooklyn federal Judge Ann Donnelly ordered him detained while he awaits sentencing.</p>
