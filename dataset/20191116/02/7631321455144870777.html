      <h1>Vietnamese businesses suffer longest downtime after security breach: study - VnExpress International</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T02:30:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">VnExpress</a></address>
      <p>The regional average is 35 percent and the global average is 25 percent, according to the 2019 Asia Pacific CISO Benchmark Study recently released by U.S. technology company Cisco.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons for the high downtime is a lack of trained cybersecurity personnel, the report, which polled almost 2,000 security professionals in the region, said.</p>
      <p>Forty seven percent of Vietnamese businesses say a <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/data-speaks/vietnam-sees-fastest-rate-of-it-job-creation-in-5-years-3968667.html">shortage of IT personnel</a> prevents them from adopting more advanced security technologies, up 10 percentage points from last year. The global figure is 24 percent.</p>
      <p>"Despite the appetite for security investments, it remains true that finding the right talent is a constant struggle," the report said.</p>
      <p>But it said Vietnam excels at dealing with alerts and remediating them, adding 51 percent of alerts are investigated, higher than the regional average of 44 percent.</p>
      <p>Local businesses manage to deal with 45 percent of threats, compared to 38 percent in the region.</p>
      <p>The financial impacts of security threats have reduced in Vietnam. Only 18 percent of respondents said the most severe breach in the past one year cost them more than $1 million, compared to 77 percent last year.</p>
      <p>Vietnam suffered 3,159 <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-jumps-51-places-in-global-cybersecurity-rankings-3966278.html">cyberattacks</a> in the first six months of this year, a 45.9 percent decrease year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Information and Communications.</p>
      <p>The country has among the best human resources in the world and could become a <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/economy/vietnam-carries-potential-to-be-a-cybersecurity-powerhouse-minister-3910754.html">cybersecurity powerhouse</a>, Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said in April.</p>
