      <p>The leadership of National  Association of Nigerian Students has advised against resort to self-help in the rift between Total  Nigeria Plc and  Automatic Fits and Energy Limited.</p>
      <p>The Chairman of the committee on Misappropriation, Comrade  Umar Faruk Lawal, in a statement said:</p>
      <p>“I am writing on behalf of the NANS to express our concern over the lingering conflicts between Total and Automatic Fits and Energy Limited.</p>
      <p>”We are unhappy with  the disruption of Automatic Fits and Energy Limited’s business activities by Total Nigeria Plc in connivance with men of the Nigeria Police Force on September, 17 2019 across its Lube Bays in Lagos State and the FCT.</p>

      <p>“As a Body, we have reviewed this ugly incidence and we are totally amazed at the uncivilized and crude manner in which Total through the Nigeria Police carried out this act in total disregard for the laws of the land.</p>
      <p>We would advise that Total Nigeria Plc abides  by the rule of law and obey court orders and not resorting to self help. NANS says  no disobedience of rules of law in Nigeria by Total.  Total should stop exploiting indigenous company. Enough is enough.  Total package should learn to obey court orders, what you cannot do in France, don’t do it in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“We are monitoring development on this issue and we will take the right actions if the Management and Leadership of Total fail to do what is right in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Contacted,  the  Retail Marketing Manager  of Total Nigeria, Henrietta Isokpan, said: “ I am not in the country. They can get to Total. Don’t worry about them. I am not in the country please.”</p>
