      <p>CHICAGO — The Nets may have escaped serious trouble with Kyrie Irving’s shoulder injury, but they’re still in danger of having him shouldering too much of the burden — and of becoming the team that can’t hold a lead or close a game.</p>
      <p>After wasting a 15-point third-quarter cushion in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/second-half-swoon-extends-nets-misery/">Tuesday’s loss at Utah</a>, they flushed a 16-point lead Thursday and lost at Denver. What could have easily been a 3-1 road trip is now 1-3 heading into Saturday’s finale at the Bulls.</p>
      <p>“When you come out at halftime and you’re up 15 in Utah and you’re up 12 [in Denver], that’s a telltale sign we still have growth in different areas,” Irving said. “When teams make their runs, you’ve got to be able to respond, settle down, go into our offensive package and run the plays that work, continue to do the things that got us the lead.</p>
      <p>“It’s just another level that you’ve got to take it to coming out of halftime. The last two games we failed to do so. It starts with all of us communicating, being there for each other and understanding there’s a trend that can start to happen if you don’t fix it now where you come out at halftime and teams jump on you.”</p>
      <p>Fix it Saturday in Chicago and they’ll have the 2-3 road trip many expected. Lose, and the Nets (4-7) will have a four-game skid.</p>

      <p>“Nine games have been close, and we’ve only won four,” Spencer Dinwiddie said. “We’re below .500 in close games. We’ve got to do a better job finishing.”</p>
      <p>Irving is one of the NBA’s best closers, but he is dealing with a shoulder impingement that likely will compromise his game.</p>
      <p>“Listen, Kyrie, every time he competes his tail off,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “I have no qualms, [he] really played hard. The shots, normally he gets up 10 or 12 [3-pointers] a game, so I think he was trying to take it to the basket a little more [Thursday].”</p>
      <p>Irving, who is listed as questionable for Saturday’s game, is 3-of-17 from deep in his past two games, including a season-low 1-for-5 against the Nuggets. But he wouldn’t use the injury as an alibi or say it’s affected his shot.</p>
      <p>“I signed up for this when I was a kid. It’s OK. It’s a long road trip, so I try and do the best I can trying to manage it. But it’s the NBA: There’s no excuses when you actually activate and get out there and play,” said Irving, who declined to say what kind of treatments he’ll have to use to manage the shoulder.</p>
      <p>“Just do the best you can. It’s an 82-game season, so do as much strengthening as you can. There’s not a lot of time on a 10-day road trip when you play every other night. But it’s no excuses: I signed up for this when I was a kid. Just do the best you can.”</p>
      <p>With Caris LeVert <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/nets-caris-levert-out-indefinitely-after-undergoing-thumb-surgery/">already out an estimated 4-to-6 weeks</a>, the Nets will need Dinwiddie to step up, and likely to play alongside Irving more.</p>
      <p>“Just developing the chemistry where I can be off the ball and he can be on the ball, just being mature about it when our execution is much more needed down the stretch,” Irving said. “We’ve just got to find that balance.”</p>
      <p>While Dinwiddie struggled to find that balance last season with D’Angelo Russell, the Nets’ 118.9 offensive rating with him and Irving on the floor is the best of any Nets two-man unit that has logged 100 minutes. It’s also top 20 in the NBA, and Dinwiddie said their friendship helps.</p>
      <p>“That’s my guy. I envisioned playing with him, so it’s not necessarily a curveball,” Dinwiddie said. “It always helps. We have to build on-court chemistry. That goes without saying. But having a preexisting relationship helps in any situation when you’re trying to do a job collectively.”</p>
