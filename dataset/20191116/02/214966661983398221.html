      <p>An urgent recall has been issued for a number of cheeses over fears they could be contaminated with E. coli bacteria.</p>
      <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alerted people to the recall of the 200g Udder Delights White Mould cheeses in a notice on Friday.</p>
      <p>“The recall is due to Potential microbial (E.coli) contamination,” the recall notice reads.</p>
      <p>“Food products contaminated with E.coli may cause illness if consumed.”</p>

      <p>The affected products have been available for sale at Coles and independent retail stores in QLD, VIC, WA and SA, Coles, Woolworths and independent retail stores in NSW, and independent retail stores in SA and TAS.</p>
      <p>We’re being urged to chuck out any of the cheeses with best before dates between the 29th of January and 5th of February 20-20.</p>
      <p>“Any consumers concerned about their health should seek medical advice and should return the products to the place of purchase for a full refund,” the ACCC said.</p>
