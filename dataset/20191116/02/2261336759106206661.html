      <h1>Israel Adesanya has no interest in boxing crossover fights, plans to make mega-money in UFC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T02:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Everyone from <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/4/20947950/ufc-244-mma-news-interview-boxing-jorge-masvidal-canelo-alvarez-fight-new-york-nate-diaz">Jorge Masvidal</a> to <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20959259/ufc-mma-boxing-news-social-media-heavyweight-stipe-miocic-tyson-fury-darren-till-fight">Stipe Miocic</a> wants to make the crossover to boxing, but newly-crowned UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya has no intention of ever leaving the cage.</p>
      <p>Speaking on a recent edition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnIG6xLorrk"><i>Ebro in the Morning</i></a>, ‘The Last Stylebender’ said he plans to make mega-money in the UFC and can’t understand why other fighters won’t adopt the same attitude.</p>
      <p>“This [UFC] is where I’m going to end my career,” Adesanya said (<a href="https://thebodylockmma.com/ufc/israel-adesanya-not-interested-in-boxing-hopes-to-get-first-nine-figure-payday-in-the-ufc/">h/t Abhinav Kini of The Body Lock MMA</a>). “People say, ‘oh, after UFC, you can go to boxing and have one super fight maybe with Canelo and make a hundred million.’</p>
      <p>“I’m like, I can do that in the UFC. I might be the first fighter to do that in the UFC.”</p>
      <p>Adesanya, a former kickboxing world champion, went on to state that the ‘baddest motherf-ckers’ in the world belong in the UFC, not boxing or any other limited combat sport.</p>
      <p>“It’s silly. Why would I come to the proving ground of all fighting — the UFC — and then afterward, fight a guy and take away like 80 percent of my weapons,” he said. “… I want to kick people. I want to strangle someone. I can’t do that in boxing. I don’t want to get into the clinch and then okay, break.</p>
      <p>“Same thing with kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, judo, wrestling — they’re all limited styles of fighting. If you want to be the baddest motherfucker in the world. Pound-for-pound…everyone throws that greatest fighter, pound-for-pound is Canelo [Alvarez]. He’s the pound-for-pound maybe greatest boxer right now. Not fighter. You have to test yourself against another style.”</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old unified the middleweight titles with a second-round knockout of Robert Whittaker at UFC 243 and plans to defend his title against Yoel Romero in the new year.</p>
