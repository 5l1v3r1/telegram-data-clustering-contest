      <p><b>NATICK</b> - For the past two years the Mansfield Hornets High School football team fell just one game short of getting to Gillette Stadium and playing for a state championship.  On friday night in Natick, the Hornets finally break through and earn that trip to Gillette.</p>
      <p>Led by a stingy defense and some great offensive performances, Mansfield beats previously undefeated (9-0) Natick 22-3 to advance to the Division 2 Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>Mansfield senior captain Vinnie Holmes rushes for 130 yds. Senior captain Nick Marciano rushes for 40 yds and a second half TD to lead the Hornets offense.</p>
      <p>On December 6th at Gillette Stadium, Mansfield will be looking for their 4th Super Bowl title since 2010 when they face Lincoln Sudbury</p>
