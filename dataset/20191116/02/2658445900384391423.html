      <h3>Our Reporter</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Co-ordinator for the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Network Vision, Hon. Shina Adeosun, has called on Nigerians to give more support to the All Progressive Congress (APC) and its National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who he described as one of the greatest leaders in the contemporary political setting in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He said it was against this background that they decided to establish the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Network Vision aimed at propagating the political values of the great leader as well as embarking on intense mobilization of Nigerians, irrespective of tribe or religion, to identify with his progressive cause.</p>
      <p>The Harvard-trained administrator and Lagos-based APC chieftain, who declared this at a meeting with the Ibrahim Alao Megida-led Mainland Independent Group (MIG), praised the patron of MIG, Hon. Tunji Bello, currently the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, not only for his exemplary records in public service, but his steadfastness in support of the progressive cause of  Asiwaju  Tinubu over the years.</p>
      <p>At the meeting, the BAT Network Vision and MIG agreed to work hand-in-hand in the mobilization vision of the BAT Network Vision. The two groups adopted December 26 as the date to formally launch the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Network Vision. An elaborate prayer session will also be organized for Asiwaju Tinubu and Hon Bello, among others.</p>

      <p>Hon. David Olusesi, the co-ordinator of the BAT Network Vision in the Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area, said APC members who felt they had been denied one thing or the other to be patient as they would surely be rewarded.</p>
      <p>He also indicated his readiness to establish a branch of the MIG in Ifako-Ijiaye  in appreciation of their good work and their patron Hon  Bello.</p>
      <p>Leader of MIG, Alhaji Ibrahim Alao Megida, who welcomed members of the BAT Network Vision, expressed his appreciation to the members of the group for their courtesy visit and the joint working agreement between his group and their own.</p>
      <p>Also present on the occasion were  Hon Dayo Macaulay and Alhaja Mojisola, among others.</p>
