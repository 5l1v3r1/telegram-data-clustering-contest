      <h1>Art Galley of Ballarat showcases 'Locus' exhibition in Backspace gallery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T02:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Hopkins</a></address>
      <p>A group of artists have showcased the importance of collaboration for inspiration with the Art Gallery of Ballarat's new Backspace exhibition, <i>Locus.</i></p>
      <p>Playing host to the work of five local artists, the exhibition is made up of diverse and unique pieces, ranging from reclaimed 'junk' turned into sculptures to vibrant canvas paintings capturing the energy of the tropical Philippines.</p>
      <p>One of the five artists being showcased is Scott Fredericks, who said working with the rest of the group on the exhibition helps inspire him to create something unique.</p>
      <p>"It's really inspiring," he said.</p>
      <p>"We've worked together for around four years and everyone's individual practices and works really inspires each other in what we're doing.</p>
      <p>"This is the best way to work... find your mob and collaborate."</p>
      <p>Those sentiments were echoed by fellow group member Peter Gregg, who says working in a group setting provides him with a lot of confidence.</p>
      <p>"There's a great sense of confidence in working within a larger group like this," he said.</p>
      <p>"You have confidence that they're going to come up with the goods and hopefully they give that same confidence back to you."</p>
