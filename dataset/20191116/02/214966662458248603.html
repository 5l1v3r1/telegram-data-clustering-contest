      <p>A MAN has been charged after allegedly lighting a fire in NSW, in a backburning attempt to protect a cannabis crop.</p>
      <p>The fire, which began on Thursday, is still burning out of control in the state’s Northern Tablelands.</p>
      <p>Police say officers were alerted to the suspicious blaze after receiving reports of a fire threatening the township of Ebor, 80km north-east of Armidale.</p>
      <p>Following investigations, a 51-year-old Ebor man was arrested just after 2pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>He was taken to Armidale Police Station where he was charged with intentionally cause fire and be reckless to its spread.</p>
      <p>“Police will allege in court that the man lit the fire as an attempt to back burn for the protection of a cannabis crop and perceived benefit from recovery work after the fire and made no attempt to control the blaze,” NSW police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>He was refused bail at Armidale Local Court and is due to appear in court again on Monday.</p>
      <p>Investigations continue.</p>
