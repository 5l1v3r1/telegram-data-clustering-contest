      <p><b>Ratatouille movie cast:</b> Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Peter O’Toole, Will Arnett<br/><b>Ratatouille movie director:</b> Brad Bird<br/><b>Ratatouille movie rating:</b> 5 stars</p>
      <p>“I think it is apparent that I need to rethink my life a little bit. I can’t help myself, I like good food,” and so runs my inner monologue every morning these days. And yet, like Ratatouille’s Remy, I cannot seem to stop myself from endlessly gorging on delicious meals. In fact, the aforementioned quote is actually from Disney’s 2007 beloved film Ratatouille. Talk about the relatability factor.</p>
      <p>Remy is a young, sharp rat with a knack for tasting and creating cuisines. His life changes when he chances upon the failing cook Alfredo Linguini in Paris. The legacy of good food, a great chef, the subconscious familial burden of carrying on the glorious past and to join and even excel in the business of the ancestors is a few of the central themes of this Brad Bird directorial. Anyone who adores food and entertaining cinema should be in on this adventure of a lifetime.</p>
      <p>There is a reason why Ratatouille won an Oscar in the Best Animated Feature category. Brad Bird. Bird who produced, wrote and helmed this delightful little tale of ambition and passion deserves most of the credit for the film’s success. Of course, having voice actors like Patton Oswalt and Lou Romano helps the case immensely. But everything would have not come together as smoothly as it had, had it not been for the captain of the ship. The concept of the film is, at its very base, brilliant but simple — a rat, who scurries about in the kitchen in the hopes of garbage as food, nurses the insane dream of becoming a chef? What is not to love? And human beings, who always turn up their noses in disgust at the very mention of the being, end up developing a special bond with one? This was a success to begin with, what it needed was the correct push, which it thankfully got from the big people at Disney. Ratatouille is not for kids, nor is it for adults. It doesn’t come with any label and the best thing about a ‘food movie’ is that ‘There is no such thing as a bad food film.’ (This is, of course, a personal adage).</p>
      <p>Here is some interesting trivia from Ratatouille. It is said that director Brad Bird wanted to cast Patton Oswalt after hearing him perform stand-up on a food routine. And in turn, Oswalt has himself confessed a number of times how movies have taught him everything he knows about life. Sounds like the perfect marriage. Director and artiste meet, and they both get from each other what they want whilst complimenting the other.</p>

      <p>The success of the movie has spawned a theme park ride in Disneyland, Paris, as well as a video game – Ratatouille: Food Frenzy. So Ratatouille not only turned out to be a critical success, but a commercial one as well. But for me, even after 12 years of its release, the movie still stands the test of time because of its extraordinary execution. You know the makers have hit the nail on the head when animated food evokes pangs of hunger.</p>
      <p>Ratatouille is currently streaming on Netflix.</p>
