      <h1>Cash Money Founders Birdman &amp; Slim Explain Importance Of Feeding Community For Thanksgiving</h1>

      <p>The founders of Cash Money Records understand how important New Orleans is to their ongoing success, so they are paying it forward.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Rap moguls Bryan "Birdman" Williams and his brother Ronald "Slim" Williams are heading home to New Orleans to feed the local community for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
      <p>The bosses of Cash Money Records will be in New Orleans on November 26th, to host their annual free turkey giveaway, as well as sides.</p>
      <p>For the 23rd year, the brothers co-host the food drive through their Johnny and Gladys Williams Foundation, which is their non-profit named after their parents.</p>
      <p>“As much as the legacy of Cash Money belongs to us, it also belongs to the city of New Orleans. Our greatest success was being able to go home once a year, be on those same streets we grew up on, and prop up our brothers and sisters in the neighborhood," Bryan "Birdman" Williams explained. "That’s what this label was always about. There’s nothing more important as far as I’m concerned—and never will be anything more important. It comes before anything.”</p>
      <p>Once again, the Williams brothers have partnered with New Home Full Gospel Ministries to host the event, while Walmart provided the turkeys, and Rouses donates the sides and fixings.</p>
      <p>The brothers have also organized a variety of events for local health screening services for local community members, courtesy of Ochsner Health Systems.</p>
      <p>Testing for glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure, dental care, eye exams, quick look EKG’s, stroke assessment, kidney disease, prenatal care, and diabetes screenings will be available.</p>
      <p>“It’s incredible to think we’ve been doing The Turkey Giveaway for 23 years,” added Ronald "Slim" Williams. “I really believe it’s the most important thing we do. New Orleans made us. It’s a part of who we are. So, there’s no better feeling than giving back to our home. Every year, we try to do more, but it’ll never be enough to thank the city for everything it’s given to us and our families.”</p>
      <p>The Cash Money turkey giveaway will take place at New Home Full Gospel Ministries from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on November 26th. </p>
