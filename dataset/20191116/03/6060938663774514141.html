      <p>INDORE: When South Africa lost the Test series to India in 2015, their coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Russell-Domingo">Russell Domingo</a> was confused during the press conference in Nagpur. It was difficult to understand whether he was upset about poor nature of wickets during the series or his batsmen's ability to play spinners.</p>
      <p>Four years later, Domingo, now a Bangladesh coach, has no complaints about the nature of wickets. The cricketing world has seen the rise of Indian team, especially in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Test-cricket">Test cricket</a>. Domingo feels shift in mindset has resulted into India becoming a world class team that can beat anyone in any condition.</p>
      <p>"There's no doubt that in the past that India backed themselves to win at home on spinning pitches. Now, I don't think that's the case. I think they are backing themselves against any team on good pitches in the country. There's definitely a mindset shift," Domingo said after yet another frustrating day for his team.</p>
      <p>Domingo wants Bangladesh to develop fast bowlers, prepare wickets that help fast bowlers, like India has done. "They beat Australia in Australia; competed with South Africa (in South Africa). That's the biggest shift. India no longer rely on spinners. They will prepare good wickets and back their fast bowlers to do the business," he said.</p>
      <p>The Bangladesh coach would have loved to have more time before the first Test, which started just three days after T20 series.</p>
      <p>"We had two days with the Test squad before the first Test. A lot of the focus was with the T20 as it was the format taking place first. There hasn't been a lot of preparation for Test cricket and getting to know some of the players.</p>
      <p>He sympathized with skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mominul-Haque">Mominul Haque</a> who had tough last two days. "It (India) is a tough place to be a captain. But he is a calm and composed guy. I am sure he would have learned a great deal today. It is very hard to judge him on one Test match in India after two tough days. He will grow into the job. He has all the right attributes. He is a good young player. He is eager to learn. I think he commands respect as he is such a calm person," the South African said.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh needed third seamer, especially on this Holkar wicket, which was providing enough for pacers. However, adding an extra batsman to the playing meant Bangladesh had to compromise on their already thin batting line up. Domingo acknowledged they didn't have a quality seamer who can bat a bit. He said Bangladesh need to quickly find out quality pacers to make their presence feel.</p>
      <p>"To win Tests, you need a bowling unit. For Bangladesh to do well in away Tests, you need up to six bowlers. India, Australia, England and South Africa have done well because they can pick a group of five or six fast bowlers under any conditions, home and away," said Domingo.</p>
