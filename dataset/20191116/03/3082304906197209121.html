        <b>Runner-up last year, Danny Lee made a fine start to the Mayakoba Golf Classic in Mexico.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Danny Lee fired a nine-under 62 to grab a first-round lead at the Mayakoba Golf Classic on Friday.</p>
      <p>The PGA Tour event finally got underway in Playa del Carmen after heavy rain led to Thursday’s scheduled play being washed out.</p>
      <p>Lee, last year’s runner-up, pushed into a one-stroke lead after mixing eight birdies with an eagle and a bogey.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander holds a lead over American duo Brendon Todd and Adam Long, who opened with fine eight-under 63s.</p>

      <p>Vaughn Taylor, Mark Hubbard, Zach Johnson and Chris Baker are a shot further back after the opening round.</p>
      <p>Defending champion Matt Kuchar, who held off Lee by a shot last year, carded a two-under 69 to be tied for 44th.</p>
      <p>Due to the rain, the third and fourth rounds will begin on Sunday, while the event will finish on Monday if required.</p>
