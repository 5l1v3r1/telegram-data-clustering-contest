      <blockquote>
        <i>"Hello, This is Rising Star Entertainment.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>We are releasing a statement regarding the spreading of false statements and malicious slander about JuEun of ARIAZ.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Since September, our company has continued to monitor malicious and slanderous posts and malicious comments based on false information that damages JuEun’s image and reputation. A self-investigation of the school JuEun went to showed that there were no records of actions or punishments in relation to ‘school violence.’ Despite that, there have been posts that talk about ‘school violence’ groundlessly and they have caused severe damage. As we cannot overlook that, we filed a criminal complaint through a legal representative using the evidence we collected.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Therefore, we will seek civil and criminal legal action and will not make negotiations or show leniency. We will also respond strictly to any further cases of damage in the future.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Our company will do our best so that the rookie group ARIAZ will no longer be viewed in an unfair way and will approach their fans with a good appearance. In addition, we will always watch over and lead the ARIAZ members so that they can develop as they take the right actions and have mature thoughts.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Once again, we are always thankful for the trust and support of fans who love ARIAZ, and we ask for your unchanging warm support"</i>
