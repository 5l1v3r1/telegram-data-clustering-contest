      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Indianapolis-Colts/?tps=1">Indianapolis Colts</a> starting quarterback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jacoby-Brissett/?tps=1">Jacoby Brissett</a> will be back in the lineup for Sunday's matchup against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jacksonville-Jaguars/?tps=1">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>.</p>
      <p>Brissett sat out of the Colts' Week 10 loss to the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Miami-Dolphins/?tps=1">Miami Dolphins</a> on Sunday because of a sprained MCL in his left knee. The fourth-year quarterback was a full participant in each practice this week and was listed without a designation, according to the team's <a href="https://twitter.com/Colts/status/1195436432590024719">official injury report</a>.</p>
      <p>Brissett initially sustained the injury during the Colts' loss to the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pittsburgh_Steelers/?tps=1">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> on Nov. 3. Pro Bowl guard <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Quenton-Nelson/?tps=1">Quenton Nelson</a> was pushed back into the quarterback and stepped on his leg in the first half.</p>
      <p>Brissett was a limited participant in each practice leading up to the Dolphins game. The Colts, who are on a two-game losing streak, ruled him out the day before the contest.</p>
      <p>"He's looked really good," Reich <a href="https://www.colts.com/video/frank-reich-gives-final-injury-update-before-facing-jaguars">told reporters</a> this week. "I don't want to put a percentage on it. I just know he's good enough to play."</p>
      <p>Brissett has completed 64.8 percent of his passes for 1,649 yards, 14 touchdowns and three interceptions in eight games this season. He has added 37 carries for 110 yards and a rushing score.</p>
      <p>The Colts ruled out wide receiver <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/TY-Hilton/?tps=1">T.Y. Hilton</a>, who will miss his third straight game because of a calf injury. Indianapolis (5-4) is 0-7 without Hilton in the lineup.</p>
