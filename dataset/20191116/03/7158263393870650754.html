      <p>Ever since Jeffrey Epstein's highly publicized sexual trafficking case and suicide, Prince Andrew has been criticized for his friendship with the billionaire. <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28746543/buckingham-palace-statement-prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-sexual-misconduct/">The palace released a few short statements about their relationship</a>, trying to distance the royal from the scandal, but now for the first time, Andrew himself is answering questions about his involvement with Epstein.</p>
      <p>In an interview with BBC, which is set to air in full tonight, Andrew says that he regrets remaining friends with Epstein and staying at his house after Epstein served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution and was registered as a sex offender.</p>
      <p>"The problem was the fact that once he had been convicted I stayed with him and that’s…that’s the bit that…that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis," Andrew says. "It was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices. I let the side down, simple as that."</p>

      <p>Andrew adds, "It was a convenient place to stay...It was definitely the wrong thing to do. But at the time, I felt it was the honorable and right thing to do."</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew also addressed <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28668951/prince-andrew-underage-sex-allegations-jeffrey-epstein/">the accusations of Virginia Giuffre (formerly Roberts)</a>, who claims that she was forced to have sex with him three times, the first time when she was 17.</p>
      <p>The interviewer asks, "One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, has made allegations against you. She says she met you in 2001, she says she dined with you, danced with you at Tramp Nightclub in London. She went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia belonging to Ghislaine Maxwell, your friend. Your response?"</p>
      <p>Andrew denies ever knowing Giuffre, saying, "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."</p>
