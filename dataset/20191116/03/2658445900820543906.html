      <p>Youths of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State have vowed not to abandon Governor Godwin Obaseki in his quest to get the party’s ticket for a second term in office.</p>
      <p>The Edo APC youths said they supported former Governor Adams Oshiomhole to have a peaceful eight years in office and as such they would not allow any group or persons to stop Governor Obaseki.</p>
      <p>They said Governor Obaseki has performed beyond expectations in all sectors of the state economy.</p>
      <p>The state youth leader of the APC, Mr. Valentine Asuen, who spoke to newsmen at a press briefing in Bénin City said youths in the state were solidly behind Governor Obaseki because they have benefitted more from the administration.</p>

      <p>Asuen dismissed the purported letter the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC relied upon to uphold the suspension of the State Chairman of the party, Mr. Anselm Ojezua.</p>
      <p>He urged the APC NWC to disregard the letter saying the signatories were fake as they were obtained under duress.</p>
      <p>According to him, “Governor Obaseki has done well in the education, health sectors, transportation, rule of law and most especially in boosting the revenue profile of the state. We are not going to abandon him.</p>
      <p>“It is only in Edo that councils can now pay salaries without waiting for money from the federation account. The people fighting him are those that have been feeding from the state revenue.</p>
      <p>“We will not allow them to succeed. We are with Obaseki and will mobilise Edo APC youths to ensure Obaseki gets the needed support. Edo can not afford to go back to the days of the locust.”</p>
