      <h1>‘Does not deserve this’: Roger Stone’s daughter begs Trump for pardon to ‘save our family’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:31:20+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Chaitin</a></address>
      <p>The daughter of Roger Stone delivered an urgent plea to President Trump to "save" her family after her father was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dirty-trickster-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-congress-in-wikileaks-case">found guilty</a> on all counts for impeding a House investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Adria Stone appeared on Fox News on Friday, hours after her 67-year-old father was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dirty-trickster-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-congress-in-wikileaks-case">convicted by a federal jury on seven counts</a> that include lying to Congress and witness tampering.</p>
      <p>Host Tucker Carlson said he believes people will be "watching really carefully" for Trump to bestow a pardon on his longtime informal adviser. Adria Stone, 53, responded by making a request directed at the president.</p>
      <p>"Donald Trump — if you can hear me, please save our family. He does not deserve this. Nobody deserves this," she said.</p>

      <p>Stone, well known as a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/smears-swingers-and-dirty-tricks-roger-stones-colorful-career-in-politics">"dirty trickster</a>," faces up to 50 years in prison, a maximum of 20 alone for the most serious charge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/a-double-standard-like-never-seen-before-trump-reacts-to-roger-stone-being-found-guilty">Trump said Friday</a> that Stone was treated unfairly, moments after he was convicted of lying about attempts to reach WikiLeaks and related charges. The president <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/he-is-getting-impeached-anyway-ex-aide-sam-nunberg-says-trump-should-pardon-roger-stone">tweeted</a> the trial was "a double standard like never seen before."</p>
      <p>Adria Stone suggested her father was a victim of dark forces, urging Carlson's audience to "look at the money trail and where this all started."</p>
      <p>"Nobody should have to lose their life to what we have just experienced," she said. The younger Stone added "there's a lot more to come out," but claimed she "can't talk about it" yet.</p>
