      <p>A 51-year-old man has been charged with lighting an out-of-control fire in the New South Wales northern tablelands in order to protect a cannabis crop.</p>
      <p>The fast-moving blaze at Guyra Road in Ebor, north-east of Armidale, was burning across more than 2,000ha on Friday afternoon as it spread towards the Ebor township.</p>
      <p>The fire was reported to emergency services at about 10.30pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested just after 2pm on Friday in Ebor and charged with intentionally causing fire and being reckless in its spread.</p>
      <p>Police will allege in court the man lit the fire as an attempt at a backburn to protect a cannabis crop and made no attempt to control the blaze. They also allege he hoped to benefit from government payments in the recovery after the fire.</p>
      <p>He was refused bail to appear at Armidale local court on Saturday.</p>
