      <p>HMD may be planning some new Nokia smartphone launches in near-future and we have already reported some exclusive details about <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-2-3/">Nokia 2.3</a> and what could be the <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-1-2/">Nokia 1.2</a> Plus or <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-1-3/">Nokia 1.3</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, even more unknown Nokia smartphone variants have appeared in Russian certification. Nokia TA-1205, TA-1212 and TA-1234 may belong to three new smartphones and phones.</p>

      <p>As one can notice in the screenshot above these entries have been added recently to the certification database. So, what are we looking at?</p>
      <p>While the 5G <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-8-2/">Nokia 8.2</a> is slateed to arrive at MWC 2020, <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-5-2/">Nokia 5.2</a> and <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-9-1-pureview/">Nokia 9.1 PureView</a> may be candidates for an early announcement. But not many leaks have emerged of either of the two recently, so we may need to wait a bit before we get the picture.</p>
