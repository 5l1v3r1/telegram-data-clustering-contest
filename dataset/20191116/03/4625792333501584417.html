      <h1>Nancy Pelosi: Trump attacked former ambassador to Ukraine during hearing because he is an 'impostor'</h1>

      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said President Trump’s criticism of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch stems from his "insecurity as an impostor."</p>
      <p>CBS News host Margaret Brennan interviewed Pelosi on Friday to get the speaker’s reaction to the second day of public impeachment hearings in the House. CBS released a clip of the interview on Friday, while the full segment is scheduled to air on Sunday's <i>Face the Nation</i>.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Yovanovitch testified in the Democrats' impeachment investigation into whether Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to secure investigations for political reasons. During Yovanovitch's hearing, Trump criticized the former ambassador's record working for the State Department.</p>
      <p>"He knows her strength, and he was trying to undermine it," Pelosi said, giving her perspective of Trump’s criticism. "He should not frivolously throw out insults, but that’s what he does. I think part of it is his own insecurity as an impostor. I think he knows full well that he's in that office way over his head, and so he has to diminish everyone else."</p>

      <p>Trump tweeted while Yovanovitch was testifying, attacking her record as an ambassador to Somalia and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him," he wrote.</p>

      <p>Yovanovitch then responded to the president's tweet in real time, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-mean-i-i-dont-think-i-have-such-powers-yovanovitch-pushes-back-on-trump-live-tweet-during-testimony">pushing back on his claims</a> during the hearing.</p>
