      <p>If you’re travelling overseas, Yoodo is now offering a promo for roaming which allows you to bring your home data, calls and SMS with you from as low as RM5/day. From 15 November 2019 to 31 January 2020, its Roam Like Home passes is offered at half price.</p>

      <p>The standard “Roam Like Home” add-on which is supported in several countries in Asia such as Singapore, Indonesia, India, Thailand and Brunei is now going for RM5/day instead of the usual RM10/day. The plan is valid for a period of 24 hours from activation. For other international destinations including the United States, Japan, China, Australia and European countries, the Plus pass is now going for RM10/day instead of RM20/day.</p>
      <p>Unlike other telcos, the Roam Like Home passes doesn’t come with bundled data but it allows you to utilise your existing local data overseas. For example, if your plan has 30GB of data, you can access the same quota overseas using the pass.</p>
      <p>At the moment, Yoodo is running a <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/10/yoodo-promo-free-20gb-data/">free 20GB promo</a>, so you can get 30GB of data for only RM35 when you switch your plan. If you need more data during your trip, you can always purchase a data booster.</p>
      <p>The Roam Like Home pass also allows you to make and receive calls to Malaysia but if you plan on calling local numbers at your destination, you are required to purchase an IDD add-on for that specific country.</p>
      <p>You must also ensure that you’re connected to the right telco partner for it to work. They also assured that there’s no bill shock as Yoodo roaming services will not be available until you purchase an eligible pass. You can find the rates and more info on Yoodo’s <a href="https://www.yoodo.com.my/our-products/">roaming page</a>.</p>
