      <p>Katy Perry is all set to perform in Mumbai on November 16 at the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/oneplus/">OnePlus</a> Music Festival. The global music star arrived in Mumbai a few days ago and greeted the media upon her arrival. This isn’t Katy’s first trip to India, in fact, she has spent quite some time here. The pop star last performed in India in 2012 at IPL’s opening ceremony. Her wedding with Russell Brand was held in Rajasthan in 2010.</p>
      <p>As you get ready to attend Katy Perry’s concert at D.Y. Patil Stadium today, here’s a playlist of Katy Perry’s most popular songs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Roar</b>

      <p>“Roar” is probably one of Katy Perry’s most popular songs. Released in 2013, the track is a part of her fourth studio album Prism. The song became a chartbuster soon after its release. It was the most viewed song on YouTube in 2013.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Dark Horse</b>
      </p>

      <p>“Dark Horse” has one of the most fascinating music videos with Katy Perry in ancient Egyptian attire. At the time, the video caused some controversy but the controversial journey of the track lasted for many years, and not because of the video. She was accused of plagiarism by Marcus Gray. The accusation read that “Dark Horse” sounded a lot like the track “Joyful Noise.” Perry lost the lawsuit in early 2019 and was ordered to pay 2.78 million dollars.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Firework</b>
      </p>

      <p>Fans of Masterchef Australia are yet to understand why the track has been the opening theme of the show for over ten years now but nevertheless, the song has stood the test of time and continues to have the same effect that it had in 2008. “Hot N Cold” was a part of her second studio album One of the Boys.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. The One That Got Away</b>
      </p>

      <p>A track about lost love, “The One That Got Away” has Katy Perry’s character reminiscing about the love that “got away.” The music video features Perry in an aged avatar and also a goth-like get-up. The 2011 track was a part of the album Teenage Dream.</p>

      <p>Part of Katy Perry’s fifth album Witness, the track released in 2017. The music video features Katy Perry being prepared and served by chefs as a dish which sounds bizarre but packs a punch visually.</p>
