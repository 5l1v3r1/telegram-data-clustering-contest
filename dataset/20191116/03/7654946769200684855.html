      <p>Police checking out reports of an overcrowded daycare in Colorado at first found no kids there at all — then made a shocking discovery.</p>
      <p>Day care workers had hidden 26 preschoolers in a basement behind a false wall, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Cops responded to the Play Mountain Place in Colorado Springs on Wednesday and while they didn’t see any kids at first, they began hearing noises coming from below, officials said.</p>
      <p>The sounds were coming from a phony wall which hid a secret staircase to a finished basement where two adults and the 26 kids were, authorities said.</p>
      <p>None of the kids — who were all under the age of 3 — appeared to be injured or held against their will, police said.</p>
      <p>The day care’s license was suspended, but no one was charged in the incident.</p>
