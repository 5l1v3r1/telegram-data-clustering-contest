      <h3>Faith Yahaya, Abuja</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Following cases of flooding, fire outbreak, building collapse and other disasters across the country, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has estimated that Nigeria may need about N3trllion to curb disasters across the country next year.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Abuja at the launch of a policy document; ‘National Disaster Risk Management Policy’, the Director General of NEMA, Mustapha Maihaja, said the N3trillion would be used to provide short term relief and replacement of damaged infrastructures.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is projected that if we continue with the current business as-usual, an estimated amount of N3trillion will be required to curb and respond to disasters across the 36 states in Nigeria in 2020, and this will be mainly for providing short term relief and replacement of damaged infrastructures.</p>
      <p>“What we are saying is that if major decisions are not taken, Nigeria is susceptible to losing that number of people. So, we need to have good and effective policy in place. We need to respond effectively and efficiently to ensure that we save N3trillion worth items, lives, properties and other related items.”</p>
      <p>The DG also noted that with the launch of the policy, Nigeria will join other countries in achieving target E of the Sendai Framework (2015-2030) as it will enhance disaster risk reduction and management.</p>

      <p>On the importance of the policy document, the DG said: “As we all are aware, Nigeria like other countries in the West African Region and indeed the continent at large has witnessed continuous rise in both natural and human induced disasters which has resulted in loss of lives, large scale displacement, socio economic dislocation and environmental degradation.</p>
      <p>“We have continuously faced a yearly devastating flood which has taken a great toll on all aspects of life and development. We need to shift from our places of comfort and take on disaster risk management with full steam.</p>
