      <p> </p>
      <p>The Nigeria Navy (NN), and her counterparts from France, West and Central Sub regions have commenced a five-day joint sea exercise to contain sea pirates and criminals who engage in oil theft, smuggling, and other vices within the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
      <p>The exercise, code-named Grand African Nemo 2019 and coordinated by the French Navy, was flagged off at the Onne Ports in Rivers State.</p>
      <p>Aimed at supporting efforts of regional navies to counter criminal activities through different operational modes of planned exercises, Grand African Nemo 2019 also brought in representatives of  ministries of Justice, Finance, Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Nigerian Immigrations Service (NIS), Federal Department of Fisheries and other agencies  for improved interagency collaboration in tackling maritime crimes.</p>
      <p>Flagging off the exercise, the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas said the exercise was conceived to achieve the aims of the Yaoundé declaration adopted in June 2013, which would enable countries of the Gulf of Guinea to exchange information regarding maritime crimes and security in the entire Gulf of Guinea region.</p>
      <p>“Two key resolutions of the Declaration were the creation of an Inter- Regional Coordination Centre on Maritime Safety and Security for West and Central Africa to be headquartered in Yaoundé Cameroun. The second resolution was the implementation of a new Code of Conduct on the prevention and repression of piracy, armed robbery against ships and illegal maritime activities in West and Central Africa. The Declaration has been operationalized since the signing of the agreement by Heads of States and Governments of member countries in the same year.</p>
      <p>”Sequel to the Yaoundé Declaration, several inter- regional maritime exercises have been held to improve the cooperation among regional navies in West and Central Africa. This is in recognition of the trans-national nature of maritime insecurity, which requires trans-border cooperation between all users of the common, to mitigate illicit maritime activities the world over.</p>
      <p>”The Exercise GRAND AFRICAN NEMO 2019 is one of such exercises which is aimed at supporting the efforts made by regional navies and allied nations. The Exercise is also being conducted to assist in training regional Maritime Operations Centers in sharing real time information and capacity building,” Ibas said.</p>
      <p>Ibas, who was represented by the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Central Naval Command (CNC),Rear Admiral Suleiman Garba, said simulations to end crude oil theft, piracy and economic sabotage would be undertaken.</p>
      <p>He added that ships would conduct Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS), Search and Rescue, Anti-Piracy and Anti-Poaching , Visual Communications and Casualty Evacuation exercises as well as Fleet Maneuvers in the course of the exercise.</p>
      <p>“The exercise is one of such exercises which are aimed at supporting the efforts made by regional navies and allied nations. The NN is deploying four ships and one helicopter for the exercise to carry out various naval drills together with other foreign ships within Nigeria waters to end crude oil theft and other economic sabotages in the nation’s maritime environment through enhanced patrol and operations.</p>
      <p>“As you are aware, the Nigerian Navy (NN) is not a persecuting agency and that is why we have on board today such agencies as the customs, immigrations, fisheries and particularly the ministry of justice officials who are here to ensure that the process of collection of evidence which will lead to persecution are properly followed in other, to ensure that all criminals that are involved in maritime criminalities are properly prosecuted and put off for good.”</p>
      <p>Four war ships and one helicopter were deployed in the exercise including, Nigerian Navy Ships, NNS Thunder, NNS Okpabana, NNS Sagbama, NNS Dorina and Nigerian Navy Helicopter NNHEL Agusta 109.”</p>
      <p>The first simulation exercise took place within Nigeria Exclusive Economic Zone and between Nigerian Navy Ship Thunder and the French Navy Ship Somme.</p>
      <p>The first day of the exercise witnessed the Special Boat Service (SBS)- the Nigerian Navy Special Force Personnel attached to NNS Thunder while conducting visit board search and seizure(VBSS) simulation exercise on board French Navy Ship Somme arrested the French Ship presumed to be involved in illegal and unregulated fishing activities in Nigerian water.</p>
      <p>Before the arrest of the ship and the crew members, the ship was hijacked by two pirates that were holding the crew members on board the ship hostage.</p>
      <p>The two pirates were arrested, while the eight crew members were rescued by the Special Boat Service, even as they recovered four pistols and four knives from the hostage takers.</p>
      <p>The pirates and crew members were handed over to the prosecuting agency in consonance with the Armed Forces of Nigeria’s Harmonized Standard Operating Procedure.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian Navy personnel on board NNS Thunder repeated the aforesaid drill with French Navy Ship and arrested six crew members and rescued two hostages.</p>
      <p>The Commanding Officer, FNS Germinal, Paul Herouville on the importance of the exercise to France, he said: “I am just here as a captain of the ship so i cannot speak about France. But we proposed a scenario to help to work together to see how they train and vice versa and to learn from each other to improve the ability of both navies to work together. We know there are lots of challenges here such as piracy, illegal fishing, drug trafficking among others”, said Paul.</p>
