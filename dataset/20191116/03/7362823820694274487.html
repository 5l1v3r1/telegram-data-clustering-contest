      <h1>Gregg Jarrett on Trump tweet attacking Yovanovitch during hearing: ‘He had no choice'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T03:05:19+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 03:05</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Nelson</a></address>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> criticized former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-impeachment-hearing-witnesses-who-is-marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a> on Twitter during her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> testimony Friday, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarret said that the commander-in-chief "had no choice."</p>
      <p>“Just look at what happened today: Cross-examination shut down, Republicans can’t call witnesses," Jarrett said on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">“Hannity</a>" "The president has no ability to defend himself so he goes over everybody’s heads to the American people and social media and issues a tweet."</p>
      <p>“It is not ‘witness-intimidation,’” added Jarrett, who pointed out that the president was within his rights to criticize Yovanovitch during her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/yovanovitch-to-face-gop-grilling-as-second-day-of-public-impeachment-hearings-begin">public testimony</a> before the House Intelligence Committee.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Trump tweeted that everywhere Yovanovitch went as a diplomat had "turned bad."</p>
      <p>"She started off in Somalia, how did that go?" Trump wrote. "Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky] spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him.</p>
      <p>"It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors."</p>

      <p>House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., read the tweet to Yovanovitch during the hearing and accused the president of "witness intimidation."</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch is a career foreign service officer with more than 30 years at the State Department, having also served in Somalia, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.</p>

      <p>Jarrett explained further that physically harming or bribing a witness or coercing a witness to lie would constitute witness intimidation under law, not criticizing them on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Jarrett also called the impeachment inquiry a “vaudeville act with Charlie Chaplin at the helm, aka Adam Schiff."</p>
