      <p>We see many of the world’s most popular car brand logos every day on the road, and many petrolheads believe they would be able to name which car logo belongs to each brand with ease.</p>
      <p>However, what happens when small changes are made to each logo? Are motorists still able to choose the correct car badge from its doppelgänger?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.whocanfixmycar.com/">Whocanfixmycar.com</a> has made small changes to 20 of the most recognisable car logos in the world. Can you tell which are real and which are fake? Take this five-minute quiz by expanding the window below to find out if you really know your car brands.</p>
      <p>Simply click on the car logo that you believe is correct, and the fake one will fade away. A “Did you know?” box will then appear, showing you a piece of trivia about the history and origin of all 20 car logos.</p>
