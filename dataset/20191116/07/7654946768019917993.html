      <p>SAN FRANCISCO — Yet another Golden State starter went down with an injury when D’Angelo Russell sprained his right thumb, but the Warriors still made mighty Boston work until the waning moments.</p>
      <p>Jayson Tatum dunked after a jump ball with 1:36 left to put Boston ahead, and the Celtics held off the undermanned Warriors 105-100 on Friday night for their 10th straight win since losing the season opener.</p>
      <p>An out-of-bounds call initially in Golden State’s favor went to replay review and was overturned, leading to the jump ball.</p>
      <p>Kemba Walker hit a 3-pointer with 2:19 to play that pulled Boston to 97-95, then Daniel Theis made one free throw with 1:41 remaining.</p>
      <p>The Warriors got the ball back with 54.3 seconds left on another overturned replay, but Alec Burks missed a 3 that would have tied it and Walker scored on the other end.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to get better and that starts with just competing,” Golden State center Willie Cauley-Stein said. “We’re taking little steps. Today we had a chance to win it.”</p>
      <p>Russell had 12 points and seven assists but also nine of his team’s 19 turnovers before leaving with that aching thumb in the Warriors’ sixth straight defeat. X-rays were negative and he will have an MRI exam.</p>

      <p>Injury-plagued Golden State — playing without Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson — faced the NBA’s top two teams in consecutive games, losing to the Lakers on the road Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“We played our best defensive game of the year. That’s what really matters,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.</p>
      <p>Burks scored 20 points off the bench, making 11 of 12 free throws as Golden State’s cast of youngsters nearly pulled off a November upset by outhustling Boston for much of the night, crashing the boards and creating second chances.</p>
      <p>Jaylen Brown had 22 points and eight rebounds, and Tatum overcame a slow start to score 24 points for the Celtics, who lost Oct. 23 at Philadelphia to start the season before beginning their longest winning streak since 2017.</p>
      <p>“We knew that we were going to get their best shot,” Brown said. “They came out high intensity, they jumped on us early. As we’re a young team, we’re getting used to being the team that’s being (chased) and handling that better.”</p>
      <p>The Warriors hung tough until late, keeping the crowd engaged — something that hasn’t always been the case so far given the early struggles for a franchise that’s reached five straight NBA Finals.</p>
      <p>“Warriors fans have always appreciated high energy, hustle, toughness, great competition,” Kerr said. “You could feel it in the building tonight. Our fans really enjoyed watching our guys compete, and that’s important. We want people to come into this building and be excited about watching our team. It’s been a rough start, but if we can compete that way and play that way we’re going to win some games and our fans will enjoy what we’re doing.”</p>
      <p>Boston had four starters reach double figures in scoring after seven players did so in a 140-133 win against Washington on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Each team was missing a star player following surgery for a broken left hand: Golden State two-time MVP Curry and Boston forward Gordon Hayward, who missed his third straight game and second since the procedure.</p>
