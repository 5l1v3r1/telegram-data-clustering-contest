      <h1>Brazil boss Tite opens up on Lionel Messi row during Argentina defeat</h1>
      <h2>Lionel Messi became involved in an argument with Brazil boss Tite in the first half of Argentina's 1-0 win in Saudi Arabia</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:45:12+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Brazil boss Tite has opened up on his row with Lionel Messi in the first half of their 1-0 defeat to Argentina.</p>
      <p>Messi scored the winner as he bundled in the rebound after his penalty was saved just 14 minutes into their clash in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>He then exchanged words with Tite during the opening half and was seen gesturing at the Brazil boss to be quiet as he complained to the referee.</p>
      <p>And the boss revealed the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> superstar bluntly told him to "shut his mouth" as they clashed.</p>
      <p>Messi ultimately had the last laugh as Argentina condemned their rivals to a fifth straight game without a win - but Tite insists he as right to complain.</p>

      <p>He said: "I complained because he [Messi] should have been shown a yellow card and he told me to shut my mouth and I told him to shut his mouth.</p>
      <p>"And that was it.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to answer anymore on it. You need a strong referee because he'll swallow youâ€¦ It should have been a card, I was right to complain."</p>

      <p>Messi's goal, which ultimately proved the winner, came just minutes after Gabriel Jesus had fired wide from 12 yards when he was given the chance to hand Brazil an early led.</p>
      <p>Messi, making his first international appearance after a three-month suspension, came close to adding a second after the break but was stopped by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> keeper Alisson low to his left.</p>
      <p>He also saw a free-kick tipped over the bar as his side looked the more dangerous in a scrappy encounter between the historic South American rivals.</p>
