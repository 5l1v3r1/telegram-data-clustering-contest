      <h1>Wayne Rooney in, but who goes out? - Decide who Derby County keep or sell</h1>
      <h2>Latest Derby County transfer news | You decide which players the Rams should keep or sell during the January transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Derby County, like the rest of the teams in the Sky Bet Championship, are enjoying a two-week hiatus from action due to the international break.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams</a> are in 16th place in the league table following their latest outing which saw them lose 1-0 to arch rivals Nottingham Forest last weekend.</p>
      <p>Phillip Cocu and his players will rest up before preparing to take on Preston North End on Saturday, November 23 when their league campaign resumes.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-youngsters-3543082">summer transfer window</a> saw Derby recruit six new players, with four of those coming in on loan deals for the campaign.</p>
      <p>Derby will also welcome Wayne Rooney to Pride Park in January in a player-coach role, after he recently left DC United.</p>
      <p>And in terms of outgoings, Cocu allowed nine players to depart while a number of others leave the club after the expiration of their contracts or, in the case of Luke Thomas to Barnsley, via a sale.</p>
      <p>So what will the upcoming January transfer window have in store for the Rams?</p>
      <p>Cocu could look to bring in fresh faces in the New Year in order to galvanise his squad which could enhance the club’s chances of success this season.</p>
      <p>But what about the players that are already at Pride Park?</p>
