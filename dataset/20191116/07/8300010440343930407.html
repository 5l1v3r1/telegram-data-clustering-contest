      <p>BEVERLY HILLS (KABC) -- "Ford V. Ferrari" tells the story of how American car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles figure out how to build a vehicle for the Ford Motor Company that can take on racing powerhouse Ferrari. The goal: to win the 1966 "24 Hours of Le Mans." However, the movie's stars say their film is about much more than racing.<br/><br/>"I'm not a car person so the great signal to me was when I read the script and I loved it so much," said Matt Damon. "It wasn't about the cars. It's about this friendship."<br/><br/>When it comes to all the driving the actors had to do in the film, that's where movie magic came into play. It looked more dangerous than it really was!<br/><br/>"We were always moving very fast, we weren't necessarily in control but that's just because we're bad drivers, isn't it?" laughed Christian Bale.<br/><br/>The role required Bale to often be suited up and then trapped in a small space. It often brought back a claustrophobic memory: being in the "Batman" costume!<br/><br/>"Which was weird when he showed up one day in the Batman outfit and we were, like, 'Dude, it's a racing movie. This isn't appropriate at all!" teased Damon.<br/><br/>"Ford v Ferrari" is rated PG-13 and is in theaters now.</p>
