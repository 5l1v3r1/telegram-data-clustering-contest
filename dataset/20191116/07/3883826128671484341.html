        <b>Joe Denly says he is "as near as 100% fit" to face New Zealand in the first Test after scoring 68 on day two of the warm-up match against New Zealand A.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Denly, who is expected to bat at three, missed the Twenty20 series against the Kiwis after injuring ankle ligaments.</p>
      <p>Jos Buttler and Ollie Pope both scored 88 to also help rescue England after they had fallen to 105-5.</p>
      <p>New Zealand A declared on 302-6 in the final warm-up match before next week's first Test at the Bay Oval in Tauranga.</p>
      <p>Denly, who has notched up half-centuries in each of the last three Tests, added: "When I first did my ankle it was touch and go whether I'd be fit for this game.</p>
      <p>"I've been on the ice machine every hour of every day. I was a little bit emotional when I was sitting in that changing room looking at it and I feared my tour might be over.</p>
      <p>"But it's been really good, responding really well to every day. It's not swelling up and it's in good condition now. Hopefully that can continue."</p>
      <p>England, who had resumed Saturday morning on 26-1, saw captain Joe Root and vice-captain Ben Stokes dismissed for single figures within six balls of each other.</p>
