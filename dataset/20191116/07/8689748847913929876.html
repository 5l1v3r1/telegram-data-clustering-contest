      <p>Screen goddess Efia Odo always set the internet ablaze with her Instagram photos which normally shows almost her nakedness.</p>
      <p>Efia Odo in an interview on Pulse Tv noted that one of the reasons why she goes nude is that her fans love her for her ‘half nude’ appearances.</p>
      <p>According to Kwese Tv presenter, the second reason why she posts half-naked pictures is that she loves seeing herself half-naked too adding that she doesn’t go nude but rather dresses half-naked.</p>
      <p><b>“I don’t get nude. I get half nude and it’s just how I am. I wake up in the morning, if I wanna be fully covered, I’ll be fully covered. If I wanna be half-naked, I can wear a bikini down the street if I want to but I’m in Ghana so I can’t,”</b> she said on Pulse Chat.</p>
      <p><b>“For my brand, I think it kinda does pay off because people love seeing me half-naked and I love seeing myself half-naked,” </b>she added.</p>
      <p>Revealing her secret to keeping her body sexy for the glam, she noted that she eats well to maintain her sexy body because she would not be going half naked if she was a fat person.</p>

        <b>“I think if I was fat I wouldn’t be half-naked but I got a pretty good body so why not show it off”</b>
