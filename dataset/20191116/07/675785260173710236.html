      <p>"There’s a tense stand-off then a massive fight between the two men and two people are shot, including Robert, who dies on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>“He makes it to hospital but suffers a heart attack and dies off-screen in a bit of snub to Tristan. It’s left to Michelle to tell everyone he’s dead.”</p>
      <h3>Gary Windass exposed?</h3>
      <p>The siege is set to come about as Gary Windass' business partner, who he recently threatened, comes looking for revenge.</p>
      <p>A drunk Derek will apparently wave a gun around in the pub, with he and Gary embroiled in a vicious fight.</p>
