      <p>Mbuya Gwena <a href="https://iharare.com/gogo-gwena-delivers-over-100-babies-in-1-week/">grabbed the headlines after she assisted expecting mothers</a> and  delivered about 100 babies last week alone.</p>

      <p>Some of the women who can not afford the costly services of private doctors have turned to Gogo Esther Gwena.</p>
