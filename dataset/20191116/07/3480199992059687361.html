      <p>England batsman Joe Denly feared his tour of New Zealand had been ended by the ankle injury which ruled him out of the Twenty20 series against the Black Caps.</p>
      <p>Denly rolled his right ankle as he fielded on the boundary rope during the closing moments of England’s final practice session before the T20 opener in Christchurch last month.</p>
      <p>The ligament damage he sustained left him doubtful for the Test series but, following a successful rehabilitation programme, he laid any doubts about his fitness to rest on the penultimate day of England’s final warm-up.</p>

      <p>After England had lurched to 105 for five against New Zealand A in Whangarei, Denly led the recovery with a battling 68 from 147 balls, while there were half-centuries for Ollie Pope (88) and Jos Buttler (87no).</p>
      <p>Having helped the tourists close on 355 for eight in response to the home side’s 320 for six declared, Denly cast his mind back to a couple of weeks ago when he worried about the possibility of an early flight home.</p>
      <p>“I was very disappointed when it happened just before the T20 series. When I first did I was probably thinking my tour was over,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It was pretty nasty when I did it. I think I was lucky not to do some real serious damage and it was always touch and go to get ready for this game.</p>

      <p>“But it’s settled down nicely. There’s no discomfort. The running between the wickets and playing all the shots; it feels fine. It’s just a case of monitoring it and making sure it doesn’t swell up overnight.”</p>
      <p>Denly revealed he has been aided in his recovery by an ice machine, adding: “It’s an amazing bit of kit. If it hadn’t been for that, I wouldn’t have been playing. It’s taken down the swelling a lot.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t spent much time outside the hotel room these last few weeks. It’s been a challenge. But it has to be done. You have to put in the hours.</p>
      <p>“One thing from sitting on the sidelines does is make you hungry to get out there and put on the whites and perform.”</p>
      <p>Denly was an ever-present in the 2-2 Ashes draw and ended the series as an opener, but he is expected to drop to three in the order with Dom Sibley set to partner Rory Burns.</p>
      <p>Denly amassed half-centuries in each of the last three Tests against Australia, falling six runs short of a maiden international century in the series finale at The Oval.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was disappointing not to get three figures. But I was dropped on nought and I could have had an lbw shout against me as well.</p>
      <p>“Playing in that Ashes series, being exposed to those bowlers and being the challenge it was, I’ve come out of it a more confident player, and I certainly feel a lot more comfortable within this batting line-up now.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice to get that first Test hundred on this trip. I’m feeling pretty good at the moment out in the middle.”</p>
