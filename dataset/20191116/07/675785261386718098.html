      <h1>Arsenal fans want Santi Cazorla transfer return after ex-Gunner scores for Spain</h1>
      <h2>Cazorla scored his first goal for Spain in four years on Friday - a day after saying he would love a return to the Emirates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:27:08+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:27</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal fan favourite Santi Cazorla rolled back the years as he scored for Spain on Friday - a day after saying he would love a return to the Emirates.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/santi-cazorla">Cazorla</a> scored his first international goal in four years when he fired home from inside the box to double Spain's lead on the way to a 7-0 thrashing of Malta.</p>
      <p>The Spanish playmaker, 34, left the Gunners at the end of the 2017/18 campaign, joining La Liga side Villarreal.</p>
      <p>Having joined from Malaga in the summer of 2012, he scored 29 goals in 180 appearances and helped the team win two Emirates FA Cups and two FA Community Shields.</p>
      <p>Cazorla was highly thought of and respected by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> staff and fans, but saw his final two seasons at the Emirates ruined by a serious of problems after suffering an Achilles injury - with doctors even warning at one point he might never walk again.</p>

      <p>The day before his goal against Malta, Cazorla admitted he regretted never having the chance to say goodbye to Arsenal fans - and said he would love to play at the Emirates again.</p>
      <p>"I miss everything about Arsenal," he said in an interview with the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/santi-cazorla-interview-arsenal-fc-news-villarreal-spain-vs-malta-euro-2020-a9202596.html">Independent</a> .</p>
      <p>"I never got to say a proper goodbye.</p>
      <p>"I donâ€™t know what my legacy is there, you would have to ask the fans, but I want to say thank you to them all.</p>

      <p>"I would like to play at the Emirates one last time before I retire."</p>
      <p>And the feeling is reciprocated, with Arsenal fans on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> saying they'd love to have the midfielder back at the club.</p>
      <p>One said: "Cazorla scoring for Spain, tears in my eyes. Still better than most of our midfielders!"</p>
      <p>Another posted "@Arsenal bring this man back", while another posed the question: "Should @arsenal take back santi cazorla in January for a small fee? And he can play for us until he retires."</p>
