      <h1>Benefits of up to Rs 1.6 lakh on Jeep Compass</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jaiveer Mehra</a></address>
      <p>Jeep dealers are offering substantial benefits on the 2019 model year Compass all through November 2019.</p>
      <p>Jeep is offering big discounts on select variants of the Compass all through November. The Compass SUV is being offered with benefits of up to Rs 1.6 lakh on select engine-gearbox combinations and trim levels.</p>
      <p>The entry-level Sport trim can be had with benefits of up to Rs 1.6 lakh for the 4x2 diesel model, while the petrol equivalent comes with benefits of up to Rs 70,000. The Sport Plus is being offered with substantial benefits of up to Rs 1.1 lakh for the diesel variant, and up to Rs 50,000 for the petrol.</p>
      <p>The Longitude, Longitude (O) and Limited trims in diesel-manual 4x2 spec are being offered with benefits of up to Rs 1.4 lakh, with the Limited (O) trim getting more substantial discounts of up to Rs 1.6 lakh.</p>
      <p>In comparison, the petrol-automatic Longitude (O) and Limited trims get benefits of up to Rs 1.1 lakh, and the Limited (O) trims comes at a discount of Rs 1.40 lakh.</p>
      <p>The above-mentioned benefits do not apply to the Limited Plus, Limited Plus 4x4, Limited 4X4 and Trailhawks.</p>
      <p>The Compass is available with two engine options – a 173hp, 2.0-litre turbo-diesel and a 163hp, 1.4-litre turbo-petrol. The diesel mill is available in both BS4 and BS6 spec (the latter offered only in the Trailhawk). The BS4-compliant unit is paired with a 6-speed manual gearbox as standard, and the BS6-compliant unit is offered solely with a 9-speed automatic. The diesels also get an optional four-wheel drive on higher variants, a feature that's standard on the Trailhawk. The BS4-compliant petrol engine can be had with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.</p>
      <p>Jeep is expected to give the Compass a mid-cycle facelift sometime next year and is also working on introducing the BS6-compliant diesel motor and 9-speed automatic gearbox from the Trailhawk on all variants in the Compass line-up. Also, the 1.4 turbo-petrol is set to be upgraded to meet BS6 norms.</p>
      <p>Another model in the works is said to be a 7-seater derivative of the Compass but it <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/seven-seat-jeep-compass-india-launch-pushed-to-2021-414802">isn't expected to launch before 2021</a></b>.</p>
      <p> As for its rivals, the Compass takes on the <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mg/hector">MG Hector</a></b>, <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/tata/harrier">Tata Harrier</a></b> and the <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/kia/seltos">Kia Seltos</a></b>.</p>
