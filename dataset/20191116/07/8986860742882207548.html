      <p>Ghana’s finest rapper Sarkodie has taken to social media to ask his wife Tracy Sarkcess to please give him a baby boy since he already has a girl.</p>
      <p>It was reported on major news portals around the country that Tracy Sarkcess was pregnant with their second child but neither the rapper or his wife has come out to deny or confirm this.</p>
      <p>In the post on Instagram, BET Award winner shared a random photo of a baby boy playing on a sofa with the caption: “Need a baby boy.”</p>
      <p>See his post below:</p>

      <p>Judging from Sarkodie’s post, it unofficially tells us that truly his wife is pregnant and he expects her to give him “Lil Sark” to take over when he is not around.</p>
