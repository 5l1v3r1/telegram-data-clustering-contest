      <p>London - Four-time winners <b>Toulouse </b>roared back in the second half against <b>Gloucester </b>to begin their <b>Champions Cup </b>challenge with a 25-20 win on Friday in the opening match of the competition.</p>
      <p>Scrumhalf Joe Simpson scored two outstanding runaway tries to give the English side a 20-9 half-time lead but Toulouse regrouped to score 16 unanswered points in the second period.</p>
      <p>Danny Cipriani converted Simpson's tries and kicked two penalties to complete the scoring for Gloucester.</p>
      <p>Sebastien Bezy scored a try for Toulouse, which Thomas Ramos converted as well as kicking four penalties, and Romain Ntamack kicked another penalty and Zack Holmes added a drop goal.</p>
      <p>Springbok flank <b>Rynhardt Elstadt </b>was a star for Toulouse, producing a man-of-the-match performance which saw him terrorise Gloucester's lineout.</p>
      <p>In his post-match interview, Elstadt revealed that his friendship with former Stormers team-mate and Gloucester lock Gerbrandt Grobler helped him read the opposition lineout.</p>

        <b>English side cracked</b>
      </p>
      <p>Toulouse took an early advantage with a Holmes drop goal before the hosts scored a sparkling opening try.</p>
      <p>From just outside their 22, Gloucester nicked a lineout for Simpson to burst away and exchange passes with Matt Banahan before the scrum-half ran 55 metres to just hold off Ramos's tackle.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes later, Simpson got an even better one, running 80 metres to score after Toulouse lost possession.</p>
      <p>Two Ramos penalties were followed by one from Cipriani to give Gloucester the half-time advantage.</p>
      <p>Toulouse introduced Scotland international lock Richie Gray and withdrew Holmes at the break and the changes paid immediate dividends when Ntamack and Ramos both kicked penalties to reduce the deficit.</p>
      <p>Thanks to dogged Gloucester defending the score was 20-15 going into the final quarter but the English side cracked in the face of intense pressure and Bezy scored the crucial try which Ramos converted.</p>
      <p>Mark Atkinson was penalised for a late tackle and Ramos knocked over the resulting kick to complete Toulouse's comeback.</p>
