      <p>A number of weather records have tumbled in Perth today as temperatures soared above 40C in the capital and across Western Australia.</p>
      <p>The mercury hit 40.4 degrees in Perth just after lunchtime as the capital sweltered through its hottest November day since records began.</p>
      <p>The record breaking temperature hit at 1.20pm at the Perth Metro weather station in Mount Lawley - surpassing the previous record of 40.3 degrees set in November 24, 1913, and matched again on November 11, 2003.</p>
      <p>And following on from a hot stretch this week, when the temperature hit over 35C at 11.30am this morning it meant another record was matched.</p>
      <p>It’s just the second time in history that Perth has experienced four consecutive November days at 35C or above - matching a record set in 1933.</p>
      <p>A Bureau of Meteorology spokesman said Pearce RAAF base had also broken its former November record of 41.6 degrees, reaching 42.5 degrees today, while Perth Airport broke its November record as it registered a high of 41.1 degrees.</p>
      <p>Spare a thought for other parts of the state however, where the temperature reached reached over 45C in some areas.</p>
      <p>Port Hedland registered the highest temperature across WA today, with a high of 45.8C. It was one of three areas in the Pilbara to see temperatures over 45C with Marble Bar and Roeburn also registering soarchers.</p>
      <p>In the Kimberley, Fitzroy Crossing hit midday temperatures of 44.6C while the mercury reached above 40C in Laverton, Leonora and Kalgoorlie-Boulder in the Goldfields.</p>
      <p>It was a similar story in the Central Wheatbelt while the typically cooler regions of Great Southern and Southwest also saw highs of 40C (Newdegate) and 37.4C (Bridgetown) respectively.</p>
      <p>Fortunately there will be a break from the warmer weather on the horizon in Perth with a maximum of 21 degrees and possible rain this week on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Stephen McInerney said the record breaking temperatures would ease tomorrow with easterly winds blowing the warm air mass into the Goldfields.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen a long period of easterly winds on the south of WA causing this hot weather,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Today is the last hot day for Perth, but there is going to potential record breaking temperatures in the Southern Cross and near Kalgoorlie as the air mass moves eastwards.</p>
      <p>“A weak cold front on Monday will bring cooler temperatures into next week.”</p>
