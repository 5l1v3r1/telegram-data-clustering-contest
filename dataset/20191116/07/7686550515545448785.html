      <p>Parents are outraged after one primary school banned children from bringing both parents to their Christmas carol concert. <br/><br/>Lady Boswell Primary School in Kent said there was no room in the church to seat all of their 256 pupils' parents, so children are only allowed to bring one.<br/><br/>Parents have said it's "disgraceful" and "heartbreaking" to make children choose between their parents. <br/><br/>One angry mother, Ren McCann, said: “If you haven't got room to accommodate two guests per child, then don't do a nativity. <br/><br/>“You can't make a child pick what parent they want to attend.” <br/><br/>Parents are now asking for the event to be held over two days, so that everyone can attend. <br/><br/>Daisy Day said: “My children would’ve been heartbroken to have only one parent attend such a big event. <br/><br/>“We are used to being overcrowded for certain events. <br/><br/>“So it should continue as it is or the service should be split, but don’t split the families.” <br/><br/>Susan Richards said: “It’s disgraceful. You cannot do that when siblings and parents are proud of their little ones.” <br/><br/>Linda Sanders also disagreed with the school's decision, saying: “It’s very sad. They should be promoting family values and togetherness”.</p>

      <p>Head teacher, Sharon Saunders, has since responded to the situation saying: “Lady Boswell’s School prides itself on keeping its pupils’ best interests at the heart of all that it does.</p>
      <p>“Due to the transition from one to two form entry, we have had to restructure some of our community events in order to accommodate the increased numbers of children, staff and family members". <br/><br/>However, after receiving disappointed messages from parents about the decision, the head teacher has revised her plan in order to accommodate more than one parent.</p>
      <p>She said: “Last year, at the Carol Service, there were concerns about the safety and comfort of all those present and we were forced to reconsider how to seat members of the Lady Boswell’s family. <br/><br/>"Our initial plan was to have every child seated and, as a result, this meant that we could only offer one seat to a family member. Having received a number of messages from parents expressing their disappointment, we reviewed our seating plan and reverted to the children sitting on the floor. This has allowed us to offer two seats in the congregation to family members.</p>
      <p>“We very much look forward as a school community to celebrating the birth of our Saviour, and to sharing the peace and goodwill that this season brings”.</p>
