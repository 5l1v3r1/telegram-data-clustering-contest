      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:50:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:50</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> looks just as amazing on screen today as she did 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain presenter first popped up on telly back in 1994, when she joined the south edition of ITV News Central as a reporter and news presenter.</p>
      <p>Over the years, she's appeared on GMTV and Daybreak, presented Too Many Cooks and The Biggest Loser, and even twirled on the dancefloor on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> in 2007.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow night, we'll see her making her way into the jungle and taking on the most dangerous opening night task ever.</p>
      <p>Pictures showed Kate arriving to meet her new campmates looking stunning in a red jumpsuit.</p>
      <p>But how has she remained so glam all these years?</p>

      <p>A surgeon from Glow by <a href="https://www.mya.co.uk/">MYA</a> said: "It is possible that Kate has had the non-surgical treatment of Dermal Fillers to her cheeks often referred to as 'cheek fillers'.</p>
      <p>"Dermal fillers can be used in this area to re-introduce structure and volume along the cheekbone just like in Kate’s case.</p>
      <p>"For many other women, fillers are used to plump up skin sections, as plumpness can be lost with the natural ageing process that both men and women go through. The procedure replaces soft tissue whilst filling in wrinkles/skin folds.</p>

      <p>"Fillers can range in price depending on the area and amount used - between £150 - £500 per session."</p>
      <p>The expert added: "I would suggest Kate has had anti-wrinkle injections, often referred to as Botox, to her forehead and around her eyes (crow’s feet).</p>
      <p>"This non-surgical treatment will create a smooth forehead and limit any frown/expression lines. The treatment will normally last 3-6 months - as muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to reappear and need to be treated again.</p>

      <p>"This procedure can give the appearance of smoother skin if you are after a youthful appearance, or it can be used as a preventative measure to slow the process of getting fine lines or wrinkles."</p>
