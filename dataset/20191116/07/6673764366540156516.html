      <p>Messaging app provider Line Corp. and the company controlling Yahoo Japan Corp. are considering merging their operations by the end of 2020, sources familiar with the matter said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Yahoo Japan operator Z Holdings Corp., which is a SoftBank Group Corp. holding company, and Line may announce their merger plan as early as next week, the sources said.</p>
      <p>SoftBank and Line hope to expand their internet businesses, including online retailing, advertising and mobile phone services, the sources said.</p>
      <p>In fiscal 2018, which ended in March, Z Holdings posted group sales of ¥954.7 billion while Line had sales of ¥207.1 billion in the business year ended last December.</p>
      <p>Their combined sales would be the largest among the nation’s online business operators, surpassing those of e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc.</p>
      <p>Line has about 164 million users of its messaging app in Japan, Taiwan and Southeast Asia, while more than 50 million people visit Yahoo Japan’s website each month.</p>
      <p>The two companies plan to operate their smartphone payment services separately while seeking to improve efficiency and convenience.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings’ PayPay service has 19 million customers and Line Pay has 37 million.</p>
      <p>The companies will consider eventually merging their digital payment businesses, depending on the outcome of an antitrust review, the sources said.</p>
      <p>SoftBank and South Korea’s Naver Corp., the parent company of Line, are considering merging the units under a new joint company, other sources have said.</p>
