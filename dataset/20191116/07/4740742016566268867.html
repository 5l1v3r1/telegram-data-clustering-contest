      <h1>Why Bristol has been named one of the 'most pleasant' places to live in Britain</h1>
      <h2>The research covered everything from how many parks there are to how many charity volunteers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>We’ve been called the coolest, the trendiest, the most creative, the happiest and most friendly, and now Bristol has been given another accolade - it’s been named one of the ‘most pleasant’ places to live in Britain.</p>
      <p>The tag has been awarded by storage firm <a href="https://www.safestore.co.uk/">Safestore</a>, who undertook what appears to be a fairly comprehensive assessment of data covering everything from how charitable people are to how much green space there is per person.</p>
      <p>And in comparing Britain’s major cities, Bristol does not come out too shoddily at all, thank you very much.</p>
      <p>Safestore broke it all down into four different areas of life - wellbeing, charity, young people and care, and analysed data in all four different areas.</p>
      <p>And in all four, Bristol consistently performed well, finishing in the top four cities for almost everything, way ahead of the likes of Newcastle, Birmingham, Manchester and London.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, places like Edinburgh and Cardiff matched Bristol on being seen as ‘pleasant’.</p>
      <h3>Charity</h3>

      <p>Bristol is among the top cities in the country for the number of charity shops, events and jobs in the charity sector - a sign of a generous city which looks after those less fortunate or raises money for good causes.</p>
      <p>In all, it finishes fourth, but misses out on third probably only because Edinburgh has a disproportionately larger number of registered charities - because it’s Scotland’s capital.</p>
      <h3>Young people</h3>

      <p>Safestore added together the amount of parks, the number of good schools and the student satisfaction to put Bristol right up there again, compared with other cities.</p>
      <p>We’ve got the most parks per km2 - bar Cardiff - and the highest level of student satisfaction - bar Leeds - but compared to the rest of the country, our schools are not great. For every 100,000 of population, Bristol has only 0.41 Ofsted outstanding-rated schools, compared with 9.66 in Newcastle, and 4.61 in Manchester.</p>
      <h3>Care and well being</h3>

      <p>And when it comes to well being, Bristol doesn’t do too badly either - although isn’t exactly great.</p>
      <p>It has a health 6.56 different volunteering opportunities per 10,000 people, compared with two or three in Birmingham and Glasgow, while only London and Manchester has fewer hospices per 100,000 people.</p>
