      <p><b>Jennifer Aniston</b> is getting plastic surgery to fix her “saggy” knees? That’s the bizarre claim in one tabloid this week. <b>Gossip Cop</b> found the whole thing to be ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Although the <i><b>Globe</b></i> does give Aniston credit for still having “a killer bod at age 50,” it says her “saggy knees” are the one problem with her appearance. Using the ridiculous headline, “Jen’s Knees To Go Under The Knife,” the magazine claims Aniston is “obsessed” and “horrified” at the look of the “sagging joints,” which is especially problematic since Aniston “adores flashing a bit of leg.”</p>
      <p>“She loves her body and she’s really proud of the way she looks, but she hates the excess skin on her knees and thinks it’s aging her,” an anonymous “insider” tells the outlet. The tipster adds that Aniston has “tried exercises and beauty creams” to fix the “excess” skin, but her joints “still look all wrinkly, and that may look good on an elephant — but not an A-list star.” The unknown source concludes, “Jen’s talking to experts about quick surgery fixes like firming laser treatments.”</p>
      <p>Despite what the tabloid’s unidentified “insider” says, Aniston’s spokesperson completely denies the story. Meanwhile, the outlet can’t get its story straight, as it jumps from its bold headline about Aniston going “under the knife” to its weaker claims in the article itself about Aniston merely considering surgical options. That’s besides the point, however, because the actress isn’t doing anything about her perfectly normal knees. Even the tabloid’s photo of her “sagging” knees shows two normal knees. We can’t begin to figure out what exactly the outlet or its source is referring to in any photo of Aniston.</p>
      <p>Plus, this an all-too-familiar story from the <i>Globe</i>. In September, <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked the tabloid’s false claims about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-plastic-surgery-feet/">Katie Holmes also getting plastic surgery</a> to “fix” her feet, the one part of her body that she didn’t like. Much like its Aniston article, the magazine avoids specifying what exactly is wrong with the actress’s body part in favor of just repeating that she wants surgery over and over. The tabloid has simply changed out the actress and body part, but the rest of the story is basically the same.</p>
      <p>The <i>Globe </i>is the same outlet that’s also responsible for the bogus story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-secretly-eloped-mexico-married/">Aniston secretly remarrying Brad Pitt</a> while on vacation in Mexico earlier this year. As <b>Gossip Cop</b> noted at the time, the tabloid had to use doctored photos to try to back up that false premise. Earlier this week, it even tried to argue that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-angelina-jolie-marvel-movies-diss-attack/">Aniston was trying to diss Angelina Jolie</a> by mentioning that she wasn’t interested in acting in Marvel movies. The tabloid simply can’t get it right when it comes to Aniston’s personal or professional life.</p>
