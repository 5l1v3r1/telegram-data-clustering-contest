      <p>Many people believe their dream house is out of reach but David Wilson Homes say if you intervene in the early stages of the home build, it's entirely possible to have the personalised home that you've always wanted. <br/><br/>The house builders offer a bespoke service called 'Expressions'; this allows buyers to build, upgrade and add extras to their property before they even move in.<br/><br/>Ellis Hutchinson (23), coordinator for David Wilson's 'Expressions' service said: “Expressions completes the experience of buying new. We offer a fantastic range of options that customers can choose to make their house a home.</p>
      <p>“Everything is fitted before you move in and it really is a special moment on moving in day, walking through the door to see the sparkly kitchen, new tiles and flooring you have chosen.”</p>

      <h3>Top tips on home personalisation</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Start early</b>
      </p>
      <p>A lot of functional and style decisions need to be made early on if you want the home of your dreams.</p>
      <p>Ellis said: “It’s always best for a customer to reserve their property before the roof has been installed, simply because they will have the opportunity to tailor their vision of a new home.”<br/><br/>Once the foundations have been laid, there's approximately 15 weeks before the roof can be fitted; before this the kitchen, wall tiles and electrics need to be ordered.</p>

      <p><b>Focus on the finer details</b> <br/>Getting a new home shouldn't be stressful; it should be an exciting experience and choosing the right colours and fixtures for your home is the most fun part.<br/><br/>You'll need to decide which carpets or style of flooring you want to lay down.<br/><br/>You will also need to browse through worktop options, choosing one that fits into the design scheme of your home. <br/><br/>Ellis said: “Through establishing a great working relationship with quality brands, we know our properties are fitted with sustainable and quality products.</p>
      <p>“We like to make sure we are keeping wall tiles, flooring options and wardrobes up-to-date and on trend, and customers can also choose to personalise their electrics, whether that’s adding more down lights or moving their sockets to a more desirable location.”<br/><br/><b>Take advantage of the 'personal assistant' experience</b></p>
      <p>Workers at David Wilson Homes make all of the tricky decisions for you, able to recommend extras and design features they feel are right for you.</p>
      <p>Once you've reserved a slot, you'll get some one-to-one time with a sales advisor who will talk through the Expressions range with you.</p>
      <p>You'll be able to access your unique 'wish list' and also get some free samples to make sure they're perfect for you.</p>
      <p>Ellis said: “We want to show our customers how valued they are and this means providing a five star experience to help them.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big decision, as these items will be fitted for a number of years and we want to make sure they are aware of all of the options.”</p>
