      <h2>Nottingham Forest news | On the anniversary of Pierre van Hooijdonk's return from strike, Nottinghamshire Live talks exclusively to one man who saw it unfold before his very eyes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Pierre van Hooijdonk.</p>
      <p>One of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s more controversial strikers and one that delighted and frustrated in equal measure, so it’s therefore no wonder that Dave Beasant chuckles when the Dutchman’s name crops up in conversation.</p>
      <p>How can you have <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/the-club-deserves-higher-nottingham-3468458">a lengthy discussion with Beasant</a> and not have the rather thorny subject of Pierre’s antics involved somewhere?</p>
      <p>It’s a little over two decades since the Dutchman returned from his three-month absence, having taking umbrage with decisions made by the Forest board following their promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/now-former-nottingham-forest-goalkeeper-2526237">Beasant was in the dressing room</a> when Pierre, now 49 returned back after his self-imposed exile, and recalls what life was like on Trentside as the club battled for its top flight survival and ultimately succumbed.</p>

      <p>“The season we got promoted, Pierre was unbelievable. We all know what he was like with his goal record,” the 60-year-old tells <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/">NottinghamshireLive</a>.</p>
      <p>“If we got a free-kick outside the box, it was like having a penalty because he was that lethal, he was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“He was quite outspoken and he had an agenda.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, his agenda was benefiting Nottingham Forest Football Club, so it was okay.”</p>
      <p>Van Hooijdonk decided he wouldn’t turn up for work after being denied a move, and also feeling frustrated at key players including Kevin Campbell being sold, and Beasant admits that the striker struggled to reintegrate upon his return, with the Reds lying bottom of the table devoid of confidence.</p>
      <p>“That period when he decided he wasn’t going to come in, he let everyone down,” said Beasant.</p>
      <p>“He let the fans down, but most importantly he let himself down.</p>
      <p>“We all wanted him to come back and if he had of done, he’d have been a hero.</p>
      <p>“The fact he left it too long to come back, he lost the inner confines of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/pierre-van-hooijdonks-reason-going-2725935">the dressing room</a>.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot of talk about players wanting to chin him when he came into the dressing room.</p>
      <p>“It never happened because Pierre came in as if he hadn’t done anything wrong and the fact is, sometimes players have a lot of bravado and when it comes to it, they don’t go through with it.”</p>

      <p>Van Hooijdonk’s first game, typically, was the East Midlands meeting with Derby County at the City Ground, and as you may well have predicted, he scored in a 2-2 draw and famously celebrated his header by celebrating on his own.</p>
      <p>“When he decided to come back, it wasn’t the same,” Beasant said. "Players didn’t have that trust and belief in him as much as we did the season before – it was a sad end getting relegated out of the Premier League.”</p>
      <p>Following the departure of Dave Bassett and a caretaker spell from Micky Adams, Ron Atkinson was appointed – an arrival which didn’t go down too well with some of the City Ground players, including the ex-Forest stopper.</p>
      <p>“It was a difficult period, obviously, and with Ron (Atkinson) coming in – Ron was a manager that had a CV, though for me, he never lived up to anything," he said.</p>
      <p>“He’d had this great track record.</p>
      <p>“I found that training was for Ron, it wasn’t for the team or for working on things, it was for Ron.</p>
      <p>“He’d try and join in with things, he’d join in with crossing sessions and then he would come and take me for a goalkeeping session.</p>
      <p>“Ron would be hitting balls from the six-yard box into the corners, saying ‘come on Big Man’ and I’m thinking, ‘you’ve never played in goal and you just have not got a clue on what I need to be working on’.”</p>

      <p>Beasant recalls the time at training where he watched on in amazement as Atkinson and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/dave-bassett-compares-chelseas-stand-334130">van Hooijdonk</a> enjoyed a verbal exchange, in what proved to be a short stint at Forest, leaving after relegation was confirmed that summer.</p>
      <p>“He had this larger than life character.</p>
      <p>“We had a training session and Pierre wasn’t very happy with the training, Ron questioned him so Pierre wasn’t too impressed so Ron told him to go inside.</p>
      <p>“It was at the time Ron had an advert on the television for Carling, with him being a mediaeval manager kicking tin cans down the road, it was like a pub manager.</p>

      <p>“Pierre, as he was walking off turned and said: ‘Ron, you’re very good in that advert, because that’s what <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/pierre-van-hooijdonk-reveals-called-3424807">you’re like, a pub team manager.</a>'</p>
      <p>“Ron was always very quick with his ripostes and one-liners, he was silent.</p>
      <p>“He’d joke about it later on would Ron, and say ‘he had me there’ and just didn’t have a clue, he couldn’t come back from that.</p>
      <p>“We all had our indifferences with Ron.”</p>
