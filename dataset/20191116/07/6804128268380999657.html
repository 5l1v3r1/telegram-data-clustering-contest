      <h1>Pulisic, Rudiger, Barkley - The latest Chelsea injury news ahead of Manchester City trip</h1>
      <h2>The Blues have several players currently out injured as Frank Lampard prepares his Chelsea side to face Manchester City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:35:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:35</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Harbord, Robert Warlow, Tashan Deniran-Alleyne</a></address>
      <p>While it may have come at a bad time for Chelsea, after picking up their sixth league win in a row, there is one good aspect of the international break coming around.</p>
      <p>The two-week hiatus gives players struggling with their fitness a chance to step up their recovery.</p>
      <p>Chelsea currently have one of the bigger injury lists in the Premier League, and head coach Frank Lampard will be relishing the return of the injured players.</p>
      <p>The Blues are next in Premier League action when they take on current Premier League Champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, and the Chelsea boss will be looking to have as many players as possible available for selection.</p>
      <p>With that said, here's the latest Chelsea injury news and expected return dates.</p>
      <h3>Christian Pulisic</h3>
      <p>Chelsea face an anxious wait to discover the full extent of Christian Pulisic's hip injury after USA head coach Gregg Berhalter confirmed the winger will miss the upcoming international matches.</p>
      <p>"Christian is officially at this stage ruled out," he said.</p>

      <p>"We just got that information. This was a collaborative decision with the club looking after the best interest of the player.</p>
      <p>"These decisions are always difficult because this group and the coaching staff want nothing more than to have Christian here, but it was a risk we weren’t willing to take at this time."</p>
      <p>Pulisic confirmed via his Twitter account that he is London, with <a href="https://www.premierinjuries.com/injury-table.php">PremierInjuries</a> rating the American's chance of being fit for the match against Manchester City at 25%.</p>

      <p>Pulisic has been in fine form for the Blues in recent weeks, with his goal against Crystal Palace on Saturday his fifth of the season.</p>
      <h3>Antonio Rudiger</h3>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger had appeared to have given Frank Lampard a welcome injury boost by declaring himself fit for the Blues' recent trip to Watford.</p>
      <p>The German centre back underwent knee surgery in the summer and has missed a good majority of the season, but won't be available until at least after the international break following an operation at the beginning of the week.</p>
      <p>"He had an operation and he is going to be out probably for three weeks, hopefully,"<a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/lampard-chelsea-press-conference-live-17218718">Lampard confirmed at his pre-Crystal Palace press conference</a>. "Then we will have to see where match fitness comes in because he has been out for a long time now.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"It was nice to get something definitive about it because we have been trying to find a solution and he has been having some issues. It is not easy for a player in that position. So hopefully we are at that stage and hopefully in three weeks time we are in a lot better place."</p>
      <p>Rudiger is not likely to face Manchester City, but could be available for selection next month.</p>
      <h3>Ross Barkley</h3>
      <p>The midfielder has not featured since the 1-0 win against Newcastle United last month.</p>
      <p>He has been missing since after picking up an ankle injury in the victory, with Lampard confirming that Barkley wouldn't be fit enough to make the squad for the visit of Crystal Palace.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The England international was initially called up to Gareth Southgate's squad for the international fixtures against Montenegro and Kosovo over the international break.</p>
      <p>But, that the midfielder is not part of the England squad for the qualifiers after pulling out because of the injury.</p>
      <p>And Barkley remains a doubt to face Manchester City after the international break.</p>
      <h3>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</h3>
      <p>Loftus-Cheek was establishing himself as a key member of Maurizio Sarri's squad at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>However, in the post-season friendly ahead of the Europa League final, Loftus-Cheek suffered the same injury as Hudson-Odoi as he ruptured his Achilles' tendon.</p>
      <p>The midfielder is still undergoing rehabilitation, with Loftus-Cheek working towards a return as soon as possible.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"It’s going well!" he recently told <a href="https://versus.uk.com/2019/11/im-coming-back-stronger-ruben-loftus-cheek-ready-return-already-eyes-euro-2020/">Versus</a> when asked about his recovery from injury.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a long time and I’ve had a few setbacks as well. It’s never been just a straight path but I’m close now…I’ve been running and moving, I feel I’m right on the edge. I’m close and I can’t wait."</p>
      <p>However, Lampard has <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/rudiger-loftus-cheek-chelsea-injuries-17225279">warned it could still be a while yet before the midfielder</a> is available for selection.</p>
      <p>A conditional return date of mid December has been suggested by PremierInjuries.</p>

      <h3>Marco van Ginkel</h3>
      <p>The midfielder is a long term absentee, as he continues his rehabilitation following an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman is on the way to recovery, having posted a video of himself working on the anti-gravity treadmill at the club's training ground.</p>
