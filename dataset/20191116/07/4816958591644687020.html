      <p>Anthony Davis blocked Harrison Barnes’ layup with 2.3 seconds left, allowing the Los Angeles Lakers to defeat the visiting Sacramento Kings 99-97 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>LeBron James scored 18 of his 29 points in the second half and recorded 11 assists as the Lakers captured their 10th win in 11 games.</p>
      <p>Davis, who returned after missing one game due to a sore shoulder and ribs, finished with 17 points and four blocks. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 16 points for Los Angeles, and Kyle Kuzma chipped in 13, all in the first half.</p>
      <p>Buddy Hield had 21 points, hitting a game-high six 3-pointers, and added eight rebounds for the Kings. Bogdan Bogdanovic finished with 18 points while Richaun Holmes had 17 points and eight rebounds.</p>
      <p>A three-point play by Bogdanovic tied the score at 95 with 2:05 remaining. A layup by James gave the Lakers a two-point edge with 1:50 left before Bogdanovic knotted it again on a bucket with 22.1 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Two free throws by James with 5.5 seconds remaining were the difference.</p>
      <p>The Kings took their biggest lead, 42-29, after a 3-pointer by Yogi Ferrell, who had 14 points, four minutes into the second quarter. However, the Lakers closed the half on a 20-8 run to cut the gap to 50-49 at the break.</p>
      <p>The Lakers’ streak of four consecutive games with 30 or more assists ended. They finished with 22 assists to 24 for the Kings.</p>
      <p>Sacramento used its 3-point shooting to stay close, converting 16 of 39 attempts to 11 of 37 for Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Kings coach Luke Walton faced the Lakers for the first time since they “mutually” parted ways at the end of last season after three campaigns as head coach.</p>
      <p>Starting guard Avery Bradley, one of the Lakers’ top perimeter defenders, missed the game with a hairline fracture in his right leg. Bradley will be re-evaluated in one to two weeks, the club announced.</p>
      <p>The Kings played their second game without point guard De’Aaron Fox, who is expected to miss a month with a severe left ankle sprain.</p>
