      <h1>I was hypersexualised as a teenager in Hollywood: Scarlett Johansson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:13:56+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>In a recent turn of events, Scarlett Johansson claimed that she was “hypersexualised” as a teenager in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>In a conversation with the <i><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/jennifer-lopez-scarlett-johansson-lupita-nyong-o-drama-actress-roundtable-1254056">The Hollywood Reporter</a> </i>the <i>Avengers </i>star spoke about how an image of her was created “by a bunch of dudes” who triggered the narrative that she was an “on-screen siren”.</p>
      <p>Other celebrities including big names like Jennifer Lopez, Lupita Nyong’o, Laura Dern, Akwafina and Renee Zellweger, were also present during the discussion when the celebrity explained how she  became “frustrated” by being portrayed as the seductive woman through her twenties.</p>
      <p>“When I was working in my early twenties, and even my late teens, I felt that I got somehow typecast as hypersexualised, which I guess at the time seemed okay to everyone,” she said.</p>
      <p>She then explained how her roles were created by a bunch of men in the industry who called the shots. “It was another time – even though it wasn’t part of my own narrative, it was kind of crafted for me by probably a bunch of dudes in the industry.”</p>

      <p>On a positive note however, Johansson claimed that the world is a better place now and there are various roles for women that do not require one to merely be an eye candy. “The climate is so different now, there are so many wonderful opportunities for women of every age to play all different types of people.”</p>
      <p>Nyong’o contributed her own thoughts to roles in Hollywood, making a point about how she was keen for representation to not be “a fad”.</p>
      <p>“I’m very grateful to have come into the industry at the time that I did because I am benefiting from the efforts of a lot of other women who have come before me,” she added while referring to the struggles of women of colour. “There were so many other black women who have had it a lot rougher than I have,” she said.</p>
      <p>“This is a time where there is a concerted effort to consider diversity and inclusion. What I really want is it to not be a fad, not be a trend. Right now, it’s really dope and cool and on-trend to work with women and underrepresented groups, but the moment of maturity in the industry is when it’s just the norm.”</p>
      <p>Johansson’s most recent project is a starring role opposite Adam Driver in Noah Baumbach’s <i>Marriage Story.</i></p>
