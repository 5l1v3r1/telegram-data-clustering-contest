      <p>Tensions rose after the elimination of Baha Abu al-Ata, a top commander from the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, by Israel. According to the IDF, over 450 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip at Israel.</p>
      <p>The Palestinian Health Ministry <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911161077320996-idf-says-intercepted-two-rockets-fired-from-gaza-strip/">reported at least 34 dead</a> and many more injured following the air raids, urging the UN to stop the IDF from carrying out airstrikes.</p>
      <p>A ceasefire was allegedly reached on Thursday, but Israel reported a new round of rocket fire from Gaza just hours later.</p>
