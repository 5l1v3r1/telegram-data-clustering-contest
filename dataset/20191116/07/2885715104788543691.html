      <h2>Bigg Boss 13: Sidharth Shukla, Shehnaz Gill, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, Paras Chhabra, Vishal Aditya Singh, Mahira Sharma, Arti Singh, Kesari Yadav, Himanshi Khurana, Arhaan Khan and Asim Riaz were nominated for eviction this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T07:24:40+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 07:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>This week, as many as eleven contestants got nominated for eviction from Bigg Boss 13 house. Sidharth Shukla, Shehnaz Gill, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devoleena-bhattacharjee">Devoleena Bhattacharjee</a>, Paras Chhabra, Vishal Aditya Singh, Mahira Sharma, Arti Singh, Kesari Yadav, Himanshi Khurana, Arhaan Khan and Asim Riaz all had to make sure to give viewers some content to survive another week in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a> hosted show.</p>
      <p>While it was not a big deal for Sidharth, Shehnaz and Asim to be at the centre of all the action, Devoleena, Arti, Mahira, Paras and others struggled to attract the attention of the cameras. The ones who failed to do anything significant were Kesari, Arhaan and Himanshi.</p>
      <p>We conducted a poll to ask the readers of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> who they wish to see walk out of Bigg Boss 13 this week. Mahira Sharma got maximum votes (39.5%) followed by Kesari’s 15.3 % votes. Arti and Arhaan stood close with 11.51% and 7.83% votes respectively. Vishal Aditya Singh who entered the house this week got minimum votes hinting towards his popularity among his fans.</p>

        </p>
        <p>However, considering Mahira and Arti have been in the house from the beginning and both get some screen time by jumping into other people’s fights, their chances of leaving the house look weak. On the other hand, Kesari and Arhaan hardly do anything for the cameras to notice.</p>

        <p>Now, who from Mahira, Kesari, Arti and Arhaan will leave the house in this week’s Weekend Ka Vaar with Salman Khan, will be known soon.</p>
