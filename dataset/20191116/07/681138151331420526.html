        <b>An inquest has been opened into the death of an 80-year-old man whose breathing problems may have been caused by him keeping canaries and cockatiels at his home.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hugh Harrison, from Thetford, died at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds on August 18 after being admitted with breathing difficulties.</p>
      <p>An inquest opening, at Suffolk Coroner's Court in Ipswich, heard his health deteriorated days after being taken into hospital.</p>
      <p>Coroner's officer Julie Leacock told the inquest he had been exposed to dust as a welder and had also kept canaries and cockatiels in his house.</p>
      <p>She said it was suspected that his exposure to industrial dust or his pet birds may have worsened his chest problems.</p>
      <p>An independent case review is set to take place on December 23.</p>
      <p>Senior coroner Nigel Parsley adjourned the inquest until February 17 next year.</p>
