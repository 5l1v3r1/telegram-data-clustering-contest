      <p>A Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) student was on Friday evening arrested by DCI detectives for faking her abduction.</p>
      <p>The 19 year old girl was apprehended at the Thika Road Mall (TRM) alongside her boyfriend.</p>
      <p>The teenager is said to have contacted her brother demanding that he sends Sh20,000 to her phone, a request he agreed to.</p>

      <p>Immediately after depositing the “ransom”, her phone was switched off.</p>
      <p>“The brother immediately sent the money to her phone after which the phone was switched off,” the DCI said.</p>
      <p>Later, her boyfriend was contacted and asked to report to the nearest police station to record a statement regarding the abduction.</p>
      <p>It is then that she switched on her phone and contacted her mother.</p>
      <p>“The lady immediately switched on her phone &amp; called the mother saying she had just been dropped at Galleria Mall in Karen. Upon arrest, it was established that the Sh20,000 was still in her Mpesa account,” DCI added.</p>
