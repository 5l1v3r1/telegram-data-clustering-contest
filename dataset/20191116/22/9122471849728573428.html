      <h1>Scott Frost Reveals What Needs To Change For Nebraska Moving Forward</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:07:50+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Scott Frost and the Nebraska football program suffered another tough loss today. The Huskers were beaten by Wisconsin in Lincoln, dropping to 4-6 on the season.</p>
      <p>It was an eventful day for Frost, who received a two-year contract extension prior to kickoff. He’s now under contract through the 2026 season.</p>
      <p>Year 2 was supposed to feature a big step up for the Huskers, but that hasn’t happened. Adrian Martinez is far from the Heisman Trophy contender some projected him to be, the defense gives up an insane amount of big plays and mistakes are made by just about everyone.</p>
      <p>Nebraska remains committed to Frost, though, and that is probably the smart move. If anyone is going to turn this program around, it’ll probably be him.</p>
      <p>Frost was direct following the loss to Wisconsin. He knows what needs to change – get better players.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to keep bringing more talent into this program so that we are going into gun fights with fully loaded guns, and we’ve got some really good bullets on this team. We have some really good pieces, some really good weapons, but we need more,” Frost said, per Parker Gabriel.</p>

      <p>It’s definitely unfair to judge Frost until he’s been able to bring in multiple recruiting classes. Due to the early signing period, the first recruiting class is almost impossible to put together. The majority of recruits have already made final decisions by the time a coaching hire is made. So, Frost has really only had one full cycle. That’s not enough.</p>
      <p>Nebraska will need to improve in all areas moving forward, though, and that includes Frost. Everyone needs to be better for this to turn and it looks like Frost knows that. To get better players into the program, he’ll need to recruit better.</p>
      <p>For now, the Huskers will look to finish the season with two wins and make a bowl game.</p>
