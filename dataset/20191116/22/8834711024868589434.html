      <h1>Janat Stars As Afghanistan Upset West Indies To Level T20 Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:39:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>Karim Janat came in from the cold to take a starring role Saturday as Afghanistan beat West Indies by 41 runs to level their three-match Twenty20 series.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old was only a substitute in the first clash in Lucknow that West Indies easily won. But he took five wickets as West Indies were restricted to 106-8 in the chase for Afghanistan’s 147-7 in the second game.</p>
      <p>Janat’s 26 from 18 balls, including five fours, was also the joint-highest score for Afghanistan along with opener Hazratullah Zazai.</p>
      <p>“I was the 12th man for the last game and that was the best way for me to see what the line should be. I had a plan in mind and I kept to it,” said Janat, whose change of pace and skillful choice of length claimed valuable scalps including Evin Lewis and Shimron Hetmyer.</p>
      <p>“On this wicket, change of pace is a good weapon to have.”</p>
      <p>Afghanistan had looked on course for a bigger total but Kesrick Williams took two wickets in two balls to claim openers Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz after they put on 42.</p>
      <p>Some of Afghanistan’s mid-order wickets went cheaply and with dew making bowling difficult, West Indies captain Kieron Pollard must have thought his side’s unbeaten record in the tour so far was safe.</p>
      <p>But medium pace bowler Janat was well-supported by the other Afghan bowlers and the West Indies batsmen looked sluggish as they chased a run-rate that quickly got out of control.</p>
      <p>“At the halfway stage, we were happy with 147,” said Pollard. “Their batsmen came hard at us, but we came back well, especially Kesrick. We cannot fault the bowlers.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t get a good start in the powerplay, and we lost wickets every time we were trying to be aggressive.</p>
      <p>“We just have 24 hours to wrong the rights, and hopefully we can come back and do those things right tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>The final game is also in Lucknow, where Afghanistan play their home games, on Sunday. West Indies beat Afghanistan 3-0 in the one-day series before the T20s.</p>
