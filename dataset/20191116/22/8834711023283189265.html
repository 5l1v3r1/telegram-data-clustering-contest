      <h1>Lombard Recovers To Keep Nose In Front At Nedbank Challenge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:33:33+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>South Africa’s Zander Lombard recovered from a poor start to shoot a level-par 72 and retain the lead after the third round of the Nedbank Golf Challenge at the Gary Player Country Club on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lombard’s 11-under-par total of 205 kept him one shot ahead of fellow countryman Louis Oosthuizen (71) and Belgium’s Thomas Detry (69).</p>
      <p>On a day when sub-70 scores were a rarity, Oliver Wilson of England soared up the leaderboard with a five-under-par 67 to share fourth place on eight-under with Sweden’s Marcus Kinhult (70).</p>
      <p>Chasing a first prize of $2.5 million, Lombard saw his overnight two-shot lead disappear when he dropped three shots over the first eight holes, largely because of erratic tee shots on a demanding course.</p>
      <p>But birdies on successive par-fives at 10 and 11 started his fightback.</p>
      <p>Lombard, who lost his European Tour card in 2017 and had to survive qualifying school last year to regain his status, has yet to win on the tour.</p>
      <p>If he can close out the win it will almost treble the career earnings of a player ranked 234th in the world. A finish in the top eight will earn him a place in next week’s season-ending Tour championship in Dubai.</p>
      <p>Detry is also seeking a first win and for much of the round he maintained what he described as “stress-free” golf, in contrast to his rollercoaster second round when he suffered five penalty strokes in making 71.</p>
      <p>Successive birdies at 10 and 11 put Detry in a three-way tie with Lombard and Oosthuizen before a magnificent 190-yard iron shot from a fairway bunker set up a birdie at the 13th to put him in the lead on his own.</p>
      <p>At that stage he was the only player in the field not have dropped a shot during the round.</p>
      <p>But a pulled tee shot on the par-five 14th bounced off a cart path into thick bush and Detry was forced to play three off the tee for the third time in two days.</p>
      <p>He made a double-bogey seven, while both Lombard and Oosthuizen made birdies to be two ahead of the Belgian.</p>
      <p>Detry fought back with superb iron shots to birdie the next two holes before he drove into a fairway bunker on the 18th hole, leading to another dropped shot.</p>
      <p>Wilson said he was delighted with his round, which was bettered on the day only by Scottish rookie Robert MacIntyre, who shot 65 to climb into a tie for 21st place.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy,” said Wilson. “I had a few breaks but I played solid golf. I hit a lot of greens and kept it relatively stress-free.”</p>
      <p>Wilson’s breaks included a chip-in at 15 and a long birdie putt at 17 which looked set to miss narrowly on the right of the hole before deviating off a pitch mark and going in.</p>
      <p>Defending champion Lee Westwood had a solid round of 69 to move into a five-way tie for sixth place on 210. Also on six-under was Race to Dubai leader Bernd Wiesberger, who fired a 70.</p>
