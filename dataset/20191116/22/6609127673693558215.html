        <b>A LONG-LOST nephew of £58million lottery jackpot winner Fred Higgins claims his uncle is blanking his plea to find out what happened to his missing mum.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ian Cooke’s Scots mother Alexandrina — Fred’s eldest sister — disappeared in 1964 when he was aged six and he was later told she had died.</p>

      <p>But Ian, 61, uncovered evidence she might be alive during a probe into abuse he suffered as a child in a care home 50 years ago.</p>
      <p>Fred, 69, of Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, who scooped the gigantic EuroMillions prize with wife Lesley, 59, last August, has so far not stepped in to help him.</p>
      <p>Ian fears his uncle thinks he’s chasing a handout — but insists he only discovered his rich relative while looking into his family history.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m not a gold digger. I just want to know where my mum is. The truth is out there and they could help me.</p>
      <p>“My search predates their win and I can prove it. I also have compensation from the abuse I suffered so I don’t need their money.</p>
      <p>“My mum would be 83 — there’s a chance she could be alive so every second is important to me.”</p>

      <p>Records reveal Alexandrina was born out of wedlock with the surname Ingram to parents Isaac Higgins and Alexandrina Ingram in June 1936. Her parents wed in Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire in 1937.</p>
      <p>Her little brother Fred was born 14 years later in August 1950. And she has a further four younger Higgins siblings — Justin, Barbara Henry and John.</p>
      <p>Alexandrina moved to England before marrying husband Colin in Worksop, Notts, in December 1956. Ian was born two years later.</p>
      <p>But his mum fled the family home in 1964 and Ian claims he is aware she tried and failed to win custody of him two years later.</p>
      <p>Then in 1969, lorry driver Colin died aged 36 and Ian went into care at Aston Hall home in Derbyshire. He says he was assaulted and illegally drugged three times.</p>

      <p>When he joined the Navy in 1970 he was dealt another blow when the council told him his mother was dead.</p>
      <p>But a public inquiry into abuse at the care home placed a question mark over whether that was true — and unexpectedly uncovered Ian’s link to multi-millionaire Fred.</p>
      <p>Ian said: “As part of the inquiry my local MP John Mann requested my care records to find out why I had gone to Aston Hall.</p>
      <p>“My discharge notes said both my parents were dead. But on my second meeting with my MP he said ‘Ian do you realise your mother might not be dead?’”</p>
      <p>The pair realised Alexandrina had never officially been declared dead, as she was missing.</p>

      <p>And the search into his background threw up an unexpected twist in April.</p>
      <p>Ian continued: “John Mann set up a genealogy team, and they found out Fred Higgins was my uncle.</p>
      <p>“He tried to get hold of Fred but I had been looking before he won the lottery.” Disabled abuse survivor Ian, who is happy to be identified, does not know why his lost family won’t speak to him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I can’t understand why they aren’t interested in where their elder sister is. All I want to do is talk to one of the Higgins family — I’m not bothered which one. They have all blanked me.</p>
      <p>“I have even offered to sign a disclaimer saying I don’t want any money. Camelot have refused to give me a number for them.</p>

      <p>“Them winning the lottery is a nightmare for me. I just want to know my mum’s whereabouts or her grave so I can get closure.</p>
      <p>Baron Mann wrote to Fred after making contact with Camelot in May. But he has not heard anything back from the lottery winner.</p>
      <p>He said: “There’s no question on the authenticity of the case. My researchers looked at it in detail.</p>
      <p>“There is a possibility that she [Alexandrina] is alive, and the more likely possibility that she might have had other children who would be alive. This pre-dates the announcement of them winning the lottery considerably.”</p>
      <p>Baron Mann said he only discovered Ian was related to Fred in spring this year.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was gobsmacked. It was me who put it together. I thought we’ve made the big breakthrough, now we have this remarkable problem to overcome.</p>
      <p>“There’s no question about Mr Cooke’s motivations.</p>
      <p>“I’ve written to Mr Higgins and asked if he has any photos, or if he has information that would help us. Someone will know something that might help us. It’s highly unlikely people know absolutely nothing.”</p>
      <p>But the ex-Labour MP for Bassetlaw, who moved to the House of Lords last month, said he understands why Fred may be sceptical.</p>
      <p>He said: “If I’d won that amount of money I would be dubious of someone saying ‘I’m your long lost relative from 60 years ago’.”</p>
      <p>Baron Mann says there is no evidence Alexandrina is dead, despite documents showing the authorities thought she had passed away. One states Ian was taken into care in 1969 “when the one remaining parent had died”. A 1977 social services letter repeats the claim.</p>
      <p>Baron Mann said: “He was led to believe his mother is dead. It’s clear it wasn’t true. She just couldn’t be found.”</p>
      <p>We told in April how scammers are posing as Fred and Lesley Higgins to dupe victims by offering them a share of their jackpot.</p>
      <p>The couple, who claimed their mega win in August 2018, said they were “horrified”. And in March we told how they planned to set up a charitable trust to help others.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the lotto winner said that the Higgins family did not want to comment. Nottinghamshire County Council was approached for a comment but did not reply.</p>
