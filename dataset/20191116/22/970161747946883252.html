      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> isn’t adjusting to life <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/">in the </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/"> jungle very well</a>, and the series hasn’t even started yet.</p>
      <p>In fact, the EastEnders actress can be seen with her head in her hands as she attempts to take on the first challenge, walking on a shaky-looking plank on top of The Focus Building, in Australia.</p>
      <p>Well, to be fair to her, it is 334ft above the ground.</p>
      <p>It seems this year’s task is harder than ever, as the famous faces will have to walk the plank – suspended off the edge of the skyscraper, before having to climb down a ladder.</p>
      <p>And, even if they complete that part, they then have to hit a switch with their foot as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>To be fair, if we were Jacqueline, we would’ve been on the flight home before <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-and-dec/">Ant and Dec</a> completed the instructions.</p>

      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-will-be-first-star-to-quit-show-according-to-psychic-11167891/">a psychic has stated that Jac will be the first one to go home</a> – and could walk from the jungle before the first half of the season is complete.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline is going to find it really difficult being away from home, she’ll feel incredibly homesick,’ Chris Riley told Metro.co.uk.</p>

      <p>‘I’m seeing that she may try to walk out of the jungle in the first half of the series, hopefully the team’s morale and friendships will convince her to stay.’</p>
      <p>He also explained that he feels the mum-of-two will be an easy target for the bushtucker challenges, adding: ‘The public will vote both her and another female into many of the early trials, a result which will help Jacqueline’s personality to shine through.</p>
      <p>‘I’m seeing that Jacqueline has fears, as we all do, although some are quite strong, possibly leading her to experience a panic attack and subsequently pull out of her first or second trial.’</p>
      <p>Well, we won’t have long to find out…</p>
