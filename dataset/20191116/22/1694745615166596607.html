      <p>Roasting is a fool-proof method for making just about any veggie taste amazing, especially cauliflower, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/How-Roast-Vegetables-26479834">it may also be the easiest</a>. Chop your washed cauliflower into bite-sized pieces, then toss them in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and your favorite spices and salts. If you're feeling fancy you can include smashed garlic, fresh herbs, or even parmesan cheese. Transfer the cauliflower to a baking tray, then throw everything into an oven preheated at 450 degrees for prime caramelization. Roasted cauliflower is easy to make up as you go along, but if you're more comfortable following a recipe, there are <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Roasted-Turmeric-Cauliflower-Recipe-41803002">tons out there</a>.</p>

      <p>Steaming isn't necessarily the tastiest way to enjoy cauliflower, but it's an important skill to have in your pocket if you want to make more complex cauliflower-based dishes. Just boil about two inches of water in a large pot. Put your chopped cauliflower into either a steaming basket or a heat-proof colander, then slide the basket into the pot. Cover everything with a lid and let the steam cook the cauliflower for three to eight minutes, depending on your desired texture. It's easy to throw the steamed cauliflower into a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/healthy-food-processor-recipes-46801978">food processor</a> to use in dozens of recipes, but don't dismiss steamed cauliflower just yet — it's totally delicious as-is with a drizzle of butter, salt, and pepper.</p>

      <p>Put your roasting and steaming skills to the test by mashing your cooked cauliflower into a delicious purée. You can think of this method as a yummy <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Keto-Recipes-44130024">alternative to mashed potatoes</a> or simply your new favorite way to eat your veggies. Just throw your cooked cauliflower into a high-speed blender along with your favorite mashed potato additions like broth, butter, salt, milk, sour cream, or roasted garlic. Blend everything to your desired consistency and serve — you can even top it with bacon and cheese. Be sparing with your liquids at first, though, because cauliflower is much less starchy than your typical potato and might not need as much moisture.</p>
      <h3>4 How to Grill Cauliflower</h3>

      <p>The previous methods can result in the perfect side dish, but grilling your cauliflower into "steaks" can help it stand as <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Fast-Easy-Vegetarian-Dinners-37877107">a main course</a>. Chop off the leaves surrounding the cauliflower's stem and then cut off the end of the stem so that your cauliflower can balance on its base. The outermost sides of the cauliflower won't work for this method because the florets will fall apart, so cut them off (you can reserve them to be steamed or roasted). Then slice the remaining cauliflower into two or three "steaks." Be careful not to cut them too thick or else they might not cook evenly. Brush both sides of your steaks with a mixture of olive oil and your favorite seasonings, then place them on a grill at medium-high heat. Let each side cook for five minutes, or until charred and tender all the way through, and then feast.</p>
