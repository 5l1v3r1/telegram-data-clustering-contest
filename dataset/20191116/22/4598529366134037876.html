      <p>The House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry released transcripts Saturday of the closed-door testimonies earlier this month of outgoing National Security Council aide Tim Morrison and Vice President Mike Pence aide Jennifer Williams.Both Morrison and Williams raised their concerns about the now-infamous July call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was part of effort to dig up false allegations against Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/morrison-testimony-impeachment.html">the New York Times reported</a> that <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/morrison-quid-pro-quo-ukraine-funding">Morrison confirmed</a> in his testimony that there was a quid pro quo associated with Trump’s decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Last week, two sources familiar with <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/morrison-quid-pro-quo-ukraine-funding">Williams’ testimony</a> told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/politics/jennifer-williams-testimony/index.html">CNN</a> that she found the conversation between Trump and Zelensky to be out of the ordinary because it did not have the typical tone of a diplomatic call. Williams testified that she did not bring up her concerns regarding the call with her superiors.</p>
