      <h1>Santander Launching Ripple-Powered Payments in Six New Corridors, Banking Giant Not Utilizing XRP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:45:28+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Spanish banking giant Santander says it will soon expand its use of Ripple’s cross-border payments platform.</p>
      <p>In a recent conference held by the Institute of International and European Affairs, managing director of digital investment banking at Santander, John Whelan, talked about the company’s efforts in blockchain.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://youtu.be/-0lD_bGemms">says</a> the company will bring its Ripple-powered payments platform called One Pay FX to all 10 of its main corridors in the near future.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We actually have a blockchain-based international payments system that’s running on four of our corridors: Brazil, Mexico, UK, Spain. It’ll be on all 10 soon. Instant transfers at very, very tight spreads: 30 basis points.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>It’s a nice user experience. I use it myself. I sent money to the United States. It’s available same-day. Fantastic, and at a guaranteed rate.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>In April of this year, Santander executive chair Ana Botín <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/07/14/ripple-adoption-expands-as-banking-giant-santander-launches-new-payment-corridor/">said</a> One Pay FX is now powering more than half of Santander Group’s FX payments.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“With this new initiative that is already in place, we’re actually covering 50% of all the FX payments that the Santander Group does annually.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And it works really well, because the rails that we’re using – which, as you say, we’ve collaborated with Ripple – we’ve been testing those for two years, actually with our own employees. And it works.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>It’s safe. It’s fully compliant, and obviously we’ve made sure we comply with all local regulations. So you’re in safe hands.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>One Pay FX launched in October of 2018.</p>
      <p>It utilizes Ripple’s primary cross-border payment messaging system, which is designed to be a faster alternative to Swift. One Pay FX does not utilize On-Demand Liquidity, which is powered by XRP.</p>
      <p>Santander’s support desk set off a whirlwind of rumors back in March, when it mistakenly stated that it was using XRP.</p>
      <p>Santander then <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/03/24/wait-what-ripple-partner-santander-says-its-using-xrp-to-send-money-to-19-countries/">retracted</a> the statement and clarified it only uses Ripple’s xCurrent, which does not utilize the digital asset.</p>
