      <h1>Arsenal to offer Granit Xhaka to Monchengladbach in return for Denis Zakaria transfer</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka hasn't played for Arsenal since his public falling out with Gunners fans after he was substituted against Crystal Palace - and a January transfer looks likely</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Moxley, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-moxley/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal will offer Granit Xhaka as bait to land Borussia Monchengladbach’s midfield sensation Denis Zakaria.</p>
      <p>The Swiss has been in superb form for the German club who currently occupy top spot in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>They are fighting off interest from several of European football’s big-hitters for the 22-year-old.</p>
      <p>Xhaka is set to leave the Gunners in January after a public falling-out with the club which has seen him stripped of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Steve Bruce would take the Swiss international on Tyneside but a move back to the club where he made his name will appeal to the midfielder.</p>

      <p>Any deal would depend on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> having first refusal on Zakaria next summer if Monchengladbach decide to cash in.</p>
      <p>Xhaka appeared to take a pop at Gunners supporters on social media during the international break.</p>
      <p>A post on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> could be translated as: "Happiness is when you are satisfied with yourself and don't need the confirmation of others."</p>

      <p>Whatever happens in Xhaka's future, Gunners legend Patrick Vieira believes that he has been unfairly treated by fans and deserves more respect.</p>
      <p>"I feel sorry for him because he's going through a really different period and really difficult time at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> ," Vieira said. "But I think we have to remind ourselves that he's achieved a lot since he's (been) at Arsenal and he deserves a lot of respect.</p>
      <p>"When you're a player and don't perform the way you expect, you get frustrated about yourself. And sometimes you say things or do things you regret.</p>
      <p>"I find it really difficult a lot of ex-footballers have jumped on him and being really negative towards him - it's too too easy.</p>
      <p>"I know how good he is and he will come through this difficult period because he's a strong man, he's a good player. And he will show how good he is.''</p>
