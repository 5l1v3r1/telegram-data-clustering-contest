      <p>2019 has been a big year for Dave East. Not only did the Harlem, New York rapper finally drop the album that is being called his true debut, <i>Survival</i>, but he is also <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/07/wu-tang-clan-american-saga-trailer-video/">portraying Method Man (fka Shotgun) in the Hulu miniseries <i>Wu-Tang: An American Saga</i>.</a></p>
      <p>While promoting <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/555WY4PFhQaqYEO0r65kBn?si=y-WRUFo_TNKqFHmdjyVQwA"><i>Survival </i></a>(which features involvement from Nas, DJ Premier, and Fabolous), Dave stopped by <i>The L.A. Leakers</i> Show to kick a quick freestyle. Fittingly, DJ Sourmilk and Justin Credible give him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCouTpY5S0">Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s “Brooklyn Zoo”</a> instrumental (produced by True Master and O.D.B.) to get busy on. While he pauses and restarts a couple of times, the Dirt Gang MC spits some fire bars.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In his relaxed and confident tone, he flows, <i>“I’m all in for heist, federal note mission / Drink a lot of water, so I glow different / Mirror me back wasn’t no Instagram, it wasn’t no Snap’ / I got robbed, was down to die to get back / Still was writing these raps / I had a daughter, put my life to the back / Her’s in the front, I light a blunt, how I survived in the trap / Only God knows / This membership comes with barcodes / You trying to have a hot girl summer, f*ck it, my heart cold / Arm froze / My neck too / Sergio Tachini my sweatsuit / They noticed I’m special / No time to act cute / Mafia pull up in black suits / We ain’t flashing guns, these gats shoot / We ain’t flashing guns, these gats shoot.”</i></p>
      <p>Dave repeats various lines in the freestyle, similar to how O.D.B. repeats certain bars in “Brooklyn Zoo.”</p>
