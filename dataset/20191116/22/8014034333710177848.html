      <p>SAN DIEGO — The Latest on a shooting in San Diego (all times local):</p>
      <p>2:35 p.m.</p>
      <p>San Diego police believe the deaths of three young boys and their parents were the result of a domestic dispute involving a husband and wife who were apparently going through a divorce.</p>
      <p>Police Chief David Nisleit told a news conference Saturday afternoon that the couple had split up some time ago and that the 29-year-old mother had recently obtained a restraining order against the 31-year-old father. No names were disclosed.</p>
      <p>Police Lt. Matt Dobbs says officers were summoned to the home shortly before 7 a.m. Saturday by someone who made a 911 call from the residence.</p>
      <p>They arrived to see a boy inside the home covered in blood and found others severely wounded when they broke in.</p>
      <p>The man, woman and three of the children have died.</p>
      <p>Police say another young boy is hospitalized in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Authorities say all were the victims of gunshot wounds.</p>

      <p>This story has been updated to remove reference to the surviving child’s age after new information from authorities.</p>

      <p>Five members of a family, including three young boys, have died and another boy was hospitalized with injuries in an apparent murder-suicide in San Diego.</p>
      <p>Lt. Matt Dobbs said officers responded to a report of arguing and what sounded like a nail gun being fired inside a house in the Paradise Hills neighbourhood Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>He said when officers arrived, they found a 3-year-old boy, a 29-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man dead inside. A 5-year-old boy and 9-year-old boy were taken to the hospital where they were pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>An 11-year-old boy was also taken to the hospital to undergo surgery. His condition has not been released.</p>
      <p>Dobbs said investigators found a gun in the house. Police believe the shooter was one of the deceased.</p>
