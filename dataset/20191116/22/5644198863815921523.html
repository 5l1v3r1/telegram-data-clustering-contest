      <p>Familiarity has breed a healthy respect but Denmark are still setting out to win when they take on the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in a decisive Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday, midfielder Thomas Delaney said.</p>
      <p>COPENHAGEN: Familiarity has breed a healthy respect but Denmark are still setting out to win when they take on the Republic of Ireland in Dublin in a decisive Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday, midfielder Thomas Delaney said.</p>
      <p>Denmark need only draw the game at the Aviva Stadium to book their place at next year's European Championship and eliminate their hosts.</p>

      <p>It will be the sixth meeting in two years between the two countries, who have drawn four of them.</p>
      <p>The other was a startling 5-1 triumph for the Danes in Dublin almost two years to the day that ensured qualification for the World Cup in Russia.</p>
      <p>"We hate to play Ireland at the moment, we've played them so much recently," said the 28-year-old Borussia Dortmund midfielder Delaney, born in Denmark with American heritage and whose name would not took out of place in any Irish line-up.</p>
      <p>"We know each other well, and that goes both ways, so we don't have the upper hand in that regard.</p>
      <p>"I don't fear Ireland, but I have a great respect. I know it's going to be a difficult game. It's going to be a great atmosphere and Ireland are a team who play with their hearts on their sleeve.</p>
      <p>"It's cliche but it's going to be a war. They are going to bring everything."</p>
      <p>Denmark beat Gibraltar 6-0 in their penultimate qualifier in Copenhagen on Friday to leave them top of Group D and one point away from a Euro 2020 berth â€“ important for a country whose capital will be one of the tournament's host cities.</p>
      <p>"It's a big advantage for us that we only need a draw but it won't change our approach. We'll go into the game, wanting to win," Delaney added.</p>
      <p>"We don't want to be 0-0 with just 10 minutes against Ireland and facing massive pressure from them. That's not how we'd like the game to develop."</p>
      <p>TRIUMPH</p>
      <p>Confidence garnered from the 5-1 triumph will be a factor too, Delaney added.</p>
      <p>"I'm not saying it's going to be the same game but we know we can do it. And that will play a part," he said.</p>
      <p>He had previously described trying to break down Ireland's defence like "opening a tin of beans with your hands".</p>
      <p>On Monday, however, the Irish must attack, likely with a long ball approach over the midfield.</p>
      <p>"It's another kind of cliche in football that if you control the midfield you win the game and that's a big point for us. That's how we controlled the game when we won 5-1. We had the upper hand in the middle and were very sharp on counter attacks," the Dane said.</p>
      <p>"If we get the same game plan going I'll be happy although I'm not expecting it to be the same."</p>
