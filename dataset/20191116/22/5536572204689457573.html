      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is out for the season due to a dislocated hip with a posterior wall fracture suffered on Saturday versus Mississippi State.</p>

      <p>Bama was up 35-7 in the second quarter when Tagovailoa found himself being tackled to the turf after heaving a pass out-of-play, crashing to the turf on his surgically-repaired ankle, hip and nose.</p>
      <p>Trainers quickly sprinted to Tagovailoa, who was bleeding profusely from his nose and screaming in pain.</p>
      <p>“He hurt his hip and I don’t know anything else more than that,” Nick Saban said, who was clearly frustrated, to ESPN’s Molly McGrath coming off the field at halftime. “That was going to be his last series, we’re were going to do some 2-minute before the half with him, just for practice. We’ve got to block better and not get him sacked, but too bad. We were going to put Mac in, but wanted Tua to get some 2-minute practice.</p>
      <p>“I don’t worry about players getting hurt, but certainly don’t want to see anybody get hurt, especially him.”</p>
