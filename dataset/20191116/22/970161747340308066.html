      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has drawn up an eight-man list of long-term targets ahead of the January transfer window, reports say.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are expected to do business in January, with Solskjaer’s main priority appearing to be the signing of a striker.</p>
      <p>Mario Mandzukic has been heavily linked with a switch to Old Trafford and <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3990703/sources-manchester-united-to-make-enquiry-over-haaland-availability-in-january">ESPN</a> claim United have decided on a lengthy list of priority targets.</p>

      <p>Bournemouth striker <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/callum-wilson/">Callum Wilson</a>, Leicester playmaker <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-maddison/">James Maddison</a>, West Ham midfielder <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-rice/">Declan Rice</a>, Lyon striker <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/moussa-dembele/">Moussa Dembele</a> and Aston Villa duo John McGinn and Jack Grealish are also proprieties.</p>
      <p>United intend to chase these targets beyond the January window, but are prepared to spend in the winter window if their ‘key’ targets become available.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer is determined to build his United squad around talented youngsters who would predominately be British, just as Sir Alex Ferguson did when he was in charge at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>United want to significantly strengthen their midfield, as well as their forward line after the departures of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer was unable to replace Sanchez and Lukaku during the summer and the latter claimed this week the United boss wanted him to stay.</p>
      <p>‘Solskjaer has my eternal respect,’ Lukaku said.</p>
      <p>‘He understood me when I said in March that it was time for me to leave England.</p>
      <p>‘I have been in the Premier League as an 18-year-old boy and now I am 26. Solskjaer wanted to keep me, but I was ready for something new.’</p>
