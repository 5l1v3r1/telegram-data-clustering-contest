      <h1>Jim Harbaugh Reacts To Michigan’s Blowout Of Michigan State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:44:49+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Entering the season, one of the major issues plaguing Jim Harbaugh was his inability to beat rivals and top teams at Michigan. The season didn’t get off to the start that fans had hoped, with two losses early including a blowout defeat against Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Since the season’s second loss, a tight game at Penn State, Michigan has figured some things out. That includes those coveted rivalry victories that have eluded Harbaugh to this point.</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago, Michigan stomped No. 8 Notre Dame at home, 45-14. Today, Michigan State faced a similar fate, falling 44-10.</p>
      <p>The Spartans have really struggled this year, and hasn’t won since September. Still, any win against the Spartans is one that the Wolverines will take. Harbaugh wasn’t worried about rubbing it in either. He kept his starters in well into the fourth quarter, and <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/michigan-wolverines/michigan-michigan-state-jim-harbaugh-running-up-score-shea-patterson">had Shea Patterson throwing during Michigan’s last full drive</a>.</p>
      <p>Following the win, Harbaugh said that Michigan’s players had a lot of fun out there. Angelique Chengelis of <i>The Detroit News </i>posted video from Harbaugh’s press conference after the game:</p>

      <p>Jim Harbaugh stressed the importance of his players winning the Michigan “state championship.” The Wolverines struggled against MSU for a while, but have now captured three of the last four games in the series.</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s a big game, it’s for the state championship. 112th version and now our team, everybody that’s in the locker room has the advantage…it’s a big program win.”</blockquote>
      <p>This was Michigan’s 71st win in 112 editions of the game. The Wolverines now own a 39-27–2 edge since the game started being played for the Paul Bunyan Trophy, a few years after this game became a Big Ten rivalry.</p>
      <p>Michigan has a tricky game at Indiana next week, before the real test, No. 2 Ohio State to end the year.</p>
