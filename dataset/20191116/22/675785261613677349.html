      <h2>The Labour MP Jess Phillips was among viewers who reacted with horror to the Duke of York's choice of words in his interview with BBC Newsnight interview Emily Maitlis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:44:46+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>BBC viewers have reacted with disbelief to Prince Andrew's description of his paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein's behaviour as "unbecoming."</p>
      <p>Many who watched the broadcast reacted with shock to the Duke of York's choice of words in an exchange with BBC Newsnight interviewer Emily Maitlis tonight.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has faced questions over his judgement in maintaining a friendship with the disgraced billionaire, who was found dead by apparent suicide in his cell in New York in August.</p>
      <p>Epstein was awaiting trial over sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the prince was photographed walking with Epstein in New York's Central Park - two years after Epstein's earlier first conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution. </p>

      <p>The exchange arose as Prince Andrew described his relationship with Epstein and the financier's sometimes-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been accused of recruiting young women to have sex with the billionaire financier.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew can be heard to reflect to Maitlis during the interview that aired tonight on BBC Two: "On balance, could I have avoided ever meeting him?</p>
      <p>"Probably not and that’s because of my friendship with Ghislaine, it was…it was…it was inevitable that we would have come across each other.</p>
      <p>"Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes."</p>

      <p>Maitlis replies replies: "Unbecoming? He was a sex offender."</p>
      <p>The Prince responds: "Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender."</p>
      <p>Labour MP Jess Phillips was among those shocked by the Duke's comments, tweeting: "A manner unbecoming, he raped children!!!!"</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has come under additional scrutiny in accusations by Virginia Giuffre- formerly Virginia Roberts- that she had sex with him on three occasions when she was aged 17.</p>
      <p>In tonight's wide-ranging interview, the prince claimed he had never had sex with Ms Giuffre, and did not recall ever meeting her.</p>
      <p>He has questioned the validity of a photograph showing the pair pictured together with his arm looped around the teenager.</p>

      <p>He claimed he had been eating at Pizza Express with daughter Princess Beatrice on one night that Ms Giuffre claims she had sex with the prince when she was 17.</p>
      <p>He said he recalled the dinner at the pizza branch in Woking for a party "weirdly distinctly" as it was such a rare occurrence.</p>
      <p>When Maitlis asked the Prince about Giuffre’s allegations that he was sweating when they danced in Tramp nightclub, the Prince said it was impossible as he had  "peculiar medical condition.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply... it was almost impossible for me to sweat.”</p>
      <p>The Prince also told Maitlis he and Epstein were not as close friends as some had suggested, and told Maitlis his New York home was a "convenient place to stay."</p>
