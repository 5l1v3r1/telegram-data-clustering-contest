      <p>Having kids is a life sentence and we’re failing miserably to raise them properly.</p>
      <p>If parents don’t take responsibility for their children’s behaviour, who will? The State is failing at controlling anti-social behaviour and the Garda are living in fear of teenage gangs.</p>
      <p>Parents sit back and turn a blind eye because they’re not clued in to the shocking reality that this generation is running riot.</p>
      <p>If youngsters act out in public, parents should be punished. The recent bout of Halloween attacks is one example of how we’ve lost the power to control our youth.</p>
      <p>There’s talk of a dedicated transport police unit after the spate of violence on buses across the country.</p>
      <p>It was carried out by young people and the rhetoric and the tone of the attacks, to my mind, is a direct result of over exposure to violent porn.</p>
      <p>A female bus driver in Carriagline, Co Cork, was threatened with rape and had to lock herself in the cab of her bus as youths kicked the door.</p>

      <p>She had simply asked the teenagers for their fares and in response they threatened her.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fail’s Willie O’Dea believes parents should pay the price for their children’s anti-social behaviour. In a recent interview he said they have a huge role to stop such disgraceful acts.</p>
      <p>I agree. If parents were slapped with a fine every time their precious offspring behaved in a vile way, you can bet we’d have less anti-social problems.</p>
      <p>We’ve gone PC mad and often don’t even know where our kids are. Therein lies the problem.</p>
      <p>We’ve become too soft, too afraid to damage our children’s confidence, too afraid to say “boo”. Meanwhile, they’re turning into selfish thugs and bullies. We all work too much and placate them with pocket money rather than tough love.</p>
      <p>What we don’t realise is when our children are on their phones and other devices, they’re living in a virtual world where organised crime is gaining momentum.</p>
      <p>Just look at the recent furore in Cork this month where armed gardai and the riot squad were deployed after reports surfaced that a number of shops were about to be robbed or attacked by a group of teens.</p>
      <p>The riot squad patrolled the streets of Cork city centre amid fears that a gang was about to go on the rampage.</p>
      <p>Last Friday evening the mob of up to 100 teenagers with their faces covered were seen running along St Patrick’s Street.</p>

        <figcaption>A large gang raided a store in Cork</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Police feared the gang would storm a number of high-street stores after an anonymous teenager posted a message on Twitter rallying the troops.</p>
      <p>The post was entitled, JD Cork City Robbery and called for the mob to gather at 5.30pm at McDonald’s restaurant on Daunt’s Square.</p>
      <p>The message read: “Dress Code. You must wear all black with bally (balaclava) and gloves. You only have one minute to yam that shop. This is at your own risk. Don’t come if you can’t run.”</p>
      <p>You’d think you were watching a Hollywood horror movie, but in this new dawn the internet is <br/>fuelling gang mentality and filling our kids’ heads with deranged ways to wreak havoc.</p>
      <p>Where were the parents? Why was there no intervention by the families of these hooligans?</p>
      <p>Presumably because the clueless parents were none the wiser to the premeditated plans of the social media generation.</p>
      <p>With the advent of Twitter and the vast nature of cyberspace we’re failing as parents to get with the programme.</p>
      <p>We’d rather use screens as a babysitter or entertainer than using them for surveillance or limiting our kids’ exposure.</p>
      <p>If we don’t catch up we’ll be left behind and our kids will be swallowed up by the dark web.</p>
      <p>While you’re tucking into your takeaway and rom-com on a Friday night, Little Johnny could be upstairs on a social-media platform engaging in pre-planned raids or setting up the next mob.</p>
      <p>Parents need to be held accountable for raising their kids the right way from a young age. Some experts now say bullying can start as young as three years old.</p>
      <p>Many of the teens involved in such mobs may well have been bullied into being part of the gang just to fit in.</p>

      <p>Change.org, the petition website operated by for-profit Change.org, Inc has over 240 million users and hosts sponsored campaigns for organisations.</p>
      <p>It recently campaigned to have parents of bullies fined. The petition stated they should be held accountable if their child is a bully and advised that sanctions had to be put in place to protect other children’s sense of wellbeing.</p>
      <p>It’s not acceptable for a child to hurt another and it’s the parents’ responsibility to teach their kids not to bully others.</p>
      <p>If we teach our children values from a young age, they’re less likely to turn into thugs.</p>
      <p>We’ve lost our moral consciousness and our lack of parenting is evident as teenagers run riot.</p>
      <p>The claws of the internet grips them and powerless parents are left paralysed.</p>
