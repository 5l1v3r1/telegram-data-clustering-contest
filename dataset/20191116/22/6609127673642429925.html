        <b>BORNA BARISIC has revealed he almost quit Rangers last season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Croatian defender arrived at <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> for £2million in the summer of 2018 from Osijek in his homeland.</p>

      <p>A combination of injuries and a loss of form saw the 27-year-old feature in just 22 of a possible 55 games for Steven Gerrard’s men in the last campaign.</p>
      <p>The left-back is honest enough to say he wasn’t mentally strong enough to handle the expectation levels at Ibrox and he was left wondering if he had made the wrong move coming to Scotland.</p>
      <p>However, after putting himself through a gruelling summer regime, Barisic has returned to form in style and is now gaffer Gerrard’s first choice ahead of Jon Flanagan and Andy Halliday.</p>
      <p>Barisic admits he had some dark days but it has made him appreciate the highs, like reaching the Betfred Cup final and hopefully Europa League group stages even more.</p>

      <p>He said: “To be honest, I did think about leaving Rangers. It was the second half of last season around February, March.</p>
      <p>“It was a hard time for me. I had a few injuries and I couldn’t really settle down.</p>
      <p>“That is normal when you keep getting injuries, you start to think maybe it is too much.</p>
      <p>“When you play for Rangers it isn’t just about your physicality, the mental side is really important too.</p>
      <p>“I came from the Croatian league and it is completely different there.</p>
      <p>“My mindset was different back then as well and I now feel I have the mentality that is needed to be a Rangers player.</p>

      <p>“To be a player here, you have to have that mentality to win every single game.</p>
      <p>“You can’t be happy because the team have won three, four or five games.</p>
      <p>“Here you have to win ALL the time. You have to be brave and get the team to the top of Scottish football — that’s what we want to do.</p>
      <p>“In the summer, I thought of everything and I decided I wanted to come back and be a success at Rangers.</p>
      <p>“I knew I needed to train when I was on holiday to make sure I was fit and ready to go this season. I scored against St Mirren and it was a great goal and it gave me a lift but after that I had a chat with the manager and we were honest with each other.</p>
      <p>“I won’t say what we spoke about, but I felt better after it.</p>
      <p>“I feel the squad is mentally stronger this season than last year.</p>
      <p>“We have all lifted up our levels in terms of confidence and mentality.</p>
      <p>“The pressure is massive at this club, and you have to deal with that.</p>
      <p>“Now I don’t feel pressure, I just feel confident in myself and the team.”</p>
      <p>Barisic has been an integral part of the Ibrox side’s success in recent months, which has seen them win 13 of 17 matches in all competitions since the victory in Paisley back in August.</p>
      <p>Gerrard’s side defeated Porto, who made the Champions League quarter-finals last season, 2-0 at home to sit joint top of Group G earlier this month.</p>
      <p>On the same night Rangers beat the Portuguese outfit, Celtic were getting the better of Lazio in Italy to book a last-32 spot with two games to spare.</p>
      <p>Barisic believes that Gerrard’s men can join their Old Firm rivals among the elite, but he believes both results will finally see Scottish clubs getting the respect they deserve.</p>
      <p>He added: “We are in a good position in the group.</p>
      <p>“Porto are a good team who were in the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season, so it was an amazing result.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like to get carried away about qualifying for the next round, but if we play like we have in Europe this season then we believe we can go through.</p>
      <p>“When we play some teams in Europe it is like they don’t have a lot of respect for us but I think we have shown this year that we are a good team and in the future they will have to respect us.</p>
      <p>“When you see how we played against Porto over the last two matches then teams may treat us differently now.</p>
      <p>“I think people will see the Scottish league as strong this year because of what the clubs have achieved in Europe.</p>
      <p>“It is good if Celtic play well and we play well. It lifts the whole league.”</p>
