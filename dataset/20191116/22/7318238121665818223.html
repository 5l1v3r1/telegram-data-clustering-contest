      <h1>Spain's top women footballers go on strike over pay dispute</h1>

      <p>Spain's top women football players went on strike on Saturday in a dispute over working conditions and minimum wage.</p>
      <p>The two-day strike action resulted in the cancellation of <a href="https://www.afe-futbol.com/web/noticia-detalle/primera-e-historica-huelga-en-el-futbol-femenino-espanol">eight matches</a> scheduled to take place over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Just under 200 players from 16 different clubs in the country's Women's First Division <a href="https://www.afe-futbol.com/web/noticia-detalle/4093">voted in October</a> to go on strike after negotiations between the different bodies collapsed.</p>
      <p>Players are demanding that <a href="https://www.afe-futbol.com/web/noticia-detalle/4118">the annual minimum wage</a> for full-time contracts be increased to €16,000 while that of part-time contracts be boosted to €12,000. They are also calling for a maternity package and paid holidays.</p>
      <p>The Association of Women's Football Clubs (ACFF) argues however that smaller clubs could not afford to increase the minimum salary from the current €8,000 per year.</p>
      <p>The UD Granadilla Tenerife club, whose team was meant to clash with RCD Espanyol on Saturday, said in <a href="http://udgtenerife.com/la-udg-tenerife-no-se-desplaza-a-la-ciudad-deportiva-dani-jarque/">a statement</a> that they "respect the position of the players to support the strike."</p>
      <p>"Staff, technical body and management wish that a fruitful and positive agreement will soon be reached between all the parties involved, for the sake of women's football and generations to come," it added.</p>
