      <h1>Virgil van Dijk explains why Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's criticism makes him better</h1>
      <h2>Virgil van Dijk recently took a break from concentrating on Liverpool's Premier League crunch clash with Man City to have dinner with Dutch monarch King Willem-Alexander</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool fans claim Virgil van Dijk is already football ­royalty – but the Dutch defender felt like the real deal when he was invited to dinner by the king of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk, the £75million centre-back who is the bookmakers’ ­favourite to win the Ballon d’Or on December 2, was flown to ­Amsterdam at the request of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The annual VIP event celebrates ‘outstanding’ Dutch people, and was attended by elite scientists, musicians, business people, ­authors – and one very special footballer.</p>
      <p>It says much about Van Dijk’s growing profile that he held court for much of the evening after his king asked for the low-down on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s Champions League coronation and their march to the top of the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Van Dijk said: “I sat next to the King for the most part, until after the main course.</p>
      <p>“We talked about a variety of subjects – but definitely about football!</p>
      <p>“As soon as I received the ­invitation I asked Liverpool if I could attend the event.</p>
      <p>“It came at a very awkward ­moment as it was in between our Champions League game against Genk and our match against ­ <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> !</p>
      <p>“Fortunately Pepijn Lijnders [Liverpool’s assistant manager] put a good word in for me.</p>
      <p>“As a Dutchman, Pep knew that this was something huge. It was a really special experience.”</p>

      <p>Van Dijk boarded a private jet to fly him back to Merseyside as soon as the event was finished.</p>
      <p>And he hinted that the first thing Kop boss Jurgen Klopp did on his return to Melwood was to keep him humble.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk said: “I have a very similar connection with Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool as I had earlier with Ronald Koeman at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> and I still have with Koeman with the national team.</p>
      <p>“Like Koeman, Klopp knows ­exactly how to get the best out of me – by being critical. When the media are hyping me and being very positive, he will downplay the praise all that – often with a wink.</p>
      <p>“When I was voted UEFA Player of the Year recently and had to go to the awards ceremony, Jurgen told all the lads at Liverpool that I was picking up the trophy on ­behalf of the entire team.</p>

      <p>“All the boys in the squad know I can take that sort of stuff very well.</p>
      <p>“I know what he means. At the same time, the boss gives me a lot of respect and responsibility.”</p>
      <p>Van Dijk’s royal visit had no ­effect on his performance as the Reds beat City 3-1 to go eight points clear at the top of the ­Premier League.</p>
      <p>But the Dutchman insists that all title talk has been banned from the Anfield dressing room.</p>
      <p>He said: “Of course I can sense how much winning the title is ­spoken about.</p>
      <p>“For our fans, winning the championship has been way too long, so they place the Premier League title now above everything.</p>
      <p>“No competition is more ­important than this one, but we need to keep the fever outside.</p>
      <p>“Klopp tells us every week, ‘Focus on the next match’.</p>
      <p>“We are doing alright, but it is only November.</p>
      <p>“The hardest months of football are still waiting.”</p>
