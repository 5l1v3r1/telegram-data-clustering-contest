      <h1>Street-Legal McLaren P1 GTR Looking For New Owner</h1>
      <h2>Only 58 McLaren P1 GTR track cars were made, but some of them were converted for the road.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>Before the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mclaren/speedtail">Speedtail</a>, the P1 was McLaren's flagship Ultimate Series car and was part of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/the-entire-holy-trinity-will-cost-you-an-outrageous-9-2-million">hybrid hypercar holy trinity</a> along with the Ferrari LaFerrari and Porsche 918 Spyder. While the road-going <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mclaren/p1">P1 </a>was one of the fastest production cars of its time, McLaren built an <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/the-mclaren-p1-gtr-shows-us-why-every-other-car-pales-in-comparison">even more extreme GTR version</a>.</p>
      <p>The downside? Production was limited to just 58 examples and they could only be tamed on the track. However, some of these were made <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/a-street-legal-mclaren-p1-gtr-for-4-36-million-is-a-steal">street legal by Lanzante Motorsport</a> – and one of them is currently looking for a new owner.</p>

      <p>Listed for sale by McLaren London via <a href="https://www.jardinemotors.co.uk/mclaren/used-cars/10444170-mc-laren-p1-gtr-vat-qualifying-with-lanzante-road-legal-conversion/">Jardine Motors</a>, this particular McLaren P1 GTR is chassis number 18 and is the 28th example that was converted for road use. It's also finished in Satin Carbon Black with red accents. Remarkably, it only has 179 miles on the clock.</p>
      <p>Compared to the road car, the P1 GTR is 110 pounds lighter and features improved levels of downforce thanks to its large fixed rear wing that features a Formula 1-style drag reduction system, making it the ultimate track car. To make it road legal, Lanzante fitted the P1 GTR with a handbrake, turn signals, catalytic converters to meet emission regulations, street-legal tires, and it also increased the ride height.</p>

      <p>Whereas the road-legal version of McLaren P1 delivers a combined 903 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque from a 3.8-liter, twin-turbo V8 engine and electric motor, the P1 GTR increases the output to a monumental 986 horsepower. With this setup, 0-62 mph takes less than 2.8 seconds before the P1 GTR hits a top speed of 225 mph. Unsurprisingly, the supercar's modifications and rarity come at a cost. If you want to drive away this road-legal P1 GTR, McLaren London is charging £3,000,000 ($3.8 million) – that's around $2.7 million more than the McLaren Senna and $1.5 million more than the McLaren Speedtail.</p>
