      <h1>Does Pep Guardiola have Man City contract escape clause? Mystery surrounds manager's deal</h1>
      <h2>There are increasing reports that Guardiola could quit Man City at the end of this season - although he has never walked out of a contract in his life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>It cost <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> more than £6million to keep their plan to make <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> their manager a secret.</p>
      <p>Only time will tell whether the Premier League champions have hatched a similar plot to ensure the Catalan’s possible departure from the club remains under wraps.</p>
      <p>Rumours are growing that Guardiola’s fourth season at the Etihad will be his last. The 48-year-old has a deal with City that runs until the summer of 2021.</p>
      <p>And he has NEVER walked out of a contract in his life. Guardiola signed a two-year extension in May 2018 after he became the first manager in the history English football to post a 100-point season.</p>
      <p>He was adamant that the details of the deal should be kept secret. A conservative estimate is that it is worth a cool £20million-a-year – before bonuses.</p>

      <p>What isn’t known is whether the agreement contains the same break clause that was alleged to have been in Manuel Pellegrini’s deal that enabled City to ease him out of the Etihad for Guardiola in the summer of 2016.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini, now boss of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , signed a two-year extension with City in August 2015 – when talk was rife that he was being replaced by the ­former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> coach at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The contract was reportedly ­designed to help Pellegrini work ­without the pressure of constant ­speculation that he was a dead man walking. The agreement allegedly contained a get-out clause which, it was claimed, could have been triggered by either party.</p>

      <p>Pellegrini was made aware of the club’s desire to eventually land Guardiola after they missed out on him when he decided to go to Bayern Munich after a 12-month sabbatical from football in 2013.</p>
      <p>And when the Chilean announced in February 2016 that he would be leaving City at the end of the season to be replaced by Guardiola, his reward was a reported £5million kiss-off.</p>
      <p>Assistant Ruben Cousillas and fitness coach Jose Cabello were also paid compensation packages, while first-team coach Brain Kidd and keeper coach Xabier Mancisidor accepted offers to take up roles on Guardiola’s backroom staff.</p>
      <p>The question is whether Guardiola’s deal offers him an escape route. When he signed a new deal in 2018, the expectation was that it would be for only one season. The two-year extension meant his reign in Manchester would be longer than at his previous clubs.</p>

      <p>When Sunday Mirror Sport revealed in September that Guardiola’s wife, Cristina, had returned to live in Catalonia with their youngest daughter, City insisted that she had gone to look after her fashion business and that it would not affect their manager’s commitment to his contract.</p>
      <p>But reports in Germany last week claimed the Guardiola family is not happy living in Manchester and that Bayern want him to return to Munich. It is unlikely Guardiola would return to a club which he guided to a hat-trick of Bundesliga titles.</p>
      <p>But he did give a first tantalising hint that this season could be his last back in April.</p>
      <p>City were preparing to face <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in a game they needed to win to keep ahead of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the most exciting Premier League race ever. When Guardiola was asked about his opinion of 72-year-old Palace boss Roy Hodgson and his own retirement plans, his answer was ambiguous.</p>

      <p>He said: “I don’t have plans. Usually life decides what you want to do. I am just living, having fun, preparing for games, NEXT season – and then after that we will see.”</p>
      <p>City officials insisted at the time that Guardiola’s words should not be ­literally interpreted that he could be gone in the summer of 2020. The club were unhappy with speculation in Italy a few months ago that their manager was heading for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> .</p>
      <p>Another gruelling battle with Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool at the top of the Premier League looks to be going the way of the Merseysiders after they opened up a nine-point lead over the champions with a 3-1 win at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Guardiola bristles at any suggestion that a feud with Jose Mourinho prompted him to quit Barcelona in 2012 and insists that he was drained by energy-sapping Nou Camp politics.</p>
      <p>There were similar boardroom pressures at Bayern. At City, he works hand-in-hand with two of his closest friends – chief executive Ferran Soriano and chief executive Txiki Begiristain – and has a level of control he was not granted at either of his former clubs.</p>
      <p>But City’s long-term strategy means they are already planning for life without Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Assistant boss Mikel Arteta has done an impressive job since replacing Guardiola’s right-hand man Domenec Torrent when the Spaniard took over at sister club New York City in 2018.</p>
      <p>Torrent is being touted for a possible return to the Etihad after leaving New York last week. And City are now in talks with Giovanni van Bronckhorst about taking over at the MLS club.</p>
