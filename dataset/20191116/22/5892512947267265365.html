      <h1>Report: Jon Jones vs. Dominick Reyes targeted for UFC 247 this February</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:14:03+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:14</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>Reigning UFC light heavyweight champion and pound-for-pound great Jon Jones is expected to defend his 205-pound title against undefeated contender Dominick Reyes at UFC 247, per <a href="https://twitter.com/CTaylor_96/status/1195809400474071040">BJPenn.com’s Chris Taylor</a>.</p>
      <p>While Jones and Reyes have verbally agreed to meet on Feb. 8 from inside Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, no contracts have been signed and UFC officials have yet to make an announcement.</p>
      <p>This news doesn’t necessarily come out of left field as <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/10/20958117/jon-jones-blasts-dominick-reyes-now-youre-going-to-show-this-fake-ass-respect">Jones and Reyes have been engaging with one another on social media</a> for the past month. Surging light heavyweight contender Corey Anderson, who is coming off a blistering first-round TKO finish over Johnny Walker at UFC 244 (see it <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/ufc-244-results-stream-fight-card-start-time-date-predictions-odds-highlights-masvidal-diaz-mma/2019/11/2/20942903/ufc-244-full-fight-video-highlights-diaz-masvidal-espn-bmf-mma-ppv-results-anderson-knockout-walker">HERE</a>), has attempted to spoil Jones and Reyes’ plans, but <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/3/20946965/dana-white-was-not-impressed-with-corey-andersons-crybaby-bulls-t-during-ufc-244-fight-week">UFC doesn’t seem interested in an “Overtime” title fight</a>.</p>
      <p>Jones, 32, is widely considered the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world and for good reason. The reigning UFC light heavyweight king has never actually lost a fight inside of the Octagon and seems to have an edge over every single opponent he faces. Jones did show signs of mortality in his most recent championship fight opposite Brazilian knockout artist Thiago Santos, but “Bones” still broke “Marreta” down to claim his 10th-career UFC title defense.</p>
      <p>Reyes, 29, has dominated the competition since his UFC arrival back in 2017. With a total Octagon record of 6-0, including a recent first-round knockout finish over former UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman (see it <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/19/20918670/ufc-boston-full-fight-video-highlights-weidman-reyes-mma-espn-results-hardy-rodriguez-knockout">HERE</a>), Reyes has certainly earned his shot at the 205-pound crown. The fact that he has the size and power to match up to “Bones” adds even more intrigue to this early-2020 title fight.</p>
