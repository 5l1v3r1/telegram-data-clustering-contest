      <p>In order to understand the various issues being faced by Goods and Services Tax (GST) taxpayers while filing their tax returns, Finance Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nirmala-sitharaman/">Nirmala Sitharaman</a> on Saturday held a meeting with chartered accountants, tax practitioners, traders and other stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Taxpayers are finding making amendments to their GST returns as the most challenging task, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said after the meeting, adding that a similar exercise would be undertaken by indirect tax commissioners at the circle level on December 7.</p>

        <b>EXPLAINED</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Will help in smooth roll-out of new returns system</h3>
      <p>After the recent extension given for filling GST annual returns for 2017-18 and 2018-19, the Finance Ministry reached out to stakeholders to understand and resolve the pending issues being faced in filing the returns. Technical glitches were one of the main issues faced by taxpayers when the new indirect tax regime was rolled out in July 2017. With the new GST returns proposed to be rolled out from April 1 next year, hearing out and resolving taxpayers’ issues and a constant exchange between the CBIC and the GSTN will help in improving compliance and preparing for a smoother roll-out of the new returns system.</p>

      <p>Each group of tax practitioners and other stakeholders filed different returns ( GSTR 3B, 1 and 9 among others) to demonstrate the shortcomings before the Finance Minister on a real-time basis. “By and large, straightforward return-filing was smooth and the problem areas pertained to making changes and amendments to the returns filed earlier and issue of credit/debit notes,” Pandey said. He added that some suggestions on introducing new functionalities would be considered.</p>
      <p>Indirect tax commissioners have been asked to conduct similar exercise at the circle level next month, Pandey said. “They will invite assessees along with their accountants and file returns, both old and proposed, before the official. Any issues that arise can be dealt with at the spot,” he said.</p>
      <p>The new simplified return formats will be implemented from April 1 next year. The taxpayers can upload their invoices while the system prepares a return for them under the new system. New GST return is available on the portal for trial and consultations will be held all across the country on December 7 to get feedback on the new system, he said, adding about 85,000 returns on voluntary basis have been filed so far although the new form becomes mandatory from April 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>Further, Pandey said that it was also decided that the indirect tax department and GST Network will meet regularly to thrash out issues. “The system is by and large robust as over 70 lakh people are filing returns every month. However, various previously unseen scenarios do occur when 1.2 crore taxpayers file returns,” Pandey said.</p>
      <p>He added that some of the issues are related to taxpayers not knowing the existence of a functionality in the system, while some other problems occur because of manual errors. Some of the suggestions were with regard to change or amendment to entries in the filing, credit and debit note, he said.  “This meeting was fruitful. In some cases they were not aware of the existing instructions, in some cases they pointed out to confusion and some suggestions with regard to further easing were made,” he said, adding that some clarificatory circular would be issued wherever required and other suggestions would be implemented.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the government had to extend the deadline for filing annual returns for GST for both FY18 and FY19 as various representations were received regarding challenges faced by taxpayers in filing of GSTR-9 and GSTR-9C. The FY18 annual returns had already seen at least four previous extensions.</p>
