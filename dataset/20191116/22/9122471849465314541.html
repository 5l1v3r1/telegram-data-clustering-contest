      <p>Not only is P.J. Fleck building something special at Minnesota, he’s teaching his players how to conduct themselves on and off the field. Despite trailing by double digits at the end of the first quarter, the Golden Gophers joined in on the Hawkeyes’ tradition called ‘The Wave.’</p>
      <p>After the first quarter comes to an end during every home game, Iowa fans wave to children in the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital.</p>
      <p>It’s truly one of the most heartwarming tradition in all of sports.</p>
      <p>This time around, the Hawkeyes weren’t the only team that waved toward the hospital.</p>
      <p>The Golden Gophers went to midfield so they could get a clear shot of the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital.</p>
      <p>Here’s the photo of Minnesota’s team waving to the children:</p>

      <p>Well done, Golden Gophers.</p>
      <p>Regardless of what happens in this game, it’s pretty clear that Fleck has taught his players the right way.</p>

      <p>Minnesota could have focused on drawing up a play for the start of the second quarter, but instead the team showed how humble and compassionate they can be.</p>
      <p>As for the actual game, Iowa leads 13-3 over Minnesota in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Fans can watch this game on FOX.</p>
