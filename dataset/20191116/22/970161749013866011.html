        <b>This is the moment that Jonny Baxter (Ray Quinn) has a final showdown with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) as the far right nightmare comes to an end in Hollyoaks. Viewers were on the edge of their seats when Stuart (Chris Simmons) kidnapped Ste and Sami (Rishi Nair) and took them to the edge of a cliff to kill them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Ste hit racist Stuart and Jonny with some home truths about their way of life and their depraved bigotry, Stuart was horrified when his own son Sid (Billy Price) alerted the police and then begged him to stop. Branding him a traitor, Stuart launched himself at Ste, who was on the edge of the killer drop.</p>

      <p>Sid intervened and pushed his father away, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/hollyoaks-spoilers-billy-price-promises-journey-for-sid-sumner-after-he-kills-dad-stuart-in-far-right-climax-11162990/">causing him to fall to his death and Jonny was arrested for his part in the crimes</a>. In order to find closure and to try and see if he can get through to Jonny one last time, Ste will visit him in prison for a final showdown.</p>

      <p>A bitter Jonny is disgusted to see him and accuses Ste of ruining his life, adding that Stuart was the only one who cared about him. Ste will attempt to convince Jonny that he too was groomed by Stuart but will Jonny see the light or has too much happened?</p>

      <p>As the pair have a final conversation, Ste will need some space to get his head together after everything that has happened. Kieron is taking a break from the role to act in a stage show Bands Of Gold but he will eventually return.</p>

      <p>As for Jonny, it looks like a more final goodbye as he is locked up for the racist crimes and attempted murder that came with planting the bomb which left Yasmine Maalik (Haiesha Mistry) deaf.</p>
