      <h1>Breaking: Tua Tagovailoa Is Reportedly Out For The Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:05:02+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Alabama entered the 2019 college football season as one of the favorites to win the national title.</p>
      <p>However, the Crimson Tide’s chance at a national title has taken two major hits in the last two weeks. Nick Saban and company lost their first game of the season against LSU last weekend.</p>
      <p>With an opportunity at redemption this weekend against Mississippi State, disaster struck once again.</p>
      <p>Alabama held a 35-7 lead late in the first half when star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa left the game with a hip injury. He left the game on a cart and was transported by <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/tua-tagovailoa-hospital-in-a-helicopter">helicopter to a hospita</a>l in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>After the game, Nick Saban said it could be a potentially serious injury.</p>
      <p>He was right.</p>
      <p>According to a report from Aaron Suttles, Tua is done for the season after he suffered a dislocated hip.</p>
      <p>“Tua Tagovailoa is out for the season with a dislocated hip with a posterior wall fracture, a person with knowledge of the situation tells me,” Suttles reported.</p>

      <p>It’s a heartbreaking diagnosis for the star quarterback.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa completed 14-of-18 passing for 256 yards and two touchdowns in the first half before he left the game. Alabama will turn to backup quarterback Mac Jones for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>Now all eyes are on Tua’s recovery. Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
