        <b>RADIO One star Arielle Free revealed 15 minutes of an interview she did with Lewis Capaldi went down the pan — as the pair started joking about poo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Stirling-born DJ grilled Someone You Loved singer Lewis, 23, for her Weekend Early Breakfast Show.</p>

      <p>But the Scots pair’s toilet banter proved too mucky for station bosses and the segment had to be censored.</p>
      <p>Arielle, 31, said: “We did this interview and they had to cut out 15 minutes of it because it was pure filth.</p>
      <p>“We talked about poos and jobbies. I introduced Lewis to the term ‘thunderjobby’ and he couldn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>“I feel I’ve done something really good in my life because I’ve educated Lewis Capaldi on what a thunderjobby is.</p>
      <p>“My mum’s going to be like, ‘I can’t believe you talked about jobbies’.”</p>
      <p>London-based Arielle regularly returns to Scotland for DJ dates and will perform at Edinburgh’s Hogmanay street party.</p>
      <p>She’s also working on a secret BBC Scotland show about romance, hot on the heels of her role co-hosting the Love Island: The Morning After podcast with former winner Kem Cetinay, 23.</p>
      <p>Arielle also told how her Scots roots are going down a treat with her new colleagues at Radio One — as she’s turned them on to the joys of tattie scones.</p>
      <p>She said: “I fill my suitcase with them every time I’m home — it’s become a thing at the station and I have orders from people to bring them back.</p>
      <p>And she added: “Aside from tattie scones I miss my family. Every time I come back my grandpa picks me up from the airport.</p>
      <p>“We go for a wee scran and I get to catch up with my niece.”</p>
      <p>Trained ballerina Arielle said she still can’t believe her luck after landing the Radio One gig in September.</p>
      <p>She said: “I pinch myself every time I walk into that building. Every day I’m waiting for it all to go Pete Tong.”</p>
