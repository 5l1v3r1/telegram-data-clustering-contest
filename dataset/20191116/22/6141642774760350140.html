      <p>Jack Singleton was shocked to find out Saracens are facing a 35-point deduction and a fine of over £5million but is itching to help his new team keep silencing their critics.</p>
      <p>The England international moved back to Allianz Park this summer after spending the last few seasons with rival Gallagher Premiership side Worcester.</p>
      <p>He only got to link up with his new team-mates last week, after being with England at the World Cup in Japan.</p>

      <p>The former Sarries academy player got to make his debut in the victory at Gloucester on Sunday and is determined to help them be successful again after they won the Premiership and Heineken Champions Cup last season.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit of a shock, but after the World Cup, where I didn’t play much, I was itching to get back and start playing and fit in with a new team. It didn’t really bother me massively, I just wanted to focus on the (Gloucester) game and ripping in with the squad,” Singleton said.</p>
      <p>“The record of the club speaks for itself with the amount of trophies they have won in previous years and winning trophies is the best thing you can do in sport.</p>

      <p>Singleton agreed his move back to Saracens in April and would have expected to join a team looking to remain at the top echelons in this country and in Europe.</p>
      <p>But if Mark McCall’s men are hit with a 35-point deduction, they would have to face up to the prospect of a relegation battle.</p>
      <p>Former Worcester hooker Singleton has plenty of experience in that department at his old club, although he is focusing on the positives of his switch and delighted to get the chance to feature in the Champions Cup on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Saracens will kick off Pool Four and the defence of their European crown with a tough clash away to Racing 92.</p>

      <p>“We don’t know what the future holds so we have to focus on what is next for us and that’s Racing in the Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>“It’s a massive test and this is another reason why I wanted to join a club like Saracens, to play in these European games. What a place to play, Racing in their new stadium.”</p>
      <p>Hooker Singleton will be competing with England team-mate Jamie George at Allianz Park but praised his club colleague.</p>
      <p>“Jamie is a great guy and even while on camp, he has helped me develop as a player,” he said.</p>
