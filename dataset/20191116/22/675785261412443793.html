      <h2>Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are usually highlighted as the key to Liverpool's attacking but Graeme Souness has spotlighted Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Hopkinson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-hopkinson/</a></address>
      <p>Graeme Souness won’t have any talk of Liverpool’s attacking prowess these days... without mention of Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
      <p>For some time now Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino have taken all the plaudits as they carve out a reputation as the most fearsome front three in world football.</p>
      <p>But Anfield legend Souness insists that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s attack must now be regarded as a fab FIVE, given everything the full-backs bring to the party.</p>
      <p>Souness said: “Liverpool have won nothing yet, and anything can happen. What about injuries to a couple of the main players?</p>

      <p>“You’d be talking about Firmino, Salah and Mane. But equally as important would be if both those full-backs were missing. They are a big part of Liverpool’s attacking plan.</p>
      <p>“You don’t see their names up there as goalscorers, but you see them providing the assists. It’s the goalscorers and badge-kissers that make you think, ‘What if they were out?’ But Trent and Andy are equally important.”</p>
      <p>Souness, 66, played seven seasons at Anfield as Liverpool won five league titles, three European Cups and four League Cups, establishing the club as the most dominant force in English football. They won 11 of their 18 titles between 1972 and 1990.</p>

      <p>And while Souness believes this current group of Reds stars will be in the title mix for the next few years at least, he also knows that one title win won’t automatically lead to another sustained period of supremacy.</p>
      <p>The Scot said: “You can never say they will go into a period of dominance because you have to look at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> – they will be around for a long time.</p>
      <p>“There’s the emergence of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> ’s youngsters too. Will they get better in the next few years?</p>

      <p>“And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> will be back, guaranteed. It’s just a case of when.</p>
      <p>“So you can’t say Liverpool are going to dominate.</p>
      <p>“But once you’ve won the first one, it does give you a taste to win it again. When I was there I was made to feel, ‘This is what we do – win leagues’.</p>
      <p>“That was the No.1 aim on the first day of the season, the league, not the European Cup. They felt that said more about you as an individual and a team.”</p>
      <p>But Souness senses new belief in a return to domestic glory days.</p>
      <p>He added: “There’s an excitement around the place and an atmosphere in the ground that wasn’t there when I was there.</p>
      <p>“Maybe I was so absorbed in playing football that I blanked all that out, but when I go there now, it’s spine-tingling.”</p>
