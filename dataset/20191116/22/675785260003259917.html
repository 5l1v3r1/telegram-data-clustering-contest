      <h2>Arsenal haven't won a Premier League match since October 6 and are currently on a five game winless streak, which has piled the pressure on manager Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery has a month to save his job at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> – but there is a belief inside the club that sacking the Spaniard will still not solve the crisis at the ­Emirates.</p>
      <p>Emery was given a vote of ­confidence by the Gunners’ head of football Raul Sanllehi in the ­aftermath of a 2-0 defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> last week, which saw them slump to sixth in the Premier League after a run of just two wins from 10 games.</p>
      <p>But Emery’s fate will be decided by ­the run of Premier League games, against struggling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , Norwich, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> – as well as the visit of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on ­December 15.</p>
      <p>Arsenal must also negotiate ­Europa League ties against ­Eintracht Frankfurt and Standard Liege during that period.</p>

      <p>But some staff fear that Emery now faces an impossible task to ­revive a club that has lost its heart and soul since Arsene Wenger’s ­near 22-year reign came to an end.</p>
      <p>Wenger transformed the Gunners by building on traditional Highbury virtues with the innovative modern methods he imported from abroad.</p>
      <p>Just 18 months after leaving the club, insiders claim the Frenchman’s legacy has been destroyed by a string of disastrous high-level ­appointments.</p>
      <p>One source said: “The DNA that made ­Arsenal the club it was has slowly but surely drained away.</p>

      <p>“Appointments have been made – both before and after Wenger’s departure – that either didn’t work out or aren’t working out.</p>
      <p>“Long-serving members of staff have been shocked by what’s ­happening to the club.”</p>
      <p>Bringing in former midfielder Edu in the summer to work as technical director alongside Sanllehi and academy manager Pep Mertesacker was supposed to herald a new beginning.</p>
      <p>But all of Wenger’s most trusted people have now left.</p>
      <p>And Emery has found himself struggling to stabilise the club on the pitch as Arsenal undergo their biggest upheaval since Wenger’s ­arrival in 1996.</p>
      <p>Steve Morrow, the former ­midfielder who became a highly ­respected head of youth ­recruitment, was the highest-profile ­casualty of a clear-out rubber-stamped by Edu and Mertesacker this month as they look to revamp the academy ­scouting set-up.</p>

      <p>The insider added: “To say it was a shock to see so many good people leave so suddenly is an ­understatement.</p>
      <p>“Steve Morrow, in particular, is a huge loss. He is someone who is ­respected throughout football and is seen as having the potential to be a director of football.”</p>
      <p>Chief scout Steve Rowley, the man who unearthed a succession of top talent for the Gunners over more than 30 years, was forced out of the club two years ago by then-chief ­executive Ivan Gazidis.</p>
      <p>Gazidis himself left the Emirates last year to become chief football ­officer at AC Milan. His departure saw Sanllehi promoted into his ­current role. The former director of football at ­ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> had initially ­arrived at Arsenal 12 months earlier as head of football relations.</p>
      <p>It has not gone well for Gazidis, 55, in Italy.</p>

      <p>Last month, he was ­accused by angry fans of “destroying” Milan when manager Marco Giampaolo was axed after a poor start to the season.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans have also got reasons to be unhappy with him. He was ­instrumental in appointing Emery as manager last May.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta was in pole position to succeed Wenger, after furthering his coaching expertise under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>But, with City bracing themselves for an official approach, Gazidis turned to Emery.</p>
      <p>Gazidis also got his way when Andries Jonker ­arrived as academy ­director in 2014.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman was an ­unmitigated failure and now works back in his homeland for second division club Telstar after a short <br/>ill-fated spell in charge of Wolfsburg. ­German Sven Mislintat lasted just 14 months after being made head of scouting in November 2017.</p>
      <p>He was part of a three-man panel, including Gazidis and ­Sanllehi, which voted to bring in Emery.</p>
      <p>Gazidis’s belief that the club should invest in information and data specialists also led to the appointment of Hendrik ­Almstadt as head of technical data.</p>
      <p>The German shared Gazidis’s belief that top players could be identified by compiling statistical databases.</p>
      <p>But Wenger was ­unconvinced by Almstadt’s methods and he left after five unsuccessful years before also failing to make an impression at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>When Huss Fahmy was brought in to handle player contracts in 2017, it prompted the departure of transfer fixer Dick Law, another of Wenger’s most trusted confidants.</p>
      <p>Emery is in the firing line, but, unless Arsenal’s decline is ­reversed, pressure will mount on Sanllehi and those he surrounded himself with after becoming the main man at the club.</p>
