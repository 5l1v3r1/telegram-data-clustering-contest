      <h1>Elizabeth Warren backs Taylor Swift in music battle, rips private equity firms</h1>

      <p>Elizabeth Warren might soon find a place on Taylor Swift’s squad.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1195777715544166401">Democratic presidential candidate chimed in</a> about the <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867">superstar songstress’s tweet</a> in which she claimed she was banned from performing her old songs at the American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, @TaylorSwift13 is one of many whose work has been threatened by a private equity firm,” Warren tweeted. “They’re gobbling up more and more of our economy, costing jobs and crushing entire industries. It’s time to rein in private equity firms — and I’ve got a plan for that.”</p>
      <p>The feud centers around Scooter Braun, a major music manager who worked with the likes of Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, and Scott Borchetta, whose Big Machine Label Group was sold to Braun for more than $300 million. That includes the vast majority of Swift’s work.</p>
      <p>Braun and Borchetta denied the claims Friday, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/15/scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-slam-taylor-swifts-claims-about-amas/?_ga=2.220691866.367296023.1573909087-1417521866.1572697485">telling Page Six</a> that Swift’s claims are “false information.”</p>
