      <p>In a statement, the BSP said the net inflows in October resulted from the $1.25-billion inflows during the month versus $1.15-billion outflows.</p>
      <p>Compared to same time last year, the current results were also an improvement from October 2018’s $67.83-million net outflows.</p>
      <p>The central bank said 81.9 percent of inflows went into listed stocks such as holding firms, banks, property companies, retail companies, and food, beverage and tobacco companies.<br/>About 18.1 percent were invested in peso government securities.</p>
      <p>Bulk or 73.9 percent of inflows came from investors in the United Kingdom, US, Singapore, Luxembourg, and Malaysia.</p>
      <p>According to the BSP, the local and global developments that influenced the movement of hot money during the period are: the US and China trade discussions; initial public offerings by firms in the industrial and services sectors; the BSP’s decision to reduce the reserve requirement ratio for universal/commercial and thrift banks by 100 basis points; and<br/>further slowdown of headline inflation to 0.8 percent in October from 0.9 percent in September.</p>
      <p>Based on BSP data, total registered investments increased by 31.5 percent year-on-year while gross outflows were higher by 12.5 percent compared to the outflows in 2018.</p>
      <p>The outflows decreased in October compared to September’s $1.53 billion with US investors still the major beneficiary of these withdrawals with a 74.8 percent share of total.</p>
