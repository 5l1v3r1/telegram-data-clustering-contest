      <p>But the party, led by Patrick Harvie, was left out of the hour-long grilling nine days before the vote — prompting a furious claim it’s handing the big parties an advantage based on their deeper coffers.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said last: “We’re extremely disappointed that STV has chosen to include just the four establishment parties in its General Election leaders debate.</p>
      <p>“We are in the midst of a climate emergency and while our candidates demand climate action, the other parties are part of a cosy political consensus on this key issue, all agreeing with one another.</p>
      <p>“Our record as Scotland’s most influential opposition party includes transforming Scotland’s income tax system. We led the way on children’s rights by providing them with equal protection from assault.</p>
      <p>“And we scrapped unnecessary invasive social security assessments. This shows the impact Scottish Greens politicians have.”</p>
      <p>But the spokesman continued: “Unlike the other parties we don’t have unlimited resources and millionaire donors.</p>
      <p>“That’s why our local branches need to decide carefully how to deploy resources and unfortunately that means we can’t stand everywhere.</p>
      <p>“It’s deeply depressing that STV has allowed an unfair voting system and financial advantage, rather than actual political influence, to drive its decision.”</p>
      <p>The Greens are the only political party with seats in the Scottish Parliament to be excluded from the hour-long debate.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party and Ukip, who are standing in 15 and seven Scottish seats respectively, are also excluded.</p>
      <p>STV says it is also planning a series of interviews with party leaders including those from the Brexit Party and Scottish Greens, due to be aired at an unspecified date. BBC Scotland chiefs have already announced a televised debate involving leaders from the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems to be shown on December 10.</p>
      <p>And UK-wide political broadcasts are also planned, starting on Tuesday with a head-to-head debate between Tory boss Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn being aired on ITV, followed by a similar format on BBC One on December 6.</p>
      <p>The SNP and Lib Dems — the third and fourth biggest Westminster parties in terms of seats — threatened legal action against ITV for their exclusion from the national debates.</p>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon said it was “fundamentally unfair” not to include her party, the third-largest in the UK.</p>
      <p>STV confirmed the format of its broadcast will see the party leaders debate each other directly, and face questions from host Colin Mackay, the channel’s political editor.</p>
