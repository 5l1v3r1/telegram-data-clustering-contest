      <h1>Jaclyn Hill Will Be Launching A Full Cosmetics Line After Viral Lipstick Snafu</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:20:13+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Just months after her lipstick launch went terribly awry, Jaclyn Hill filed for a trademark for a full cosmetics line. The Beautuber recently took to social media to tell fans that she has a lot coming.</p>
      <p>The Jaclyn Hill Cosmetics and Jaclyn Hill trademark were filed in July. The line will include lipstick, blush, skin bronzer, eye shadow, false eyelashes ,and make-up brushes.</p>
      <p>Her Instagram account shared that a collection of highlighters will be available for sale on November 26.</p>
      <p>This comes after <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/jaclyn-hill-to-refund-everyone-who-purchased-her-lipstick-that-was-contaminated-after-complaints-go-viral-296289/">the viral disaster for her So Rich Lipstick collection</a> that turned dangerous after customers found everything from hair to glass shards in their products.</p>

      <p>The beauty guru apologized to fans in a video where she explained what happened. She also took responsibility and refunded all purchases.</p>
      <p>Since then, Jaclyn has been working on getting it right.</p>
      <p>‘At Jaclyn Cosmetics, we’re dedicated to giving you the best products &amp; customer experience. It is clear that our first launch did not meet the standards we’ve set as a brand, and for that we are truly sorry. We will do better because you deserve better from us and from our products. As we take a moment to rebuild, we just want you to know how grateful we are for the love and support we’ve received. Your satisfaction is our top priority. The future is bright, and we’re so excited for what’s to come,’ the makeup account reads.</p>
      <p>Last month Hill was slammed for going as herself for Halloween.</p>
      <p>She showed up to her party proudly flaunting a ‘canceled’ title as fans took to Twitter with their grievances. Some felt that she was mocking the fact that people spent their hard-earned money on defective products.</p>
      <p>Jaclyn insisted that it was not meant to be an insult to her fan base but was merely mocking cancel culture.</p>
      <p>Will you purchase something from her line?</p>
