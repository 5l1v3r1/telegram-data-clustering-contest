      <h1>Betances? Hamels? How Mets can spend their Zack Wheeler money</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:20:47+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Puma</a></address>
      <p>The Mets had to be prepared for the slim possibility Zack Wheeler would accept their qualifying offer and return to the rotation next season.</p>
      <p>So, theoretically, that’s $17.8 million the Mets had budgeted toward pitching for 2020 that became available when Wheeler last week<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/zack-wheeler-declines-mets-qualifying-offer-with-eye-on-free-agent-mega-deal/"> declined the qualifying offer</a> to pursue free agency.</p>
      <p>Now the question becomes how general manager Brodie Van Wagenen might expend that allotment in trying to fill holes in the pitching staff.</p>
      <p>Van Wagenen, at the GM meetings, indicated the team would be open to negotiating with Wheeler, but that would also mean a potential bidding war with teams such as the Yankees, Angels, Dodgers and Braves — all of whom would be paying for Wheeler’s upside more than his solid but unspectacular past two seasons with the Mets.</p>
      <p>More likely, in another offseason in which the Mets haven’t provided any clues they will be looking to drastically increase payroll, the team has seen the last of Wheeler and will have to decide how to allocate that $17.8 million for next year.</p>
      <p>Last offseason, with a full rotation, Van Wagenen spent $40 million on multi-year contracts to Jeurys Familia and Justin Wilson that addressed the bullpen. Familia flopped, but Wilson emerged as a dependable piece on whom the Mets are counting, especially if Familia or Edwin Diaz struggle to rebound next season.</p>

      <p>The safer route for the Mets, rather than subtracting Seth Lugo or Robert Gsellman from the bullpen to address the rotation then spending big on relievers, could be to hedge the bet. That would mean dividing between rotation and bullpen the $17.8 million that was earmarked for Wheeler next season.</p>
      <p>Along those guidelines, here are starting and relief possibilities to consider that, when combined, would likely get the Mets into that ballpark financially:</p>
      <h3>Starting pitcher</h3>
      <p><b>Cole Hamels:</b> The thought of this former Phillies ace (who turns 36 next season) pitching for the Mets seems strange, but it couldn’t be any stranger for fans than Tom Glavine’s stint in Flushing.<br/><b><br/>Michael Pineda:</b> The right-hander is serving a PED suspension that will cost him the first six weeks of next season, but has New York experience from his four seasons with the Yankees.</p>
      <p><b>Rick Porcello: </b>The New Jersey native has trended downward in recent seasons after winning the Cy Young award for the Red Sox in 2016, but could benefit from a switch to the National League.</p>
      <p><b>Wade Miley:</b> The lefty had a late-season slump, but still finished with a 3.98 ERA for the Astros after resurrecting his career with the Brewers the previous year.</p>
      <p><b>Ivan Nova: </b>The former Yankees pitcher led the AL in hits allowed (225), but still gave the White Sox 187 innings last season.</p>
      <h3>Bullpen</h3>
      <p><b>Will Harris:</b> The right-hander had a breakout year for the Astros, pitching to a 1.50 ERA and 0.933 WHIP. Harris specializes in weak contact and inducing grounders.</p>
      <p><b>Daniel Hudson: </b>If he came to New York and pitched well, a river would probably be named in his honor. The right-hander dominated for the Nationals late in the season and was a key component in their World Series run.</p>
      <p><b>Drew Pomeranz: </b>The left-hander dominated for the Brewers in the second half of last season, striking out an eye-popping 45 batters in 26 ¹/₃ innings.</p>
      <p><b>Dellin Betances:</b> The right-hander could be a low-risk, high-reward addition after injuries decimated his 2019 season. But can the Mets afford to take risks given the unpredictability of Familia and Diaz bring?</p>
      <p><b>Craig Stammen:</b> Over the past three seasons, he’s second among major league relievers with 241 ¹/₃ innings pitched, and the right-hander was extremely consistent over that stretch for the Padres.</p>
