      <h2>Stuart Pearce retired from international football, for the first time, after Gareth Southgate's penalty shocker in the Euro 1996 semi-final defeat to Germany</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:30:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>When Gareth Southgate urges his England team to seize the moment next summer, the tale of Stuart Pearce retiring from ­international football on the team bus might be used to emphasis the point.</p>
      <p>It will be 24 years since Southgate missed the ­semi-final shoot-out penalty against Germany that cost the Three Lions the chance to bring football home.</p>
      <p>The England boss was 25. He had already shed tears of ­disappointment on the ­Wembley pitch when Pearce used the journey back to the hotel to tell his team-mates his international career was over.</p>
      <p>And that was when the full horrible reality of failure set in.</p>
      <p>Southgate recalled: “When we lost in ’96, the most heartbreaking thing for me was when Stuart Pearce retired on the bus home.</p>

      <p>“Stuart then came back – twice! But he actually did retire on the bus on the way home and that was the moment when it really sunk in.</p>
      <p>“I thought: ‘Oh my god, that was his last chance.’ It was my first tournament – and when it’s your first tournament you think there will be loads more.</p>
      <p>“The group we have now is slightly different, because I think most of the players are going to peak in two or four years’ time.</p>
      <p>“But we have to find a way to get the maximum out of them, as we did two summers ago. Let’s see how far we can get.”</p>

      <p>Southgate has been quick to clamp down on suggestions that he has built a Golden ­Generation.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane is the striking talisman who will surely one day shatter Wayne Rooney’s England scoring record. And Raheem Sterling has developed into a player good enough to make <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> believe he can become their saviour.</p>
      <p>But there is no Paul ­Gascoigne, David Beckham or Rooney to dominate the agenda – just as there wasn’t when England reached their first World Cup semi-final since 1990 less than two years ago.</p>

      <p>Southgate knows he has a squad brimming with fearless young talent and strengthened by the row which saw Sterling pick a fight with Joe Gomez last week, rather than weakened.</p>
      <p>And England will go on the road to prepare for the Euros, with games planned for the provinces and a pre-­tournament friendly that will be staged outside of Europe.</p>
      <p>But while Southgate will look for his men to take ­advantage of a tournament that sees them play their three group games at Wembley next summer – and hopefully a semi-final and final – he will dial back on any unrealistic ­expectations.</p>
      <p>He said: “We have got some excellent players, but I would imagine Sven Goran-Eriksson thought the same of Beckham, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick, Steve Gerrard and Frank ­Lampard. If you’re the England manager, you’re normally in a reasonably privileged position.</p>
      <p>“But we have given young players their opportunity ahead of their time – and that has given us a greater depth.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got competition now because guys believe they’ve got a chance. It will be a ­brilliant experience to have the group matches at home, but then we’re going to have to go on the road and win too.</p>
      <p>“We could end up playing Spain in Rome – and there’s all sorts of other possible ties.”</p>
