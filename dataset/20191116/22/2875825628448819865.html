      <h2>Theresa McGrath says she deeply regrets driving after she had consumed too much alcohol</h2>

      <p>A mother of eight has apologised for drink-driving in the hope it will deter others from getting behind the wheel after consuming alcohol.</p>
      <p>Cork woman Theresa McGrath was found to be over the legal limit after the incident in July.</p>
      <p>The mum says she deeply regrets driving after she had consumed too much alcohol.</p>
      <p>Theresa told the Irish Sunday Mirror: “There are two things I would change in my life – my mother dying and that incident.</p>
      <p>“Was it wrong? Of course. Hindsight is a great thing. It’s not an excuse but I was just too drunk and I didn’t know what I was doing.”</p>

      <p>Theresa, who lives in Fermoy, had been drinking heavily on a night out in the north Cork town before she was arrested.</p>
      <p>She explained it was out of character for her to have consumed so much alcohol.</p>
      <p>She said: “I went out around 8pm and drove in with my keys in my bag.</p>
      <p>“I had every intention of getting a taxi home but there was none available. I remember getting into my car but I don’t remember anything after that.”</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old was planning to drive to her partner’s house a few minutes from the bar.</p>
      <p>While en-route, she crashed into a parked vehicle in a nearby housing estate and her car was a write-off.</p>
      <p>She also damaged an ESB pole, broke her foot in the impact, but has no recollection of the crash.</p>
      <p>Within minutes gardai arrived at the scene, arrested the mum and took her to the nearby Garda station.</p>
      <p>Theresa, who has an extensive social media following, soon found out the incident had surfaced online.</p>
      <p>She went on to receive hundreds of messages of hate and bullying.</p>
      <p>Theresa said she understands why people would be angry at her, especially families of loved ones who died as a result of drink-drivers.</p>
      <p>The situation got so bad she began to have suicidal thoughts and admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital.</p>
      <p>Theresa added: “I wanted to end my life as I thought there was no way out of this so I admitted myself to a mental health facility.</p>
      <p>“It all just got too much. My private life was being played out online in front of thousands of people.</p>
      <p>“I was called a whore, an unfit mother and some of the messages were so bad I shudder when I think of it.”</p>
      <p>Theresa, who shares her children with her ex-partner, said she was ashamed when she had to reveal the news to her kids about what had happened.</p>
      <p>She added: “My eldest son Mark [17] thought I was the stupidest person ever. My 14-year-old daughter Serena was disgusted with me, she let me know I could have killed someone.</p>
      <p>“I was so embarrassed for them that their mother could have done this. I felt like the child.”</p>
      <p>Theresa wants to publicly apologise to members of the Irish Road Victims Association for her actions and is urging drivers not to get behind the wheel if they have drank alcohol.</p>
      <p>She added: “It’s the luck of God I didn’t kill anyone. I don’t care about my car or my foot, I should have not got into that car and I have only myself to blame.”</p>
