      <h1>Euro 2020 wrap: Northern Ireland pay the penalty as Germany and Holland head to finals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:26:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Germany and Holland secured their places at Euro 2020 from qualifying Group C as Northern Ireland were left to try their luck in the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Toni Kroos scored twice as Germany beat Belarus 4-0 in Monchengladbach, while the Dutch held out for a goalless draw at Windsor Park – where Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis missed a first-half penalty.</p>
      <p>Defender Matthias Ginter had given Germany the lead just before half-time when he backheel flicked in a cross from Serge Gnabry at the near post.</p>
      <p>Leon Goretzka made it 2-0 soon after the restart with a low drive after the ball was cut back from a corner and Kroos clipped home a third in the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>With 15 minutes left, Belarus were awarded a penalty when Freiburg defender Robin Koch tripped Pavel Nekhajchik – Manuel Neuer, though, saved Igor Stasevich’s spot-kick.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid midfielder Kroos produced great close control to slot in Germany’s fourth with seven minutes left.</p>
      <p>Croatia made sure of qualification from Group E as they beat 10-man Slovakia 3-1 in Rijeka.</p>
      <p>The visitors had taken a surprise lead in the 32nd minute through Robert Bozenik.</p>
      <p>Nikola Vlasic fired Croatia level after 56 minutes with a low finish, before Bruno Petkovic headed in from a corner on the hour.</p>
      <p>Slovakia saw winger Robert Mak sent off for a second yellow card, with Ivan Perisic’s volley sealing a place at Euro 2020 for the World Cup runners-up.</p>
