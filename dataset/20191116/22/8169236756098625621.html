      <h1>Arsenal target £43m-rated star to fix struggling defence in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:53:15+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:53</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360897/arsenal-january-transfer-pau-torres/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573942330">the Sun</a>, Arsenal are considering a move for Villarreal star Pau Torres in the January transfer window in a bid to solve their defensive issues.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old scored on his debut for Spain last night and he’s quickly emerging as one of the best young centre-backs in Europe.</p>
      <p>The Sun add that the defender has a £43m release clause in his contract, it will be interesting to see if the Gunners decide to splash the cash after their splurge this past summer.</p>
      <p>The report reiterates that the north London outfit would hope to structure a potential deal for the defender in a similar manner to the way in which they secured Nicolas Pepe from Lille this summer.</p>
      <p>Arsenal only paid £20m of the total £72m deal up front, as per the Sun.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the Gunners may have to battle Manchester City for the defender’s signature.</p>

      <p>Unai Emery has so far failed to address Arsenal’s key shortcoming since being appointed – the team’s defence.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are sitting sixth in the Premier League, yet they have the joint-worst goal difference (-1) of sides in the top ten. This isn’t good enough for a team that hope to get themselves back in to the Champions League spots.</p>
      <p>Torres could prove to be an excellent signing for the Gunners, the ace would add to an already young defensive line that are yet to fully take shape.</p>
      <p>Hector Bellerin, Kieran Tierney, Rob Holding and even Calum Chambers have the potential to lead the team in the future.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the best way to ensure Arsenal solve their defensive problems is to install a young foundation of talent at the back.</p>
