      <p>I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!’s Nadine Coyle is already in tears on the show, and it hasn’t even truly started yet.</p>
      <p>The Girls Aloud favourite can be seen tearfully embracing Caitlyn Jenner as they’re forced to skydive into the jungle – before they’ve even found the camp.</p>
      <p>In scenes from Sunday’s show, the pair are teamed up together for a very dramatic task as they prepare to start their jungle journey.</p>
      <p>Reality TV legend Caitlyn and Girls Aloud pop royalty Nadine take part in their first challenge with fellow campers rugby player James Haskell and Radio 1 DJ Adele Roberts.</p>
      <p>Whilst James and Adele have the rather nice task of canoeing down a stream to collect Pontoons, Cailtlyn and Nadine instead are asked to throw themselves out of a plane in order to gather the keys needing to unlock said Pontoons.</p>

      <p>But it all seems to get a bit too much for the Call The Shots singer, who is seen grabbing an emotional moment with her new friend.</p>

      <p>But we’ll have to see how it goes down on Sunday’s launch show.</p>
      <p>The pictures come after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebrity-bosses-confirm-live-bugs-wont-be-eaten-in-bush-tucker-trials-11168266/">ITV confirmed that live insects will no longer be used on any eating trials</a> in the programme.</p>
      <p>It was claimed<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebrity-bosses-ban-live-insects-from-bushtucker-trials-after-animal-rights-backlash-11165998/"> that no celebs would be chowing down on any critters that were still crawling</a> during the famous eating trials.</p>
      <p>And bosses have now announced the change has been implemented and it will be permanent.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>A rep for I’m A Celeb told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘No live critters will be eaten in the Bush Tucker trials this year. Producers have taken a look at the trials and decided that no live critters would be eaten this year.</p>
      <p>‘They have been planning this for some time and actually last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they’ve decided to implement the change fully and permanently.’</p>
      <p>Now creepy crawlies, well they won’t be crawling, they’ll still be creepy.</p>
