      <p>Overnight leader Zander Lombard recovered from a horror start to card a par score of 72 and hold a one-shot lead after the third round of the European Tour's Nedbank Golf Challenge at the Gary Player Country Club on Saturday.</p>
      <p>SUN CITY, South Africa: Overnight leader Zander Lombard recovered from a horror start to card a par score of 72 and hold a one-shot lead after the third round of the European Tour's Nedbank Golf Challenge at the Gary Player Country Club on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lombard, ranked number 234 in the world and without a win on the European Tour, will head into Sunday with a tournament total of 11 under-par as slippery greens and challenging pin placements meant another day of high scores in the third round.</p>

      <p>He saw his overnight lead cut by a shot on Saturday, but is aiming to become the second home player to win 'Africa's Major' since 2008.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was three over-par after eight holes, a sloppy start following his impressive 65 on Friday, but recovered to card four birdies in his final 10 holes.</p>
      <p>He is one shot ahead of compatriot Louis Oosthuizen (71) and Belgian Thomas Detry (69), whose erratic back nine saw him joint leader with Lombard heading down the 18th fairway before a dropped shot.</p>
      <p>Detry carded 35 on his front nine, but his run heading back to the clubhouse included five birdies, a bogey and a double-bogey in what was truly a mixed bag.</p>
      <p>Englishman Oliver Wilson carded seven birdies and two bogeys for a 67 to go into Sunday on eight under-par for the tournament and in touch with the leaders. He is joined on that score by Swede Marcus Kinhult (70).</p>
      <p>The Nedbank Golf Challenge is the penultimate tournament in the 2019 Race to Dubai, whose leader, Austrian Bernd Wiesberger, carded 70 on Saturday for a tournament total of six under-par and a share of sixth position.</p>
