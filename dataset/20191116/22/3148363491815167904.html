      <h1>Free Tickets to Kanye West Performance at Joel Osteen’s Church Scalped for Hundreds of Dollars</h1>
      <h2>Online entrepreneurs are scalping free tickets to rapper Kanye West’s Nov. 17 “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tag/sunday-service/">Sunday Service</a>” at Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church for hundreds of dollars as faithful and fans struggle to find a space in the sold-out 17,000-seat church.</h2>

      <p>The widely touted concert promoting West’s new gospel-rap album <i>Jesus Is King</i> has been expected to draw “huge crowds,” the Christian Post <a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/tickets-to-kanye-wests-sunday-service-at-joel-osteens-church-being-scalped-for-hundreds-of-dollars.html">reported</a>, an estimation corroborated by the frantic last-minute rush to get tickets even at exorbitant prices.</p>
      <p>As a typical example, one online ticket-seller identified as @takingpayment is offering four tickets to the West &amp; Osteen Sunday Service for $300 each or $1000 for all four.</p>

      <p>Roughly half of the tickets for the Lakewood Church service were made available to church members through a special pre-offer requiring a code, while the other half were offered to the general public.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the event said that general admission tickets became available from TicketMaster as of 10:00am Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>“This is a FREE event, but attendees must have a mobile e-ticket. A FREE general admission mobile e-ticket can be obtained through TicketMaster.com or the TicketMaster App beginning at 10 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 16,” the spokesperson said. “Anything other than Ticketmaster would be fraudulent.”</p>
      <p>While the church concert will begin around 7:00pm, ticket-holders will be allowed into the church starting at 5:30pm. Attendees will be permitted to start lining up for the event at 4:00pm.</p>
      <p>“The evening Sunday Service will include musical performances with Kanye West and his choir. It will be streamed Live on Facebook.com/JoelOsteen, YouTube.com, LakewoodChurch.com, the Lakewood Church App, and sundayservice.com,” reads a statement from the church.</p>
      <p>Kanye West, who converted to Christianity this year, is also <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/13/kanye-west-to-appear-on-stage-at-joel-osteens-church-sunday/">slated</a> to appear on stage Sunday morning at 11:00am to offer a testimony at the megachurch in the form of a 30-minute live conversation with Osteen.</p>
      <p>“Joel is still putting his questions together, but he will talk about Kanye’s journey to his faith,” said Donald Iloff, Jr., a senior executive at Joel Osteen Ministries earlier this week.</p>
      <p>“Kanye and Joel are friends. He’s been wanting to come out for some time and it just worked out for this weekend,” Iloff said</p>
      <p>Lakewood Church is America’s largest megachurch, and draws an average of nearly 50,000 attendees each weekend, and its celebrated pastor, Joel Osteen, is followed by a television audience of some 10 million people.</p>
      <p>Osteen and his wife, Victoria, are both “excited” about what God has been doing through West, the Lakewood spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>“We’re excited. It’s really neat to see what God is doing in Kanye’s life. Joel is very excited, Joel and Victoria. It will be a fantastic weekend,” the spokesperson said. “It’s going to bring a lot of people who have never been to Lakewood as well. Kanye has a big influence on the culture.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week West <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/16/watch-kanye-west-brings-sunday-service-to-houston-jail-this-is-a-mission-not-a-show/">brought</a> his Sunday Service to inmates in a Houston, Texas, jail.</p>
