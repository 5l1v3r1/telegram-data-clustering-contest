      <h1>Rangers loan star Glenn Middleton makes veiled Paul Heckingbottom dig and delivers Jack Ross Hibs appeal</h1>
      <h2>The on-loan Ibrox winger has found minutes hard to come by at Hibs and hopes a new boss can change his fortunes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:29:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Glenn Middleton will be grateful for the chance to show <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> what he can do for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> – after being sidelined for what he <br/>supposedly couldn’t.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has been frustrated by only one start since September as axed boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> watched the Easter Road side’s leads crumble at every turn.</p>
      <p>But Middleton hopes for a clean slate and a fresh start under winger-friendly new gaffer Ross, who will be officially announced tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The on-loan <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> kid said: “At times it has been frustrating at Hibs recently but hopefully I can kick on under the new manager.</p>
      <p>“When I went to Hibs I knew I had things I could bring to the team, but I knew there were things for me to work on too.</p>
      <p>“But I feel my strong points outweigh any negatives that I have.</p>

      <p>“Any coach is going to have their opinion and there isn’t much you can do about it when they are the ones picking the team.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately it’s down to me to prove I can do the things the coach asks of me.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to be sitting on the bench. I’m desperate to play, so hopefully I can get that chance soon.”</p>
      <p>Middleton came closest to giving Scotland Under-21s the win they craved against Greece after <br/>coming on as an impact sub on Friday night.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t to be as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scot-gemmill">Scot Gemmill</a> ’s kids slipped to a last gasp 1-0 defeat to the 10 men and then were involved in an ugly post-match rammy.</p>
      <p>Middleton sighed: “We should be able to rise above what happened at the end.</p>
      <p>“It was just a frustrating night.</p>
      <p>“There are positives to look back on but we know we should be winning games like this.”</p>
