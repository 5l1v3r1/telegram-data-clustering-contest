      <p>A Postmates driver wants money from Lizzo over her ruthless social media bullying.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Lizzo probably didn't realize an angry tweet over some food when she was hungry would land her in a complicated lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The “Truth Hurts” rapper aired out her Postmates delivery driver when she didn’t get the food she ordered in September of 2017.</p>
      <p>In the tweet, Lizzo called out the driver’s name, stating “Hey @Postmates this girl Tiffany W. sole my food she lucky I don’t fight no more,” with a photo of Tiffany’s face.</p>
      <p>Now, Tiffany is going after Lizzo, real name Melissa Jefferson in court.</p>
      <p>Since then, Tiffany says she has received threats and is now concerned for her safety.</p>
      <p>In fact, Tiffany left Postmates because of that very incident.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/15/lizzo-sued-by-postmates-delivery-person-for-defamation/">TMZ reports</a> Tiffany Wells is suing Lizzo for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>
      <p>After the incident, Lizzo claimed she was at fault and that Tiffany did nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>Tiffany claims she went above and beyond to try to find Lizzo in the hotel to try to deliver the food, but came up short. Tiffany said Postmates sided with her in the situation.</p>
      <p>This has caused Tiffany Wells much stress, anxiety, and embarrassment so she is suing for an undisclosed amount.</p>
      <p>Damn, Lizzo!</p>
