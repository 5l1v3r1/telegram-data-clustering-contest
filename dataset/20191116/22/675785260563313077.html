      <h1>Piers Morgan brands Prince Andrew interview 'desperate toe curling bulls**t'</h1>
      <h2>The ITV Good Morning Britain host praised BBC Newsnight interview Emily Maitlis' 'forensic' interview skills - but did not rate the Duke of York's performance at all</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T22:55:38+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 22:55</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>Piers Morgan has offered a scathing review of Prince Andrew's performance in his first interview on his links with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>While the ITV Good Morning Host had praise for BBC Newsnight Emily Maiitlis' "brilliant forensic" interviewing skills during the hour-long probe that aired tonight, his appraisal of the Duke of York's delivery was less flattering.</p>
      <p>"Desperate, toe-curling bullsh*t from Prince Andrew", tweeted Morgan. "Why on earth did he do this? Insane."</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew's extraordinary appearance on BBC Two tonight came as the royal faces intense scrutiny over his links to the disgraced financier.</p>
      <p>Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in March by apparent suicide as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the prince was photographed walking with Epstein in New York's Central Park - two years after Epstein's first conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>

      <p>In a wide-ranging interview broadcast on the BBC tonight, the prince claimed he had never even met Virginia Giuffre, formerly Virginia Roberts, who has accused him of having sex with her when she was 17.</p>
      <p>The prince told Maitlis he had did not recall meeting Ms Giuffre - also disputing the veracity of a photograph of him with his arm looped around the teenager.</p>
      <p>Actress Rose McGowan, a prominent figurehead in the #MeToo movement, also tweeted her reaction to the interview. </p>
      <p>She wrote: "Can Prince Andrew not remember Virginia Roberts, his accuser, because there were so many young girls? Am I hearing this right?"</p>
      <p>McGowan also responded to Morgan's tweet about Prince Andrew's 'bullsh**t" performance, writing:  I was wondering what you thought of this vile sh*t. I am nauseous. I know what his victims feel like, being ignored.</p>

      <p>"Watching the truth be white washed- it’s truly awful. Your monarchy is part of a predatory conspiracy. They need to fix this. Kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/maitlis">@maitlis</a>."</p>
      <p>Morgan responded, calling the interview: "excruciating."</p>
      <p>The Duke of York told Maitlis  he had been eating at Pizza Express with daughter Princess Beatrice on one night that Ms Giuffre claims she had sex with the prince when she was 17.</p>
      <p>He said he recalled the dinner at the pizza branch in Woking for a party "weirdly distinctly" as it was such a rare occurrence.</p>
      <p>When Maitlis asked the Prince about Ms Giuffre’s allegations that he was sweating when they danced in Tramp nightclub, the Prince said it was impossible.</p>
      <p>“There’s a slight problem with the sweating,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I have a peculiar medical condition.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply... it was almost impossible for me to sweat.”</p>
      <p>The Prince has said he and Epstein were not as close friends as some have suggested, and told Maitlis his New York home was a "convenient place to stay."</p>
