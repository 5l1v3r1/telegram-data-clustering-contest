      <p>Sante Fitness Lab, a premier one-stop fitness, sports performance training and physical therapy center, recently launched its Obstacle Course Racing camp at the Vermosa Sports Hub in Cavite.</p>
      <p>The camp aims to promote OCR as a sport and as a new and  exciting fitness program and facility to try. It gathered Santé business owners, employees, as well as the members of the Santé Barley OCR Team.</p>
      <p>SFL General Manager Clarize Lucindo said the camp seeks to encourage everyone to start their journey to fitness and lead a healthier lifestyle.</p>

      <p>“Just like any other workouts, OCR involves seemingly tough movements. But through SFL’s very own OCR camp, the basics of the sports are introduced and proper progressive training is provided. The camp is designed to be both fun and challenging to eventually help you to become fitter, be race ready,” added Lucindo.</p>
      <p>Despite being a seemingly hard sport, Santé OCR Team Head Coach Carlos Paca noted that OCR is a sport for everyone, be it a beginner or elite.</p>
      <p>“What makes OCR different are its benefits as it involves the whole body, making day to day activities a lot easier,” added Paca. “To those who have an athletic background, they can already partake in various OCR events to test themselves out. We also encourage beginners, as well, to try out our OCR camp as their fitness workout. This camp is a perfect activity as it involves maximizing the entirety of the body.”</p>
      <p>OCR involves running and overcoming various physical challenges in the form of obstacles, such as climbing up ropes, scaling walls, and monkey bars. The terrain also adds challenges to sports when running.</p>
      <p>The SFL’s OCR camp launch was powered by Sante’s new and improved FIT N’TRIM, a weight- management drink that has the signature organic barley grass powder from New Zealand, L-carnitine, and a zest of green tea and lemon flavor. This exciting drink served  as thirst quenchers and energy boosters to the OCR campers.</p>
      <p>SFL’s OCR Camp will now be available for all fitness enthusiasts, as well as those who want to try and learn the sport regardless of their fitness levels. With SFL’s premier facility that simulates the toughness of the sport, it makes for a perfect hub for both starter and competitive training. Whether you want to try it as a group, maybe as a company engagement activity, or a new sport to discover with your barkada, SFL is the place to be OCR-ready!</p>
      <p>Anybody who wants to ignite their road to fitness with scientifically-based programs for the best outcome, will be at home at SFL. Bearing the tagline “the New Home of Champions,” the hub serves as a training ground and rehabilitation facility not only for the elite and competitive athletes but also for everyday people who aim to be physically fit and overcome limitations to improve their quality of life.</p>
