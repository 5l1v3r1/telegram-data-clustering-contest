      <p>"Police will not hesitate to continue to take enforcement action against anyone found in possession of, supplying, trafficking or producing dangerous drugs," he said.</p>
      <p>Paramedics also treated 50 patients, including 27 females and 23 males, in the Emergency Treatment Centre. Only three required further assessment in hospital.</p>
      <p>Police said that in the same time frame last year, six schoolies and 11 non-schoolies had been arrested on 11 charges.</p>
      <p>The majority of the non-schoolies' charges related to drug and public nuisance offences.</p>
