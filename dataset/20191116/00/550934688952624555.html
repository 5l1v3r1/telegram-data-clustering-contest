      <h4>Police in Bonn shut down the city's main train station temporarily after a massive brawl broke out between rival protesters. The violence followed a neo-Nazi rally and large counterdemonstration in the town of Remagen.</h4>
      <p>Emergency services were deployed to Bonn's central railway station on Saturday night after clashes between "left-wing and right-wing groups," police told DW.</p>

      <p>The western German city's station was temporarily closed, with roads blocked and rail traffic suspended in both directions, DW's reporter Dana Regev wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Police said that some people fell from the platforms onto the train tracks during the scuffles, but that no one was injured.</p>

      <p>The violence followed an annual demonstration by neo-Nazi activists in Remagen, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) south of Bonn. Police said around 130 people had taken part in the afternoon event, while up to 900 others had joined a counterdemonstration.</p>
      <p>The fighting broke out at around 6 p.m. local time (1700 UTC) when a train carrying a number of protesters pulled into Bonn.</p>
      <p>Authorities said they had launched an investigation into serious breaches of the peace, among other charges.</p>

            <figcaption><b>Bridge over the River Rhine<br/></b>Securing the Ludendorff Bridge, undamaged, was a crucial strategic victory for the Allies in 1945. It allowed thousands of troops and vehicles to cross the vast River Rhine, and thus turn their eyes towards Berlin.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Immortalized in film in 'The Bridge at Remagen'<br/></b>Color war movie 'The Bridge at Remagen' (1969) brought the story of the bridge from military lore into the mainstream. The movie's version of events is highly accelerated, putting a far greater emphasis on infantry battles than the weeks of artillery duels that preceded the bridge's capture in real life.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Crucial crossing, gateway to rest of Germany<br/></b>Thousands of Allied troops crossed the bridge immediately after its seizure. Allied area bombing had damaged some Rhine crossings to the north, while the German Wehrmacht destroyed others in controlled explosions to slow down its adversaries.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Strategic asset, but vulnerable<br/></b>The 9th Armored Division of the US First Army became the first Allied troops to cross the Rhine after its capture on March 7, 1945. With the Russian Red Army advancing from the east, the pincer was now set.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Collapsed, but only after providing a bridgehead<br/></b>After losing control of the bridge, German forces repeatedly tried to destroy it. They succeeded on March 17, 10 days after its capture. But not before some 25,000 troops and vehicles had established themselves on the eastern bank.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Modern memorials<br/></b>This photo was taken on the 70th anniversary of the bridge's capture, May 7, 2015. The ceremony brought together veterans from around the world.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Museum to peace on western bank<br/></b>The Ludendorff Bridge, initially constructed for logistics purposes in World War I, was never rebuilt after its 1945 destruction. The towers on its western bank at Remagen (pictured here) were converted into a museum. Across the Rhine, in Erpel, the towers were made into a performing arts space — and they're now up for sale.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figcaption>Seizing the Ludendorff Bridge — intact — was a crucial strategic victory for the Allies in the latter stages of World War II. It provided them and their vehicles a path across the Rhine River, and on towards Berlin.</figcaption>
