Krause (27-7, 8-3 UFC) drew the curtain 4:19 into Round 3.<br/><br/>Moraes (14-6-1, 8-5-1 UFC) landed a takedown inside the first 15 seconds and progressed to side control, but he did nothing to exploit his advantage. Krause escaped into top position, returned to his feet and went to work with his standup, firing repeated kicks into the Brazilian’s lower lead leg. Moraes wilted in the second round, where he twice hit the deck on the end of punches from the American. As the fight drifted into its final minute, Krause sent a right cross crashing into the longtime Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt’s jaw. Moraes collapsed and was met with hammerfists that prompted the stoppage.<br/><br/>Krause, 33, now finds himself on a six-fight winning streak.</p>
      <h3>Ramos Throttles Unbeaten Garagorri</h3>
      <p>Dana White’s “Lookin’ for a Fight” alum <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ricardo-Ramos-121143">Ricardo Ramos</a> submitted <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Luiz-Eduardo-Garagorri-202081">Luiz Eduardo Garagorri</a> with a standing rear-naked choke in the first round of their featherweight encounter. The previously unbeaten Garagorri (13-1, 1-1 UFC) conceded defeat 3:57 into Round 1.<br/><br/>Ramos (14-2, 5-1 UFC) chewed up the Uruguay native’s leg with kicks, executed a takedown and transitioned to the back. Garagorri stood in a bid to free himself from the Brazilian’s clutches but exposed his neck instead. Ramos slid his arms into place, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/videos/recent/UFC-Sao-Paulo-Highlight-Video-Ricardo-Ramos-def-Luiz-Eduardo-Garagorri-14671">cinched the choke and forced the tapout</a>.<br/><br/>The submission was Ramos’ first in more than three years.</p>
      <h3>Ageless Trinaldo Decisions Green</h3>
      <p>Evolucao Thai standout <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Francisco-Trinaldo-31103">Francisco Trinaldo</a> posted his third win in five appearances, as he captured a unanimous decision over former <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/King-of-the-Cage-1">King of the Cage</a> champion <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Bobby-Green-27953">Bobby Green</a> in a three-round lightweight battle. Trinaldo (24-7, 14-6 UFC) carried all three scorecards: 30-27, 29-28 and 29-28.<br/><br/>Greene (24-10-1, 5-5-1 UFC) pestered the 41-year-old Brazilian with quick hands and slick head movement but failed to show much urgency. Trinaldo dropped him with a left hand in the first round, freed himself from a kimura and bit down on an attempted guillotine choke. Green did his best work in the middle stanza, where he mixed punches and kicks to the head and body. He delivered a pair of takedowns in Round 3 but did not consolidate them with damage or positional control, and a late volley of punches from Trinaldo appeared to seal the Californian’s fate.<br/><br/>Greene has lost back-to-back bouts.</p>
      <h3>Brown Triangle Submits Alves</h3>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ring-of-Combat-312">Ring of Combat</a> champion <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Randy-Brown-115641">Randy Brown</a> dispatched “The Ultimate Fighter Brazil” Season 3 winner <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Warlley-Alves-70750">Warlley Alves</a> with a triangle choke in the second round of their welterweight tilt. Alves (13-4, 7-4 UFC) bowed out 1:22 into Round 2, as he was submitted for the first time in his 17-fight career.<br/><br/>Brown (12-3, 6-3 UFC) wandered into immediate danger. Alves secured a pair of takedowns in the first round, sliced through his opponent’s guard and progressed to the back, at which point he transitioned from a neck crank to a rear-naked choke and appeared to be closing in on a finish of his own. Brown survived, extended the fight and answered a takedown from the Brazilian with a triangle early in the second round. He shifted position, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/videos/highlightreels/UFC-Sao-Paulo-Video-Highlights-Randy-Brown-Taps-Warlley-Alves-14669">adjusted the choke with his long legs and squeezed until the job was done</a>.<br/><br/>The 29-year-old Brown has won three of his last four bouts.</p>
      <h3>Silva de Andrade Dominates Diminished Barao</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Jungle-Fight-351">Jungle Fight</a> veteran <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Douglas-Silva-de-Andrade-87981">Douglas Silva de Andrade</a> won for the fourth time in six outings, as he cruised to a one-sided unanimous decision over the fading <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Renan-Barao-23156">Renan Barao</a> in a three-round pairing at 145 pounds. Scores were 30-27, 30-27 and 30-26, all for Silva de Andrade (26-3, 4-3 UFC).<br/><br/>Outside of a few takedowns, Barao (34-9, 9-8 UFC) was ineffective. Silva de Andrade attacked him with a wide variety of offensive weapons, from left hooks and right uppercuts to inside leg kicks and spinning back kicks to the body. He opened a cut above Barao’s left eyelid in the second round and sprawled out of takedowns in the latter stages of the fight. Silva de Andrade twice staggered his fellow Brazilian in Round 3, where he connected with an overhand right and a slashing standing elbow.<br/><br/>Once one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in the sport, Barao has lost five fights in a row.</p>
      <h3>Lipski Downs Replacement Padua</h3>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Konfrontacja-Sztuk-Walki-668">KSW</a> champion <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Ariane-Lipski-147487">Ariane Lipski</a> weathered significant adversity, closed the book on a two-fight losing streak and took a unanimous decision from <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Isabela-de-Padua-183333">Isabela de Padua</a> in a three-round women’s flyweight scrap. Lipski (12-5, 1-2 UFC) swept the scorecards with 30-26, 30-26 and 29-27 marks.<br/><br/>A short-notice substitution for <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Veronica-Macedo-180217">Veronica Macedo</a>, Padua (5-2, 0-1 UFC) was woefully outgunned on the feet but nevertheless had her chances. The 28-year-old newcomer executed multiple takedowns in the 15-minute confrontation and nearly cinched an inverted triangle choke at the end of the second round. However, her efforts were not nearly enough to erase Lipski’s work, which included a first-round knockdown and extended periods of ground-and-pound. The “Violence Queen” also benefitted from a point deduction in Round 2, where Padua was penalized for a blatant illegal upkick.<br/><br/>The loss snapped Padua’s run of consecutive wins at five.</p>
      <h3>Debuting Cortez Stymies Melo</h3>
      <p>Fight Ready prospect <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Tracy-Cortez-160955">Tracy Cortez</a> made a successful promotional debut, as she laid claim to a unanimous decision over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Vanessa-Melo-120777">Vanessa Melo</a> in a three-round women’s bantamweight affair. All three cageside judges scored it for Cortez (7-1, 1-0 UFC): 30-27, 30-27 and 29-28.<br/><br/>Melo (10-7, 0-2 UFC) countered effectively in spurts but failed to keep pace when her opponent switched gears. Cortez trapped the Brazilian in the clinch in the second round, then turned up the heat in the third. There, the <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Dana-Whites-Contender-Series-12411">Dana White’s Contender Series</a> alum executed a takedown, progressed to half guard and unleashed her ground-and-pound with increasing intensity. Had time not run out, a finish may have materialized.<br/><br/>Cortez has rattled off seven straight victories.</p>
