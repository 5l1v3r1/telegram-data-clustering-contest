      <p>Holland only need a draw to qualify for the Euro's, but<b> a win would take them to first place in their group</b>, after four wins in a row. </p>
      <p><b>Germany seem like they are not going to fail,</b> so it is up to the Dutch to look for this victory to round off the performance in the standings and confirm that the new squad of young players has a lot to say.</p>
