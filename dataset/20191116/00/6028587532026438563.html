      <p>The career of an optometrist is one that’s gaining some serious ground in the United States lately. Employment numbers have been increasing and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/optometrists.htm">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a>, employment of optometrists is projected to increase faster than average, with approximately 4,000 optometrist jobs being added from 2018 to 2028, an increase of roughly 10%. Using occupational data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we've analyzed and compiled a round-up of the average optometrist salary by state in the U.S. Read on for a full breakdown of where optometrists make the most money, and where they're making the least.</p>
      <h3>10 States Where Optometrists Earn the Most Money</h3>
      <p>The national average annual wage of an optometrist is $119,980, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm">BLS</a>, well above the e average annual salary for all occupations, $51,960. The average optometrist salary can vary significantly depending on the state. In the best-paying state for optometrists, the average salary is $55,110 more than the national average.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of the top-10 highest-paying states for optometrists.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>North Dakota average optometrist salary</b>: $175,090</li>
        <li><b>Vermont average optometrist salary</b>: $170,550</li>
        <li><b>Alaska average optometrist salary</b>: $165,640</li>
        <li><b>South Carolina</b> <b>average optometrist salary</b>: $142,290</li>
        <li><b>Massachusetts</b> <b>average optometrist salary</b>: $141,890</li>
        <li><b>Connecticut</b> <b>average optometrist salary</b>: $138,140</li>
        <li><b>Maine</b> <b>average optometrist salary</b>: $136,510</li>
        <li><b>North Carolina</b> <b>average optometrist salary</b>: $136,260</li>
        <li><b>Wyoming</b> <b>average optometrist salary</b>: $135,220</li>
        <li><b>Minnesota</b> <b>average optometrist salary</b>: $134,270</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It’s interesting to note that several of best-paying states also have a low supply of optometrists: No. 3 Alaska has the fewest, with only 70 optometrists; No. 9 Wyoming has 80; No. 2 Vermont has 90; No. 1 North Dakota has 160; and No. 7 Maine has only 170. This low supply combined with demand for such a fundamental medical service helps boost optometrist salaries in those states.</p>
