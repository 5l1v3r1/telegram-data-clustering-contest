        <b>Q: You’ve previously been the culinary host on a Globe South of France cruise. In your opinion, what makes Lyon a top culinary destination?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lyon is famously considered the gastronomic capital of France. It is a city of iconic names — Daniel Boulud is one of the city's famous sons, and it is home to the legendary Restaurant Paul Bocuse. What's more, Lyon has its unique culinary identity. Against the bistros of Paris, Lyon has its lively bouchons, and its own specialties, like the tender fish cakes called quenelles.</p>

        <b>Q: There are many types of excursions as part of the cruise. Are there any in particular that you are excited about?</b>
      </p>
      <p>On our itineraries, I'm of course excited for the culinary excursions, but also keep an eye out for any opportunity for tours that offer a first-hand look at history. Exploring the winding streets of Viviers, kayaking the breathtaking Ardèche, and the like. Visiting the Caverne du Pont-d'Arc , the replica of the Chauvet Cave, was a personal highlight from previous trips. The cave paintings depicted within are estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000 years old and are some of the best-preserved in the world. It is an immersive experience, encouraging one to comprehend the beginnings of human expression. It was truly moving.</p>

      <p><b>Q: There are also culinary experiences on board, like cooking classes and guest chefs. Can you tell us a bit more about what guests can expect on board</b>?</p>
      <p>On board the Scenic Sapphire, I often joke that it feels like all the best elements of summer camp. It’s convivial and collective. Since the ship is ours for our journey, passengers tend to hope for the same experience, are looking for the same sort of connections, with similar interests. The forums and classes are packed with enthusiastic discussion, with threads of thought built upon and extended as the trip progresses. I feel like there is an assumed commonality with fellow passengers; it is easy to pick up a conversation at breakfast or on deck, as we’ve all shared our days.</p>
