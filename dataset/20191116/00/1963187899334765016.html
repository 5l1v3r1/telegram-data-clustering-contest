      <p>CAIRO - 16 November 2019: Cairo International Airport received on Friday the first one-day trip by a Japanese tourist delegation coming from Port Said International Airport to visit archaeological and tourist attractions in Cairo. <br/><br/>A source told Egypt Today that the Japanese tourist delegation arrived on board of planes belong to the Petroleum Services Company PAS.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, Port Said International Airport is part of the Ministry of Civil Aviation's plan to develop Egyptian airports, upgrade efficiency and renovate infrastructure to provide the best service to passengers. <br/><br/>Egyptian coastal airports have seen an increase in operating rates this year compared to previous years especially after a number of countries resumed flights to Egyptian resorts. <br/><br/>In October 2019, the UK government announced it lifted flight restrictions to Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh, and no longer advises airlines against flying to the Red Sea resort's airport. <br/><br/>According to the UK government's statement, improvements in security procedures at the airport, and close co-operation between the UK and Egypt on aviation security, mean commercial airlines can now be allowed to operate routes to and from the airport. <br/><br/>“The UK has been clear that flights to Sharm El-Sheikh should resume when the security situation allows. I am pleased that today we can announce the lifting of the current restrictions. We will continue to work closely with our partners in Egypt and airlines that plan to resume flights in the future,” said Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Dr Andrew Murrison.</p>
