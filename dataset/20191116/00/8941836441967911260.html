      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Las Vegas police say four children ages 3-9 were in a home when a man fatally shot a woman and then himself.</p>
      <p>Lt. Ray Spencer said the shooting occurred Friday night after a domestic argument between the man and woman who Spencer said were in a relationship of some kind and who apparently lived at the home.</p>
      <p>Spencer said police didn’t immediately know the relationships between the adults and the children but said the children were “physically fine” and being reunited with “other biological parents.”</p>
