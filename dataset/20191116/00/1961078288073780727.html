      <h1>Prince Andrew Says He ‘Let the Side Down’ When He Stayed With Jeffrey Epstein</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:13:35+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:13</time> by <a rel="author">Megan Specia and Neil Vigdor</a></address>
      <p>LONDON — In a rare public moment of contrition for a member of Britain’s royal family, Prince Andrew said this week that it was wrong for him to have stayed at the Manhattan townhouse of Jeffrey Epstein after the financier had served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York was confronted about the 2010 visit to Mr. Epstein’s Upper East Side mansion during an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50431163">interview with the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>It followed the August <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7367511/Prince-Andrew-pictured-inside-paedophile-Jeffrey-Epsteins-63million-mansion-depravity.html">publication of photos</a> and video from Prince Andrew’s stay with Mr. Epstein, a convicted pedophile at the time, by The Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>“That’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family,” Prince Andrew, 59, said. “And we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, as simple as that.”</p>
      <p>The full interview is set to air Saturday night on BBC Two, which released excerpts from it on Friday.</p>
      <p>The second son of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Andrew has faced scrutiny for his ties to Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who faced a raft of sex trafficking and abuse charges before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-jail-officers.html?module=inline">taking his own life in August in a Manhattan jail cell</a>.</p>
      <p>The glare was so intense that it prompted Buckingham Palace to take the rare step of issuing a statement at the time of Mr. Epstein’s death in which Prince Andrew said he was “appalled” by the allegations against Mr. Epstein and rejected any suggestion that the prince would take part in the “exploitation of any human being.”</p>
      <p>While Prince Andrew expressed remorse in the interview over accepting Mr. Epstein’s invitation to stay with him, he denied allegations in a legal filing that Mr. Epstein lent one of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, to him for sex on several occasions when she was 17.</p>
      <p>“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady,” Prince Andrew said. “None whatsoever.”</p>
      <p>Emily Maitlis, the BBC journalist who sat down with Prince Andrew, said in a post on Twitter that it was a “no holds barred interview,” adding that none of the questions were vetted ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Exactly what the prince knew about the allegations against Mr. Epstein has been a point of contention in the months since the American businessman was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July. Prince Andrew has been accused of witnessing and taking part in the sexual exploitation of young women and girls during his decades-long friendship with Mr. Epstein.</p>
      <p>As details of Mr. Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse and trafficking of women were laid out, allegations of involvement by Prince Andrew began to emerge.</p>

      <p>In 2011, a photo was published that Ms. Giuffre said was taken in 2001 and showed Prince Andrew standing alongside her in a London apartment with his arm wrapped around her bare waist, with Mr. Epstein’s former girlfriend <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/ghislaine-maxwell-epstein.html?module=inline">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> standing in the background.</p>
      <p>Ms. Maxwell, a British socialite, has been named by many of Mr. Epstein’s accusers as an active participant in recruiting young women, some of them under the legal age of consent, for him to groom, traffic and exploit. She was also a friend of Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-hearing-victims.html?module=inline">an August hearing</a> in which many of Mr. Epstein’s accusers spoke publicly for the first time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/world/europe/prince-andrew-epstein-accuser.html?module=inline">Ms. Giuffre called on Prince Andrew to “come clean.”</a></p>
      <p>“He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it,” Ms. Giuffre said.</p>
      <p>Another woman, Johanna Sjoberg, said in unsealed legal filings in the same 2015 case that Prince Andrew posed for another photograph in 2001 touching her breast and touching Ms. Giuffre’s breast with a puppet of himself. The prince has repeatedly denied both allegations.</p>
      <p>Since Mr. Epstein’s death, lawyers for Mr. Epstein’s accusers have demanded that the prince provide a full account of his knowledge of the allegations.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew made a rare, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/24/world/europe/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein.html?module=inline">brief statement on the situation</a> in August, saying that he never saw or suspected any behavior involving the sexual trafficking and exploitation of underage girls during his long friendship with Mr. Epstein.</p>
      <p>“I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behavior,” he said. “At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.”</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said he first met Mr. Epstein in 1999 and the pair were photographed together several times after that. Investigations into accusations against Mr. Epstein began in 2005 in Florida, but more than a decade ago, Miami prosecutors made a secret deal with the financier that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty to two state prostitution charges. He spent about a year in a Florida jail.</p>
      <p>British tabloids have published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/world/europe/prince-andrew-epstein-video.html?module=inline">footage of Mr. Epstein and the prince</a> in New York that was said to have been taken in 2010, shortly after the financier’s release from prison. Prince Andrew has been widely criticized for apparently maintaining a relationship with Mr. Epstein after the sex crime conviction.</p>
