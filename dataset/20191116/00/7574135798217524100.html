      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/robert-forster-go-betweens-announces-first-north-american-solo-tour-in-10-years/">Robert Forster (of The Go-Betweens) @ The Bell House</a></b><br/>The Go-Betweens’ Robert Forster released Inferno earlier this year, which is one of his best-ever records. The album finds him comfortable in his skin and cult status and the songs are breezy, playful and, as always, thoughtful. This is his first NYC show in 10 years.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tool-expand-tour-did-you-get-tix/">Tool, Killing Joke @ Prudential Center</a></b><br/>Tool finally released their long-awaited first album in 13 years, <i>Fear Inoculum</i>, this year, and it rivals plenty of Tool’s classics and is one of of 2019’s best albums. They’re supporting it on an arena tour with post-punk/industrial legends Killing Joke, which hits Newark tonight and Brooklyn on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/taking-back-sunday-announce-2019-starland-ballroom-holiday-shows/">Taking Back Sunday, Errortype: 11 @ Terminal 5</a></b><br/>Taking Back Sunday’s 20th anniversary tour returns to Terminal 5 for a second night, and they’ll play their classic debut <i>Tell All Your Friends</i> in full, plus <i>Where You Want To Be</i> one night and <i>Louder Now</i> the other. Making these shows extra appealing is support from the back-in-action Errortype:11, who hailed from the same Long Island hardcore scene that helped birth TBS.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/jimmy-eat-world-announce-new-album-tour-share-all-the-way-stay/">Jimmy Eat World, pronoun @ Starland Ballroom</a></b><br/>Jimmy Eat World’s latest album <i>Surviving</i> was an exciting return to the vibrant catchiness of their <i>Bleed American</i> days, while still sounding like a fresh addition to their discography. They’ll head to Sayreville, NJ tonight, with killer support from singer-songwriter Pronoun.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/magnetic-fields-gothic-archies-future-bible-heroes-playing-stephin-merritt-nyc-residency/">The Magnetic Fields, Stephin Merritt @ Symphony Space</a></b><br/>Stephin Merritt kicks off his four-show Symphony Space residency tonight with an expanded lineup of Magnetic Fields playing songs from the last three decades, with a slight focus on <i>69 Love Songs</i> and <i>50 Song Memoir</i>.</p>
