        <b>Santi Cazorla celebrated a first Spain goal in four years and earned the praise of his head coach Robert Moreno.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spain coach <b>Robert Moreno</b> hailed <b>Santi Cazorla</b> as "exceptional" after the experienced midfielder scored his first international goal in four years.</p>
      <p><b>Villarreal playmaker Cazorla</b> has worked his way back into the <b>Spain </b>reckoning following his arduous and well-documented injury woes and was on target in the 7-0 <b>Euro 2020</b> qualifying thrashing of <b>Malta </b>in Cadiz.</p>
      <p>It was an evening in which <b>Spain's old guard</b> proved their worth amid debut goals for <b>Pau Torres</b> and <b>Dani Olmo</b>, with <b>Jesus Navas</b>, <b>Raul Albiol</b> and <b>Sergio Ramos</b> all impressing – a fact not lost on <b>Robert Moreno</b>.</p>
      <p>"What Santi's achieving, his form, after what he went through for nearly three years with his <b>terrible injury problems</b>, is exceptional," said the coach.</p>
      <p>"Without guys like him and <b>Raul</b> and <b>Sergio </b>it's hard to win tournament semi-finals and finals.</p>
      <p>"The contribution of people like <b>Santi</b>, <b>Sergio</b> and <b>Raul </b>– the generation who have already won tournaments – is <b>incalculable</b>. </p>
      <p>"They have such quality and it's hard to win tournaments without <b>their kind of experience</b>. They've accumulated things that they not only contribute in performance but transmit to others."</p>

      <p><b>Cazorla's strike</b> followed <b>Alvaro Morata's opener</b> before the floodgates opened in the second half with <b>Torres </b>and <b>Olmo's efforts</b> sandwiching <b>Pablo Sarabia's strike</b>, before <b>Gerard Moreno</b> and <b>Navas</b> rounded out the win.</p>
      <p><b>Robert Moreno</b> was impressed with the way his side kept the pressure on their vastly outclassed opponents.</p>
      <p>"The <b>gap </b>between 'big' international sides and so-called lesser nations <b>is closing</b> – it's very equal now across the board," he added. </p>
      <p>"We worked really hard on opening things up, on finishing, because we knew we wouldn't have it easy. Playing well like this and scoring lots of goals <b>is always very welcome</b>.</p>
      <p>"The easiest thing in the world would have been for my players to accept three or four-nil and drop their level. But we hit seven and <b>could easily have scored 10</b> – that says very good things about their mentality.</p>
      <p>"I note that the players are remembering what I told them the last time we were together and the time before that. We are apart for weeks or months but the momentum is <b>growing </b>so that they put into practice what I asked of them previously. That's good.</p>
      <p>"We think it's pretty historic that both <b>Pau </b>[Torres] and <b>Dani </b>[Olmo] both came on and scored with their first touch. It's been decades since two subs came on and scored on their debuts."</p>
