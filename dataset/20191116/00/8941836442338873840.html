      <p>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-anthony/">Cole Anthony</a> keeps scoring at a rate never before seen by a North Carolina freshman.</p>
      <p>As for the rest of the offense, well, the sixth-ranked Tar Heels are working on that part.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-anthony/">Anthony</a> scored 28 points to help UNC beat Gardner-Webb 77-61 on Friday night, though the game again offered uncertainty when it comes to who is capable of consistently stepping into the role of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-anthony/">Anthony</a>’s wingman.</p>

      <p>“You’re not going to know who’s going to come get you 15 or 20 points that game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-anthony/">Anthony</a> said. “Honestly I like it like that.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-anthony/">Anthony</a>, who had 34 points in the season-opening win against Notre Dame for an Atlantic Coast Conference record for a freshman debut, now has 82 points through his first three games - blowing past Rashad McCants’ previous mark by 19 points.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>He’s also the first UNC freshman to score at least 20 points in each of those first three games.</p>
      <p>On this night, the No. 2 producer was fellow freshman Armando Bacot inside with his first double-double (12 points and 11 rebounds). No other player scored in double figures and UNC (3-0) has had just two other players (Garrison Brooks and graduate transfer Justin Pierce) to score at least 10 in a game so far.</p>
      <p>Still, Pierce pointed to balance that included season highs of nine points for fellow graduate transfer Christian Keeling and Andrew Platek, along with eight for himself.</p>
      <p>“We’re a talented group and I don’t think there’s going to be a clear-cut No. 2 option, No. 3 option, No. 4 option, just because of the way each game flows,” Pierce said.</p>

        <p>Jose Perez scored 12 points for Gardner-Webb (0-3), which shot 37% and made 5 of 23 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>“I thought our mindset and our fight and our will to do the things we needed to defensively was there tonight, and that was great for us against a good team on the road,” Gardner-Webb coach Tim Craft said. “We just offensively struggled.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Gardner-Webb: The Runnin’ Bulldogs tenaciously hung in this one, staying within four points through the first half and then responding to the Tar Heels’ halftime-spanning run by getting to the foul line to keep the game from getting away. The problem is their own offensive troubles from the first two games (40.3% shooting) followed them to Chapel Hill and showed up when they were flirting with putting some pressure on the Tar Heels.</p>
        <p>“We fought back,” Craft said. “Man, we had chances late. If we could’ve just got a shot or two to go down.”</p>
        <p>UNC: The Tar Heels were coming out of a weeklong break since winning at UNC Wilmington in a game that left coach Roy Williams to lament: “We’re not a very good basketball team if we’ve only got three guys that can make a shot.” Things weren’t significantly better for stretches of Friday night, either, though they shot 50% after halftime to build a double-digit lead after leading just 30-27 at the break. The good news is help could come soon in the form of senior Brandon Robinson, who got in some warmup work as he nears his debut from a preseason ankle injury.</p>
        <p>ROOKIE MISTAKES</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-10 Bacot made 6 of 9 shots but also had three turnovers. He had the ball stripped away multiple times inside when he brought it down toward his waist with shorter defenders lurking to Williams’ chagrin.</p>
        <p>“It was just more like a way to power it up, kind of load up,” Bacot said. “But against those type of teams, I don’t really need to do that. I can just keep the ball high and finish it.”</p>
        <p>MORE ON <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-anthony/">ANTHONY</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-anthony/">Anthony</a> hit a huge 3-pointer over Nate Johnson to beat the shot clock at the 5:48 mark to put UNC up 10, one of several sequences that helped the Tar Heels keep the Runnin’ Bulldogs at arm’s distance. He also made 11 of 13 free throws.</p>
        <p>But he had just one rebound after becoming the only freshman in program history to go for at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in consecutive games.</p>
