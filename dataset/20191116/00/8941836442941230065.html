      <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - The University of Missouri-Kansas City says the removal of a controversial work of art from the school’s fine arts building display was long planned and not a response to complaints.</p>
      <p>The Kansas City Star reports the work is a statement on the current unrest in Hong Kong and features a depiction of an altered, torn Chinese flag, with yellow stars arranged to form a swastika. On the image is written “#CHINAZI.” The other half of the image depicts a yellow raincoat and gas mask with the words “FREE HONG KONG.”</p>
      <p>Chinese students complained Thursday to the art department and asked that the piece be removed.</p>
