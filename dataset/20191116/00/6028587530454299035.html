      <p>We now have two episodes of The Mandalorian released on Disney Plus, and the general consensus seems to be that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/15/why-are-we-getting-short-27-minute-episodes-of-the-mandalorian-on-disney-plus/">while short, they’re very, very good</a>. And it’s rare most Star Wars fans ever agree on anything. But one aspect of the show has inspired more debate and memes and appreciation than everything else. And even though it’s really the premise of the entire season, we can’t talk about it openly without getting into <b>spoiler territory</b>.</p>
      <p>So with that said, turn back now if you haven’t seen at least the first episode yet. And if you live in a country where Disney Plus isn’t arriving for months, well, you have a long, spoiler-avoiding road ahead of you, I’ll say that.</p>
      <p>I am talking of course about Baby Yoda, who ends up being the “fifty year-old” target that The Mandalorian was tasked to find by a former Imperial officer. We all have to call him Baby Yoda because Yoda’s species has no official name, and has been one of <i>Star Wars</i>’ greatest mysteries for its entire lifespan. But to be clear, this is not literally Yoda as a baby, The Mandalorian takes place after <i>Return of the Jedi,</i> when actual Yoda is dead and gone and a Force Ghost at best now.</p>

      <p>In yesterday’s episode, we saw more from Baby Yoda, and learned that he can both A) leave his little carrier and waddle around, making him even more adorable than usual and B) use pretty hefty force powers despite being so young. He lifts an entire space rhino in the air that’s about to kill The Mandalorian, allowing him to knife it and take its egg back to the Jawas. This causes him to pass out from mental exhaustion for what seems like a full day, making The Mandalorian wonder what the hell is going on with this thing.</p>
      <p>For fans? In general, everyone seems to be head over heels in love with Baby Yoda, with the common social media meme being that pretty much everyone would die for the little guy (girl?). The creature design, using practical puppet effects, has created a truly adorable creation, even as <i>Star Wars</i> has a hit or miss history with trying to create “cute” characters (the Ewoks are either beloved or despised, depending on who you ask). But those eyes, those ears, that little waddle and little “force claw raise” is just too cute.</p>
      <p>The vibe we’re now getting from <i>The Mandalorian</i> with this baby as the main crux of his mission is very <i>Lone Wolf and Cub</i>, though it’s getting increasingly difficult to talk about the series in public, because the mere existence of Baby Yoda is kind of a huge spoiler. It’s what Disney was keeping under wraps in the run-up to the release of the series, and it really was a big, surprising moment when you see the little guy for the first time.</p>
      <p>But the issue is that Baby Yoda is the entire thrust of the plot of the series, so if you’re posting about the show, you have to dance around it. Many people just don’t care and are opening tweeting their love of Baby Yoda so much that it’s actually become a trending hashtag on Twitter, so the cat’s sort of out of the bag on at least one social media platform. Again, there are a lot of places that don’t have access to Disney Plus for <i>months</i> still, and I would be amazed if they were able to avoid news of the arrival of Baby Yoda all this time if they’re online in any capacity. All it takes is seeing one of the above photos to ruin it. I’m at least trying to post spoiler warnings in my articles, but social media is a different animal.</p>
      <p>I am very excited to see the future of Baby Yoda on the show, as I doubt we will see The Mandalorian simply hand him over to the Imperials after being that cute and helpful and powerful, but we’ll know more next Friday. See you then.</p>
