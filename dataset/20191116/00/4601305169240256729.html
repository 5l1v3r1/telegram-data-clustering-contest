      <h1>Cautionary Tales: a new podcast that tells the intriguing stories of historical "mishaps, fiascos and disasters"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:38:18+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Economist, author, podcaster and radio presenter Tim Harford (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22tim%20harford%22">previously</a>) has a fantastic new podcast: <a href="http://timharford.com/articles/cautionarytales/">Cautionary Tales</a>, which Tim describes as "Eight stories of mishaps, fiascos and disasters - served with a twist of nerdy social science."</p>
      <p>I've just listened to the second episode, <a href="https://timharford.com/2019/11/cautionary-tales-ep-2-the-rogue-dressed-as-a-captain/">The Rogue Dressed As a Captain</a> (<a href="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/CAD2477245725.mp3">MP3</a>), which uses the story of the amazing con artist Wilhelm Voigt as a jumping off point for understanding the nuance of Hannah Arendt's "Eichmann in Jerusalem," the Milgram obedience experiment, and the way that frauds and cons work.</p>
      <p>The episodes feature full-cast dramatizations bookended by Harford's explanatory interludes -- they're really well done!</p>
