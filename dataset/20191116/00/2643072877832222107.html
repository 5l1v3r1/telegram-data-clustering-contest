      <p><b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/bukola-saraki/"><u>Bukola Saraki</u></a></b>, Former Senate President has reacted to the attack on the Oyo State Governor, Governor <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/seyi-makinde/"><u><b>Seyi Makinde</b></u></a>, in Kogi State yesterday.</p>
      <p>Recall Naija News had earlier reported that some gunmen arrived at the Suitorial Hotels, Lokoja, along Stadium Road, where the Governor and some members of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/pdp/"><u><b>PDP</b> </u></a>Campaign Council were lodged at about 12.50 p.m., shooting sporadically.</p>
      <p>Some hoodlums were said to have scaled the fence of the hotel and attempted to gain entrance.</p>
      <p>Reacting, Saraki called for peaceful and credible election as the people of Bayelsa and Kogi State go to cast their votes in governorship election today.</p>
      <p>Sariki through his Twitter page today wrote, “<i>Elections should not be a war, and political affiliations should never silence the voices of reason and peace. We must rise above party affiliations to roundly condemn the scale of violence we are seeing in Kogi State.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“There is no democratic victory borne through loss of lives as citizens strive to exercise their constitutional rights to elect the leaders of their choice. No one wins, only our beloved nation Nigeria loses.</i>
      </p>
      <p>“I call on those responsible for ensuring a safe and free election to do all it takes to see that today’s elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States are peaceful and credible, and not a scene of intimidation, violence and blood bath.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“May God guide and protect our fellow Nigerians in Kogi and Bayelsa States today.”</i>
