      <h1>Huawei to get a two-week license extension to work with US companies on Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=28" target="_blank">George</a></address>
      <p>In episode who's-still-counting in the US-China trade conflict, which appears to be hurting Huawei the most, the Chinese telecommunications company is set to get a two-week extension for its license to work with US companies, <i>Reuters</i> cites sources familiar with the matter. It's a short extension to the ongoing 90-day extension, which expires on Monday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_is_looking_at_another_extension_of_the_export_waiver-news-40118.php">a longer extension</a> is reportedly in the works, but is being held back by regulatory hurdles, hence the shorter extension. Naturally, no official source has confirmed these statements, with both sides denying to comment.</p>
      <p>Having decided that Huawei's business is a threat to the country's national security, the US put the company on <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_ban__winners_and_losers-news-37125.php">a trade blacklist in May</a>, essentially banning US companies from supplying the Chinese conglomerate with technology originating in the US. Subsequently, a general reprieve was issued and it was extended in August by three months, ending on Monday.</p>

      <p>Good news for Huawei has been coming in from several directions, including the resuming of business with <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/qualcomm_resumes_business_ties_with_huawei-news-39325.php">Qualcomm</a> and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/arm_will_work_with_huawei_again_technology_uk_origin-news-39827.php">ARM</a>, and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huaweis_q3_results_show_growing_revenues_and_smartphone_shipments-news-39656.php">growing sales</a> despite the trade war consequences have shown that not all is lost. Still, one major issue is yet to be resolved - the ban has meant that Huawei's latest phones have been unable to get licenses from Google, and although they still run Android, the lack of Google Play Services support is making them a hard sell in the Western world.</p>
