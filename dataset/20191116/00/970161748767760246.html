      <p>Children In Need managed to raise an amazing amount for charity tonight.</p>
      <p>The annual charity spectacular had managed to bring in a magnificent £47,886,382 at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>As ever, the money raised from tonight will go towards helping disadvantaged kids up and down the country – a very worthy cause indeed.</p>
      <p>Our hosts tonight were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tess-daly/">Tess Daly</a> and Ade Adepati, Mel Giedroyc and Graham Norton and couple Rochelle and Marvin Humes.</p>
      <p>There were some technical difficulties earlier in the night – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/children-in-need-host-ade-adepitan-apologises-for-technical-issues-as-child-violinist-cut-off-live-on-air-11165688/">host Ade apologised live on air after a segment</a> was cut short.</p>
      <p>As usual, stars from across the BBC all pitched in to help raise as much money as possible – from the cast of Doctor Who to the business moguls of Dragon’s Den.</p>

      <p>There was also the very special moment where <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/graham-norton-begs-mel-giedroyc-let-great-british-bake-off-go-children-need-11165907/">Graham Norton had to force co-host Mel to ‘let Bake Off go’</a> after the comedian couldn’t stop spouting Great British Bake Off-style innuendos.</p>

      <p>Viewers were also treated to a very special edition of Strictly Come Dancing, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/eastenders-maisie-smith-wins-children-in-needs-strictly-come-dancing-special-as-fans-beg-her-to-compete-for-real-11165825/">where the stars of EastEnders were competing for a bespoke Pudsey</a> version of the Glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>Partaking in a group number to the pop classic Dancing In The Street, the four Strictly judges did have to decide who would win.</p>
      <p>Maisie Smith – who plays Tiffany Butcher in the soap – managed to walk away with the charity trophy.</p>
      <p>Partnered with professional dancer Kevin Clifton, she said after her win: ‘I honestly had the most amazing week and I couldn’t have asked for a more wonderful team by my side.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been amazing.’</p>
      <p>After her win, fans were calling for the star to compete in the main version of Strictly next year – the campaign to get Maisie on to Strictly 2020 starts here!</p>
