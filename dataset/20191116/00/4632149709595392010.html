      <p><i>China calls the incident an ‘appalling attack’</i> <br/><br/>Police in London on Friday said they were investigating an assault after a Hong Kong minister fell to the ground as she was jostled by demonstrators. <br/><br/>China called the incident an “appalling attack”and urged London to provide better security. <br/><br/>Justice secretary Teresa Cheng had been due to give a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) in Bloomsbury Square, central London, on Thursday evening. But the CIArb said the event was cancelled because “whilst entering the building (Cheng) was assaulted by a crowd”. It added: “As a result she sustained an injury to her arm.” <br/><br/>Video of the incident circulating on social media shows Cheng being surrounded by jeering pro-democracy protesters, who followed her through the streets near the CIArb headquarters. She fell to the ground and was then escorted away.</p>
