      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:14:43+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>Regina’s city administration is pitching its lowest property tax hike in a decade, with officials recommending a mill rate increase of 3.25 per cent for the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>The $472-million general operating budget released on Friday is simply a proposal. Council will have the final say on Dec. 9 and 10. Mayor Michael Fougere wants to cut the tax hike to “well under three per cent.”</p>
      <p>“In a perfect world it would be zero,” he said.</p>
      <p>That hasn’t happened since 2009, and Fougere acknowledged council won’t get there. City Manager Chris Holden said the city is facing rising staffing and material costs that it needs to cover, otherwise it risks asset failure that could put the community at risk.</p>
      <p>“Although we are in a fairly difficult economic time, the mill rate is needed so that we can continue to maintain the level of service that we provide to citizens,” he said. “If we don’t have one, then it will mean a reduction in some services.”</p>
      <p>Fougere won’t accept any talk of service cuts. He said council will simply have to get “more creative” by finding ways to better target programs and get better value for tax dollars.</p>
      <p>Holden said he has already found about $3 million in savings by cutting back on management positions and the number of city departments.</p>
      <p>The proposal would increase expenses and revenue by $16 million, compared to 2019. Staffing costs make up the lion’s share of expenses. The budget foresees employment of 2,885 full-time equivalents in 2020, up 13 positions including four more police officers.</p>
      <p>The higher spending includes a $3.6 million boost for the Regina Police Service, which will now have $96 million at its disposal or about 20 per cent of the general fund budget.</p>
      <p>Other spending items include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$41 million for roadways and transportation;</li>
        <li>$40 million for transit;</li>
        <li>$44 million for Regina Fire &amp; Protective Services;</li>
        <li>$55 million for parks, recreation and culture programs;</li>
        <li>$24 million for garbage, recycling collection and waste management.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Taxation would fund 55 per cent of the total, slightly more than in 2019. Council has already endorsed a dedicated 0.5 percentage points of the proposed tax increase in order to pay for its Recreation Infrastructure Program. Another 0.45 per cent goes to the 10-year financing plan for Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>The average Regina homeowner with a property assessed at $350,000 would pay an additional $67.26 per year.</p>
      <p>Holden said administration was able to limit the hike due to a number of “unique revenue opportunities,” including a doubling of gas tax revenue from the federal government and higher revenue sharing payments from the province.</p>
      <p>“Those things are really what’s allowing us to put a lower middle rate than we would normally require,” he said.</p>
      <p>But federal policy is also costing the city more in fuel and power expenses. The budget foresees a $1.5 million expense increase due to the carbon tax.</p>
      <p>Next fall is election season for Fougere and the city’s 10 councillors. Fougere said that will be “part of the narrative” as council weighs in on the budget.</p>
      <p>Holden said the political calendar played no role as staff crafted the proposed budget.</p>
      <p>“There might be some question as to did we present the lower budget simply because it’s an election year,” Holden said. “And the answer from an administration is absolutely not. We created a budget that we believe best serves the needs of the community.”</p>
      <p>The higher gas tax revenue is enough to fund $12 million for rebuilding Maple Leaf and Wascana pools, according to Holden. The provincial government has refused to include those projects on a list for funding through a bilateral infrastructure deal.</p>
      <p>All told, administration is recommending $110 million of general fund capital spending on infrastructure. That includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$30.6 million for roads and streets;</li>
        <li>$8.8 million toward completing the Waste Management Centre;</li>
        <li>$3 million through the Recreation/Culture Capital Program to support improvements like spray pads and accessible playgrounds;</li>
        <li>$1.3 million for the Regent Par 3 golf redevelopment;</li>
        <li>$1 million for design work on the Ring Road Railroad Relocation Project.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The proposal includes another $70 million for water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure, as part of a $142 million utility fund budget.</p>
      <p>Utility bills are set to go up three per cent in 2020, a level that was already approved for a three-year period at the time of the last budget. That means a monthly increase of $4.14 compared to this year.</p>
      <p>But that estimate assumes the city’s lead service connection replacement program continues at its current funding level, despite Fougere’s commitment to bring forward a motion to pick up the pace.</p>
      <p>Administration said doubling the rate of line replacements from about 150 to about 300 per year would cost an additional $1.5 to $2 million.</p>
      <p>Fougere said council will discuss where to find the money at the end of the month. He wouldn’t commit to whether further increases to utility rates may or may not be on the table.</p>
      <p>“It’s a complicated conversation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Overall, Holden said the budget is about balancing affordability with quality services.</p>
      <p>“Nobody wants to see a tax increase,” he said. “Yet I think we all want to live in a city that is competitive, and to do that we need to increase taxes, we need to make investment.”</p>
      <p>“I feel fairly positive about this budget in terms of it being a reasonable mill rate increase.”</p>
