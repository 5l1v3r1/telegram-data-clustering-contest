      <p>After Yordan Alvarez won the 2019 American League Rookie of the Year award, fans went on the hunt to add his rookie card to their collections. With many Topps and Panini products on the market, this should be an easy target; however, there was one small problem, his rookie cards don't exist. In the eyes of the Major League Baseball Players Association, Alvarez has not been in the league long enough to earn the official rookie designation on his 2019 baseball cards. A quirky agreement between the MLBPA and the baseball card manufacturers has delayed Alvarez's "RC" branded cards until 2020. The MLBPA released an official statement via e-mail explaining why collectors will have to wait until next season to get their hands on rookies of the 2019 American League ROY.</p>
      <p>"To help establish a level playing field for baseball card licensees that are eager to produce the first rookie cards for emerging stars, we coordinate annually with manufacturers to establish a cutoff date for when players can be included in a licensed product. Yordan’s big-league debut came after the 2019 cutoff date."</p>
      <p>While the MLBPA did not allude to the specific date, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZowCardBreaks/status/1194115933591064581">one shrewd collector deduced that Tommy Edman's June 8th, 2019 debut was the line in the sand</a>. The St. Louis Cardinals rookie was included in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickdiunte/2019/11/09/2019-topps-update-baseball-ends-the-decade-with-a-history-making-rookie-card-set/">2019 Topps Update Baseball</a>, but Alvarez, who debuted the next day, was left out.</p>
      <p>When Topps released Alvarez's on-demand June 15th Topps NOW card celebrating his four-homer outburst, it did not have the anticipated “RC” logo but instead contained a “call-up” designation. This rookie card omission was a frustration point for many fans and collectors unaware of the MLBPA's agreement. However, this news did not come as a shock to all collectors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BigShep79/status/1194077213945024512">During the 2019 National Sports Collectors Convention</a>, Topps announced at their Q&amp;A session that the MLBPA sets the deadline for rookies to appear in current year releases.</p>
      <p>With the MLBPA publicly clarifying his absence, collectors can rest assured the baseball card manufactures were not withholding Alvarez until 2020 to generate early season interest. His 2020 branded rookies will give fans even more reason to anticipate a new decade of baseball card collecting.</p>
