      <p>"He has<b> a relentless natural enthusiasm</b>. Football seasons are long but right until the very end, Pep never seemed to be tired". </p>
      <p><b>"He was alert, always ready. </b>For the players, maybe this gave us an extra few metres in our legs when it mattered most."</p>
      <p>Alonso, who took over as <b>Real Sociedad B head coach</b> in June, also praised the work of Liverpool boss <b>Jurgen Klopp.</b></p>
      <p>The former Spain international, who played against Klopp's Borussia Dortmund side during his time at Madrid and Bayern, said: <b>"I didn't enjoy playing against them because they made it so intense,</b> you'd almost break".</p>
      <p>"It was like he wanted you to be in a cage.<b> He wanted to trap you</b>. There was an organised pressure. <b>I was under pressure all the time". </b></p>
      <p>"I enjoyed the mood around those games because they were so important but <b>the challenge of beating Dortmund was immense."</b></p>
