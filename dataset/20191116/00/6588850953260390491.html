The E-kiosk Concept is a Public-Private Partnership aimed at modernizing the operations of Lottery Business in Ghana. The E-kiosk currently under piloting is set to replace the old wooden Lotto Kiosks across the Country. The E-kiosk would offer services such as lottery products, banking, mobile money, receiving of remittance, payment of utilities, courier services as well as payment of television fees.<br/><br/>The E-kiosk project is also under partnership with Government Agencies such as One District one Factory Secretariat, NABCO Secretariat, Ghana Revenue Authority(GRA), Youth Employment Agency(YEA) and Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies.<br/><br/>Through the E-kiosk Project, the National Lottery Authority(NLA) has been able to successfully trained some selected NABCO beneficiaries on the Assembling of the E-Kiosk, Installation, Servicing and Maintenance of the E-kiosk.<br/><br/>b).

Beside these responsibilities, the Authority is mandated by Act 722 to pay monies to Central Government through the Consolidated Fund for national development.<br/><br/>3. *New Products through Collaboration*<br/><br/>The National Lottery Authority(NLA) through collaboration has introduced the following products to the Market:<br/><br/>a)NLA VAG 5/90 Lotto, in collaboration with the Veterans Administration Ghana(VAG) and Act 844.<br/><br/>b) Super 6 Dividend Game, in collaboration with the Private Sector.<br/><br/>c) Lucky 3 Dividend Game, in collaboration with the Private Sector.<br/><br/>Plans are far advanced to introduce the following Games hopefully before 31st December, 2019:<br/><br/>a) VAT Lottery, in collaboration with the Ghana Revenue Authority(GRA).<br/><br/>b) Otumfuo Scratch Cards and Raffle, in collaboration with the Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II and Manhyia Palace.<br/><br/>4. *Establishment of West African Lottery Authority*<br/><br/>As part of the efforts to achieve African Beyond Aid, Hon. Kofi Osei-Ameyaw has spearheaded the formation of the West African Lottery Association(WALA).<br/><br/>The West African Lottery Association(WALA) seeks to bring all Lottery Authorities in West Africa under one umbrella similar to the model of the World Lottery Association.<br/><br/>The Association aims to promote regional co-operation and partnership among member organizations. The West African Lottery Association also aimed at sharing International best practices among member organizations.<br/><br/>The leadership of Loterie Nationale de Cote d'Ivoire (LONACI) on behalf of the Ivorian Government expressed profound appreciation to Hon.
