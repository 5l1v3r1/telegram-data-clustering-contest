      <p>The body of a 27-year-old man was exhumed from a graveyard in Godhra Friday morning after his family approached the police suspecting that the deceased was murdered, police said.</p>
      <p>Sohaib Durvesh (27), a resident of the Signal Faliya area of Godhra, was found dead when his wife and parents tried to wake him up from sleep Tuesday morning. Considering it to be a natural death, the family buried him in the graveyard the same day.</p>
      <p>However, sources close to the family said that men who had helped dress him before the last rites later told his father Shaukat Durvesh (55) that they had found injury marks on his body. Suspicious about the cause of his death, Shaukat approached the police demanding a probe.</p>
      <p>His body was exhumed and sent for postmortem. Dr Sunil Bhatt on the panel told this newspaper, “There are injury marks but we are yet to ascertain how old are they and if they are the cause of his death. The exact cause of the death is yet to be ascertained. We will be able to say for sure in a day or two.”</p>
      <p>“We registered a case of accidental death after the family suspected that Sohaib could have been murdered. We will file a complaint of murder after we get a confirmation. The family too has not named anyone as suspects. We can only investigate the case after the postmortem report is provided to us,” said investigating officer, MP Pandaya.</p>
