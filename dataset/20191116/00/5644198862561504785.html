      <p>SAO PAULO: Red Bull's Alexander Albon set the pace in a damp first practice for the Brazilian Grand Prix on Friday before crashing into the tyre wall and bringing the session to a premature end.</p>
      <p>The British-born Thai rookie, confirmed earlier in the week by his team for 2020 alongside Dutch youngster Max Verstappen, lapped the Interlagos circuit with a best time of one minute 16.142 seconds on intermediate tyres.</p>

      <p>Albon then paid the price for switching to slicks on a drying track, the Thai bringing out the red flags with two and a half minutes remaining after skidding out near the still slippery last corner.</p>
      <p>Valtteri Bottas was second quickest for Mercedes, 0.551 slower, with team mate Lewis Hamilton one of four drivers who completed laps but without setting any times on a wet morning in Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>Mercedes and Hamilton have already wrapped up both championships, with Hamilton taking his sixth in Texas two weeks previously.</p>
      <p>Mercedes said there were no problems with Hamilton's car. The weekend forecast is for dry conditions, meaning that there was little to be gained from running in the wet.</p>
      <p>Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and team mate Charles Leclerc were third and fourth on the timesheets.</p>
      <p>Monegasque Leclerc, third in the championship, will have a 10-place grid penalty for Sunday's penultimate race of the season after an engine change.</p>
      <p>Verstappen, runner-up to Hamilton in Brazil last year after leading and then tangling with backmarker Esteban Ocon who had tried to unlap himself, failed to clock a time.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman, also trying out the slicks, spun through the Senna Esses without hitting anything just before Albon went off and reported conditions were still too slippery.</p>
      <p>"We're looking for some form of retribution from last year," Red Bull principal Christian Horner told Sky Sports F1 television.</p>
