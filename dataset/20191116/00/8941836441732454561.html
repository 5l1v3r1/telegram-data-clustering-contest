      <p>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) - Officials say a possible data breach may have compromised the personal information of more than 500 employees of a Virginia police department.</p>
      <p>Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler Jr. told the Washington Post that he doesn’t have any reports that officers’ personal information has been exploited.</p>
      <p>But the chief says he is concerned after learning that officers’ names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers may have been compromised by the potential breach at a neighboring police department.</p>

      <p>Roessler says the data was on a missing memory stick that contained the email inbox of the Purcellville police chief. Roessler said it wasn’t clear if there was a reason for the data to be in the other chief’s email or if Fairfax County also had a data breach.</p>
