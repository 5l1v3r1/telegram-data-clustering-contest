      <p>The Golden State Warriors have been dealt yet another blow as the organization reveals that D’Angelo Russell will miss at least two weeks after suffering a sprained thumb.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has injured the right thumb just weeks after returning to the court following an ankle sprain. In the ten games that he has played so far this season, Russell has averaged 24.3 points and 6.7 assists per game.</p>
      <p>Russell injured the thumb during their Friday night game against the Boston Celtics and an MRI revealed the sprain. Russell won’t travel with the team on their upcoming road trip.</p>
