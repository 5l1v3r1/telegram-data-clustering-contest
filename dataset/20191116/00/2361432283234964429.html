      <h1>Ridley Scott Revenge Tale 'The Last Duel' to Open Christmas 2020</h1>
      <h2>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck will write and star in Fox project</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:55:09+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/lawrence-yee/" target="_blank">Lawrence Yee</a></address>
      <p>Fox has dated Ridley Scott’s ‘The Last Duel’ — starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck — for limited release on Dec. 25, 2020. The revenge tale will open wide on Jan. 8, 2021.</p>
      <p>Set in 14th century, “The Last Duel” is about a woman who claims she’s been raped by her husband’s best friend. But when no one believes her accusation, her husband challenges his friend to a duel, the last legally sanctioned duel in the country’s history.</p>
      <p>Jodi Comer, who recently won the Emmy for Best Actress in a Drama for “Killing Eve,” <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jodie-comer-in-talks-for-ridley-scotts-the-last-duel-alongside-ben-affleck-and-matt-damon/">will play the female lead</a>. Damon and Affleck will portray the dueling friends.</p>

      <p>Damon and Affleck are reuniting to write the script along with Nicole Holofcener, an Oscar nominee for “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” They’ll base the script off of the non-fiction book “The Last Duel: A True Story of Crime, Scandal and Trial by Combat in Medieval France” by Eric Jager.</p>
      <p>Damon and Affleck’s Pearl Street Productions are also producing the project alongside Scott Free Productions. Scott last directed the story of the J. Paul Getty family kidnapping “All the Money in the World” from 2017.</p>
      <p>The project was previously announced but the studio confirmed it was greenlit Friday.</p>
      <p>Disney, which acquired Fox earlier this year, also dated Ben Affleck thriller “Deep Water” for Nov. 13, 2020.</p>

          <figcaption><b>Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil</b><br/>Adapted from 1959's "Sleeping Beauty,"  the first "Maleficent" helped re-energize <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/angelina_jolie/">Angelina Jolie's career</a> and introduced an entire generation to the tale's terrifying villain. Its sequel will hit theaters this week and will also star Ed Skrein, Michelle Pfeiffer and Elle Fanning. Joachim Rønning directs.<cite>Disney</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>Jungle Cruise<br/></b>Okay, okay, "Jungle Cruise" might not count as live-action based on a previously animated classic, but it is based on a ride at Disneyland, so we're going to include it. Plus, we'll take any chance to talk about Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in the same sentence. It will hit theaters in July 2020.<cite>Disney</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>The Little Mermaid <br/></b>So now we're getting into films that are in some stage of development but haven't necessarily been slated for release. After all, Disney has so many untitled films slated, it's hard to count. But a live-action version of "The Little Mermaid" has been long discussed, as it is arguably one of the most popular and profitable movies in Disney's vault. Rob Marshall is said to direct, with Halle Bailey set to star as Ariel and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula.<cite>Disney</cite></figcaption>

Heavy dramatist director <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/sam_mendes/">Sam Mendes</a> was attached to take a stab at it, but he has since dropped out.<cite>YouTube</cite></figcaption>

Disney and Vinson are collaborating on introducing the world to the sibling of the famous apple-loving princess. Disney released the original "Snow White" in 1937.<cite>Disney</cite></figcaption>
