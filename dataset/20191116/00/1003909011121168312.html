      <h1>Golf or skiing? Take your pick this weekend in Calgary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:21:14+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alanna Smith</a></address>
      <p>While some Calgarians are craving winter weather, others are savouring the last days of fall.</p>
      <p>WinSport’s ski and snowboard hill opened Friday, signalling the soon-to-be winter freeze Calgarians both celebrate and despise, while some golf courses across the city reopened to offer temporary greens for golfers a last chance to take a swing.</p>
      <p>“People can’t wait to get into the ski season but sometimes they can’t wait or can’t stop golfing,” said Dale Oviatt, spokesperson with WinSport, who said it’s typical of Calgarians to lean one way or the other.</p>
      <p>“The colder, the better for us. When it’s -5C that’s OK but -20C is awesome. As much as Calgarians hate it when it turns -20C overnight, we love it.”</p>
      <p>Oviatt said the organization is lucky to rely almost solely on artificial snow, rather than Mother Nature, so they’re able to open around mid-November every year. The main hill and all of the beginner areas are open so far and other parts of the facility will open as snowmaking permits.</p>

      <p>Their goal is to have everything open, including the Acura Tube Park, by Christmas.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, golfers in Calgary are enjoying what might be the final weekend before golf courses across the city close for the season.</p>
      <p>A handful of greens, including Silverwing Golf Course and the Fox Hollow Golf Course in the northeast, are open so long as the temperature stays above 0C.</p>
      <p>“Snow is always expected at this time of year, so if we can get four or five days of getting some golfers happy out there, we’ll take it,” said Greg Griffith, head pro at Silverwing, who said the forecast is promising as a handful of players were at the facility on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>He said the course traditionally opens on temporary greens, weather permitting, with no snow or ice soaking the course.</p>
      <p>In the new year, Calgarians and visitors alike will be able to enjoy a variety of events at WinSport, including World Cup freestyle moguls on Feb. 1 and skiing and snowboarding slopestyle and halfpipe events from Feb. 10 to 16.</p>
      <p>So, what will it be — winter loving or summer reminiscing?</p>
