      <p>Political thugs have clashed over the movement of voting materials to polling units in Otueke, Ngbia LGA of Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the incident happened at INEC’s Registration Area Centre (RAC) inside Community Secondary School, Otueke at 10.45 a.m.</p>
      <p>Thugs who were armed sent journalists and election observers scampering for safety.</p>
      <p>The angry youths had disagreed over the destination of a set of voting materials.</p>
      <p>An INEC official, who spoke with The Punch attributed the late distribution of voting materials to the stance of some of the youths in the community.</p>
      <p><i>“Blame the community youths for the late distribution of voting materials. The materials came in around 11.30 a.m., but the community youths insisted we should not move them,”</i> the INEC official stated.</p>
