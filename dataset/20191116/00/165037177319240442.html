        <b>Following his induction as Bayern Munich president, Herbert Hainer gave a warm endorsement of Pep Guardiola's managerial abilities.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Bayern Munich's new president has praised Pep Guardiola </b>and vowed the club will <b>target the best possible candidate</b> for the vacant head coach position.</p>
      <p>Herbert Hainer formally succeeded Uli Hoeness as president at Friday's AGM, assuming the role amid the search for a full-time replacement for Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p><b>Hansi Flick will continue in a caretaker capacity for at least the rest of 2019</b> while the Bundesliga champions weigh up their options.</p>
      <p><b>Guardiola - along with Erik ten Hag and Thomas Tuchel</b> - is one of three men being considered, according to Sport Bild, and Hainer has great respect for the Catalan, whose contract with Manchester City runs until 2021.</p>
      <p>"<b>The board of directors will try to get the best coach for Bayern Munich</b>," Hainer said, as quoted by Sport1.</p>

      <p>"When I say the best, it means, on one hand, a coach who we want to have and, on the other, one who is available.Â <b>Pep Guardiola is a great coach </b>but he has a contract with Manchester City. For now I would say, let's wait until the board comes to us. Then we will deal with the options. But in principle, we want to have the best coach at Bayern Munich."</p>
