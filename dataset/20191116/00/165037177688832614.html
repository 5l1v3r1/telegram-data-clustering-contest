        <b>The win against Malta was not expected to be such a trivial result. The 7-0 win was a milestone for Spain. It is the first time the Spanish national team have a won a game with seven different goalscorers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nobosy scored twice in <b>the thrashing over Malta.</b> From the<b> 13 players</b> that Robert Moreno used in the game,<b> seven of them scored </b>a goal. This is to say, more than half of the players with<b> real possibilities of scoring </b>(we know that goalkeepers can also score, but this is less likely) did so.</p>
      <p>It started with<b> Morata</b>, then <b>Cazorla, Pau, Sarabia, Dani Olmo and Gerard Moreno</b> and then finished with <b>Jesus Navas</b>. Seven goals from seven different goalscorers. An <b>unprecedented event</b> in the national team's football.</p>
      <p>A fact that did not go unnoticed by <b>Alexis Tamayi,</b> who did not take long to point out the historic event that had just occurred on the pitch at the <b>Ramon de Carranza</b> stadium on Friday night.</p>

      <p>Never has anything like this happened before, not even in<b> the historic 12-1 win</b> over Malta, one of the biggest thrashings in Spain's history. <b>It had never happened before.</b></p>
