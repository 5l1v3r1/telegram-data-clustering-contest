      <p>Pertinent issues which dominated the news during the week will be dissected by host Samson Anyenini Lardi together with his panel on Newsfile today.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Ken Ofori Atta on Wednesday, November 13 presented the 2020 Budget themed â€œConsolidating the gains for growth and prosperity for all.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ofori Atta while justifying the banking sector cleanup, disclosed that about 16.4 billion Ghana cedis was spent for the exercise.</p>
      <p>The highlight of the statement was, however, the omission of Volta regional road projects from the budget which was submitted by the Finance Minister.</p>
      <p>The incident which was described by the ministry as an error was quickly rectified and resent to Parliament after an uproar from the minority, fronted by MP for North Tongu and the Volta regional caucus.</p>
      <p>Another topic which made the headlines was on the upcoming referendum on December 17. Much of the build-up was on the position of the two main political divides who are on different pages of the exercise.</p>
      <p>While the incumbent party is propagating for a YES vote, the minority are advising for the opposite.</p>
      <p>An Afrobarometer report presented by the Ghana Centre for Democratic Development disclosed that about 42percent of Ghanaians are oblivious of the exercise.</p>
