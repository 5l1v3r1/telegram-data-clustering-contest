      <h1>Samsung updates its official site with support page for its next foldable device</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=39" target="_blank">Sagar</a></address>
      <p>Samsung announced its first foldable smartphone - <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_fold-9523.php">Galaxy Fold</a> - back in February, but the company <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_officially_launches_the_galaxy_fold_this_time_with_improved_design_and_construction-news-39035.php">reintroduced</a> it later in September with an improved design since the original version had its fair share of durability issues.</p>
      <p>There's no word from Samsung yet about the Galaxy Fold 2, but the company has updated its African site with a support page for SM-F700F, which is believed to be a foldable smartphone with clamshell design - similar to the freshly announced <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_2019-9630.php">Motorola Razr 2019</a>.</p>

      <p>The page doesn't reveal anything about the device, but we know that it's codenamed "Bloom" and is rumored to arrive shortly after the Galaxy S11. And now that Samsung has started adding its support pages to its official sites, more details about this foldable Galaxy are likely to surface in the coming weeks.</p>
