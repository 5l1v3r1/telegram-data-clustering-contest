      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 16 — The grande dame of R&amp;B is back with a new title on the soundtrack for <i>Queen &amp; Slim</i>, which has just been released.</p>
      <p>Lauryn Hill has yet to make up her mind to release a follow-up to <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill </i>which topped the charts two decades ago, however, fans of the neo-soul and R&amp;B album will be pleased with this latest track from <i>Queen &amp; Slim</i> by Melina Matsoukas.</p>
      <p>Blood Orange, Bilal, Mike Jones, Roy Ayers, and many others feature along with Hill on the soundtrack that also includes a track by Tiana Major9 and EarthGang, <i>Collide</i>, which dropped in October.</p>
      <p><i>Queen &amp; Slim</i>, directed by Melina Matsoukas (<i>Master of None, Insecure</i>), tells the tale of a couple played by Daniel Kaluuya (<i>Get Out</i>) and Jodie Turner-Smith (<i>The Neon Demon</i>), who are forced to go on the run when Kaluuya's character kills a police officer (played by Sturgill Simpson) in self-defence.</p>
      <p>Indya Moore, Chloe Sevigny and Flea also feature in the cast for the film, which is due for release on November 27. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
