      <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - A 20-year-old Kansas City man has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after a man was thrown from his pickup truck while it swerved on Interstate 435.</p>
      <p>Skylar Waddell is also charged with leaving the scene of an accident after the Wednesday death of 48-year-old Steven Norris.</p>
      <p>The Kansas City Star reports Norris’ wife told police her husband’s truck was on the shoulder of the interstate because it had a flat tire. When a man took off in the truck, Norris clung to the bed rail. He fell from the truck when it swerved into the median, struck the cable barrier and crashed.</p>
