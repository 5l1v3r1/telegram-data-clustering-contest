      <p>The Nats took Dunfermline Central from the Conservatives and held seats in Rosyth and Inverness Central.</p>
      <p>Curtice believes the SNP could benefit further as support for Labour crumbles north of the border — reflected in their poor showings in the three local ballots.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the first full week of General Election campaigning, Sir John said: “A slight question mark over the Conservatives, recent polls still had them down about seven points in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“But given they have been making some ground across the UK and there’s something of a Brexit Party vote to squeeze in Scotland, it would be surprising if they were not at risk of losing some of their seats.</p>
      <p>"The SNP look to be around 40 per cent, about three points up on where they were in 2017, so they are at least holding on, probably going up.”</p>
      <p>The Strathclyde University professor also believes Jeremy Corbyn’s perceived muddle over IndyRef2 policy is hurting support for Labour here.</p>
      <p>He said: “Unsurprisingly, given the state of the party’s polling position in the UK as a whole, they are well down in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“They are probably heading for aro­und 20 per cent of the vote, therefore down seven, eight or nine per cent.”</p>
      <p>Although the Nats won both Fife by-elections, sources within the party have admitted they <a href="http://bit.ly/3744Gg9">fear a Lib Dem surge</a> in the area.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson's party upped their support by over 13 per cent in Dunfermline.</p>
      <p>SNP's Stephen Gethins won North East Fife seat from the Lib Dems <a href="http://bit.ly/3744Gg9">by just TWO votes in 2017</a> - and some are <a href="http://bit.ly/3744Gg9">worried it might slip from their gras</a>p again.</p>
