      <p>Security personnel are reportedly preventing newsmen from covering the ongoing governorship election in Bayelsa state.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the Bayelsa State Governorship election is currently ongoing.</p>
      <p>In parts of Yenagoa, the state capital, soldiers and policemen denied accredited journalists and election observers vehicular movement despite explanation and identification.</p>
      <p>Asked by TheCable why the restriction, a soldier simply identified as Austin, said: <i>“that is the order”.</i></p>
      <p>Residents have also complained about the delay in starting the voting process.</p>
      <p>In some parts of the town visited by TheCable, INEC officials and election materials were not on ground while voters were stranded.</p>
      <p>A resident, who simply identified himself as Obi expressed concern that <i>“the election may not hold in some areas as INEC is not around”.</i></p>
      <p><i>“You can see there is nothing here, it’s not even looking like election is holding. They may not conduct it,”</i> he said.</p>
