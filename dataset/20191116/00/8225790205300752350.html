      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - The official start of winter is just over a month away, but you wouldn’t know it in the islands.</p>
      <p>The state continues to rack up heat records during what National Weather Service forecasters have described as a “seemingly unprecedented” year of high temperatures.</p>
      <p>From Jan. 1 through Friday, Hawaii has set or tied 281 record high temperatures at official Weather Service stations located at four island airports ― in Honolulu, Hilo, Lihue and Kahului.</p>
      <p>Of those, 141 have been new heat records.</p>

      <p>Forecasters are still trying to determine if this year has been the hottest on record in Hawaii.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the records just keep coming.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the mercury hit 88 in Hilo, breaking the old record for the day of 87 degrees (set in 1996). Kahului got to 90 degrees, tying a record made in 1991.</p>
      <p>This summer, the state experienced blistering conditions with highs in the mid-90s.</p>
      <p>Scientists say a marine heat wave in the Pacific ― <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2019/10/17/marine-heat-waves-like-one-behind-hawaiis-sweltering-summer-poised-become-new-normal/">the second-largest ever recorded</a> ― is largely to blame for the avalanche of record highs.</p>
