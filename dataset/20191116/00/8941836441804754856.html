      <p>“What I say to you young people: Be courageous; aim high; we need you more than ever; be kind to one another along the way; be dogged,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/neil-m-gorsuch/">Justice Gorsuch</a> said. “And be not afraid, as Justice Kavanaugh said, be not afraid. Because guess what? They can throw their slings and arrows, and I’m still here.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/neil-m-gorsuch/">Justice Gorsuch</a> sat onstage alongside his former clerks David Feder and Jane Nitze to discuss his new book that he co-authored with his former clerks, “A Republic, If You Can Keep It.” In conversation with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federalist-society/">Federalist Society</a> executive vice president Leonard Leo, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/neil-m-gorsuch/">Justice Gorsuch</a> said it was important for the nation’s leaders to learn to disagree without viewing their opponents as evil.</p>

      <p>“I do think effective lawyering does not mean you hate your adversary,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/neil-m-gorsuch/">Justice Gorsuch</a> said. “And I think the same thing is true for [statecraft] and the… people who run this country in jobs like we all have now.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/neil-m-gorsuch/">Justice Gorsuch</a> pointed to disagreements he has with Justice Clarence Thomas, and noted that originalists do not always agree on matters of the law and of judicial outcomes.</p>
      <p>“Justice Thomas and I have disagreed for example on vagueness doctrine, we’ve disagreed on the appointment of non-Article III judges to take away intellectual property rights, but that’s because we’re disagreeing about how we’re reading history,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/neil-m-gorsuch/">Justice Gorsuch</a> said. “And I think those are great and good-faith disputes for judges to have.”</p>
