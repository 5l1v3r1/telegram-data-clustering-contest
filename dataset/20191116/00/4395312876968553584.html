      <p>Because of you, someone knows they matter too. Because of you, someone is smiling too. Because of you, someone knows they are someone too. Because your smile makes someone smile too.</p>
      <p>Your smile is also for you. To remember how you matter. How you are someone. How your smile is for you too. To remember how your smile is a reason to smile for simply being who you are. Who you have always been too.</p>
