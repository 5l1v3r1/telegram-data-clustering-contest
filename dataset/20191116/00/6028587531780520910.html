      <p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about how the audio industry has dramatically changed since the advent of digital technology. In the days before digital, you could buy a piece of audio kit – such as an amplifier, turntable or receiver – and expect it to provide many years of faithful service. Indeed, the market for old-school receivers from the likes of Pioneer and Marantz has never been more buoyant. These old receivers fetch huge money on eBay and often they only require “recapping” with new capacitors and maybe a power transistor or two, and then they’re good for another 20 or 30 years of musical enjoyment.However, it’s a different story when it comes to more modern audio gear. You can get firmware upgrades for digital receivers but with the market changing so fast and some manufacturers falling by the wayside, there’s no guarantee your investment will always be updated. Technology advances so fast, before you know it, your new digital streaming amplifier has an outdated Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) and you find yourself hankering after an upgrade to something better. In some respects, the audio market shares some similarities with the digital camera market. That 6-megapixel Nikon D50 DSLR you bought 12 years ago now looks primitive compared alongside the latest 24-megapixel model. It’s such a shame you can’t upgrade the sensor in your camera or fit a better DAC in your streaming amplifier. </p>

      <p>In an age of increasing environmental consciousness, we need to rethink the idea that electronic equipment should be upgraded every few years or so. We have to find better ways of prolonging the life of audio equipment and making it repairable rather than having to scrap and replace. This is a mantra that the classic US audio marque McIntosh has taken seriously. McIntosh equipment doesn’t come at bargain-basement prices. If you’re investing $6,000 in a streaming amplifier, you don’t want to have to junk it after five years or have to sell it with a massive price drop.</p>
      <p>Several McIntosh integrated amplifiers can have their DACs upgraded with a new digital module, saving them from obsolescence. For example, the MA9000, MA8900, MA7200, and MA5300 Integrated Amplifiers; MAC7200 Receiver; and C49 Preamplifier from McIntosh all have DA1 digital modules that are upgradable to the new DA2 Digital Audio Module. This upgrade is McIntosh’s latest and most advanced module for processing digital audio, and it’s fitted as standard in the McIntosh’s C53 and C2700 Preamplifiers, enabling both of those units to take advantage of the latest innovations in digital audio technology. </p>

      <p>The DA2 Digital Audio Module builds upon the DA1 module and has an expanded set of features. The original DA1 has two optical digital inputs, two coaxial inputs, plus a USB A port for connecting a Mac or PC. In addition to having the same inputs as the DA1, the new DA2 also includes an audio-only HDMI input with Audio Return Channel (ARC). This enables the unit to be connected to any TV with a compatible HDMI (ARC) output, routing the TV’s audio output to a home stereo system and providing interoperability with the TV’s remote control for adjusting or muting the sound.</p>
      <p>In addition to the standard inputs, the DA2’s USB input is now able to support native playback of digital music files up to DSD512, surpassing the DSD256 limit of the DA1. This increased DSD playback support is thanks to the latest Quad Balanced, 8-channel, 32-bit DAC at the heart of the DA2. It’s an audiophile-grade DAC and McIntosh claims it has an improved dynamic range and reduced total harmonic distortion compared to the unit used in the DA1 module. </p>

      <p>And now the bad news, due to the technical nature of the DA2 upgrade, the host unit has to be returned to an Authorized McIntosh Dealer or Authorized McIntosh Service Agency for the work to be carried out. If anyone else performs the upgrade, the warranty on the host unit becomes invalidated. That’s a shame as it doesn’t look that difficult to do a swap out, but if you’re the type who can afford to buy McIntosh gear, this return policy probably won’t bother you.</p>
      <p>This move by McIntosh is to be applauded. If only more consumer electronics could be easily repaired or upgraded there would be a lot less electronic waste going into landfill sites. We need to think much more carefully about the environmental impact of our gadgets and entertainment devices on the environment. Constant upgrading may be good for the consumer electronics business but it’s not so good for our planet. </p>
      <p><b>Price and availability:</b> The McIntosh DA2 Upgrade Kit has an MSRP of $1,000 and shipping is expected to begin in November 2019.</p>
