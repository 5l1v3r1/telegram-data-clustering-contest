      <p>The WWE was at the Wells Fargo Arena in Philadelphia on Friday for Smackdown, and fans were served a hit-and-miss episode as we head into Survivor Series week. The NXT Invasion continued, which was good, but there were some other less entertaining segments. We did see the new-look Universal title which has been branded with a blue strap for Smackdown.</p>
      <p>Here are my takeaways from Friday’s episode.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Corbin vs. Roman Reigns Is Boring And Uninspired</b>
      </p>
      <p>WWE seems to be afraid to elevate Roman Reigns back to a Universal Championship level. Prior to his cancer diagnosis and absence, fans were pelting him with boos on sight and completely no-selling any concept that saw the Big Dog in a title hunt.</p>
      <p>He is over once again as a face, and as popular as ever with the younger demographic. However, the promotion is being extremely careful with his booking. He’s enthralled with a feud with Baron Corbin and quite honestly, it’s not very interesting.</p>
      <p>Corbin, Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode taunted Reigns with insults and paraded out someone in a dog costume to mock the former Shield member. It was pretty corny and only good for a smirk, at best.</p>
      <p>Here is to hoping this whole thing is over soon and Reigns can be included in something a little less safe and a lot more entertaining.</p>
      <h3>Grade: C-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Mustapha Ali and Shorty G Put On Solid Match With Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode</b>
      </p>
      <p>There were too many strong workers in this tag-team match to produce poor action. The two tag teams delivered a solid match as it gave WWE a reason to parade Reigns to the ring to confront his current rival.</p>
      <p>Were it not for the in-ring work, this might have been just another ho-hum segment in the aforementioned feud.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Braun Strowman is Still in a World of Nonsensical Angles</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve said this before, and every time Braun Strowman is included in something silly, I’ll say it again: he is one of the most inappropriately utilized talents to come through the WWE’s ranks in a long while.</p>
      <p>The Monster Among Men beat up Drew Gulak, and The B-Team before we were all spared more silliness. Strowman’s best years are going to waste.</p>
      <h3>Grade: D</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Excellent Invasion Segment</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Undisputed Era interrupted the New Day’s Smackdown Tag-Team title defense against The Revival. Normally that would be a concept I hated, but the NXT Invasion is the best thing smoking for WWE at the moment, and UE is money on screen.</p>
      <p>The attack led to the emptying of the Smackdown locker room and continues to add strong layers to the upcoming Survivor Series pay-per-view.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Heavy Machinery Needs Something That Matters</b>
      </p>
      <p>I really like Heavy Machinery and I feel they are worthy of a legitimate run as tag-team champions. Therefore, it is hard to accept matches between the beefy duo and a pair of enhancement talents by the names of Kip Stevens and Kevin Timms.</p>
      <p>Heavy Machinery squashed the two guys and I wish I’d have gone to the refrigerator on this segment.</p>
      <h3>Grade: C-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Rhea Ripley is a Superstar</b>
      </p>
      <p>The match began as a battle between Nikki Cross and Bayley, but it morphed into a Smackdown vs. NXT extravaganza. There were solid talents throughout this 8-woman tag match, but I couldn’t take my eyes off Rhea Ripley. She’s like the female version of Drew McIntyre, only with a touch more natural magnetism.</p>
      <p>Ripley is the kind of presence who could dwarf most other female stars physically and as it pertains to presence. Nikki Cross got the win for the Blue brand, but that didn’t take the shine away from the segment’s truest star.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B-</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Daniel Bryan and Bray Wyatt Work Some Magic</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love when there is a feud and heat that actually makes sense. Why would WWE Universal Champion Bray Wyatt target Daniel Bryan for an attack last week? It’s simple, he is seeking revenge for Bryan’s less than genuine stint with the Wyatt Family back in 2014.</p>
      <p>That’s as strong of a motivation as you’ll find in the world of professional wrestling. The two men delivered excellent energy as part of an episode of Miz TV. Bray accepted Bryan’s challenge for the Universal title for Survivor Series.</p>
      <h3>Grade: B+</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Show Grade: C</h3>
      <p>Stay tuned for more WWE coverage next week when Raw’s going home precedes NXT and the highly anticipated WWE Backstage with the return of CM Punk.</p>
