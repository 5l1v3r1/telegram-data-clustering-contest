      <h1>Western Canada: The election bluster is over, but the spat between Kenney and Blanchet is not</h1>

      <p>Good morning! It’s James Keller in Calgary.</p>
      <p>Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has spent his six months in office (and the election campaign before that) making Quebec one of his many targets.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kenney has slammed the Quebec government and the leader of the Bloc Québécois for objecting to oil pipelines while the province benefits from large equalization payments. He’s called out what he sees as hypocrisy because those equalization payments are funded in part by Albertans’ resource wealth, through income taxes. And he’s accused the province of being all too eager to take oil from “OPEC dictators” rather than Canadian crude.</p>
      <p>The animosity ratcheted up during the federal election campaign and it’s only got more heated since then.</p>
      <p>This past week, Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet said <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-bloc-quebecois-says-it-will-not-help-western-provinces-in-dispute-with/">his party would not help the governments of Saskatchewan and Alberta </a>in their fight with Ottawa, even as Alberta demands a level of autonomy that in some ways would mirror the situation in Quebec. He also said his province already has enough oil and he doesn’t see the need to help bring more Alberta crude to the east.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kenney snapped back, accusing Quebec of biting the hand that feeds it: “You cannot have your cake and eat it, too. Pick a lane." He’s using Mr. Blanchet’s dismissive attitude as fodder for his push for a more autonomous Alberta. Mr. Kenney has called for a “fair deal” for his province that could include an Alberta Pension Plan, a provincial police force, a provincial revenue agency and a number of other measures.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, Mr. Kenney said Mr. Blanchet and his sovereigntist allies cannot continue to denounce Alberta oil even as the Quebec government receives billions of dollars in equalization payments. While the funding comes from Ottawa, Mr. Kenney argues a large part of the money was generated by the oil industry.</p>
      <p>Our Calgary-based columnist Kelly Cryderman <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-kenney-and-blanchets-pipeline-squabble-could-soon-be-outdated-as-oil/">argues Mr. Blanchet’s opposition is self-defeating and outdated</a>. Quebec already gets a significant amount of oil from Alberta through existing pipelines and there’s demand to ship more oil east for export out of Montreal. Opposing pipelines won’t stop that, but simply increase shipments by rail: “To be clear, Quebec politicians are not saying no to Alberta oil. They are saying no to Alberta shipping oil through the province to get to international markets.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-rank-hypocrisy-of-quebec-politicians/">Gary Mason writes that Mr. Blanchet’s approach</a> to Alberta is blatant hypocrisy. And it’s not just equalization; Quebec gets nearly half of its oil supply from Western Canada: “Imagine what would happen if Alberta cut off that supply tomorrow. What would happen in Quebec? Let’s hope we never have to find out.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-when-it-comes-to-national-unity-yves-francois-blanchet-is-not-here-to/">Campbell Clark says the whole dispute is further damaging national unity</a> (and we shouldn’t be surprised that Mr. Blanchet doesn’t appear too concerned): “The whole dispute is ripe for all sides to take offence, for one province to fire blame at another. But [Quebec Premier François Legault] hasn’t deputized Mr. Blanchet to speak for Quebec. And when he shoots off his mouth, Mr. Kenney should not treat the Bloc leader as he does. Because he’s not rooting for Canadian unity.”</p>

      <p><b>HOMELESSNESS TARGETED: </b>B.C. municipalities have been passing <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-municipalities-pass-bylaws-targeting-homeless/">a series of bylaws</a> targeting activities usually associated with being homeless.

        <b>Opinion:</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-how-many-pipelines-do-we-really-need/"><b>Gary Mason</b></a><b> on pipelines: “</b>Given how long it takes to get a pipeline built in Canada, does it make any sense to be planning more, to be dreaming of something that might not be built for seven, eight, nine years? That might be coming onstream as demand has plateaued or has started to contract at an inexorable rate?”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-a-forgotten-1970s-experiment-can-teach-us-about-todays-overdose/"><b>Shawney Cohen</b></a><b> on the drug war:</b> “The Rat Park experiment involved rats, but the bigger message for the rest of the world is that without shifting our perspective on drug policies and focusing more on the environments in which we live and want to build, the futile drug war will only continue.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-whats-missing-from-bcs-climate-change-legislation/"><b>Karen Tam Wu</b></a><b> on B.C.’s climate change legislation: “</b>B.C.’s climate accountability and transparency legislation is a near-complete framework for moving from climate promises to performance. A minority federal government committed to climate action would do well to follow B.C.’s lead and act quickly to insulate climate targets against the vagaries and vulnerabilities of politics before it’s too late.”</p>
