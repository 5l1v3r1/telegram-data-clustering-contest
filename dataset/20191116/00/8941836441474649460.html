      <p>LOGAN, Utah (AP) - Alphonso Anderson had 21 points, six rebounds and three assists and Justin Bean added 18 points, 10 rebounds and three assists to help No. 17 Utah State beat North Carolina A&amp;T; 81-54 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“I thought we did some really good things,” Utah State coach Craig Smith said. “I thought we did a great job on the glass, outrebounding them 44-28, held them to 35% on the game, and 22 assists on 29 made baskets.”</p>
      <p>Ronald Jackson led North Carolina A&amp;T; with 15 points.</p>

      <p>“I thought we went toe-to-toe with a very, very, very good program for maybe 30-31 minutes and then talent started to take over,” North Carolina A&amp;T; coach Jay Joyner said.</p>
      <p>With North Carolina A&amp;T; (1-3) rallying in the second half, Utah State (4-0) made a key run to pull away.</p>

      <p>After trailing by as much as 15 points, North Carolina A&amp;T; cut it to six points on Fred Cleveland’s 3-pointer with 14:03 left. Utah State regrouped and went on a 9-0 run over the next two minutes to make it 51-36. Utah State took advantage of three North Carolina A&amp;T; turnovers, with Bean scoring five of the Aggies’ nine points.</p>
      <p>“In the second half, when we had that lineup of small ball creating mismatches and scoring at will, I think that really helped us to extend our lead,” Bean said.</p>
      <p>For the third straight game, Utah State raced to a big lead, getting out to a 12-2 advantage. North Carolina A&amp;T; rallied through the first half to climb within eight points on Tyler Maye’s jumper.</p>
