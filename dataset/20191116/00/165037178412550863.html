        <b>The Italian press assure that Torino are thinking about signing the Milan forward Fabio Borini in January, but they have a problem: they already have two players in that position, Simone Zaza and Iago Falqué. One of them must leave so that Borini can join.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's the typical bottleneck situation. Torino have enough attacking options, <b>but it isn't working</b>. That's why they have cast their nets on <b>Fabio Borini</b>.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old attacker's contract ends in 6 months, and Milan don't intend to renew it, so this is the last option for the club to get money for a player they paid 5.5 million for in 2017.</p>

      <p>Milan could try to exploit Torino's need, and according to the 'Corriere dell Sport', <b>Torino would be willing to pay a big fee</b> for Borini, but with a condition.</p>
      <p>In order to fit the Milan player into their squad, <b>Torino</b> have to make room for him. Simone Zaza and Iago Falqué are the most likely to leave the club in January.</p>
      <p><b>Zaza has scored 5 goals in 15 games so far this season</b>, whereas<b> Iago Falqué</b>, a player with more similar characteristics to Borini, still hasn't got off the mark and<b> has only played 5 matches</b>.</p>
