      <p>Chauncey Hawkins scored 16 points to lead St. Francis Brooklyn (1-3). Rob Higgins added 12 points for the Terriers, who dropped to 0-3 on the road.</p>
      <p>N.C. State delivered scoring runs of 9-0 and 12-0 in the first nine minutes of the second half to pull away.</p>

      <p>The Terriers had eight turnovers during that span, leading to 17 points for the Wolfpack.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>St. Francis Brooklyn: The Terriers hung tough for a half, trailing only 44-34 at halftime despite shooting 36 percent, making 1 of 8 3-point tries and committing 10 turnovers. They stayed close thanks to dogged determination on the glass, where they turned 12 offensive rebounds into 11 second-chance points.</p>
      <p>N.C. State: The Wolfpack scored more than 80 points for the fourth time in as many contests, but they still haven’t put together a complete game. The good news for N.C. State is that it was able to shake off its rebounding and turnover problems from the first half and play a much cleaner game after halftime.</p>
