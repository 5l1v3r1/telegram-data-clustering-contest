        <b>Former Brazil player and 1999 Ballon d'Or winner, Rivaldo, criticised Tite for the decision to award the number '10' to Paqueta during the match against Argentina.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Barcelona player showed his disagreement with the coach's measures, as he thinks thats the decision could<b> "burn the 22-year-old player". </b>The Brazilian spoke about everything this meant <b>on a social media post.</b></p>
      <p><b>"I saw the game and I made me very sad to see what happened with the Brazil number '10' shirt.</b> They gave it to Paqueta against Argentina. It is a shirt that is respected all over the world," he started explaining.</p>

      <p>"This one is not meant to be on the bench or go off at half time. It was used and honoured by Pele, Rivelino, Zico, Rivaldo, Kaka, Ronaldinho and Neymar. <b>It is not the player's fault</b>, it's the coach's becaise they know the weight that this shirt carries", he added.</p>
      <p>Finally,  he ended his criticism by referring to the care being taken with<b> Rodrygo</b>: "In the same way that you want to protect him, who is doing very well at Real Madrid,<b> you could have protected Paquetá from playing in that shirt".</b></p>
