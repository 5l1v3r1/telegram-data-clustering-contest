      <p>We may have just seen the release of Pokémon Gen 8 with Sword and Shield this week, but Pokémon GO is still only halfway there, with the Gen 4 Pokedex out there and Gen 5 starting to be added to the game recently.For Community Day, that means a day of catching Gen 4 started Chimchar, the fiery ape that evolves into Monferno, then Infernape. He’s actually one of my favorite non-Gen 1 starters out there, so I’m happy this day has arrived at last.</p>
      <p>Pokémon GO’s Community Day runs from 11 AM to 2 PM local time today, where Chimchar spawns will be everywhere. And while the bonus is the coveted Blast Burn move for Infernape, the goal for many players will be to get a three-hour only, truly rare specimen with a shiny, Blast Burn Infernape.</p>
      <p>Shiny Infernape, like his previous two evolutions has darker pink-ish skin that makes him one of the better shinies we’ve gotten access to in a while, as the color difference is hugely noticeable. Even the fire on his head changes color to be more pink as well.</p>
      <p>To find one, you are going to have to play the odds, as ever. On Community Day, that means you’re probably going to see somewhere between a 5-8% spawn rate for shiny Chimchars, meaning 1 in 20 or 1 in 15 might be a shiny.</p>
      <p>To increase those odds, make sure you are taking advantage of the three hour lures going on during the event, and if there was ever a time to spray incense, that would be today as well, as it does attract more Chimchar at increased rates, as it does with all Community Day Pokémon. Then you just have to get lucky and see if you can land a strong IV shiny before the event ends. After that, take up all the candy you’ve gotten and make sure to evolve your new, shiny Infernape before the event ends in order to get it Blast Burn. You will quite literally never have this chance again, and not only will Blast Burn be going away, but shiny Chimchar will then become much, much more rare to find. So don’t miss out on this opportunity.</p>
      <p>Community Days continue to be one of the most successful things GO has ever done, though we are now heading into the “un-fun” season where it starts getting pretty cold in most places so walking around outside catching Pokémon is less appealing. But brave the cold, get them Chimchar. See you out there. Shivering.</p>
