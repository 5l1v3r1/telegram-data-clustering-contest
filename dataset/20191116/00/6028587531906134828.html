      <p>Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific announced enhancements to the amenities in its much-lauded first- and business-class cabins today including new wellness menus, tableware and refreshed bedding. The overall guiding principle was “a sense of harmony” to create a “more bespoke, sensory journey” with the airline.<b>First rate first class</b></p>

      <p>Cathay Pacific first class is already one of the most sought-after experiences in the skies thanks to double-wide seats that transform into lie-flat beds, personalized service, and excellent catering. The airline is aiming to make their onboard product even more rarefied and refined with a set of improvements currently being rolled out.</p>
      <p>Upon stepping onboard, passengers will be greeted with a newly defined service moment in the form of a welcome tray with a personalized note, a hot towel and a glass of sparkling jasmine silver needle tea from the airline’s partner, JING.</p>

      <p>Passengers will also now find new wellness-focused menus with new recipes and lighter options for both the main and breakfast meals. These might include superfood bowls, side dishes with lean proteins, JING teas. Cold-pressed juices from Bless with ingredients meant to stoke the metabolism will be served before breakfast to refresh passengers and promote wakefulness.</p>
      <p>The serviceware is also getting an update and will include china from famed Japanese porcelain house Noritake, Robert Welch custom-designed cutlery, and full-size wine glasses from Riedel.</p>
      <p>First-class guests might also get a better night’s sleep thanks to the new amenities and bedding from U.K. luxury brand Bamford including 600 thread-count sheets, a duvet and mattress pad from sustainably sourced cotton, and a full-sized soft pillow. Flight attendants will also spray a dash of Bamford Botanic Pillow Mist as part of the airline’s new turndown service.</p>

      <p>New amenity kits will also feature skincare products by Bamford, and will come in both male and female selections.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Back to business</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the business-class cabin, meanwhile, long-haul passengers will also find a new range of bedding by Bamford including a soft mattress topper, larger pillows and premium slippers. The pillowcase and two-piece duvet will both be made from sustainably sourced cotton and 400 thread count. New unisex Bamford amenity kits will also begin appearing onboard from December 1 onwards and will be presented in a rotating selection of four colors.</p>

      <p>These changes are meant to complement the restaurant-style meal service Cathay Pacific introduced on various international routes last year as well as other hard-product improvements like the installation of high-speed Wi-Fi on the airline’s Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s.</p>
      <p>Among the improvements passengers in economy can expect are expanded entertainment options and new menus by Hong Kong restaurant group Black Sheep Restaurants in economy as well as the relaunch of the airline’s custom Betsy Beer.</p>
      <p>While more like refinements than revamps, these changes are welcome improvements that should make the already phenomenal onboard experience with Cathay Pacific that much more enjoyable.</p>
