      <h1>Sudanese officials: 6 troops killed in Yemeni rebel attack</h1>

      <p>CAIRO (AP) - Officials in Sudan said on Saturday an attack by Yemeni rebels killed six members of a Sudanese paramilitary force that’s been fighting in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a>.</p>
      <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led coalition that includes the Sudanese forces have fought <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a>’s civil war to a stalemate. The United Arab Emirates and Sudan have been pulling out troops in recent months, though they say they aren’t quitting the Saudi-led alliance.</p>
      <p>The officials said that the attack earlier this week targeted a position on the Saudi-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a> border held by Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or the RSF.</p>

      <p>Gen. Mohammed Hamadan Dagalo leads the RSF, which grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias used by former autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>In past years Dagalo, who is a Saudi ally, mobilized thousands of RSF troops to fight in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a> on behalf of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the backbone of the military coalition.</p>

      <p>The coalition was formed in 2015 to stem the advance of the Houthi rebels following their 2014 takeover of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a>’s capital, Sanaa and the northern provinces, pushing out the internationally recognized government.</p>
      <p>The Sudanese troops had deployed mainly to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a>’s border areas with Saudi Arabia to repel any attacks by Houthis on the kingdom.</p>
      <p>The officials said the Sudanese troops were patrolling the frontier area on Wednesday when they were attacked by the Houthis. At least three others were wounded in the attack.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.</p>

        <p>On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates had said an attack on the Saudi-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a> border killed one of its soldiers. But it’s unclear if the Sudanese troops were killed in the same attack which took place in Saudi Arabia’s Najran region.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not answer calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The war in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/yemen/">Yemen</a> has claimed over 100,000 of lives, thrust millions to the brink of famine and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia and the Houthis are holding indirect, behind-the-scenes talks to end the devastating five-year war.</p>
