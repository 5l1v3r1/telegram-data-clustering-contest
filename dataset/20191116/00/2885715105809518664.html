      <h1>Gujarat: Junagadh to get new court complex at Azad Chowk</h1>
      <h2>The decision comes after repeated representations from the Junagadh Bar Association, other organisations and local leaders.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:33:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>ACCEDING TO demands from lawyers and local leaders, the state government on Friday announced that a new court complex will be constructed in Junagadh in place of the old Civil Hospital at Azad Chowk.</p>
      <p>“Chief Minister Vijay Rupani today (Friday) decided to build a new iconic high-rise eco-friendly court building at Junagadh, in deference to the years’ old demand of the local lawyers and people. The new court building, occupying 38,000 sqm, will have solar panels, landscaping and adequate parking space. It will have district and other courts under one roof, at the plot where the old Civil Hospital is located,” an official release from the state information department said.</p>
      <p>The decision comes after repeated representations from the Junagadh Bar Association, other organisations and local leaders.</p>
      <p>“The existing court building is short of space and does not meet the Supreme Court norms which require around 55,000 square metre of space for a court establishment at district level. For paucity of space, only civil court, district and family court are functioning out the existing building near the district jail. Labour court sits in a multi-storey building and consumer court functions out of a building in Hathikhana Chowk. The vehicle parking lot is proving to be too small and the building itself is quite old, having been built in 1949. Therefore, as soon as the Civil Hospital shifted to a new building, we started making representation that a new court building be built in its place. We are thankful to the CM that he has accepted our demand,” PD Gadhvi, former president of Junagadh Bar Association, told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>. It was during Gadhvi’s tenure as the Bar president that the demand for a new court building had gathered momentum in early 2017.</p>
      <p>Junagadh medical college became operational five years ago. The Civil Hospital was attached to the new medical college. After the state government constructed a new building for the medial college, the hospital also gradually shifted to the new building while vacating the existing building in Azad Chowk.</p>
      <p>The transition was completed when Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a> formally inaugurated the new building in August last year.</p>
      <p>Pradip Khimani, a local <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> leader in Junagadh, said they had been demanding a new court building for about five years. “Litigants and lawyers are facing hardships as the existing court building is very congested. On the other hand, a huge space laid unused after civil hospital shifted to its new building near Majevadi Gate. We requested the government to make use of the space before encroachment becomes a nuisance and the government has responded positively,” he said.</p>
