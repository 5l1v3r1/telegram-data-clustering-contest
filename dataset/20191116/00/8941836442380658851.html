      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cornelius-aaron-pettus/">Pettus</a> and another officer gave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-allen/">Allen</a> a bicycle citation Sept. 30 before the suspected attack, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Some department officers were believed to be familiar with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-allen/">Allen</a> because of his YouTube account detailing interactions he had with police and uploaded cellphone footage of the encounters, Anchorage Police Chief Justin Doll said after the charges were announced.</p>

      <p>Doll was unsure if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cornelius-aaron-pettus/">Pettus</a> or the other officer knew <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-allen/">Allen</a> before giving him the citation, he said.</p>
      <p>“Officer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cornelius-aaron-pettus/">Pettus</a> disputes the charges and intends to exercise his rights to confront the State’s evidence,” defense attorney Clinton Campion said. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cornelius-aaron-pettus/">Pettus</a> responded in self-defense “based on what (he) perceived and knew at the moment of the incident,” she said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-allen/">Allen</a> told reporters Friday after arraignment that he is still healing from his injuries.</p>
      <p>“I forgive the dude. In my heart, I’m trying to. I’m in the process of doing that so I can move forward,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sam-allen/">Allen</a> said.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cornelius-aaron-pettus/">Pettus</a> remains on paid administrative leave pending the results of the police department’s own internal investigation, police spokesman MJ Thim said in an email.</p>
