      <p>The wealthy are being encouraged to be more generous with their money as research released on Saturday shows that nearly half (47%) of multimillionaires outside the U.S. donate less than 1% of their annual income to charitable causes.The Barriers To Giving report from Barclays Private Bank says that if every one of these multimillionaires were to increase their donations to 1% there would be "an additional £800 million ($1 billion) in annual global funding for charitable organisations".</p>

      <p>Worryingly, this trend in the wealthy not giving is growing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2019/07/11/just-10-of-multimillionaires-in-the-u-k-give-to-charity/#73017dea6c3b">In July it was revealed </a>that only 10% to 12% of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs)—those with a net worth over £10 million ($12.3 million)—are engaged in philanthropy.</p>
      <p>The Beacon Collaborative, which compiled the research, said £2 billion ($2.5 billion) could be raised if just 10% more UHNWIs engaged in giving.</p>
      <p>Barclays's study, in which the research agency Savanta polled 400 high net worth individuals in key markets outside the U.S., identified several "barriers to giving" explaining why less and less wealthy are giving to charity.</p>
      <p>The biggest of these is "other financial obligations", cited by 28% of respondents. Although each of those surveyed held assets of £5 million ($6.4 million) or more, they seemed find plenty of other things to spend their money on.</p>
      <p>"Providing for and educating their children, buying and improving their homes, going on holidays with their families, investing in their businesses or simply preserving their wealth for later in life (to safeguard against illness and old age), can use up a remarkable amount of income and resources", says the report.</p>
      <p>The other two largest barriers to giving, each cited by 25% of respondents, are control ("don't have control over how money is used") and trust ("don't have faith in the way charities are run").</p>

      <h3>Giving Makes You Feel Better</h3>
      <p>The benefits of charitable giving on their causes do not need to be argued. But a growing body of research suggests that donating to charity can actually help the donor as much as the recipient.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth W. Dunn, Lara B. Aknin and Michael I. Norton, of the University of British Columbia and Harvard Business School created a study where participants were randomly assigned to spend money on others and on themselves. Those spending money on others, the study found, experienced greater happiness.</p>
      <p>The Barclays report also recognises research from MIT that found there were neurological benefits in the empathetic thinking employed when donating to charity.</p>
      <p>"They have shown how the benefits on the donor of giving go beyond the simple ‘feel-good factor’ to actually improve their decision making, health and wellbeing", the Barriers To Giving report says of MIT's research.</p>
      <p>This research is still in its infancy, but it taps into the important and potentially lucrative field of wellbeing. The wellness industry is worth around $4.2 trillion according to the Global Wellness Institute, and most of that bill is being picked up by affluent or wealthy individuals, in the form of holistic holidays, nutritional diets and other perks. (After all, it is not the poor that pay to feel 'well')</p>
      <p>Should more wealthy attach giving to the same bundle of money they reserve for these oddments, then the charity sector would be alive and thriving. The rich might also feel better about themselves in the process.</p>
