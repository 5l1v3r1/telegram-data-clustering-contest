      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- During this year, this bank continues to participate in the main working directions of the entity: the expansion of e-payment channels, e-commerce, subsidies for housing construction and financial services to companies and agricultural producers of the territory; while maintaining all the efficiency indicators in positive figures, said Xiomara Leyva Pérez, its director.</p>
      <p>Entities such as Acinox Stainless Steel and the Metal Structures Factory, as well as sugarcane growers,  are among the most common clients of the bank. Something that distinguishes them among their peers in other regions of the Archipelago is the stability in their workgroup and the efficiency in services, the directive added.</p>
