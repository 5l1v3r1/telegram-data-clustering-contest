        <b>Pedja Mijatovic words about Gareth Bale's preferences has caused a stir in the world of football. So much so that they pulled out a flag that said "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order."</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was the account 'WelshFootyFlags' who published a flag echoing <b>Pedja Mijatovic's words.</b> The former footballer <b>criticised the Real Madrid player</b> for his attitude.</p>
      <p>There are few occasions when someone from outside Real Madrid has <b>criticised </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Bale</a><b>'s attitude towards the team</b>, compared to when he plays for Wales.</p>
      <p>In this way, the flag, requested by a Twitter user and made by MrFlag, according to 'AS', <b>recalls Mijatovic's words</b> about the Wales star.</p>
