      <h1>Taking a Long Flight? Eat These Foods to Arrive Feeling Healthy and Refreshed</h1>

      <p>Long-haul air travel is the gateway to seeing the world, but that doesn't mean it's always easy on the body. The pitfalls of long flights can include jet lag, bloating, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Do-Compression-Socks-Really-Help-When-Flying-46401981">swelling of the legs and feet</a>, dehydration, and dry skin. But fear not, international traveler, because the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Worst-Food-Eat-Plane-37116646">foods you eat in the air</a> can actually make a huge difference in the way you feel, both in flight and after the plane touches down. By <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Healthy-Tips-Flying-43864198">choosing your snacks carefully</a>, you can severely diminish the negative effects of flying — <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Why-Do-We-Get-Jet-Lag-44315225">even jet lag!</a> We asked experts to share their top picks for traveling several hours in the sky, and now we're ready to tackle any flight across the ocean.</p>
      <h3>Water</h3>

      <p>Sure, it might not technically be food, but water is perhaps the most important item on this list. Flying can severely dehydrate you due to low humidity levels in the cabin, so it's vital to increase your water intake. "Drinking lots of water prevents bloating, headache, and fatigue," <a href="http://www.mediaambassadors.com/mimi-secor">Mimi Secor</a>, DNP, cofounder of the health and fitness program <a href="http://www.coachkatanddrmimi.com/">Coach Kat and Dr. Mimi</a>, told POPSUGAR. "Also, avoid caffeine and alcohol because both can cause headaches, fatigue, irritability, and contribute to jet lag and poor sleep. If I'm craving alcohol or a soda, I order club soda with lemon or lime."</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.drharrymd.com/">Eudene Harry</a>, MD, medical director of <a href="http://www.md.com/doctor/eudene-harry-md#office-193719">Oasis Wellness and Rejuvenation Center</a>, recommends coconut water for best results. "Coconut water provides double the benefits: hydration and high potassium," she explained. "Both hydration and potassium help keep muscles from cramping and your energy level up."</p>
      <p>So, how much should you drink? The Aerospace Medical Association recommends <a href="http://www.asma.org/asma/media/asma/Travel-Publications/HEALTH-TIPS-FOR-AIRLINE-TRAVEL-Trifold-2013.pdf">eight ounces of water for every hour you're in the air</a>. Grab a refillable water once you've cleared security, and ask your flight attendant to keep the water coming.</p>
      <h3>Fresh Fruits</h3>

      <p>Fresh fruits like cantaloupes, watermelons, strawberries, grapes, and blueberries are typically easy to travel with and are rockstar flight snacks for a variety of reasons. "There might be several benefits here," Dr. Harry told POPSUGAR. "<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Best-Foods-Hydration-44799698">Foods with high water content</a> and fiber can help prevent bloating and provide hydration. Plus, the antioxidant and vitamin C value of these foods can help keep your immunity up."</p>
      <h3>Unsalted Nuts or Homemade Trail Mix</h3>

      <p>Almonds, pecans, hazelnuts, and boast a number of benefits. For one thing, they're filling and can provide long-lasting energy so you're not totally wiped out once you land, Dr. Harry explained. "Nuts also provide essential fats, proteins, and minerals such as magnesium," she continued. "This is important because long flights can leave the muscles with a tendency to cramp and become painful. Magnesium can help to counteract this tendency." Just avoid varieties with added salt. <a href="http://familydoctor.org/condition/edema/">Foods high in sodium can cause your body to hold onto excess water</a>, causing your legs and feet to swell.</p>
      <p>If you're tired of plain nuts, try making your own trail mix. "If you have a sweet tooth, dried fruits like cranberries are a great addition since they are low-sugar and high in antioxidants, Vitamin C, and fiber," Abbie Gellman, RD, founder of <a href="http://www.culinarynutritioncuisine.com/">Culinary Nutrition Cuisine</a>, told POPSUGAR. Try combining them with walnuts, almonds, popcorn, and sunflower seeds.</p>
      <h3>Hummus and Vegetables</h3>

      <p>"Hummus provides protein that keeps you feeling full and satisfied while providing you with the energy to get through your trip," Dr. Harry said, noting that pairing it with water-rich, anti-inflammatory vegetables may help ease some of the inevitable aches and pains you experience during a long flight.</p>
      <p>Plus, veggies that are high in water and fiber, such as carrots and celery sticks, can keep you hydrated and regulate your digestive system, leading to fewer bathroom breaks in the air. "The fiber adsorbs the water, which then allows less free water to pass as urine," Tarek Hassanein, MD, FACP, founder of the <a href="http://www.livercenters.com/">Southern California GI and Liver Centers</a>, told POPSUGAR. That's in addition to keeping your body well-hydrated and in top form. "It's a two-for-one – your body is operating better, and getting rid of less," he said.</p>
      <h3>Lean Protein</h3>

      <p>While it's not exactly feasible to keep a full roasted chicken in your backpack, there are a variety of easy-to-transport options that are brimming with lean protein. "Protein is definitely the nutrient to reach for because it helps with satiety and comes in a variety of forms, like bars (look for ones low in sugar), trail mix, or nut butters that are suitable for travel," Gellman said. "By helping you feel fuller for longer, you are less likely to reach for sugary foods that can cause headaches and stomach pain if consumed in excess."</p>
