      <p>Some days it just isn’t easy being a billionaire — or a billionaire’s offspring. At a conference on happiness that was held at the Vatican earlier this month, one billionaire’s daughter felt compelled to take the stage to defend her lot in life. Jennifer Gross, whose father is bond investor Bill Gross, gave a spontaneous speech defending the role of the wealthy in society in response to what she perceived as comments bashing the rich. “I would caution against vilifying an entire demographic and treating them as if they don’t have the right to become fully human,” Gross told a crowd of scholars and dignitaries at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences’ conference entitled “Science and Ethics for Happiness and Well-Being.” A charitable foundation she runs helped fund the November. 5 event, with a six-figure donation.</p>
      <p>Gross, who is 44, says she originally planned to focus her time slot on the importance of goal-setting and gratitude.  But she changed course after negative “comments kept coming about the 1% and the wealthy.”  </p>
      <p>Gross explains that she felt anti-billionaire sentiment at the conference. “There was one speaker that said if she were part of the 1% that she wouldn’t be at this meeting. It was a joke. Nevertheless, it hurt my feelings,” says Gross, who founded and runs the Blue Chip Foundation - which made $377,000 in grants in 2017 - and is a director at the William, Jeff and Jennifer Gross Foundation. (Gross said she did not recall the identity of the speaker.)  </p>
      <p>Gross also pointed to statements by Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and an Catholic bishop, made in the context of interpreting the Christian beatitudes — the blessings listed by Jesus in his Sermon on the Mount, as recounted in the Bible. One well-known verse, from the book of Luke, begins: ‘Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.” According to a transcript Gross provided, Sorondo said: “Christ rejects the opinion of those who say that happiness consists in an abundance of external goods; thus Christ says, Happy are the poor in spirit.” Gross, who was raised a Catholic, interpreted the bishop as saying the wealthy are not happy. (Sorondo could not be reached for comment.)</p>
      <p>Many of the other conference attendees didn’t see it that way. Eight people who attended the event could not recall any attacks on the rich, and said the role of billionaires in society was not a prominent conversation, save for Gross’s speech. </p>
      <p>“I was an organizer and I attended every session, each of which was followed by lively discussion,” Owen Flanagan, a Duke philosophy professor, told <i>Forbes</i> in an email. “Perhaps something was said during the fast-paced 20-30 minute q-and-a’s after each panel. I don’t know. I do not recall *any* criticism of the 1% as such, or any discussion of the wealth tax issue.”</p>
      <p>Three additional professors who attended the conference — Barabara Fredrickson from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Mary Hirschfeld from Villanova University and Sonja Lyubomirsky from University of California, Riverside — also said they did not recall any comments made about the 1%. </p>
      <p>Jeffrey Sachs, a noted Columbia University economist who helped organize the conference, says inequality was a topic of conversation, though he did not say attendees critiqued the rich. “We discussed in depth the crisis of poverty in the midst of wealth, and the virtues of pursuing the common good, including help for the poorest of the poor to meet their needs,” he told <i>Forbes</i> in an email. </p>
      <p>Not that the uber-rich haven’t been taking more heat lately, particularly as 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders stump around the their wealth tax proposals. Warren, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN0a_ZhYjac&amp;amp=&amp;amp=&amp;amp=&amp;feature=youtu.be">unveiled </a> a new ad on Thursday attacking billionaires, has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/14/leon-cooperman-responds-to-elizabeth-warrens-anti-billionaires-tv-ad-shes-disgraceful/#618d9354f62c">drawn</a> public criticism from several members of the <i>Forbes </i>billionaires list, including Bill Gates, Mark Cuban and Leon Cooperman. </p>
      <p>Gross said she felt compelled to use her scheduled speaking time to make the environment less hostile. “I wanted to make sure that in discussions moving forward that we were all in a level place …. and there wouldn’t be any bashing of billionaires,” she says. “Otherwise, I felt like I couldn’t go forward in honest communication with the people in that room. That night, instead of being angry and alone by myself, I thought I would change the dialogue.”</p>
      <p>In her speech, Gross argued that those who criticize the rich forget all the good that philanthropically-minded billionaires like her father do for society. Bill Gross, whose net worth <i>Forbes</i> pegs at $1.5 billion, has donated  more than $700 million to charity, and told <i>Forbes </i>that he plans to donate most of his fortune to his foundation when he dies. His daughter emphasized that, virtuous or not, the wealthy are people, too. “I do think we need to treat everyone as human beings,” Gross said at the Vatican. “It has become very popular to bash billionaires. There is no solidarity in that. It creates separation between us and ultimately unhappiness.” </p>
      <p>One attendee said she was surprised upon hearing Gross’s speech. “My initial reaction was curiosity. How was I in this room and I missed what was perceived as a vilification of billionaires?” she said. ‘Second, I kind of thought, ‘Did I miss this?’ Because whatever was said didn’t strike me as vilification. Maybe it struck me as true or correct.”  </p>
      <p>Unlike some of the super-rich, Gross supports progressive policies. In her talk at the conference, Gross said that the U.S. government prioritizes spending on the military over social services, and billionaires play an important role in filling this void.  </p>
      <p>Her father Bill, who cofounded investment management firm PIMCO and was nicknamed the “Bond King” for his role in popularizing fixed-income investments, says that while he is a fan of Elizabeth Warren and is generally supportive of policies to redistribute the fortunes of the rich to mitigate inequality, he is proud of his daughter for standing up for him.</p>
      <p>“Jennifer is of a liberal, democratic persuasion, so defending billionaires is not typical,” Bill Gross tells <i>Forbes</i>. “She did it to support me, to let those who [heard her speech] know that there are billionaires that give back and give back large sums.”</p>
      <p>The attendee who was surprised by the speech says she understands Gross’s desire to defend her father, but that conversations about the morality of wealth shouldn’t necessarily be taken personally. “We can say it is immoral for extreme wealth inequality to exist in the world without saying you personally are a bad human being,” the attendee explains. “Those are two different things. It’s not always clear that people with that kind of money can disentangle the two.”</p>
