      <p><b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/joonchoii/">hyukjoon choi</a> has built the trestle bench using just a few elements. </b>firstly, the ladder-shape legs provide the main structural part while making visual reference to the connecting rafters that are used to construct korean hanok houses. secondly, a long piece of timber connects the legs together. finally, two circular discs are fixed to the bench, resulting in an ideal two-person seat.</p>
