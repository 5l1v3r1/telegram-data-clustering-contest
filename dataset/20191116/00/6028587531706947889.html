      <h1>Inside The Resurrection Of Zagat, The Restaurant Bible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Kirsch</a></address>
      <p>I<b>cons of culinary history are served up at Manhattan’s Le Coucou bistro: </b>steaks au poivre, foie gras, and <i>oeuf</i>s suspended in <i>gelée. </i>It’s an ideal place for Chris Stang, a lightly stubbled media executive, to discuss the resurrection of another dining icon, the Zagat Guide. Stang’s restaurant review business, The Infatuation, is bringing back the maroon food directory that built a cult following around its crowd-sourced restaurant ratings.</p>
      <p>“This certainly wasn’t something that was on the roadmap,” says Stang, 40, cofounder and CEO of the 10-year-old startup, which bought the rights to the once-ubiquitous guide from Google last year. “That’s what makes it fun. We just felt strongly that we wanted to give people what they expected.” </p>
      <p>For decades, <a href="https://zagat.com/">Zagat</a> guides (Stang pronounces it zuh-GAT, by the way) were nothing short of Holy Scripture for diners. Founded in 1979 by Tim and Nina Zagat, the books synthesized thousands of customer reviews into ratings of restaurants’ food, decor, service and cost. New York was the first edition, followed by a panoply of offshoots: Los Angeles Nightlife, Houston Restaurants, America’s Top Golf Courses. All of them vanished in 2016, five years after the tech giant bought the company from its founders.</p>
      <p>Seated next to his editor-in-chief, Hillary Reinsberg, Stang takes a breath to tuck into a celery root and crab salad served under a veil of Honeycrisp apples, before musing on the importance of the new venture. </p>
      <p>“Tim Zagat would tell you the anecdote that there were years when they outsold the Bible and the dictionary,” Stang says.</p>
      <p>Is that true?</p>
      <p>“I don’t know,” he laughs, adding that he has smaller ambitions to start. For now Stang is publishing only the New York version of the guide. “I think what we need to do is be smart and strategic about what we do next.”</p>

      <p>The new book features 1,400 restaurants scored from more than 200,000 ratings—Locanda Verde has “sexy” vibes, reviewers say; Little Pepper’s Sichuan fare is “legit spicy”—“The opinions that you see here are all a reflection of the diners,” adds Reinsberg.</p>
      <p>Those diners are average restaurant-goers—unlike the <a href="https://guide.michelin.com/us/en">Michelin</a> Guide’s highly trained and anonymous inspectors—though perhaps with more refined palates than the typical Yelp reviewer. </p>
      <p>Over a serving of <i>poulet</i>, a roast breast and stuffed wing with vinegar and mustard, Stang walks back in time. He grew up in Denver and attended Colorado State, where he worked for the college’s radio station, KCSU FM. During his junior year, he traveled to New York for a radio convention, where he was invited to attend a live taping of MTV’s <i>Total Request Live</i>.</p>
      <p>“This is in the year 2000, when TRL is at its absolute peak of relevance. Chubby Carson Daly TRL,” he recalls. </p>
      <p>Another free ticket went to Andrew Steinthal, who worked at Ithaca College’s station. He and Stang were seated next to each other, directly behind Daly, until a producer yanked them from their spots because, as he puts it, “we weren’t screaming loud enough.” </p>
      <p>The pair formed a quick bond. “For whatever reason, the first thing we started saying to each other was ‘We want to do something together.’ There was some sort of innate desire to be entrepreneurial,” Stang says.</p>

      <p>That instinct lay dormant for the next decade, as Steinthal rose to become a VP at Warner Brothers Records and Stang climbed the ranks at Atlantic Records, both part of the Warner Music Group corporate family. In 2009, the pair struck up a hobby writing restaurant reviews, which they distributed to friends and eventually housed on a website called Immaculate Infatuation. </p>
      <p>Soon after, while eating at The Redhead in the East Village, a nearby diner overheard them talking about the site. “She said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard about the Immaculate Infatuation,’” Stang says. “My first response was ‘How do you know my mom?’”</p>
      <p>The woman turned out to be a journalist who was writing a story on changing tastes in dining. A few months later, Immaculate Infatuation appeared in a story on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i> dining section. “That essentially referenced us as credible experts in the dining scene. And that was massive,” Stang says.</p>
      <p>The company began generating additional revenue hosting events, then rebranded as The Infatuation in 2014. That year, Stand and Steinthal left their record label jobs to run the business full-time, with Steinthal now serving as chief revenue officer.</p>
      <p>Reinsberg joined as The Infatuation’s first editorial employee later in 2014. She had met the founders while working at BuzzFeed, when she emailed them a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hillaryreinsberg/new-york-city-foods-that-deserve-more-hype">listicle</a> she wrote about underhyped foods in New York, like chickpea fries and wontons in chili oil. (It was a side project “while I was editing some pretty serious long-form features,” says Reinsberg, a 2019 <i>Forbes </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2019/media/#43114b86a59b">30 Under 30</a> list member.) </p>
      <p>Reinsberg helped The Infatuation expand to more cities—San Francisco, Austin, Chicago—but Stang felt the slow pace of growth would never allow the site to compete with the likes of Yelp. “If we were going to scale and be a global brand that had an offering for hundreds of millions of people around the world, then we were going to have to figure out a user-generated element.” </p>
      <p>Cue Zagat. Google had acquired the company from its founders for $151 million in 2011, but it had a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-zagat-story-2013-6#ixzz3YkUB8WBn">rocky experience</a> inside the tech giant. Google’s top brass reportedly deprioritized the acquisition and began laying off its staff. </p>

      <p>Out of the blue, Stang received an email from Google’s corporate development team in 2017 asking if he wanted to buy the brand, with no employees attached. “That week we started engaging around what it might all look like,” Stang says.</p>
      <p>The day before Thanksgiving, they landed the deal. The transaction closed in March 2018; terms were not disclosed, but it’s fair to assume The Infatuation—which had raised just $3.5 million in funding at the time—paid a small fraction of the 2011 price. </p>
      <p>The new Zagat book, then, is phase one of a plan to get users directly involved in The Infatuation brand. With 60,000 copies in print, Stang will soon know if the guides can recapture their place in the zeitgeist. In the digital age, it’s a crowded field, with OpenTable, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Zomato and more. </p>
      <p>Much relies on consumer trust. Reviews are an inherently subjective form. Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn, for instance, which the <i>Times </i>recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/dining/peter-luger-review-pete-wells.html">scorched</a> with a zero star review, is the third most popular restaurant in The Infatuation’s Zagat (and holds a strong 8.4 score on the site itself). There may be places where even Zagat and The Infatuation don’t align, Reinsberg admits, “and I think that’s okay.” </p>
      <p>Diversification will remain key as Stang works to grow the overall business and take on Yelp and its peers. Armed with $30 million he raised last fall from Jeffrey Katzenberg’s investment firm, WndrCo, he’s got a strong start on the challenge.</p>
      <p>“We want to build something big and ubiquitous,” Stang says, as a carafe of French press lands at the table. “We want The Infatuation to become the default.”  </p>
