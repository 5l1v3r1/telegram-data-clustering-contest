      <h1>How to see a meteor shower over the UK this weekend</h1>
      <h2>The Leonids will peak on Saturday night and Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:01:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>A high-speed meteor shower will light up the skies over the UK this weekend as the Leonids reach their peak with up to 15 shooting stars every hour.</p>
      <p>The Leonids are renowned for being bright and clear, in part thanks to the 44 miles per second speed of the debris as it smashes into the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
      <p>A nearly full moon and the recent bad weather may make seeing the shower harder than in previous years, but anyone who can find a clear sky in a dark location should be in for a treat.</p>
      <p>The shower will get busier through the evening on Saturday, peaking after midnight.</p>
      <p>According to NASA you should look West to get the best view, with the far north of the country and the South East set to get the best views on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>Half of the shower is expected to leave visible trails that will remain in the sky for several seconds, thanks to the composition of rocks from the Comet Tempel-Tuttle.</p>
      <p>The Leonid shower appears to come from in the constellation Leo.</p>
      <p>The best view is forecast to be in 2034 when 2,000 meteors an hour will crash across the sky.</p>
      <p>If you miss the Leonids, the Geminids will be along in around a month with 120 meteors an hour.</p>
