      <h1>Fantasy Football Week 11 Wide Receiver Sleepers, 2 Star WRs To Avoid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Zach Petersel</a></address>
      <p>New week, same drill.On Wednesday I spoke about some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachpetersel/2019/11/13/fantasy-football-sleeper-running-backs-to-start-in-week-11/">running back sleepers to target</a> and like with the RBs, there are some heavy-hitters on bye.</p>
      <p>However, also like with the RBs, I think there are some nice value for us to capitalize on with <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/half-point-ppr-wr.php">FantasyPros’ half-PPR rankings</a> this week, in addition to a few wide receivers I think are ranked too high. If your league has unique rules or you’re just looking for more help, their <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/myplaybook/football-start-sit-assistant.php?partner=petersel">Start/Sit Assistant</a> is right there as well!</p>
      <p>With that let’s get you some Week 11 fantasy football sleeper wide receivers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Jacksonville Jaguars WR Dede Westbrook (FantasyPros Rank, 38)</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve been with me since the beginning of the year (thank you,) you know <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachpetersel/2019/08/15/fantasy-football-wr-sleepers-to-target-in-the-middle-of-your-draft/#54b9a644424f">how much I’ve loved Dede Westbrook</a>.</p>
      <p>He was coming off a 101-target season. His new offensive coordinator John DeFilippo touted him as the <a href="https://twitter.com/FieldYates/status/1165014878651858951">best route runner he’s ever been around</a>. He showed out in his lone preseason game with then-new quarterback Nick Foles, being targeted on seven of Foles’ 10 passes, catching all seven.</p>
      <p>Then, Nick Foles got hurt in Week 1, and all my hopes were tossed aside...until now.</p>
      <p>Westbrook has run 79 percent of his routes from the slot this season, the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball/story/0ap3000001076712/article/slot-report-week-11-mike-evans-chris-godwin-get-boosts">sixth-highest percentage</a> in the NFL. Care to guess where Foles likes to throw the ball? In 2018, he threw to the slot 36.4 percent of the time, the second-highest number in the NFL, also courtesy of <a href="http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball/story/0ap3000001076712/article/slot-report-week-11-mike-evans-chris-godwin-get-boosts">Michael Florio of NFL.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Westbrook finished as a WR3 last season in half-PPR formats, and his quarterback improves from Blake Bortles to a former Super Bowl MVP. DJ Chark (WR1-production this season) and Chris Conley (three straight weeks of seven targets) have developed to the point where Westbrook’s target share isn’t what I would have projected in Week 1. He’s also coming off a shoulder injury, but practiced fully this week and is expected to return.</p>

        <b>2. Dallas Cowboys WR Randall Cobb (FantasyPros Rank, 50)</b>
      </p>
      <p>16 targets over the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>Dak Prescott, <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/player-stat/gross-yards-per-passing-attempt">No. 2 in the NFL in yards per attempt</a>, No. 2 in <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/player-stat/net-yards-per-passing-play">net passing yards per play</a> throwing him the rock.</p>
      <p>Facing a Lions defense that has been awful against the pass. Courtesy of <a href="https://www.rotoworld.com/article/start-em-or-sit-em/week-11-start-em-or-sit-em-3?sf223786526=1">RotoWorld’s Nick Mensio</a>, Detroit is</p>
      <ol>
        <li>31st in opponent plays per game.</li>
        <li>28th in passing yards allowed.</li>
        <li>27th in passing touchdowns given up.</li>
        <li>26th in fantasy points given up to quarterbacks.</li>
        <li>23rd in pass-defense DVOA.</li>
        <li>23rd in opponent passer rating.</li>
        <li>22nd in opponent yards per attempt.</li>
        <li>Face the seventh-most pass attempts per game.</li>
        <li>25th in adjusted sack rate with the Cowboys coming in at No. 2 in pass blocking.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Safe to say, they haven’t been good. They’ve been so (not) good, Mitchell Trubisky and Daniel Jones have seven combined touchdowns against them in two of their last three games. Their slot corner Justin Coleman has been terrible over the last five games, allowing 29-of-38 passing for 395 yards and three touchdowns, which is where Cobb will live on Sunday.</p>
      <p>All the while, Dallas has been nothing short of outstanding this season and over the last two weeks Cobb has played a huge role in the offense, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1191752987695370241">including a nullified touchdown</a> in Week 9.</p>
      <p>With a <a href="https://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/odds/las-vegas/?s=724">projected over/under of 47 points</a>, both teams in the top-10 in the league in terms of <a href="https://twitter.com/NickMensio/status/1194632293526097922">plays per game</a>, and the Cowboys seven-point favorites, Cobb has a relatively high-floor with a nice WR3 upside considering where he falls in the rankings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WRs to Avoid: Stefon Diggs (Rank, 15) and Allen Robinson (Rank, 20)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Avoid Chris Harris.</p>
      <p>This is something I’ve been preaching all season (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachpetersel/2019/10/25/fantasy-football-sleeper-wide-receivers-to-play-in-week-8-the-star-wr-to-avoid/#37f1c6cc747c">Week 8</a> and again <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachpetersel/2019/11/01/fantasy-football-sleeper-wide-receivers-to-play-in-week-9-the-star-wrs-to-avoid/#72c1d0c16317">Week 9</a>,) and I’m diving right back on in because the water is still warm. Diggs recently had a three game stretch of 21 catches for 453 yards and three touchdowns, but over his last two games he has just four catches for 54 yards total.</p>
      <p>It just so happens, in each of those games Adam Thielen has been out or barely played. With Thielen out, Kyle Rudolph’s role has expanded in the offense while Minnesota has continued to look to run the ball more and more. Listed as <a href="https://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/odds/las-vegas/?s=724">10-point favorites</a> with one of the lowest over/unders on the slate, signs aren’t pointing to a positive game-script for Diggs to succeed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Avoid Mitchell Trubisky.</p>
      <p>I understand he had three passing touchdowns on Sunday. That’s lovely. He’s also still Mitchell Trubisky.</p>
      <p>He ranks <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/player-stat/gross-yards-per-passing-attempt">dead last</a> in passing yards per attempt this season among qualified quarterbacks. He’s in the <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/player-stat/qb-rating-nfl">bottom-10</a> in QB rating. This week he’s facing a <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef/2019">top-five defense</a> in the league in the Rams and Allen Robinson faces one of, if not the best corner in football in Jalen Ramsey. Chicago has the <a href="https://twitter.com/NickMensio/status/1194278400120229888">third-lowest projected point total</a> among all teams on the Week 11 slate.</p>
      <p>Allen Robinson may be a top-five talent among wide receivers in the NFL, so I’d never suggest you outright sit him. Your backups need to present a similar upside with a higher floor. It’s just a situation if you do happen to have a nice bench, or a player like Terry McLaurin (ranked 23rd this week), or Calvin Ridley (ranked 28th) or even Deebo Samuel (ranked 36th) if Sanders and Kittle don’t play, you should seriously consider letting Robinson sit this one out.</p>
