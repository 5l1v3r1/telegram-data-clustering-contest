      <p>Zamfara State governor, Bello Matawalle, has removed 21 permanent secretaries because they failed an aptitude test conducted by the state government to assess their competence.</p>
      <p>The governor announced this while addressing journalists at the Government House, Gusau, on Friday.</p>
      <p>Matawalle, who said the decision was aimed at making the service more compact and result-oriented, stated that he decided to reduce the number of permanent secretaries because the state had the highest number of them in the North-West.</p>
      <p>He said, “All assessments have shown our state has a far greater number of permanent secretaries than any of our sister states in the North-West, and we constituted a restructuring committee to verify their competence.</p>
      <p>“The committee, therefore, invited all the permanent secretaries and six others whose appointments were reversed by the past administration and subjected them to a written test and interview to assess them.</p>
      <p>“Based on the outcome of the assessment, only 26 qualified for retention as permanent secretaries.”</p>
      <p>He, however, maintained that those who failed the test and were demoted would be considered for reassignment to parastatals as directors-general, managing directors and executive secretaries.</p>
