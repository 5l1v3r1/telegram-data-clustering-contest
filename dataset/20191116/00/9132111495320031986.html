      <p>A former Ghanaian judge at the International Boxing Federation (IBF) has called on the New Crusading Guide Editor-in-Chief, Abdul Malik Kweku Baako Jr to refrain from commenting on public issues.</p>
      <p>Confidence Hiagbe says the veteran journalist is ‘unfit’ to discuss any public affairs since he used to smoke the banned substance marijuana for almost 26 years.</p>
      <p>“He can continue operating his New Crusading Guide but it will be hypocritical for him to go and sit [on radio and TV] and comment on social matters,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Mr Baako Jr in 2014 revealed on Joy News’ news analysis programme ‘NewsFile’ that he used to smoke marijuana while contributing to a discussion on calls for marijuana to be legalised in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The former judge of Ghana Boxing Association (GBA) said he was inspired by Mr Baako’s story to quit smoking wee and now wants to atone for his crime by resigning from his position as a boxing judge.</p>
      <p>He further tasked other individuals in high public offices of the country to also resign from their jobs because they are being dishonest to the nation and citizens.</p>
      <p>“It is criminal if you smoke marijuana and you are caught. It is also dishonourable if you smoke marijuana and you are not caught,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Hiagbe added, “move away from public light if you smoke or you have even quit smoking because you have a stain on yourself and unworthy of serving the country.”</p>
      <p>The former IBF judge believes if smokers should atone for their sins while on earth they will not have to pay for their sins in the hereafter.</p>
      <p>“If you were not caught, it is because you are a ‘smooth criminal’ it doesn’t change the fact that you are still a criminal.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hiagbe tended his resignation on November 14, 2019, to the President of IBF stating that he wishes to quit his job solely based on moral grounds.</p>
      <p>“I hereby purge my conscience by stepping down as IBF Boxing Judge with immediate effect. You are hereby advised not to schedule any international fights for me again,” his letter read.</p>
