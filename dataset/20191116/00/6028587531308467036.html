      <p>Here’s a brief guide on how to sign up to watch <i>The Mandalorian</i> on Disney+.</p>
      <h3>What Is The Mandalorian?</h3>
      <p>First, you’ll want to keep in mind that <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/xPdzx"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> is a Disney+ exclusive. That means that even if you have a Hulu, Netflix or any other streaming service subscription, the only way to actually watch the show will be on Disney+.</p>
      <p>Once that’s out of the way, consider the many places to find Disney+. You can stream it to your television with a Disney+ app or with help from a set-top box via Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV or Roku. You can also watch Disney+ content on your phone or computer.</p>
      <h3>Do You Need Disney+ To Watch?</h3>
      <p>Regardless of what you’ll use to watch the show, you can plan on signing up just once. From there, you can simply log in to your Disney+ account with your username and password and be all set.</p>
      <h3>How Much Does It Cost To Watch The Mandalorian?</h3>
      <p>Disney+ costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. You’ll have the option of choosing either plan when you sign up. If you have a Verizon Unlimited plan (or sign up for one), you can also get Disney+ for free for a year. The same goes for the company’s Fios Home service. Disney also offers a bundle discount if you sign up for Hulu, ESPN+, and Disney+ streaming in a package. But you’ll only save a few bucks.</p>
      <p>Once you’re ready to go, download the Disney+ app to your preferred device or head over to the Disney+ website to sign up. You’ll get a free seven-day trial, after which you’ll start paying either $6.99 per month or $69 per year for the service, depending on the option you pick.</p>
      <h3>Where Can You Watch The Mandalorian?</h3>
      <p>Once that process is complete, move over to the device on which you want to watch <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/xPdzx"><i>The Mandalorian</i> and either download the Disney+ app</a> or simply log in via the browser. Either way, you’ll want to be in your account to start streaming.</p>
      <p>Next up, find <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/xPdzx"><i>The Mandalorian </i></a>on Disney+. Chances are, you’ll see it in the original shows listing of the service, but if not, simply search for the show and it’ll come up. Choose the first episode, hit play and enjoy <i>The </i><a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/xPdzx"><i>Mandalorian</i></a> in all its glory.</p>
      <p>Once you’re done and waiting for new episodes, consider checking out other Disney+ content. You’ll find plenty to like and watch. And best of all, Disney has promised even more content as time goes on.</p>
