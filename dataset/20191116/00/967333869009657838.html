      <p>On 9 October, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring to free its southern border area from Daesh* fighters and Kurdish militants, which Ankara believes to be terrorists. After <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201910191077088944-turkish-operation-peace-spring-suspended-for-120-hours-whats-next/">a series of ceasefire arrangements</a> with the United States and Russia, the active phase of the operation came to an end.</p>
