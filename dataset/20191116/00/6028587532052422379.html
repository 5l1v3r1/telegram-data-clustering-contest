      <p>As we women choose to complete higher education and focus on our carrier first, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in">global fertility rates are dropping</a>. While the global <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2019/08/08/she-conomy-drives-circular-economy/#1701a561635a">trend for women having fewer babies later in life</a> is growing, the rise in income tends to increase the average spend per baby, too. Seeing a boom in the baby market, both, in the affordable and premium segments: Whether you look at baby fashion, baby food – or <a href="https://www.euromonitor.com/nappies-diapers-pants">babies’ nappies/diapers (USD 37.6 billion in 2018) or disposable pants (USD 8.2 billion in 2018)</a>. What’s more, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/664656/global-baby-diapers-market-value/">global baby diaper market value is increasing</a>. Obviously, babies are most valuable customers. And retailers should consider pampering babies, particularly, as they can capitalise from the growing sustainability trend in premium and natural fashion, food – and diapers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>From toxic to green poopy diapers</b>
      </p>
      <p>On a daily basis, around 10 million diapers are used and then thrown away in Germany, alone. Worldwide makes this: 250 million disposable diapers to be used every single day. Thrown away, ending up in landfills – where a <a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/p/are-diapers-biodegradable-compostable">single-use disposable diaper takes up to 500 years to biodegrade and decompose</a>. Obviously, the world needs circular solutions to conquer babies’ diaper waste. And politics are acting. <a href="https://dailypost.vu/news/disposable-diapers-and-more-to-be-banned/article_0be48a14-864c-5f32-960f-e1336b742046.html">Vanuatu</a>, a small Pacific Island nation announced a ban on single-use disposable diapers, as the first nation to take such a bold step forward. While the world recognises the environmental problems that single-use disposable diapers pose, the <a href="https://www.ecosurety.com/news/horizon-scanning-uk-extended-producer-responsibility-what-you-need-to-know/">European Union’ Extended Producer Responsibility</a> law puts the responsibility on the producer of a product – to make, take and contribute sustainable (product stewardship). With significant focus and consumer demand on sustainable solutions, seeing expansion of products positioned in the natural segment. The leader in disposable diapers: <a href="https://news.pg.com/press-release/pg-corporate-announcements/say-goodbye-compromise-say-hello-pampers-pure-protection-wo">Procter &amp; Gamble</a> introduced successfully the Pure Protection brand of baby nappies/diapers and wipes. While still small in actual sales, <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/money/local-business-news/still-looking-for-sales-growth-procter-gamble-co-hikes-prices">Pure Protection</a> rose quickly within the natural segment to trend among the top natural positioned brands in the US. However, most brands currently positioned in the natural segment – while emphasising on cotton usage which is criticised for its unsustainable reality in being non-environmentally friendly, need to innovate on ingredients, recycling technology and waste management. For securing future growth, brand competitiveness, consumer loyalty – and environmental progress.</p>

        <b>Taking little green steps with a biodegradable and eco-friendly diaper</b>
      </p>
      <p>Raising a green and eco-friendly baby utilising sustainable products is simple, when you know where to shop: For biodegradable diapers, free of perfumes, chlorine, plastic, and any genetically modified organisms – go for Nature Babycare (Naty). Or: <a href="https://bambonatureusa.com/">BAMBO Nature</a>, when looking at hypoallergenic diapers that are free of harmful chemicals such as chlorine, organotins, PVC, phthalates, latex, heavy metals, and formaldehyde. Also, to be considered: <a href="https://www.loveandgreen.fr/">Love &amp; Green</a>. <a href="https://www.lillydoo.com/de/">Lillydoo</a>. <a href="https://www.lespetitsculottes.com/fr/">Les Petits Culottés</a>. <a href="https://www.pampers.fr/couches-lingettes-harmonie/pampers-harmonie-couches">Pampers Harmonie</a>. <a href="https://bambonatureusa.com/">BAMBO Nature</a>. <a href="https://www.seventhgeneration.com/baby-care">Seventh Generation</a>, and <a href="https://www.earthsbest.com/products/category/diapers-wipes/diapers/">Earth’s Best</a>. <a href="https://www.honest.com/baby-products/honest-diapers/baby-diapers.html">The Honest Company</a>, as its diapers are non-toxic and hypoallergenic. <a href="https://babyganics.com/products/category/diapering/">Babyganics</a>, known to be the most affordable biodegradable diapers. 100 per cent biodegradable, however more expensive than the average diapers: <a href="https://www.babygearlab.com/reviews/diapering-potty/disposable-diaper/broody-chick">Broody Chick Eco-Natural</a>. And, when using bamboo: Andy Pandy. And more. Choices are given, as these organic brands are going for <i>pure</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>nature</i>, and <i>eco-friendly diapers</i> – on its packaging, evoking to be sustainable and good for the planet.</p>

        <b>Born to be a sustainable superstar</b>
      </p>
      <p>With my nephew’s arrival, I am strongly considering what’s best for him and the world he is about to conquer. Protecting this cute little boy has taken up first priority. Second, to improve his life by guiding retail and fashion ecosystems in its shared mission for a sustainable, circular economy.</p>
      <p>Join me for creating a better world for our babies! </p>
