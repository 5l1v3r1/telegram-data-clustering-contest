      <p>A boat conveying journalists across flooded parts of Sampou community in Kolokuma Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State on Saturday capsized and threw the four occupants into the water.</p>
      <p>According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the boat was carrying four journalists covering the governorship elections, including its correspondent.</p>
      <p>The journalists were returning from a polling station when the incident happened and left the victims submerged.</p>
      <p>However, the timely intervention of sympathisers saved the journalists whose mobile phones, cameras and recorders were drenched.</p>
      <p>Flood had submerged many parts of Amasoma, Yenagoa and parts of Sagbama, a development that displaced polling stations.</p>
