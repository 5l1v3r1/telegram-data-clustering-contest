        <figcaption>Prince Andrew regrets stay with Jeffrey Epstein</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Britain's Prince Andrew has claimed he has "no recollection" of meeting a woman who said she was forced to have sex with him as a teenager.</p>
      <p>The British royal said he could not remember ever meeting Virginia Roberts —<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uks-prince-andrew-appalled-by-jeffrey-epstein-claims/a-50077276">one of the alleged victims of sex offender and trafficker Jeffrey Epstein</a> — telling the BBC in a bombshell Saturday interview: "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."</p>
      <p>Virginia Giuffre, formally Roberts, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/british-royal-house-denies-sex-claims-against-prince-andrew/a-18168465">said she was forced to have sex with the prince</a> three times by convicted pedophile Epstein while in London in 2001, when she was 17 years old, as well as in New York and on Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>A widely circulated photograph taken around the same time shows Prince Andrew with his arm around Roberts' waist and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's alleged fixer of young girls, in the background.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Photo not real</b>
      </p>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth II's second son claimed that the photo was faked, although he said he was "at a loss to explain" the image. </p>
      <p>"I'm afraid to say that I don't believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested,'' he said. "If the original was ever produced, then perhaps we might be able to solve it but I can't."</p>
      <p>Confronted with Giuffre's claims that she went out to dinner with the prince and partied at a night club before having sex at Maxwell's house, Andrew said there were "a number of things that are wrong'' about that account.</p>
      <p>He said on the day of the alleged encounter on March 10, 2001, he had taken his daughter to a pizza party before going home for the night. </p>
      <p>"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do," he said. "I remember it weirdly distinctly."</p>
      <p>He also sought to cast doubt over Giuffre's claim that he sweated heavily at a London nightclub while dancing.</p>
      <p>Andrew told the BBC he has a "peculiar medical condition, which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time'' after suffering an "overdose of adrenaline'' in the Falklands War, the 1982 conflict between Argentina and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>"It was almost impossible for me to sweat,'' he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A serious lack of judgment</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prince Andrew admitted in the interview broadcast by the UK public broadcaster that he had demonstrated a serious lack of judgment in remaining friends with Epstein after he had been convicted of child sex crimes. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/prince-andrew-denies-knowledge-of-epsteins-sex-crimes/a-50153399">He said he remained friends</a> with Epstein because he was "too honorable" to have acted differently.</p>
      <p>"That's the bit that ... as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that," he said.</p>

        <b>'A convenient place to stay'</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the interview, Prince Andrew also claimed that he stayed with Epstein because "it was a convenient place to stay."</p>
      <p>Photographs and footage show the prince in the doorway of Epstein's New York mansion in 2010, two years after the financier's first conviction for sexual offenses.</p>
      <p>The interview is the first time the prince has answered questions on his controversial friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>Epstein was imprisoned for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy in 2008 and was re-arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019. He was found dead in his cell in New York's high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in August as he awaited trial. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/accused-sex-trafficker-jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide/a-49979405">Authorities ruled his death a suicide.</a></p>
      <p> <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/epstein-accusers-testify-weeks-after-his-pre-trial-suicide/a-50187271">Giuffre is one of many women who have spoken out about years of sexual abuse</a> as a minor at the hands of Epstein.</p>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>Fleeing poverty<br/></b>Our investigation began in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Almost everyone we spoke to has at least a friend or a family member in Europe. More than three-quarters of illegal prostitutes in Italy are from this region. Due to high unemployment among the youths in Edo state, many young women see fewer prospects here. They seek for a better life in Europe instead, not fully aware of the dangers.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>False promises<br/></b>Catholic Sister, Bibiana Emenaha, has tried for years to warn young Nigerian women before they ended up in Europe. "Many are lured with false promises," she told us. The traffickers promise jobs such as babysitting or hair dressing, but that quickly turn out to be a lie. Once the young women are in Europe, they end up on the streets.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>"The people are greedy"<br/></b>After long negotiations, a trafficker agreed to an interview with us. He called himself Steve and claimed he has already transported more than 100 Nigerians all the way to Libya. He wouldn’t speak about the people behind his business. He said he was simply a service provider. "The people here in Edo State are greedy. They are willing to do anything for a better life," Steve said.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>Dangerous Sahara journey<br/></b>For 600 euros ($666) per person, Steve organizes the journey from Nigeria to Libya. "Most people know how dangerous the journey is through the Sahara," the human smuggler told us. Many people die very often along the way. "That is the risk," Steve said, who brings the migrants personally to Agadez in Niger. A colleague then takes over from there.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>Agadez: A hub for human traffickers<br/></b>The desert town of Agadez was the most dangerous part of our research trip. The town thrives on human and drug trafficking and foreigners are often kidnapped for ransom. We could only move around with armed guards and had to wear traditional head cover to be less visible.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>Solving the migration crisis<br/></b>Like many others in the desert town, Omar Ibrahim Omar, the Sultan of Agadez, sees human trafficking as a problem that cannot be solved in Agadez. He is asking for more money from the international community. His argument: If Europe does not want more migrants to keep coming through the Mediterranean Sea, Europe should give more support to Niger.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>The "Monday Caravan" to Libya<br/></b>For months now, several trucks with migrants from Agadez set out every Monday shortly before sunset towards the north. The crisis in Libya has contributed to human traffickers being able to reach the Mediterranean Sea without the usual controls. And we soon learned that the authorities here in Niger have little interests in their activities.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>"The girls are getting younger"<br/></b>Many of the migrants from Nigeria land on the streets in Italy. Social worker Lisa Bertini works with foreign prostitutes. "They are coming more and more," she told us. According to official figures, about 1,000 Nigerians went to Italy across the Mediterranean in 2014. In 2015, the figure climbed to 4,000. "And the girls are getting younger," the social worker said.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>Looking for a "Madam"<br/></b>With help from a Nigerian colleague, we discovered an alleged "Madam" in northern Italy. A Nigerian host in Italy is referred to as "Madam," she is at the top of a smaller trafficking network. The madam we found lived in a suburb of Florence and one victim made serious accusations against the her: "She has been beating us and forced us into prostitution," the victim said.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>'Madam' and her girls<br/></b>As we confronted the supposed "Madam" about the accusations, she admited accommodating six young Nigerian women in her house, but denied forcing them into prostitution: "It's just something young Nigerians here do." After our interview, we handed our research to the Italian public prosecutor's office.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Tracking Nigeria's human traffickers<br/><b>Cheap sexual satisfaction<br/></b>Sister Monika Uchikwe has long been criticizing the inactiveness of the Italian authorities. For eight years, she has cared for victims of human trafficking. She explained in rage as we asked about the customers. The men always want cheap satisfaction – sex with a Nigerian woman on the streets costs only 10 euro. "Without this possibility, this problem would not exist," she said.<br/>Author: Jan-Philipp Scholz / Adrian Kriesch / abj</figcaption>
