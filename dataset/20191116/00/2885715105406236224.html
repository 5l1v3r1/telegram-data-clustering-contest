      <p>Senior advocate Prakash Jani resigned from the post of Additional Advocate General (AAG) of the Gujarat High Court after a decade in this position.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, the senior counsel said he had been planning to resign “for more than three months” as he wanted to pursue private practice.</p>
      <p>Appointed to the post of AAG on November 23, 2009, Jani’s resignation comes a week short of a decade, while admitting that the state government wanted him to continue in this position but acceded to his request to be relieved.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the legal cases where the senior advocate was representing the state government will be taken up by the government pleader or the advocate general.</p>
      <p>While Jani did not divulge the exact date when he tendered his resignation, he added that he had been discussing his resignation with the state and the first step in this regard was confirmed today although completion of the administrative procedures remain.</p>
