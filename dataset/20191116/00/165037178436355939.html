        <b>Karim Benzema will not put on the national team shirt again. Noel Le Graet, the President of the Federation Gala, closed the doors on the Real Madrid striker.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The 8th October 2015, </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/k-benzema-3318/">Karim Benzema</a> scored two goals and got an assist in France's win over Germany. At this time, the Real Madrid striker did not know that this was going to be his last game with the national team.</p>
      <p><b>The 'Valbuena case' closed the doors on Benzema</b> and, despite some stand-out performances with <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>, Didier Deschamps has always left him outside of the call-ups.</p>
      <p>Although there might be a slight chance of a return for him, Le Graet decided to shut this down. "Karim Benzema is a very good player, I never questioned his qualities. He is one of the best players in his position,<b> but his time with France is over," </b>he told 'RMC Sport'.</p>

      <p>A very big statement that definitely leaves Karim Benzema<b> outside of the France national team</b>. Since the 'Valbuena case' irrupted, the striker<b> has become an outcast </b>for 'Les Bleus'.'</p>
      <p>"Benzema<b> does a lot of stupid things. </b>He is a character that has no filter, but he is also very loved. You would have to be a little blind or deaf not to understand that it would be difficult to choose him," Le Graet said in the months after the 'Valbuena case'.</p>
      <p>In defence of the Real Madrid player, Zinedine Zidane himself said:<b> "Karim has always wanted to play with the national team.</b> I don't know what is happening, but for me he is the best and I'd make room for him."</p>
