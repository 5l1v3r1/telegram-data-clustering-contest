      <h1>'Hawaii Five-0', 'Magnum PI' to Crossover in January</h1>
      <h2>CBS dramas will meet on Friday, Jan. 3</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:33:54+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/reid-nakamura/" target="_blank">Reid Nakamura</a></address>
      <p>CBS will finally air a crossover between its Friday night, set-in-Hawaii dramas “Hawaii Five-0” and “Magnum P.I.” next year.</p>
      <p>Peter Lenkov, executive producer on both series, announced the crossover in an interview with <a href="https://tvline.com/2019/11/15/hawaii-five-0-magnum-pi-crossover-january-2020/">TV Line</a> on Friday, explaining that the story will involve the two sets of investigators converging on the same hotel. Lenkov described the event as “a big-stakes story that really feels like a two-hour movie.”</p>
      <p>The episodes are set to air back-to-back on Friday, Jan. 3.</p>

      <p>“Hawaii Five-0,” which is currently in its 10th season, and “Magnum P.I.,” in its second, are a natural pair for a crossover, with Lenkov serving as showrunner on both series and both being set in Hawaii. They have shared minor characters in the past, but this will mark the first time any of the show’s major characters will cross paths.</p>
      <p>“Magnum P.I.” is a reboot of the 1980s Tom Selleck series starring Jay Hernandez as the titular detective. Perdita Weeks, Zachary Knighton, Stephen Hill, Tim Kang and Amy Hill also star.</p>
      <p>“Hawaii Five-0” is also a reboot of a classic series, centering on an elite federalized task force whose mission is to wipe out the crime that washes up on Hawaii’s sun-drenched beaches. Alex O’Loughlan, Scott Caan, Ian Anthony Dale, Meaghan Rath, Beulah Koale, Chi McBride, Katrina Law, Taylor Wily, Dennis Chun and Kimee Balmilero star.</p>
