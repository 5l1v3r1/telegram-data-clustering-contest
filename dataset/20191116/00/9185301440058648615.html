      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin McKenna, NHRA National Dragster Senior Editor</a></address>
      <p>On the penultimate day of the 2019 NHRA drag racing season, Ray Miller III and Jeremy Mason joined the roster of sportsman racers who have been crowned Lucas Oil Series world champions. Miller, who has been a top ten finisher on multiple occasions in Super Comp and Super Gas, was the first driver to lock up the title and Mason followed a short time later.</p>
      <p>Miller, who has four wins and a runner-up this season, entered the Finals with a 687-point score, but could not improve since he’s completed his allotment of national and divisional events. Miller’s only challenger was Division 6 racer Brian Preszler, who needed to win the event in order to assume the top spot. Preszler won his round one battle on Friday but dropped a tough race against Allison McKoane on Saturday morning to officially decide the title in Miller’s favor.</p>
      <p>Mason locked up the Super Gas title later in the day after contender Jim Capp lost in round three. In a familiar scenario, Capp needed to win the race to win the championship, but his run ended at the hands of veteran Ken Mostowich. Capp slowed while Mostowich ran a 9.91 for the win, giving Mason his first title. During the 2019 season, Mason scored 644 points thanks to a win at the Summit Racing Equipment NHRA Nationals in Norwalk and a pair of runner-up finishes in divisional competition.</p>
      <p>The final championship to be decided is in Super Stock, with Vic Penrod attempting to hold off Kyle Rizzoli, who must win the event to take the title. Rizzoli has advanced to the semifinal round and will have the daunting task of defeating 104-time national event winner Dan Fletcher in order to reach the final round when eliminations resume tomorrow afternoon.</p>
      <p>Miller and Mason join fellow 2019 Lucas Oil Series champions Megan Meyer (Top Alcohol Dragster), Sean Bellemeur (Top Alcohol Funny Car), Frank Aragona Jr. (Comp), and Allison Doll (Stock). Danny Nelson (Top Dragster presented by Racing RVs.com) and Sandy Wilkins (Top Sportsman presented by Racing RVs.com) have also clinched their respective titles.</p>
