        <b>Newcastle Jets and Adelaide United secured valuable A-League away wins over Western United and Central Coast Mariners, respectively.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Newcastle Jets got their A-League season back on track </b>with a gritty 1-0 victory over Western United at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Dimitri Petratos sliced open the home side's defence and<b> Angus Thurgate</b> applied the finish in the 36th minute to end Newcastle's winless start to the season.</p>
      <p>The result was not secured without a particularly nervy final 20 minutes, during which Josh Risdon looked to have headed United level.</p>
      <p>However, a VAR review found Besart Berisha to be offside in the build-up and the Jets hung on with help from goalkeeper Glen Moss to inflict a second defeat on the competition's newcomers.</p>

      <p><b>Adelaide United earlier outclassed Central Coast Mariners in a come-from-behind 3-1</b> win in Gosford.</p>
      <p><b>Milan Duric</b> put the Mariners ahead from the penalty spot, but it was a one-sided affair following his sixth-minute opener.</p>
      <p><b>Ben Halloran</b> beat Mark Birighitti at the near post,<b> Nikola Mileusnic</b> volleyed the visitors ahead and<b> Kristian Opseth </b>converted a Halloran cross in the space of 19 first-half minutes.</p>
      <p>Central Coast tightened up after the interval but were unable to avoid a third defeat in five games, while the Reds now have nine points.</p>
