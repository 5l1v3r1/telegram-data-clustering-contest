      <p>GIVEN  the spate of protests in many nations nowadays,  one  can almost say  that  there is a backlash  against not only the  concept of democracy  globally  but  also a great  dissatisfaction with expectations of governance  arising from the elections  with   which those  who  run governments  got  to power  in the first  instance. Nothing  illustrates  this viewpoint  more  vividly than the  political  situation in Bolivia this week  where the President who claimed to have won a recent election fled into Mexico  for  political  asylum, as well  as the start of the Impeachment process in the US House of Reps  where Donald Trump is being held accountable  for  purportedly  using diplomacy and foreign aid to get his political opponent discredited with  corruption on the eve of  the 2020 presidential elections. Interestingly, the person Donald  Trump  defeated in the 2016  elections Hillary  Clinton  on a visit to Britain this week castigated  the British  government for  not  revealing  a government report that   purportedly revealed that there  was foreign interference in past UK elections  before the coming December  elections.</p>
      <p>These three  events in Bolivia, Washington   and London capture the  essence of the global  pressure that democracy  is  going through especially  with regard to the legitimacy  that clean elections are supposed to bestow on the leadership of those who  win or claim to have won such  elections. This is because democracy becomes a sham if elections are  not   transparent, free and fair.  In  addition technology  has turned the world  into a global  village and anyone who thinks interference from abroad or other nations in elections in any part of the world can  just  be shut out,  is behaving like the proverbial ostrich with its head buried in the sand.  Globalisation and information technology have made the world borderless more or less and  have  turned the concept of Big Brother is Watching  you into  a real  political engine   that  makes the world a stage in our small  phones and sitting rooms,   without us travelling out to the places we relate with on a daily basis.  Indeed  that explains why the issues we raise today  have universal  application not only for Bolivians,   Americans  or  Britons  but any citizen of the world in any democracy in any part of the world including our own Nigeria.</p>
      <p>There  was a time during the Cold War  when the policy of Non Inteference in the internal  affairs of other nations was the vogue in foreign policy  and   diplomacy. That era is   now gone forever, no thanks to technology and telecommunications. But  the business of governance  in  any  democracy   cannot  be totally be divested of  state  secrets,  confidentiality,   loyalty and patriotism . That  really is the difference between what is happening in the US Congress where the president  is being impeached and what Hillary  Clinton could not  understand in calling for the release of  an  election  interference  report on the eve  of the Brexit  election . Political  values in the US are different from those of the UK. Confidentiality is a well-developed and respected value in British democracy and its bureaucratic  establishment. It  is  not the same in US politics where the whistleblower is  celebrated  and  given  protection at the expense of state security and diplomacy. Hillary  Clinton herself was branded  reckless by the CIA  boss before the 2016   elections  for  using her  personal   phone  for state  matters  and would have been disqualified in Britain  from  contesting that  election . Similarly  the grim and treacherous spectacle  of American  diplomats and ambassadors revealing state   secrets and tele conversations between  heads of states still in office  would  not  have happened  in any decent nation but the US over the Trump- Biden Ukraine affair.  Obviously  the American  system  of checks  and balances in the Trump  presidency has become weaponised  and politicized to serve partisan political ends at  the expense of democratic values it is put in place  to cherish  and protect.  Even  if the House impeaches Trump  as it  is proceeding, the Senate which is controlled by his  party  will never play ball and  vote   to impeach him.  That  leaves the issue in the hands  of the electorate for the 2020  elections  which  is going to be about the way and manner of this impeachment  saga.  Which  is almost  the same script that has turned the UK  election   on December 12 in Britain into  a Brexit  election that has turned the electorate against Parliament  which  hitherto was  presumed to  be supreme  but  now has feet of clay for most  politicians in this Brexit  election.</p>
      <p>In  Bolivia  from  where President  Evo  Morales fled to  Mexico  one  can  see clear frustrations with democracy and  the electoral system as well as the electoral  monitoring  process which  has  been  internationalized  for election monitoring. Morales claimed he won the election but opposition claimed he rigged it.  The international monitoring body said  he rigged but a neutral body  warned the election monitors  not to politicize the election monitoring system. Who  then is telling the truth?   While  the army came in to create order and stability, the two leaders in line of succession in Bolivia  resigned  and  paved the way for a lady senator next in rank to claim  the presidency. The truth however is that democracy in Bolivia  has  been  badly  battered and it will  take sometime for it  to regain its credibility  and    legitimacy.  For now both the army  and diplomacy   seem    to  have rescued Bolivian democracy and   given that nation peace and stability  after   the post election  violence   and protests.  Mexico  gave asylum and the army pressured  the election rigger  to flee for his life and take refuge in Mexico. But  the army  has  never been a trusted ally of democracy  in any part of the world and the world will  be watching  when, if  and how the elections promised, will  hold in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>Let  us remember the saying that charity should begin at home  and take a peep  at the Kogi State election today. There is no doubt that state governor  Yahaya Bello has done a lot for his people.  But  that will be seen in the way the electorate votes today.  Already the President has called for a free  and fair election. This again is the only way to guarantee legitimacy for the winner of the election.  But  the Kaduna state governor  Nasr  El  Rufai  has taken   political   accountability to a new level  by reportedly prostrating before the people of the state and asking them  to forgive the governor for any lapses during his tenure That  may seem like  state cross border   election interference, but it is good  for democracy, transparency and accountability in Nigeria  and Kogi  state. It   also shows that in a democracy power is not  absolute  and is renewable at election time   and that  makes elections the time of reckoning for performing or non performing politicians.  The Kaduna state  governor  should know what power  is  about and how to  claim it as he was quite  hostile to some election monitors in his state  elections  who  wanted to politicize the election monitoring in his state.  Anyway prostrations may  be symbolic and even humbling but at  the end of the day  the ball is in the court of the electorate in Kogi state and it is them  who will decide the next occupant of the state  house in Lokoja. That  is the essence of  elections and that is the beauty of democracy   provided  such elections are free  and fair .Once  again long live  the Federal Republic  of Nigeria.</p>
