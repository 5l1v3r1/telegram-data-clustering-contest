      <p>Singapore - The technology group Wärtsilä and Singapore-based PSA Marine have agreed to collaborate in the <b>co-creation of smart technologies for the marine sector</b>. The focus will be on solutions that are human-centric and deployable. The Letter of Intent was signed on November 14 as part of the events celebrating the anniversary of the opening of the Wärtsilä Acceleration Centre in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Specific <b>collaboration</b> areas envisioned include the use of electric or hybrid technologies that further the use of low-emissions energy and propulsion systems; the incorporation of next-generation smart vessel technologies; the adoption of secured connectivity to facilitate ship-to-shore data exchange; and marketing and branding activities that generate awareness.</p>
      <p>With one dual-fuel harbour tug running on LNG already in service, and another joining the PSA Marine fleet by the end of this year, <b>PSA Marine and Wärtsilä have pledged to design and develop more solutions</b> for smart and low-emissions harbour craft. The intention is to integrate the deep capabilities developed in the IntelliTug project with new configurations and concepts of hybrid, electric, and other clean energy sources.</p>
      <p>“The Acceleration Centre promotes<b> innovation and joint projects </b>with qualified partners in support of Wärtsilä’s ambition of a Smart Marine Ecosystem that will deliver huge advances in efficiency, safety, and environmental performance. Our on-going IntelliTug project was the Centre’s first co-created initiative together with PSA Marine, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Lloyd’s Register, and the Technology Centre for Offshore &amp; Marine Singapore (TCOMS). This cooperation with PSA Marine is now being continued through this agreement, and we look forward to continuing our innovative and important work together,” said Mervin Ong, Managing Director, Wärtsilä Singapore</p>
