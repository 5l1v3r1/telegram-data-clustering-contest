      <h1>Dinan Brings Even Crazier Power To BMW M Cars</h1>
      <h2>Because who doesn't want to go faster?</h2>

      <p>You can't accuse BMW's current crop of M performance cars of lacking power. The F80 <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m3">BMW M3</a> has been around since 2014 and makes a scintillating 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque while thrashing all the way up its 7,500 rpm redline. However, more power is always welcome and that's why tuning companies such as Dinan exists. Dinan's latest tune for BMW M cars with the S55 code engine is now available, and it can deliver up to an extra 146 horsepower to the wheels, and an extra 155 lb-ft of torque.</p>

      <p>Dinan</p>
      <p>Dinan has been around since 1979 and specializes in BMW tuning, and has a reputation for retaining the car's drivability and engine's reliability <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/dinan-bmw-m2-was-built-to-show-the-m-division-how-it-s-done">while also adding gobs of power</a>. This new tune is available from Dinan dealers in the form of a "flash" reprogramming of the engine's software. Also, due to the nature of the reprogramming, there's a lot of tuning options available depending on what people want.</p>
      <p>The "Dinan +" tune, for example, has maximum gains of 58 horsepower and 51 lb-ft of torque (F80 M3 on 91 and 93 octane pump gas) with a factory matching warranty coverage, including the possibility of consequential damages.</p>

      <p>The "Dinan +HE" requires a Dinan heat exchanger to retain warranty coverage, and adds up to 80 horsepower and 88 lb-ft of torque. For maximum power, though, Dinan advises strongly to use the heat exchanger to gain full potential on the F8x BMW M3 and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m4">BMW M4</a> models and only offers a limited lifetime warranty against defects in the software.</p>
      <p>However, maximum power on a stock BMW F80 M3 is shown by Dinan on a dyno as 420 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. With the flash, Dinan shows its test car is making 518 horsepower and 549 lb-ft of twist. And that's using the original equipment catalytic converters.</p>
      <p>A big question is whether Dinan is going to tackle the B58 engine used on the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/toyota/supra">Toyota Supra</a>, as the company has confirmed that a tune for that is in the works.</p>
