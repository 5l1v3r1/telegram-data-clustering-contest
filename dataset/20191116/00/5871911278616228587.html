      <p>Basketball can be a dangerous games, as both players and fans know.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, just being in the wrong place in the wrong time can be a bit painful, as those who tuned in to watch Friday’s Wizards-Timberwolves game at Target Center found out.</p>
      <p>Wagner was just minding his own business being a good teammate on the play, as he set a perfect screen for Bradley Beal. The problem is that Treveon Graham tried to fight through it, and he ended up drilling Wagner right in the groin.</p>
      <p>The painful expression on Wagner’s face said it all.</p>
