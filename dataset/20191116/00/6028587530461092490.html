      <h1>Colleges And Universities Are Challenged But There Are Some Innovators Who Are Succeeding</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Lucie Lapovsky</a></address>
      <p>Colleges and universities face daunting challenges to their sustainability if they continue to pursue a “business as usual” model. The cost of providing higher education continues to rise for most institutions with fewer students either able or willing to pay the price. Competition among institutions for students has increased especially between public and private institutions; this is exacerbated by the demographic changes in the country whereby the number of high school graduates has decreased in most of the country and where fertility rates are at their lowest levels in our nation’s history.  Enrollment in higher education has declined in each of the last eight years. Compounding this problem is the change in the composition of high school graduates by race/ethnicity and a significant projected decrease in graduates from religious and private high. Within the next ten years, the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20191101-Grawe?cid=db&amp;source=ams&amp;sourceId=76290">18-24 year old</a> population in the country will be majority non-white. In addition, competition for private colleges to attract students will further increase with the adoption of “free college programs” in various states and localities; there are now more than 200 such programs around the country with 24 state-wide programs including New York, California and Tennessee which offers the most comprehensive program. The gap between the most competitive colleges in the country, those ranked among the top schools in the country, and the rest of the colleges and universities is growing both in their ability to attract and graduate students as well as in their financial resources.</p>
      <p>Resources are continually more difficult to generate. The average annual return on endowments over the last ten-years as reported by the National Association of College and University Business Officers is <a href="https://www.nacubo.org/Press-Releases/2019/US-Educational-Endowments-Report-8-2-Percent-Return-in-FY18">5.8%</a> which is 1.4% above the average spending rate of <a href="https://www.nacubo.org/Press-Releases/2019/US-Educational-Endowments-Report-8-2-Percent-Return-in-FY18">4.4%.</a> This does not allow endowments to keep up with inflation and is likely to lead colleges to reevaluate their spending policies which provide spending rates between 4% and 5%. Tuition at private institutions has increased by <a href="https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2019/NACUBO-Tuition-Discounting-Study/Tuition-Discounting-Study-Infographics">47%</a> over the last ten years while net tuition per student has increased only <a href="https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2019/NACUBO-Tuition-Discounting-Study/Tuition-Discounting-Study-Infographics">18.4%</a> as the tuition discount rate for new freshmen is now <a href="https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2019/NACUBO-Tuition-Discounting-Study/Tuition-Discounting-Study-Infographics">52%</a> for new students and more than <a href="https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2019/NACUBO-Tuition-Discounting-Study/Tuition-Discounting-Study-Infographics">90%</a> of the students at private institutions receive institutional financial aid.   Further worsening this challenging climate, the public is beginning to question the value of higher education given the large debt incurred by many students and the often perceived poor prospects for employment.  </p>
      <p>To ensure financial sustainability, many colleges and universities are responding by experimenting with changes to their business models. Historically, schools were advised to “stay in their lane” meaning that they should stick with their mission no matter how narrowly defined. The advice was just to execute better on what you were good at doing. Today, I think most colleges with narrowly defined mission statements especially those which are primarily undergraduate liberal arts institutions need to think very seriously about moving outside their lanes. There are some schools which have made very large changes to their business models and have recreated themselves as very different institutions from the way they began. Most prominent among these schools is Southern New Hampshire University which until 1995 was a relatively traditional college on 300 acres in Manchester, NH offering bachelors and master’s degrees. In 1995, it launched an on-line program. By 2002, the on-line program had 8,000 students and today it has over 80,000 students while the traditional campus-based program continues with more than 5,000 students. In 2009, it added the SNHU Advantage Program which allows people to work full-time and receive an AA degree at a 60% savings from SNHU’s regular undergraduate tuition rate. It has recently added College for America, a competency-based and project-based program which is to be “radically affordable” and workplace relevant delivered through employer partnerships.  </p>
      <p>Other institutional innovators include Georgia Tech which started an on-line Master’s in Computer Science in 2014 which it offers for $7,000 for the whole program. Georgia Tech has scaled this program and it now enrolls 9,000 students; it has the same admissions standards as its on-the-ground program. Tech has added two more on-line master’s programs – Data Analytics and Cyber Security which they are using MOOC technology to scale. In their computer science master’s program they have an artificial intelligence (AI) teaching assistant, Jill Watson who is highly effective.  Arizona State has partnered with Starbuck’s to offer the Starbuck’s Achievement Academy and has just begun the Global Freshmen Academy which offers courses to freshmen all over the world on-line for $200 a course and the student only pays after completing the course. And, the newest model is Purdue-Kaplan which brings together a nationally ranked traditional public research university with a for-profit on-line institution.</p>
      <p>There has also seen an increase in <a href="https://www.tiaainstitute.org/sites/default/files/presentations/2017-09/TIAA%20Institute_Higher%20Ed%20Mergers%20Report_Azziz_September%202017.pdf">mergers</a>. The University System of Georgia has reduced the number of institutions in the System from 36 to 26 since 2015 by merging 10 of its institutions. In these mergers, there have been significant administrative cost savings and increased pathways for students to degrees. <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/10/12/boston-university-wheelock-merger/">Wheelock College solicited merger offers</a> from 60 schools and six responded. It decided to merge with Boston University. Many mergers occur when another institution is on the verge of closure; this was the case where Mercy College in New York took over The College of New Rochelle when it went bankrupt. We have also seen several mergers of professional schools, law schools, medical schools and stand-alone seminaries, with larger, more comprehensive institutions. These mergers have often been motivated to provide scale and strength to the surviving institution. Beyond mergers, the number of institutional closures is on the rise. In Vermont, which has seen a drop of enrollment of 25%, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20191101-Grawe?cid=db&amp;source=ams&amp;sourceId=76290">we also have seen 25% of its private institutions close.</a>  </p>
      <p>More prevalent and smaller scale changes to the business model relative to activities to increase enrollment and net tuition revenue include changes to pricing and discounting policies; additions of new programs to increase institutional attractiveness, especially pre-professional and graduate programs; recruitment of new student populations including part-time, transfers and international students. Many institutions are partnering with third party providers to put programs on-line usually using revenue share agreements that minimize risk to the institution. These changes often take an institution beyond its originally stated mission. The majority of the institutions which have been successful in increasing their revenue stream from students have broadened their missions and many have strayed far outside their initial lanes.</p>
      <p>Greater enrollment gains at lower cost can be made by increasing the success rate of students who begin college. The overall graduation rate for students who begin college as full-time students at four-year institutions six years later is only <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=40">60%</a> while the graduation rate from two-year schools is only <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_326.20.asp">31%</a>. Most schools are working to increase the retention and graduation rates of their students. The <a href="http://www.theuia.org/#our-universities">University Innovation Alliance</a> is an alliance of 11 large public universities that have been working together to make significant improvements in these rates using a variety of strategies and working hard to significantly increase student success.</p>
      <p>In terms of changes to the business model on the cost side a variety of strategies to reduce the cost of running colleges and universities are being implemented. These include the continued reduction in the percent of full-time faculty which has declined from <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_csc.asp">78% of the faculty in 1970 to 53%</a> in 2017 and during the last forty years, <a href="https://www.educationdive.com/news/tenure-is-disappearing-much-to-the-detriment-of-higher-ed/417296/">“the number of full-time tenured positions has dropped 26% and full-time positions on the tenure track have gone down by half.”</a> The cost of one full-time faculty member compared with one full-time equivalent (FTE) faculty member made up of part-time faculty ranges from three times to six times as expensive.</p>
      <p>Beyond changing the composition of faculty, schools are offering programs in different formats including on-line and hybrid which increase accessibility of the programs and minimize facility use. Forward-thinking institutions are working to minimize their idle capital by using their campuses much more fully year-round. A few campuses now operate year round with three terms where groups of students are required to attend the summer term. As schools become more resource constrained, there is increased consortia activity to minimize costs in many areas ranging from health care, insurance and retirement administration and endowment management to academic programs with limited enrollment being jointly offered by two or more institutions. In terms of reducing costs to students, many schools are using open courseware instead of expensive textbooks and reducing time to degree. Successful colleges will need to look for ways to become more efficient in their delivery of education if they are to be able to maintain their quality as more and more of their resources are going to financial aid.</p>
      <p>Among the cost saving initiatives with the greatest potential will be collaborative activities among institutions and with new partners, public and private as well as the de-siloing of institutions. Successfully implementing such strategies will require trust among all participants and the recognition that going it alone may no longer lead to the best outcomes.</p>
      <p>But the bottom line is that the higher education industry will remain under stress until it can develop a new financial model to provide a quality education at an affordable price to students. Most other industries facing similar conditions would contract and we are seeing the number of closures and mergers slowly increasing but there are powerful forces working against closure. Colleges and universities rarely shut down given the power of tradition and faithful alums; we have seen the forces working against closure at Antioch Yellow Springs, Sweet Briar, and Hampshire.</p>
      <p>Are our students and nation best served by continuing to maintain a plethora of institutions, struggling to attract adequate numbers of students and continually reducing costs to keep their doors open? Would the industry be better off with fewer, better financed institutions?</p>
