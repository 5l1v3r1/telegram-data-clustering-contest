      <h1>BBC to scrap teatime Newsround bulletin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:09:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/anita-singh/" target="_blank">Anita Singh</a></address>
      <p>The BBC is to drop its teatime episode of Newsround, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/15/boris-johnson-accuses-bbc-interviewer-asking-difficult-psychological/">the children’s news programme, after more than 40 years.</a></p>
      <p>The corporation says it is responding to consumer demand, as children now prefer to get their news online.</p>
      <p>Under proposals submitted to Ofcom, the BBC wants to reduce the amount of news on CBBC, its dedicated children’s channel, from 85 to 35 hours per year.</p>
      <p>It plans to have just one news bulletin per day, keeping Newsround’s morning slot but getting rid of the afternoon programme.</p>
      <p>Generations of children have watched Newsround in its teatime, after-school slot since it was launched as John Craven’s Newsround in 1972.</p>
      <p>Ofcom has provisionally accepted the BBC’s proposals, which are now open for consultation.</p>
      <p>A BBC spokesperson said: “We welcome the Ofcom consultation and if our proposals are approved we’ll still have at least one daily TV bulletin of Newsround at the same time as doubling our online offer, which is where more and more children are getting their news.”</p>
      <p>In its request, the BBC said “budgetary constraints” mean it cannot expand its online presence while maintaining its current television news provision.</p>
      <p>According to the Ofcom report, CBeebies and CBBC have seen viewing figures fall sharply, with CBeebies now reaching only a third of its target audience, and CBBC only around one in six.</p>
      <p>Ofcom also warned of the increasing popularity of video-on-demand service such as Netflix and YouTube, and children's growing use of the internet.</p>
      <p>Whilst it said it intended to green light the move, Ofcom said it would only accept the changes if the BBC agreed to certain additional safeguards to ensure the quality of children's TV content.</p>
      <p>It suggested the adoption of a new performance metric to measure how successful the BBC's children's news content is, featuring measures such as availability and impact.</p>
      <p>Ofcom plans to publish a statement on the decision in early 2020.</p>
