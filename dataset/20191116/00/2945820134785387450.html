      <h2>Italian grabs his first front row start since Japan 2016 to head Ramirez and teammate Masia in Valencia</h2>

      <p>For the first time Andrea Migno (Mugen Race) has claimed pole position thanks to a 1:38.683 in Moto3™ Q2 at the Gran Premio Motul de la Comunitat Valenciana. The Italian beat Marcos Ramirez (Leopard Racing) by 0.274 on Saturday afternoon, with teammate Jaume Masia completing the front row.</p>
      <p>It was compatriot Tony Arbolino (VNE Snipers) who set the early lightweight class benchmark in the second part of qualifying, the Italian pocketing a 1:39.603 to lead Masia by a tenth after the riders had completed a couple of flying laps each. However, Migno and Tatsuki Suzuki (SIC58 Squadra Corse) then moved the goalposts as the duo shot to P1 and P2 respectively, with Migno holding a fairly considerable two-tenths advantage.</p>

      <p>Disaster then struck for Arbolino at Turn 2, a vicious highside on the exit spat the two-time 2019 race winner over the top and out of Q2 – thankfully Arbolino was back on his feet after a heavy hit. Meanwhile, having come into the pits, the lightweight class riders then filed out for their last pole position attacks. Doing so first was Q1 graduate and reigning Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup Champion Carlos Tatay (Reale Avintia Arizona 77), the future full-time Moto3™ rider slotting his KTM into P3 before a flurry of times came rolling in. Red and orange sectors filled the timing screens but there was one rider going faster than the rest: Migno. 0.3 up after three splits, the Italian took the chequered flag to regain pole position after Ramirez had briefly taken over at the summit.</p>
      <p>Masia’s second run saw the Spaniard pick up P3 on Saturday afternoon for his first front row start since taking pole in Argentina. Aron Canet (Sterilgarda Max Racing Team) was one of the last riders to cross the line as he jumped from P13 to P4 on his final lap, fellow Spaniard and rookie Sergio Garcia (Estrella Galicia 0,0) rounds out the top five. P6 for Filip Salac (Redox PrüstelGP) is by far his best career qualifying, the Czech rider reaching the top 10 on Saturday for the first time. 0.597 back from pole is 2019 Champion Lorenzo Dalla Porta (Leopard Racing), the Italian is followed by two Q1 graduates in P8 and P9 – Suzuki and Darryn Binder (CIP Green Power). Romano Fenati (VNE Snipers) completes the final top 10 Moto3™ qualifying standings of 2019 as Tatay and Arbolino slip to P11 and P12.</p>
      <p>Riccardo Rossi (Kömmerling Gresini Moto3) crashed at Turn 1 early in Q2 – rider ok.</p>
