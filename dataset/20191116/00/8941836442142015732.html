      <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - Afghan officials say gunmen have shot dead two federal prosecutors as they were driving to Bagram Airfield north of the capital, Kabul.</p>
      <p>Jamshid Rasouli, spokesman for the national Attorney General’s office, said two other prosecutors were wounded in Saturday’s attack.</p>
      <p>He says the prosecutors were heading to the prison at Bagram Airfield, which has held top-level <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a> detainees, including Anas Haqqani. He’s the younger brother of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a>’s deputy chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who leads the fearsome Haqqani militant network.</p>
