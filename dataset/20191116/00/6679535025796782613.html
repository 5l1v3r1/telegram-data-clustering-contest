      <p>Tributes were paid to 16th century saint-poet Kanakadasa and his contributions towards social reform as well as the Kannada literature were recalled on the occasion of his birth anniversary here on Friday.</p>
      <p>The district administration, various educational institutions, and other organizations also held special programmes.</p>
      <p>Presiding over the programme, organised by the district administration, Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa said by reading the literature of Kanakadasa one is convinced that he did not represent a particular community.</p>
      <p>“His ideologies are relevant for all time and everyone should imbibe his principles. We should try to emulate the ideals that he had spread through poetry and literature,” she said.</p>
      <p>Delivering a special talk, Anand Kurahatti said in Kannada literature, Dasa Sahitya has found a special recognition. Kanakadasa revolted against the inequality and tried to create a caste-free society.</p>
      <p>Prior to the public programme, a procession carrying the portrait of Kanakadasa was taken out. There were also folk performances.</p>
      <h3>Kalaburagi</h3>
      <p>Dattatreya Patil Revoor, MLA, said that all efforts would be made to install statues of Kanakadasa and Kranthiveera Sangolli Rayanna in Kalaburagi.</p>
      <p>He spoke after offering floral tributes to the saint-poet here and added that the Kalaburagi Mahanagara Palike will also put up portraits of the 12th century social reformers on the main streets in the city.</p>
      <p>Describing Kanakadasa as a multi-faceted personality, Basavaraj Mattimod, MLA, said besides his poetic qualities, there is also a social perception that he embedded into his works to remove socio-economic barriers. The poet strived to bring equality among people of all communities and to remove caste-based discrimination, there was a need to assess his contribution to society he said.</p>
      <p>Deputy Commissioner B. Sharat said Kanakadasa’s teachings should become the guiding principles for the present generation.</p>
      <p>Earlier, a procession carrying a portrait of Kanakadasa was taken from Nagareshwar High School in Nehru Gunj to the S.M. Pandit Ranga Mandir.</p>
      <p>Folk troupes showcased Dollu Kunitha throughout the procession.</p>
