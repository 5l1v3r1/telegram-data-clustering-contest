      <p>Former Boston Celtics great Bill Russell announced Friday he accepted his Hall of Fame ring 44 years after his induction.</p>
      <p>Widely considered one of the NBA’s all-time great centers, Russell did not attend his 1975 induction ceremony in Springfield, Mass., saying via Twitter that he didn’t deserve to be the first black player inducted.</p>
      <p>“I felt others before me should have that honor,” he tweeted Friday.</p>
      <p>One of those players was Chuck Cooper, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in September. In 1950, the former Boston Celtics forward became the first African-American player to play in the NBA.</p>
      <p>Russell said he received the ring in a private ceremony that was attended by fellow Hall of Famers Ann Meyers, Alonzo Mourning and Bill Walton.</p>
      <p>Russell was a five-time league Most Valuable Player and led the Celtics to 11 NBA titles — including eight consecutive — between 1956-69. He also was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and led the University of San Francisco to two NCAA championships.</p>
