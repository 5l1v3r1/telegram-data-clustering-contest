      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/crowns-and-unifor-reach-tentative-deal-putting-end-to-17-day-strike">Unifor members at five Crowns</a> affected by last month’s strike have voted to ratify a deal reached with their employers.</p>
      <p>Scott Doherty, executive assistant to the national president of Unifor, said votes were counted on Friday for bargaining units for SaskTel, SaskPower, SaskEnergy, SaskWater and the Water Security Agency.</p>
      <p>He said the approved deal still includes two years of zeros up front, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/tentative-agreement-at-water-security-agency-with-unifor-local-820">though all but the Water Security Agency (WSA) workers</a> will also get what he called a 1.6-per-cent lump sum payment.</p>
      <p>“We were successful in pushing back on the mandate and our members have overwhelmingly accepted the deal,” said Doherty.</p>
      <p>But the government denied it was offering a lump sum payment, instead framing it as hardship pay for striking workers equivalent to four days pay for active full-time employees at SaskEnergy, SaskPower, SaskTel and SaskWater.</p>
      <p>The contracts themselves use that language. They also note that part-time workers receive pro-rated pay based on hours worked preceding the disruption.</p>
      <p>Doherty argued that the difference is merely over semantics.</p>
      <p>“They can spin it however they want,” he said. “They want to call it something else? We call it a lump sum payment, but at the end of the day every one of our members got the equivalent of a 1.6 per cent lump as part of the return to work.”</p>
      <p>Unifor members received just $300 per week in strike pay for the 17 days they were off work.</p>
      <p>The WSA workers reached a tentative deal with the government before the end of the Crown-sector strike on Oct. 20. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/unifor-blasts-provocative-saskpower-posting-about-crossing-picket-lines">Doherty argued that workers at the other four Crowns who stuck it out to the end got a better deal.</a></p>
      <p>He said the WSA workers got essentially the same agreement that SGEU workers ratified this month.</p>
      <p>SaskTel subsidiaries SecurTek and DirectWest had already ratified agreements. Voting for the other bargaining units wrapped up over the past few days. For the SaskTel bargaining unit, which represents almost 3,000 members, voting took place from Oct. 28 to Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>Doherty said the deals differed slightly from one Crown to the next. According to a government news release, some received five-year contracts of zero, zero, one, two and two per cent raises, while others got six-year deals with an extra two per cent hike at the end.</p>
      <p>The fourth year of the WSA deal included a one per cent raise combined with a one per cent pension increase.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Donna Harpauer celebrated the news.</p>
      <p>“We are very pleased that Unifor represented employees have voted to ratify their respective agreements,” she said. “We believe the agreements are fair and equitable and provide for long-term stability for both employees and Crown corporations and agencies. Thank you to both management and union bargaining teams for their hard work and dedication throughout the process.”</p>
      <p>The boards for the Crowns must approve the deals, but Doherty said he believes that’s a virtual certainty.</p>
      <p>He said there were other measures to improve benefits in some deals, while SaskEnergy workers got some improvements to job security that Doherty was “very happy” about.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/expect-delays-striking-crown-workers-stage-downtown-rally">The Crown-sector strike ran from Oct. 4 to 20. About 4,700 workers were off the job at its height.</a>
