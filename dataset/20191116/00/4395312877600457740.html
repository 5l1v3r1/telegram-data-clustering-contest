      <h2>I used to view books like most people seem to. Books reflected my identity, added to my home, etc. An experience changed all that.</h2>

      <p>I used to view books like most people seem to. Books reflected my identity, added to my home, let people know more about me, were good for quick reference, etc.</p>
      <p>An experience changed these views. I started innocently. I decided to get rid of my most useless books, the ones I would never miss and kept for no good reason. Looking at my shelves easily revealed them among those worth keeping. Some were on the border. I decided conservatively to keep the borderline ones. I still got rid of a good portion of my books.</p>

      <p>As expected, I didn’t miss any books I got rid of. <i>Unexpectedly</i>, I realized that without the disposed-of books, the formerly borderline books seemed less worth keeping as before. I had been too conservative so did a second round and got rid of some of the once-borderline books. In this second round some previous keepers now seemed borderline. As before, I kept books on the new border.</p>
      <p>As expected, I didn’t miss any books I got rid of. <i>Unexpectedly</i> I realized that without the disposed-of books, the formerly borderline books seemed less worth keeping as before. I had been too conservative so did a third round and got rid of some of the once-borderline books. In this third round some previous keepers now seemed borderline. As before, I kept books on the new border.</p>
      <p>As you likely noticed, I nearly repeated the last paragraph. In real life I iterated several times over the course of a couple years, selling the books to my nearby book store Strand. For years I kept a few books, mostly reference books like a dictionary, thesaurus, Strunk and White, and the Feynman Lectures on Physics. Then I sold or gave them away too. I gave away the shelves too, creating more space in Manhattan apartment.</p>
      <p>At the moment, I have three books by other authors—review copies from publishers. I work hard to stop receiving them, but as a bestselling <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joshua-Spodek/e/B01MS9AX3E">author</a> and award-winning <a href="http://joshuaspodek.com/podcast">podcast host</a>, I get a lot unsolicited. I’ll sell them.</p>
      <p>I read as many books as ever, courtesy the library across the street, where I can put books on hold online, so I pick them up when they arrive.</p>
      <p>The experience led me to some unexpected discoveries</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I miss old books less than I expected, if at all</li>
        <li>My attachments to many other things decreased from the experience</li>
        <li>I use the library more. No matter how many books I own, the library owns more</li>
        <li>I came to understand my attachments to books, especially ones I thought I couldn’t part with</li>
        <li>My apartment feels bigger</li>
        <li>A physical book is different than the value of reading it</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The more important a book was to me, the more I learned about myself in letting go of it. Which leads me to <b>my biggest lesson from the experience: I used to see getting rid of books as losing something; I now see what I gained: freedom, both physical and mental</b>.</p>
      <p>Not that this is supposed to be deep. It’s the same freedom I get from letting go of any attachment, but books were so important to me it was a lot of freedom. My father, a history professor, continues to amass physical books, with all the resulting pollution. I recognize people look at things differently. As an author, I make my books available to readers in the form they prefer.</p>
      <p>Having heard my experience, my brother-in-law started selling his books too. We call the process “putting them back into circulation.”</p>
