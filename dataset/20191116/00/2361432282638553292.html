      <h1>Robert Downey Jr to Return as Iron Man in Disney+ Series 'What If?’</h1>
      <h2>Goldblum voices his “Thor: Ragnarok” character The Grandmaster in one episode</h2>

      <p>Jeff Goldblum — who plays The Grandmaster in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — may have just let loose a major spoiler about Marvel’s upcoming Disney+ series “What If?”: That Robert Downey Jr. (and Iron Man) will be returning to the MCU.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with Buzzfeed, Goldblum said Downy will voice Tony Stark for at least one episode of the animated series. Check it out for yourself in the embed above.</p>
      <p>“I played the part again a couple of days ago. I went to the Disney studios and I recorded the Grandmaster’s voice for an episode of a show that’s gonna be on Disney+ that’s called What If?” said Goldblum. “It’s an animated version of all the characters we know and love from Marvel and this episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man, so Robert Downey will do a voice for that, and Korg, Taika Waititi had already recorded his voice for that. So yeah, for a couple of hours I enjoyed doing that.”</p>
      <p>In case you’re one of the (we’re guessing) 1% of people who didn’t see “Avengers: Endgame,” spoiler warning: Tony Stark died after he used the Infinity Gauntlet to undo the universe-wide genocide Thanos caused in “Avenger: Infinity War.”</p>

      <p>In “What If?,” the series imagines alternate timelines and will even bring back previous MCU actors to voice characters in the animated series. However, these episodes are not meant to be “canon” in the MCU. The Disney+ animated series will primarily focus on alternate-universe stories based on the established Marvel Cinematic Universe films.</p>
      <p>Reps for both Downey and Marvel did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.</p>

          <figcaption>32.) Quicksilver -- Say what you will about the inconsistency of the "X-Men" films, but at least they're doing something interesting with Evan Peters' version of Quicksilver. The Marvel Cinematic Universe version was just annoying... and now he's dead.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>28.) Heimdall -- Now that <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/idris_elba/">Idris Elba</a> is an internationally beloved star, can we give Heimdall something fun to do in "Ragnarok"?<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>26.) Gamora -- While Gamora had great action scenes and the best-tuned moral compass of all the Guardians of the Galaxy, she wasn't nearly as fleshed out as the others. Hopefully this will change as "Vol. 2" examines her relationship with her sister, Nebula.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-incredible-hulk.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>23.) Hulk -- The famous "Loki Smash" scene doesn't change the fact that Hulk had the dullest of the Phase One Marvel films and is the least developed of the core Avengers. Maybe some one-on-one time with Thor in "Ragnarok" will change things.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Vision-1.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>22.) Vision -- Yes, he's charming, enjoyable to watch, and completely unique in the MCU. But there's nothing else to him yet. That said, he's bound to play a major role in "Infinity War," considering he's got the Mind Stone lodged in his head.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>21.) Nick Fury -- The MCU has now largely moved on from him, but that doesn't diminish his importance to the series. His debut in the post-credits scene in "Iron Man" is what started this leviathan of a franchise.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>20.) Falcon -- Sam Wilson has an awesome suit and great chemistry with Steve Rogers. He hasn't had enough to do yet, but he becomes the new Captain American in the comics, so there's room to soar.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>19.) Hawkeye -- Matt Fraction's spectacular run in the "Hawkeye" comics proves there's drama and laughter to be had in a story about a guy whose only power is great aim. But Marvel movies haven't figured out how to make the most of Hawkeye yet.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ant-Man.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>18.) Ant-Man -- Ant-Man's story arc about trying to live up to his daughter's view of him as a hero is fantastic. But he needs better integration into the wider universe. In "Civil War" he provided comic relief -- and of course a giant twist.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>16.) Black Panther -- T'Challa entered the MCU in "Civil War" nearly fully formed. He had the suit, the powers, and the wisdom to use them. It will be interesting to see what direction he takes in Ryan Coogler's solo film.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>15.) War Machine -- Rhodey's main purpose in the MCU is to be a foil and motivator for Iron Man. But after "Civil War," he has a long way to go before he can even walk unassisted, let along get back in the War Machine armor. Maybe it's time for him to have a story of his own.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>13.) Doctor Strange -- After experiencing the same ego-shrinking previously experienced by Iron Man and Thor, Strange mastered his magic to become the link between Earth and other worlds. He's taken a Hippocratic oath to do no harm to the MCU.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>11.) Star-Lord -- His wisecracking and womanizing could have gotten obnoxious, but thanks to James Gunn's deft storytelling, we see that Peter Quill is hiding the pain he still feels over losing his mother.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>10.) Thor -- His solo movies haven't been particularly strong, but Thor's culture clashes with mortals provide some of Marvel's funniest moments -- like the ones with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQPS7qOJ_A">coffee cup</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czCr113i0SU">Asgardian liquor.</a><cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>9.) Agent <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/carter/">Carter</a> -- When Marvel finally makes a movie about a female hero, it should follow the "Agent <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/carter/">Carter</a>" model. On the tragically cancelled ABC show, Peggy quickly dropped the title "Cap's girlfriend" and replaced it with "co-founder of SHIELD."<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>8.) Black Widow -- Black Widow is by far the most interesting Avenger with no superpowers. She's had meaningful moments with more members of the team than anyone else, and her friendship with Hawkeye has enhanced both characters. Natasha badly needs a solo film after "Infinity War."<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/drax.2.png"/>
          <figcaption>7.) Drax -- <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/dave-bautista/">Dave Bautista</a> has been the biggest surprise of any actor ever signed by Marvel. Not just a big bruiser, Drax is a blend of anger, grief, eloquence, and comedic social blunders all rolled into one. Judging by his "hug it out" scene in the "Vol. 2" trailer, Drax is only getting more wonderfully complex. <cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>6.) Luke Cage -- Though his spin-off series has been uneven so far, Luke is a hero unlike any other in the Marvel world. He's bulletproof but emotionally vulnerable, and a brawler who wants peace. Luke Cage is as down-to-earth as heroes get.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/spiderman.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>5.) Spider-Man -- This might be a little premature considering how little we saw him in "Civil War," but Tom Holland made a great first impression. Here's hoping "Spider-Man Homecoming" will give him the chance to recreate the emotional depth that <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/tobey_maguire/">Tobey Maguire</a> reached over a decade ago. Our only regret is that we won't see Holland duke it out with J.K. Simmons.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>4.) Rocket Raccoon -- You know Marvel is firing on all cylinders when it takes a goofy Silver Age character and turns him into a riveting CGI star with a character arc about overcoming trauma and rejection and finding a new home.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>3.) Jessica Jones -- The MCU has never had a hero with a story as sobering as Jessica's. She survived the car crash that killed her family and gave her powers, only to become a puppet of the mind-controlling Kilgrave.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>
        </figure>

          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CACW_IronMan.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>2.) Iron Man -- The hero that started this whole deal. It's hard to imagine anyone but Robert Downey, Jr. giving life to the sarcastic inventor tortured by questions about whether he's doing the right thing.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>
        </figure>

          <figcaption>1.) Captain America -- It was a toss-up picking between Tony and Steve, but we went with Cap simply because of how the Marvel films have transformed a dated character into a hero for our time. He's a super soldier, but superhuman in his basic decency and desperation to do right. Oh, and his theme song doesn't get nearly as much praise as it should.<cite>Marvel Studios</cite></figcaption>
