        <b>Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey have yet to start together in Wales' Euro 2020 campaign but Ryan Giggs is optimistic that is about to change.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ryan Giggs</b> is hopeful of starting<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/"> Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-ramsey-13124/">Aaron Ramsey</a> in Wales'<b> crucial Euro 2020 qualifier with Hungary </b>after using both players in the win over Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p><b>Bale made his first appearance in a month</b> on Saturday as Wales eased to a 2-0 victory in Baku that ensures their bid to <b>qualify automatically for next year's tournament</b> will go down to the final game.</p>
      <p>The Real Madrid forward has been<b> carrying a calf injury </b>and lasted an hour before being replaced by Juventus midfielder<b> Ramsey</b>, who has also struggled for playing time of late due to <b>a thigh problem.</b></p>
      <p>Giggs has<b> yet to have both players on the pitch </b>during qualifying but is<b> optimistic of that changing</b> against Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday,</p>
      <p><b>"We've still got to assess them,</b>" he said at his post-match news conference. "Getting Gareth off pretty early on and giving Aaron some minutes helped".</p>

      <p><b>"Aaron showed his quality when he came on</b>, but it's a quick turnaround. Gareth was blowing a little bit, which is understandable, but hopefully I'll have the option of starting both on Tuesday."</p>
      <p><b>Wales are now unbeaten in four Group E games</b> since back-to-back away losses in June and are within a point of second-place Hungary, while Slovakia are a point behind ahead of their game in hand against Croatia later on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Victory for Wales against Hungary, coupled with Slovakia failing to take maximum points from their remaining two matches, would be enough for Giggs' men to <b>secure automatic qualification</b> for Euro 2020.</p>

      <p>"We've had<b> four good performances in a row,</b> which we needed after the two difficult games in the summer," Giggs said. <b>"We needed to be strong and we have been". </b></p>
      <p><b>"I was not happy with the number of corners we gave away</b>, but they never really troubled us in open play and we could have scored a few more goals.</p>

      <p>"Depending on the Croatia-Slovakia score,<b> it sets us up nicely for Tuesday's game."</b></p>
      <p><b>Kieffer Moore doubled his goals tally in a Wales shir</b>t with a 10th-minute opener at Bakcell Arena, while Harry Wilson was also on target in the first half of a comfortable away victory.</p>
      <p>It was <b>Wales' first away win since October 2018</b> and Giggs added:<b> "Some of our play was outstanding".</b></p>
      <p>"Since the Azerbaijan game at home <b>we've improved</b>. We've played some difficult teams but overall the performances have improved". </p>
      <p><b>"We started to gain some sort of momentum</b>, which isn't easy in international football. The lads came into camp really confident. It doesn't matter who's come in, they've all contributed. </p>
      <p>"It's not an easy place to come, <b>so it's up there with one of our best performances."</b></p>
