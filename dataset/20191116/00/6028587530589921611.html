      <p>    While the spirit of antique jewelry often haunts many mass-produced “luxury” collections, their relatively bland designs and ready availability in shopping malls and duty free shops instantly exclude them from the consideration of discerning collectors. On the upside, historically insightful; rarified luxury jewelry brands do exist, and one of today’s most notable, exclusive and collectible ones is <a href="http://www.margaret-jewels.com/">Margaret</a>. A private jeweler established in Geneva, Switzerland in 2008, Margaret is the glittering brainchild of Oriana Sabrier and Candice Ophir, who create museum-quality, personalized jewels inspired by antique adornments.</p>

        <figcaption>Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the by-appointment only Margaret Jewels specializes in romantic ... [+] designs, like these diamond and baroque pearl earrings, that channel antique jewelry style into contemporary designs destined for family heirloom status.<cite>IMAGIE.COM</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>     Each limited edition Margaret design is hand-fabricated with painstaking techniques borrowed from great eras in jewelry history. For example, the interiors of diamond rings are clad in rich red gold, a flourish often found in the finest Victorian jewelry. The Margaret aesthetic can variously be described as romantically restrained, antique-looking yet freshly contemporary. Thankfully free of the sentimental, ultra-femme style and substance of most upmarket jewelry, Margaret jewels are available from luxury e-tailer <a href="https://www.modaoperandi.com/margaret-jewels/women">Moda Operandi</a> until mid-December 2019.</p>

        <figcaption>According to Francois Curiel, Chairman of Europe and Asia for the global auction house Christie's, ...

      <p>    As François Curiel, Chairman of <a href="https://www.christies.com/locations/salerooms/geneva/">Christie’s </a>Europe and Asia, explains, “It takes the talent and good taste of two young designers to rejuvenate old world jewelry elegance in the digital age.” Curiel has worked at the global auction house for 50 years and handled more jewelry masterpieces and important gemstones than perhaps any other living jewelry eminence. (He oversaw the Christie’s auction of the late actress/jewel fiend Elizabeth Taylor’s historically significant collection, which totaled $116 million in sales.) Curiel, who is also a member of Christie’s Executive Management Group and chairs the auction house’s Luxury Business Group, asserts, “Oriana and Candice modernize classic jewelry for the 21<sup>st</sup> century by infusing their creations with romance, excitement, freshness and relevance.” Given Curiel’s expertise, his assessment of Margaret’s magic is high praise indeed.</p>

      <p>     According to Sabrier and Ophir, “Everything we create springs from our passion for creating, wearing and giving the finest jewelry that contains meaning, affection and humanity . Time, secrets and talismanic energies animate natural gems, and we aim to imbue Margaret jewels with these powers. Jewelry is so much more than adornment,” they continue, “it can also serve as a vehicle for empowerment, as a good luck charm and with time, it becomes a repository of emotions and personal histories.”</p>
      <p>     During a conversation in their rose-colored private salon that hovers high above Lake Geneva (appointment inquiries can be made via the Margaret website), the two women explain their mission. “We aim to enchant people of all ages with precious, young-at-heart jewels that are also alive with a sense of history and heritage.” Along with their shared love of traditional jewelry, such as the chevalière or signet ring, Margaret jewels also embody other timeless sub-genres, such as the tiara, a universally enduring symbol of feminine power. Margaret’s tiaras, mesmerizing with their antique starburst designs, are as suitable for a millennial marriage as they are for a 50<sup>th</sup> birthday bash. Like all private jewelers, Margaret makes only limited edition collections and bespoke commissions:  21<sup>st</sup> century heirlooms that are the polar opposite of run-of-the-mill, rich people bling. And for those who prefer to crown their fingers, Margaret makes diamond tiara rings in several different styles.</p>

      <p>     While Margaret’s series of “Star” jewels is a 21<sup>st</sup> century update of the eight-pointed star famously worn by Empress Eugénie of France, Empress “Sissi” of Austria and Queen Alexandra of Great Britain, the brand’s “Spider” jewels are elegant meditations on the Victorian and Edwardian symbols of creativity. Margaret’s rings and bangles, set with hand-carved, antique cameos, are perfectly preserved portraits from the past that connect the wearer to history while looking perfectly contemporary. Margaret’s name-tag band bracelets, inspired by antiques, are made in white, yellow or rose gold, are engraved and diamond set with a name or personalized message.</p>
      <p>     Margaret jewels are hand-made in Geneva, to the highest standards of Old World craftsmanship, in a refined, body-conscious style that makes the pieces easy to wear, sensuous-looking and visually compelling. The gemstones are individually sourced by Sabrier, drawing on her gemological expertise and experience acquired while working for Cartier, Christie’s, the New York diamantaire William Goldberg and other <i>haute luxe</i> jewelry leaders. “I look for character and charm,” Sabrier explains. “We like subtle shades that evoke the look and feeling of bygone glamour, romance and gentility.” Ophir, a jewelry-loving marketing expert who built up and sold companies before joining forces with Sabrier, adds, “Our jewels appeal to free-spirited, independent women who are quality-driven as opposed to trend-driven. Our customers wear and collect our jewelry with great passion and an appreciation for how our jewels will become family heirlooms.”</p>
      <p>     The Margaret women also believe that to be a jeweler is to do more than design, fabricate and sell jewelry. “To be a jeweler means to establish relationships with people and their families; to create jewels that honor clients’ trust in us and that help them celebrate milestones in their lives,” they assert. Toward that end, Sabrier and Sophir are famous for pioneering experiential jewelry events that deepen the participants’ appreciation of high jewelry artistry and craftsmanship, such as staging a candlelit dinner and trunk show in a rustic Swiss mountain log cabin. Every February in Gstaad, Switzerland, at the height of the ski-season, Margaret creates an immersive fantasy environment in a salon of the Palace Hotel, such as an ice-frosted, flower-filled refuge, where the jewels are displayed for all to try on, and dream with.</p>

[+] Palace Hotel into an immersive, exotically illuminated, multi-sensory wonderland featuring its luxurious diamond, pearl and colored gemstone designs.<cite>IMAGIE.COM</cite></figcaption>

      <p>     “The Gstaad Palace is a fairy tale hotel,” says Andrea Scherz, the establishment’s Managing Director, “and Margaret Jewels perfectly complement its atmosphere by turning one of our salons into a winter jewelry wonderland that enchants the senses.” Exhibiting their designs within an original high concept environment every February, the treasures of Margaret magnetically attract male and female jewelry-lovers, mothers, daughters and others in equal measure. By serving complimentary custom-baked macarons flown in from Paris, along with other treats, Margaret makes it easy for visitors to linger longer and learn about the gemstones and artistry embodied in each lovingly hand-crafted piece. “Margaret Jewels transports our guests and visitors into a dream-like realm,” Scherz explains. In today’s globally branded, mass-produced “luxury,” jewelry-scape, Margaret shines with meteoric brilliance for creating <i>haute luxe</i> jewelry of unparalleled beauty and production values, while also offering artistic experiences that make time stop, and timeless, talismanic jewelry magic begin.</p>
