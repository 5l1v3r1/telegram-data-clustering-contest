      <h1>Watch: John Cooney Scores One Of The Luckiest Tries You're Likely To See</h1>

      <p>Ulster were under the cosh, but they got a rub of the green here. Opening their Champions Cup campaign this afternoon, the northern side were hoping to improve on what has been a fairly middling record in European competition over the past few seasons.</p>
      <p>They find themselves in a difficult pool with Bath, Harlequins, and Clermont Auvergne all having aspirations of reaching the knockout stages. Dan McFarland's travelled across the Irish Sea this afternoon, and they managed to score one of the luckiest tries you are likely to see.</p>
      <p>While they were under severe pressure from the home side for much of the opening stages of the game, Ulster would register the first try. They managed to block down a kick, where the ball would fall perfectly for the on-rushing John Cooney to touch down for five points.</p>

      <p>Grand if you can get it.</p>
      <p>Ulster reached the knockout stages of the competition last season, losing to Leinster by three points in the quarter final. That was the first time they had advanced beyond the pool stage since the 13/14 season, something they will be hoping build upon over the coming months.</p>
