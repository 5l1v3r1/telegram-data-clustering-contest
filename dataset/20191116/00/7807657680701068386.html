      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Path of Exile is an incredibly popular console and PC action game.</li>
        <li>A sequel was announced today by Grinding Gear Games.</li>
        <li>The team says that the story has become too large and they want to start anew.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Today, Grinding Gear Games revealed Path of Exile 2. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/path-exile-beginners-guide">Path of Exile</a> is an incredibly popular Diablo-like console and PC game that relies on only cosmetic microtransactions for continued development. It's free-to-play, but unlike other titles, it doesn't feature a single pay-to-win purchase. I've been playing it for years now and not only has it received game-changing updates, but the story keeps on getting bigger and bigger.</p>
      <p>Honestly, it's so big that it's almost daunting at this point. It's understandable that Grinding Gear Games wants to perhaps make things a little more accessible. However, the best part is that you won't lose any of your loot or current purchases. Just like the Destiny franchise, your character transfers over and you lose nothing. Well, in Destiny you definitely lost all your gear, but in Path of Exile 2, you won't lose anything.</p>

      <p>It's unclear when Path of Exile 2 is coming out, but it's good to know that it's in development. I believe the developers want to tell a new story first and foremost, that's why they want to create another game. Plus, some of the menus are other features in Path of Exile are slightly outdated at this point. Starting fresh, with a complete overhaul, might be the way to go. Plus, the team confirmed that they're overhauling socketable gems, allowing you to maintain your skills while upgrading gear.</p>
      <p>What do you think of this? Do you play Path of Exile? Let us know. Path of Exile 2 will probably launch on PC to begin with and eventually come to consoles, maybe even <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-project-scarlett-specs">Project Scarlett</a> by the time it releases.</p>
