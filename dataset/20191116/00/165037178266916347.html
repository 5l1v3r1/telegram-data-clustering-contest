        <b>Scotland might have trailed before Ryan Christie struck in Cyprus, with the Celtic winger admitting he believed the hosts had scored first.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ryan Christie acknowledged Scotland were fortunate to survive an early scare</b> against Cyprus, who looked to have taken the lead inside six minutes on Saturday.</p>
      <p><b>Scotland won 2-1 in Nicosia to leapfrog Cyprus into third </b>in Euro 2020 qualification Group I, although neither side can progress automatically to the finals.</p>
      <p>The visitors could have been behind before <b>Christie netted his first international goal after 12 minutes</b>, however, as Giorgios Efrem's shot against the crossbar appeared to bounce over the goal line.</p>
      <p>No goal was given, allowing Christie to break the deadlock.<b> Efrem</b> later equalised but <b>John McGinn</b>'s swift riposte clinched the points.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the incident, Christie told Sky Sports: "<b>From where I was, to be honest, it looked over the line</b>. I've obviously not seen it back yet.</p>
      <p>"We rode our luck a bit there in the first 10 minutes. It probably took us longer than we wanted to feel our way into the game.</p>

      <p>"<b>After that scare, we got to grips with the game</b>. The goal came and, from there, we were pretty resilient."</p>
      <p>He added of his first Scotland goal: "I'm delighted, obviously. It's something I've been desperate to do every time I've played for Scotland, and it's probably taken me longer than I wanted. It's nice to get it in a win, as well."</p>
      <p><b>Scotland play Kazakhstan on Tuesday but are already looking towards a home play-off semi-final in March 2020</b>, where McGinn hopes their belief will be boosted by wins such as these.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of new faces in the squad," the in-form Aston Villa midfielder said. "That's a game we might have drawn or lost in recent times, so it's important we get a winning mentality in games like that. Even though it wasn't pretty towards the end, it's so important as we build towards March.</p>
