      <h1>David Beckham 'shuns fish and chips dinner for cod sperm and jellyfish'</h1>
      <h2>David Beckham took the fish takeaway to new levels as he tucked into a dinner of cod sperm at his new restaurant venture with chef Gordon Ramsay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:37:47+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:37</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>David Beckham has turned up the Friday fish supper a notch with a delicacy in his new restaurant.</p>
      <p>The former England football captain has shunned the nation's favourite of fried fish in batter so that he could get stuck in to a plate of cod sperm instead.</p>
      <p>If that wasn't enough, Becks had a side order of jellyfish to ensure the evening didn't have a wobble in the middle.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old former footballer shared a series of photos from his London-themed restaurant that he is opening in Macau with TV chef Gordon Ramsay.</p>
      <p>It looks like the menu will have a mix of UK favourites but while Becks has said that pie and mash will be available, it is the Japanese delicacy of cod sperm which is the more eye-opening dish.</p>

      <p>Beckham shared a number of pics of the dishes on offer at the new foodie's dream, with seafood at the fore in the city that is dubbed the 'Las Vegas of Asia'.</p>
      <p>The cod sperm is served with caviar, which is roe or eggs from the sturgeon family of fish, so he is effectively eating a fishy 'before and after'.</p>
      <p>Beckham must have a taste for cod sperm as he delighted in eating it in 2017 and he was undeterred in trying it again.</p>
      <p>The dish is called Milt and is said to be comparable in taste to pork brains and has a soft, creamy texture.</p>
      <p>Before it is cooked, it has been compared to raw egg yolk.</p>

      <p>Beckham's restaurant will open next year and will be called The Londoner Macao and will feature a recreation of Bond Street as well as Big Ben and black cab themes.</p>
      <p>Included in the building will be a gastro pub that will be ran by Gordon Ramsay, as well as three spas and four health clubs.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Travel + Leisure, Beckham said: "London is my hometown, so to be able to bring some of the things I love from there to Macau – that sense of energy, humor, and attitude in the furniture and artwork — is a great feeling.</p>

      <p>"We're going to have everything from our iconic black cabs outside to mini-recreations of some of London's most famous streets inside, like Bond Street and Saville Row.</p>
      <p>He added: "Proper Sunday roasts will definitely be on the menu, as will my all-time favourite: traditional pie and mash."</p>
