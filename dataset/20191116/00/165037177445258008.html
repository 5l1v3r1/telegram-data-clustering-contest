        <b>Roberto Mancini's Italian national football team travelled to flood-hit Venice on Saturday, the morning after extending their winning streak in Euro 2020 qualifying.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The FIGC delegation visited several businesses damaged by the flooding, and chatted with Venetians, volunteers and police.</p>
      <p>"<b>Venice will overcome this too</b>. Like an athlete who suffers a serious injury and then gets up again," said delegation chief Gianluca Vialli.</p>
      <p>"<b>Venice is a wounded city</b>, but it is strong as well as being wonderful, and has shown great character and an extraordinary ability to stand up," said Gravina.</p>
