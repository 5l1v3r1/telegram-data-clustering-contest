        <b>After being subjected to racist abuse in Romania, Sweden forward Alexander Isak labelled the incident as "incredibly sad".</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Alexander Isak</b> was subjected to racist abuse as Sweden booked their spot at <b>Euro 2020</b> with a win over <b>Romania </b>on Friday.</p>
      <p>Isak, <b>20</b>, came off the bench during the win in <b>Bucharest</b>, with the game halted shortly after his 78th-minute introduction.</p>
      <p>While play was then allowed to continue, the <b>Real Sociedad forward</b> confirmed he had reported racist abuse to the referee, describing the incident as <b>"incredibly sad"</b>.</p>
      <p>"Of course it is sad for the moment, but at the same time we were prepared for such things to happen, even if it does not help in that way," <b>Isak </b>told C More.</p>
      <p>"I think I could handle it well and <b>the team's support was incredible</b> too.</p>
