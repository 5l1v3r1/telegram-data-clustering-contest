        <b>Raheem Sterling should not fear rough tactics against Kosovo, although coach Bernard Challandes acknowledges it would be effective.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Kosovo coach Bernard Challandes believes Raheem Sterling is so good a broken leg is one of the only ways to stop the England star</b>, but added his team are "too nice" for that.</p>
      <p>Sterling will return to the England team for their final Euro 2020 qualifier at Kosovo on Sunday, having sat out the midweek win over Montenegro following a confrontation with team-mate Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>The Manchester City winger<b> scored one and created three more</b> as Kosovo were beaten 5-3 at St Mary's Stadium earlier in the campaign.</p>
      <p>Challandes is not enthused by the prospect of Sterling returning with a point to prove this weekend, yet he insists his side will not resort to rough tactics.</p>
      <p>"<b>The bad news for us is that Sterling will play</b>," Challandes told a pre-match news conference. "He is one of the best in the world in his position.</p>
      <p>"<b>But [Marcus] Rashford is great, [Harry] Kane, [Tammy] Abraham</b> - England have a lot of great players. Whether we play against Sterling or not, we have to play a superb match.</p>

      <p>"<b>We are not dealing with individuals but with the team as a whole</b>, so we will be preparing for England. How to stop Sterling? <b>Maybe we break his leg</b>, but it's not our style. We are too nice. But we have a good team, as we have shown in this qualification campaign."</p>
      <p>The 7-0 win over Montenegro that booked England's place at Euro 2020 meant Gareth Southgate's men were top of the scoring charts in qualification prior to Saturday's games.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions' goal-hungry attack concerns Challandes, who added: "England have tremendous offensive potential, scoring many goals and winning 7-0, 6-0 and 5-0.</p>
      <p>"<b>For us, it is a challenge, an incredible challenge</b>. As a coach, I can enjoy this game but, of course, I am a little bit scared. This is the 1001st match for England, and it is the 29th for us. They have a little bit more experience than we do."</p>
