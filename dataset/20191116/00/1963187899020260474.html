      <p>CAIRO - 16 November 2019: Minister of Health and Population Hala Zayed announced that 80 percent of medications consumed in Egypt are manufactured locally while only 20 percent are imported. <br/><br/>In order to secure national needs of medications in reasonable prices, the ministry has adopted the Common Technical Document (CTD) system to support Egyptian pharmaceutical companies to register their products and benefit from a number of incentives pertinent to pricing and supply of alternatives. <br/><br/>In 2018, the ministry issued a decree allowing each pharmaceutical company to register any number of medications on the “Alternatives List” instead of just 12, including 5 imported medications.</p>

The source described the project as one of the most significant national projects.</blockquote>
      <p>Minister Zayed stated that local manufacturing made it possible to overcome shortage in insulin, and that it is is having a robust beginning with anti-cancer drugs production. The minister added that certain mechanisms have been in place to encourage exports announcing that Egypt has received a hepatic C medication order through the Unified Procurement System for the first time for an Asian country she did not name. Zayed stressed that is a great step for Egypt’s entry into the production of pharmaceutical raw materials. <br/><br/>The minister pointed out that the outcome of public-private partnership in the sector has been great as it is epitomized in the production of hepatitis C medication and offering it at a very low price compared to the international one. <br/><br/>That has contributed to the success of 100 Million Healthy Lives campaign aimed at screening Egyptians for hepatitis C and chronic diseases and providing treatment for patients, as well as the campaign taking place to diagnose and treat anemia, obesity, and dwarfness patients.</p>
