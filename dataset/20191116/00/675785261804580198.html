      <h1>Cheltenham Saturday horse racing tips: 5/1 favourite among expert's picks to win you money</h1>
      <h2>Follow this advice for the weekend's biggest races and you could be a winner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Masters, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/dave-masters/</a></address>
      <p>A 3pm inspection on Friday at Cheltenham to determine if Saturday’s action can take place didn’t assist an “absolute latest” 4pm deadline, but thankfully Prestbury Park has received the green light and Siruh Du Luc (5/1) can scoop the feature <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing/cheltenham/2m4f-grd-3-hcap-chs-2019-11-16/29584068.1425">BetVictor Gold Cup</a> (2.25pm).</p>
      <p>Now cynical readers might well scoff as the selection is a 5-1 joint favourite, but Paddy Power ambassador Lizzie Kelly’s mount heads the market for a reason and a 5-1 winner will make most people happy.</p>
      <p>The selection, who some shrewdies have obtained double the current odds about, gained a heroic Festival victory over course and distance in the Brown Advisory Plate in March and has won six of his last seven outings.</p>
      <p>He’s gone up 9lb in the handicap as a result, but any extra weight is compensated as he seems to adore the track having also won there in January and the bog like ground is not a concern as he seems to love a slog having scored on soft ground on three occasions.</p>
      <p>Siruh Du Luc is a massive price for next March’s Ryanair Chase, but those odds will tumble if he prevails here and that Brown Advisory Plate form is blue chip as runner-up Janika, who was also second in the January heat, scooped the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter on his seasonal bow.</p>
      <p>Big River (9/2) is quite appropriately-named for Cheltenham this weekend and Scottish sorcerer Lucinda Russell’s charge can land the <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing/cheltenham/win-or-each-way-2019-11-16/29584068.1350">3m 3f handicap chase</a> (1.50pm).</p>
      <p>There’s definitely a big staying chase in this lad as he ran a huge race in last season's Scottish Grand National when fifth and has been dropped a 1lb for his troubles, while his fourth in the Ultima Chase at the Festival before that was even more of a monster effort.</p>
      <p>That’s because the fancy was almost tailed off three out before staying on longer than a steam train and only going down by just over six lengths.</p>
      <p>Given Big River’s connections’ amazing success with 2017 Grand National winner One For Arthur, it will be no surprise for this guy to one day emerge as a contender for the world’s most famous steeplechase.</p>
      <p>ITV also broadcasts a couple of Flat races from ‘leafy’ Lingfield, but understandably we’ll stick to ‘the Home of Jumps Racing’ and David Pipe’s Remastered (5/1) will be difficult to topple in the <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing/cheltenham/2m5f-hcap-hrd-2019-11-16/29584068.1530">2m 5f handicap hurdle</a> (3.30pm).</p>
      <p>This Network gelding was a very smart novice hurdler last term and looks on a very attractive handicap mark despite a bit of a drubbing on his reappearance at Chepstow a month ago.</p>
      <p>Tom Scudamore takes over from David Noonan, who set a frenetic pace last time before his mounted was headed three obstacle from home, this time and this looks a lovely race to get him rolling again.</p>
      <p>Connections clearly think a bit of this lad as he’s also entered in a Grade 3 hurdle at Haydock next weekend and he could well be lining up in one of the big handicaps at next year’s Festival.</p>
