      <h1>These Actresses Are Bringing Awareness To Mothers Working On Broadway</h1>

      <p>For four years, Cara Cooper and Jessica Rush shared a dressing room while they were in the Broadway show <i>Jersey Boys</i>. They bonded over figuring out how to balance the demands of motherhood while doing eight shows a week. Ever resourceful, Cooper and Rush ultimately founded an online support group for mothers working on Broadway, Broadway Baby Mamas.</p>

      <p>They ultimately parlayed what they created into a podcast. <a href="https://broadwaypodcastnetwork.com/podcast/mamas-talkin-loud/"><i>Mamas Talkin' Loud</i></a>, on the Broadway Podcast Network, offers an in-depth, honest and emotional look at the joys and struggles of motherhood while performing on Broadway. “Dori Berinstein, a Broadway producer and creator of The Broadway Podcast Network, was aware of our group and approached us with the idea of bringing this support to a larger community,” says Cooper. “It was too good of an opportunity to pass up,” adds Rush.</p>
      <p>Cooper and Rush chat with other Broadway moms, including 2019 Tony Award winner Celia Keenan-Bolger. The actress who played Scout Finch in <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i> talked about doing the show while raising her young son. On their debut episode with Laura Benanti, Cooper and Rush discussed miscarriages, postpartum depression, and social media.</p>
      <p>How does Broadway make room for having babies?</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t,” says Cooper. “If you’re lucky enough to be in a show when you become pregnant, you’re able to take time off and they have to hold your job for when you come back, (if the show is still running), but there’s no maternity leave involved, so of course there’s no pay.”</p>
      <p>That policy doesn't follow what so many other industries are doing to help working mothers. Outside the theater industry, companies are competing to offer benefits for employees’ families. That can include a single lifetime benefit, one that employees can use for anything related to family-building.</p>
      <p>“More employers recognize the importance of offering family-building benefits as a tool for recruiting top talent,” says Peter Nieves, the Chief Operating Officer at <a href="https://www.winfertility.com/">WINFertility</a>, a managed fertility benefits company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Businesses that don't offer these perks will increasingly fall behind in the years to come.”</p>
      <p>According to Nieves, these benefits include fertility preservation (egg and sperm freezing), fertility treatments, genetic testing, reproductive behavioral health, adoption, or surrogacy. “More employers are waiving the definition of infertility as part of their benefit design in an effort to be more inclusive,” says Nieves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on Broadway, merely offering childcare to performers would represent a radical step forward. “The hardest part of being a mom on Broadway is childcare,” says Rush. “We don’t work typical hours and so we cannot take advantage of daycares or preschools, which are typically less expensive than babysitters or nannies.”</p>
      <p>Broadway moms face a whole host of needs most working moms do not. Cooper and Rush talked about those challenges.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jeryl Brunner: How do you believe Broadway supports mothers?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Cara Cooper: </b>To be honest, that’s still very much a work in progress. It’s still a somewhat new idea; the notion of not having to choose between a career in the theater and being a mom. There was a time when it was either/or. Now women are encouraged to balance family and career, so we’ve found ourselves forging ahead and dealing with an infrastructure that is ill-equipped and sometimes unwilling to accommodate us.</p>
      <p><b>Jessica Rush: </b>A shift is happening, but there is still much work to be done. Not to say there aren’t supportive people in positions of power, but it’s not the norm, and most often the support, unsurprisingly, comes from the women in those high positions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brunner: Are there theaters that do specific things to support moms working on Broadway?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Cooper: </b>It's not so much the theaters, as it is particular producers and the level of inclusion or support they choose to give. For example, Anne Quart of Disney Theatrical, herself a mother, is sort of leading the charge in ways, working towards each of the theaters that Disney shows play in having a room to pump in for nursing mothers, and working to structure meaningful practices around maternity leave policies.</p>
      <p><b>Rush: </b>There are some who have an open-door policy and allow our children to visit backstage between shows, or allow additional personal days to attend dance recitals or life events.</p>
      <p><b>Brunner:</b> From what source do most equity actors get their benefits?</p>
      <p><b>Cooper:</b> In our industry, you need to work a certain amount of weeks in order to qualify for healthcare, and that is provided by the Equity League Trust Fund. Adding a dependent to your plan is so expensive, that most parents find their child other plans on the marketplace and the Actors Fund is a great resource in helping to navigate that daunting task.</p>
      <p><b>Brunner:</b> What is the goal of your great new podcast, Mamas Talkin' Loud?</p>
      <p><b>Rush: </b>We created Mamas Talkin’ Loud as a forum for mothers in our industry to share their experiences. The hope is to gain visibility and offer support to those women having the very unique experience of being mothers trying to make a living in theater. In general, our society needs to be addressed more openly and honestly. For years, and not just in theater, women have felt the need to hide or downplay their role as mothers in fear of jeopardizing their careers, and this is something we are trying to change. Whether employed or not, motherhood is integral to our lives and women should not be forced to hide this part of themselves in order to be successful in their work.</p>
      <p><b>Cooper: </b>While Mamas Talkin' Loud is focused on theater, we hope mothers of all walks of life will find some value in our podcast and, through listening, will maybe feel not so alone on their journeys.</p>
