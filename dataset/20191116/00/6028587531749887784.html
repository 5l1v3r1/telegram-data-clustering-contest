        <figcaption>SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 19: Customers walk out of a Walgreens store on June 19, 2012 in San ... [+] Francisco, California. U.S. based drug store chain Walgreens has announced a deal to purchase a 45 percent stake in European pharmacy retailer Alliance Boots for $6.7 billion. The acquisition will make Walgreens one of the world's largest drug store and pharmacy retailers with 11,000 stores in 12 countries.

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/kkr-said-to-make-formal-approach-to-walgreens-on-record-buyout">Bloomberg</a>, KKR has apparently been considering to possibly buy out shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Should it happen, this might become the biggest leveraged buyout in history, given Walgreen Boots Alliance is currently valued over $55 billion (£48 billion). The potential transaction would most likely be done at a premium to the current market cap and also include the hypothesis of the $16.8 billion in debt the corporate has on its balance sheet. According to JPMorgan Chase analyst Lisa Gill, the takeover could “imply a maximum transaction value of ~$85 billion, which would denote an equity value of $74.97 per share.” The valuation was based on a debt ratio of 6.5 times. This transaction by KKR could make sense as the private equity firm already has done a deal with Chairman Stefano Pessina who owns about 16% of the company when it took UK-based drugstore chain Alliance Boots private in 2007 for $22 billion. A private takeover of Walgreens Boots Alliance would be a <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/lbo-walgreens-boots-alliance-skeptics-doubts-costs-51573069034?mod=article_inline">tough transaction to pull off</a>, due to the company’s size and the amount of equity likely needed to finance a deal. <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/the-firm/our-people/person?person=1000272">Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone</a>, said last week that a deal to take Walgreens private would be a “stretch” under current market conditions. “It might be possible,” Schwarzman said at a Newsmaker affair in New York. “It’s a giant stretch doing things over $50 billion.” “You need at least $20 billion of equity. Could you find that in today’s world? Maybe. Thirty billion of debt you could probably get. It’s a little tougher on the equity.”</p>
      <p>The challenge for any financial advisor will be raising the necessary capital via the markets of choice for private equity firms. The deal <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/walgreens-mulls-historic-lbo-just-as-debt-markets-start-to-wilt">would require</a> Walgreens Boots to sell ~$55 billion of debt, according to CreditSights estimates. If raised in the bond markets, that would amount to the biggest such auction ever. The cash would have to come from markets where banks have struggled lately to find buyers for riskier, leveraged buyout financing.</p>
      <p>Going private would help arrest the decline in Walgreens share price which is down nearly 10% this year despite the recent merger reports. This would take away the company from the public eye and could make it easier to focus more on in-store health services, which could attract customers and better place Walgreens to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-walgreens-cvs-comparison-20191108-2cogsqdlzvflbewsnb3qndhve4-story.html#nt=instory-link">compete with CVS Health</a>. The company would not have to answer to stockholders for the first time since 1927 as well as not abide by the regulatory reporting requirements of publicly traded firms. At the same time, a leveraged buyout would do little to resolve Walgreens Boots’ structural issue. The private buyout can limit the retail pharmacy giant’s financial flexibility with a lesser amount of free cash available for investment in the business.</p>

        <b>Walgreens is struggling</b>
      </p>
      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance has over 18,750 stores in 11 countries and has annual revenues of nearly $131.5 billion (£102 billion). The company operates in 25 countries and has more than 415,000 employees, including in the United Kingdom, where it owns Boots. The company accounts for 75% of its revenue from the U.S. pharmacy business. However, the company has been under pressure to reduce costs after the group posted a 20.5% decline in operating income to $5 billion (£3.9 billion) in the year to August 31, down 9.6% on an adjusted basis to $6.9 billion (£5.4 billion). Brexit uncertainty isn't helping Walgreens either after the company said that sales in its Boots UK stores were weak as consumer conditions in the country continue to remain challenging.</p>
      <p>Like other pharmacy retailers, Walgreens is facing pressure from a combination of weak retail shares and drug reimbursement pressure. Walgreens has been hurt by increased pharmacy competition from Walmart and Amazon, which now owns online pharmacy PillPack. Walgreens is also getting stifled in the front end of its stores by the likes of discount retailers like Costco and Dollar General. This, in turn, escalates price competition for Walgreens Boots with the emerging online peers eating into its pharmacy customers. The company plans to save $1.8 billion a year in costs by 2022 by closing 200 of its stores and laying off its employees.</p>
      <p>Under these circumstances, Walgreens Boots’ rival CVS Health embraced the growth-by-acquisition strategy to defy all odds. The company expanded through vertical integration by acquiring the health insurance giant Aetna for $69 billion in cash and stock, bringing one of the largest providers of pharmacy services together with the No. 3 U.S. health insurer. Walgreens contemplated to acquire AmerisourceBergen last year, but those<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/27/walgreens-and-amerisourcebergen-deal-talks-of-cooled-.html"> early-stage explorations ended without an agreement</a>. In 2015, Walgreens tried to acquire <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=RAD">Rite Aid</a> in a $17.5 billion deal that could give the company access to its 4,600 stores. Regulators, though, restricted the deal down to a purchase of 1,932 stores for $4.37 billion. Recently, the company has partnered with tech giants like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walgreens-ceo-stefano-pessina-on-partnering-with-microsoft-and-alphabet-2019-1?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Microsoft and Alphabet</a> to expand its offerings and compete with Amazon but these pale in comparison to drastic moves competitors such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/health-strategies-of-cvs-health-walmart-amazon-kroger-and-walgreens-2019-9?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Walmart, CVS, and Amazon</a> have made to add healthcare to their businesses.</p>
