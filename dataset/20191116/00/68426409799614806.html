      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas kept his nerve in the key moments to beat six-time champion Roger Federer 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the final of the season-ending ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas saved 11 of 12 break points and took advantage of an error-filled performance from Federer — who continually put his opponent under pressure only to come up short when it mattered.</p>
      <p>The Greek player next faces defending champion Alexander Zverev or Dominic Thiem.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, who is making his first appearance at the event, saved all six break points he faced in the first set. That included two at 5-3, when he needed seven set points before finally winning a marathon game.</p>
      <p>He broke again for a 2-1 lead in the second, then saved three break points from 0-40 in the next game before Federer finally converted his fourth to level the set.</p>
      <p>But the 21-year-old Tsitsipas broke again straight away with a forehand winner and then saved two more break points from 15-40 down when serving for the match at 5-4.</p>
      <p>He didn’t give the 38-year-old Federer any more chances of a comeback, serving out the match with an ace.</p>
      <p>The 17-year age gap between the two players was the largest in the history of the tournament.</p>
      <p>For Federer, it was a surprisingly erratic performance after he played near-flawless tennis to beat Novak Djokovic in straight sets on Thursday to reach the semifinals.</p>
      <p>He finished that match with five unforced errors — including two double-faults — but had 26 in this match.</p>
      <p>In the first set, he only lost six points on his serve. By contrast, he won 18 points on Tsitsipas’ serve but couldn’t force a break.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas was coming off a three-set loss to Rafael Nadal in his last round-robin match on Friday but showed no sign of fatigue.</p>
      <p>Reaching the final is another milestone in a breakthrough season after he also beat Federer on the way to the Australian Open semifinals.</p>
      <p>He is now 2-2 against Federer after losing to him in the Dubai final and Basel semifinals this year.</p>
