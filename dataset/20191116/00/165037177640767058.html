      <h1>Brazil and Argentina Under 23's recreate their own 'Clasico'</h1>

        <b>The Brazil and Argentina Under 23 teams will play against each other this Sunday in the Gran Canaria Stadium in the final of the III International United Football Festival Tournament, the last event before the next South American Pre-Olympic Tournament to be held in Colombia from mid-January 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>These two teams will face off from 19:45 (Spanish time) in an interesting test, <b>the most attractive of the competition</b>, after their respective victories last Thursday in the games that opened this friendly tournament.</p>
      <p>Brazil beat the USA 1-0 thanks to a 15th-minute goal from RB Leipzig striker Matheus Cunha and although <b>Brazil had enough chances to get a more comfortable result,</b> the players, coached by Andre Jardine, finally had to be confirmed with a meagre, albeit sufficient, score given the superiority they showed in the match.</p>
      <p>For their part,<b> Argentina were hampered by the late resignation of the Chilean national team</b>, forcing the tournament organisers to improvise a local team, mostly made up of players from regional categories, known as United Gran Canaria.</p>

      <p>Argentina, coached by Fernando Batista, resolved the matter with a scandalous win over the islanders (14-0, with seven goals in each half), in a totally unequal match that, anecdotally, had more goals (14) than replacements between the two teams (12).</p>
      <p>That is why the Argentinian coach's assessment of the players' performance will be<b> much more realistic this Sunday against Brazil.</b></p>
      <p>Previously, from 5.15pm, the United States and United Gran Canaria will play for third place in the tournament, for which the North American team led by Jason Kreis will be the main favourites.</p>
