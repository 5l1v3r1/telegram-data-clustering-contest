      <p>The Appeal Court sitting in Owerri has sacked the member representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe federal constituency of Imo State in the House of Representatives, Obinna Onwubuariri.</p>
      <p>Delivering judgement o Saturday, the chairman of the panel, Justice R.N Pemu, said the election that brought Onwubuariri of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/pdp-reacts-as-gunmen-attack-gov-makinde-wada/"><u><b>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</b></u></a> to power in February was not in tandem with the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended.</p>
      <p>The Appeal Court backed the decision of the Election Petition Tribunal that ordered a fresh election in the federal constituency.</p>
      <p>Justice Pemu stated that the candidate of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/why-inec-may-cancel-kogi-bayelsa-election-results-okoye/"><u><b>All Progressives Congress (APC)</b></u></a>, Miriam Onuoha, able to prove her allegations of over-voting, mutilation of figures and violence which marred the election.</p>
      <p>The Appeal Court directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw the Certificate of Return it had earlier issued Onwubuariri.</p>
      <p>Justice Pemu also ordered the electoral umpire to conduct a fresh election in the entire federal constituency within 90 days.</p>
