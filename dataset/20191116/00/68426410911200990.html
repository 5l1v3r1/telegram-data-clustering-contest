      <p>En route to his first career four-goal game, Jack Eichel scored the go-ahead tally with 7:47 left in regulation as the Buffalo Sabres ended a six-game losing streak with their 4-2 win over the visiting Ottawa Senators on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Ottawa forward and ex-Sabre Tyler Ennis tied the game just 2:01 into the third period, deflecting a Ron Hainsey shot from the point to make it 2-2. But Eichel came through again, blasting a shot on the short side and past Senators goaltender Craig Anderson (28 saves) to break the deadlock.</p>
      <p>Eichel, who added an empty-netter with 14 seconds left, topped his career best and only NHL hat trick against Carolina on Dec. 15, 2017. This performance ended Buffalo’s 0-4-2 stretch. Eichel has 12 goals on the season, and 10 points in his last three home games versus Ottawa.</p>
      <p>Anthony Duclair also scored for the Senators, who had won two straight and four of their previous five. They’ve lost three in a row at Buffalo, which got 21 saves from Linus Ullmark.</p>
      <p>The Sabres outshot the visitors 13-5 in the first period, but the game was scoreless heading into the initial intermission. However, the Sabres were finally rewarded 1:28 into the second when Eichel took advantage of an Ottawa turnover, then surged to eventually beat Anderson on the glove side to make it 1-0.</p>
      <p>The Senators, though, tied things with 13:56 left in the second on the power play. Duclair took a perfect slot feed from Logan Brown to drill home his seventh goal of the season. Eichel, however, was not done.</p>
      <p>Some 3 1/2 minutes later, the Sabres star drove through the slot and beat Anderson again to give Buffalo a 2-1 advantage. Sam Reinhart, who assisted on Eichel’s first two goals, has three goals and three assists in the last four contests.</p>
      <p>Buffalo veteran Kyle Okposo left the game following a collision while making a line change.</p>
