        <b>Roma are looking for a stiker and Moise, Kean, faced with all his problems at Everton, is one of the possible candidates.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/everton-fc/">Everton</a> <b>paid around 30 million for<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-kean-307752/"> </a></b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-kean-307752/">Moise Kean</a>, the Juventus star, but the young striker has still not scored and has failed to shine in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><b>Nikola Kalinic has abrely had continuity with Roma due to injuries. </b>With the need to strengthen their attack, Roma had thought about Kean. He is not the only player that they are thinking about though, because they also want to sign someone in defence.</p>

      <p>Of course, according to the information revealed by 'Il Messaggero' it will not be easy for Roma if they want the young striker.<b> Everton would like a return on their investment.</b></p>
      <p>There is<b> good understanding between the club and footballer's agent,Â Mino Raiola</b>, but the English club, despite Kean's<b> anti-disciplinary episodes</b>, has no intention of losing money.</p>
