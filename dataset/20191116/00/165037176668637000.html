        <b>The Netherlands booked their place at Euro 2020 as they survived a missed penalty from Steven Davis in Saturday's 0-0 draw against Northern Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ronald Koeman</b>'s side arrived at <b>Windsor Park</b> knowing <b>one point would be enough</b> to ensure they <b>qualified from Group C.</b></p>
      <p>They achieved that goal thanks to <b>a stroke of luck</b> when <b>Northern Ireland</b> captain <b>Davis blasted his first-half penalty high over the bar.</b></p>
      <p>The <b>Netherlands </b>had failed to qualify for the<b> Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup</b>, so this was a cathartic moment for a country with such a rich football heritage.</p>
      <p><b>They sit second in the group,</b> two points behind leaders Germany with one match left.</p>
      <p>Whether the current crop, headlined by<b> Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt,</b> are good enough to emulate the Netherlands side that won the 1988 European Championship thanks to the brilliance of<b> Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten</b> is another matter.</p>
      <p>This was at least <b>a step in the right direction</b> for an emerging young team that <b>lost to Portugal in the Nations League final</b> in June.</p>
      <p>Third-placed Northern Ireland cannot qualify via the group stage now, but they <b>are assured of a place in the play-offs</b> in March.</p>
      <p>It was a frustrating night for Northern Ireland manager <b>Michael O'Neill,</b> in what could be <b>his last home game in charge</b> after he was appointed<b> Stoke boss</b> recently.</p>
      <p>O'Neill, who will manage both Stoke and his country until after the play-offs, had <b>hoped for revenge over Koeman</b> after he branded Northern Ireland's tactics<b> "terrible" and "outrageous to watch"</b> following the Netherlands' 3-1 victory in October.</p>

      <p>This time, Koeman was without injured Lyon forward <b>Memphis Depay</b> and ill Liverpool midfielder <b>Georginio Wijnaldum</b> and they almost fell behind in the opening moments when keeper <b>Jasper Cillessen took too long to clear.</b></p>
      <p>Although<b> Corry Evans</b> blocked the ball, it didn't land in time to slot into the empty net and <b>the Dutch averted the danger.</b></p>
      <p><b>Josh Magennis headed just wide </b>from Paddy McNair's cross and <b>Jonny Evans couldn't keep his header on target </b>as Northern Ireland piled on the pressure.</p>
      <p>Despite their <b>early struggles at the back,</b> Steven Berghuis was inches away from putting the Netherlands in front when he met <b>Quincy Promes' pass</b> with a close-range shot that looped onto the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Finding their rhythm,<b> the visitors threatened and created a series of chances</b> in quick succession.</p>
      <p><b>Ryan Babel</b> forced two good saves from <b>Bailey Peacock-Farrell </b>either side of a Promes curler that flashed narrowly wide.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland were<b> gifted a golden opportunity to take the lead</b> after 30 minutes when<b> Joel Veltman was ruled to have handled McNair's cross </b>in the area under pressure from George Saville.</p>
      <p>Making his<b> 116th appearance as he became the United Kingdom's most capped midfielder,</b> Davis had the chance for a night to remember when he stepped up to take the penalty.</p>
      <p>But, after a lengthy protest from Cillessen, the <b>Rangers star blazed his spot-kick</b> into the stands.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands <b>looked to make the most of that escape</b> in the second half and Babel beat Craig Cathcart in the air, but his header was saved by Peacock-Farrell.</p>
      <p>With chances at a premium after the break, <b>the Dutch eased to the point that guaranteed </b>they ended their six-year absence from the major tournaments.</p>
