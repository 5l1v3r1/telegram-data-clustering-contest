      <p>JERUSALEM — Israel says its missile defences have intercepted two rockets fired from the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>The firings early Saturday raise more doubts about the fate of a fragile cease-fire that was announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian-brokered lull ended two days of escalation between Israel and the Islamic Jihad.</p>
      <p>A rare Israeli targeted killing of a senior commander from the Iranian-backed group triggered the worst bout of cross-border fighting in years.</p>
      <p>Hamas, the larger Islamic group controlling Gaza, stayed on the sideline, fearing its participation could cause an all-out war.</p>
      <p>The Islamic Jihad said it launched hundreds of rockets toward Israel in retaliation for the killing of the commander Bahaa Abu el-Atta.</p>
      <p>Subsequent Israeli airstrikes killed 34 Palestinians, including eight children and three women. There were no Israeli deaths.</p>
