      <p>Few companies are as ubiquitous in their respective markets as Tencent, the tech giant behind the popular Chinese social media application, WeChat. Informally known as China’s ‘app for everything,’ WeChat offers functionality far beyond that of other social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. Users can send messages, shop online, do online banking, and now, thanks to Alan Lau, Chairman and CEO of WeSure, they can even buy insurance. Tencent’s FinTech subsidiary WeSure makes it possible for users to buy insurance products without ever leaving the WeChat ecosystem. Despite the fact that Tencent is one of the largest tech companies in the world—it was the first Asian tech firm to be valued $500 billion—Lau still had to build WeSure from the ground up.  </p>
      <p>“It’s very much a start-up,” Lau said. “When I got there, there was nothing. I had to think of a name and build our team. We’re at about 400 people now.”</p>
      <p>The unique nature of the insurance market in China was a key consideration for Lau as he began building WeSure. The Chinese population has historically been very skeptical of insurance companies, and as a result they tend to be under-insured relative to the rest of the world. </p>
      <p>Lau believes that WeSure is in a position to reverse the Chinese reluctance to purchase insurance.  </p>
      <p>“There is a real opportunity to make insurance easy, accessible, and relatable, in a market where penetration is very low, where healthcare is difficult to access, and where everyone needs insurance,” he affirmed. </p>
      <p>WeSure also takes into account the limitations of online retail—particularly retail through mobile phones with limited real estate to display information. Simplicity is key in capturing the user’s attention.</p>
      <p>“We don’t sell overly complicated products, we try to keep it simple because our customers don’t have 30 minutes to spend with an agent so that they can explain it to them,” Lau reasoned. “Most people only have two minutes to understand the product and we have to work to make it catch their attention right then and there.</p>
      <p>To convince insurance-adverse users, Lau focuses on leveraging data analytics and implementing innovative strategies to enhance user experiences. For example, WeSure offers their health insurance customers discounts on future payments if they maintain a certain level of physical activity each day. By frequently engaging with their users, WeSure hopes to build strong customer relationships that will help them outperform competitors.</p>
      <p>“We try to build an entire ecosystem around each of the three major areas—health, auto, and travel—as a way to engage with people,” Lau said.</p>
      <p>The company’s approach is clearly working. Since their public-facing launch at the beginning of 2018, they have amassed over 20 million monthly active users and they have a customer satisfaction rate of over 95 per cent. Lau credits the lessons he learned during his 19-year tenure at McKinsey with his success. As a senior partner, he founded 3 new divisions within the firm, including their digital consulting practice.</p>
      <p>“What I did at McKinsey has been so incredibly helpful,” he said. “I learned to think from a CEO’s point of view, how to manage teams, manage change, and make things happen.”</p>
      <p>Lau is determined to follow WeSure’s impressive growth trajectory in the years to come, and he cites the social impact of his work as a key source of his motivation. </p>
      <p>“I really feel that there is a strong sense of mission in my work,” he said. “I know that at WeSure we have the opportunity to protect over 1 billion people and give them help when they need it the most. Unless I were Bill Gates, I don’t think I would have another chance to be in a company where I could help 1 billion people.”</p>
      <p>When he is not busy growing WeSure, Lau dedicates his time to the advancement of the fine arts. He serves as the Co-Chair of the Asia Pacific Acquisition Committee for the Tate museum in London, one of the world’s leading contemporary art institutions, where he leads the organization’s selection and acquisition of Asian artwork. He also sits on the boards of several museums and art institutions, and is a seasoned collector in his own right.   </p>
      <p>“I love the different way of looking at life that I get from enjoying art and meeting artists,” Lau said. “When I first started collecting art it was simply to put something on the wall, but now I feel that I’m able to tell a unique story through my collection.”</p>
