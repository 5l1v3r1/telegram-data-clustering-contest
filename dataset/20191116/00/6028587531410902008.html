      <p>More information is not always a good thing. You may not want to know what your friend does in the bathroom. Or what your family members do in the bedroom. Or what your baby is doing at all times.After all, if you do get a baby monitor, this is what you may end up seeing:</p>
      <p>Comforting, no? Alexa, how do you perform an exorcism?</p>
      <p>It may be easy to see the advantages of getting a baby monitor. A baby monitor would allow you to catch any problems that your baby may be having while you are in another room. It can help you determine when your baby needs to be fed or has laid a deuce in the diaper. This can be particularly helpful if you are too far to hear your baby cry like if you live in a gigantic medieval castle. Even if your baby doesn’t end up having any major issues, being able to see your baby on a monitor can offer you peace of mind and help you sleep better. It can even provide you with some reality TV. Then there’s the option of staying in the safety of another room while your baby rains down fire and brimstone or cuts through metal with his or her laser eyes.</p>
      <p>But not everyone needs to get a baby monitor. Certainly if you already sleep in the same room as your baby, why watch the monitor when you can watch the baby himself or herself. That would be like trying to catch a concert on live-stream when you are already at the concert. Moreover, seeing your baby’s every move may not be the healthiest thing for you or your baby. It can keep you from getting the occasional break that you need from parenting. It can heighten your paranoia and make you obsess over details that you see like your baby not lying quite right, making a murmuring sound that sounds slightly off, or having his or head turn completely around a la the movie <i>The Exorcist</i>. Remember many, many babies including potentially you survived infant-hood before baby monitors became a thing. And you turned out sort of OK, right?</p>
      <p>A baby monitor can also get you used to seeing your baby 24/7 and make you wonder when constant monitoring can stop. When your baby is one year old, three years old, or eighteen years old? Often, the recommendation is one year of age, although many parents do choose to maintain monitoring until age three. If you are continuing to monitor your baby at 24 years of age, please see your doctor.</p>
      <p>Plus, not all baby monitors have been rigorously tested, so their features may not work correctly. Therefore, using a baby monitor can give you a false sense of security as this CDC news segment explained:</p>
      <p>Ultimately, whether to get a baby monitor should be a personal choice, depending your assessment of the pros and cons and your understanding of your situation and personality. After all, there are some things that you may or may not want to see. Some of it may be misleading, and some of it may be spot on:</p>
