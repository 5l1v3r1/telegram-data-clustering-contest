      <h3>The upcoming TVS Zeppelin 220 will be the first cruiser motorcycle from brand and it will rival directly against the Bajaj Avenger 220</h3>
      <p>TVS Zeppelin 220 concept was showcased first at the 2018 Auto Expo. The production variant of the Zeppelin will be the first cruiser model to join the TVS Motors lineup early next year and it will rival the likes of Bajaj Avenger and RE Thunderbird.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here are the five things that you need to know about the upcoming Zeppelin cruiser.</b>
      </p>
      <h4>1. Will get a sporty design</h4>
      <p>The concept model showcased at the Auto show carried a sporty design with an LED headlamp at the front, wide handlebar, fully digital instrument cluster, long fuel tank, a comfortable rider seat and a raised pillion seat.</p>
      <p>The concept bike also had a sharp tail section, while the engine bay featured a dash of silver. The Zeppelin concept featured a belt-drive, however, expect the production variant of the cruiser to get a chain drive to keep the pricing aggressive.</p>

      <p>The upcoming Zeppelin cruiser will be powered by a 220cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, fuel-injected engine which will likely be derived from the Apache RTR 200 4V engine. The concept model showcased at the show was good for 20 hp of peak power at 8,500 rpm and 18.5 Nm of peak torque 7,000 rpm.</p>
      <p>The engine will be coupled with a five-speed gearbox. The concept model showcased at the show featured an electric-boost system which will help improve the fuel efficiency figures. However, this feature will not make it to the production variant.</p>
      <h4>4. Suspension and brakes</h4>

The braking duties of the motorcycle will be handled by a disc brake on both ends. A single or a dual-channel ABS will also be offered as a standard for the safety of the rider.</p>
