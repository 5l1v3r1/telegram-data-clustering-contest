      <p>While I am just a few days away from getting the Undying title, you technically can already get Harbinger, now that the dungeon has arrived, as everything you need from the moon is present and accounted for. The problem? <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=harbinger+triumphs&amp;oq=harbing&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0j69i57j69i60l3.1318j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">When you Google what the Harbinger triumphs are</a>, most of the top results are ads for paid “Seal carriers” where someone will do it for you for the low, low price of hundreds of dollars, which seems wild.In an effort to knock those down the Google front page, I am going to write my own Harbinger Title triumph list and guide here real quick, as hopefully this will help you get the Seal the legit way instead of paying some rando and/or scam site to do it for you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Lunar Rover (Badge)</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, this one is sort of complicated because it actually contains some of the other triumphs on this list, as the items required for the “Moon Gear badge” are rewards for many of them.</p>
      <p>You need the Moonrider One sparrow from doing all of Eris’s lost fireteam quests. You need the Pulse Rifle which only drops from the dungeon. The Bane of Tyrants ship is a random dungeon drop with a very low chance. I got it my first try, don’t be mad. The other random ones we will get to over the course of this guide.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Nightmare Hunt Time Trial Master</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is probably one of the hardest triumphs on the list. You need to beat every Nightmare Hunt on Master in a set amount of time, except the game doesn’t tell you how <i>much</i> time. Enter my friend <a href="https://www.niris.tv/blog/nightmare-hunts">Niris</a>, master of infographics, who has all the times listed below which he’s gathered after community testing:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This will get you the A Sibyl’s Dreams emblem that you need for the Lunar Rover badge. This is going to take a lot of trial and error, and beware the boss phases and their repeated immunity that makes them very hard to burst down in most instances.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Flawless Master Hunter Nightmare</b>
      </p>
      <p>All you have to do is beat <i>one</i> Master Nightmare Hunt without dying here, which is not too bad. Pick your favorite and go for it. This gets you the Lunar Halcyon Gilt shader you need for the collection badge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Symphony of Death</b>
      </p>
      <p>You need to complete the Deathbringer quest for the exotic launcher that you get after the main moon questline wraps. Here’s a guide from Rick Kackis walking you through the entire thing:</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Altar’s of Sorrow: Sorrow’s Bane</b>
      </p>
      <p>This gets you the ship The Third Tale for collections which is given for a “perfect” Altars of Sorrow run where no Nightmares get sacrificed, aka they do not make it to the glowing green thing from the other glowing green thing. Hard, but doable. You want a good team.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Eternal Heretic</b>
      </p>
      <p>You have to do a flawless run of the new dungeon to get this one. Not solo, but flawless, no deaths. I hear transition glitch deaths do not count against this.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Usurper</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Now</i> you have to do a solo dungeon run, but it doesn’t have to be flawless. This one you probably do need an actual guide for, so here’s how Gladd did it:</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Lost No More</b>
      </p>
      <p>You have to find all the lost ghosts on the moon which actually talk to you and have good lore. This gets you the Moonrider One sparrow for the badge. Here’s a guide to their locations from Esoterickk</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. Let Them Eat Rice Cakes</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is feeding Rice Cakes to all the Jade Rabbit statues on the map, similar to feeding cats in the Dreaming City. This gets you the Lunar Gloom shader even though it doesn’t say it in the triumph for some reason. Here’s another guide from Esoterickk for this one:</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Wandering Nightmares</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each week a different Nightmare will be on the map somewhere that you spawn manually and it shows up at 980. There are four in total. You can solo most if you’re high enough, though you might want to bring a friend. Here’s the locations of all of them from WoW Quests. I do not know the weekly rotation schedule though, so you’ll just want to check around.</p>
      <p>Alright, there’s your guide. Please don’t pay anyone to get this. Thanks.</p>
