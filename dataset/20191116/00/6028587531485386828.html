      <p><i>[Note - this article has been modified to rephrase the first question below.]</i>I recently sat down with entertainment mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg whose latest venture is mobile-first, millennial-focused video subscription service <a href="https://www.quibi.com/">Quibi</a>. Much is written about Quibi and its bold, brash $1+ billion experiment that takes Hollywood talent, production and budgets to the mobile screen for the first time. And Katzenberg certainly faces skeptics (I recently wrote a piece for <i>Forbes </i>titled<i> </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercsathy/2019/08/12/the-case-for-and-against-katzenbergs-quibi/#618c4bb64809"><i>The Case For And Against Katzenberg’s Quibi</i></a>). Katzenberg himself has <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2019/jeffrey-katzenberg-meg-whitman-discuss-the-next-form-of-storytelling-at-sxsw-2019-video/">publicly stated</a> that Quibi’s success <i>“falls somewhere between the improbable and impossible.” </i>So, why would Katzenberg go “there” and stake his reputation on his latest and perhaps most audacious big bet?</p>
      <p>Short answer, Katzenberg is a fearless media-tech disruptor who can’t slow down. And it’s that kind of fearlessness that drives any kind of entrepreneurial disruption and innovation forward (and the entertainment business is no exception). He may succeed with Quibi. He may not. But know this. All major studios have signed on for the ride. All invested big in Quibi, because they know that if Katzenberg can’t succeed with his game-changing mobile-first vision for premium Hollywood quality entertainment, then probably no one can.</p>
      <p>In this first of two parts to my interview, Katzenberg talks about Quibi and its skeptics. He also discusses Netflix, its business model, and how it compares to Quibi’s. In part two, which will be posted next Saturday, November 23rd, Katzenberg gets more personal. What motivates him. Whom he admires. And why he always “swings for the fences.” <i>(Note: I have made some very minor edits to our Q&amp;A for the sake of clarity.)</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>I. KATZENBERG: ON QUIBI, NETFLIX &amp; HOW THEY DIFFER</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Let me ask you about Netflix because you have mentioned that you expect Netflix to be a long-term media winner. Netflix recently announced that it would add an additional $2 billion in debt to its existing $12+ billion debt burden. So when you look at Netflix’s subscription-only business model, which is very much unlike Apple’s and Amazon’s that use content to drive underlying core hardware sales or Prime memberships, what do you think about Netflix’s prospects for long-term profitability and what it means for Quibi?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>JK: </b>I would say it’s working great for them [Netflix], but that’s not the path that Meg and I have chosen for Quibi. [Netflix] in its sort of fundamental design and architecture is to build the audience, and then we’ll figure out how to profitably monetize that over time. And again, I cannot argue with the success [it] is enjoying. Whatever you want to say, they [Netflix] have a $150 billion market cap. And both Reed [Hastings] and Ted [Sarandos] are phenomenal entrepreneurs and visionaries. That specific model that they have is not the model that Meg and I have pursued for Quibi. Maybe we’re old dogs. We are old school. We’ve grown up in a world where you actually have to make money. You have to have profits. In both of our cases, because we both have been public company CEOs, you actually had to do it reliably, repeatedly and predictably. So we bring that bias. And interestingly, that bias is actually about to become very popular again because that other path, at least very recently – in the last six, eight, ten weeks – has revealed itself to be very flawed and very problematic for a number of companies that have tried to go to the public markets for incremental investment. </p>
      <p>Our business model is literally built on a high margin, profitable business that is not dependent upon first gaining scale to figure out how to become profitable. We will be profitable along the way, and the business is designed literally within three years for us to actually be a cash flow positive business even at the scale of what we’re doing. Meg is bringing extraordinary experience and discipline and a history of running very very reliable, predictable, profitable businesses. That’s among her many superpowers. As the CEO of this company, she’s brought that discipline, because I’m the dreamer and she’s the practical one. Our plans for Quibi are built on accommodating both. So plan for the worst, and shoot for the best.</p>
      <p>
        <b>II. KATZENBERG: ON THE TRANSFORMING ENTERTAINMENT LANDSCAPE (&amp; WHO HE BELIEVES WILL WIN IN TODAY’S STREAMING WARS)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>When you’re looking at the worlds of media and entertainment, how do you believe those worlds will evolve in the next decade? What do you see happening?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>JK:</b> Well, I actually think it’s gonna happen in two to three years. I don’t think it’s going to take a decade. We are going to see consumer habits which have already shown very strong indications around this - that are going to coalesce into basically three consumption habits in three buckets. One of these has [already] revealed itself and has certainty around its path. The second is in the very midst of unprecedented transformation. And the other is nascent. So I look at a consumer and take an 18 to 44 year old, and I look at what their consumption is going to be around the bucket of their entertainment. We have a duopoly in music, and I think that duopoly is now actually going to strengthen and grow for Spotify and Apple Music. I think around media - movie, TV consumption, direct to consumer - [that bucket] is right in the middle of transformation. I think at the end of two to three years we are going to see less than a handful of players at scale. Other players will also have success, so scale is not the essential thing. It’s not that you’re either one of two or three players and if you’re half that, you will [not] also have a viable profitable successful business. It’s not a zero sum [game] where you either win or you lose. There will be players at different tiers.</p>
      <p>So, you look today and say Netflix, Disney+, Amazon right now are going to attain that [success at scale]. And then you have others who it’s too early to tell how they [will] fit in. But let’s be clear, HBO is the single most profitable traditional media platform on planet earth. Makes more money than all of them. Right now today they make $2 billion a year of profit, and they continue to make phenomenal content and put it out. What is HBO Max and how is that all [going to work out]? Too early to tell, but a lot of resources there. Comcast also has a phenomenal amount of content and entertainment and media assets, and they are very, very, very smart. Underestimate them at your peril is what I would say.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Well, Comcast just recently announced good quarterly earnings.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>JK:</b> They always do. </p>
      <p>
        <b>It’s the broadband. They’re losing content, but they’re driving more broadband.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>JK: </b>Again, Brian [Roberts] and Steve [Burke] <i>(of Comcast)</i> are formidable. Underestimate them at your peril would be my [advice], so you have them somewhere in there. Do you think Showtime goes away? I don’t think so. Do I think Starz goes away? I don’t think so. Everybody isn’t going to play in the same world. But that’s the world of certain traditional media, direct to consumer. The third [entertainment consumption habit], which is the nascent one, is where you’re sitting right here today, Quibi. So, I don’t think that anyone has imagined that however many subscriptions people have around their television consumption - however many of these two, three, four, five of them - no one today is thinking, well if you [have] them, you’re not going to subscribe to Apple Music or to Spotify. Completely different use cases. They’re not competitive. Quibi is going to become the third, because what we’re in play for has nothing to do with that. </p>
      <p>What we’re in play for is the existing world today of YouTube, Facebook Watch, Instagram, TikTok, video that is actually being consumed on the phone, on the go today, which is actually bigger than all the other stuff. All the others combined. It has already attained scale that is 2 billion monthly active users on YouTube. That’s more than all the others added together, right? They are in an ad-supported free world, so some small percentage of that universe of several billion people I think are going to migrate to super premium, high quality, Hollywood level production and storytelling on this [mobile] device, on the go, and I think that will be the third use case. And by the way, I don’t think we take share from those [others]. I think we continue to accelerate what is already meaningfully growing. </p>
      <p>
        <b>III. KATZENBERG: ON THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS TEN YEARS FROM NOW</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I do some reading of futurist Ray Kurzweil, and ten years out, and brain-computer interfaces and things like that, and how we’ve experienced the evolution of the screen for the last thirty years - but the basic interaction with the screen has not fundamentally changed during that period of time. Kurzweil and others talk about he concept of brain-computer interfaces where we each essentially become directly connected to the Cloud. What do you feel about that? What are your general thoughts about how realistic that is, whether that’s going to happen, and whether that’s a good or bad thing? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>JK:</b> I would say to you, I think about it. Not a ton, because I still think it’s over the horizon and around the corner. But you’re sitting across somebody who has spent most of his lifetime looking over the horizon around the corner. I believe that what Quibi is actually doing now, borrowing from one of the great scoring athletes of our time Wayne Gretzky, [is that] we’re skating to where the hockey puck is going, not where it is. And when you look at how this will continue to evolve, those [future interfaces] are things that are coming. I think that they’re a ways off, just like AR <i>(augmented reality)</i> and VR <i>(virtual reality)</i> have still not realized anywhere in the world of what they can and will be.</p>
      <p>I think we have a better chance of engaging in that [way] in an interactive device than on this <i>[points to his iPhone]</i> which is not interactive. That’s opportunity 2.0 for Quibi, which is how to actually now take advantage of the uniqueness, the interactivity of this [mobile] device. But where I thought you were going to go is [that] 14 years ago Steve Jobs invented this and designed this <i>[points to his iPhone again]</i>. He’s the greatest industrial designer of our lifetime, right? But it was never a TV set. People have forgotten that when he introduced this [iPhone], it was a telephone, it was a camera, it was for texting and for text across the Internet and for still pictures, right? And it was an iPod. It was for listening to music. It was never a TV set. So for the man who has literally designed every single solitary thing for the effectiveness of his goal and for the user experience, it was never a TV set. It wasn’t until six years later that Qualcomm invented a chip that allowed for streaming video mobile. Meanwhile the form was already designed. </p>
      <p>Now, interestingly, nobody actually has taken premium content and said, “how do you make that great on this [iPhone]?” Still not done to this day, because you’re either watching on a little box at the top, or if you turn it on its side it’s cut off on it, right? So, that’s where Meg Whitman and a team of people around here went. We’re going to turn this [iPhone] into a really good TV set, or video I should say, because TV is the wrong word. We’re going to turn this into an optimal way to watch video. And I’m going to get the entire Hollywood community onto it now with a new set of specs [to] make stuff that can be played beautifully on this. </p>
      <p>
        <b>And THAT’s Katzenberg’s great magic trick. Just like Steve Jobs before him revolutionized and beautifully transformed the mobile hardware that had come before it, Katzenberg hopes to revolutionize and beautifully transform the mobile content of today that will ride on top of mobile platforms (and, in so doing, transform our experiences that flow from that transformed mobile content).</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>But will Quibi’s economics work? It’s Katzenberg’s most challenging act to date. Yet, as he would say, bet against him at your own peril.</b>
