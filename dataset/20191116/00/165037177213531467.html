        <b>When the players of the Spanish national team came on to the pitch to face Malta, the stands at the Ramon de Carranza stadium welcomed Sergio Ramos with a tribute. The photograph above was taken previously and the Federation revealed the 'making of' it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He is loved by many and also hated by some, but <b>what is unquestionable is that he is vital for the Spanish national team, as well as Real Madrid, </b>where he has spent the most part of his career and where he has reaped almost <b>all of his triumphs.</b></p>
      <p>In the last game that Robert Moreno's team had to play, a tribute was <b>organized to his past and present. </b>The stands received him with<b> a big roar of applause and a big photo of him, </b>along with a mosaic. In this one the defender could be seen with several of his European titles.</p>
      <p>When the centre-back left the pitch after being substituted, a clear tactic from his coach so that he could receive a standing ovation, <b>the fans got up to thank him for his good work.</b> <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/sergio-ramos-23341/">The Sevillian</a> has his home very close to Cadiz and has already boasted a lot about Andalucia.</p>
      <p>But <b>all great things are made with time and effort </b>and the Federation wanted to bring to light how the image, that went around the stadium, was actually made.<b> He had to stand in front of the photographer</b> and do several different poses. </p>
