      <p>Remember when PlayStation TKO’d Xbox when the current-gen consoles were announced at E3 in 2013? That was the beginning of this generation’s “console war”. Now we’re in the early stages of what some are calling a “streaming war” between Microsoft’s XCloud and Google’s Stadia and history may be repeating itself. Only this time, it looks like Stadia is on the mat while Xbox roars.</p>
      <p>Xbox arrived at E3 in 2013 with a console loaded with features gamers didn’t want such as Kinect, the necessity of connecting online to play single-player games, and a host of restrictions on sharing games with friends. It also cost $100 more than Sony’s PS4. Sony took note and introduced the PS4 by highlighting everything unpopular about the Xbox One culminating with their hilarious video tutorial on how to share PS4 games. Xbox never fully recovered even though the Xbox One X, Game Pass and backward compatibility trifecta is far better than anything PlayStation has to offer other than its superior collection of exclusive games.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, Reddit hosted an AMA (Ask Me Anything) with Stadia where it was revealed that Google’s streaming service will launch on November 19 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/14/google-stadia-sure-is-launching-without-a-whole-lot-of-features-or-games/#6e95744a424d">without many of the features</a> that have been touted throughout the prelaunch hype. Here are some examples.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stadia’s major selling point was that high-quality content would be available seamlessly on desktops, laptops, tablets, phones and TVs but 4K HDR content will only be available on TVs at launch.</li>
        <li>Stadia uses Chromecast Ultra to communicate with a TV but it will only work with the Ultras that ship with the Founder’s Edition. The Chromecast Ultras that are out in the wild need a firmware update that Google hasn’t gotten around to rolling out yet.</li>
        <li>Family members won’t be able to share a game, everyone will have to buy their own version.</li>
        <li>Stadia will track game Achievements but the player can’t see them because the UI isn’t finished.</li>
        <li>The Founder’s Edition Buddy Passes that let you share Stadia with a friend aren’t available yet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There’s more, but you get the idea. All of this comes on top of the recent announcements that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/11/13/launch-titles-provide-a-good-test-of-whether-stadia-can-fulfill-its-promises/#4d2899d44985">Stadia is only launching with 12 games</a>, and with all the resources at its disposal, Google didn’t get it together to ship the Founder’s Edition packages so they would arrive on launch day. Units will be shipped in the order in which they were received with some scheduled to arrive weeks after launch. With Stadia’s disappointing start, many people who bought the $129 Founder’s Edition may be thinking they paid a lot of money to take part in what looks like a beta test.</p>

      <p>If there’s going to be a streaming war in the video game world, it’s going to be between Stadia and Xbox’s XCloud. Xbox revealed more information about XCloud, at its XO19 Live event in London the day after the Stadia AMA on Reddit. The contrast with Stadia couldn’t be more stark. For starters, Xbox calls its XCloud beta a “beta”. It’s been going on for a month and it’s free. You can learn about the beta and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-streaming/project-xcloud">sign up to get in line for an invite here</a>.</p>
      <p>Stadia is at a bit of a disadvantage when compared to XCloud because Stadia hasn’t launched yet. Nevertheless, Stadia tops XCloud because it will launch with 12 games while XCloud launched with only four. Stadia promises an unknown number of additional games before the end of the year but 50 games were just added to XCloud. Advantage XCloud. With the exception of <i>Destiny 2</i> which is free for those who bought the Founder’s Edition, Stadia games have to be purchased from Google. The 50+ games streaming during the XCloud beta are all free. Advantage XCloud.</p>

      <p>Stadia’s announced plans for the rest of 2019 and 2020 are generally about adding the features that are missing at launch. XCloud’s roadmap for 2020 includes adding the service to Game Pass. Unless Xbox adds restrictions, more than 100 games including Xbox exclusives available on the day they launch will be able to be streamed for the price of a Game Pass subscription. Advantage XCloud.</p>
      <p>Both Stadia and XCloud will let you play a game on one device and then pick it up right where you left off on another. XCloud will offer this ability for games you already own, Stadia only lets you do it with games you buy from Google. Advantage XCloud.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965239/xbox-project-scarlett-price-performance-ps5-phil-spencer-interview">The Verge</a>, Executive VP of Gaming at Microsoft Phil Spencer said “I would say a learning from the Xbox One generation is we will not be out of position on power or price.” It seems price and power aren’t the only things Xbox learned from this console generation. The XCloud announcements at XO19 aren’t as dramatic and don’t seem to be as clearly targeted at Stadia as PlayStation’s assault on Xbox was at E3 but the end result feels familiar. The Stadia launch is disappointing and XCloud looks exciting. Time will tell if history is about to repeat itself.</p>
