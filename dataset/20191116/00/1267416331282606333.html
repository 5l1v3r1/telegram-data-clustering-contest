      <h1>Google is renaming the Assistant tab in Photos to ‘For you’</h1>
      <h2>The new tab will have more of the creative Photos app suggestions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:09:25+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 00:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>Google is renaming the Assistant tab within the Photos app to ‘For you,’ according to <i><a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/14/google-photos-for-you/">9to5Google</a>. </i></p>
      <p>Google’s Photos app includes several Assistant-enabled features. For example, it can create collages, stylize photos and even make small clips with pictures.</p>
      <p>This feature was previously in the Assistant tab but Google is now renaming it to ‘For you.’ <i>9to5 </i>says that Google is likely looking to reduce confusion. Other suggestions will be moved to a new ‘Manage your library’ feed that’s accessible in the app’s menu.</p>
      <p>Google is moving suggestions like “fixing sideways photos and archiving receipts” to this section as well.</p>
      <p>For me, Manage your Library indicated that I needed to clear some of my blurry images and screenshots.</p>
      <p>It seems like the cool, more interesting editing features shift to ‘For you,’ while the more basic functionality is now part of  ‘Manage your library.’</p>
      <p>The update is available for Photos on iOS today, but has not made its way to all Android users. It is available on desktop, however.</p>
      <p>With iOS I can see ‘Manage your library’ but not ‘For you.’ It’s possible it only populates when Photos has suggestions for your recently taken pictures, though it’s currently unclear.</p>
