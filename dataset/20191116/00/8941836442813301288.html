      <p>PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. (AP) - Players and spectators ran for cover Friday night when a gunman opened fire at a New Jersey high school <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/football/">football</a> game, wounding two people.</p>
      <p>One of the wounded was a young boy, who was airlifted to a children’s hospital in Philadelphia “with some serious injuries,” Atlantic County Prosecutor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/damon-tyner/">Damon Tyner</a> said.</p>
      <p>Panicked spectators and some of the players knocked down a fence in their haste to escape the confines of the field.</p>

      <p>“It was mayhem, literally people coming in waves running away” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jonathan-diego/">Jonathan Diego</a>, who played for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pleasantville/">Pleasantville</a> team in 1984. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jonathan-diego/">Diego</a> helped coach a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pleasantville/">Pleasantville</a> youth <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/football/">football</a> team involved in a game against an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a> team in which three spectators were shot and wounded in 2005. All three survived.</p>
      <p>That same Jokers team was practicing in 2015 when a spectator was shot, but survived.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately, around here it’s not as uncommon as it sounds,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jonathan-diego/">Diego</a> said.</p>
      <p>He described a panicked scene as some children were separated from their parents, and other parents held babies and young children tight to keep them from being run over by fleeing spectators.</p>
      <p>The shooting happened about 8:30 p.m. during the third quarter of a playoff game between the Camden Panthers and the Pleasantville Greyhounds, said Pleasantville Police Chief Sean Riggins.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/damon-tyner/">Tyner</a>, the prosecutor, told The Associated Press the shooting took place on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pleasantville/">Pleasantville</a> side of the bleachers. No one had been arrested as of late Friday, and authorities were investigating whether more than one shooter might have been involved.</p>

        <p>Authorities did not identify shooting victims nor release information on their conditions other than to say both were alive several hours after the shooting.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jonathan-diego/">Diego</a> said his friend, a retired paramedic, gave first aid to a young boy who had suffered a gunshot wound to the neck.</p>
        <p>“He applied pressure to the little boy’s wounds on his neck, trying to slow down the bleeding until the ambulance could come up,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jonathan-diego/">Diego</a> said.</p>
        <p>The boy was flown by helicopter to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The adult shooting victim was taken to AtlanticCare Regional Medical Center in nearby <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a>.</p>
        <p>A statement from the Camden City School District said no Camden High School students “were injured or otherwise harmed.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pleasantville/">Pleasantville</a> is about seven miles (11 kilometers) west of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a>. Its high school team won its first division title in 43 years this season, and the stands were packed.</p>
        <p>Videos posted to Twitter show people hitting the ground, running from the bleachers and jumping over chain-link fences as the gunfire erupted. At least six gunshots are audible in a video posted by Jersey Sports Zone, which also shows players stop mid-play, look at the stands and then turn and run.</p>
        <p>“I heard the gunshots,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pleasantville/">Pleasantville</a> football player Ernest Howard, 17, said in a Twitter clip posted by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter. “We started all running for this fence and tried to run inside the gym.”</p>
        <p>In a press conference, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/damon-tyner/">Tyner</a> referenced a Thursday shooting at a Southern California high school, where a 16-year-old boy killed two students and wounded three others. The shooter died Friday.</p>
        <p>“This is a tragic situation, to say the least, on the heels of what just happened in Santa Clarita, California,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/damon-tyner/">Tyner</a> said. “It has hit home here in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pleasantville/">Pleasantville</a>, New Jersey, and it is very disturbing, to say the least.”</p>

        <p>This story has been corrected to report the name of the 17-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/football/">football</a> player quoted is Ernest Howard, not Ernest Holland; that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pleasantville/">Pleasantville</a> is west of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlantic-city/">Atlantic City</a>, not southeast and that a witness’ first name is spelled <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jonathan-diego/">Jonathan</a>, not Johnathan.</p>
