        <b>La Liga President, Javier Tebas, has been reviewed, together with other Presidents such as Enrique Cerezo and Quico Catalan. The La Liga director made it clear that he doesn't want any trouble.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>"La Liga's DNA is financial control</b>. Without it, there would be more investment, but also more debt. The second debt was the real right of sales, focused on club's rughts, which has given the ability to maintain talent and sign players," said Tebas at the 'Marca Sport Weekend' in Marbella.</p>
      <p>About the dispute that he is in the middle of with Luis Rubiales and the RFEF, Tebas commented: <b>"I am not looking for trouble</b>. I'd love to be in the national team game. I don't like trouble or riots, although Enrique Cerezo laughs. I like to get along well with people. With Villar we are only facing each other because of the Royal Decree of the clubs. In La Liga we manage and we have to do well and our obligation is to defend our rights and<b> today the RFEF is attacking the rights of clubs".</b></p>

      <p>Atletico President, Enrique Cerezo, praised La Liga's work and the evolution of his club: "The margin of growth at Atletico Madrid<b> has no limits</b>. We were in a difficult situation. Above all due to the centralisation of television rights,<b> this has been one of the great achievements</b> we have among the clubs and it is bearing very good fruit. We've made a big change and we were all sorry to leave Calderon, but now we have great results".</p>
      <p>Quico Catalán, meanwhile, made it clear that growth must be general and between all clubs together: "For Levante, the fact that<b> Cristiano is in Juventus is bad news and that Messi continues in Barcelona is good news.</b> I want to get closer to the figures that the big ones charge, but having made it clear that we have to grow together. That's why we have a position so contrary to the European Super League".</p>
