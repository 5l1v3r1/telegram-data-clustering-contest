      <p>MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) - Senior quarterback Dalton Sneed threw three touchdowns passes, all to Samori Toure, to lead Montana over Weber State 35-16 Saturday.</p>
      <p>Toure, a junior, had a career-high 193 receiving yards as the Grizzlies (9-2, 6-1 in the Big Sky Conference) handled the showdown between two top teams in the Football Championship Subdivision.</p>
      <p>Toure’s first touchdown, covering 10 yards, gave Montana the lead for good at 7-0 at 11:24 of the first quarter. The Grizzlies, ranked No. 5 in the STATS/FCS poll, scored four plays after partially blocking a punt.</p>
