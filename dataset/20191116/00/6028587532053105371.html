      <p>American Express is combining two of its most popular cardholder benefits this month when it opens a <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/campaigns/platinum-house/">Platinum House</a> experience over the weekend of November 30 – December 1, the same weekend its <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/shop-small/">Small Business Saturday</a> promotion takes place. Small Business Saturday was launched in 2010 as a way of encouraging consumers to patronize small, local businesses on the busy holiday-shopping weekend after Thanksgiving. American Express cardholders are usually eligible for discounts or rebates at participating businesses. This year marks its tenth anniversary, so American Express decided to launch a Platinum House installation the same weekend.</p>

      <p>Platinum House is a series of exclusive pop-up lounges open to members with The Platinum Card from American Express and Centurion cardholders. They take place at upscale cultural events that tend to be of interest to Amex cardholders. Past iterations have ranged from special boxes at the U.S. Open to events Art Basel and the Aspen Food and Wine Festival, as well as lounges at the Coachella music festival where concertgoers could retreat to beat the heat.</p>
      <p>November’s Platinum House will mark the first one ever to take place in New York City, and will be located at 5 East 17<sup>th</sup> Street. The hours will be from noon until 5:00pm both days. Platinum and Centurion members can enter with up to three guests depending on the space available.</p>
      <p>Attendees will be treated to a variety of treats. There will be food and snacks from Amex’s Global Dining Collection partners, including the world’s only Michelin-starred Korean Steakhouse, Cote, coastal Italian fare from Legacy Records, and contemporary Indonesian cuisine from Wayan by Cedric Vongerichten.</p>

The event will also feature a specialty cocktail from Under Cote using a beverage made of locally grown Gotham Greens created by Viraj Puri. There will be Amex concierges on hand to help with holiday shopping, restaurant reservations and other planning needs, plus a custom gift-wrapping service (up to two gifts per person) curated by Sarah Andelman, the founder and former creative director of Colette. Take-home local shopping guides will be available to folks looking for inside picks of the area’s best retail secrets.</p>
      <p>Visitors will also be able to take home a signed copy of former <i>Teen Vogue </i>editor-in-chief Elaine Welteroth’s book, <i>More Than Enough</i>. Welteroth will be on hand for a meet-and-greet at some point. Amex has also said there will be a few holiday surprises in store, though no other details have yet been released.</p>
      <p>Depending on your plans that weekend, being able to stop by the American Express Platinum House might be just the break you need from a busy shopping spree fighting off the hordes of other bargain hunters.</p>
