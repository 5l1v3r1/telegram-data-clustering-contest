      <h4>Donald Trump has pardoned two Army officers accused of war crimes, one of whom was still set to stand trial. The US president also restored the rank of a Navy SEAL convicted of posing with a dead "Islamic State" captive.</h4>
      <p>United States President Donald Trump has pardoned two US Army officers accused of war crimes and restored the rank of a Navy SEAL platoon commander who was demoted for actions in Iraq, the White House said in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration said the US president, who also holds the title of Commander in Chief, granted full pardons to First Lieutenant Clint Lorance and Major Mathew Golsteyn. Trump also ordered the promotion of decorated Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who was convicted of posing with a dead captive from the "Islamic State" (IS) militant group in 2017.</p>
      <p>"For more than 200 years, presidents have used their authority to offer second chances to deserving individuals, including those in uniform who have served our country," White House press secretary Stephanie Graham said in a written statement. "These actions are in keeping with this long history."</p>

      <p>
        <b>Preemptive pardon</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lorance was convicted of murder for illegally ordering the fatal shootings of two unarmed Afghan men in July 2012. He has served more than six years of his 19-year sentence. </p>
      <p>Trump's pardon of Golsteyn, a former Green Beret, came before he was set to stand trial by court-martial, accused of killing a suspected bomb-maker in 2010 while deployed in Afghanistan. His trial had been scheduled for December but was postponed until February 19 to give attorneys more time to prepare.</p>
      <p>In a statement Friday, Golsteyn said his family is "profoundly grateful" for Trump's pardon.</p>
      <p>"We have lived in constant fear of this runaway prosecution. Thanks to President Trump, we now have a chance to rebuild our family and lives. With time, I hope to regain my immense pride in having served our military," he said in the statement. </p>
      <p>Golsteyn's defense attorney, Philip Stackhouse, said he was "confident we would have prevailed in the trial, but this action by the President expedited justice in this case."</p>

          <figcaption>Donald Trump on NATO: Top quotes<br/><b>Trump on NATO: A war of words<br/></b>Even before taking office, US President Donald Trump's relationship with NATO has been a tumultuous one, to say the least. He has disparaged the trans-Atlantic alliance, once describing it as "obsolete" and a relic of the Cold War. Here are Trump's most memorable quotes about the military alliance, even if they are at times false.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Donald Trump on NATO: Top quotes<br/><b>'Days of the Soviet Union'<br/></b>While on the campaign trail in 2016, Trump made clear that he saw NATO as a relic of the Cold War. "You know, we're dealing with NATO from the days of the Soviet Union, which no longer exists. We need to either transition into terror or we need something else." But his remarks didn't account for how the alliance backed the US well after the collapse of the Soviet Union, especially in Afghanistan.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Donald Trump on NATO: Top quotes<br/><b>'Germany owes vast sums'<br/></b>Trump has made defense spending his main talking point on NATO. But he has falsely accused member states of owing money to Washington, saying: "Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO, and the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany." The problem is NATO doesn't work like that. No money is owed to the alliance for defense or otherwise.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Donald Trump on NATO: Top quotes<br/><b>'Obsolete'<br/></b>Days before his inauguration, Trump caught NATO members off guard when he claimed the alliance was "obsolete" and threatened to withdraw support. "I said a long time ago that NATO had problems: Number one, it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago." Months later, he retracted his statement, citing changes within the alliance. "Now they fight terrorism," he said.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Donald Trump on NATO: Top quotes<br/><b>'Doesn't sound very smart'<br/></b>Trump had tended to lump trade between US allies with how much Washington spends on defense. "We are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion (in trade losses). That doesn't sound very smart to me," Trump said. The problem is that while NATO members have agreed to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense, the alliance has nothing to do with international trade.</figcaption>

Trump was referring to Russia as Europe's primary source for oil and natural gas, but he created a false dichotomy between energy reliance and NATO's defense spending goal.</figcaption>

The president said he'd asked himself the same question, appearing undermine the military alliance's collective defense clause. Trump went on to describe Montenegrins as a "very strong" and "very aggressive," and that that aggression risked starting World War III.<br/>Author: Lewis Sanders IV</figcaption>

      <p>Gallagher, a decorated SEAL platoon leader, was accused of committing various war crimes while stationed in Iraq. In July, a military jury acquitted him of murdering an IS captive by stabbing the prisoner in the neck. However, Gallagher, who was in line for promotion, was convicted of illegally posing with the captive's corpse and was demoted from the rank of chief petty officer to first-class petty officer.</p>
      <p>Timothy Parlatore, one of Gallagher's attorneys, said after the ruling that Gallagher's conviction cost him up to $200,000 (€181,000) in retirement funds because of his loss of rank.</p>
      <p>On his Instagram page, Gallagher expressed his appreciation for Trump ordering the promotion, saying he believes "that we are blessed as a nation to have a Commander in Chief that stands up for our warfighters, and cares about how they and their families are treated."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Utterly shameful'</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Pentagon spokesperson said the US Department of Defense has confidence in the military justice system, saying that the president "has the authority to weigh in on matters of this nature."</p>
      <p>US Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters last week that he had a "robust discussion" with Trump over the cases. He declined to provide any details but said, "I do have full confidence in the military justice system and we'll let things play out as they play out."</p>
      <p>The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the president's decision, saying the actions were an "utterly shameful use of presidential powers."</p>
      <p>"Trump has sent a clear message of disrespect for law, morality, the military justice system, and those in the military who abide by the laws of war," Hina Shamsi, the director of the ACLU's National Security Project, said in a statement.</p>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>Canines popular service-force animals<br/></b>Many different animals are used for highly specialized tasks. Dogs are often used by law enforcement and customs officers, and they're also deployed to detect drugs, explosives, and even data carriers. US General McKenzie has said military dogs "help protect US troops, save the lives of civilians, keep combatants and non-combatants apart, and immobilize hostile individuals."</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>Eagle versus drone<br/></b>Security agencies also enlist the help of other animals, however. Dutch police, for example, use eagles to fight enemy drones. Should drones get too close to nuclear power plants or such key sites, the birds can bring them down. Dutch authorities train the eagles to treat drones as potentially pray. But there are other heroic birds, too — like canaries ...</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>Tragic heroes<br/></b>So, what special ability can canaries offer? Can they hunt down terrorists, sniff out explosives, or bring down dangerous drones? None of the above. But they have been deployed along the border between North and South Korea to detect poisonous gas.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>Little yellow helpers<br/></b>South Korea was concerned North Korea could attack it with toxic gas, so it set up cages with canaries along the border. If the birds would fall of their perch and die, South Koreans would know it was time to don the gas masks. Why? Because canaries are so small that they are much more susceptible to tiny amounts of gas.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>First ever animal in space<br/></b>Laika, a small Russian dog, was the first ever animal to be launched into space. It happened on November 3, 1957, and was intended to show off the Soviet Union's spaceflight prowess. Laika, however, paid with her life. It is believed she died from stress and overheating. She was not the first animal with such a special mission, however.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>Spy pigeons<br/></b>Pigeons used to be deployed to send messages, which were written on pieces of paper that they carried. In World War I, they were also used to take photographs of enemy positions. Unfortunately, the cameras used at the time could only take one or two photographs. Later, they were reportedly able to snap up to 12.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>Mine-sniffing rats<br/></b>Like dogs, rats also have a keen sense of smell, and because they are so much lighter, they are used in some parts of the world to detect land mines; there is a much lower risk that they might accidentally set off an unexploded land mine. But what do you do about naval mines? What kind of animals can hep detect them?</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The real navy seals: Animals in action<br/><b>Dolphins with fins that film<br/></b>There is an animal that is perfect for finding underwater mines: the dolphin. This one answers to the name K-Dog and shows off a camera mounted on its pectoral fin. It is employed by the US Navy. During the Cold War, both the US and the Soviet Union used dolphins in their naval marine mammal programs. Russia claims it has phased out the program; the US has not.</figcaption>

Beyond mines, seals and dolphins can also detect divers and protect ships and ports. It has been rumored that dolphins can also be used for attacks, for instance, by attaching mines to enemy vessels.</figcaption>

Horses have been used for military and policing purposes for millennia. In the Middle Ages they carried knights; today they carry police officers — as above, working security at a soccer match in London. What makes them such good animals for the force? Well, they work like a horse, of course. <br/>Author: Marco Müller</figcaption>
