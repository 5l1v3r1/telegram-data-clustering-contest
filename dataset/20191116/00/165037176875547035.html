        <b>Tite discussed his exchange with Lionel Messi in Friday's 1-0 loss to Argentina.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Brazil </b>head coach <b>Tite </b>said he was told to shut up by <b>Argentina</b> captain <b>Lionel Messi</b> in the friendly clash between the South American rivals.</p>
      <p><b>Messi </b>returned from a three-month international ban to lead <b>Argentina</b> past <b>Brazil</b> 1-0 thanks to his <b>13th-minute goal</b> in Riyadh on Friday.</p>
      <p>Argentina star <b>Messi </b>missed Argentina's previous four matches due to a suspension for accusing CONMEBOL of favouring hosts <b>Brazil </b>– who won their semi-final meeting – at the <b>Copa America</b> and he was in the thick of the action against Tite's Selecao.</p>

      <p><b>Messi and Tite exchanged words</b> in the opening half, with the Barcelona superstar seen putting his fingers to his lips as the <b>Brazil </b>boss complained to the referee.</p>
      <p>"I complained because he [Messi] should have been shown a <b>yellow card</b> and he told me to shut my mouth and I told him to shut his mouth," <b>Tite </b>said. "And that was it."</p>
      <p>Tite added: "<b>I don't want to answer</b> anymore on it. You need a strong referee because he'll swallow you… It should have been a card,<b> I was right to complain</b>."</p>
      <p>Messi's goal condemned <b>Brazil </b>– who have struggled since lifting the <b>Copa America</b> trophy – to their fifth consecutive match without victory.</p>
