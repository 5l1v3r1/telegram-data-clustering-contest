      <p>Seoul - <b>Daewoo Shipbuilding </b>&amp; Marine Engineering Co., a major South Korean shipbuilder, reported a third-quarter net loss of 296.4 billion won (230 million euros) due to one-off costs, writes South Korea’s news agency Yonhap.</p>
      <p>Daewoo Shipbuilding’s <b>net losses for the three months </b>ending Sept. 30 narrowed from 323.9 billion won deficit a year ago, but the result is still a disappointing turnaround from the two previous quarters when the company stayed in the black.</p>
      <p>The shipbuilder also posted an <b>operating loss of 256.3 billion won in the July-September period</b>, marking its first loss in seven quarters. Sales dipped 11.4 percent on-year to 1.94 trillion won. Daewoo Shipbuilding blamed its poor performance on one-off costs related to a drill ship order cancellation and increased fixed costs. Daewoo Shipbuilding has so far won orders for 26 vessels worth $5.35 billion this year, achieving 64 percent of its annual target of $8.37 billion.</p>
