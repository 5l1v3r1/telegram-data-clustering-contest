      <h1>Almost an hour of the greyer Bale in Azerbaijan</h1>

        <b>Gareth Bale played again. With his national team, of course. He started in Wales' match against Azerbaijan in the qualification phase for Euro 2020, a key match for his country's aspirations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bale, who hasn't played for Real Madrid since 5th October, played for an hour as Wales beat Azerbaijan in Baku.</p>
      <p><b>He is Wales' star player</b>. There is little doubt about that. Real Madrid's number 11 has got his teammates used to his name appearing on the goalscorer/assist list.</p>
      <p>In addition, all dangerous passages of play usually happen, sooner or later, because of him. Even in Madrid, <b>his contribution was always striking</b> ... in the games he could play. But this did not happen in Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Bale was greyer than expected. No one will overlook hisÂ lack of rhythm and competition, but Azerbaijan's level did not require a great version of himself to excel in the match.</p>
      <p>Playing on the right, Wales once looked for him, but beyond a good pass to the box that Wilson eventually fired straight into the keeper's hands hardly had any impact on the match.</p>

      <p>Moore and Wilson in the centre, these were the scorers in the match, in plays in which Gareth hardly participated.</p>
      <p>The protagonism that Bale could have in the first half was<b> because of the domination of his team than for his interventions</b>. And as this did not happen in the second half, his 14 minutes of the second half were even less transcendental.</p>
      <p><b>In the 59th minute, Giggs decided to take him off</b>, aware of his lack of minutes and, above all, because of what is at stake against Hungary on Tuesday: nothing more and nothing less than a ticket to the Euros. And there, they will need more of their star.</p>
      <p>Bale was included in the starting XI despite not playing for Real Madrid since he got injured, 10th October, in his country's match against Croatia.</p>
      <p>On his return to Madrid, Bale was sidelined from Zinedine Zidane's squad and focused on recovering from his recent injury, just in time to answer Giggs' call and take part in his national team's <b>decisive qualifying matches</b>.</p>
      <p>42 days after his last game with Real Madrid, 37 since he played for the national team, Bale returned to the pitch.</p>
