        <b>McLaren Formula 1 driver Carlos Sainz will start from the back of the grid in Brazil after an ignition wiring issue during qualifying caused a loss of power.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz slowed to a crawl and retreated to the pits during the opening stages of Q1, and was classified last during the session having been unable to set a lap time.</p>
      <p>Renault traced the source of the problem after the session, but no decision has been taken on whether the Spaniard will take any new components.</p>
      <p>He has a high-mileage "Friday" engine that was used on Friday, but as he starts at the back of the grid there would be no extra penalty if he takes a new power unit.</p>
      <p>The team also has the option to make changes to the specification of the car - such as taking out drag to make it easier to overtake - which would lead to a pitlane start.</p>
      <p>"It's still open at the moment," said McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl. "We still need to figure out what we want to do, what were the consequences.</p>
      <p>"And we also have a first analysis now, which means that the wiring system of the of the ignition failed and that was causing a power loss Carlos felt and nothing we could fix."</p>

      <p>Sainz admitted that managing his tyres would be the biggest issue as he tries to make progress through the field.</p>
      <p>"It's maximum attack I guess," he said.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, maximum attack doesn't always work with Pirelli tyres. So it will be a compromise between managing the tyres and going maximum attack. So it's probably a very difficult thing to do, but somehow you must always find a way."</p>
      <p>Sainz's team-mate Lando Norris could manage only 11th place after a clean qualifying session, indicating a drop-off in McLaren's form compared to recent races.</p>
      <p>"I guess we've seen some trends this year in some tracks that there are certain types of corners where we are not very strong," explained Sainz.</p>
      <p>"And probably this track has many of those types of corners.</p>
      <p>"That's why your relative performance drops depending on track to track, but also it doesn't mean that we cannot make it to the points.</p>
      <p>"It just means that it's going to be probably a lot tougher, or tougher than Austria, for example, where it was a good one.</p>
      <p>"But it doesn't mean that we cannot do it. It just means that we need to do better."</p>
