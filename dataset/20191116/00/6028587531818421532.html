      <h1>Apple Loop: Three New iPhone Leaks, Apple Beaten By Spotify, Facebook's iPhone Camera Bug</h1>

      <p>Taking a look back at another week of news and headlines from Cupertino, this week’s Apple Loop includes three key iPhone 12 features, the launch of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, details of the new screen and scissor keyboard on the MacBook Pro, the potential impact on the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac Pro launch dates, Facebook’s iOS bug explained, Phil Schiller fights the Chromebook, and Spotify beats Apple.Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/11/15/android-google-news-headline-samsung-galaxy-s11-sony-xperia3-leak-rumor-mi-note10-review-moto-razr/">and you can read my weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes</a>).</p>

        <b>The Key To Selling The iPhone 12</b>
      </p>
      <p>As more details on the iPhone 12 come out, it’s clear that Apple is regarding the 2020 smartphone as a significant step forward in technology and design, compared to the iterative updates to the iPhone 11 family. There are a number of key features that will help sell the iOS-powered phone. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/11/11/apple-iphone-12-details-new-leak-rumor-screen-design-5g-specs-launch-date/">I took a closer look at them earlier this week</a>, starting with 5G:</p>
      <blockquote>Although the availability of 5G is growing, it is not [currently] in demand by the average consumer. That the top of the line iPhone 11 Pro Max does not support 5G (in the way that say the Galaxy S10 family and the OnePlus 7 family both have 5G variants) is not a huge loss to consumers today.<br/>But the expectation for 2020 is that most premium handset families will all be sporting 5G. Samsung will likely be the first out of the gate ahead of MWC Barcelona in February, and the competition will follow. Seven months later, Apple will launch the iPhone 12 handsets and the current information is that they will all sport 5G options.</blockquote>

        <b>The 16-Inch MacBook Pro Is Finally Announced</b>
      </p>
      <p>The big news from Apple this week is the launch of the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Rather than hand the MacOS laptop a significant launch event, Apple invited a hand-picked group of journalists and community members to their offices to experience the new laptop. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962380/apples-16-inch-macbook-pro-keyboard-screen-speakers-processor">Dieter Bohn looks at the hardware, including the most significant change</a>… the Magic Keyboard:</p>
      <blockquote>Reader, it is good.<br/>I shouldn’t be that definitive in this hands-on with the laptop since I’ve only been typing on it for half a day, but I don’t expect my opinion to change with more time. Apple has dropped the butterfly mechanism it has used on MacBooks for the past few years and gone back to good old reliable scissor switches. Apple has enough faith in this new (old) design that it won’t be including this MacBook Pro in its extended keyboard repair program.</blockquote>

As well as the obvious change to the display (by shrinking the bezels a 16-inch screen fits in the same space as the older 15-inch screen), developers and power users will be able to welcome back the Escape Key. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2019/11/13/apple-suddenly-launches-macbook-pro-16in-display-magic-keyboard-heres-all-you-need-to-know/">Forbes’ David Phelan</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Some users didn’t like that the Escape key was part of the Touch Bar. It didn’t trouble me but it’s cool to have it back and there’s something especially reassuring that if there’s a problem with the Touch Bar, you have a more traditional key to get you out of trouble.</blockquote>

        <b>Taking The Ive Out Of The MacBook Pro</b>
      </p>
      <p>Daring Fireball’s John Gruber has taken a look not just at the MacBook Pro’s hardware, but its place in the whole ecosystem. He also notes that many of the changes are less about pushing forward a new ideal, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/16-inch_macbook_pro_first_impressions">correcting mistakes that have crept into the laptop line-up over the last few years</a>. Is the balance between form and function moving back towards functionality?</p>
      <blockquote>It’s hard not to speculate that all of these changes are, to some degree, a de-Jony-Ive-ification of the keyboard. For all we on the outside know, this exact same keyboard might have shipped today even if Jony Ive were still at Apple.2 I’m not sure I know anyone, though, who would disagree that over the last 5-6 years, Apple’s balance of how things work versus how things look has veered problematically toward making things look better — hardware and software — at the expense of how they function.</blockquote>

        <b>The 16-Inch MacBook Has Caused A Problem</b>
      </p>
      <p>The redesigned keyboard, larger screen, and the reintroduction of the escape key, are all attractive and welcome. But there’s an embarrassing question to be asked of Apple. Given the new features on the 16-inch MacBook Pro are expected to be available on the smaller laptops in early 2020, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/11/14/apple-macbook-pro-16inch-new-problems-screen-keyboard-design-flaws/">Why would anyone purchase a 13-inch MacBook Pro this holiday season</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Both of these technologies can be easily fitted into the 13-inch MacBook Pro chassis, and many of the geekerati are expecting Apple to do just that, although with the product release cycle its unlikely to happen before the end of 2019. I personally feel that the March event for the expected launch of the iPhone SE 2 would be the best estimate - that gives time for the Christmas retail chain to be cleared of the old inventory before the launch of the new product.<br/>It also means that the smart decision for those looking at the smaller MacBook Pro should hold off a few months, get through the festive season, and pick up a MacOS laptop that replaces the hobbled keyboard and smaller screen on the current 13-inch MacBook Pro.</blockquote>

        <b>Here Comes The Mac Pro</b>
      </p>
      <p>Along with the MacBook Pro release, Apple has also confirmed the details of the Mac Pro. Announced over the summer at WWDC 2019, the desktop powerhouse will roll out in December. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-mac-pro-to-ship-in-december/">Tim Hardwick has more details</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The base model ‌Mac Pro‌ starts at $5,999 and features an 8-core 3.5GHz Intel Xeon processor, a Radeon Pro 580X GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. Additional technical specifications and configure-to-order options are available on Apple’s website.</blockquote>

        <b>Facebook Bug Exposed Camera To The Code</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the start of the week, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaMaddux">a bug was found in the Facebook app that saw the code actively use the camera</a>. Following the disclosure, a fix was quickly submitted to the app store by Facebook to close the loophole. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/facebook-ios-camera-bug-fix/">Chance Miller reports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>…we speculated that this problem was likely the result of negligence rather than malice. While specifics of the situation and how the issue came to be are still unclear, Facebook has at least been timely in rolling out a fix. With that being said, iOS could do more with something like a “camera in use” indicator.</blockquote>

        <b>Phil Schiller’s iPad vs Chromebook Debate</b>
      </p>
      <p>Is the iPad a more educational device than a Chromebook? <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/">Apple’s Phil Schiller talked about this subject CNet</a> while discussing the MacBook Pro launch:</p>
      <blockquote>“Kids who are really into learning and want to learn will have better success. It’s not hard to understand why kids aren’t engaged in a classroom without applying technology in a way that inspires them. You need to have these cutting-edge learning tools to help kids really achieve their best results.<br/>Yet Chromebooks don’t do that. Chromebooks have gotten to the classroom because, frankly, they’re cheap testing tools for required testing. If all you want to do is test kids, well, maybe a cheap notebook will do that. But they’re not going to succeed.”</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/">The full interview is at CNet</a>. Following its publication, <a href="https://twitter.com/pschiller/status/1194718614869250048">Schiller addressed the controversial comments on Twitter</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Every child has the ability to succeed — helping them to do that has always been our mission. In the full conversation with CNET, we discussed giving kids and teachers the content, curriculum and tools they need to learn, explore and grow. Not just to take a test.</blockquote>
      <p>This is a very nuanced debate, and one which brings in more realities than just the hardware itself. You have to consider budgets, curriculums, accessibility, and more. <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/apple/221999/apple-exec-disparages-schools-that-can-only-afford-chromebooks">Mehedi Hassan writes</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Schiller is essentially saying that schools who can’t afford to buy iPads are going to have less engaged kids, and thus, poorer results. That is obviously not the case and considering the fact that most schools can barely afford to purchase supplies for kids, it’s insensitive to for a senior Apple executive to make such a claim.</blockquote>

        <b>And Finally…</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Apple focuses on its endeavours with subscription TV services, the world of podcasting has been evolving while Apple’s podcast focus has not kept pace. Spotify has been making huge strides in the space, and the slower moving Apple has conceded the top spot in a number of territories. <a href="https://blog.voxnest.com/apple-vs-spotify-october-data/">That’s the conclusion of a report from Voxnest</a>. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/spotify-grows-podcasts-surpasses-apple-some-countries/">Filipe Espósito picks up the report details</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>According to a new report published today by Voxnest, Spotify has already become the most used application for listening to podcasts in some regions, taking Apple out of first place. The report mentions that Apple hasn’t announced any significant new features for its podcasts service in recent months, while Spotify has made big moves in that department.<br/>From March to October of this year, Spotify has become the most widely used podcast app in several European countries. One of the most notorious cases is that of Sweden, considered one of the countries with the most podcast listeners, with about 36% of Swedes included in the statistics. Previously, the platform had already become the most popular among users in almost all Latin American countries.</blockquote>
