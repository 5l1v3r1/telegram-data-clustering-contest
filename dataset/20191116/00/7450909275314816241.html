      <p><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Michael-Page-91937">Michael Page</a> has found a new opponent for the main event at <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/Bellator-London-MVP-vs-Anderson-81823">Bellator London</a> next week.<br/><br/>Italy's <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Giovanni-Melillo-195245">Giovanni Melillo</a> (13-4) has stepped up to replace <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Derek-Anderson-83421">Derek Anderson</a>, who pulled out of the contest <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Derek-Anderson-Withdraws-from-Bellator-London-Main-Event-vs-Michael-Page-165703">last week</a> due to an undisclosed injury. The two will come to blows at Bellator London, which will go down at the SSE Arena in London on Nov. 23.<br/><br/>For Melillo, this will be his first foray under the <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Bellator-MMA-1960">Bellator MMA</a> banner. He is coming off a unanimous decision victory over one-time <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> competitor <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Will-Chope-69087">Will Chope</a>. Melillo's biggest win in his career to date is his highlight-reel KO over <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Mohsen-Bahari-61152">Mohsen Bahari</a> at Cage Warriors 83 in 2017. In addition to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Cage-Warriors-Fighting-Championship-186">Cage Warriors Fighting Championship</a>, Melillo has fought for several premier European organizations including <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Venator-Fighting-Championship-9601">Venator Fighting Championship</a>, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Superior-Fighting-Championship-3432">Superior FC</a> and <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Absolute-Championship-Akhmat-8185">Absolute Championship Akhmat</a>.<br/><br/>In his last fight, "Venom" (15-1) finished <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Richard-Kiely-220567">Richard Kiely</a> in the opening stanza of their Bellator 227 encounter. Prior to that, "MVP" tasted defeat for the first time in his career when <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Douglas-Lima-17236">Douglas Lima</a> knocked him out 35 seconds into Round 2 at Bellator 221. Before the loss, he was on a 14-bout winning streak.<br/><br/>On the same bill, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Chris-Bungard-73304">Chris Bungard</a> will now face Bellator newcomer <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Benjamin-Brander-112251">Benjamin Brander</a> after <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Mario-Saeed-79949">Mario Saeed</a> was forced to pull out of the fight.</p>
