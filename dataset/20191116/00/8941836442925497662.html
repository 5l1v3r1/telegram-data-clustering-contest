      <h1>Prince Andrew: ‘I kick myself’ for staying with convicted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/valerie-richardson/" target="_blank">Valerie Richardson</a></address>
      <p>British <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew/">Prince Andrew</a> said that staying with billionaire sex-offender <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Jeffrey Epstein</a> was the “wrong thing to do,” adding “I kick myself on a daily basis” for that decision.</p>
      <p>In a clip of a BBC interview posted Saturday, the prince said he regretted spending the night at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion in 2010, two years after the financier was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
      <p>“The problem was the fact that once he had been convicted, I stayed with him, and that’s the bit that as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew/">Prince Andrew</a>, who also holds the title of the Duke of York. “Because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family, and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices, and I let the side down, simple as that.”</p>

      <p>He also refuted allegations, as the Palace has previously done, that he engaged in sex with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a> accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times, starting when she was 17 in 2001.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t happen,” said the prince, as reported by BBC, which is slated to air the full interview Saturday night.</p>

        <p>A 2001 photograph shows Prince Andrew standing with his arm around the teenage girl in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a> associate Ghislane Maxwell’s London home, but he said in the interview that “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.”</p>
        <p>His connection to the Epstein accuser was back in the news after Project Veritas released Nov. 5 an off-the-air video of ABC anchor Amy Robach telling a producer on the set that the network refused in 2016 to air her interview with Ms. Giuffre, citing pressure from the Palace.</p>
        <p>“Then the Place found out that we had her whole allegations about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew/">Prince Andrew</a> and threatened us a million different ways,” said Ms. Robach in the leaked video. “We were so afraid we wouldn’t be able to interview Kate and Will, that we—that also quashed the story.”</p>
        <p>She referred to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew/">Prince Andrew</a>’s nephew, Prince William, and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, who hold the titles of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.</p>

        <p>As for his decision to accept <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a>’s hospitality, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew/">Prince Andrew</a> said, “It was a convenient place to stay.”</p>
        <p>“I mean, I’ve gone through this in my mind so many times,” the prince said. “At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one could have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do. But at the time, I felt it was the honorable and right thing to do. And I admit fully that my judgment was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable, but that’s just the way it is.”</p>
        <p>His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, posted a tweet in support of the prince, calling him a “true+real gentleman.”</p>

        <p>In a statement, ABC News said that the Epstein story failed to meet its standard at the time to air, while Ms. Robach said that the camera caught her in a “private moment of frustration.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-epstein/">Epstein</a> was found dead Aug. 10 in his New York City jail cell after being arrested on sex-trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.</p>
