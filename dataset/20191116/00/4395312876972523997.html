      <h2>Our New Global Deal with Nature</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/catherine-cunningham-phd/" target="_blank">Catherine Cunningham, PhD</a></address>
      <p>We access <i>central intelligence</i> databases to analyze trends, to make important decisions, and to launch sensitive missions. We pool <i>national intelligence</i> from different agencies and resources to optimize our foreign relations and national security interests. We craft <i>counter intelligence</i> operations to thwart the political activities of our enemies and to sabotage their economic advance. We build <i>artificial intelligence</i> programs and protocols to manage big data better and to perform manual or computational work faster. We foster <i>functional</i> <i>intelligence </i>in different areas to train our minds and bodies to become superior in a variety of disciplines; like sports, medicine, music, philosophy, art, and science. We prize and reward intelligence of the mind—clever ways of solving problems, creating linear arguments that furthers a particular propaganda message, position, or perspective. We celebrate the intelligence of the body—spending countless hours tracking athletes, watching sports, competing ourselves against one another alone or on teams.</p>
      <p>While these human-centric forms of intelligence are valuable and important to cultivate; I believe it is vital now to our survival to <i>also</i> become more alert, aware, and awake to the <i>natural intelligence</i> of life on earth. What do I mean by natural intelligence?</p>
