      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas is now one win away from capturing the Nitto ATP Finals in his first appearance in the event.The 21-year-old Greek sensation advanced to Sunday’s championship match when he knocked off six-time champion Roger Federer, 6-3, 6-4, in the first semifinal on Saturday.</p>
      <p>After closing the match with an ace, Tsitsipas will face the winner between Dominic Thiem and defending champion Alexander Zverev in Sunday’s final. Thiem leads Tsitsipas 4-2, while Tsitsipas leads Zverev 4-1.</p>
      <p>The winner will take home $1,354,000, with the runner-up landing $657,000.</p>
      <p>“I’m really proud of myself because I went through a lot of difficulties in today’s match,” Tsitsipas said in his on-court interview. “It’s something that I think I deserve because I was in the right state of mind and did things almost up to perfection.”</p>
      <p>As for the final, he said, “Both of them play great tennis, I’ve played both of them and I need to be really prepared for tomorrow because it’s going to be one of the most important finals of my career so far. I need to be mentally there from the very beginning and I honestly have no preference if it’s going to be Zverev or Thiem. I hope they play a long, tiring semifinal.”</p>
      <p>The “Big Three” of Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are now all out of the ATP Finals. Nadal and Djokovic did not qualify for the semifinals.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas improved to 2-2 against Federer, including a massive win in the Australian Open in January en route to a semifinal appearance there.</p>
      <p>After taking the first set, Tsitsipas broke Federer early in the second. Federer broke back to tie it at 2-all, but quickly surrendered the break right back to go down 3-2.

      <p>He was also 1-for-12 on break points after going 0-for-12 in their Australian Open match.</p>
      <p>“I was just trying to survive each one of them,” Tsitsipas said. “I had a similar situation with him at the Australian Open this year when I did save also a lot of break points. But I wasn’t really thinking much. I was sticking to my game plan, just trying to be as aggressive as possible, trying not to give him time and space to execute his own game plan.”</p>
      <p>While the “Big Three” have combined to win 55 total majors and 12 straight, the younger generation now appears poised for a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas is 21, Zverev 22, Daniil Medvedev 23 and Dominic Thiem 26.</p>
      <p>Thiem has lost in back-to-back French Open finals to Nadal, while Medvedev lost an epic five-setter to Nadal in the 2019 U.S. Open.</p>
      <p>With 2020 around the corner, it’s possible one of the younger guys will break through and win his first major – and the first major from that group.</p>
      <p>As for the “Big Three,” they will head into 2020 trying to augment their major totals. Federer has a slim 20-19 lead on Nadal, who could potentially tie and pass the Swiss next year, while Djokovic is lurking close behind at 16.</p>
