      <p>Parliament will this morning begin its post-budget workshop to deliberate on the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>The workshop will afford Members of Parliament the opportunity to critically study the budget as presented to them by the Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta to enable them to sufficiently debate it.</p>
      <p>The two-day event which has mostly been held outside the Greater Accra Region will this time take place at Parliament’s Job 600 Complex, in the national capital, Accra.</p>
      <p>Majority Leader, Osei Kyei Mensah Bonsu who announced the changes on the Floor of Parliament said the move is to save money and make good use of Parliament’s resources.</p>
      <p>“In accordance with the practice in the House, a post-budget workshop has been scheduled for Members of Parliament to enable the honourable members to assimilate the content of the budget. The workshop is expected to be held on 16th November and Sunday, the 17th of November, 2019.”</p>
      <p>“The committee hereby informs the House that all members are expected to participate in the workshop and are accordingly entreated to avail themselves at the post-budget workshop. Mr Speaker since essential information will be provided at the workshop, honourable members are entreated to be in attendance and fully participate.”</p>
      <p>The Finance Minister, Ken Ofori Atta presented the 2020 budget statement in Parliament last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>There were concerns over the absence of road projects for the Volta Region in the budget, compelling Mr Ofori-Atta to later present to Parliament a list of critical roads omitted in the budget.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori-Atta presented the document on Friday and asked Parliament to amend the budget with the new list.</p>
      <p>According to the Finance Minister, his attention was drawn to the omission by the Volta Regional Minister and Energy Minister, John Peter Amewu.</p>
      <p>“On Wednesday, 13th November 2019, I presented the 2020 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of the government of Ghana on behalf of the President of the Republic of Ghana. Following my presentation to this August House, the honourable Volta Regional Minister and the honourable Minister for Energy drew my attention to an omission of the Volta Region from the list of critical roads listed in Table 21 of the budget statement. My checks confirm, Mr. Speaker, the inadvertent omission of Volta Region.”</p>

      <p>“All the Regional Ministers, Mr Speaker, were requested to submit a list of critical roads which required immediate attention. At the instance of the Volta Regional Minister, three roads projects in the Volta Region were prioritised in the list of critical road projects for 2020. As it turned out on page 160 of the budget document, the Volta Region was inadvertently left out. In the event, I am yet to amend table 21 to include the critical roads in the Volta Region as originally agreed on,” he said.</p>

      <p>The Finance Minister in delivering the 2020 budget statement stressed a focus on fixing roads across the country in 2020 and beyond.</p>
      <p>He also indicated, among others that the government will increase the tax-to-GDP ratio from 13 percent to 20 percent in 2020.</p>
