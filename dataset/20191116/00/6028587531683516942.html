      <p>Manchester City’s efforts to stop a Uefa investigation into its finances have been dismissed as “inadmissible” by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), as no final ruling in the case against them has been made by European soccer’s governing body.City denies any wrongdoing, and was looking to avoid hefty sanctions by appealing to the game’s highest court.</p>
      <p>This latest delve into their financial dealings was instigated by the Investigatory Chamber of the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB), Uefa’s financial watchdog.</p>
      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>On May 15, 2019, the Investigatory Chamber suggested that the investigation be picked up by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the CFCB, which has the authority to dish out tougher sanctions, including a ban from European competition.</p>
      <p>“Manchester City is entirely confident of a positive outcome when the matter is considered by an independent judicial body,” <a href="https://www.mancity.com/news/club-news/club-news/2019/may/man-city-club-statement-uefa-response">City said in a statement</a> a day later.</p>
      <p>“The accusation of financial irregularities remains entirely false and the CFCB IC referral ignores a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence provided by Manchester City FC to the Chamber.</p>
      <p>“The decision contains mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a basic lack of due process and there remain significant unresolved matters raised by Manchester City FC as part of what the Club has found to be a wholly unsatisfactory, curtailed, and hostile process.”</p>

      <p>On May 24, 2019, City filed an appeal at the CAS seeking the annulment of the Investigatory Chamber’s decision to refer the matter to the Adjudicatory Chamber.</p>
      <h3>Possible Sanctions</h3>
      <p>It is the referral from the Investigatory Chamber to the Adjudicatory Chamber which City was appealing against, as an investigation by the Adjudicatory Chamber can lead to much tougher sanctions including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A points deduction</li>
        <li>Withholding of Champions League revenues</li>
        <li>Restrictions on the number of players that a club may register in the Champions League. </li>
        <li>Disqualification from European competitions in progress and/or exclusion from future competitions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The maximum fine which can be dished out by the Investigatory Chamber is €200,000, but they can also come to a much larger settlement agreement with the club.</p>
      <p>This was the case when City came to a settlement of €60 million ($63 million) with the Investigatory Chamber during the first Financial Fair Play sanctions in 2014, with the money paid in the form of withheld prize money from Uefa competitions.</p>
      <p>At that time City was given three years to meet certain financial targets, and their net spending in the transfer market was limited until 2016 — the year current head coach Pep Guardiola joined the club.</p>
      <p>Despite the restrictions in place the head coach at the time, Manuel Pellegrini, managed to take the club to its first-ever Champions League semi-final in 2016 where they were narrowly defeated 1-0 on aggregate by Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>The club complied with the sanctions placed upon it and, as per the terms of the settlement, were refunded €40 million of the €60 million fine, with the remaining €20 million deducted from their Champions League prize money across those seasons.</p>
      <p>This time around, as the case lies with the Adjudicatory Chamber, it was thought that this sanction <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/sports/manchester-city-champions-league-uefa.html">could include a ban</a> from European competition in the 2020/21 season and a fine, but a recent report in <a href="https://theathletic.com/1377968/2019/11/14/exclusive-manchester-city-set-to-avoid-champions-league-ban/">the Athletic</a> suggests the club will escape with just a fine.</p>

      <h3>CAS Ruling</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release_6298.pdf">CAS media release</a> states:</p>
      <p>“The CAS Panel determined that MCFC’s appeal was inadmissible, considering that ‘An appeal against the decision of a federation, association or sports-related body may be filed with CAS if the Appellant has exhausted the legal remedies available to it prior to the appeal, in accordance with the statutes or regulations of that body.’ (Article R47 of the CAS Rules). </p>
      <p>“In the present case, the decision rendered by the CFCB IC to refer a case to the CFCB AC is not final and can therefore not be appealed to CAS directly, because the AC is competent to take any of the decisions listed in Article 27 CFCB Procedural Rules, that are described as being final.”</p>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Manchester City cannot appeal to CAS against the decision to refer to the Adjudicatory Chamber, as that decision is not final.</p>
      <p>The Adjudicatory Chamber can issue much harsher sanctions than the Investigatory Chamber which issued the club with FFP sanctions in 2014, which is why the club was so eager to appeal to the game’s highest court.</p>
      <p>A report in the Athletic states that the club will not be banned from European competition, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/sports/manchester-city-champions-league-ban.html">other reports</a> believe a ban could still be issued and also state that the decision by CAS “is not a verdict on any of the underlying accusations against Manchester City.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City maintains that it does not have a case to answer, and that it has not broken FFP rules.</p>
