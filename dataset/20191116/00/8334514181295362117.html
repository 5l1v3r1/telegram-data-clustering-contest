      <p>(Reuters) - Danny Lee’s sizzling start propelled the New Zealander to a one-stroke lead in the rain-delayed Mayakoba Golf Classic in Mexico on Friday.</p>
      <p>Lee put together five birdies and an eagle in his first eight holes while shooting nine-under 62 to pace Americans Brendon Todd and Adam Long, who had 63s, as the weather improved in Playa del Carmen after Thursday’s first-round washout.</p>
      <p>“I changed my swing a little bit to gain distance off the tee,” said the South Korean-born golfer who started play shortly after sunrise.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s been showing me a lot of good results.”</p>
      <p>Lee, the tournament’s runner-up last year, opened play with a birdie, then added another at the fourth hole before his eagle at the par-five fifth. Three more birdies followed.</p>
      <p>He made the turn at seven-under, then added birdies at the 11th, 12th and 13th.</p>
      <p>But he lost his bid for a sub-60 round with a bogey at the par-four 14th, then collected pars on the final four holes.</p>
      <p>Vaughn Taylor, Mark Hubbard, Zach Johnson and Chris Baker shared fourth after shooting seven-under par 64s.</p>
      <p>Billy Horschel and Harris English were at six-under 65 with 14 others at 66 as conditions softened at the Camaleon course in Playa del Carmen.</p>
      <p>Lee has not won on the PGA Tour since 2015 when he topped a four-man playoff at the Greenbrier Classic.</p>
      <p>Todd and Long are also previous winners. Todd’s victory came two weeks ago at the Bermuda Championship and Long claimed the Desert Classic title in January.</p>
      <p>Two other Americans celebrated holes-in-one at the fourth hole. Cameron Tringale aced the 116-yard par-three layout in his 69 and about 45 minutes later rookie Chase Seiffert followed suit while shooting 68.</p>
