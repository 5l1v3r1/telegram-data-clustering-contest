      <p><i>Marie Yovanovitch says her removal played into the hands of ‘shady interests the world over’<br/></i><br/>#Washington <br/><br/>Former American Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch opened the second day of the Trump impeachment hearings on Friday declaring that her abrupt removal by President Donald Trump's administration played into the hands of "shady interests the world over" with dangerous intentions toward the United States. <br/><br/>Yovanovitch told the House Intelligence Committee of a concerted "smear" campaign against her by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others. Her removal is one of several events at the center of the impeachment effort. <br/><br/>"These events should concern everyone in this room," the career diplomat testified in opening remarks. <br/><br/>"Shady interests the world over have learned how little it takes to remove an American ambassador who does not give them what they want." <br/><br/>The daughter of immigrants who fled the former Soviet Union and Nazi German, she described a 33-year career, including three tours as an ambassador to some of the world's tougher postings, before arriving in Ukraine in 2016. She was forced out in April 2019. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the panel, opened day's hearing praising Yovanovitch, saying she was "too tough on corruption for some, and her principled stance made her enemies." <br/><br/>It became clear, he said, "President Trump wanted her gone." <br/><br/>US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday President Donald Trump already has admitted to bribery in the Ukraine scandal at the heart of a Democratic-led inquiry, accusing him of an impeachable offence under the US Constitution.</p>
