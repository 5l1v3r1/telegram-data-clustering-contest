      <h1>Ronaldo targets 100th goal, Euro 2020 berth and revenge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T00:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.besoccer.com/writer/besoccer" target="_blank">BeSoccer</a></address>

        <b>Cristiano Ronaldo travels to Luxembourg on Sunday with the objective of helping reigning champions Portugal qualify for Euro 2020 and the 100-goal mark for his country within his reach.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The<b> former Real Madrid star</b> is also eager to prove he is<b> not a player in decline</b> after his angry reaction to being substituted by <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> coach <b>Maurizio Sarri</b> in the past two games.</p>
      <p>The <b>five-time Ballon d'Or winner,</b> who turns <b>35-</b>years-old in February,<b> responded in typically defiant fashion </b>with <b>a hat-trick in Portugal's 6-0 win</b> over Lithuania on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It brought his tally to <b>98 goals in 163 games</b>, to close in on Iranian striker Ali Daei's world record of 109 international goals scored between 1993 and 2006.</p>
      <p>"I hope that tomorrow (Sunday) <b>he'll score the most goals in his career</b>," Portugal coach Fernando Santos told Saturday's pre-match press conference.</p>
      <p>The <b>symbolic century remains within arm's reach </b>of the striker who despite the passing years has<b> lost none of his lethal firepower.</b></p>
      <p>Already the top Champions League scorer with <b>127 goals, </b>ahead of his long-time rival Lionel Messi, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-ronaldo-28185">Ronaldo</a> this season<b> broke the 700-goal mark</b> in all competitions.</p>
      <p>And with just two weeks to go before the Ballon d'Or trophy is awarded, the player from Madeira has<b> yet another chance to hammer home</b> his point on Sunday.</p>
      <p>A win would <b>help Portugal wrap up a spot at Euro 2020</b> and move on from the their 2-1 loss to Ukraine in Kiev last month. They hold a one-point advantage over Serbia in the battle for second behind <b>Group B</b> winners Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Should they slip up unexpectedly, Ronaldo and co -- winners of the inaugural Nations League -- would have another shot via the play-offs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>- 'No sign of injury' -</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Sunday, <b>Ronaldo will also be keen to prove</b> once again to Sarri that he<b> is physically fit.</b></p>

      <p>The striker reacted furiously after he was substituted in his team's 2-1 Champions League win against Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia on November 6.</p>
      <p>Four days later <b>Ronaldo was again substituted in the Serie A match</b> which the Turin giants won 1-0 against AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was<b> replaced after 55 minutes</b> on the pretext that he had "<b>a slight knee problem</b>", with Paulo Dybala taking his place and scoring the winning goal.</p>
      <p>The controversy swelled when the Italian media revealed that the Portuguese had aimed a few harsh words in Sarri's direction before returning directly to the locker room. </p>
      <p>He <b>left the stadium a few minutes before </b>the final whistle.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo broke his silence by taking to Instagram on Monday, stating: <b>"Difficult game, important victory! #until the end."</b></p>
      <p>His status could prevent him from being hit with a penalty or fine by Juve, but <b>he should not escape a grilling by club</b> vice-president Pavel Nedved, according to the Italian sports press.</p>
      <p>Despite Ronaldo's poor performance last Sunday, his demonstration on Thursday against Lithuania led to <b>a softening in tone in the Italian media, </b>who had blasted his <b>"lack of respect"</b> for his team-mates.</p>
      <p>"Here (in Portugal) CR7 does not go, he embraces (the coach) Fernando Santos and he remains on the bench. (...)<b> It is clear that we do not waste time to demolish players,</b> including champions," wrote Corriere dello Sport. </p>
      <p>Relieved, the Portuguese press, heaped praise on Ronaldo after he scored<b> his ninth international hat-trick</b> "with no sign of injury". </p>
      <p>Portugal will <b>again rely on their talisman captain</b> Sunday, and bank on his goals to do the talking.</p>
