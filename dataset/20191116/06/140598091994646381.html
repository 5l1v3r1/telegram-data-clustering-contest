      <p>The flavour of this dip is incredible – richly savoury, spicy, salty, tinged with sweetness – the best way to completely satisfy the palate is to serve it with something succulent and bitter.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 10 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>40g flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>A few sprigs each of tarragon, basil and chervil (optional)</li>
        <li>50g capers</li>
        <li>A few caper leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>1 small tin of anchovies and their oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme or a few dried thyme flower heads</li>
        <li>½ tsp chilli flakes, plus a little more to taste, if desired</li>
        <li>½ tsp freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>A pinch of caster sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Sea salt (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>To serve</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A few heads of Belgian endive, separated into leaves, or cut into thin wedges, or any other kind of crisp winter leaves, such as slender, curling tardivo (fiori d’Inverno) or puntarelle.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Finely chop all the herbs, capers, caper leaves, if using, and the anchovies.</li>
        <li>Put in a bowl and add the mustard, tomato purée, vinegar, thyme, chilli flakes and white pepper. Stir to combine, then whisk in the olive oil.</li>
        <li> Leave to stand for a few minutes, then taste. If you haven’t used the sweeter herbs you may need to add a pinch of sugar, and if you haven’t used salted capers or anchovies, you may want to add salt.</li>
        <li> Adjust according to your taste and transfer to a serving bowl, or for future use, a sterilised jar.</li>
        <li>Arrange the endives on a platter and serve with the dip. If you have any left, store in a sterilised jar in the fridge, covered with a little olive oil.</li>
      </ol>
