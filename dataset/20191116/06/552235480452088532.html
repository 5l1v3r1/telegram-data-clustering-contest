      <h1>Lewis Mayo reveals relentless Rangers training regime as Alfredo Morelos and Jermain Defoe provide ultimate school of hard knocks</h1>
      <h2>The Rangers kid is raring to go up against Wrexham in the Tunnocks Caramel Cup.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McCarthy, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/david-mccarthy/</a></address>
      <p>Lewis Mayo is a straight A pupil but not all of his brains are in his head.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> kid's feet are pretty intelligent as well and every day they are getting a football education money can't buy.</p>
      <p>Mayo's excellence for the Rangers Colts has earned him a promotion from the club's youth department to the first team dressing room at the Hummel Training Centre and that means the 19-year-old centre back is mixing it with Alfredo Morelos and Jermain Defoe.</p>
      <p>And he is smart enough to be grateful for the experience.</p>
      <p>Mayo has already tasted first team football at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> , having scored in the 5-0 demolition of Oxford United in a pre-season friendly, and admits he can't wait for another outing at the stadium against Wrexham in this afternoon's Tunnocks Cup quarter final.</p>
      <p>"The Oxford game was a special day for me," he said. "I am a Rangers fan, I have been here for a long time, so to score a goal was special for me and my family. The reassuring thing for me was that when I stepped out, I felt confident.</p>
      <p>"There was a rush of blood at the start but I had to trust that the years of preparation and training I had done in the Academy had me ready for it.</p>

      <p>"When I stepped onto the pitch, I was confident in myself. But I was surrounded by a lot of quality players as well. My family were in the stand, so they had a fun day as well.</p>
      <p>"So that is a confidence boost knowing that I can do it and experience I can take into games in the future.</p>
      <p>"Connor Goldson has been brilliant with me, he has always had an eye out for me when I play alongside him and he works with me.</p>
      <p>"Jermain Defoe has been excellent as well because I play against him. He will tell me what I am doing well.</p>
      <p>"It is hard and the thing is, it is either him or Alfredo Morelos in training, so you are not really getting a break. It is one or the other.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"They are both top quality strikers that are at the top of their game. As a learning experience, you are not going to get much better than that going and playing against them."</p>
      <p>Mayo speaks with a maturity and confidence that belies his age and manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> has been so impressed with his leadership qualities that he personally supervised Mayo's promotion to the first team environment.</p>
      <p>"It was the gaffer that said to me (to move to the first team dressing room). You have got to take confidence that a player like him, a man like him and a manager like him is backing you. You have to take that as a really positive sign.</p>
      <p>"It was a massive milestone for me. I have been here since I was seven and that is what I have been working towards all those years.</p>

      <p>"For me, that was personally a massive achievement to move round. But there is an added responsibility because you are in there and you need to be ready to step in when asked.</p>
      <p>"Of course I have still got to be performing in the games here while I am training with the first team."</p>
      <p>One of those games is the Wrexham tie, and having already knocked out 'men's' teams in the shape of Berwick, Stranraer, Ballymena and Solihull - all away from home - Mayo has no doubt <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/graeme-murty">Graeme Murty</a> 's boys will give a good account of themselves.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "When you look at our team, we have got some really exciting players and a lot of quality in our team. We are not first team, we don’t have the experience of the senior players, but given the journey we have had already and some of the teams we have put ourselves up against, we are showing how much quality we have. Hopefully we can go all the way.</p>
      <p>"Even in the past years when we weren’t successful and we were getting beat and put out in the early rounds, it was still a good experience because we still learned from it.</p>
      <p>"I think it shows that the players in this squad have matured because we are able to go and compete and get results."</p>
