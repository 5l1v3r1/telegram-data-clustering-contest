      <h1>The Corinthian spirit that made Queen’s Park special has gone with their amateur status - Gordon Parks</h1>
      <h2>A former Queen's Park player, Gordon Parks reflects on the momentous end to their amateur status.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Parks, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-parks/</a></address>
      <p>AS a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-fc">Queen’s Park</a> alumnus it’s with a heavy heart we hear they’ve cast their Corinthian values to the wind.</p>
      <p>Welcome Spiders, to the sordid world of professional football where the vulgarity of it all is about to be laid bare.</p>
      <p>In the end it was dressed up as being centred around survival but the truth is something much more basic, it was about the money and the winning.</p>
      <p>At an Extraordinary General Meeting on Thursday, my old club voted to bring 152 years of proud amateur status to an end – and for 91 per cent of the members there’s only shame.</p>
      <p>What former custodians such as Eddie Hunter made of it all is anyone’s guess but “Off his Heddie” as he was known would probably have had a few expletives aired when the news filtered through.</p>
      <p>There was a uniqueness about Queen’s, a true bastion of tradition who showed the game was something more than buying and selling, who can get what out of it in the horse-trading world which has been a race to the bottom in moral standards.</p>
      <p>My debut was against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ayr-united-fc">Ayr United</a> and after a career of hearing all about this historic Hampden institution, it was a proud moment.</p>

      <p>Then Ross Caven shouted seconds before kick-off for me to get my shirt outside my shorts.</p>
      <p>It was with an indignant rage that the order came through and a man who played 592 games and went on to become president proceeded to explain that it’s always been this way. To a man, shirts outside the shorts and as for the pants, for 72 minutes before being hauled off, I was.</p>
      <p>Caven played 592 games, decades of service, Richie Sinclair the same, Kevin McGoldrick, my best mate since we met as five-year-olds at primary school, gave his career to the Spiders and this was written about them all a few years ago by another past president.</p>
      <p>“I can’t overstate my admiration for these guys. All of them had chances to turn professional yet stayed with us.</p>
      <p>“Why was this? It is difficult to say. Loyalty? Love for the club? The realisation that the grass may not be greener? Who knows.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that each of them are proud men with a strong personality; perhaps that is important. Ross is a past president, Richard sits on the club committee.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It’s a brilliant passage. It says everything about what Queen’s were all about.</p>
      <p>It was about the service, the camaraderie and about playing for the love of the game.</p>
      <p>Nostalgia is one thing and there were some realities which the club have had to confront.</p>
      <p>The biggest carrot they offered potential signings was the chance to grace <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hampden-park">Hampden</a> every second week. That has now gone due to the sale of the national stadium to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-football-association">SFA</a> but it’s not as though the club is scratching about for the cash to keep them- <br/>selves afloat.</p>
      <p>There was a need to protect themselves and their youth structure which had big clubs cherry-picking the best of their talent but there could have been another way.</p>
      <p>Money makes the world go round and much has been made of their failure to be land any transfer fees for a host of youngsters who’ve gone on to bigger things. But that again is a bit of a myth.</p>
      <p>It’s very rare for any club from Leagues One and Two to develop players who land them huge transfer windfalls.</p>
      <p>It almost never happens at all.</p>

      <p>What Queen’s can now do is attract boys who’d normally never consider them by throwing a few bob their way.</p>
      <p>In my day it was expenses on a Thursday night, some envelopes were bigger than others but that’s a road to go down another day.</p>
      <p>They operate in a market where it’s relative pocket money for lower-league players, but they have now heaped a bit of pressure on themselves.</p>
      <p>From this moment on they’ll need to find the cash to be the competitive club they crave to be and that’s a situation which puts their long-term security at risk.</p>
      <p>There are many shaking their heads and throwing their bowler hats to the floor in disgust as this week’s development.</p>
      <p>And with it a warning: Alea iacta est. The die is cast.</p>
