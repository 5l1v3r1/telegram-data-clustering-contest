        <b>Remixes of Marjaavaan have got the Internet buzzing. We provide you what the singer of their originals Sapna Mukherjee things about it</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marjaavaan has not made much noise at the ticket windows and understandably so, but what has got people talking about it is that it contains two remixes of songs from Feroz Khan's films. The songs in question are Ek Toh Kum Zindagani from Jaanbaaz and Haiya Ho Haiya from Dayavan. So what are people talking? Well, whenever there's a remix, it's a house divided. This time, we decided to ask the singer Sapna Mukherjee who in fact gave her voice to both the numbers in their original version.  </p>
      <p>Said Sapna Mukherjee, "I am liking it, I am enjoying it. It is good to see remixes/recreations of your own songs, which implies that they are still in demand today. Many of my songs have had a second version in recent times and I think the young brigade wants it that way.</p>

      <p>I am happy that Bhushan Kumar (T-Series) is incorporating remixes. I have absolutely no problem.</p>

      <p>But I can vouch for one thing. You cannot beat Feroz Khan's touch in the original, which means my first choice would definitely be the original. Feroz saab, Raj Kapoor saab... un logon ki baat hi kuch aur thi.</p>

      <p>But if the need of the hour is remixed versions, so be it. The new versions are widely heard and seen on the Internet. </p>
      <p>All said and done, I see this change in a positive manner."    </p>
