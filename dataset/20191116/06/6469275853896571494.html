      <h1>How Preston North End role helped Sean Maguire get off the mark at international level</h1>

        <b>Sean Maguire thinks being able to replicate the role he plays for Preston helped him score his first goal for the Republic of Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old netted in the Emerald Isle’s 3-1 win over New Zealand in a friendly at the Aviva Stadium on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Maguire was handed a starting role on the left-hand side of the attack, similar to the position he has filled for PNE for the majority of this season.</p>
      <p>He pulled the trigger from 20 yards to find the net and now hopes to be involved in the Republic’s must-win Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark on Monday night.</p>
      <p>It was Maguire’s seventh international cap, the goal coming two years on from his Ireland debut.</p>
      <p>Maguire said: “I have played off the left at Preston all of this season and I think I have been doing really well there. When the gaffer told me I was going to be playing off the left, I fancied myself to get in positions to score.</p>
      <p>“I was absolutely delighted to score – it is a dream to score for your country.</p>
      <p>“It’s about time too, it is just over two years since I made my debut against Moldova – it’s been a long time coming.”</p>
      <p>Not too many of Maguire’s 16 goals for Preston have come from outside the box.</p>
      <p>His three this season were close-range efforts but he was on the edge of the ‘D’ when he rifled home Ireland’s second goal in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Said Maguire: “The one I scored was probably the hardest of the four or five chances I got. When I got it out of my feet and struck the ball, I knew it was going in.”</p>
      <p>Maguire played 73 minutes on Thursday, PNE team-mate Alan Browne substituted after 66 minutes.</p>
      <p>Both are likely to be in the matchday squad for the Denmark game, probably on the bench to start with.</p>
      <p>Maguire seems to have found himself a niche in the North End side on the left.</p>
      <p>He played as the central striker in the opening-day defeat at Millwall and did not make much impact against two physical centre-backs.</p>
      <p>The move to the side, playing as an inside-forward rather than a winger, has seen him get more joy.</p>
      <p>Maguire was on target in the victories against Wigan, Brentford and Birmingham.</p>
      <p>He played particularly well against Huddersfield last week and has been enjoying his longest run of matches in the Lilywhites side since signing from Cork City for £130,000 in July 2017.</p>
      <p>If the Republic can beat Denmark in Dublin, there would be the chance for Maguire and Browne to play in next summer’s Euros.</p>
      <p>The tournament is being played around Europe rather than in one country, with Dublin a host city.</p>
