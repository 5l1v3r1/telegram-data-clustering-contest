      <h1>You're welcome Rangers, a letter from HMRC - OldFirmFacts</h1>
      <h2>The taxman insists it's time that Rangers fans showed some gratitude, in a letter seen by OldFirmFacts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Old Firm Facts</a></address>
      <p>Pity poor John Lewis. Every year they invest millions in a Christmas marketing campaign that dominates the national conversation for days. Every year they stick to the same successful formula, in which a popular song is performed in a twee fashion by a popular musician (Lily Allen, Ellie Goudling, Elton John) while a charming creature with vaguely human features tugs at the heartstrings (Monty the Penguin, Moz the Monster, Elton John).</p>
      <p>Why pity them? When they chose Thursday November 14th as the launch date for this year’s ad, they would have had no idea that the adventures of a lovable dragon would be comprehensively overshadowed by a reboot of the nation’s favourite story: Rangers v HMRC.</p>
      <p>Yep, it’s back!. As the story broke on Thursday night that HMRC might just have got their sums wrong when it came to Rangers, the dormant ‘Accountancy and Sevco’ cottage industry sprung to life. With the words “multimillion-pound blunder by the tax authorities”, John Lewis’ thunder was stolen. If nothing else, the fact that it was only after The Banter Years appeared to have finished that it turned out The Banter Years possibly didn’t even need to have happened is a classic Banter Years twist.</p>
      <p>This might shock you, but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> fans weren’t particularly impressed. @ConnorM1872 asked “Are you telling me I watched Ian Black pinging balls through to Jon Daly for f*** all?” while@fraserm55 wondered “Can I sue HMRC for ruining my teenage years?”.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, one of my contacts within the MSM anti-Rangers conspiracy cult has leaked a forthcoming letter from HMRC which will be sent to every man in Scotland and Northern Ireland whose Twitter handle ends in ‘72’.</p>
      <p>It’s reproduced in full below.</p>
      <p>Dear Rangers fans,</p>
      <p>HMRC here. We’ve been inundated with irate letters from you since Thursday night - just 10 short of 1,700 at the last count.</p>
      <p>It’s only right then that we set some things straight. You appear to have been stirred into action by a newspaper headline reading “Tax officials blamed for the downfall of Rangers”.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>First of all, this headline is misleading. ‘Tax officials thanked for the downfall of Rangers’ would be more accurate if the last seven years of tweets from @sevcohater67, @zombiesevco67 and @sevcosevcosevcothisisallihavepleasedontleavemesharon67 are anything to go by.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you’re acting like this was somehow a bad thing. Like the minor inconvenience of having to climb up through the lower leagues while watching your greatest rivals rack up trophy after trophy is somehow not worth all the good things that came out of it.</p>
      <p>Don’t pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about. Do the words “We’re the Rangers, we’re no strangers to collecting silver in May?” mean nothing to you? How about “We’re the Queen’s eleven, from royal blue heaven, we don’t do walking away”? That’s right, the guy with the dancing shoulders would never have released his musical masterpiece “We Don’t Do Walking Away’ had we not intervened.</p>
      <p>Still raging with us? How about the first game of your journey, when a team simultaneously featuring the captain of the USA's national team and Kyle Hutton required extra time to beat Brechin at Glebe Park and a ball got stuck in a hedge?</p>
      <p>What about Bilel Mohsni’s meltdown at Fir Park? In fact, what about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bilel-mohsni">Bilel Mohsni</a> full stop?</p>
      <p>You’re seriously telling us you didn’t enjoy any of this? Not even Maryn Waghorn demanding that a schoolboy “Say it to me face” only for the schoolboy to remain completely unrattled and say it to his face?</p>
      <p>No laughs to be had losing to Annan Athletic at Ibrox? Fran Sandaza falling for a taxi driver pretending to be an agent not tickling your funny bone?</p>
      <p>You seriously mean to tell us you weren’t even amused by the Elgin City dancer, ‘Same old Alloa, always cheating’, Charles Green being interviewed on his hospital bed by Jim White, Charles Green’s Christmas video, Dundee United fans singing ‘Zombie’ by the Cranberries for an entire 45 minutes during their 3-0 win against you at Tannadice, Ian Black pretending to pick up the corner flag after being sent off in that same game, Emílson Cribari, Sébastien Faure, Kevin Kyle, The Newcastle Five, John Brown demanding to be shown the deeds, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-whyte">Craig Whyte’s</a> ‘Chewin’ the fat teacher’ accent, Craig Whyte’s smile, Craig Whyte’s words, losing the Ramsdens Cup Final to Raith Rovers, celebrating the Petrofac Cup Final win against Peterhead with a straight face, 1,888 Sevco blogs and the AGM gazebo?</p>
      <p>You guys need to lighten up. We were p***ing ourselves.</p>
      <p>Yours,</p>
      <p>Hector</p>
