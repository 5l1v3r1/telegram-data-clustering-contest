      <p>This is the top of the dense, woody stalk of Brussels sprouts, where the stem, still dotted with tiny nuggets of nutty-flavoured sprouts, broadens into a perfect head of tightly furled leaves surrounded by a loose crown of floppy green leaves.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Nick off the sprouts with a sharp knife and pull off all of the looser leaves. Discard the woodiest part of the stem, then cut the head into wedges. To cook, put a large slice of butter in a pan with a splash of water.</li>
        <li>When the butter has melted, add everything together and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Toss gently, then tightly cover and leave for around 10 to 12 minutes over a gentle heat, checking regularly.</li>
        <li>When you can easily pierce the sprouts with a knife tip, they are done. Serve immediately with the buttery juices.</li>
      </ol>
