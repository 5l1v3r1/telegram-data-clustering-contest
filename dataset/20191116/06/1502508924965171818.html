      <p>Senior journalist Rajat Sharma on Saturday resigned from the post of president of Delhi &amp; Districts Cricket Association (DDCA), citing his inability to continue amidst "various pulls and pressures" within the organisation.</p>
      <p>Sharma's nearly 20-month tenure was a tumultuous one with his public differences with general secretary Vinod Tihara, who enjoys a fair amount of support base in the organisation.</p>
      <p>"The cricket administration here is full of pulls and pressures all the time. I feel that vested interests are always actively working against the interest of cricket," Sharma said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"It seems that it may not be possible to carry on in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ddca">DDCA </a>with my principles of integrity, honesty and transparency, which I am not willing to compromise at any cost," he added.</p>
      <p>Sharma had joined cricket administration after receiving active backing from former finance minister late <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-arun-jaitley">Arun Jaitley.</a></p>
      <p>Many <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ddca">DDCA </a>insiders believe that Sharma lost ground once Jaitley was no more as the late former finance minister was the binding force for all the different factions.</p>
      <p>"In my endeavour though I faced many road blocks, opposition and oppression, just to keep me from discharging my duties in fair and transparent," Sharma said.</p>
      <p>"That's why I have decided to call it a day and hereby tender my resignation to the Apex Council from the post of President, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ddca">DDCA </a>with immediate effect," he added.</p>
