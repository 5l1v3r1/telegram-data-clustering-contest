      <p>A former member of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Wadada, has asked governors not willing to pay the N30,000 minimum wage to quit.</p>
      <p>Wadada, who spoke  in Lafia on Friday, wondered why  governors budgeting  between N200m and N400m for  security in their states  would not pay  the minimum wage.</p>
      <p>The Nasarawa State politician said, “I find it ridiculous for anybody to be foot-dragging on the  minimum wage.</p>
      <p>“The N30,000 minimum wage is less than $100. Some governors take N200m, N300m and N400m  as security votes. I have heard of a governor who  took N1bn every month  as security vote  for eight years. I have been  to that state and there is nothing the man  did.</p>
      <p>“Whoever cannot pay the N30,000 minimum wage should pack his belongings and go  because he  is not fit to be a governor.”</p>
      <p>Wadada, who was one of the governorship aspirants during the 2019 governorship election in the state, however, called for a  thorough investigation into  the use  of  the bailout and budget support funds released to state governments before the commencement of deductions by the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>Wadada advised the new governors to look at the books and take decisions that best suit their states based on what they met on the ground.</p>
