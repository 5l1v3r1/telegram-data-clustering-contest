      <h1>Yu Darvish gives Astros pass on sign-stealing, then gets roasted by Christian Yelich over video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:57:53+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:57</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Gatto</a></address>
      <p>In less than 24 hours, Yu Darvish went from giving the Astros the benefit of the doubt to taking an L on Twitter against Christian Yelich over whether Yelich may have been getting signs at Miller Park while facing him.</p>
      <p>First, Darvish took the high road Thursday as he discussed being knocked out by Houston in the second inning of Game 7 in the 2017 World Series while pitching for the Dodgers.</p>
      <p>Darvish made the comments after former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers told The Athletic that Houston was using a video system to steal signs at Minute Maid Park that year. The Astros-Dodgers Game 7 was played in Los Angeles,however.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"If you ask me if I got hit in Game 7 because (the Astros) stole signs, I don't think so," he said in Japanese, which <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2019-11-15/yu-darvish-astros-cheating-dodgers">the Los Angeles Times translated into English</a>. "The Astros have great players who don't have to do that. So I think that whether or not they stole signs, the results wouldn't have changed."</p>
      <p>The belief at the time was that Darvish was tipping his pitches, although the Astros had also been supected of electronic spying, something they're accused of still doing.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Darvish's back-and-forth with Yelich came about when a Bleacher Report contributor posted video from a Cubs-Brewers game last Sept. 7 that purportedly showed Yelich glancing toward the Brewers' bullpen in left-center field just before Darvish was about to pitch. (The almost-imperceptible eye movement in question happens about 12 seconds into the video.) Darvish stepped off the rubber right after.</p>

      <p>Darvish replied that Yelich's furtive glance caused him to step off. That response annoyed Yelich to the point he tweeted back this:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That led Darvish to respond that he wasn't accusing Yelich or the Brewers of anything.</p>

      <p>Yelich's career numbers against Darvish are good — 4 for 11 (.364 average) with two home runs —but the larger issue in the Twitterverse (and the main reason theB-R contributor put up the video) is that there have been rumors the Brewers steal signs at home. Yelich did not specify where he was looking in the B-R video or why his eyes might have wandered.</p>
      <p>To add to the popcorn factor of this whole episode, free-agent third baseman Josh Donaldson decided to insert himself into the exchange:</p>

      <p>Darvish came back with:</p>

      <p>Donaldson is 4 for 25 (.160) with 12 strikeouts lifetime vs. Darvish.</p>
