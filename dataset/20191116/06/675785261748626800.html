      <h1>Moise Kean's dad demands Everton striker leaves England and returns to Serie A</h1>
      <h2>Jean Kean says £27m forward is not settled at Everton and urges Roma switch - as he claims Juventus still owe him two tractors</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:34:31+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Moise Kean's dad has said his son's £27million move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> was a mistake - and demanded the striker return to Italy 'as soon as possible'.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/moise-kean">Kean</a> joined Everton from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> in the summer in what was regarded as something of a coup - but the Italy under-21 international's father says his son is not happy at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Jean Kean wants the 19-year-old to return to Serie A, citing Roma as his preferred destination.</p>
      <p>And he has claimed Juventus still owe him two tractors.</p>
      <p>Jean Kean told Centro Suono Sport: "Sending my son to England was a mistake, because he's still too young, he's not feeling good at Everton, I didn't like this transfer.</p>

      <p>"I hope he can come back to Italy as soon as possible, I hope he goes to Rome, but the important thing is that he comes back here.</p>
      <p>"At Everton, where he is playing now, he is not settling in well. I think he was supposed to wait a few more years before he had an experience abroad.</p>
      <p>"If there is a possibility for him to come back to Italy, I hope he can do that, so as not to ruin him."</p>
      <p>Kean has made 10 Premier League appearances for Everton so far this season, but has started only twice and is yet to score.</p>

      <p>His dad said Juventus owe him two tractors from an agreement made when Kean was 14.</p>
      <p>"I believe in God and I believe in promises," he said. "But if their word was a lie I can’t trust them anymore. They promised me two tractors and they still haven’t been given to me.</p>
      <p>"When he was 14, Marotta (Giuseppe) called me and took him to Turin, he could have ended up in England. On that occasion he promised me two tractors, to help my brothers in exchange for signing him to Juventus."</p>
      <p>AC Milan and Roma are reported to be interested in taking the striker on loan in January.</p>
