      <p>Desert Pines running back Javontae Barnes wants to perform well in the Class 4A state playoffs to honor his grandmother, who died last weekend.</p>
      <p>After his performance Friday night against Faith Lutheran, there’s no doubt he’s on his way to doing that.</p>
      <p>The sophomore running back ran for 197 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries as the host Jaguars rolled past the Crusaders 41-17 in the Mountain Region quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>“It means so much,” Barnes said. “All she wanted me to do was chase my dreams and make it to the (NFL). I’ve dreamed about that since I was 3 years old. My last text message from her was actually last week, and she said to do it for her, so that’s what I did. I’m doing this whole thing for her.”</p>
      <p>On the Jaguars’ fourth-quarter scoring drive, Barnes did it all — 65 yards and a touchdown on four carries. He credited his offensive teammates for opening the holes throughout the game.</p>
      <p>“We came out here as brothers, as a team,” Barnes said. “We fought, had a strong battle, but we came out with the ‘dub’ (win).”</p>
      <p>Faith Lutheran took an early 3-0 lead when Alex Khachoyan hit a 23-yard field goal.</p>
      <p>The Jaguars responded on their opening possession, a six-play, 62-yard scoring drive capped by a 12-yard run by Barnes.</p>
      <p>The Crusaders then fumbled the ensuing kickoff, which lead to a 1-yard scoring run by Darius Stewart to give the Jaguars a 13-3 lead.</p>
      <p>Faith Lutheran drove to the Desert Pines 22 on its next possession, but an interception by Jett Solomon led to a 20-yard scoring strike from Rjay Tagataese to Malik Brooks to give the Jaguars a 20-3 lead.</p>
      <p>“It was a total team effort,” Desert Pines coach Tico Rodriguez said. “Faith is a great program, led by a great man and great head coach. And we were just excited to come up on top.</p>
      <p>“We were just really physical up front with the offense and defensive line. We were able to impose our will on both and just control the game.”</p>
      <p>The Crusaders’ offense got back on track in the second quarter, as quarterback Riley Schwartz hit Quenton Rice for a 20-yard touchdown pass to cut the deficit to 20-11.</p>
      <p>Schwartz led the Crusaders with 313 yards passing and two touchdowns. Peyton Thornton had 10 catches for 113 yards and a TD.</p>
      <p>The Jaguars quickly regained the momentum when Tagataese hit Deandre Moore for a 40-yard TD pass with 29 seconds remaining in the first half.</p>
      <p>Stewart scored on a 59-yard TD run in the third quarter to push the Jaguars’ lead to 34-11.</p>
      <p>“Those turnovers (in the first quarter) really got us going, but we kind of sputtered in the second quarter,” Rodriguez said. “This team is a resilient team, and we’re always a second-half team, so it was good to see the guys not panic and stay poised under fire.”</p>
      <p>Desert Pines will host Canyon Springs next week in the second round. The Jaguars defeated the Pioneers 49-14 in the regular season.</p>
