      <h1>'Mood for change': Greens members push for direct election of party leadership</h1>

      <p>Greens co-deputy leader Adam Bandt says there is a "role for greater membership involvement" as the party moves to decide whether it will directly elect its parliamentary leader by May next year.</p>
      <p>At the party's national conference on Saturday, Mr Bandt said the parliamentary party had been talking "a lot" about increasing members' participation in leadership votes.</p>
      <p>"It's fair to say that MPs understand and appreciate the mood for change and want to be a part of it," Mr Bandt told <i>The Sun-Herald</i> and <i>Sunday Age.</i></p>

      <p>With the backing of leader Richard Di Natale, Greens members have been talking about changing the structure of process of its parliamentary leadership for years. This includes changing to a model of co-leadership - where there is a male and non-male leader - popular with other Greens parties around the world.</p>
      <p>But progress on the issue has been slow, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53aqm.html">with former Greens senator Andrew Bartlett urging the party to "get on" with plans earlier this week</a>. Other Greens explain progress has been hampered by the wide range of views on how the new system could work.</p>
      <p>Some in the party think the current model - where MPs elect the leader - is working, but others want a mixed model like Labor where members and MPs have a vote, while others again want to hand the decision entirely over to members.</p>
      <p>Party members have been consulted about the change in recent months, and had a private meeting about the issue on Saturday at their national conference. The party's national council will discuss how to structure the decision-making process at a meeting on Monday, with plans to have the matter settled by May next year.</p>
      <p>Senator Di Natale was due to give a <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53auj.html">major speech asking Greens members to embrace a Green New Deal on Saturday</a>. But due to complications from recent knee surgery, he was unable to attend his party's conference.</p>
      <p>Senator Di Natale wants the Greens to spend the next year consulting with party members and the community to develop a plan to tackle the "overlapping crises of climate destruction and economic inequality".</p>
      <p>Mr Bandt, who delivered the speech on Senator Di Natale's behalf, said the party needed to come up with a "believable job-centred" plan to deal with climate change or "the Coalition could be in power for a very long time".</p>
      <p>Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said she was excited about the prospects of a Green New Deal, which would show people how the economy could adapt to deal with climate change.</p>
      <p>"That's the kind of hope that we need right now," she said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53a9t.html">sparked controversy by comparing the Labor and Liberal party to "arsonists" because of their climate change policies</a>. Senator Steele-John said he stood by his comments.</p>
