      <h1>Grilled chicory with pangrattato recipe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/catherine-phipps/" target="_blank">Catherine Phipps</a></address>
      <p>This dish uses the central part of chicory (also known as endive) to show its beautiful cross section – do not waste the rest of the chicory, it can be braised or shredded into a salad. You can use anything for this – including lettuces such as little gem, or wedges of cabbage.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>: 10 minutes | <b>Cooking time</b>: 10 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the pangrattato</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>30g sourdough chunks</li>
        <li>30g walnuts</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 sprigs of rosemary, quite finely chopped</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the endive</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 large heads of endive, cabbage or lettuce, such as chioggia</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>First make the pangrattato. Crumble up the sourdough into fairly fine breadcrumbs and chop or process the walnuts to the same texture. Do not over-process the walnuts as they will start leaching oil.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic and fry for a minute over a medium heat without colouring, then add the breadcrumbs and rosemary. Fry for a few more minutes until the breadcrumbs are golden brown. Stir in the lemon zest.</li>
        <li>To cut two cross sections from each endive, cut around 2½cm to the side of the core, then cut the centre piece you end up with down the middle. Heat a large frying pan and lightly coat with olive oil.</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, add the pieces of endive and cook for two to four minutes on each side, until the flesh is lightly charred and the leaves are wilting.</li>
        <li> Scatter over the pangrattato and serve with lemon wedges, for squeezing over.</li>
      </ol>
