      <h1>What Nets’ Jarrett Allen needs to do to reach All-Star level</h1>

      <p>CHICAGO — The Nets are convinced Jarrett Allen is going to be an All-Star, but they need the 21-year-old center to grow from a wildly inconsistent player to a winning one.</p>
      <p>Allen had five fouls and just five points Sunday at Phoenix and fouled out after scoring just four points Tuesday at Utah. Two days later, however, he had 17 points and 10 rebounds, largely outplaying Nikola Jokic to the point Denver pulled its star center.</p>
      <p>The fact the Nets have no clue which Allen will show up Saturday to face the Bulls is the kind of unpredictability they want to wean him off of.</p>
      <p>“I thought Jarrett Allen was really good [in Denver], and then obviously DeAndre [Jordan] supports that. But I thought Jarrett Allen was fantastic,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “We need him to be more consistent, quite honestly. We can’t have the up-and-down Jarrett Allen. We need him every night to be like he was [Thursday]. He was really good.”</p>
      <p>Allen is averaging 9.3 points on 61.9 percent shooting and 8.7 rebounds, the latter two marks career-highs. But watching him post a plus-29 in a win over Houston and a minus-20 four games later at Phoenix prompted Atkinson to request more consistency from his young center.</p>
      <p>“He said it to you a lot nicer,” Allen said. “[He was] just saying I need to bring that same intensity. Every day I’m searching for what gives me that same intensity. It’s part of me growing as a basketball player and playing with that intensity every game.”</p>
      <p>For his part, Allen noted his recent foul woes were mostly on the offensive end, and he has worked to be less haphazard there.</p>
      <p>“It was a little of everything, I was probably just a little too sporadic on the offensive end, just being too physical,” Allen said. “But at the end of the day that’s part of basketball, I just had to tone it down.”</p>

      <p>With last season’s starting power forward (Rodions Kurucs) banished from the rotation, and next season’s (Kevin Durant) still recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon, the Nets need somebody to spell Taurean Prince.</p>
      <p>Atkinson has taken to experimenting with rookie Nic Claxton playing alongside Allen and Jordan, instead of just backing them up.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to get our best talent on the floor,” Atkinson said. “I think he’s a talented guy. We need to find a way to play him.”</p>

      <p>Garrett Temple got four or five stitches on his chin during the game against the Nuggets.</p>
