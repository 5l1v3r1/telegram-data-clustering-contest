      <p>People may have been saying, ‘Alexa tell me a joke’ ever since the known-it-all voice assistance came to existence, but the Amazon CEO recently demonstrated how its sense of humour has got only better with time. Sharing a video on Instagram recently, Jeff Bezos showed what happened when a Sir Patrick Stewart, famous for portraying Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the Star Trek series met the company’s voice assistant and the joke which left the actor quite impressed.</p>
      <p>Stewart was on a tour of the company’s Seattle campus for his upcoming web television series, ‘Star Trek: Picard’. “We tried to give Alexa a bit of a sense of humour and a personality. We actually employed a team of copywriters…” Jeff Bezos explains to the 79-year-old actor at the beginning of the video.</p>
      <p>The English actor then decided to test her and asked, “Alexa, who is your favourite Star Trek captain?”</p>
      <p>Much to the delight of the audience, the gadget responds, “Of all the captains in all the galaxies, Captain Picard is my favourite.”</p>

      <p>That’s not all. Bezos then asked Alexa to share jokes on Thanksgiving and William Shakespeare. When Bezos asked for a Bard of Avon joke, Alexa quipped: “Why did Macbeth cross the road? To get to the regicide.”</p>
      <p>The video left many Star Trek fan excited online and the video quickly went viral garnering positive feedback.</p>
