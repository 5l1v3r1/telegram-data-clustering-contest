      <p>Babestation model <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/12/playboy-model-tweets-need-solisitor-told-pay-3100-court-10731609/">Kayleigh Wanless</a> claims a messy <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">court</a> saga has left her unable to get a home.</p>
      <p>The glamour model can earn thousands of pounds doing photo shoots for the likes of Playboy, yet claims she's "sofa surfing" with friends because no landlord trusts her.</p>
      <p>It follows a feud between Miss Wanless and her ex-boyfriend's aunt Donnis Brown, who claimed the model hadn't repaid a Â£3,100 loan despite persistent demands.</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/babestation-model-tweets-i-need-16890603">judge sided with Ms Brown</a> and ordered the 29-year-old to pay up - which she now insists she has.</p>
      <p>However, she claims online trolls branded her a "s***" following the case and publicity caused her major headaches.</p>
      <p>Now, she's put her side of the story across in a bid to set the record straight.</p>
      <p>Miss Wanless said: "I can't get a house due to the newspaper article.</p>
      <p>"I'm working in London then sofa surfing with friends when I'm back in Newcastle because nobody will rent to me.</p>
      <p>"People think that I'm going to rip them off but I've never done such a thing and I've never even lent any money off people before.</p>
      <p>"I've always had good credit, and if I was going to get a loan I'd go to a lender, not someone's family.</p>
      <p>"Now I'm struggling to find a house because they are bringing a CCJ (County Court Judgement) which is just a nightmare."</p>
      <p>Miss Wanless told the court the debt was between Donnis and her nephew, bouncer Andrew Flavell, for money borrowed to rent a flat in Tenerife.</p>
      <p>However, District Judge Michelle Temple ruled Miss Wanless was liable for the money which had been transferred to her account.</p>
      <p>Now, the former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/prudhoe">Prudhoe</a> Community High School pupil - who told September's hearing the cash was "nothing to do with her" - believes she was singled out due to her work.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a>-born model has posed for the Daily Sport and co-hosted the 2019 UK Glamour Awards. She also charges fans $20-a-month to see explicit content on an adult website.</p>
      <p>She added: "It was because of the work that I do, and I've been called a s*** and an escort, which isn't true.</p>
      <p>"[Models] get put in a bad light quite often because as it is classed as sex work, there is a stigma at goes with it.</p>
      <p>"But the girls support each other and we are nice. I've worked in bars, and that is a much nastier industry to be in."</p>
      <p>The case made headlines after Miss <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/babestation-model-tweets-i-need-16890603">Wanless tweeted 'I need a solisitor'</a> days before the last hearing.</p>
      <p>She now claims that tweet wasn't even for the case, but instead for help looking at legal documents - although she admits: "I'm not the best speller."</p>
      <p>Instead she claims she used her uncle - who was in the police - for the hearing although that backfired.</p>
      <p>"He thought because he's used to the criminal system he would be able to represent me," she said.</p>
      <p>However, the judge refused to let him hand in evidence and dismissed an appeal - due to Miss Wanless' absence from the first hearing due to being out of the country.</p>
      <p>She claims she's now repaid the cash - although she doesn't feel she shouldn't have had to pay back a penny.</p>
      <p>"I didn't find it fair the way that it turned out," she added.</p>
      <p>"I just wish that I'd known a solicitor and that I had been a bit more clued up. I wish I'd done my research."</p>
