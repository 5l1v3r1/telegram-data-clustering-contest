      <h1>Derek Stillie reveals death threats after THAT Rangers 6-1 defeat as he bids to become a Tory MP</h1>
      <h2>The former Aberdeen keeper has looked back on his football years as he aims for high office.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>One death wish is enough without a boy from Cumnock raised on the soundbites of Arthur Scargill signing up to become a Tory MP.</p>
      <p>As a prospective politician, Derek Stillie emits the same calm authority he brought to his game for more than two decades as a top flight number one.</p>
      <p>Henrik Larsson and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a> used to fire crosses into his box at Aberdeen, Dunfermline and Dundee United and now he’s dealing with verbal volleys from the voters of Central Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>Former Scotland under-21 keeper Stillie, now 45, forged a fine career with his hands but has always refused to twiddle his thumbs.</p>
      <p>After completing his Open University degree as a player he’s now a successful commercial lawyer in Ayr - he was consultant for top rated BBC Scotland drama ‘Guilt’ - and still coaches the keepers at Somerset Park.</p>
      <p>He became more politically motivated after returning to Scotland four years ago from London.</p>
      <p>Let’s just say bookies are offering better odds on him becoming an MP in next month’s general election than they ever did Dunfermline beating Rangers on the last day of the season in 2003.</p>

      <p>That 6-1 defeat still rankles, the macabre letter he received from a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fan in the aftermath adding a slice of black humour about which he can only now laugh, not least as the author included his address at the top of the Basildon Bond.</p>
      <p>If he can find another 1,300 votes to add to the Tory count from the last election in 2017 he’ll script a slice of political history on December 12 by unseating the SNP and adding another story to a life less ordinary.</p>
      <p>He said: “I come from Cumnock and we had the miners’ strike growing up so there was always an element of politics around the household and community.</p>
      <p>“Historically, Cumnock was a staunch Labour stronghold and I attended rallies at the time with speakers that included Arthur Scargill.</p>
      <p>“My grandfathers were miners, mum was an admin assistant in social work and dad was a brickie and post office worker. They both knew periods of unemployment.</p>
      <p>“I spent a lot of my adult life voting Labour. I left Scotland in 2007 but was aghast when I returned eight years later at how much the country had changed under the SNP administration.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We’ve become obsessed with this constitutional question to the detriment of education and health, in particular.</p>
      <p>“We need to return to priorities and that’s why I joined the Conservatives. Look, I know the legacy of Thatcher isn’t popular in the area, but that was 40 years ago. We’re a different animal across Scotland and the UK these days.”</p>
      <p>Stillie delivers his sermon over a cup of tea at Prestwick Airport, mingling with a handful of holidaymakers preparing to depart for the winter sun in Lanzarote.</p>
      <p>He played in a fine Aberdeen side, part of the League Cup winning squad of 1996, spent two years under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> at Tannadice and also reached the play-off finals twice with Wigan at Wembley.</p>
      <p>But he’s probably best remembered at the Pars and if sunseekers are heading for the Spanish isles, he could have been forgiven after that title shoot-out 16 years ago for buying a one way ticket to Timbuktu.</p>
      <p>He said: “To some extent we walked off at the end thinking, ‘I hope Celtic have beaten Kilmarnock more than they’ve beaten us so it’s not on our doorstep’.</p>
      <p>“We were devastated, embarrassed at losing 6-1. Rangers won the league. Who cared? It had nothing to do with us.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t believe there was any way Chris Sutton could have said we lay down to Rangers, but he did.</p>

      <p>“You could understand it to some extent, coming off at Rugby Park having lost the league by a goal and full of adrenaline. Credit him for later admitting he was out of order.</p>
      <p>“I’ve watched it back and I wouldn’t say I was at fault for any of the goals and I made a few decent saves after Jason Dair pulled it back to 1-1.</p>
      <p>“Actually, I had the biggest fall out I ever experienced after a football game that day, with Jimmy Nicholl.</p>
      <p>“Gus MacPherson kneed the ball back to me during the game and I picked the ball up in my box.</p>
      <p>“Stuart Dougal gave a free kick to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers </a>and in the last minute they got a penalty as well, which was also quite dubious.</p>
      <p>“Afterwards, Jimmy Nic asked why I picked it up instead of just booting it up the park and relieving the pressure, but it should not have been a free kick. Let’s just say the discussion between us was quite forceful.”</p>
      <p>The death letter, sent immediately after the game to East End Park, wasn’t seen until Stillie reported back for pre-season training.</p>
      <p>He added: “It was a genius death threat - his address was at the top of the page. I read it and put it in the bin and then thought again. I retrieved it, showed it to the manager, and took it to the police.</p>
      <p>“Actually, it was more of a death wish and how horrible a death he believed I should succumb to, hopefully sometime soon.</p>
      <p>“Listen, we maybe didn’t anticipate going to Ibrox that day and winning 3-0, but we expected a positive result to take us into the close season.”</p>
      <p>Stillie also had reason to curse Dougal in the 2004 Scottish Cup final when Bobo Balde handled a corner in the box, but the whistler waved away appeals and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/henrik-larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> went up the pitch and equalised before Celtic went on to win 3-1.</p>

      <p>He said: “It was blatant, but it takes a strong referee to point to the spot and put Dunfermline 2-0 up with half an hour to go.”</p>
      <p>However, his career is reviewed through a prism of pride, with Stillie a strong enough character to roll with the punches every time a team-mate saw him reading a book on political theory at the front of the bus.</p>
      <p>He added: “It was often, ‘Why are you reading that s****?’ but I couldn’t retire on my earnings from football. There wasn’t a stack of cash piling up.”</p>
      <p>Now the Puma Kings have been replaced by stout walking shoes as he hits the pavements around Irvine and Kilwinning, Prestwick, Troon and Tarbolton.</p>
      <p>He said: “Knocking doors is more frightening than football, but I’m getting a positive reception, which is delightful.”</p>
      <p>Mind you, it’s maybe just as well big Sutton lives in Lincolnshire...</p>
