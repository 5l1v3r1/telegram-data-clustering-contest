      <p>A riot police officer (name withheld) posted from  Asaba, Delta State, has died due to  gunshot wounds following a shooting at King Koko Square venue for  an aborted Peoples Democratic Party rally in Ogbolomabiri, Nembe Local Government Area of   Bayelsa State on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The police inspector was  said to have been hit by bullets after suspected PDP and the All Progressives Congress thugs reportedly engaged in a gunfight at  venue  for the rally.</p>
      <p>It was learnt that the body of the deceased officer had since been deposited at the Nembe General Hospital.</p>
      <p>His  colleague identified as Ododomu was lucky  as he survived the attack,  although  sustained a gunshot wound to the leg.</p>
      <p>Also, two other policemen are critically injured and are battling to survive, <i>Saturday PUNCH</i> learnt.</p>
      <p>There were indications on Friday that some  people were still missing, with unconfirmed reports  saying  thugs ripped open the stomachs of their victims and threw them into the  nearby river.</p>
      <p>A security source said  medical personnel had been battling to save the lives of the victims at the Specialist Hospital and Federal Medical Centre in  Yenagoa.</p>
      <p>The source said, “As of Friday, 39 of the wounded have been discharged.</p>
      <p>“Also, 47 are still on admission with 32 at the FMC and 15 still battling for their lives at  the Specialist Hospital.”</p>
