      <p>The Los Angeles auto show will take place from November 22 to December 1, 2019. We have compiled a list of cars that will be unveiled at the show.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles (LA) auto show is one of the last motor shows that take place in the calendar year and due to this it tends to attract some important announcements and unveils. This year, the LA auto show will open for press on November 18, and for the general public from November 22, up until December 1, 2019. Although there are a few manufacturers that will not be attending the show this year, there are still quite a few exciting cars slated to be unveiled. We have compiled a list of all the cars that will be present at the 2019 LA auto show below.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Audi</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>E-tron Sportback</b>

      <p>Shown in <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/pre-production-audi-e-tron-sportback-revealed-at-geneva-411792"><b>camouflaged prototype form at March’s Geneva auto show</b></a>, the rakishly styled Sportback variant of Audi’s E-tron electric SUV has since lost its disguise in the run-up to its LA reveal.</p>
      <p>The standard E-tron’s 408hp twin-motor powertrain is carried over unmodified, which means that the Sportback will be capable of 0-100kph in 5.5sec, have a range of around 400km and be fitted with 150kW rapid charging. Changes seem to be limited to the reshaped roofline and a subtly restyled rear end that includes an LED brake-light bar similar to that of the A8 luxury sedan.</p>

      <p>BMW recently <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/india-bound-bmw-2-series-gran-coup-revealed-414521"><b>revealed the 2 Series Gran Coupe</b></a>, which will be the largest model in the 2 Series range and be positioned below the 3 Series sedan in BMW’s global line-up. The model will make its public debut at the LA auto show this year. The four-door coupé is based on the same front-wheel-drive platform as the smaller 1 Series, and shares that model’s range of petrol and diesel engines. We had also previously reported that the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/scoop-bmw-2-series-gran-coupe-coming-2020-2021-413303"><b>BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe will make its way to the Indian market in 2020-21</b></a>. Once launched, the 2 Series Gran Coupe will rival the likes of the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/cla"><b>Mercedes-Benz CLA</b></a> and <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/audi/a3"><b>Audi A3</b></a> sedans in the Indian market.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/2020-bmw-m8-gran-coupe-revealed-414426"><b>BMW M8 Gran Coupe</b></a> is essentially a more performance-focused version of the 8 Series Gran Coupe. Going up against the Porsche Panamera, the new BMW is powered by the same 4.4-litre, twin-turbocharged V8 engine as the two-door models, with identical outputs – 600hp in the standard model and 625hp in Competition form. The German carmaker has yet to confirm whether or not it will bring the M8 Grand Coupe to our market; but the standard 8 Series Gran Coupe is expected to make its way to India by mid-2020.</p>

      <p>Ford’s first all-electric offering is going to be the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/the-mustang-mach-e-is-fords-new-electric-suv-414927"><b>Mustang Mach-E</b></a> e-SUV, which is set to be revealed on November 17, ahead of the LA auto show. The American carmaker is expected to showcase the electric SUV at the LA auto show as well. In the run-up to the model’s reveal, some images of the Mustang Mach-E had surfaced online, showcasing the interior and exterior design of the new electric SUV.</p>

In all likelihood, this concept will preview the design of the next-gen Tucson. Although the Korean carmaker has been very quiet regarding any details about the concept, it did release a teaser video that gave a glimpse of the model’s design. </p>

      <p>The standard GLS SUV’s silhouette will be retained, though according to spy shots, the Maybach version will feature bespoke design elements inspired by 2016’s <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/vision-mercedes-maybach-6-concept-revealed-402808"><b>Vision Mercedes Maybach 6 coupe concept</b></a>. There is also the possibility that the new top-of-the-line GLS could also offer improved rear legroom, courtesy of an extended wheelbase. Mercedes is expected to equip the Maybach GLS with a 4.0-litre, twin-turbocharged, V8 petrol engine.</p>

      <p>Mini's fastest model yet, the 304hp JCW GP, has been teetering on the edge of an unveil for a while, with prototypes making public appearances at high-profile events like the Nürburgring 24 Hours and Goodwood Festival of Speed. However, now the wraps are finally coming off. Mini has confirmed that the JCW GP will be capable of a sub-eight-minute Nordschleife lap time, but we'll have to wait to see just how Oxford's answer to the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/new-mercedes-amg-a-35-revealed-409749"><b>Mercedes-AMG A35</b></a> will differentiate itself style-wise from the standard <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2019-mini-john-cooper-works-review-track-drive-412669"><b>Cooper JCW</b></a>. It is worth noting that <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mini-john-cooper-works-launched-in-india-priced-at-rs-4350-lakh-412659"><b>Mini did launch the Cooper JCW in India</b></a> at Rs 43.50 lakh (ex-showroom).</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This will not be a new car, though exciting nonetheless, as Porsche is adding a 7-speed manual option to the latest generation of its much-loved <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/porsche-/911"><b>911</b></a> sportscar. The option is rolling out at no extra cost to US buyers; though there hasn’t been any announcement regarding the model’s India launch yet. It's likely that Porsche will show the manual version of the 911 in LA.</p>

      <p>Porsche <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/porsche-taycan-4s-ev-unveiled-414535"><b>revealed the new Taycan 4S</b></a>, which is now the entry point for the German carmaker’s electric sedan range. The 4S offers considerably less power than the top-run Turbo and Turbo S models, but it’s also much more affordable. The Taycan 4S’ range is a still-respectable 406km in standard guise, with an optional Performance Battery Plus pack, bringing that up to 462km. As we had previously reported, the Director of Porsche India, Pavan Shetty, announced that the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/all-electric-porsche-taycan-to-launch-in-india-in-2020-413645"><b>Taycan will go on sale in India in 2020</b></a>, though pricing was not revealed (expected price is around the Rs 2 crore mark). </p>

The model will offer more range, power and battery capacity than the existing self-charging hybrid, over which it is likely to command a small premium in the international markets. Toyota has made no announcement regarding its plans to bring the RAV4 SUV to the Indian market.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The new model will follow a wave of big-selling crossover and hatchback-style EVs from VW and its Skoda, Audi and Seat partner brands, as part of the company’s drive to produce 15 million MEB-based electric cars before 2028. Volkswagen will also be display four other MEB-based concepts alongside the new ID Space Vizzion concept at the 2019 LA auto show, which will likely be the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/new-volkswagen-id-crozz-concept-unveiled-at-frankfurt-405946"><b>ID Crozz</b></a> and <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/volkswagen-id-roomzz-concept-suv-revealed-at-2019-shanghai-motor-show-412340"><b>ID Roomzz</b></a> SUVs, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/vw8217s-microbus-inspired-id-buzz-to-launch-by-2022-405733"><b>ID Buzz Cargo van</b></a> and <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/volkswagen-id-buggy-concept-revealed-at-geneva-411784"><b>ID Buggy off-roader</b></a>.</p>
