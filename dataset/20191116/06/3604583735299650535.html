      <p>People have come out in droves to check out Ballarat's newest youth festival despite the chilly weather at Victoria Park.</p>
      <p>Hundreds funneled through the inaugural Spring In The Park festival on Saturday afternoon, taking in the activities, live music and food on offer.</p>
      <p>Organised by the Central Highlands <a href="https://www.highlandsllen.org/networks-events/youth-advisory-board/">Youth Advisory Board</a>, the free, all-ages event has been labelled a success by one of its organisers.</p>
      <p>YAB coordinator Pearl Goodwin-Burns said despite the cold conditions, she was very happy with the amount of people enjoying themselves at the festivals debut.</p>
      <p>"I'm stoked," she said.</p>
      <p>"I'm so impressed with Ballarat for getting out and supporting young people on a day that's not particularly warm."</p>
      <p>With a number of large festivals in the region unavailable for younger people for a numerous reasons, Ms Goodwin Burns believes having a free, all-ages event like Spring In The Park is important.</p>
      <p>"It's incredibly important to have free, family friendly community events, especially ones that are drug and alcohol free and all ages.</p>
      <p>"It makes it nice for those younger people who can't go to Spilt Milk or can't afford to go to a major festival to have something like this available."</p>
      <p>Ms Goodwin Burns added she was confident the festival would return in years to come.</p>
      <p>"I think given the success of today I think they'll be a strong chance that we'll be back next year... we've had so much support from our sponsors I think it's only going to get bigger and better."</p>
