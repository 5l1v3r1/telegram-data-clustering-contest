      <p>Mark Fynn had been jailed for 12 weeks in December last year after headbutting the victim while she was pregnant with their child and made the subject of a restraining order banning any contact with her for two years, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>The pair had been together since the April or May last year in a relationship that started off well but soon became violent, maintained Mr Nicholas Burn, prosecuting.</p>
      <p>The victim described how Fynn, who had a 2016 conviction for battery against another girlfriend, had tried to strangle her before the head butting incident after which she reported him to the police.</p>
      <p>The defendant sent her a stream of threatening text messages warning he would throw acid over her, "snap" her neck and "smash her head in," revealed Mr Burn.</p>
      <p>Mr Philip Brunt, defending, disclosed there had been a partial rekindling of the relationship despite the restraining order but it ended when the victim walked out on him for good on August 25 this year.</p>
      <p>Then Fynn sent more messages in which he admitted his behaviour had been "disgusting and unnecessary."</p>
      <p>He vowed: "I don't hate you and am not going to be nasty anymore."</p>
      <p>Mr Brunt said: "The communications were obvious breaches of the restraining order but there was nothing threatening in them this time. However he now accepts that the relationship is over."</p>
      <p>Fynn from Wolverhampton Street, Dudley admitted harassment and breaching the restraining order.</p>
      <p>He was jailed and given another order banning any contact with the victim for five years by Recorder Mark Brown who told him: "These were persistent breaches while you refused to accept this relationship was over."</p>
