      <h1>Incomes of social media influencers soar amid resctrictions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:07:02+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/6748/tech-desk/" target="_blank">Tech Desk</a></address>
      <p>Social media influencers have the ability to sell your product to a vast audience due to which they are charging a hefty price as well.</p>
      <p>Instagram recently banned sponsorship content for weight loss products as it has a negative impact on society. There were three influencers posts that had been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, labelling them ‘irresponsible’.</p>
      <p>However, there are numerous fashion and cosmetic brands that are willing to pay a good amount to generate popularity.</p>

      <p>According to the marketing firm <a href="https://izea.com/influencers-creators/"><i>Izea</i></a>, the price of a sponsored photo on Instagram has gone from $134 in 2014 to $1,642 in 2019.</p>
      <p>The report further stated that sponsored Instagram photo price has risen 44 per cent from 2018 to 2019. A sponsored blog post would make around $7.39 in 2006 spiked high to $1,442 in 2019.</p>
      <p>YouTube content creators benefited the most from this marketplace with a sponsored content price of $420 in 2014 to $6,700 in 2019 while Twitter posts have risen from $29 in 2014 to $422 in 2019 and single Facebook status update has risen from $8 in 2014 to $395 in 2019.</p>
      <p>“Digital marketing is the equivalent of word of mouth but there will always be a mix between that and traditional advertising,” said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, chief executive of social media marketing platform Socialbakers.</p>
      <p>Recently, Instagram also experimented hiding “likes” on posts but Itzhak thinks influencers will not be impacted at all.</p>
      <p>“Influencers will still be able to see what engagement they have and it is common practice to grant permission to brands so that they can see that too,” stated Itzhak.</p>

      <p>However, watchdogs haven’t turned a blind eye to this, there are tougher laws and regulations placed on social media platforms.</p>
      <p>Competition and Markets Authority has issued warning that influencers would be breaking consumer law if they do not make it clear when they advertise a product or brand.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the research suggests that influencer-sponsored posts spiked by 150 per cent in the last year, with double the use of the hashtag #ad.</p>
      <p>Brands are willing to increase their spending on influencer marketing in 2020, making it a $10 billion industry.</p>
