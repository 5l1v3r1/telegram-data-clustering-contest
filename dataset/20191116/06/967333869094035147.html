        <b>Prince Andrew said in a new interview that “I kick myself […]  on a daily basis” over the friendship he had with the convicted pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, yet he doesn’t remember meeting the “sex slave” he’s accused of bedding.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Duke of York spoke for the first time about the scandal in a “no holds barred” BBC  interview that’s set to air Saturday – the member of British royal family was accused of having sex with Virginia Roberts Giuffre three times.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” said Prince Andrew, 59,  according to quotes from the interview.</blockquote>
      <p>The brief excerpts of the interview make no mention of a photo from the time period, which has been at the center of the controversy, which apparently shows Prince Andrew with his arm around a then-17-year-old Giuffre’s waist, with Ghislaine Maxwell – the owner of the house in Belgravia where the alleged sexual contact took place – in the background.</p>
      <p>Asked why he continued his<a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911151077317397-britain-prince-andrew-epstein-interview/"> friendship with Epstein</a>, including visiting him even after his 2008 conviction for procuring an underage girl for prostitution— the duke tried to show some regret.</p>
      <blockquote>“I stayed with him and that’s… I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that,” he said.</blockquote>
      <p>In court papers, Giuffre said she had sex with Prince Andrew three times — including when she was 17 — between 1999 and 2002. She claims they slept together at the London townhouse of Maxwell, who was also Epstein’s friend, after a night of clubbing, at Epstein’s New York home and at an orgy party on his private Caribbean island. In August, Buckingham Palace released a statement defending Prince Andrew and denying any wrongdoing.</p>
