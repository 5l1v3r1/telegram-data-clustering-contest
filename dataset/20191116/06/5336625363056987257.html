      <h1>These Beats wireless headphones are seriously cheap on Amazon</h1>

      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> The stylish <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdib">Beats Studio3</a> wireless headphones are on sale for £199 on Amazon, saving you 34% on list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>This one might be hard to believe, because it really seems like the sort of deal you would expect to see over the Black Friday weekend, but you can now save over £100 on the Beats Studio3 headphones on Amazon.</p>
      <p>We still have plenty of time before Black Friday officially kicks off, but it looks like this deal has slipped through the cracks. The <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdib">Beats Studio3</a> headphones are usually listed at £299.95, but you can now pick up a set for just £199, in three colours.</p>
      <p>These stylish headphones come packed with adaptive noise cancelling technology that actively blocks external noise, real-time audio calibration that preserves a premium listening experience, and up to 22 hours of battery life. They look great, but there's a lot more going on underneath the surface.</p>
      <p>The price could drop further during Amazon's <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/shopping/black-friday-cyber-monday-deal-guide-uk">Black Friday</a> sale, but we would be extremely surprised. It's rare to see significant discounts on Apple products, so a drop of more than £100 is pretty special.</p>
      <p>Start your weekend in the best possible way with a saving on these <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdib">Beats Studio3</a> wireless headphones.</p>
