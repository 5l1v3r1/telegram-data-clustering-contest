      <h2>SAM JOHNSTONE has challenged Albion to start keeping clean sheets at home.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>The goalkeeper has registered three consecutive shut-outs on the road with the Baggies winning at Middlesbrough, Stoke and Hull.</p>
      <p>In total, Slaven Bilic’s side have conceded just five goals in nine Championship outings away from The Hawthorns this season.</p>
      <p>But they have conceded 12 in seven appearances at home. And Johnstone says they need to tighten up in front of their own supporters.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been picking up some great results away from home and our confidence is really high as you’d probably expect,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But we want to start adding clean sheets at home now as well. We haven’t had one yet and we’re determined to start keeping teams out at The Hawthorns.”</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old added: “It’s so important, not just for goalkeepers, but for the whole team to be keeping teams out. It goes a long way to securing important results and victories.</p>
      <p>“We drew our last two home games against Charlton and Barnsley so we want to get back to winning ways in front of our own fans.</p>
      <p>Johnstone has been key to Albion’s impressive defensive displays with the glovesman making a string of fine saves.</p>
      <p>But he says to keep clean sheets everyone has to play well.</p>
      <p>“Goalkeepers will always get the most credit when a team keeps a clean sheet because they are the ones who are paid to keep the ball out,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“However, if you keep a clean sheet it normally means the whole team has defended really well and kept a solid shape. So I really do think that it’s a collective achievement.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got great defenders ahead of me who are always blocking shots and making it difficult for strikers to get opportunities.</p>
      <p>“The midfielders work really hard and it’s down to the front man to either press or hold a shape so everyone has a part to play.</p>
      <p>“There have been some games where I haven’t had too much to do in terms of saving shots which shows just how well the whole team is defending.”</p>
