      <h1>How Barbados lad arrived in UK with nothing but a dream to achieve his life's ambition</h1>
      <h2>Joel Manning arrived at the University of Sunderland armed only with a dream after leaving Barbados to become a sports journalist</h2>

      <p>After nine hours and almost 7,000 miles, Joel Manning arrived in the region armed only with a dream.</p>
      <p>He had left behind his mum and brother at the family’s home in Saint Michael, Barbados, to take the next step towards achieving his life’s ambition.</p>
      <p>Joel, 27, has been playing cricket since he was a schoolboy and his passion for the game has led him to arrive on Wearside to take up an MA in Sports Journalism at the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">University of  Sunderland.</a></p>
      <p>Up until a few months ago, Joel had been working and living in Barbados and had never even heard of the University of Sunderland.</p>

      <p>A popular public speaker and event host, he had long wanted to break into the field of TV sports presenting, although opportunities in his hometown were limited.</p>
      <p>Joel said: “I got invited to go to Jamaica to do a screen test for a sports presenter TV role. Although I made the shortlist, I didn’t get the job.</p>
      <p>“But somebody saw my audition and gave me a lot of positive feedback suggesting I should study sports journalism in the UK.”</p>
      <p>So Joel did his research and saw the exciting sports programme offered by the University. He arrived in September and admits the temperature has taken some getting used to.</p>

      <p>“I came here not knowing anyone but I’ve made friends,” he says. “I did bring a coat but quickly realised it’s not going to be enough to get through the winter.”</p>
      <p>But Joel remains completely focused on his career goals.</p>

      <p>He said: “My mind just thinks massive all the time. I want to get out there and work on a global scale. Ideally I’d like to get into the cricket presenting side of things, but I’m happy to do any sports.</p>
      <p>“I grew up watching and playing cricket. I actually support India which I get a lot of grief for, being from the West Indies. Although I do whole heartedly want to see them do well too.</p>

      <p>“I spent a lot of time working for myself as a speaker, host, and MC. I did a lot of speaking at schools and universities around issues of personal branding and building confidence.”</p>
      <p>Once he finishes his year in Sunderland, Joel is hoping to have built up his sports contacts and secured work in the TV presenting field.</p>
      <p>After being in Sunderland for two months he admits to missing home but is determined to become a success here.</p>
      <p>“Of course I miss my mum and brother,” Joel says. “I especially miss my mum’s cooking. I have been trying to make a few Caribbean dishes since I’ve been here.”</p>
