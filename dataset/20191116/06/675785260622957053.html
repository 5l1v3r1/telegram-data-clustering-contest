      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:24:39+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:24</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Will.i.am has accused an airline attendant of 'racism' after a row on a flight escalated to the point that police met the music producer when the plane touched down.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old US rapper is on tour in Australia and was heading to Sydney from Brisbane on a Qantas flight.</p>
      <p>He revealed on Twitter details of a situation that developed while they were in the air.</p>
      <p>Will.i.am claimed that he had been subjected to 'racism' by a particular flight attendant and that a misunderstanding had escalated due to the colour of his skin.</p>
      <p>The airline said it "completely rejects" the performer's claims of racism.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media about his plight, will.i.am told his 12.8milion followers: "I’m currently on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I’m sorry to say me and my group have experienced they worse service due to a overly aggressive flight attendant... I don’t want to believe she racist.</p>
      <p>"But she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour."</p>
      <p>He then went on to claim that because he had "noise cancelling headphones" on, he was singled out and the police were called to meet the flight when it landed in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Tweeting in anger about his 'welcoming committee', the Voice coach sparked a furore by naming the Qantas emplyee.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: " This is how your greeted when you land from Brisbane to Sydney flying @qantas with a #RacistFlightattendant... ...[They] sent the police after me bacause I couldn’t hear the P.A while making beats on the plane wearing noise canceling headphones."</p>
      <p>He continued branded the airline's staff as "beyond rude", continuing: "@Qantas Your #RacistFlightattendant was beyond rude &amp; took it to the next level by calling the police on me. thank god the other passengers testified that SHE was out of Control the police finally let me go. imagine if the police were as aggressive as [your flight attendant]."</p>

      <p>When challenged on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> as to why he thought it was targeted harassment, the music producer replied: "I’m sorry? Is callin the police on a passenger for not hearing he P.A due to wearing noise canceling headphones appropriate? If didn’t put away my laptop 'in a rapid 2min time' I’d understand. I did comply quickly &amp; politely, only to be greeted by police. I think I was targeted."</p>

      <p>Social media started to turn on the singer, with some saying that he shouldn't have called out the flight attendant as they were being subjected to hateful trolling online.</p>
      <p>will.i.am hit back: "I was intimidated by 5 police officers when I landed...for what? I put away my laptop when she asked...why would she feel threatened by me to call the police?</p>
      <p>"What did I do wrong? I wasn’t out of hand.. I was polite &amp; did what she asked... now you’re asking me to take abuse?"</p>
      <p>After being challenged as to why he was using "star power" to have action taken by the airline. will.i.am denied this and said that his tweets were a "proper complaint" against Qantas.</p>

      <p>He continued: "This is me filing a 'proper complaint'...this way I know my complaint &amp; treatment will be heard...I’m using the same tool you would use if you were wrongly accused of doing something &amp; pulled away by police officers. I still don’t know what I did wrong for police to come.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://twitter.com/Qantas">@Qantas</a> every passenger &amp; race should be greeted with a smile &amp; treated with respect. There was so much tension on the flight I didn’t want [her] to serve me food cuz I didn’t want to add to her stress. I thought I was doing the right thing by escaping to music <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wheresthelove?src=hashtag_click">#wheresthelove</a>.</p>
      <p>"I am posting so that this doesn’t happen again...it shouldn’t happen to a Aboriginal, Latino, African, LGBTQ White, Red or anyone... everyone deserves to be treated with respect..."</p>
      <p>When some of Will's fans started targeting the attendant with abuse, the musician begged for them to stop.</p>

      <p>"Please do not send Hate...This type of disrespect and name calling is uncalled for...I don’t support abuse &amp; attacks like this...I hope that everyone can be more compassionate &amp; understanding towards one another...because it was the lack of compassion that caused this <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/noH8?src=hashtag_click">#noH8</a>," he wrote.</p>
      <p>A little later, he went on: "Twitter is the people’s tool...rich and poor...a tool to use when things go wrong...it allows people can FEEL directly from the people that have FEELINGS...today I FELT discrimination...and I spoke for all the other people who are voiceless."</p>
      <p>He came under fire again for naming the attendant, but hit back to insist there is nothing wrong with public shaming.</p>
      <p>"If I did something wrong....or if I was the slightest bit rude to a FAN or a journalist during work, I would be publicly named...this is what Twitter is for...we are supposed to call out wrong doings so we can have a safer more compassionate world," he added.</p>
      <p>In a statement to Mirror Online, a spokesperson for Qantas said: "There was a misunderstanding on board, which seems to have been exacerbated by will.i.am wearing noise-cancelling headphones and not being able to hear instructions from crew.</p>
      <p>"We completely reject the suggestion this had anything to do with race.</p>
      <p>"We’ll be following up with will.i.am and wish him well for the rest of the tour."</p>
