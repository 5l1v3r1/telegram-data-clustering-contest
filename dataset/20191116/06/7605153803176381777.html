        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 16 – Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has called on security agencies to step in and resolve recurrent border hostilities between communities in Tana River and the neighboring Garissa and Kitui counties.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking at a press conference in Nairobi on Friday, he maintained that cultural ties between the Tana and Somali communities had existed for generations and there was no need for animosity.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Tension has been building up along the Tana River and Garissa border with both parties claiming and developing infrastructure on disputed land.</p>
      <p>Inflammatory statements by leaders in both counties have also been blamed for widening rifts in the region with several meetings between rival groups bearing no fruits.</p>
      <p>“The relationship between the people of Tana and the Somali community of Garissa has been there for ages. It started many years ago. People have intermarried and are related. This relationship can only be enhanced today and cannot be wished away. We have reported the matter to the internal security ministry, National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and security agencies so that we can find a solution to this problem,” Governor Godhana said.</p>
      <p>There has been loss of life and property along the Kitui and Tana River county boundary with hundreds of people fleeing their homes following perennial clashes between Kitui farmers and Tana herders over land and pasture.</p>
      <p>Following drought in the region and lack of pasture for livestock, the Kamba community in Kitui County has accused Somali herders from Tana River of forcefully grazing their animals on their farms. This has led to retaliatory attacks that have raised tension among the residents.</p>
      <p>“We have been able to reach out to Governor Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and we have agreed that we will go to the affected area together to find a solution. We want a grassroots solution that can be prepared by the council of elders. I believe it is possible to end this conflict,” Godhana said.</p>
      <p>Tana River currently has border disputes with Kitui, Garissa, Lamu and Kilifi counties.</p>
