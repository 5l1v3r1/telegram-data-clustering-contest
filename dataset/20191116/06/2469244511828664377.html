      <p>It's safe to say dangerous reptiles are not everybody's idea of fun. Even a terrified Indiana Jones once exclaimed: 'Why did it have to be snakes?'</p>
      <p>But for one Torquay man caring for these magnificent creatures has been the basis of his life's work.</p>
      <p>Ever since he caught his first snake at the age of five Sean Nichol knew he was destined to work with reptiles.</p>
      <p>Originally born in Bradford, and now settled in Torquay, Sean emigrated to Canada with his parents when he was a small boy.</p>
      <p>The move set Sean on a path to becoming an expert in reptiles, rescuing man-eating snakes and working with world renowned 'crocodile hunter' Steve Irwin.</p>

      <p>Remembering his first encounter with a snake in Canada, Sean said: "I saw something move and was drawn to it right away and my dad was like: 'Put that down!' I had no idea whether it was venomous or not- I could have been killed."</p>
      <p>But the young Sean was captivated by the creatures, spending his time in the library researching reptiles, determined to find out more about them.</p>
      <p>He said: "In my summer holidays my mission was to find all the snakes. To me that was like a kid playing an Xbox today. It snowed-balled from there.</p>
      <p>"I would bring in snakes for show and tell at six or seven years old. Girls would be like 'Gross, how can you play with those things?"</p>

      <p>Sean paid tribute to his school science teacher, Mr Lowry, who he said actively encouraged his interest in the animals. Sean said: "I think he knew one day I'd be doing this."</p>
      <p>As a child Sean begged his parents for a pet snake for Christmas. He wasn't interested it what else Santa might have brought him, he said: "I didn't care what was under the tree, I didn't care - I didn't get a snake."</p>
      <p>When Sean's dad finally decided a snake could join the family Sean was one step ahead: "It's OK Dad, I've already had two for about a year and a half."</p>
      <p>Sean's vast knowledge of reptiles is completely self-taught, although he said he had an advantage as his mother was a vet. His expertise has seen him coming to the rescue in some incredibly dangerous situations.</p>

      <p>On one occasion, Sean received an emergency phone call from the Canadian police requesting his help with a lethal snake.</p>
      <p>Sean remembered: "They said, 'There's a massive snake, it's killed the person - it's an 18ft Burmese python."</p>
      <p>He rushed to the property and soon realised that the snake must have tragically mistaken the man for one of the household's pet cats.</p>
      <p>Sean said: "I caught it and took it home. It wasn't nasty but they smell food.</p>
      <p>"I was helping. I knew I could catch it no problem. I walked out with this snake around my neck."Â </p>
      <p>Sean's love of reptiles has also seen him rub shoulders with wildlife royalty.</p>
      <p>He remembered fondly an expedition to Central America with Australian zoo-keeper and TV personality Steve Irwin - who sadly died in September 2006.</p>
      <p>Sean said: "Before Steve had The Crocodile Hunter [TV show] we met. He had the same mullet as me - we just hit it off right away."</p>

      <p>The two went exploring in search of deadly boa constrictors.</p>
      <p>Sean said: "I remember Steve had a broom handle with a camera on it, that's how he started filming. He was just so enthusiastic and passionate, his face would light up-he'd be like, 'Grab that Seany Boy!"</p>
      <p>Sean enjoyed his time in Central America so much that he ended up cancelling his flights home and staying for three months: "The locals thought we were mad."</p>
      <p>The fifty-one year old may now be living in the much tamer county of Devon but Sean remains passionate about reptile welfare and education.</p>
      <p>He has a whole building underneath his house dedicated to their care.</p>

      <p>He said: "It's kind of like the Bat Cave - where you pull into the garage and the house is above it."</p>
      <p>The building is home to close to 1000 reptiles, along with frogs and tarantulas.</p>
      <p>Sean no longer keeps large animals, he said some of the photos of the large snakes are of animals he's helped rescue. However, he said: "I've got some stuff you wouldn't want to get bit by, definitely."</p>
      <p>He stressed that there are strict rules and inspections involved in keeping creatures like his, and that the animal's welfare is paramount.</p>
      <p>All of Sean's creatures have been checked and he said they passed the inspections with 'flying colours.' He spends many hours every day attending to them, helped by two or three volunteers.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Through his community interest company For Goodness Snakes, Sean takes some of his animals out into the community to help educate others about their care.</p>
      <p>Sean said: "It's education for the nation. A lot of care homes and special needs people really benefit-we go to them. They really absorb the information.</p>
      <p>"Every single show we do we strongly emphasise: 'Don't go out and buy a snake.'</p>
      <p>"If you do decide you're going to buy a snake please do as much research as you can."</p>
      <p>Sean warned against relying simply on the Internet to research potential pets and said he's happy for anybody to get in touch with him for advice.</p>

      <p>In the future, Sean dreams of opening a farm just for reptiles, but said he can't see that happening without a lottery win.</p>
      <p>For the time being, he's delighted to be sharing his love of reptiles with others in the community.</p>
      <p>He's also hoping to bring about change in his local community by organising a Christmas food and toy collection so that every child can enjoy Christmas this year.</p>
