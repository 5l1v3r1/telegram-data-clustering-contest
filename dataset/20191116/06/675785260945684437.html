      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: "(There will be a) grey start to Saturday for many with further showers.</p>
      <p>"Some brightness first thing along with the frost and some fog patches but for the rest of Scotland lots of cloud cover particularly across eastern and southern Scotland and some showers.</p>
      <p>"Cloud for northern England, into much of Wales and here again there will be showers especially near coastal areas."</p>
