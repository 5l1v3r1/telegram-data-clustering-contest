      <h1>Ryan Christie raves about Scotland boss Steve Clarke as he hails 'positivity' in the camp</h1>
      <h2>The Celtic midfielder thinks Scotland are going places under the former Kilmarnock boss.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Christie scanned his living room in Inverness and could sense the overwhelming feeling of sadness.</p>
      <p>Scotland had agonisingly crashed out of yet another qualifying campaign for a major tournament.</p>
      <p>This time it was Euro 2008. Italy had ended our hopes with a late Christian Panucci header at Hampden.</p>
      <p>Christie didn’t quite grasp why everyone at the house party – which his parents hosted for international games – was so dejected. But he could feel it. And it’s stuck with him to this day.</p>
      <p>Scotland still haven’t made it to a World Cup or Euro Championships. But at least now he can do something about it. These next two games against Cyprus today and Kazakhstan on Tuesday night might be dead rubbers.</p>
      <p>But they will prepare <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a>’s squad for a mouthwatering Nations League semi-final in March that could lead to Euro 2020. And Christie, a patriotic Highlander, wants to be there more than anyone.</p>

      <p>The midfielder has experienced success with Celtic, domestically and now in Europe. But he’s adamant the feeling of satisfaction and pride that he’s felt lifting silverware at Parkhead – will be multiplied if he can make history with his country.</p>
      <p>As far as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-christie">Christie</a>’s concerned, there shouldn’t be doom and gloom around Clarke’s camp.</p>
      <p>Irrespective of what’s happened before, they have a golden opportunity in March to get Scotland’s self-respect back.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the match with Cyprus in Nicosia, the 24-year-old said: “I’m excited about the play-offs. They’ll come around very quickly and people will recognise what a massive opportunity it is.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The players know that already, that’s why we want to do well in these games to prepare for it. When they come around, it’ll be very exciting. There will be a real buzz about them.</p>
      <p>“It probably feels more real now. And the buzz that will come with the play-off games will just add to everyone’s performance.</p>
      <p>“We’re all desperate to be the team that makes history and get to a major tournament. I’m not dreaming of the Euros yet. But when the play-offs come around, it will be a major driving force.</p>
      <p>“When you win big tournaments at club level, you get that feeling of pride. But that’ll be times 100 if we can do it with our country.</p>
      <p>“Sadly I’m too young to remember the really good games Scotland were involved in. I do remember the night James McFadden scored in France. But I also remember the Italy game in 2007, which wasn’t quite so good.</p>

      <p>“I was really young at the time and I didn’t quite understand it back then. But you could feel the air of sadness in the room. So I have been around it long enough to know how the Scotland fans have felt. And I know what it would mean to them to qualify.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen all the footage from France 98 with the game against Brazil and the players wearing kilts. I actually watched a YouTube documentary about it recently and it was really interesting. To be there next summer would be an incredible experience. To qualify and then play a match on home soil at Hampden would be unbelievable.”</p>
      <p>Christie is part of a talented group of players who haven’t yet gelled together to make Scotland a force again. He feels it’s coming under Clarke. And he accepts a glut of call-offs – which sees the coach without the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a>, Scott McTominay and Ryan Fraser – hasn’t helped.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But he’s convinced we’re on the right track. And in a warning to the absentees who aren’t in Cyprus, Christie says if they win both games, the players with the jerseys will expect to keep them.</p>
      <p>He said: “If we do well in and manage to win both we’ll be in pole position to keep the shirts for the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“Everyone who plays against Cyprus and Kazakhstan are desperate to impress the manager and keep their place going into two massive games in March. A lot of people are saying these games are meaningless but for us as players it’s the polar opposite.</p>
      <p>“We’re fighting for our place to play in these big games. I think we’re building something. Since I came in under the gaffer he’s been brilliant. I’ve felt a real positive vibrancy about it.</p>

      <p>“Even though there have been a few pull-outs at every camp, we’ve managed to keep a good core of players. We just have to find a level of performance for 90 minutes we know we’re capable of.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully these two games will be perfect to do that. We know the talent we’ve got in the squad. If we can come together as an 11 we will be a very good side. That’s what we aim to do.”</p>
      <p>If that gets them to the Euros the impact would have a seismic impact on the country. But Christie insists that would be payback for the Tartan Army.</p>
      <p>He said: “Getting to the finals would be huge psychologically for the country. It would give our group of players a big boost. Playing in a tournament for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> is something all the boys want to do in their careers.</p>
      <p>“And moving on from that, it would give us a great base to build from. We owe it to ourselves and our fans. We know how proud they would be if we do well in March.</p>
      <p>“That spurs us on. We know how much it means to the whole country.”</p>
