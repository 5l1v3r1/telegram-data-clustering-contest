      <p>The Pokémon Company will be hosting the very first <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b> online competition next month, on 6th December. If you would like to participate in the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/pokemon_sword_and_shield_will_host_its_first_online_battle_competition_this_december">Galar Beginnings tournament</a>, all you have to do is sign up between now (15th November) and 5th December to take part.</p>
      <p>To do this, you'll need to enter the VS menu within your copy of Sword or Shield and select Battle Stadium. From here, you select Online Competitions and select "Search Official Competitions" to enter. Entry into the competition is not allowed once the event has begun, so be sure to sign up while you still can.</p>
      <p>The competition itself will run from 6th December until 8th December and will allow you to make your Pokémon huge by Dynamaxing them—or even have their form change by Gigantamaxing them. These effects will last for three turns per battle. Below are some additional details:</p>
