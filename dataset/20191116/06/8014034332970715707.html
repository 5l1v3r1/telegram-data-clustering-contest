      <p>QUETTA, Pakistan — A Pakistani provincial government minister says a roadside bomb has killed three paramilitary troops and wounded five in the country’s southwest overnight.</p>
      <p>Zia Lango, home minister for Baluchistan province, says a remote-controlled bomb was placed in a motorcycle parked in the town of Kuchlak, a suburb of the provincial capital Quetta.</p>
      <p>He told reporters early Saturday that the blast targeted a paramilitary Frontier Corps vehicle.</p>
      <p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for Friday’s attack.</p>
      <p>Baluchistan has long been the scene of a low-level insurgency by armed groups demanding more autonomy and a greater share in the region’s gas and mineral resources. Islamist militants also operate in the region.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 30, a suicide bomber rammed his motorcycle into a police vehicle, killing one policeman in the town of Loralai in Balochistan.</p>
