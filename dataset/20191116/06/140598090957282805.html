      <h1>Take a leaf from Catherine Phipps's marvelous new book, and make winter leaves the star of your supper</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T06:01:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 06:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/catherine-phipps/" target="_blank">Catherine Phipps</a></address>
      <p>They are a disparate lot, leaves; just in terms of flavour, the choice is immense, something to suit every mood or craving. Consider the bitterness of endives; the pungency of wild garlic, mustard and curry leaf; icy, spicy menthol from mint. I could go on and on, and this is before I even start thinking about how much we can change all these flavours, through cooking, fermenting and pairing. Visually and texturally, leaves are a riot – the palest shades of white and yellow; every possible shade of green; they can be burnished browns, purples, reds.</p>
      <p>They can be crisp and tightly furled torpedoes or bullets (think endives and Brussels sprouts), crinkly and curly (kale, cavolo nero, savoy cabbage), or delicate and feathery. It is no wonder that they all cook very differently, too.</p>
      <p>We are most used to eating them as side dishes, within salads and soups, or as a flourish of green to add to stews, potages and curries. But there is so much value in making them the main part of the meal – roasted or grilled heads of leaves can be as satisfying as a steak, in part because they still have a tough resistance at their core.</p>
      <p>I don’t mean that we should all immediately become vegetarian or vegan, but what I do like doing is using meat, fish and dairy as a flavour accent to the vegetables, rather than the other way around.</p>

      <p>This is the top of the dense, woody stalk of Brussels sprouts, where the stem, still dotted with tiny nuggets of nutty-flavoured sprouts, broadens into a perfect head of tightly furled leaves surrounded by a loose crown of floppy green leaves.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Nick off the sprouts with a sharp knife and pull off all of the looser leaves. Discard the woodiest part of the stem, then cut the head into wedges. To cook, put a large slice of butter in a pan with a splash of water.</li>
        <li>When the butter has melted, add everything together and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Toss gently, then tightly cover and leave for around 10 to 12 minutes over a gentle heat, checking regularly.</li>
        <li>When you can easily pierce the sprouts with a knife tip, they are done. Serve immediately with the buttery juices.</li>
      </ol>
