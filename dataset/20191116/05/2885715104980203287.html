      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:36:21+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Goa’s Director General of Police Pranab Nanda died of a cardiac arrest late on Friday night. The 1988-batch IPS officer was in Delhi at the time of his death.</p>
      <p>Confirming Nanda’s demise, Inspector General of Police Jaspal Singh said, “We were informed by his family that Nanda is no more. He died due to cardiac arrest. It’s shocking.” The state police were officially informed at 1 am by Nanda’s wife Sundari.</p>
      <p>According to Singh, DGP Nanda had left for Delhi in the evening after attending two important sessions — he met the chief secretary to discuss the crimes in the state and chaired a meeting on the meritorious medals to be given to officers of the state cadre.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old was transferred to Goa on February 25 this year. He had previously held positions in MHA and was known to be a dynamic leader. In Goa, he kept very few public interactions and was known as a “tough taskmaster”.</p>
      <p>Expressing grief over the death of Nanda, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant tweeted, “Shocked and saddened by the untimely demise of Shri Pranab Nanda (IPS), DGP, Goa. My deepest sympathies to his family members. May God comfort them in this hour of grief.”</p>
      <p>Leader of Opposition in the Goa Assembly Digambar Kamat said, “My condolences to his wife IPS Sundari Nanda who served as deputy inspector general of police in Goa during my tenure as chief minister. My thoughts are with his family during this time of grief.”</p>
      <p>“He was a very welfare-oriented officer and soon after he took over most of the important meetings were towards that direction. He was also pursuing the files on promotions of the cadre and the administration. It’s very rare when you have an officer who is not just task-oriented but also welfare-oriented,” IPS officer Jaspal Singh added.</p>
