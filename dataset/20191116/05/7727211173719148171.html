      <h2>Phil Kirkbride's Royal Blue column reflects on the current state of play for Everton talent Kieran Dowell at loan club Derby County</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/phil-kirkbride/" target="_blank">Phil Kirkbride</a></address>
      <p>Kieran Dowell knows a lot can happen in six weeks.</p>
      <p>Derby County have nine games to play between now and January with injuries, suspensions and losses of form all possible and all presenting him with a chance.</p>
      <p>A chance he sorely needs.</p>
      <p>Because having sealed what looked to be an ideal loan move to Pride Park, Dowell is facing up to the distinct possibility of being sat on the bench when the Championship resumes next weekend.</p>
      <p>For the 10th time too and, if the other nine times are anything to go by, then he won't even make it off the bench.</p>
      <p>What on earth is going on?</p>
      <p>In July, Derby's new manager Phillip Cocu was pushing hard to take Dowell on loan from Everton and though his long-standing relationship with Marcel Brands helped, the young playmaker was already someone he knew all about.</p>
      <p>The Rams won the race, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/evertons-kieran-dowell-attracting-interested-16352615">ahead of Huddersfield Town and others</a>, to snap up a player who had already proven his Championship credentials at Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>A technical young player, a Dutch coach with a clear idea about the way the game should be played and a club that had shown itself ready to offer a platform for others like Dowell - what was not to like about this loan?</p>
      <p>Derby, under Frank Lampard, had taken Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Harry Wilson on season-long loans.</p>
      <p>Respectively, they made 44, 55 and 49 appearances for Derby in all competitions last season, en route to the play-off final, and are now playing, regularly, in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>This had been the hope for Dowell but the 22-year-old has played in less than half of their Championship games this term (seven) and, on Wednesday night, was given minutes in their under-23s Premier League Cup game with Leeds United.</p>

      <p>They won 7-1.</p>
      <p>But a second competitive outing since the end of August - at a level he thought he'd seen the back of - was no reason to celebrate for the Everton Academy graduate who will be, understandably, frustrated and confused by his situation.</p>
      <p>That he hasn't even been brought off the bench in any of the last nine league games will be frustrating Dowell further.</p>
      <p>Cocu will have his reasons but he cannot even get on the pitch to stake a claim, right now.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the season, the Derby boss said the loanee “can do better” and Dowell would soon lose his place.</p>
      <p>After his most recent appearance, against Hull at the end of October, he “did well” but Dowell hasn't been seen since and muddying the waters even further, in six weeks' time, there will be the arrival of Wayne Rooney as the club's new player-coach.</p>
      <p>There's no better attacker to learn from but, at that level, there is no stiffer competition for Dowell's place in the team.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> understands that Dowell is keen to see how the land lies over the course of the next few weeks and then assess if his prospects have improved but, right now, he's behind Duane Holmes and the on-loan Jamie Paterson for the No10 shirt in Cocu's 4-2-3-1 system. </p>
      <p>And, quite possibly, Rooney too.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear at this stage if there is a clause in Dowell's loan agreement that allows <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> to recall him but <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/details-joao-virginia-loan-spell-17258003">given one exists in goalkeeper Joao Virginia's contract at Reading</a>, it would appear likely.</p>
      <p>Because if his situation does not improve then he needs to get out of the deal.</p>
      <p>Forty-three appearances on loan at Nottingham Forest helped secure him a place in the first-team squad as Marco Silva arrived at Goodison but with chances thin on the ground, a half-season spell at Sheffield United was arranged.</p>
      <p>Dowell played 17 times as the Blades won promotion and it ensured his stock remained high but things have stalled at Derby.</p>
      <p>He would require another loan, the fourth of his <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> career, in January should he and the club look at a recall and, on the back of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chief-european-scout-promotes-players-17263069">comments from chief European scout Gretar Steinsson</a> yesterday, would a foreign move be an option?</p>
      <p>Dowell's good friend Jonjoe Kenny is loving every minute of his time with Schalke while Ademola Lookman enjoyed the Bundesliga so much he didn't want to leave.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it's what the Ormskirk-born player needs. That's, of course, if his situation at Derby doesn't improve.</p>
      <p>Let's see what the next six weeks bring.</p>
