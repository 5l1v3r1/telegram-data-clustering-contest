      <h1>‘He is frustrated’: Zouma sends message to Chelsea FC fans about striker</h1>
      <h2>Kurt Zouma opens up on Olivier Giroud's situation at Chelsea FC this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">The Sport Review staff</a></address>
      <h3>Kurt Zouma has revealed that Olivier Giroud is feeling frustrated at Chelsea FC due to his lack of playing time this season.</h3>
      <p>The France international has struggled to hold down a regular spot in the first team at Stamford Bridge this season since Frank Lampard took over at the club and opted to give young players such as Tammy Abraham the chance to shine up front.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Giroud has only started one of Chelsea FC’s 12 Premier League games this season and he is yet to start in the Champions League for Lampard’s men.</p>
      <p>Abraham has been keeping the likes of Giroud out of the first team with his brilliant performances, and the 22-year-old has scored 10 Premier League goals already this season.</p>
      <p>Zouma has now revealed that Giroud is clearly disappointed about his lack of playing time so far this season, but he will keep working hard behind the scenes as he looks to force his way back into contention.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1204741/Chelsea-Kurt-Zouma-Olivier-Giroud">Daily Express</a>, Zouma said: “He is frustrated, he wants to play more,</p>
      <p>“Like any football player, he wants to be on the pitch, but he is taking everything very calmly.</p>
      <p>“He is a professional, he works hard in training. I have a lot of respect for the player he is.</p>
      <p>“As someone in the dressing room, he is someone who gives advice to Tammy and Michy.</p>
      <p>“He wants the best for the team, which is important, and it is why he is a good person.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action after the international break with a crunch clash against Manchester City at The Etihad on Saturday 23 November.</p>
      <p>The Blues are currently third in the Premier League table.</p>
