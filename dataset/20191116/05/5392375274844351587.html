      <p>Sony’s mobile business has been going downhill for a few years now as its shipment volumes continue to dwindles. The once-popular brand, however, isn’t giving up just yet. Joining the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Nokia, and the rest, the Japanese firm this time is early to the Android 10 party update.</p>
      <p>The phone maker in a blog post earlier this week announced its Android 10 road map for a couple of its Xperia smartphones. According to the blog post, the brand will begin rolling out Android 10 updates to its smartphones beginning from December 2019.</p>
      <p>First on the <a href="https://blogs.sonymobile.com/2019/11/15/which-sony-products-will-receive-android-10-upgrades/#gref">list</a> of Xperia smartphones to get Android 10 update is the  Xperia X1 and recently announced <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/24/sony-xperia-5-released-in-china-news/">Xperia X5</a> — both of which will get Android10 in December 2019.</p>
      <p>That will be followed closely by the Xperia 10, 10 Plus, XZ2, XZ2 Compact, XZ2 Premium, and XZ3 devices from early 2020. The blog post detailing Sony’s Android 10 intention is clear on one thing – that the rollout is a phased one, and might depend on market and network operator. The update will probably first reach Sony Xperia users on <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/18/sony-xperia-android-10-iupdate-roadmap-emerges/">DoCoMo in Japan before a wider rollout</a>.</p>
      <p>While it is certain that the Xperia 1 and 5 will get the update in the coming month, Sony isn’t very clear on its “early 2020 onwards” plans for other devices on the list.</p>
      <p>So what becomes of other devices not on the list, well Sony is at the moment mute on that, but we hope the list will be updated in due course.</p>
