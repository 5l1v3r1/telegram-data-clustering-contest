So a huge thank you to all of you who've dared to try our software, given feedback (good or bad) and donated to the funding campaigns to help out with the development (which is hugely appreciated!).<br/><br/>Looking to the future, and with 2020 almost upon us, I took some time to put into words what I think the future holds for the Crowdrender project. So please check out the video and please leave us comments, tell us what you think!<br/><br/>Here's the TLDR for the video<br/><br/>Preferred method for making our project sustainable is community funding<br/>We're currently working on making the addon part of our system fully open source, hosting the code somewhere you can contribute to development and see how it all works. Thats a big project as we need to clean up the code, make sure we fully comply with the right licenses, etc. Its way more complicated than 'stick current addon code on github'! :P<br/>We're building a whole new system, based on a ton of user testing and feedback. This is going to be epically awesome once its built, but, it is a MASSIVE undertaking, so... ya know.. please help!!<br/>Thanks everyone :D</blockquote>
