      <p>Civil Society Organisations on Friday said the presence of soldiers at polling units would scare voters.</p>
      <p>They insisted that soldiers should stay off the vicinity of polling units during the governorship and Kogi West Senatorial elections in Kogi State today (Saturday).</p>
      <p>The groups commended the efforts of the security personnel for their preparedness towards the poll.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson for the CSOs, Dudu Manuga, spoke at the Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital.</p>
      <p>She urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure the conduct of a credible election.</p>
      <p>She said, “This election is the first major election since the 2019 general elections and it’s a tense environment. It is our expectation that INEC and other election stakeholders, including security agencies, would make every effort to improve on the quality and credibility of the general elections.</p>
      <p>“Kogi State has a history of electoral violence, as well as a high level of political thuggery when compared to other states of the federation, and has had numerous cases of inconclusive elections as a result. Presently, the Situation Room has received breakers of pre-election violence in many parts of the state, prominently at Anyigba in Dekina Local Government.”</p>
      <p>Manuga also called on security agencies to be non-partisan and provide adequate security during the election.</p>
