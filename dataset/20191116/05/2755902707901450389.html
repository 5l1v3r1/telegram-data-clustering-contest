      <p>Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Panonetsa Mangudya has said that cash withdrawals do not apply to everyone as some have special exceptions. Mangudya’s comments come after outraged Zimbabweans questioned how Ecobank and CBZ allowed certain customers to <b><a href="https://iharare.com/bank-responsible-for-leaking-new-notes-exposed/">withdraw $15 000</a></b> and<b> <a href="https://iharare.com/shocking-cbz-customer-busted-after-withdrawing-44-000-in-bond-coins-as-new-currency-floods-the-street/">$44 000</a></b> in cash when the weekly withdrawal limit stands at only $300 per individual.</p>
      <p>Speaking to national broadcaster <a href="https://www.zbc.co.zw/rbz-nothing-amiss-in-cash-withrawals-above-stipulated-miits/">ZBC</a>, Mangudya said,</p>
      <aside>There is no problem in withdrawing money above a stated limit, exemptions are permissible in the financial services sector. People who want to pay farmworkers, gold buyers often get these exemptions. What worries me is why one is posting money on social media? To cause alarm and despondency in the economy? So we need to change our laws to cater for that, the cybersecurity bill must come into effect.<br/>These are symptoms of a lack of national cohesion and being done by abnormal people. We supervise banks, and depositors are clients of banks, so when it gets to that level, it’s under the purview of financial institutions</aside>
