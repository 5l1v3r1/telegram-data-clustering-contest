      <p>One of the biggest surprises in <i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, out today from developer Respawn<i>,</i> is how much its approach to combat takes cues from the blueprint established by FromSoftware’s action role-playing games. If you’ve played <i>Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne,</i> or <i>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</i>, you know what to expect: Melee fights that require a degree of finesse, with careful dodging and necessity to learn the attack patterns of even the most trivial foes.</p>
      <p>Or at least, that’s the experience you get <i>sometimes</i>. <i>Fallen Order</i>’s combat is an attempt to make the intimidating-yet-rewarding FromSoftware approach more accessible, and it does this by telling you exactly how it handles difficulty. Before you start a game, you can pick your difficulty, which has four tiers: Story, Jedi Knight, Jedi Master, and Jedi Grandmaster. Each difficulty level adjusts three sliders: Parry timing leniency, damage received, and enemy aggression. (The first one is lowered on higher difficulty settings, while the latter two are increased.)</p>
      <p>If you’ve played and enjoyed any games in the <i>Souls</i> oeuvre, or if you want to get the most out of <i>Fallen Order</i>’s combat system, I recommend you go with Jedi Master, which is the game’s version of hard mode.</p>
      <p>There’s no need to worry much about my calling it “hard.” For most of the game, even in Jedi Master mode, combat scenarios are not that difficult; they just require some attention and a healthy amount of dodging. They can be <i>actually</i> hard if you take a seemingly-easy creature for granted (Listen: you’re gonna find some rams in this game. <i>Respect those goddamn rams.</i>) but most foes can’t take much punishment. The ones that can will frustrate you until you remember that your Force powers are there for a reason, and then they become easier.</p>
      <p>One caveat though: The difficulty curve in <i>Fallen Order</i> is not a smooth one. There are some fights that are, frankly, bullshit. If you ever stop having fun, just bump the difficulty down—<i>Fallen Order</i> lets you adjust at any time.</p>
      <p>Also, don’t get too caught up on the game being compared to <i>Dark Souls</i>. The comparison is definitely apt, but if that turns you off know that most of the fun in <i>Fallen Order</i> is in exploration. Think <i>Metroid</i> instead, and you’ll be fine. </p>
