      <p>Long-time Slashdot reader <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/~ClarkMills">ClarkMills</a> quotes New Zealand's Innovation Agency: <i>New 3D printing technology <a href="https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/MicroMaker3D-ENVI-Award">creating highly detailed objects, smaller than a strand of human hair</a>, has won the 2019 ENVI Engineering Innovation Award (Engineering New Zealand Awards). Micromaker3D, powered by breakthrough Laminated Resin Printing (LRP), makes it easy and more accessible to create detailed submillimetre structures for applications such as sensors, wearables, point-of-care diagnostics, micro-robotics or aerospace components.... LRP enables the printing of submillimetre structures with complex geometries of up to 100 per cent density, in extraordinary low-layer thicknesses and with imaging speeds as quick as one second per layer independent of complexity or density...<br/><br/>The judges saw MicroMaker3D as a gamechanger and believe it will spark many other innovations... The ENVI Engineering Innovation Award category is described as: "A breathtakingly clever engineering project or product that has solved an age-old problem or shifted from the 'always done this way' mentality...." <br/><br/>Callaghan Innovation is working to take the technology global, from the development and demonstration phase to commercial reality... </i><br/>Lead engineer Neil Glasson points out that while a human hair is about 100 microns in width, "we're looking at <i>five-micron</i> resolution."</p>
