      <h2>Chris Sutton praises Liverpool FC star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for his display for England v Montenegro</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:15:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:15</time> by <a rel="author">The Sport Review staff</a></address>
      <h3>Chris Sutton has heaped praise on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for his performance in England’s 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro on Thursday night.</h3>
      <p>The Liverpool FC midfielder played 56 minutes of the Euro 2020 qualifier and scored one of the Three Lions’ seven goals as they booked their place in next summer’s tournament in style.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain has been gradually working his way back to full fitness for Liverpool FC after having missed most of last season due to a serious knee problem.</p>
      <p>He has only started two of Liverpool FC’s 12 Premier League games so far this season but he has come off the bench six times for Jurgen Klopp’s men in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Sutton was highly impressed by Oxlade-Chamberlain’s performance on Thursday night as he helped Gareth Southgate’s men to book their place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7687461/Alex-Oxlade-Chamberlain-set-ball-rolling-Wembley-England-win-against-Montenegro.html">Daily Mail</a>, Sutton said: “He set himself with his first touch then blasted a ferocious shot into the back of the net with his second.</p>
      <p>“He made driving runs from midfield and was relentless in the centre of the pitch.</p>
      <p>“Gareth Southgate has never shied away from letting us know how highly he rates Oxlade-Chamberlain. ‘He would have been in the starting XI for the World Cup had he been fit,’ Southgate has said of the Liverpool player.</p>
      <p>“Oxlade-Chamberlain showed why on Thursday night, while Harry Winks kept things ticking over nicely alongside him.”</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain will be hoping to feature for Liverpool FC when the Reds return to Premier League action after the international break with a trip to Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The Reds are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table after having won 11 of their 12 games in the top flight so far this season to establish themselves as the heavy favourites for the title.</p>
