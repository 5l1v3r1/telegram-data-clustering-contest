      <p>Women are great storytellers. When they are telling even the most usual and ordinary stories, they always seem to be able to add something ironic or funny to them in order to make them bright and memorable. It is not surprising that forums for women and social media are full of different stories from their lives.</p>
      <p>We at <b>Bright Side</b> love women because they are they are easy-going and funny and this is why we couldn’t help but share these funny stories with you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My neighbor’s little kid just opened the window and shouted, “How much is 27 + 4?” I said, “31!” And he said, “Thank you, lady wonder! LADY WONDER, lol!” <a href="https://twitter.com/molokiss/status/1041800275793731585">© molokiss / Twitter</a></li>
        <li>I was at a bus stop with my boyfriend. There was a lady nearby selling flowers, vegetables, and stuff like that. She tried to get my boyfriend to buy me a bouquet of roses. And I said I didn’t like roses. But she knew what to say, “Then, buy her some tomatoes!” <a href="https://vk.com/wall-34215577_1200607">© Overheard / vk</a></li>
        <li>I work at a store where there is a cat. This black thing meets me 2 blocks away on my way to work, brings me mice and birds and apparently loves me very much since she spends most of her time on my lap. Little devil! I’m allergic!<a href="https://vk.com/wall-34215577_1200647"> © Overheard / vk</a></li>
        <li>My husband and I were playing role playing games. I was the doctor and he was the patient. I asked him if he was married. He said he was. “Is your wife beautiful?” He said, “Very.” I asked, “Is she more beautiful than me?” And then I saw a system failure on his face and the caption, “Critical error.” <a href="https://pikabu.ru/story/zhenshchinyi_3739326">© n1xn1xn1x / Pikabu</a></li>

        <li>My mother was watching a film with my grandma. The main character started to read some text in Latin. Grandmother said, “Turn the TV off now!” Mom: “Are you kidding me?” Grandma: “You’re going to summon something scary, it happened to Martha!” My grandfather comes in and says, “Why are you screaming?” My grandma: “See? I told you!” <a href="https://twitter.com/chern_ov/status/1172898759040282626">© chern_ov / Twitter</a></li>
        <li>I woke up in the morning because I heard a buzz saw sound and went outside to walk my dog. I saw this: a guy on his balcony, on the 2nd floor, was holding a buzz saw in his hands and trying to cut down a tree that was leaning toward the house. Obviously, the tree starts falling on the house and breaks the window on the third floor. 2 seconds of silence and then a female voice from the apartment where the man was says, “Told you.” <a href="https://pikabu.ru/story/a_ya_tebe_govorila_3705525">© One1ove / Pikabu</a></li>
        <li>My boyfriend made me angry and thought he would be able to just sit in the living room and watch TV in silence. But no. I told him I was going to a friend’s and downloaded a virtual remote app, hid in the bushes near the house and started messing with his TV. It lasted for 30 minutes and I enjoyed the view of him holding a baseball bat and running around the house calling his friend screaming about a ghost.</li>
        <li>A little boy in the street was pointing at me and asking his grandma where I was going to go with my green hair. She said, “She’s a mermaid, she came from the sea. Or is going back to the sea, I’m not really sure...” And both of them smiled at me. It’s the nicest thing I’ve ever heard from a stranger about my hair. <a href="https://twitter.com/youngnorthwind/status/1036675990599151616">© youngnorthwind / Twitter</a></li>
        <li>I have 3 cats and they absolutely hate me. Once, I decided to go to sleep in my mother’s room instead of my room. I was shocked when I saw that all 3 of them lying on me and purring. I looked at them from under the blanket and they were shocked to see me. They got really scared and ran away. <a href="https://vk.com/wall-34215577_1200512">© Overheard / vk</a></li>

        <li>In the morning, I saw this: my grandma would wake up in the early morning and go to the yard to cut flowers and put them in a vase in the kitchen. When the flowers died, she would do the same thing all over again. Then, I was coming back home and I saw my grandma with her 4 friends on a bench near the house. They were loudly discussing “that thief” that was stealing flowers from their gardens. My grandma was acting the most annoyed of them all about the stealing. She is an actress! I hope I inherited her skills! <a href="https://vk.com/wall-34215577_1200501">© Overheard / vk</a></li>
        <li>A girl I know found the Instagram page of her boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend and under the photos that said “Mine” left the comment, “Mine now.” Several days later, some other girl commented on her comment and said “That’s what you think.” Game on.</li>
        <li>I work in the HR department of a big company. My job is difficult and there is always something to do: a lot of people and a lot of paperwork. My boss is not a nice person and I work overtime pretty often. A girl came in for a job interview and while we were talking about the job conditions, we figured out that this was not what she was looking for. The girl started crying and left. In the evening, I was talking about this situation to my friend and she asked me, “She cried? Why? Did you offer her your position?” <a href="https://vk.com/wall-34215577_1200634">© Overheard / vk</a></li>
        <li>My grandma was putting a poster with Edward from <i>Twilight</i> in front of her bed. I asked her, “Where did you get this and why?” She said, “I got it in the store and I want to have an attractive man at least somewhere!” I said, “What about grandpa?” And she goes, “Your grandpa is ugly.” <a href="https://twitter.com/pttosn2ybfdplsd/status/1164485718372225024">© pttosn2ybfdplsd / Twitter</a></li>
