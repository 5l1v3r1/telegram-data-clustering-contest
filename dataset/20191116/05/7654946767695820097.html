      <h3>Big Weeks</h3>
      <p><b>Miles Sanders RB, Eagles, vs. Patriots (FanDuel $5,600/DraftKings $4,100)</b><br/>Despite having the top defense against fantasy RBs, the Pats have been slashed on the ground the past two weeks, giving up more than 140 yards rushing in each, and have yielded the seventh-most yards per carry on the season. Jordan Howard didn’t practice all week because of a stinger.</p>
      <p><b>Curtis Samuel WR, Panthers, vs. Falcons (FD $6,300/DK $5,300)</b><br/>The Falcons have given up the most fantasy points to QBs, who often throw to WRs. Atlanta is sixth-worst vs. fantasy WRs.</p>
      <p><b>Mohamed Sanu WR, Patriots, at Eagles (FD $5,800/DK $5,100)</b><br/>Had 14 targets in his second game with the Pats two weeks ago. The Eagles rank in the bottom third against fantasy WRs. Philly also has given up the fourth-most plays of 40 yards or more — not really Sanu’s forte, but he’s more likely than Julian Edelman to convert such a play.</p>

      <p><b>Jason Witten TE, Cowboys, at Lions (FD $5,600/DK $3,700)</b><br/>Detroit has given up an average of 16.9 fantasy points to tight ends over its past six games. He hasn’t scored since Week 2, so let’s call him “due.”</p>
      <h3>Small Weaks</h3>
      <p><b>Jared Goff QB, Rams, vs. Bears (FD $7,800/DK $5,900)</b><br/>We’re old enough to remember when the Rams’ offense was prolific. Alas, that isn’t the case this year. The Bears made him look clownish last season. Now, the Los Angeles O-line is worse, the Rams are missing Brandin Cooks and Todd Gurley’s decline has ruined the play-action game.</p>
      <p><b>Kenyan Drake RB, Cardinals, at 49ers (FD $6,300/DK $5,400)</b><br/>Yeah, he shockingly had a strong game two weeks ago against the Niners. And yes, you want to hold onto him with David Johnson’s struggles. But expect a motivated San Fran D to lock him down Sunday.<br/><b><br/>Allen Robinson WR, Bears, at Rams (FD $7,200/DK $6,000)</b><br/>A possible shadow by Jalen Ramsey, no thanks. Did we mention Mitchell Trubisky is his QB? Could Ramsey catch more Trubisky passes than Robinson?</p>
      <p><b>Terry McLaurin WR, Redskins, vs. Jets (FD $5,500/DK $5,600)</b><br/>He is TD dependent and hasn’t scored in three straight games. And though he is in an excellent matchup, he also has Dwayne Haskins as his QB. Maybe if it were Trubisky instead?</p>
