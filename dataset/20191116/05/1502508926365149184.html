      <h1>US to extend licence for its firms to continue business with Huawei: Report</h1>
      <h2>Trump administration added Huawei to an economic blacklist in May citing national security concerns.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:53:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:53</time> by <a rel="author">David Shepardson and Steve Holland | Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The Trump administration is set to issue a two-week extension of a licence allowing U.S. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>to continue doing business with China's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>Technologies Co Ltd, two sources familiar with the deliberations said.</p>
      <p>The extension of around two weeks is far shorter than the prior 90-day extension and a longer extension is in the works but has not yet been finalised due to regulatory hurdles, said one source who was briefed on the matter.</p>
      <p>After adding <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>to an economic blacklist in May citing national security concerns, the U.S. Commerce Department has allowed it to purchase some American-made goods in a move aimed at minimising disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.</p>
      <p>The extension will be announced on Monday, when the earlier reprieve is set to expire, the sources said, declining to be identified as the extension has not been publicly announced.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecom network equipment, said the company does not comment on rumors and speculation. The Commerce Department declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday that some rural carriers need the temporary licenses and are dependent on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>for 3G and 4G networks.</p>
      <p>"There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities - we don't want to knock them out. So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate," Ross said.</p>
      <p>The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.</p>
      <p>In blacklisting Huawei, the U.S. government said it had a "reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests". Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations.</p>
      <p>Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday Huawei and ZTE Corp "cannot be trusted," as he backed a proposal to bar U.S. rural wireless carriers from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services from them.</p>
      <p>In May, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>from using telecommunications equipment made by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>posing a national security risk. The Commerce Department was due to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October but has yet to publish one.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department is also considering whether to grant individual licenses for U.S. firms to sell components to Huawei after receiving more than 200 requests.</p>
