      <h1>LETTER: On vets, vettes and other vets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-16T05:00:00+00:00">16 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bruce W. Little Las Vegas</a></address>
      <p>Kudos to Review-Journal editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez for his Monday artwork titled “Honoring our veterans but losing the education battle.” I graduated from veterinary college some 55 years ago, and I cannot tell you how many times the confusion between veterinarians and veterans has come up in conversations.</p>
      <p>I happen to be both a veterinarian and a veteran, and, on many occasions, I tell people I am a retired veterinarian, only to have them respond with, “Oh, what branch did you serve in?”</p>
      <p>There are three types of “vets”: animal doctors, former military service members and Chevrolet sports cars. The abbreviation “vets” should be discontinued so that all three are spelled out as veterinarians, veterans and Corvettes. I am, however, sure that technology nerds will insist on using abbreviations to save characters on all social media platforms. Good job, Mr. Ramirez.</p>
