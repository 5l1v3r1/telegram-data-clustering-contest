      <p>America prog rock heroes Tool have confirmed their much-anticipated first tour of Australia in seven years. </p>
      <p>The band have booked arena concerts in support of their No. 1 album <i>Fear Inoculum</i> in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane in February.</p>
      <p>Fans hoping to souvenir moments of the show on their phones face immediate ejection with Tool instructing venue security to enforce their mobile-free policy.</p>

      <p>Concertgoers attending their current North American shows have been sent warnings about the policy as more artists complain about the disconnecting experience of performing to a barrage of mobile phones held aloft rather than fans engaged in the moment. </p>
      <p>“We respectfully request that you please watch and listen to the show, not your phone,” the email to American fans stated.</p>
      <p>“You will be ejected from the show without the opportunity to return and without a refund if you violate this simple request and elect to take photos during the performance. </p>

      <p>“In the event of a personal emergency, phone use may occur on the concourse away from the performance area.”</p>
      <p>A fan at a recent show in Cleveland shared a photo with the caption: “After the Cleveland audience was deemed ‘up to par,’ (frontman) Maynard told security to stand down and let the audience check their mail.”</p>
