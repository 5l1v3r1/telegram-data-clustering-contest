      <h1>No home run yet for Amarin’s heart drug Vascepa</h1>
      <h2>Cantillon: Unanimous FDA panel backing hides differences in view over potential</h2>

      <p>It would be churlish to try to put a dampener on the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Amarin">Amarin</a> team after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 16-0 to back a dramatic increase in the market for its <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_event=heart+drug">heart drug</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_event=Vascepa">Vascepa</a>.</p>
      <p>This, after all, is the same panel that six years ago nearly put Amarin out of business by denying it this wider approval and demanding the fledgling biotech carry out a protracted series of clinical trials to prove its case. Amarin was unlucky at that time that its highly purified fish-oil drug was seeking approval just as a number of highly touted fish-oil drugs failed.</p>
      <p>The setback forced the US-based Irish pharma to slash staff numbers in half and question publicly whether it could raise the necessary funds to pursue the Reduce-IT trial. At the time, it was reporting losses of close to $50 million (€36 million) on sales of $8.4 million.</p>
      <h3>Final decision</h3>
      <p>A search for a partner proved fruitless and Amarin was left with a $300 million burden. It persevered and, when the figures eventually arrived last year, they were even better than expected – at least by those outside the company – indicating a 25 per cent reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.</p>
      <p>The FDA panel confirms that the experts have bought into the Vascepa story. The FDA, when it makes a final decision later this year, is almost certain to back that view.</p>
      <p>But, despite the unanimous backing this time around, it remains to be seen quite how good the good news will be for Amarin.</p>
      <p>There was concern within the panel about side effects, such as bleeding among patients and also atrial fibrillation. More significantly, there was a debate about whether Amarin should be prescribed as a primary or secondary line of treatment – ie as a preventative therapy or one used only when evidence of disease is found.</p>
      <p>Either will mean a major increase in sales for the drug, but restricting its use to a secondary line of treatment will limit Amarin’s capacity to make a blockbuster out of its one and only drug.</p>
