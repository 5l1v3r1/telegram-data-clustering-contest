      <h1>Everton fans react as Gylfi Sigurdsson misses penalty but scores winner for Iceland</h1>
      <h2>The Icelandic international has been out of form from the penalty spot in recent times.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:15:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Everton midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson ended up being the hero as Iceland claimed a hard-fought win over Moldova in their Euro 2020 qualifier last night. The result, coupled with Albania’s loss to France, saw Iceland book their place in the qualification play-offs for the tournament next summer. </p>
      <p>Former Aston Villa midfielder Birkir Bjarnason gave Iceland the lead before Nicolae Milinceanu scored a second-half equaliser. </p>
      <p>However, Iceland soon had their winning goal when Sigurdsson swept home a cross from just inside the penalty area with his left foot. </p>
      <p>It was a tremendous finish from the Iceland talisman, who captained the side on the night and a needed boost for a player who has struggled for form at Everton this season. </p>
      <p>However, Everton fans picked up on something else from Sigurdsson’s performance.</p>

      <p>The 30-year-old had the perfect opportunity to put the game to bed in the 78th minute as Iceland were awarded a penalty. Unfortunately, his effort was well saved by Moldova keeper Alexei Koselev. </p>
      <p>Everton fans have gotten used to missed penalties from the playmaker, who was once very reliable from the spot. Sigurdsson missed just one of his first 21 penalty attempts. He has missed seven of the 14 he has taken since. </p>
      <p>For Everton, his record is three goals and three misses but he has been poor for Iceland recently as well. He missed against Andorra last month and of course, failed against Nigeria in the World Cup last summer.</p>
      <p>So whilst Everton fans were pleased to see Sigurdsson had scored, many are hoping they don’t have to see him taking a penalty for the Toffees anytime soon.</p>
