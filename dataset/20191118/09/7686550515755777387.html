      <p>Lorraine Kelly blasted Jennifer Arcuri during a Good Morning Britain interview after she refused to answer questions regarding the nature of her relationship with Boris Johnson. <br/><br/>Ms Arcuri appeared on the popular ITV breakfast show to clear the air following her previous appearance on the show and subsequent treatment in the press. <br/><br/>In an ITV documentary that aired yesterday (Sunday, November 17), Ms Arcuri claimed she had been tossed aside by Boris Johnson like one of John F Kennedy's girlfriends after being questioned as to whether she had an affair with the PM. <br/><br/>She talked about how she had been left "heartbroken" that he has refused to take her calls and feels she has been left to "pick up the pieces" amid the scandal. <br/><br/>However, when asked by GMB host Piers Morgan about whether she was in a "full-blown" relationship with the Prime Minister, she refused to answer.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to go anywhere near the relationship question." <br/><br/>After repeated questioning about whether or not her relationship with Boris was a romantic one, Ms Arcuri refused to outright confirm it.</p>

      <p>Bringing the interview to a close, Piers and Susanna Reid handed over to Lorraine to find out what was coming up on her show. <br/><br/>Looking rather annoyed, Lorraine proceeded to call out Ms Acuri live on air. <br/><br/>"What's the point in you coming on air to clear the air and not saying anything" she said. <br/><br/>Caught off guard, Jennifer responded in shock and said: "I'm sorry?"</p>
      <p>Lorraine repeated her question to Jennifier before moving on to discuss the line-up of her show. <br/><br/>GMB viewers were quick to praise Lorraine for calling Ms Arcuri out on social media. <br/><br/>One wrote: "Go on Lorraine!" <br/><br/>Another said: "Lorraine is an actual savage." <br/><br/>"Let's face it, Lorraine said what we all were thinking" another added. <br/><br/><b>Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.</b></p>
