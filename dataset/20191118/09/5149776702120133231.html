      <h1>The Lighthouse Family at Nottingham's Royal Concert Hall - review, set list and photos</h1>
      <h2>Paul did a great impression of Dick Dastardly</h2>

      <p>It has been more than eighteen years since the Lighthouse Family last released an album, but with their latest, Blue Sky In Your Head, they were back at the Royal Concert Hall to showcase those new tunes, along with their best known songs, to a packed crowd.</p>
      <p>Coming on with a minimum of fuss, Tunde Baiyewu took centre stage whilst Paul Tucker assumed his position behind his keyboard, hunched over and doing a great impression of Dick Dastardly with his big boots and furry collar.</p>

      <p>Impressing from the off, Tunde quickly commanded the minimalistic stage with his gentle moves and rich, powerful vocals on new songs My Salvation and Blue Sky In Your Head.</p>
      <p>Although the backing tapes were overpowering at the start, by the time Question Of Faith was given an airing Tunde was back on track.</p>

      <p>The very beautiful Put My Heart On You, inspired by Tunde’s five-year-old daughter, was a real highlight of the new songs and had the crowd hanging on every word, and when the band’s first big hit arrived, Lifted, they were on their feet and singing along.</p>
      <p>With two guitarists, a drummer and a female backing singer, the songs simply flowed. There was oldie Run and a truly beautiful, soulful rendition of Lost In Space, before the auditorium was decked out with swathes of light for the awesome slower Postcards From Heaven.</p>

      <p>Throughout the set there was chat from both band members but it was Tunde’s distinctive vocals that held everyone’s attention. And when the opening chords of Ocean Drive rang out, the crowd couldn’t stop themselves from singing along.</p>
      <p>Bringing the main set to a close with a rousing High, they were soon back on stage for (I Wish I Know How It Feels To Be) Free which rounded off a crowd pleasing set.</p>
