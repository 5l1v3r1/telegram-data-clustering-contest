      <p>The highlight of the concert, however, was the impressive crowd support. It was a sight to behold as almost the entire crowd illuminated the stadium with their phone flashlights.  The crowd also had sing-along sessions for some of his iconic songs like “unanswered prayers” and “friends in low places”</p>
      <p>The singer rose to fame with his incorporation of rock and pop elements to the country genre. With 148 million records sold in US alone, Brooks is the best selling solo artist in the country as per the Recording Industry Association of America(RIAA).</p>
