      <p>The chief executive and chair of St Ralph Sherwin Catholic Multi Academy Trust raised more than £3,000 for charity by jumping 13,500ft from a plane.</p>
      <p>CEO Sean McClafferty raised £1,508, including Gift Aid, for Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People, one of the Trust’s nominated charities, beating his target of £1,000.</p>
      <p>Trust Chair Jacqueline Rodden also surpassed her £1,000 target and raised £1,413, including Gift Aid, for Bluebell Wood Children’s Hospice, another of the Trust’s nominated charities. There were also cheques and cash donations totalling more than £250.</p>
      <p>Both Sean and Jacqueline completed their jumps at Langar Airfield, near Nottingham, and were delighted with the amounts raised.</p>
      <p>Sean is terrified of heights and said that completing the jump was a real challenge.</p>
      <p>He said: “This is something I never believed I could do and if I am honest it is something I shall never do again. It was terrifying. However, knowing that so much money had been raised for two such worthy causes gave me the courage to jump out of that plane!”</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said she was thrilled to have raised so much for Bluebell Wood Children’s Hospice.</p>
      <p>She said: ““Wow! What an adventure! Definitely a once in a lifetime event but I am glad to have done it and in the process raised so much for Bluebell Wood Children’s Hospice. I would like to thank all those who have supported us with donations and good wishes. The question now is, what are we going to do next in support of these amazing charities?”</p>
      <p>The Trust, which was formed in September 2018, is made up of 25 schools across five local authorities. It has pledged to fundraise for the children’s hospices for its first two years.</p>
      <p>In January, the Trust announced its charity partnership with Rainbows in Loughborough and Bluebell Wood Children’s Hospice, in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Rainbows, in Loughborough, cares for babies, children and young people with life-limited illnesses, including those from Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Bluebell Wood also cares for seriously ill children and young people across South Yorkshire, North Derbyshire, North Nottinghamshire and parts of Lincolnshire.</p>
