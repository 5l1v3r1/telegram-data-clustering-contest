      <p>“He is different. He is very crazy about football. He is so passionate and he gets so mad when we lose. It’s almost like he is the one who was playing. Sometimes you feel his pain. He gets so frustrated because he gives us all the right tools and sometimes we don’t use them and we end up losing the game, which makes him get frustrated. He is so passionate. He will come to you and tell you about the game you played, minute by minute,” Lebusa said. </p>
      <p>“If you don’t take your notes, then he will see that you didn’t. So, we as players also have to play our part. Whenever he calls you in and says, ‘Do you remember in the eighth minute you did this and this?’, you also have to take out your notes and tell him, Yeah, this is what I did,’ he added.</p>
