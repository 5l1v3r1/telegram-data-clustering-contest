      <p>A government ban on demonstrators wearing <a href="https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/asian-airlines-slash-flights-to-hong-kong-as-unrest-escalates-262832">face masks</a>, aimed at helping to quell months of pro-democracy unrest in Hong Kong, is unconstitutional, the territory's high court ruled Monday.</p>
      <p>"The restrictions it imposes on fundamental rights... go further than is reasonably necessary... and therefore fail to meet the proportionality test," the court said, according to a press summary.</p>
      <p>The ban on face-covering came into force in October, when the city's unelected pro-Beijing leader invoked colonial-era legislation for the first time in more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>The move was seen as a watershed legal moment for the city since its 1997 return by Britain to China but has been largely symbolic.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators, most of them wearing masks, have continued to <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/hong-kong-protesters-set-fire-to-hold-off-police-at-university-campus-262783">clash with police</a>, often violently, as they press their demands for greater democracy for Hong Kong, as well as an independent inquiry into alleged brutality by the increasingly unpopular police force.</p>
