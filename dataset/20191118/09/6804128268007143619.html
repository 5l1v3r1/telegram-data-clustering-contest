      <h1>Chelsea fans will love John Terry's message to Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount</h1>
      <h2>Both Blues' players featured in England's Euro qualifier vs Kosovo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:08:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author">Amie Wilson</a></address>
      <p>England's final Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo is not likely to be one that both Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount will forget anytime soon.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea duo were both bought on as second half substitutes in the 4-0 win, with Tomori replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold to make his senior international debut with six minutes to play.</p>
      <p>Mount was bought on in the 72nd minute replacing Alex Oxlade-Chamerlain. It was the midfielder's fourth appearance as an England player.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old had come close to scoring his first international goal in the 7-0 win vs Montenegro on Thursday, but made no mistake when the opportunity presented itself this time, bagging England's fourth goal of the game with a good finish beyond Kosovo goalkeeper Arijanet Muric.</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans were <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/chelsea-fans-loving-mount-tomori-17271778">full of pride after the Blues' player first goal for his country</a> , and there was someone else who took to social media to send a message to both Tomori and Mount during the match.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea captain John Terry played 78 times for the Three Lions, and also captained the country on many occasions.</p>
      <p>The Blues legend, posted on his Instagram stories as the Chelsea youngsters both reached significant milestones in their careers.</p>

      <p>"Congratulations. Yes mate," was his message when Tomori took to the pitch.</p>
