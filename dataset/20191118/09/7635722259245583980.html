      <h1>Glenn Whelan | "we need to go out there with real passion and a real fight to qualify"</h1>

        <b>The Republic of Ireland can secure automatic qualification for Euro 2020 with a win at home to Denmark but there is still the guarantee of the Nations League play-offs in March regardless of what happens at the Aviva Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's side also have the added incentive of knowing they would have two group games in Dublin next summer.</p>
      <p>The Boys in Green have played Denmark five times since November 2017 and are yet to get the better of the Danes.</p>
      <p>However, Glenn Whelan doesn't think the recent record will count for anything.</p>
      <p>"I think every team is beatable, we can’t worry about them too much.</p>
      <p>"They’ve got some top players but for us, we’re at home, we’ve got a chance to qualify so we’ve got to go and give our fans something to shout about and get them behind us.</p>
      <p>"This is where we want to be, this is why we’re here, this is why we show up and on nights like this it’s what everyone wants – to play for Ireland and to play for Ireland in a tournament."</p>

      <p>Whelan thought his international days were over when Martin O'Neill decided he was no longer part of his plans.</p>
      <p>However, the 35-year-old has started five of the Group D qualifiers since being brought back into squad by Mick McCarthy.</p>
      <p>The Hearts midfielder is now preparing for a huge game for Ireland.</p>
      <p>"This is a second bite at the cherry as it is. It was taken away from me. I was never going to play for my country again and now, please God, I’ll get picked to play in possibly one of the biggest games that Ireland have played in."</p>
      <p>Whelan believes the home crowd can play a huge part against Denmark.</p>
      <p>"We’re at home and we need to go out there with real passion and a real fight to qualify.</p>
      <p>"We’re going to need everyone on top form, the 11 that plays and the three lads that come off the bench because it’s going to be a tough night.</p>
      <p>"It’s not going to be easy and Denmark know that as well, that they’re coming in for a tough game and hard game."</p>
