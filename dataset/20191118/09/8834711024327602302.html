      <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the three life sentences handed down to the rapist and killer of Uyinene Mrwetyana were befitting of the crimes.</p>
      <p>In his weekly newsletter, he labeled the offences as heinous.</p>
      <p>On Friday, former Post Office worker Luyanda Botha pleaded guilty to raping and murdering the 19-year-old.</p>
      <p>He entered into a plea agreement.</p>
      <p>President Ramaphosa said that the emergency action plan to deal with gender-based violence was being implemented.</p>
      <p>The president said that various government departments had reprioritised R1.6 billion for the plan to be funded and put in place.</p>
      <p>It included improving access to justice for survivors of violence and prevention campaigns. Clearing case backlogs, he said, was a priority.</p>
      <p>To this end, the plan would also strengthen the criminal justice system. The plan would also see 312 police recruits being trained to join the family violence, child protection unit.</p>
      <p>Ramaphosa said that 11 more sexual offences courts would be completed by the end of the current financial year.</p>
