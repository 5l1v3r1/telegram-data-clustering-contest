      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RoyKeane">Roy Keane</a> has claimed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/declan-rice">Declan Rice</a> has “played his way out of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-0">England</a> team”.</p>
      <p>The West Ham midfielder started at the base of the midfield against Kosovo, but was omitted from the line-up vs Montenegro.</p>
      <p>And Keane, who worked with Rice with Ireland before he switched allegiances, believes the midfielder has a lot to work on.</p>
      <p>“Where he needs to improve, there are plenty of aspects when you think about it,” Keane told ITV Sport.</p>
      <p>“Over the last few months he has had a lot of praise, I worked with him when he was with the Ireland squad.</p>
      <p>“Where does he need to improve, where do you want me to start?</p>
      <p>“His positional play, I don’t think is consistent enough, he doesn’t stay with runners, he’s sloppy in possession.</p>

      <p>“I can go on. He’s one of those players, a couple of months ago everyone was enjoying him and loved him.</p>
      <p>“He’s one of those players that’s now played his way out of the team because he’s not been consistent for West Ham.”</p>
