      <p>Gillian McKeith has claimed that her I’m a Celebrity stint in 2010 has left her battling with PTSD.</p>
      <p>The health expert was seen struggling through bushtucker trials as well as life in the jungle, with the audience at home repeatedly voting her to do more.</p>
      <p>She eventually fainted live on-air after being tasked with another trial.</p>
      <p>Gillian is now stating being put through the trials and tasks, which included eating bugs, swimming through infested waters and being buried underground, has left her scarred.</p>
      <p>‘When I look back at the jungle, it’s like the stuff of nightmares. It was like being in a horror movie, to be honest,’ she told <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/im-celebs-gillian-mckeith-says-20900227">Daily Star Online</a>, adding she’s still not ‘fully recovered’ from the experience.</p>
      <p>‘I honestly think I’m suffering from PTSD,’ she continued.</p>

      <p>‘That has completely done me in, that is the worst.’</p>
      <p>As a result of her time in the jungle, Gillian added that she’s been left claustrophobic and won’t even get in lifts if she feels they’re too small, and won’t lock bathroom doors.</p>

      <p>Gillian’s comments come as 10 new celebrities kicked off this year’s series – starting with a sky-dive and walking a plank 300ft in the air.</p>
      <p>Two more stars are reportedly due to join in the series – Coronation Street’s Andy Whyment and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/former-eastenders-star-cliff-parisi-revealed-secret-12th-im-celebrity-campmate-11173036/">Eastenders’ star Cliff Parisi</a>.</p>
      <p>The camp were then split into two – with only Myles Stephenson, Ronan Kemp, Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts making it into the main “luxury” (using that term loosely) camp, while the other six were left in the basic campsite.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa and Kate Garraway ended up wearing their knickers on their head in a bid to stop bugs from crawling on them in their sleep – while Ian Wright burned their meagre rations.</p>
      <p>As you can imagine, that went down like a lead balloon for campmate James Haskell, whose 4,000 calorie a day diet has now been shrunken down to nothing.</p>
