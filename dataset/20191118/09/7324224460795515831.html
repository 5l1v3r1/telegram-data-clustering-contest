      <h1>West Brom consider permanent Chris Willock move</h1>
      <h2>Albion are assessing whether to make Chris Willock’s loan move permanent – with the club having the option to buy the winger in January.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:18:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>A former Arsenal trainee, Willock joined the Baggies on loan from Benfica in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, who can play out wide or in the number 10 role, is yet to make a first-team appearance for Slaven Bilic’s side.</p>
      <p>But he is still deemed to be a player with real potential by the Albion hierarchy and has impressed in seven outings for the under-23s.</p>
      <p>The Express &amp; Star understands the loan deal which took Willock to The Hawthorns includes an option for the transfer to be made permanent for what has been described by Albion as a “reasonable fee.”</p>
      <p>And the Baggies will continue to assess the forward before deciding whether to activate their option.</p>
      <p>Willock comes from a footballing family with his brother’s Joe and Matty midfielders at Arsenal and Gillingham respectively.</p>
      <p>His first-team opportunities at Albion have largely been limited due to the form of Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira, Matt Phillips, Kyle Edwards and Filip Krovinovic.</p>
      <p>But the forward is enjoying his time at the club and working hard to force his way into Bilic’s plans.</p>
      <p>“My main goal is to get minutes in the first-team,” Willock said.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I can do that soon. I spoke to the boss a few weeks ago and he said I need to be to patient and wait for an opportunity and keep working hard.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I intend to do I think the team has a lot of quality and it’s show’s because the team is playing very well, the boss has a good relationship with all the players and hopefully the first-team can carry on with their recent form.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Albion have issued a reminder that half-season tickets are now on sale.</p>
      <p>Priced from £199 for adults, the tickets begin on December 29 when Middlesbrough visit The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>Fans buying a half season ticket are also eligible for reduced entry for the clash against Brentford on December 21.</p>
      <p>Tickets for that game are priced at £10 for adults and £5 for under-23s when buying a half season ticket.</p>
