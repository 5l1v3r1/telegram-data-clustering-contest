      <p>The Supreme Court’ ruling (albeit with some caveats) putting the office of the Chief Justice of India under the purview of RTI Act is welcome. It is certainly a precedent that promises to usher in more transparency in public matters. Many prominent institutions including BCCI have earlier opposed any move to bring them under RTI. Kudos to Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who before retiring as CJI, led the apex court admirably in delivering the historic Ayodhya title suit verdict and other crucial judgments including the RTI case.</p>
