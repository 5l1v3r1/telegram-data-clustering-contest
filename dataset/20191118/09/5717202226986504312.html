      <h1>Tim Sherwood makes prediction about Harry Winks that Tottenham fans will love</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:45:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Tim Sherwood has told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT (Monday, 9:15am) that he believes Tottenham star Harry Winks is the answer to Gareth Southgate’s woes at the base of his England midfield.</p>
      <p>Winks, 23, started and finished both games against Montenegro and Kosovo during the international break – taking his tally to six England caps. He even opened his account for the Three Lions, scoring the first in a 4-0 win over Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Talk of who will start at the base of the England midfield is now up in the air, with Declan Rice struggling at club level with West Ham. Jordan Henderson, though, is in excellent form as he continues to captain Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Everton’s Fabian Delph and Tottenham’s Eric Dier are also in with a shout but former Spurs boss Sherwood believes Winks will be the pick of the bunch to start in the defensive-midfield role ahead of Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">“For me, if you look at the England squad, I think Winks is going to be the number six,” Sherwood said. “He’s got good awareness, he’s got pace, he’s not afriad to pass through the lines rather than keep it safe. </span>
        <span dir="auto">It is between Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice, he hasn’t got the experience but he is my pick for the position.”<br/></span>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Winks is the best of the rest, but Tottenham need to help</h3>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino could hold the key to whether Winks will start at Euro 2020 – or be forced to watch from the bench. That is because Winks has been in and out of the Spurs side this season.</p>
      <p>If the England star can become a regular at club level, then there is no reason why he should be benched for Euro 2020. Indeed, over the last two matches for England he has shown he has the quality to become first choice.</p>
