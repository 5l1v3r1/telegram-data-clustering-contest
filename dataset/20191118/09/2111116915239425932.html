      <h3>Half-Life 3 may be MIA – but a Half-Life VR game could still be in the works</h3>
      <p>Is Half-Life: Alyx one of the three rumored VR titles Valve is cooking?</p>

      <p>For a game that's never been officially announced, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/half-life-3-release-date-news-and-rumours-1290663">Half-Life 3</a> might be the most long-awaited game of all time. And while its series developer, Valve, shows no sign of revealing it any time soon, there's a glimmer of hope for headcrab-blasting fans in VR.</p>
      <p>What is claimed to be a leaked interview transcript between Valve executives suggests that a new Half-Life title is on the way called Half-Life: Alyx, and that it'll be a virtual reality exclusive.</p>
      <p>The interview is said to be between a "Geoff", which is likely games broadcaster Geoff Keighley (responsible for the annual Game Awards and the 'Final Hours' documentaries about Valve games), Robin Walker (co-developer of Team Fortress 2) and an unnamed third party.</p>
      <p>"March 2020, 'Half-Life: Alyx' comin' out", says the Geoff in the transcript, which also suggests the game will be revealed at The Game Awards on December 12.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>VR focus</h4>
      <p>For the time being, and if the transcript is to be believed, the focus is very much on VR at the moment, rather than an optional keyboard and mouse version.</p>
      <p>"I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard, but like as we said, it began as an exploration of VR," says the unnamed person.</p>
      <p>Leaked by the same source that revealed DOTA Underlords, there are a few details that add veracity to the piece, such as this quote on play testers:</p>
      <p>"You can see their whole body-- [sic]Respond to the situation. You know, panicking, dropping clips on the ground as they fumble their weapons 'cause a zombie's in front of them, all these things, they're just - it's been really fun watching playtests."</p>
      <p>So, can it be believed? Any mention of new Half-Life content from Valve has to be taken with a pinch of salt – it's known that the company has played with ideas around the franchise for many years, but it's highly secretive and has as-yet failed to commit to any of its Half-Life experiments.</p>
      <p>However, with the release of its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/valve-index">Valve Index VR</a> headset earlier this year, Valve did state that it would be releasing a 'flagship VR game' before the end of the year. There wouldn't be a bigger flagship property for Valve than Half-Life.</p>
