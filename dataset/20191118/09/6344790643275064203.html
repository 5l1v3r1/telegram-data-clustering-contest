      <h1>Ryan Murphy and FX Are Discussing Ten More Seasons of AMERICAN HORROR STORY</h1>

      <p>If you’re a fan of<b> Ryan Murphy</b>’s horror anthology series <b><i>American Horror Story</i></b>, you’ll be happy to learn that the series isn’t going to end anytime soon. Both Murphy and the FX network want to keep the show going beyond Season 10, which will debut in 2020, and according to Murphy, they’ve discussed keeping the show going for another ten seasons!</p>
      <p>While speaking with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/american-horror-story-season-10-spoilers-ryan-murphy-ahs-1984-interview-season-finale-ratched-hollywood-streaming-dates-1202785704/">Deadline</a>, Murphy said:</p>
      <blockquote>“John Landgraf has always been incredibly honorable about American Horror Story and he would obviously like to keep it going, and I’d like to keep it going. We’re in the middle of negotiations about beyond season 10. We have had conversations about the show going 20 seasons.”</blockquote>
      <p>I’ve enjoyed watching American Horror Story and it’s pretty cool to see how far it’s come. Ten seasons is quite an accomplishment and the fact that the series has a real potential of having a total of twenty seasons is both surprising and cool! I never thought that the show would last that long!</p>
      <p>I guess as long as the creators keep pumping out crazy, strange, weird, fun, and creepy stories and people keep watching, then there’s no reason to cancel the show yet. During the interview, Murphy was asked if <i>American Horror Story</i> would ever make the leap to being a Netflix original if FX one day decided to cancel the show and this was his response:</p>
      <blockquote>“If John for some reason said, ‘We don’t want to make this anymore,' would I call up Netflix? Yes. But he’s only ever expressed love and enthusiasm and he wants to keep it going. We’re both very proud of it. It’s FX’s most highly rated show in the history of the network, it’s had 96 Emmy nominations. I hope, knock wood, we'll get past 100. It’s one of the most awarded and lauded shows of that network. I have every good intention of it staying there and I think he does too. We’re talking about it. We’re trying to figure it out.”</blockquote>
      <p>There are no details on what the story for Season 10 will entail, but the creator did say that they are in talks with some fan-favorite cast members from the early seasons of the show to come back for another round of terror.</p>
      <p>Are you happy to learn that American Horror Story could possibly go another ten years?</p>
