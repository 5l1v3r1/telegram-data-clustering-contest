      <h1>Reds named among several Premier League suiters for England U18 captain and Wigan starlet Joe Gelhardt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:27:56+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have been named alongside the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United when it comes to the race to sign Wigan Athletic starlet Joe Gelhardt.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old striker is also interesting Tottenham, Manchester City and Everton, according to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-join-man-utd-liverpool-20897626">Daily Star</a>.</p>
      <p>All seven of his Championship appearances this season have come off the bench, but Gelhardt has been on the radar of several Premier League sides for some time now.</p>
      <p>Gelhardt is valued at around £5 million and is known to be a Reds fan – says the original report – so Jurgen Klopp and Michael Edwards might have an advantage in any transfer race.</p>
      <p>He actually came up against the Reds’ U23s back in October in the Premier League Cup, scoring a brace at The Academy as Neil Critchley’s men beat their North-West opponents 3-2. Gelhardt certainly impressed on that occasion as he was a clear standout in the Wigan side.</p>
      <p>Snapping up the best young talent in the country can certainly not be a bad thing, so if this is a deal the Reds want and can get done, it would appear to make a lot of sense.</p>
