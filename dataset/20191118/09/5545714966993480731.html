      <h1>Pokemon Sword and Shield is running a free Gigantamax event through early January</h1>
      <h2>It's live now</h2>

      <p>It looks like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-in-progress-pokemon-sword-572679.phtml"><i>Pokemon Sword </i>&amp; <i>Shield</i></a> will be running periodic free events that focus on the new raid concept, and the first one is live. <a href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/gameplay/gigantamax/encounter/">Straight from the official site</a>, it looks like from now through 'early January 2020," folks will be able to encounter a Gigantamax Butterfree in Max Raid Battles.</p>
      <p>What are those? Well, about 45 minutes into <i>Sword &amp; Shield</i>, on your way to the first major town, you'll come across the Wild Area. This is Game Freak's MMO-like experiment, where other players are randomly running around haphazardly, doing cooperative raids together and catching new daily-cycled creatures.</p>
      <p>It's easily one of the most fun parts of the game and one of the best additions to the series in a while. You don't really have to do anything special to make use of this promo: just exist and try out those raids!</p>
