      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pakistan">Pakistan </a>on Monday conducted a successful test launch of a surface-to-surface <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ballistic-missile">ballistic missile </a>capable of delivering all types of warheads up to 650 kilometres, the military announced.</p>
      <p>According to a press release issued by the media wing of Pakistani military, the launch of Shaheen-I missile was held as part of a training exercise "aimed at testing the operational readiness of Army Strategic Forces Command".</p>
      <p>The Shaheen-1 missile is capable of delivering all types of warheads up to range of 650 KMs, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) tweeted.</p>
      <p>"The launch was aimed at testing operational readiness of Army Strategic Forces Command (ASFC) ensuring Pakistan's credible minimum deterrence," it said.</p>
      <p>The Pakistani missile test came days after India conducted the first night trial of 'Agni-II', its versatile surface-to-surface medium range nuclear-capable missile.</p>
      <p>The 'Agni-II' missile has a strike range of 2,000 km and is an intermediate range <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ballistic-missile">ballistic missile.</a> It has already been inducted into the armed forces.</p>
      <p>The Pakistani missile test took place amid bilateral tensions between India and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pakistan">Pakistan </a>after New Delhi abrogated the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two union territories.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pakistan">Pakistan </a>reacted strongly to India's decision and downgraded bilateral ties and expelled the Indian envoy.</p>
      <p>India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter. It has also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.</p>
