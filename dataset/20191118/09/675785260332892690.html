      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:16:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:16</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/xbox">Xbox</a> ’s chief has made a not-so-subtle dig at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> ’s upcoming game streaming service, Stadia - the day before it launches.</p>
      <p>Described as the ‘ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> for games’, Stadia uses Google's global network of data centres to make games accessible over the internet on a variety of platforms, including computers, tablets, smartphones and TVs.</p>
      <p>While many gamers are excited for this launch, Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, claims that there’s still years to go before game streaming becomes mainstream.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-50427414/xbox-s-boss-years-before-game-streaming-is-mainstream">Speaking to BBC Click</a> at the X019 conference, Mr Spencer compared Stadia to Project xCloud - Xbox’s own game streaming service, which is still in its public testing phase.</p>
      <p>When asking whether Xbox is playing catch-up to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> , Mr Spencer said: “My view is we’re all in the testing phase. We’re early in this technology, and we view that it will take many years before this technology becomes mainstream.</p>

      <p>“The best place for you to play will be on your local device - your console, your Xbox, connected to your TV for many years. Same thing for gaming PC.</p>
      <p>“The local compute ability that you have, you’re not dealing with internet irregularities, you’re dealing with a dedicated device that’s meant to go play those games.”</p>
      <p>Mr Spencer added that Xbox is working with the public as it develops its Project xCloud service, taking their feedback on board.</p>
      <p>He said: “We evolve our technology and experiences hand-in-hand with our customers, so they give us feedback on what’s working and what they’d like to see more of. Project xCloud right now is out, we’re getting that feedback from thousands and thousands of players who are able to play games today.”</p>
      <p>Google Stadia will launch tomorrow with 12 games.</p>
      <p>In a blog about the games, the Stadia Team wrote: “We’re launching Stadia with 12 carefully-chosen games on day one, and an additional 14 will be available by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“There’s something for everyone here: a library of superb, critically-acclaimed titles spanning multiple genres and age ratings.”</p>
