      <p>St Mirren gaffer Jim Goodwin says he doesn’t understand players who can’t be bothered to turn up for their country - insisting he would have walked over broken glass to play for his.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Goodwin</a> was involved in the Ireland set up from his teenage years, making his debut against Finland in 2002 replacing one of his country’s heroes Robbie Keane.</p>
      <p>And he simply can’t understand the mentality of some Scottish players who have decided against joining up with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> ’s side as they prepare for the Euro 2020 play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>He told Express Sport: “I was fortunate to play for Ireland from the under-15 side right up to senior level.</p>
      <p>“I only got one cap, but any time the under-21 team or under-18 team was being announced I was desperate to be in it.</p>
      <p>“I would have walked over broken glass to play for my country.</p>
      <p>“There was never a thought in my mind that I needed a break or I wanted to spend time with my family. That never even crossed my mind.</p>
      <p>“It disappoints me that there are players out there with that mindset, who would rather go and spend a few days in Dubai with their wife rather than represent their country.</p>
      <p>“I think we’d be very naive to think it doesn’t happen. I think it does happen.</p>
      <p>“Now 95 per cent of players out there - English, Scottish, Irish, whatever - the majority are passionate about playing for their countries.</p>
      <p>“But I think there’s a small group in every country that can’t really be bothered.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> player Clarke has been hit with a number of calls-offs already in his short reign in charge of the national team.</p>
      <p>And while that has hampered his attempts to build the club atmosphere he is looking to instil at Hampden, Goodwin believes it won’t take him long to root out who is fully commmited to the cause.</p>
      <p>He said: “If players are genuinely injured there’s not much you can do. The frustration I have with internationals, and I see it with Ireland all the time, is when a boy can’t play one week for the national team but is then fit again for his club the following weekend.</p>
      <p>“If that’s the case you’ve got to root them out and you don’t involve them. No matter how good, bad or indifferent they are.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I know clubs pay the wages and the player belongs to the club, but it’s got to be the pinnacle of your career as a player or a manager to represent your country. That’s got to be the goal.</p>
      <p>“Steve Clarke needs a group of 32 players he can pick from that are dedicated to the cause and he’s not naive. He’ll soon figure out who is in and who isn’t.”</p>
