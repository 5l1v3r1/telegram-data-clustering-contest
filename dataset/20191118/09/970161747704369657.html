        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/everton-fc/">Everton</a> had the opportunities to sign Erling Haaland, Andrew Robertson, Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans but rejected them all, according to the club’s former director of football, Steve Walsh.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After building a formidable reputation for talent-spotting at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/leicester-city-fc/">Leicester City</a>, Walsh moved to Everton in July 2016 after making a number of bargain signings for the Foxes.</p>
      <p>Walsh was credited with unearthing talents such as N’golo Kante, Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, and played a huge part in Leicester’s unlikely <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> title win in 2016.</p>
      <p>Much was expected him at Everton, with the backing of owner Farhad Moshiri, but Walsh could not replicate the success he had at the King Power and was sacked in May 2018.</p>
      <p>The veteran scout claims that he is not to blame for the failures at Goodison Park and he actually lined up a number of excellent deals, but the club simply did not back his decisions.</p>

      <p>If the Toffees had gone with his suggestions, they could have picked up some of the most valuable players in Europe, for next to nothing, according to Walsh.</p>
      <p>‘While I was at Everton, I offered them Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire deals, when they were at Hull, and it was worth £20 million for the pair. Everton wouldn’t take them,’ Walsh told the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">Athletic.</a></p>

      <p>‘I had a deal done for Jonny Evans too before he came to Leicester, but again they wouldn’t take him.</p>
      <p>‘Erling Haaland, the striker with Salzburg, I had him and his dad at the club with a deal done for £3.4m (€4m). The club wouldn’t back me.’</p>
      <p>Robertson has gone on to be a fixture in the Liverpool side which won the Champions League last season and Maguire is not the world’s most expensive defender after his £80m move to Manchester United from Leicester.</p>
      <p>Haaland appears unstoppable in front of goal for Red Bull Salzburg and is likely to make a big-money move in the summer to one of the biggest clubs in Europe, with Manchester United hoping to tempt him to the Premier League.</p>
