      <p>OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets today with the king of Jordan.</p>
      <p>It is King Abdullah II’s fifth visit to Canada in his twenty years on the throne of the Middle Eastern country.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister’s Office says the two will discuss the partnership between Canada and Jordan and efforts to promote diversity and counter violent extremism.</p>
      <p>They’ll also discuss ongoing regional security concerns, exacerbated in recent weeks by the repeated violation of a ceasefire in the Syrian civil war.</p>
      <p>Upwards of 660,000 Syrians have sought shelter from the conflict in neighbouring Jordan, and thousands of them have since been resettled to Canada under a marquee Liberal program that originated in a campaign promise during the 2015 election.</p>
      <p>That year, Trudeau promised to bring 25,000 Syrians to Canada and it is four years ago this month in Jordan that the Liberal government kicked off a multi-billion-dollar program that would eventually see nearly 40,000 Syrians arrive.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published on Nov. 18, 2019.</p>
