      <h1>INX Media: ED Moves Delhi HC To Correct Factual Errors In Chidambaram's Bail Order</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:12:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Karan Tripathi</a></address>
      <p>The Enforcement Directorate on Monday moved an application before the Delhi High Court seeking corrections in the order rejecting bail to P Chidambaram, as passed by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, on the grounds of it having <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/facts-from-another-case-gets-reproduced-in-delhi-hcs-chidambaram-bail-order-149859">certain factual errors.</a></p>
      <p>In paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait in Chidambaram's case, portions from the order in Rohit Tandon's case can be found.</p>
      <p>One of the said identical paragraphs is:</p>
      <p>'..<i>.it is alleged that during the period from 15.11.2016 to 19.11.2016, huge cash to the tune of â‚¹31.75 crore was deposited in eight bank accounts in Kotak Mahindra Bank in the accounts of the 'Group of Companies'. It gives details of Demand Drafts issued during 15.11.2016 to 19.11.2016 from eight bank accounts in the name of Sunil Kumar, Dinesh Kumar, Abhilasha Dubey, Madan Kumar, Madan Saini, Satya Narain Dagdi and Seema Bai on various dates. Most of the Demand Drafts issued have since been recovered".</i></p>
      <p>These portions have seemingly no relation with Chidambaram's case.</p>
      <p>Therefore, ED moved an application seeking rectification of the same.</p>
      <p>Rohit Tandon, a lawyer, is accused of laundering Rs 31.75 crores post the demonization timeline, by layering the amount through various banks.</p>
      <p>In the ED matter against him, P Chidambaram is accused of layering the alleged amount received through FIPB clearances given, during his tenure as the Finance Minister, through various shell companies abroad, bank accounts, and by generating fake invoices.</p>
      <p>The Delhi High Court denied him bail <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/breaking-delhi-hc-denies-bail-to-p-chidambaram-bail-in-ed-case-in-inx-media-scam-149803">observing that </a>there was prima facie evidence that he played "key and active part" in the conspiracy. Observing that economic offences were grave offences, the judge noted that allowing bail in such a case will send a wrong message to the public.</p>
      <p>Chidambaram has also moved the Supreme Court with an appeal against Justice Kait's order. The hearing for the same might take place either on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
