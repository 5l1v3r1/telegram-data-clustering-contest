      <p>Somalia and Libya are the most perilous places to visit on Earth in 2020, according to a new guide for travellers.</p>
      <p>The interactive ‘Travel Risk Map’ judges countries based on how much trouble visitors are likely have with health, security and road safety.</p>
      <p>If you’re feeling worried about where to book flights to next year, Norway, Finland and Iceland are ranked as the world’s safest destinations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.travelriskmap.com/#/planner/map/">The map</a> has been created by international medical and security specialists International SOS.</p>
      <p>Closely following Lybia and Somalia are Afghanistan and Venezuela, who rank poorly in all three risk categories.</p>

      <p>African countries including Niger, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea score lowly when it comes to health risk, along with Yemen, Syria and North Korea.</p>

      <p>But tourists and business people visiting Europe, the US, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and Australia have the lowest chances of catching diseases.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Libya and Somalia all pose an extreme security threat to travellers but the risk is negligible in Greenland, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Switzerland and Slovenia.</p>
      <p>Some of the world’s most dangerous roads belong in Venezuela, Belize, Saudi Arabia, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam and Thailand.</p>

      <p>But driving in Europe is pretty safe in comparison, along with New Zealand, Australia and Japan.</p>
      <p>International SOS MD Doug Quarry said: ‘The threats facing organisations and their workforces are impacting established and emerging economies alike.</p>
      <p>‘It’s encouraging to see that decision makers are becoming increasingly aware of the threats of epidemics and infectious diseases.’</p>
      <p>‘With accurate information, tools and support in place, organisations should, and can, plan for the anticipated risks and safeguard their investment and their people.’</p>
