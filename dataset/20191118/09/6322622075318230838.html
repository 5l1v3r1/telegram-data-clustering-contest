      <p>BANGKOK (Nov 18): The strength of Thailand's baht is a concern for the trade-reliant economy that is expected lag the central bank's growth forecast for this year, the Bank of Thailand governor said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"We are very worried about the baht," BOT Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob told a seminar in the southern province of Songkhla.</p>
      <p>The baht is Asia's best performing currency this year, rising 7.7% against the US dollar, and putting further pressure on exporters amid global trade tensions.</p>
      <p>The baht has been underpinned by Thailand's large current account surplus, while its strong external position — with high foreign reserves and low foreign debt — has also attracted fund inflows, Veerathai said.</p>
      <p>"We are a safe haven," he said.</p>
      <p>The BOT has taken action on any rapid gains in the baht, reflected by rising foreign reserves, he added.</p>
      <p>This year's economic growth is expected to undershoot the central bank's forecast of 2.8%, Veerathai said.</p>
      <p>Last week, Deputy BOT Governor Mathee Supapongse told Reuters the BOT's growth estimates for 2019 and 2020 would be cut at its next monetary policy meeting on Dec. 18.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, Thailand reported its weakest on-quarter growth in a year for the second quarter, at 0.1%, while the annual pace of 2.4% was lower than expected.</p>
      <p>The national planning agency, which compiled GDP data, cut its 2019 growth estimate to 2.6% from 2.7-3.2%.</p>
