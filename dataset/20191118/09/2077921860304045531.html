      <h1>The 50 Best Horror Movies on Netflix Right Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:45:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Vorel &amp; Paste Movies Staff  </a></address>
      <p>To date, 2019 has been a mixed bag as far as the breadth of the <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> horror library is concerned. As competing services, and especially genre-specific ones such as Shudder, continue to expand their horror movie collections, it’s harder and harder for Netflix to project any sense of comprehensiveness. At various points last year for instance, Netflix could boast <i>The Shining</i>, <i>An American Werewolf in London</i>, <i>Jaws</i> or <i>Young Frankenstein</i>, along with recent indie greats like <i>Starry Eyes</i>, <i>The Descent</i> or <i>The Babadook</i>. All of those films are now gone—typically replaced by low-budget, direct-to-VOD films with suspiciously similar one-word titles, like <i>Demonic</i>, <i>Desolation</i> and <i>Satanic</i>.</p>
      <p>Still, there are quality films to be found here, typically of the modern variety, from classics like <i>Carrie</i> to more obscure (and disturbing) titles such as <i>The Endless</i> or <i>The Invitation</i>. Don’t expect to find many franchise staples in the mold of <i>Halloween</i> or <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>, but don’t sleep on <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>, either. It’s not technically a movie, but it’s impossible to leave off this list.</p>
      <p>We invite you to use this list as a guide. The lowest-ranked films are of the “fun-bad” variety—flawed, but easily enjoyable for one reason or another. The highest-ranked films are obviously essentials.</p>

      <p><b>50. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=the%20monster&amp;jbv=80150242&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0">The Monster</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2016<br/><b>Director:</b> Bryan Bertino<br/>Bryan Bertino’s <i>The Monster</i> takes place at the crossroads between a serviceable drama and a middling horror film. Each exists in its own parallel dimension, and despite the director’s clear intentions to bring those dimensions together, each is a detriment to the other. On one hand, we have a family drama revolving around an addict single mother and her nebulously aged daughter, who I believe the film would like me to describe as “precocious” for reasons that are in no way earned. Mom hits the bottle hard, and perhaps dabbles in some other substances as well, while fighting anyone who gets close enough for her to yell at. Some of these sequences are effective enough, such as the flashback to a screaming match the mother and daughter have in the garage as their relationship fractures further. Others are genuinely irritating, especially any instance where the daughter, clearly too old for stuffed animals, escapes into fantasy with a stuffed dog that plays a maddening version of “Pop Goes the Weasel” whenever it’s squeezed. And that’s all before the titular “monster” finally shows up. Regardless, <i>The Monster</i> ultimately feels like a film reaching desperately for profundity and missing by a country mile, notable only for solid performances by Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

      <p><b>49. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80199689">Velvet Buzzsaw</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2018<br/><b>Director:</b> Dan Gilroy<br/>With 2014’s chilling <i>Nightcrawler</i>, writer/director Dan Gilroy and stars <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jake+Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> and Rene Russo created a potent critique of the media’s “if it bleeds, it leads” mentality. Four years later, the same team is back with <i>Velvet Buzzsaw</i> in order to ostensibly skewer the shallowness and materialism of art profiteering, told through a gaudy blend of pretentious B-horror and on-the-nose satire. <i>Nightcrawler</i>’s solidly structured and thematically laser-focused existence makes <i>Velvet Buzzsaw</i> that much of a baffling experience, since what we get from Gilroy here is the exact opposite: A muddled, morally confused and, worst of all, woefully predictable genre rethread with a laughably transparent art house veneer. Hidden underneath Gyllenhaal and Russo’s scenery-chewing cartoon versions of highfalutin art expert types, the premise of a mysterious collection of apparently haunted paintings killing all those who try to profit from it presents not much more than a typical slasher flick. Whenever a character is left alone every 20 minutes or so, you can bet they’ll be toast or mince meat—in one case literally—by the time the scene’s over. One can expect such a flimsy narrative used solely to prop up a series of exuberantly gory set-pieces from a medium-grade giallo auteur of the ’70s, but more cohesive work is expected from the likes of Gilroy and his powerful cast. If you’re a horror fan who’s in it only for the blood, go for it. Other buyers, beware. —<i>Oktay Ege Kozak</i></p>

      <p><b>48. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80094648">I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2016<br/><b>Director:</b> Osgood Perkins<br/>This somewhat labored ghost story premiered at the Toronto International Film Fest before being picked up by <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> for distribution, but the festival circuit is really its natural home. A staid, extremely patient haunted house yarn with some intriguing performances, it’s likely to be too slow to be appreciated by bingers on the streaming service. A woman (Ruth Wilson) moves into a creaky old home to serve as live-in nurse for an elderly horror author with dementia (Paula Prentiss), but soon finds herself sucked into the ghost story that makes up the author’s most famous book. Which sounds like a fairly conventional horror movie premise, but it’s the delivery that sets this film apart rather than the summation. Every shot lingers. We glide through the house with minimal, whispered dialogue and occasional narration, and although it does build a palpable sense of unease, the payoffs are few and far between. I couldn’t help but be reminded of H.P. Mendoza’s similarly experimental 2012 film <i>I Am a Ghost</i>, which is equally laconic but more visually arresting. <i>I Am the Pretty Thing</i> has grand artistic aspirations of some kind behind it, but has trouble giving them vibrancy. This is a horror film for audiences with solid attention spans. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

That’s Elle Callahan’s <i>Head Count</i>, a film with a dreamlike tone slowly overridden by an inexplicable nightmare. When a gaggle of 20-somethings get together at Joshua Tree for a mini vacation, they do what characters so frequently do in horror movies: Read a spooky story that accidentally summons a monster. In this case the monster is the Hisji, a shape-shifting entity that breaks prey psychologically before the killing begins. Accordingly, Callahan relishes the mental component of <i>Head Count</i>’s basic conceit, allowing the cast to slowly give in to suspicion and distrust while capitalizing on their collective uncertainty. At every turn, Callahan creates opportunities to scare the crap out of her audience, often in broad daylight or a well-illuminated room, where the viewer leasts expect to be terrified. The film violates safety and sanctuary on the strength of Callahan’s shrewd filmmaking. There’s room for improvement—the monster ultimately has too much origin for its own good—but <i>Head Count</i> is self-assured in its craftsmanship and announces Callahan as a director with promise and perspective. <i>—Andy Crump</i></p>

      <p><b>46. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=murder%20party&amp;jbv=70077076&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0">Murder Party</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2007<br/><b>Director:</b> Jeremy Saulnier<br/>Streaming services are the obvious home for extremely low-budget, indie horror farces like <i>Murder Party</i>, which would likely never see the light of day otherwise—even as the feature film debut of Jeremy Saulnier, who went on to direct <i>Blue Ruin</i> and <i>Green Room</i>. This is a breezy, amiable horror comedy that feels like a guy and his friends getting together to scrape together a credit on their collective resumes, but with results that transcend the nonexistent budget. Our protagonist is Chris, a rather pathetic and lonely man who has nothing to do for Halloween, until he finds a mysterious flyer for a “murder party” happening in his city. Little does he know, the name is no exaggeration—the event is being hosted by a group of outsider artists who intend to murder anyone who shows up. This story could theoretically be played straight, but the tone is instead very much in the camp of something like Eli Craig’s <i>Tucker and Dale vs. Evil</i>, despite the fact that <i>Murder Party</i> predates that film. As the artists bicker and argue about how to kill Chris, the captive breaks free, beginning a series of zany, gory mishaps that decimate his captors. Featuring surprisingly effective and gross blood effects—it seems like the entire budget was spent here, and you can hardly say their priorities were in the wrong place—<i>Murder Party</i> is a lightweight 80 minutes you’re unlikely to regret if you enjoy horror comedy. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

      <p><b>45. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=shutter&amp;jbv=70062814&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0">Shutter</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2004<br/><b>Directors:</b> Bangjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom<br/>Right around the same time when the American horror film market was excitedly green-lighting remakes of Japanese horror films such as <i>The Ring</i> and <i>The Grudge</i>, Thailand produced what is likely its largest genre hit to date, <i>Shutter</i>. This is an uncomplicated, old-school kind of haunting story that is given a modern twist in its reveal of the connection between victim and tormenter—themes that are handled more fluidly here than in the overly dramaticized 2008 American remake of the same name. It thrives on the strength of its two central performances, particularly that of Ananda Everingham, who plays a man whose sins come back to revisit him, big-time. The final nature of his personal haunting is captured on a screen in a way that is both scary and familiar feeling, with an “urban legend”-like quality that sounds like it would make for a perfect campfire story. With that ending in particular, it’s little wonder that the American remake followed, but the Thai original more accurately conveys the film’s eventual tone of social criticism. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

Originally titled <i>Somnia</i>, the film was passed to several potential distributors, and even had in-theater advertising at one point, but its plans for a theatrical release were ultimately scrapped. The story of a young boy (Jacob Tremblay of <i>Room</i> and <i>Wonder</i>) with the unconscious power to manifest his dreams in reality, it draws obvious parallels to <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>, but especially to the astral plane-tripping excursions of the <i>Insidious</i> series, without quite having the verve of either. Still, it could be an interesting genre footnote in the career of Tremblay if this kid grows up to be an Oscar-winner someday. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

Not long after her funeral, he starts to notice some unusual occurrences around town—strange things are afoot at the Circle-K—and Zach discovers that Beth has risen from the grave.

      <p><b>42. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=terrifier&amp;jbv=81004223&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0">Terrifier</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2016<br/><b>Director:</b> Damien Leone<br/>It’s really no easy feat to put together a modern slasher movie with retro inspiration, walking the delicate line between genre parody and loving homage. Too many have tried exactly this and ended up with a result that spends all its time winking at genre tropes, rather than simply delivering the goods. <i>Terrifier</i> is one of the few that at least partially works in the spirit in which it was intended, thanks to its depraved attitude, stylish bloodletting and key central performance. This movie hinges entirely around the quality of David Howard Thornton’s performance as “Art the Clown,” elevating it from what could be perceived as simply a riff on <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Stephen+King">Stephen King</a>’s <i>It</i> to a genuine genre effort of merit. Much of that just boils down to Thornton’s terrific facial expressions as Art, and his stellar costuming and design—he is tailor made to be a recurring slasher film character, and had this series first cropped up in 1982, we probably would have seen half a dozen Art the Clown sequels. The rest of the production is on the cheap side—it often feels like they’re going for the degraded film stock look of Tarantino’s <i>Death Proof</i>, but can’t quite pull it off—but there’s enough gore to satisfy any horror fan’s hunger. If killer clowns are your thing, it’s essential. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

      <p><b>41. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=the%20perfection&amp;jbv=80211638&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0">The Perfection</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2019<br/><b>Director:</b> Richard Shepard<br/>What should <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/horror+movies">horror movies</a> be judged by? Airtight narrative logic, or imaginatively deranged imagery? Scores matter, scripts matter, but by the end of the movie what tends to matter most are the visuals, and Richard Shepard’s new movie, <i>The Perfection</i>, sears its visuals into the viewer’s mind like branding on livestock, right up to its final shot, one of the genre’s most indelible since horror became the taste of the day in the mid 2010s. It’s a twisted kind of miracle that anyone who watches <i>The Perfection</i> will never be the same, and a testament to horror’s power to bend minds and spur nightmares with a single picture. But the movie also reminds us that as much as pictures often come first, plotting usually should come a very close second. The film begins promisingly enough: After abandoning her career to care for her dying mother, cello prodigy Charlotte (Allison Williams) returns to the music world to reclaim her standing as the Bachoff Academy of Music’s star pupil, which means sabotaging the current title holder, Lizzie (Logan Browning). Charlotte reaches out to her old teachers, Anton (Steven Weber) and Paloma (Alaina Huffman), travels to Shanghai as Bachoff selects its latest student, and cozies up to Lizzie. They flatter each other. They flirt. They drink, go partying, then make passionate love in a hotel, filmed with cinematographer Vanja Cernul’s lurid gaze. Maybe Charlotte bears Lizzie no grudge. Maybe they really do admire each other to romantic heights. And then they travel to rural China, where Lizzie grows increasingly sick, starts puking up bugs, discovers yet more bugs dithering about under the skin on her arm, and, when offered a butcher’s cleaver by Charlotte, chops off her hand. This is the climax to <i>The Perfection</i>’s first half hour, ruined by a single viewing of the trailer. It’s also where Shepard springs the first of several fakeouts, stealing a page from Michael Haneke’s playbook. At its best, <i>The Perfection</i> is an homage to 1970s <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/horror+movies">horror movies</a> and 1980s thrillers, a glorious, multi-hewed mind screw. When Shepard sticks to this aesthetic, the movie soars on grotesque wings. When he commits the cardinal sin of demystifying the mysterious, it’s a major drag. A little ambiguity goes a long, long way in horror. —<i>Andy Crump</i></p>

Mother has provided an idyllic upbringing for the girl, who represents the hope for humanity with thousands more embryos ready to become her little brothers and sisters. She learns everything from engineering to medicine to ethics (that latter subject key to the questions the film will eventually raise).Grant Sputore’s Australian/American production is constructed around plot twists as much as characters, and although some of them are exactly what any sci-fi fan was probably expecting, there’s enough original thought to keep the tension level high. Everything Daughter knows is thrown into question by the arrival of a nameless woman (Hilary Swank) whose description of the outside world doesn’t match Mother’s. (There’s definitely a little <i>10 Cloverfield Lane</i> going on here.) Daughter must balance her loyalty to Mother, to her future siblings and to her species, all while trying to uncover the truth. —<i>Josh Jackson</i></p>

It at least aims to close the series (until it was reanimated in 2011’s <i>Scream 4</i>) with a deeper bit of context into what kicked off the events of the first film, but it does so in a way that lacks the subtlety of either previous installment—seemingly every reviewer felt it necessary to point out that “<i>Scream</i> has become the thing it was originally parodying.” Neve Campbell is resourceful as ever as ultimate final girl Sidney Prescott, but it’s the supporting cast that has now worn thin—even with a visit (via video) from dead horror geek Randy Meeks, who informs the cast of the tenants surrounding a horror trilogy. Still, for the horror completionist, its ending provides a worthwhile sense of closure for Sidney. The fourth film, unsurprisingly, remains unnecessary as a result. -<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

It was an early starring vehicle for Amber Heard, who is appealing as the “sweet young thing” considerably more twisted than meets the eye. The film veers away from classical slasher in the sense that the kills are more on the realistic side than the cartoonish, although the latter might actually have made it more memorable. As is, there’s nothing particularly wrong here—a certain lack of unique ideas, certainly, but a competently executed high school horror story that will feel comfortably familiar, right down to its third act twist.

His films defy easy description, as anyone who watched <i>I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House</i> on <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> could attest. <i>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</i>, meanwhile, was completed and exhibited as early as 2015 under the title <i>February</i>, but has been floating around in limbo ever since until A24 decided to finally give it a limited release this spring. Compared with <i>Pretty Thing</i>, <i>Blackcoat’s Daughter</i> is at least easier to grasp and marginally brisker, which makes it more effective overall. Perkins’ style is languid, atmospheric and deliberate, favoring repetition and a slowly multiplying sense of unease and impending doom. The story follows two high school-aged students who are both left relatively alone at their uptight Catholic boarding school over break when their parents fail to pick them up. As one descends into what is implied to be either madness or demonic possession, the events are interwoven with another story about a young woman journeying on the road in the direction of the boarding school. The two stories inevitably intertwine. The film’s pace sometimes leaves something to be desired, but patience is largely repaid by its final third, which contains several moments genuinely disturbing in their violence and transgressive imagery. In the end, <i>The Blackcoat’s Daughter</i> comes together significantly more neatly and logically than one might consider while watching its first hour, rewarding careful attention to detail throughout. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

      <p><b>36. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70270388">Would You Rather</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2012<br/><b>Director:</b> David Guy Levy<br/><i>Would You Rather</i> is the kind of reductive horror film that follows in the wake of the <i>Saw</i> and <i>Hostel</i> generation of the 2000s, where characterization is just an excuse to reduce each character to one driving motivation. Here’s our protagonist—oh, she needs money to pay for the treatment of her sick brother, but what will she do to get it? Films like this are careful to not present any of the other characters as equally or more sincere in their desire than that protagonist, because that would introduce real moral ambiguity rather than the illusive choices here. Regardless, you’re not watching for the story—you’re watching to see what a bunch of strangers will be forced to do to each other in order to win a demented millionaire’s payday. ’80s horror icon Jeffrey Combs plays that villain, and although he’s clearly having a good time, there’s some spark of vitality to his performances in <i>Re-Animator</i> or <i>From Beyond</i> that has long since been reduced to paycheck-minded professionalism or self-parody. If this movie had been made in 1985, perhaps it would have been a minor classic. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

      <p><b>35. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70307661">As Above, So Below</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2014<br/><b>Director:</b> John Erick Dowdle<br/>In the wake of <i>Paranormal Activity</i>, “found footage” as a horror sub-genre had a pretty tough time getting a fair shake from critics, and often from audiences as well. It’s not as if it wasn’t often warranted—anyone who remembers the likes of <i>Apollo 18</i> can attest to that. Unfortunately, though, it often meant that even found footage movies with more ambition or verve than typical, such as <i>Grave Encounters</i> or <i>As Above, So Below</i>, went overlooked. This one gets by on high concept more than anything else: A camera crew descends into the legendary catacombs beneath Paris, but finds much more there than bargained for. One might expect such a story to involve mutants, or marauders, but <i>As Above, So Below</i> is considerably more cerebral—instead, the story unfolds as a metaphysical descent into hell with numerous parallels to Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>, the crew confronting various sins and failings. Even the jump scares are solid; in an era when shoddy found footage movies were being churned out en masse, <i>As Above, So Below</i> hardly deserves to be lumped in among its more forgettable peers. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

An obvious parody of <i>The Omen</i> and other “evil kid” movies, <i>Little Evil</i> wears its influences and references on its sleeve in ways that, while not particularly clever, are at least loving. <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Adam+Scott">Adam Scott</a> is the sad-sack father who somehow became swept up in a whirlwind romance and marriage, all while being unfazed by the fact that his new step-son is the kind of kid who dresses like a pint-sized Angus Young and trails catastrophes behind him wherever he goes. Evangeline Lilly is the boy’s foxy mother, whose motivations are suspect throughout. Does she know that her child is the spawn of Satan, or as his mother is she just willfully blind to the obvious evil growing under her nose? The film can boast a pretty impressive supporting cast, from Donald Faison and Chris D’elia as fellow step-dads, to Clancy Brown as a fire-and-brimstone preacher, but never does it fully commit toward either its jokes or attempts to frighten. The final 30 minutes are the most interesting, leading the plot in an unexpected direction that redefines the audience’s perception of the demon child, but it still makes for a somewhat uneven execution. <i>Tucker &amp; Dale</i> this is not, but it’s still a serviceable return for Craig. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

      <p><b>33. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80135164">1922</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2017<br/><b>Director:</b> Zak Hilditch<br/>A chameleonic performance from Thomas Jane anchors this understated, gothic story set in Depression-era Middle America, told in the style of a confession by the husband (who we can tell right from the get-go is haunted by some horrible crime). When his wife (Molly Parker) insists on selling the land she’s inherited rather than work it, Jane’s unsophisticated field hand harangues their son (Dylan Schmid) into becoming an accomplice in her grisly murder. As with every Grand Guignol tale, though, we already know that the worst part isn’t the act of killing, but the endless paranoia of living with it. In the case of the movie’s guilty narrator, that means a vengeful and inevitable haunting filled with all the foreboding and creepy imagery you came to see. <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Stephen+King">Stephen King</a> adaptations have their hits and their misses, but this is a straightforward story that gets by on the power of a dread-steeped plot and some compelling performances by good character actors you’ll most likely always be happy to see get screen time. —<i>Kenneth Lowe</i></p>

      <p><b>32. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80199767">Cult of Chucky</a></b> <br/><b>Year:</b> 2017<br/><b>Director:</b> Don Mancini<br/>The <i>Child’s Play</i> series has managed the supremely rare accomplishment of actually improving itself in its direct-to-video era, clawing its way up from the abyss that was the <i>Seed of Chucky</i> days with its last two installments, <i>Curse</i> and <i>Cult of Chucky</i>. This latest, the seventh in the series, is possibly the best since <i>Child’s Play 2</i>, weaving together a complex web of characters from the history of the series. The voodoo mumbo-jumbo at the heart of the plot has gotten more fiendishly complicated than ever, resulting in not one but a small army of Chucky dolls, each containing the soul of Brad Dourif’s iconic serial killer, Charles Lee Ray. Stark and futuristic-feeling, the film is set in a brilliantly white-toned mental health institution, where recovering hero Nica (Dourif’s daughter, Fiona Dourif) must grapple with the legacy of Chucky, while also bringing original hero Andy Barclay back into the fold. This <i>Chucky</i> is certainly a return to the original film in many respects, especially in its depraved attitude and copious amounts of gore. And unlike <i>Curse of Chucky</i>, most of the FX are rendered practically, to boot. Ultimately, <i>Cult</i> is a far better entry than you could ever hope for in the seventh film of a horror franchise, and it should be commended for that. Don Mancini never says “die” with this series, it would seem. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

A spirit/demonic possession movie in the vein of <i>Witchboard</i>, the film follows a 15-year-old Spanish student (Sandra Escacena) who unwittingly invites evil into her home while conducting a ouija seance with her school chums. Where the movie shines best is largely on the presentation side: It looks great whenever its images aren’t too dark, capturing an interesting moment in history by setting the film in 1991 Spain. Charismatic performances from multiple child actors serve to bolster a story that unfortunately feels frustratingly familiar, recycling elements of <i>Ouija</i>, <i>The Last Exorcism</i> and practically every possession film ever written. This is very well-trodden ground, but <i>Verónica</i> is at the very least more than competent, even if it’s not the revelation for which we were hoping from the director. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

With twists care of <i>Fright Night</i> and <i>Night of the Demons</i>, it’s at its best not when trying to slavishly recreate a past decade, but when letting its hyper-charismatic teenage characters run wild. Stylish, gory and profane to a fault, <i>The Babysitter</i> features a handful of bang-up performances, like Judah Lewis as a late-blooming 12-year-old, Robbie Amell as a nigh-invincible football jock and Samara Weaving as the title character, the girl of Lewis’s dreams—right up until she tries to sacrifice him to the devil. Fast-moving (only 85 minutes!) and frequently hilarious, it’s probably the best unit of popcorn horror entertainment that <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> has managed to put out so far. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>

It’s a film that benefits from an audience’s low expectations for its complexity—the viewer goes in assuming that they’re seeing the same basic haunting/possession/poltergeist-type story they’ve seen before, and Wan then dazzles them with a mythos that is considerably more detailed (and batshit) than what they expected to receive. So too does the film benefit from a few key performances, whether that’s Patrick Wilson as the anxious father (and secret font of psychic energy) searching for his son, or the utterly essential Lin Shaye as the knowledgeable demonologist who is the family’s only hope. The near-starring role of Shaye really is something worth acknowledging, as the presence of older women as stars/protagonists in the horror genre is close to nonexistent—the <i>Insidious</i> series managed the odd task of taking a character who was in the supporting role of Zelda Rubinstein in <i>Poltergeist</i> and somehow turning her into the legitimate hero of the franchise. Today, the film still holds up well enough, undone a bit by its sequels’ insistence on constant canonical retconning, but featuring jump scares (especially that red-faced demon) that are as effective as anything in their era. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

Regardless, this is a competently crafted little drama thriller for the zombie completist, full of excellent performances from no-name actors and an intriguing take on the results of zombification. The infected here at times seem like your standard Romero ghouls, but they’re also a bit more: lost souls who have hung onto some kind of strange, rudimentary culture all their own. These aspects of the zombie plague are always hinted at, never extrapolated, but it enhances the profound feelings of loss and sadness present in <i>Ravenous</i>. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

Not among the general audience, where the film is still fairly well-liked, but among the horror and zombie geeks and “purists,” who don’t seem to consider it legitimate enough as a zombie film. I’m not sure why that is, in a genre where <i>Shaun of the Dead</i> is rightly hailed as the cream of the zombie comedy crop. <i>Zombieland</i> was certainly inspired on some level by the former, as it moved the action to the USA and brought together survivors who were anonymous to each other rather than a circle of friends, as in the tradition of <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>. <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jesse+Eisenberg">Jesse Eisenberg</a>’s Columbus is the type of character we hadn’t seen in a zombie film before, even in the comedies—somewhat neurotic, not particularly well-equipped to fight, but brainy and resourceful enough to get by on his own, he presents an entirely different mold of survivor. Of course it’s Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee who really steals the show, as a short-fused drifter on a seemingly pointless quest to find the world’s last box of Twinkies. Featuring zombies that are legitimately threatening, it tows a near-perfect line between comedic (but gory) violence and character-driven humor. —<i>Jim Vorel</i></p>

Luke (Rafe Spall) is the member of the group who shoulders the greatest burden of guilt, being the only one who was in the store at the time, paralyzed with indecision and cowardice while he watched his friend die. The other members clearly blame Luke for this to varying degrees, and one senses that their decision to journey to Sweden for a hiking trip deep into the wilderness is less to honor their dead friend’s memory, and more to determine if their bond can ever be repaired, or whether the recrimination stemming from the death is insurmountable. Where <i>The Ritual</i> excels is technically, in both its imagery and sound design. Cinematographer Andrew Shulkind’s crisp images and deep focus are a welcome respite from the overly dark, muddy look of so many modern horror films with similar settings (such as Bryan Bertino’s <i>The Monster</i>), and the forested location shots, regardless of where they may have been filmed, are uniformly stunning. Numerous shots of tree clusters evoke Celtic knot-like imagery, these dense puzzles of foliage clearly hiding dire secrets, and we are shown just enough through the film’s first two thirds to keep the mystery palpable and engaging. Director David Bruckner, who is best known for directing well-regarded segments of horror anthologies such as <i>V/H/S</i>, <i>The Signal</i> and <i>Southbound</i>, demonstrates a talent here for suggestion and subtlety, aided by some excellent sound design that emphasizes every rustling leaf and creaking tree branch. Unfortunately, the characters are a bit thin for what is meant to be a character-driven film, and the big payoff can’t quite maintain the atmosphere of the film’s first two acts. Still, <i>The Ritual</i> is a great-looking film, and one that features one of the more memorably “WTF!” monster designs in recent memory. It’s worth a look for that alone. <i>—Jim Vorel</i></p>
