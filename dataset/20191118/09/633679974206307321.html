      <p>Actress Charlize Theron has said she wants to find love again and be in a relationship but she won't ever "compromise" anything in her life to please a man.</p>
      <p>"I'd love to meet somebody and that is something I even think can happen. I'm just not willing to compromise if something doesn't feel right. That's something that has definitely changed for me after I got to my forties, Theron told HELLO! magazine, reports femaelfirst.co.uk.</p>
      <p>She added: "I think a huge part of my relationships in the past have been about me being hyper-aware that there was an element to me that was threatening to people."</p>
      <p>The actress says in her 20s she had the need to modulated herself, depending on the relationship.</p>
      <p>"I remember a lot of times thinking, 'If I could just make myself smaller, then this relationship would be perfect.' But the older I get the more I've come to realise that doing that is just not being true to me," she said.</p>
      <p>Theron previously dated Sean Penn, whom she began romancing in late 2013 and they announced their engagement in December 2014, however, they eventually split around six months later in 2015.</p>
      <p>Prior to Penn, the actress had a long-term relationship with actor Stuart Townsend, after they met of the set of the 2002 movie "Trapped", before calling time on their romance in January 2010.</p>
      <p>Rather change anything about herself, Theron, who has two adopted children, August and Jackson, hopes that she will meet a man who loves her for who she is.</p>
