        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 18 – An Air Force Major arraigned in court on Monday over the murder of his wife and two children will be held in police custody for another 21 days pending the conclusion of a probe on the murder.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Nanyuki court allowed the prosecutions request after State Prosecutor Peter Mailanyi said he was not ready to prefer charges yet.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Major Peter Mugure was arrested after detectives recovered the bodies of his estranged wife Joyce Syombua (31), children Shanice Maua (10) and Prince Michael (5) at a cemetery in Thingithu area near the Laikipia Air Base on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Directorate of Criminal Investigations’ (DCI) Serious Crimes Unit which is leading the probe indicated the bodies had been pilled on top of each other inside a shallow grave.</p>
      <p>The accused air force officer is said to have hosted the three at the Laikipia Air Base where they stayed before departing for Nairobi where they lived.</p>
      <p>Collins Pamba, a 21-year-old worker at the senior officer’s mess within the military base led detectives to the cemetery where the bodies of the three victims were exhumed.</p>
      <p>Major Mugure was arrested on Friday, 20 days after his wife and children went missing and just a day before their bodies were discovered.</p>
      <p>Syombua the children disappeared on October 25 after visiting Major Mugure in Nanyuki.</p>
      <p>The air force officer had previously been ordered to pay maintenance costs for his two children after a DNA test to establish his paternity turned positive.</p>
