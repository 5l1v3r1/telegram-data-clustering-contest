      <h1>Unreleased Version of 1994 Sega Game 'Sonic The Hedgehog 3' Found</h1>
      <h2>An early blueprint of the iconic title.</h2>

      <p>An unreleased version of the 1994 game classic <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic The Hedgehog 3</a></i> has been unearthed. It’s an early preview build of the original game which, according to the finders, is dramatically different. As a refresher, <i>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</i> follows <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/sonic">Sonic</a> and Tails’ journey through a series of obstacles to stop Doctor Robotnik from launching his Death Egg and taking over the world, a similar premise to the upcoming film <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/sonic-the-hedgehog-second-trailer-paramount-pictures-stream">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Despite being one of the best selling <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Sega-Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> games ever made, <i>Sonic The Hedgehog 3</i> struggled greatly in its development. The project started in January 1993 with a tight deadline of February 1994, kicked off with the concept of isometric 3D, which incorporates the Sega Virtua Processor chip that enables 3D graphics. The prototype was made with the title <i>Sonic 3D</i> but it was halted after it was realized the game would not make the deadline. There was also game music that <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/michael-jackson">Michael Jackson</a> submitted, only to be scrapped mid-way through development as the infamous first allegations against him went public. So the Sega team started over from scratch. They rushed and later turned it into the more conventional, yet iconic, 2D game that we all love and remember.</p>
      <p>Because of its complex development, the early stages of the game were never really previewed. There was only one copy of a preview that was sent out, via Britain’s Sega Magazine, for coverage, and that code, miraculously, has just been found. According to sources, the game is packed full of alternate changes, like different music, different levels and even a different move called “drop dash.” Specifically, levels like Flying Battery Zone are present, alongside Carnival Night Zone and Lava Reef Zone, which can only be accessed through hacking. For those curious and eager to play, the preview code for the game is currently available for download.</p>
