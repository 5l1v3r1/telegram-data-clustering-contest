      <p>CUTTING OLD &amp; RARE TREES TO BUILD BRIDGE</p>
      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI: </b>City residents have decided to intensify their protests in case Dispur goes ahead with its move to cut hundreds of old trees for the purpose of constructing a bridge to connect Guwahati with North Guwahati.</p>
      <p>Residents of Machkhowa, Bharalumukh, Shantipur, Uzan Bazar and other important localities are enraged that nearly 300 trees will be felled, most of which stand tall at the Sankardev Park and Ajan Peer Park along MG Road in the city. The approach road to the proposed bridge will pass through both the parks that face the Brahmaputra river.</p>
      <p>“We have already submitted a memorandum to PWD minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and the Kamrup (Metropolitan) district administration voicing our strong opposition against the government’s move. Residents are hopeful that the government will sit together with them and find out an alternative plan to construct the proposed bridge without cutting trees. If the government remains adamant and goes ahead with its existing plan of cutting trees, we will have to intensify our protests,” a senior resident of Bharalumukh said.</p>
      <p>Another resident said some trees at the Sankardev Park are over 100-year-old and rare. The trees are also home to various bird species. “If these trees are felled, where will the birds go? It will be another big blow towards maintaining a healthy and balanced ecology,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In the whole of west Guwahati, there are just two parks— Sankardev Udyan and Ajan Peer park . If these parks destroyed, where will senior citizens like me go? We want development but it should not be at the cost of nature,” another resident said.</p>
