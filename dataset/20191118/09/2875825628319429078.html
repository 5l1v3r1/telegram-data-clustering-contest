      <h1>Unwanted Arsenal flop Mohamed Elneny rejected by AC Milan as he seeks transfer</h1>
      <h2>Elneny has been farmed out on loan to Besiktas by Arsenal and his prospects over a long-term future at the Emirates look bleak - but Milan are not interested</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:43:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Mohamed Elneny has reportedly approached AC Milan over a transfer - only for the Italian giants to reject him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> flop Elneny is curerntly on loan at Besiktas with his prospects of a long-term future at the Emirates looking increasingly bleak.</p>
      <p>And, according to reports in Italy, he and an intermediary suggested to Milan that he would be an interesting option for the Rossoneri in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>But Milan chiefs are said to have taken a dim view of the 27-year-old's offer, believing he would be low down the pecking order of midfield options at the San Siro.</p>

      <p>Elneny arrived at Arsenal from FC Basel in January 2016 for a fee in the region of Â£7million.</p>
      <p>He played 16 times in all competitions in the second half of that season and managed 73 more outings in the next three campaigns before being farmed out to Besiktas, scoring twice overall.</p>
      <p>The 77-cap Egypt international was part of the Gunners' 2016-17 FA Cup winning squad and he helped the north Londoners to the Europa League final last term, only for Arsenal to lose to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>Internationally, Elneny tasted heartbreak with Egypt as they were beaten by Cameroon in the Africa Cup of Nations final in 2017.</p>
