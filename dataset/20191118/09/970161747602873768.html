        <b>Ariana Grande has taken extreme measures to overcome her nasty illness, by hooking herself up to a vitamin IV drip hours after cancelling her latest Sweetener tour show.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Thank U, Next singer has been battling a mystery illness since August and it got the best of her this weekend, prompting her to scrap her performance at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>In a tearful Instagram video, Ari told her followers: ‘It hurts so bad to swallow.</p>
      <p>‘I unfortunately don’t think I’ll be able to push through tonight, and I’m so … sorry.’</p>
      <p>Bless her heart.</p>
      <p>Fans and Ari’s celebrity peers have been equally concerned about her wellbeing, including Barbra Streisand who tweeted some suggestions for the singer to overcome the illness once and for all.</p>
      <p>‘Take a strong Vitamin C drink with some Manuka honey and of course get some chicken soup! Bx,’ Barbra told the popstar.</p>

      <p>Ari was a little starstruck by the iconic singer’s kind tweet and replied: ‘My goodness. love you so so much. thank you my sweetest.’</p>

      <p>Barbra wasn’t the only celebrity dishing out advice for Ari as British singer FKA twigs provided a soup recipe.</p>
      <p>‘Love you, sweet caring angel @fkatwigs this recipe is the one,’ Ariana wrote alongside a clip of her stirring the pot.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old then cosied up in bed to binge on episodes of Gossip Girl.</p>
      <p>Sounds like the perfect evening to us – nasty colds aside, of course.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/ariana-grande-warns-fans-may-cancel-tour-shows-much-pain-amid-health-battles-11169125/">the 7 Rings hitmaker warned fans</a> that there was a chance she’d have to cancel her next concert, revealing her head was ‘splitting’ while performing in Charlottesville the night before.</p>
      <p>Ariana explained: ‘So I’m still very sick. I’ve been sick since the last London show. I don’t know how it’s possible but my throat and head are still in so much pain.</p>
      <p>‘I sound okay I’m just in a lot of pain and it’s difficult to breathe during the show. I am seeing my doctor and trying my v vest to get better for tomorrow’s show.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘Please take this as a gentle heads up…</p>
      <p>‘I don’t want anyone to feel blindsided tomorrow if God forbid I can’t make the show happen. ‘I’m on all the meds. Getting IV drips, doing everything I possibly can to pull through. Mum and friends are taking good care of me. Just a scary feeling.’</p>
