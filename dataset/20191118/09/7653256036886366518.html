      <p>Niti Aayog, government's premier think-tank, has laid out a comprehensive roadmap to improve India's <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/health-system">health system</a> with a focus on delivery of the unfinished public health agenda, change the health financing way from out of pocket to large insurers, integrate service delivery, empower citizens to become better buyers of health and harness the power of digital health.</p>
      <p>The roadmap has been outlined in a book titled New India: Building Blocks - Potential Pathways to Reforms released on Monday. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NITI-Aayog">NITI Aayog</a> vice chairman Rajiv Kumar released the book in the presence of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>, co-chairman of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and representatives from national and international academia.</p>
      <p>The book, which is a synthesis of all the discussions and efforts initiated at the national-level workshop held last year, could form the basis of the way forward for the health sector in the upcoming Vision Document of the Aayog in 2020.</p>
      <p>The book reveals India’s health system as a story of multiple fragmentations at the level of payers and risk pools, healthcare services and at digital backbone running it, the Aayog said.</p>
      <p>The book integrates viewpoints on the concerted efforts required for strengthening the existing fractured health system to meet the challenges that lie ahead of the nation.</p>
      <p>The book is based on the data collected and provided by ACCESS Health International for the public sector and by PWC India for private sector.</p>
      <p>NITI Aayog aims to facilitate multi-sectoral and stakeholder conversations on a systemic approach to reforming healthcare in India, looking at interlinked changes across the multiple building blocks of its health system.</p>
