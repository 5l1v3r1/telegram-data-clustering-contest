      <p>The 21-year-old from Athens came of age at London's O2 Arena, becoming became the youngest winner of the prestigious season-ending tournament since <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lleyton-hewitt/"><b>Lleyton Hewitt</b></a> in 2001, and the youngest debutant to lift the trophy since <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-mcenroe/"><b>John McEnroe</b></a> back in 1978.</p>
      <p>Just a year after winning the NextGen Finals, for players of 21 and under, Tsitsipas mixed it with the very best on the bank of the Thames and came out on top.</p>

      <p>Congratulated by his country's prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis after his semi-final win over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roger-federer/"><b>Roger Federer</b></a>, Tsitsipas went on to write his name in Greek sporting history with a 6-7 (6) 6-2 7-6 (4) victory.</p>
      <p>It was only the third time in 16 years that the final did not feature at least one of the 'big three', <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rafael-nadal/"><b>Rafael Nadal</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/novak-djokovic/"><b>Novak Djokovic</b></a> or Federer, and further evidence surely that the long-awaited power shift in men's tennis is finally on the way.</p>
      <p>At 26 Thiem is just about part of that youthful scene as well, and his notable wins over Federer and Djokovic this week helped him climb to fourth in the world.</p>
      <p>But the final belonged to Tsitsipas and the legions of Greek fans who made the 02 feel like a home from home for the new champion.</p>

      <p>He said: "It's been a rollercoaster. It's a dream come true and the best way to end this match.</p>
      <p>"My fighting spirit and me constantly trying to push myself to do better got me there in the end.</p>
      <p>"Things were great this year and I beat some top-ranked players which gave me confidence, and I've won matches in grand slams and Masters 1000s. I think I can do well in the slams.</p>
      <p>"I feel like my game is getting better over time, and I believe I'm really close on being crowned a grand slam champion. I know these are strong words that I say, but I do feel like I belong there."</p>

      <p>The two players are close friends on the Tour –  Tsitsipas even acted as Thiem's hitting partner at the tournament in 2016 – and they embraced at end of a gruelling encounter.</p>
      <p>A nip-and-tuck first set went to a tie-break, and when the score reached 7-6 each player had won 44 points. But crucially, Thiem had the ball in his hand and an unreturnable first serve clinched the opening set.</p>
      <p>Yet if that was tight, the second was a walkover as Tsitsipas broke twice, raced into a 4-0 lead and confidently served it out.</p>
      <p>The first set had taken over an hour, the second lasted 26 minutes in a blur of shaggy hair and flamboyant shot-making, and all Thiem's good work had unravelled.</p>

      <p>When Thiem netted a backhand Tsitsipas had an early break in the decider, but the Greek began bearing gifts and three wayward backhands allowed Thiem to draw level.</p>
      <p>But it was a horrible, wafted forehand from Thiem which handed Tsitsipas the initiative in the deciding tie-break, and a memorable victory was wrapped up in two hours and 34 minutes.</p>
      <p>Thiem said: "It's always going to be like that in tennis. That's why it's probably mentally the most brutal sport existing because you can play such a great match and end up losing in the championship match.</p>
      <p>"From that point of view, it's a very disappointing loss, very hard to digest. But I had some amazing wins also, even this week, that got me in this situation even to play at the Finals. So it's fine."</p>
