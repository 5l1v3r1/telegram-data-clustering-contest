      <h1>Pumped Storage Hydro proposed for Zimbabwe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:12:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.esi-africa.com/author/babalwa-c/" target="_blank">Babalwa Bungane</a></address>

        <b>Swedish owned Ngonyezi Projects has entered into a non-consumptive water use agreement with Zimbabwe National Water Authority.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The purpose of the agreement is to install a combination of 2,000MWh Pumped Storage Hydro (PSH) and 300MW solar PV.</p>
      <p>The location of the installation is Osborne Dam on the Odzi river in Manicaland Province.</p>
      <p>Storage is an essential part of a renewable energy strategy and it is recommended that 30% of the installed solar PV should be supported by <a href="https://www.esi-africa.com/tag/energy-storage/">storage</a>, says Tomas Persson, initiator of the project.</p>

      <p>Ngonyezi Projects notes that in <a href="https://www.esi-africa.com/tag/zimbabwe/">Zimbabwe</a> there is average 8.5h peak price per day.</p>
      <p>In terms of the design, the project is anticipated that a 300MW solar PV will require 500 ha of surface of dam, for solar panels.</p>
      <p>The dam water will cool the panels, which gives higher efficiency and the panels covering the surface water reduces algae growth and evaporation – less 20 million m3/y of evaporation</p>

      <p>PSH currently dominates total installed storage power capacity, with 96% of the total of 176GW installed globally in mid-2017.</p>
      <p>The other electricity storage technologies already in significant use around the world include thermal storage, with 3.3GW (1.9%); batteries, with 1.9GW (1.1%) and other mechanical storage with 1.6GW (0.9%).</p>
