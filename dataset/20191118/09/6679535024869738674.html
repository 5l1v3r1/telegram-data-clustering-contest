      <h2>Opposition calls it ‘illegal’, demands National Conference leader’s release</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:27:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sandeep-Phukan-11373/" target="_blank">Sandeep Phukan</a></address>
      <p>A united Opposition in the Lok Sabha on Monday attacked the Modi government over the detention of National Conference (NC) leader and Lok Sabha member Farooq Abdullah, calling it ‘illegal’and demanded his immediate release so that he could attend the winter session.</p>
      <p>On the first day of the new session, Opposition leaders also raised the issue of MPs not being allowed to visit Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) after the removal of its special status under Article 370, while a delegation of European Union (EU) lawmakers were allowed.</p>
      <p>Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s description of the delegation as one that was “hired on rent” invited strong protests from the Treasury benches, with Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi urging the Speaker to remove the Hindi expression.</p>
      <h3>‘Operation over’</h3>
      <p>“The operation is over but the patient is dead,”said Mr. Chowdhury referring to the government’s August 5 decision to abrogate J&amp;K’s special status and convert it into a union territory. “Our leader Rahul Gandhi was not allowed to visit [Jammu and Kashmir], several MPs were sent back,” said Mr. Chowdhury, while pointing out the EU delegation’s visit and added,“Isn’t it an insult to all MPs. I want to ask MPs of the ruling alliance, don’t they think it was their insult.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Chowdhury said it was the “right” of Dr. Abdullah, in detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA) for 106 days, to attend Parliament and called his detention an ‘atrocity.’</p>
      <p>The Congress leader also raised the issue of withdrawal of Special Protection Group cover of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Gandhi family.</p>
      <p>DMK leader T.R. Baalu sought Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s intervention and asked him to direct the government to release Dr. Abdullah. “What has happened with Farooq is illegal...You are custodian of the House...You have to make intervention,” Mr. Baalu said.</p>
      <p>The DMK leader also raised the issue of PDP leader and former J&amp;K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and pointed out that her daughter had alleged the PDP leader was manhandled.</p>
      <p>“Farooq Sahab represents Srinagar and it is the right of the 20 lakh people of Srinagar that their voice be heard in the House... I have proof that he is not in judicial custody, he is in preventive custody. Your one order can revoke it,” National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi said, while addressing the Chair.</p>
      <p>Trinamool’s Saugato Roy, who had given an adjournment motion, on Mr. Abdullah, also expressed concern about the former Chief Minister’s health.</p>
      <p>On his part, the Speaker informed the Lok Sabha that though Abdullah was not under detention when Home Minister Amit Shah had spoken in the House but subsequently taken into custody.</p>
      <p>He also assured the members that the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) would discuss when the House can debate Kashmir. Though the BAC discussed the matter, no date was fixed or time alloted as the government wanted the scheduling after consulting the Home Minister.</p>
      <p>The Lok Sabha witnessed slogan shouting and uproarious scenes as soon as the Question Hour started, with around 30 members from the Congress trooping into the Well and shouting slogans against slogans against the government for registering false cases against Opposition leaders.</p>
