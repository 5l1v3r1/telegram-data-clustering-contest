      <h1>Everton turned down Andy Robertson transfer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:49:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Former Everton director of football Steve Walsh has explained how the Toffees rejected both Andy Robertson and Harry Maguire despite him advising them to buy both…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Speaking to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">the Athletic</a>, he said: “While I was at Everton, I offered them Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire deals, when they were at Hull, and it was worth £20 million for the pair. Everton wouldn’t take them.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool bought Robbo for just £8m in 2017 and the Scot is now widely regarded as the best left-back on the planet – bizarrely missing out to Marcelo (now a Real Madrid sub) in the FIFPRO World XI.</p>
      <p>Maguire is not yet at that level but still became the most expensive defender in football history this summer when Manchester United took him off Leicester’s hands!</p>
      <p>Everton’s transfer mistakes over the past three or four years are plentiful. Examples of players they spent big money on who went on to very little include, but are not limited to: Davy Klassen, Cenk Tosun, Michael Keane, Jean-Philippe Gbamin, Nikola Vlasic and Sandro.</p>
      <p>The likes of Moise Keane and Alex Iwobi could well join the list.</p>
      <p>Liverpool on the other hand, under the guidance of Michael Edwards, have barely made a mistake in the Jurgen Klopp era.</p>
      <p>Players like the aforementioned Robbo, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Fabinho, Alisson, Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip have all arrived at Anfield and massively enhanced their reputation – becoming European champions in the process.</p>
