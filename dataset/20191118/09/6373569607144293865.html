      <p>A survey carried out by the Police Federation of England and Wales has revealed a shocking and stark outlook for officers, with many saying they regularly worry about the state of the personal finances, endure low morale and would warn off potential new recruits from joining the police.</p>
      <p>The findings are considered to be a clear warning to a Government who are aiming to recruit 20,000 new officers - after budget cuts to the country's police forces due to austerity saw nearly 22,000 officers lost over the last ten years.</p>
      <p>The Federations' Pay and Morale Survey found that in Devon &amp; Cornwall, 45 percent said they worry about money either every day or almost every day.</p>
      <p>A quarter of officers in Devon and Cornwall [25 percent] claimed they didn't have enough money to cover all of their essentials every month or almost every month and a shocking 11 percent reported that they never or almost never had enough money to cover their monthly essentials.</p>

      <p>Nearly nine in every ten officers who responded to the survey in Devon and Cornwall [88 percent], revealed that they did not feel fairly paid considering the stresses and strains of their job. A staggering 69 percent said they felt they were worse off financially than they were five years ago.</p>
      <p>In addition, three-quarters [75 percent] said their pay and pension arrangements had a negative impact on their morale.</p>
      <p>A shocking 86 percent felt that morale within the force was currently low and more than half of Devon and Cornwall police officers who responded to the survey [58 percent] said they would not recommend joining to police to others.</p>
      <p>Despite this, only nine percent said they had an intention to quite the force within the next two years - but those that said they did intend to leave, the majority [74 percent] cited their morale as being the biggest factor. The officers who responded were allowed to tick more than one option - with the next main reason for leaving the job [68 percent] was the impact of the job on their health and welbeing.</p>
      <p>The way police were treated as a whole and the impact of the job on officers' family and person life both came in in third place at 65 percent.</p>

      <p>Over a fifth of the Federation's membership in England and Wales – 19,654 – took part nationally in the survey, which ran between June and August this year.</p>
      <p>The Federation - which represent rank and file officers - said the survey provides vital evidence which would inform its work on pay and conditions as it look forward to renegotiations with the Government.</p>
      <p>In 2018 the National Audit Office report found the Government did not know "if the police system is financially sustainable". They also found that “the formula for funding police forces does not take into account the full range of demands on police time”.</p>
      <p>It revealed the current total police budget for 2018/19 is now £12.3bn, of which £8.6bn is funded by central government.</p>
      <p>The NAO noted how "central government funding to [Police and Crime] commissioners has fallen by 30 percent in real terms since 2010-11"</p>
      <p>It also found that "Police forces’ experience of funding reductions varies and the forces that most rely on government funding have experienced the greatest cuts."</p>
      <p>Most damning, the NAO report found that "while no police force has failed financially, there are signs emerging that forces are finding it harder to deliver an effective service."</p>
      <p>At the time, the Police Federation's chairman John Apter responded to the NAO's report saying it echoed what the Federation had been saying "for some time and must serve as a wake-up call to the government.</p>
      <p>"For too long it has turned a blind eye to the crisis in policing that has occurred on its watch and is of its own making."</p>
      <p>Responding to the latest Pay and Morale Survey, Insp Andrew Berry, chair of Devon &amp; Cornwall Police Federation said: "This research must shock whoever forms the next government into action. Everyday police officers in Devon and Cornwall go to work to protect and serve the public to the best of their ability putting themselves in harm's way.</p>
      <p>"Over the last 12 month there have been 882 assaults on police officers and together with the daily stress and trauma at work it is scandalous that they are being put in the position where they are dealing with additional anxiety caused by money worries when they get home.”</p>

      <p>"Our members must be paid fairly for the difficult job they do and should not be put in the unforgivable position of having to worry how they will make ends meet.</p>
      <p>"The next government must take action to re-dress up the 18 percent real-term cut in officers' pay caused by below inflation pay rises since 2010."</p>
      <p>Devon &amp; Cornwall Police Federation said it understands the financial pressure officers were under and as part of its priority to support officers' welfare it had delivered presentations on managing personal finances to more than 600 members this year.</p>
      <p>However, the Federation felt it was more sensible to see salaries raised rather than force officers to make further cutbacks both at work and at home.</p>

      <p>Insp Berry said: "These figures give a real sense of the struggles and frustrations facing my members, but despite feeling undervalued and underpaid most are still proud to be police officers.</p>
      <p>"This is typical of those who do this extraordinary job, and something appreciated by the public. It now needs to be appreciated by those will control the Government purse strings.</p>
      <p>"My members have experienced years of austerity; they have seen police office numbers fall by over 500 in this force and they continue to face rocketing demand.</p>
      <p>"In real terms they are working harder for less pay. They deserve better and we will continue to do all we can to ensure they get it."</p>
      <p>Insp Berry said the survey findings would be used in the Federation's submission to the Police Remuneration Review Body (PRRB - an independent group which advises the government on police pay) to help inform the pay award in 2020.</p>
