      <p>It’s difficult for critical thinking beings to rationalise with those-called-celebrities in Ghana especially the ladies taking into consideration their weird social lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Majority of them know no shame in reference to their apparel as they have thrown morality to the dogs, the case of <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/see-the-reply-efia-odo-gave-a-fan-who-asked-her-if-shell-make-it-to-heavenscreenshots/">Efia Odo</a> perhaps, reason she’s mocked a lot by Ghanaians on social media.</p>

      <p>As a reminder, Efia Odo’s outfit at the just ended 4Syte Music Video Awards has become the talk of Ghana following the provocative nature of the apparel. Consequently, she has been chastised a lot.</p>

      <p>It’s at the back of this that Efia Odo has taken to the micro blogging platform to voice her grievances as to why she’s hated a lot by Ghanaians despite that fact that she’s living her life.</p>
