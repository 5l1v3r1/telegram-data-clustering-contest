      <p>Big parts of Burton and South Derbyshire have been underwater since heavy rain started battering the region.</p>
      <p>As standing water struggles drain, flooding has made <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/swadlincote">roads impassible</a> and left drivers looking for alternative routes.</p>
      <p>But with a new week ahead, it appears that we might be in for some better news, according to the Met Office.</p>
      <p>Today, November 18, the sun will be making an appearance, but it will still be cold, so keep those <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/weather">gloves and scarves handy</a>.</p>
      <p>Temperatures will hit highs of 7C and it will be dry throughout the day.</p>
      <p>Tonight it will be cold, with clear skies and frost making way for fog patches in the morning.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow will be cold and frosty to start with, but the fog will slowly clear to make way for the sun.</p>
      <p>The maximum temperature will be 8C.</p>
      <p>It will be a cold and cloudy day on Wednesday, as temperatures hit highs of 7C, but it will stay dry.</p>
      <p>Thursday will be dry most of the day, but it will also be breezy, with patchy rain developing later in the day.</p>
      <p>Heavier rain will be back on Friday, with scattered blustery showers.</p>
      <p>Saturday and Sunday will also be dry, with some light rain overnight, forecasters have predicted.</p>
