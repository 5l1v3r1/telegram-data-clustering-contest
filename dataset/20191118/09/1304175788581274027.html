The first delivery is scheduled for the second quarter of 2020.<br/> <br/>“<i>The E195-E2 is the perfect aircraft to expand our operations in Africa and this new order is a further confirmation of our ‘no-city-left-behind initiative which we shall continue to execute</i>”, said Air Peace Chairman/CEO, Mr. <b>Allen Onyema</b>. He added, “<i>We are receiving impressive data about the aircraft’s economics now that is in revenue service, and this was a driver to place this new firm order with Embraer. We look forward to receiving our first aircraft, which will enhance connectivity in Nigeria and the African region, while feeding long-haul flights from our Lagos hub</i>.”<br/> <br/>“<i>Air Peace will love the aircraft’s efficiency and the passenger will experience an unparalleled level of comfort, especially in first class – Air Peace is the launch customer for Embraer’s new premium staggered seating option”, </i>said <b>Raul Villaron</b>, Vice President Sales, Africa and Middle East, Embraer Commercial Aviation<i>.</i> “<i>We look forward to supporting Air Peace’s growing E2s fleet and to deepening our fruitful partnership</i>.”</p>
      <p>Air Peace subsidiary, Air Peace Hopper, started operating six ERJ145 jets last year on short thin routes. That experience with Embraer’s products and services, including the pool programme, and the undeniable economic benefits of right-sizing aircraft for the mission, was a key factor in selecting the E2.<br/> <br/>Air Peace’s E195-E2s will be configured in a comfortable dual class arrangement with 124 seats. Air Peace operates more than 20 local, regional, and international routes and has strategic plans to expand those routes.</p>
