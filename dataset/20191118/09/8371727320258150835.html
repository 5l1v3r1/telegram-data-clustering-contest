      <h1>Safaricom Introduces New Fibre Plans for Business Customers, and They Are Not Cheap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:45:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Kenn Abuya</a></address>
      <p>Safaricom fibre services and related products have been around for a while. The FTTH (to the home) is the most popular product and serves homes that are close to areas that are connected by its fibre network, which include many parts in Nairobi and Central Kenya, as well as select towns in the country.</p>
      <p>The other product is fibre for business customers. Unlike FTTH, business coverage is not as robust but matches a similar product offered by the likes of Telkom. Safaricom says it has connected 3000 buildings so far and plans to push that number to 4500 by Q1 2020.</p>
      <p>The carrier has introduced new packages for the product that will see customers access as low as a 3 Mbps plan. Here is the new full list:</p>
      <p>
        <b>3 Mbps for KES 4000</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5 Mbps for KES 5500</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>10 Mbps for KES 15000</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is worth that these are business plans and not Home packages. Safaricom calls them ‘uninterrupted, high-speed connectivity for small to medium-sized businesses,’ and are highly-priced compared to Home plans.</p>
      <p>“As part of our new brand promise, we committed to being Simple, Transparent and Honest across all our products and operations. As part of this pledge we are renewing our promise to our Enterprise customers by introducing packages that suit their business needs, optimizing our response time, and by ensuring we deliver simple solutions with easy and transparent processes,” said Michael Joseph, CEO, Safaricom.</p>
      <p>For context, KES 4000 gives you 10 Mbps at home, and the most expensive plan, a 40 Mbps package, costs a little over KES 11,000.</p>
      <p>There are a ton of business internet plans out there, but Safaricom is probably one of the most reliable. I have had my fair share issues with their Home Fibre product and have documented my concerns on this site for a while, yet I have never left because while it has limitations, the competition is not doing very good either.</p>
