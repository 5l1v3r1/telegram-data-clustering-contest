    <meta property="og:description" content="Tasnim – KUALA LUMPUR, Iran national football team is hoping Iraq and Bahrain teams will drop points on Tuesday. Iraq will entertain Bahrain in Amman in Group C of the 2022 World Cup qualifier, the-AFC.com reported. Iraq’s two-point lead at the top of Group C could widen to five if it defeats Bahrain, something Srecko Katanec’s men are more than capable of doing. Iraq is on a three-match winning run after opening its campaign with a draw against Bahrain and its confidence will be sky high following the 2-1 win over Asia’s top-ranked side Iran on Thursday. A win for Bahrain will see the team overtaking Iraq, setting the stage for an exciting 90 minutes at the neutral venue of Amman International Stadium. Having suffered back-to-back defeats, Iran, who is not in action on Tuesday, will be hoping both teams drop points while Hong Kong and Cambodia face off with both needing wins to revive their respective campaigns."/>
