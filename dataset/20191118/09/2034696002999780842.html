      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/noel-gallagher">Noel Gallagher</a> has said that an <a href="http://nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a> reunion is looking as unlikely as ever, as a result of<a href="http://nme.com/artists/liam-gallagher"> Liam</a>‘s frequent outbursts on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The Britpop icons have been embroiled in a furious war of words since Oasis split up in 2009, only hours before they were due to play a Parisian festival.</p>
      <p>But Noel now says that every tweet posted by Liam is a “nail in the coffin” for the hopes of fans who still believe that they could join forces once more.</p>
      <p>He added that he would have to put his entire life on hold for the tour and vowed that he would not get on stage with his “moron” brother.</p>
      <p>Noel told <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/">The Big Issue</a>: “It’s strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let’s do it.</p>

      <p>“He’d put his whole life on hold to get Oasis back together.But every tweet he sends out, it’s another nail in the coffin of that idea.”</p>
      <p>Addressing Liam , he added: “If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you’ve said you are fucking more of a moron than you look.”</p>
      <p>Despite Liam outstripping Noel for album sales and gig tickets, he warned his brother to “ride it until the wheels come off”.</p>
      <p>The latest insult in their feud comes after Noel conceded that he’d rather have Boris Johnson than Liam for a brother.</p>
      <p>“I would say Boris is more entertaining,” Noel said. “His use of the English language is more superior.”</p>
      <p>Last month, Liam offered up a potential peace offering after admitting that he <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/liam-gallagher-invites-noel-wedding-hell-go-opening-anything-2548257">will invite his estranged brother to his upcoming wedding.</a></p>
