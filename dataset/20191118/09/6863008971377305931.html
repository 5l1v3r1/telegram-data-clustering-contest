      <p>Russia-occupied Crimea sees another environmental damage as a lake in the village of Kyzylove near the city of Sevastopol has dried up.</p>
      <p>"A lake in Kyzylove is no more. Yet it was there before. And it wasn't a drought that purposefully destroyed the harbor," blogger RoksolanaToday&amp;Crimea25% (@KrimRT) wrote on Twitter, posting respective photos.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, Russia-occupied Crimea may face <a href="https://www.unian.info/society/10756167-russia-occupied-crimea-may-face-irreversible-environmental-damage-over-lack-of-fresh-water.html">irreversible environmental damage</a> over the lack of fresh water, since large rivers of the peninsula have dried up.</p>
