        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/johnny-depp/">Johnny Depp</a> may be single again after reportedly splitting from his girlfriend Polina Glen, as she found his level of fame ‘scary’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pirates of the Caribbean actor was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/24/johnny-depp-romancing-russian-dancer-claimed-going-married-9314900/">first romantically linked to the Russian dancer in April</a> and sources even claimed marriage was on the cards for the couple.</p>
      <p>However, it’s now claimed Polina has decided to move back to her native Russia and feels it’s just the wrong timing for her to date the Hollywood star.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7693935/Johnny-Depps-girlfriend-Polina-Glen-ends-relationship.html">insider told the Mail on Sunday</a>: ‘Polina hated the attention the relationship was bringing her and found it scary.</p>
      <p>‘She’s now keeping her head down in Russia and told Johnny plans to get married were madness.’</p>
      <p>According to the insider, Polina had no interest in Johnny’s stardom or connections and made an effort to ‘keep her head down while living him’ and instead chose to focus on her dance choreography job.</p>

      <p>It’s also claimed Polina struggled to cope with the scrutiny surrounding Johnny, 56, amid his ongoing legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard, whom he split from in 2016.</p>

      <p>The source added: ‘His level of celebrity and his ongoing battle with Amber grew too much for her.</p>
      <p>‘Johnny has been distracted by his feud with Amber and she didn’t think the time was right for them to commit to anything.’</p>
      <p>Polina is now said to have returned to Russia ‘for the foreseeable future’.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Metro.co.uk has contacted Johnny’s reps for comment.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Johnny and Polina, 24, have certainly kept their romance under wraps the past year as they have barely been pictured together in public.</p>
      <p>News of their romance first emerged in April when Polina was seen out with Johnny in Moscow while he was touring with his rock band The Hollywood Vampires.</p>
      <p>At the time, sources claimed Polina was unaware who he was but found him ‘very talented’ and was keen to keep their relationship ‘low-key’.</p>
