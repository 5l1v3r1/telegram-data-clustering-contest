      <h1>James May Has Bought Yet Another New Car</h1>
      <h2>It's a "perfectly agreeable mid-size" sedan.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:07:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-karr/" target="_blank">Anthony Karr</a></address>
      <p>So, you were disappointed when earlier this month James May <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/380140/james-may-new-car-video/">showed his new car</a> and it was not an Italian supercar but a blue <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tesla/model-s/">Tesla Model S P100D</a>? Prepare to be even more frustrated then, as May has just unveiled his second new car in a 12-minute video on <i>Drivetribe</i>.</p>
      <p>Once again, don’t let the Porsche cover fool you as this is not a sports car from Stuttgart. It’s not a sports car <i>at all</i>, and it’s definitely not coming from Germany. It’s not even powered by a traditional internal combustion engine – May’s new ride is a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/toyota/mirai/">Toyota Mirai FCEV</a> in a machine silver color.</p>

      <p>In the clip, the former <i>Top Gear</i> host explains the reasons behind his decision to buy the fuel-cell vehicle and also explains the differences between a regular battery electric vehicle and a fuel-cell EV. We bet you know these differences pretty well so <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/james-may/">May</a> only spends several seconds in detailing the powertrain characteristics of the two cars.</p>
      <p>Next, he talks about the actual efficiency of a fuel-cell vehicle and compares the everyday suitability of the Mirai and the Model S. Obviously, the Californian <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/sedan/">sedan</a> has a big advantage when it comes to recharging as there are just eight hydrogen filling stations in the entire United Kingdom.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what the future of the car is going to be. I’m fairly convinced that they’ll be powered by electric motors in one way or another but I don’t know what we are actually going to do about the management and storage the electricity,” May concludes.</p>
      <p>So, if you have to choose between the Model S and the Mirai, which one would it be? Maybe May’s upcoming comparison test between the two could help you decide.</p>
