      <p>With the season four premiere of <i>Rick and Morty </i>now exclusively available for South Africans to stream on Showmax, here are the top five things we’ve learnt from the Emmy award-winning show’s creators.</p>
      <h3>There are still 70 episodes of Rick and Morty to come</h3>
      <p>Though season four will feature 10 new episodes, creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon have already signed on for 70 episodes in the many-layered <i>Rick and Mort</i>y universe.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of stories we want to tell, a lot to do, so it’s great,” Roiland told Showmax.</p>
      <h3>The show might go on for 20 seasons</h3>
      <p>According to the creators, <i>Rick and Morty</i> could happily go on for another 20 or 30 seasons, provided that it “still feels right” to produce.</p>
      <p>In fact, the duo believes that the show’s characters are “very Simpsons-esque”, and could remain relevant for many more years to come.</p>
      <h3>Fans should catch up on season three before watching season four</h3>
      <p>Though one could get sucked into <i>Rick and Morty</i> from any point in the animated series, Roiland and Harmon suggest that true fans watch season three ahead of season four to benefit from the “serialised” content.</p>
      <h3>Taika Waititi, Thor: Ragnarok director, guest stars in season four</h3>
      <p>Among the many guest-starring voices in season four, <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> and <i><a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/09/jojo-rabbit-trailer/">JoJo Rabbit</a></i> director Taika Waititi lends his voice to a character called Glootie.</p>
      <p>“We have Sam Neill, Kathleen Turner, Matthew Broderick, Liam Cunningham from <i>Game of Thrones,” </i>the creators also noted.</p>
      <h3>A Kanye West feature is in the works</h3>
      <p>Though Kanye West won’t feature in any upcoming episodes, talks to work with the star are underway.</p>
      <p>“We need to sit down and chat about it but it’s a very sincere and legitimate offer,” Roiland and Harmon explained.</p>
