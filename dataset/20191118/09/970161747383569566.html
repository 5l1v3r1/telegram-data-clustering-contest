      <p>A prosecutor used his 13-year-old daughter to lure a suspected sex offender back to the spot where he allegedly molested her.</p>
      <p>The girl told her doctor she had been sexually assaulted three times between August and October while walking her dog on the Los Alamitos Trail in San Jose, California.</p>
      <p>A investigation was then launched by police, but the girl’s father decided to take matters into his own hands, and arranged for her to revisit the trail.</p>
      <p>He told his daughter to walk back and forth on the path, while the two of them stayed in touch using their phones and earbuds.</p>
      <p>San Jose Detective Sgt. Sean Pierce said in his report on the case: ‘He stated that they had already done this several times.</p>

      <p>‘He instructed [the victim] to let [the suspect] identify and make the contact and if she cannot handle things she should move away.</p>
      <p>‘He instructed [the victim] to walk back and forth on the designated route and don’t interact with anyone for very long.’</p>
      <p>The prosecutor filmed the man interacting with his daughter and gave the recording to the police.</p>
      <p>Ali Mohammad Lajmiri, 76, of San Jose, was arrested the next day and later charged with lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 and false imprisonment.</p>

      <p>The prosecutor is now under scrutiny for possibly endangering his child after he used her as ‘bait’.</p>
      <p>His actions have been met with dismay by members of the local law enforcement community, including some colleagues and police officers he has worked with, The Mercury News reports.</p>
      <p>San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia advised against citizens taking the law into their own hands.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘As a father, I understand how emotional it can be when your child is the victim of a crime.</p>
      <p>‘But we have to remember that the safety of the child comes first and channel that frustration in a positive way to assist the investigation and not hinder it.’</p>
      <p>Lajmiri is currently being held in the Santa Clara County jail on $3,000,000 (about £2,300,000) bail, and is scheduled to appear in court on January 29.</p>
