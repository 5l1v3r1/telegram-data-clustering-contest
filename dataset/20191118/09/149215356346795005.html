      <p>John Oliver spent the bulk of Sunday's season finale of <i>Last Week Tonight</i> on something that will take place before he starts filming his next season: The decennial U.S. census. "The concept of the census is very simple," he said. "At the start of each decade, the government does a comprehensive count of every single person residing in the United States — not just citizens, not just voters, every single person. Because only by knowing how many people live where can communities effectively plan to provide things like roads, schools, and emergency services."</p>
      <p>"However hard counting every single person seems, it's actually much harder," Oliver said. "Conducting the census is the largest and most complicated peacetime operation that the government undertakes, and the 2020 census is likely to be even more challenging than usual, for reasons ranging from budget shortfalls to active Republican meddling. So tonight, let's talk about it. And let's start with what questions are actually on the census, because a lot of people don't know what they are — and that very much includes the current president."</p>
      <p>Oliver ran though the simple list of questions, listed some reasons people refuse to provide the government that basic information — there's a quick trip down a libertarian YouTube rabbit hole — and laid out why participation in the census is so important. He recapped the flap about the citizenship question President Trump <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/852376/trump-claims-didnt-back-down-census-backed">wanted to add</a> to the 2020 census, explained how it was revealed to be <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/863455/master-modern-gerrymander-promised-bedevil-democrats-until-dying-day-notes-show">explicitly driven by a scheme to entrench Republicans</a> in power, and lamented that the damage might already be done.</p>
      <p>"All in all, there is a lot working against this census, and experts are worried an undercount next year is inevitable," possibly by millions of people, Oliver said. "So what can we do?" Fill out the census, mostly — and he gave some incentives, ending with how much your participation would "irritate" Trump. There's NSFW language. Watch below. Peter Weber</p>
