          <p>India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who started as a right-hand offbreak bowler, added plentiful skills up his sleeve during the course of his career. Ashwin eventually graduated to bowl leg-spin in domestic matches.</p>

                <p>Ashwin, who recently made the switch from <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/ravi-ashwin-trade-kxip-to-trade-ashwin-for-trent-boult-and-jagadeesh-suchith-with-delhi-capitals-before-ipl-2020-auction-say-reports/">Kings XI Punjab to Delhi Capitals</a> in the Indian Premier League, continued to try novel things in Indore as he was also seen bowling left-handed in Indore. It is worth mentioning that the Indian team had trained with the pink ball in Indore yesterday.</p>
