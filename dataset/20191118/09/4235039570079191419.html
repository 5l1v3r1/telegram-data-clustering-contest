      <p>CEO of <b>SpaceX</b> space technology company <b>Elon Musk</b> has said it will take 20 years and 1,000 spacecraft to build a <b>city</b> on <b>Mars</b>, which is his long-term vision.</p>
      <p>Musk wrote on Twitter that <b>SpaceX</b> will need to build about 1,000 spaceships for <b>Mars</b>, which will need to transport cargo, infrastructure and crew to <b>Mars</b> over the course of 20 years since planetary alignment only really allows for a realistically achievable <b>Mars</b> flight once every two years, Tech Crunch reported.</p>
      <p>The launch costs about $ 2 million per spacecraft, and Musk says the ultimate goal is to build a "self-sustaining <b>city</b> of Mars."</p>
