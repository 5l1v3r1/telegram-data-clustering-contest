      <h4>Partnership enables VLeisure to provide live room rates and inventory from global hotel groups.</h4>
      <p><b>Booking platform VLeisure</b> announced that it has partnered with <b>Travel Prologue</b>, a leading <b>B2B hotel</b> direct booking service provider, to deliver live room rates and inventory to traditionally offline B2B channels like travel agencies, wholesalers and corporate travel intermediaries.</p>
      <p>With this partnership, VLeisure is able to provide an open ecology network to its customers, while leveraging on Travel Prologue’s hotel connectivity services and network of hotels such as Mandarin Orchard Singapore, Furama Hotels International and Berjaya Hotels &amp; Resorts. VLesiure’s technology will deliver seamless payment solutions and many more efficiency driven modules for wholesalers and agents.</p>
      <p><b>Phan Le</b>, CEO of VLeisure, said: “<i>An Open Eco system for the travel industry will be the next development in the hotel distribution business. There is no longer a “one man wins” in hotel distribution anymore, making it more of a level playing field. Sharing technology is the way to go and Travel Prologue shares the same ideology with our vision on this. We are delighted to be able to partner with them</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>Ho Siang Twang</b>, Managing Director of Travel Prologue, said “<i>Our B2B hotel direct booking service, Trip Affiliates Network (“TA Network”), is designed to help hotels and their B2B channels improve their direct bookings with one another. We are excited to work with like-minded partners like VLeisure on the open ecosystem initiative where we can provide our partners with online access to live room rates and inventory</i>.”</p>
