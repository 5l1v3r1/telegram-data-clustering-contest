      <h1>Tangerang police seize over a thousand refurbished iPhones sent from Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:35:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Police in Tangerang say they have uncovered an illegal cell phone refurbishment factory in the city belonging to a syndicate who have been selling previously damaged iPhones at a fraction of their retail price.</p>
      <p>Police raided the factory, located in a shophouse, which had been operating for about a month. Two employees, identified by their initials R and WS, were arrested.</p>
      <p>“Based on a tip from locals who were suspicious of their activity, we carried out an investigation and uncovered this illegal cell phone factory,” Tangerang Police Chief Ade Ary Syam <a href="https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/4113053/polisi-bongkar-pabrik-rekondisi-iphone-di-tangerang?utm_source=Digital+Marketing&amp;utm_medium=Partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Line">told </a><a href="https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/4113053/polisi-bongkar-pabrik-rekondisi-iphone-di-tangerang?utm_source=Digital+Marketing&amp;utm_medium=Partnership&amp;utm_campaign=Line"><i>Liputan 6</i>.</a></p>
      <p>According to the police, the iPhones were sent to Tangerang from Singapore via Batam in states of disrepair. The phones were then refurbished and sold online through e-commerce platforms.</p>
      <p>The factory was able to refurbish 50 to 100 units per day, comprising of older models like the iPhone 6s to the latest iPhone 11 models. </p>
      <p>Each phone was sold for around IDR4-8 million (US$284-568). For comparison, the official retail price of an iPhone 6s starts from IDR4.5 million, while the most expensive model available in Indonesia, the iPhone Xs, starts from IDR19.6 million.</p>
      <p>“Their revenue was quite large, IDR150 million in a month. According to [the suspects], refurbished cellphones are quite in demand by people who want a luxurious lifestyle with smaller investments,” Ade said.</p>
      <p>Police seized 1,697 iPhones during the raid. R and WS have been charged with consumer fraud and violation of trade laws. Both are looking at a minimum of five years in prison if convicted.</p>
