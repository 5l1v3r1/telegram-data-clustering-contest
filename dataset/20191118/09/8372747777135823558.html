      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- You may want to fill up your car soon. Gas prices in Florida right now are at a 9-month low.</p>
      <p>Florida drivers are now paying 13 cents less than we were a month ago.</p>
      <p>As of Monday morning, the average price of regular unleaded fuel was $2.36. Thatâ€™s 23 cents below the national average, and a $2 savings on a full tank of gas.</p>
      <p>In Southwest Florida, Charlotte County has the cheapest gas, followed by Lee, then Collier counties.</p>
      <p>AAA says drivers can thank strong gains in fuel supplies as well as flat prices for crude oil.</p>
      <p>"Thanksgiving Day gas prices are poised to be the lowest for the holiday in three years, so long as the state average remains below $2.45 per gallon," says AAA spokesman Mark Jenkins.</p>
