      <p>There are now 2.9 million children growing up in poverty in working households across the country, according to a new study.</p>
      <p>The number of kids being raised in destitution has increased by 800,000 since 2010, the report from union TUC suggests.</p>
      <p>That means one in four youngsters could be struggling to get by each day, which is a staggering 38% rise in the last decade.</p>
      <p>The TUC claims government policies, weak wage growth and more insecure work accounted for 485,000 children who had been pushed into in-work poverty.</p>

      <p>TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘No child in Britain should be growing up in poverty, but millions of parents are struggling to feed and clothe their kids.</p>
      <p>‘The Conservatives’ cuts to in-work benefits have come at a terrible human cost. As too has their failure to tackle insecure work and get wages rising across the economy.</p>

      <p>‘We need a government that puts working families first, not wealthy donors and hedge funds.’</p>
      <p>Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood added: ‘The Conservatives and Lib Dems should hang their heads in shame for nine years of austerity which has left working families struggling to feed their children, as shown by these new shocking figures.</p>
      <p>‘How we care for and protect our children is a mark of a civilised society.</p>
      <p>‘The TUC’s figures show just how badly Conservative and Lib Dem coalition governments have failed them.’</p>
