      <h1>Google Panics, Adds 10 More Games To Stadia's Launch Lineup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:30:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>Perhaps spooked by the fact the only people who seem to care about the impending launch of their Stadia home streaming platform <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-confirms-all-the-stuff-stadia-wont-have-at-launc-1839839278">are those n</a>oting everything wrong with it, Google has at the 11th hour — this thing is releasing tomorrow, on November 19! — almost doubled the number of games that’ll be available when it goes live.</p>
      <p>Originally intending to launch with 12 games, Google will now be releasing 22, with the extra ten — including titles such as <i>NBA 2K20</i>, <i>Final Fantasy XV</i> and <i>Rage 2 </i>— having been bumped up from the list of titles that were originally expected to come to Stadia “later in 2019".</p>
