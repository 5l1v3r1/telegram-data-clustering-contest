      <h1>Ford unveils all-electric Mustang Mach E SUV and it looks good</h1>

      <p>Ford has dramatically stepped up its presence in the electric car market with a new all-electric SUV called the Mach E.</p>
      <p>It comes under the Mustang label and is a clear statement against Tesla and the hugely popular Model X vehicle.</p>
      <p>The rear-wheel drive (RWD) car boasts 280 miles of range on a single charge of the 75kWh battery. And it’s no slouch either, managing 0-62mph in less than eight seconds.</p>
      <p>According to Dave Pericak, the man responsible for all of Ford’s ‘icon’ cars, the Mach E still ‘absolutely drives like a Mustang.’</p>
      <p>The base version will start at £40,000 with deliveries slated to begin towards the end of next year. Anyone that’s feeling flush can put down £58,000 and reserve the ‘first edition’ which comes with all-wheel drive (AWD), a bigger 99kWh battery and a 370 mile range.</p>

      <p>Ford chairman Bill Ford Jr said the Mach E puts together two previously conflicting goals: His desire for Ford to be a leader in clean cars and make the automaker carbon-neutral by 2030, and his personal love of the Mustang and its growling V-8 engine.</p>

      <p>‘We are really pushing our chips in on the table with this vehicle,’ Ford said in an interview ahead of the Mach E’s unveiling. The automaker has said it will spend $11.5 billion developing electric and hybrid models by 2022.</p>

      <p>Car manufacturers have struggled to make money on electric vehicles but Ford Jr told Reuters after unveiling the Mach E that it will be ‘profitable right from the start.’</p>
      <p>Ford’s confidence in the Mach E, and its determination to challenge Tesla, was reflected in the location the company chose to reveal it: An airplane hangar just a short walk from the main offices of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s SpaceX operations in Hawthorne, Calif.</p>
      <p>Musk often uses SpaceX facilities to unveil Tesla’s new models, and has scheduled the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/elon-musk-will-reveal-teslas-cybertruck-november-21-11055540/">debut of his own electric pickup for later this week</a>.</p>
