      <p>JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian anti-terrorism officers shot dead two suspected bomb makers during a raid on the weekend and arrested more than a dozen as authorities linked a suicide bombing last week to an Islamic State-inspired network, police said on Monday.</p>

      <p>A 24-year-old student blew himself up outside a police station in the city of Medan in North Sumatra province last Wednesday, killing himself and wounding six people.</p>
      <p>Police had initially declared the attacker to be a “lone wolf”, but a national police spokesman said on Monday the student along with 22 other suspects in the area had links to the Islamic State-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD).</p>
      <p>JAD has been blamed for a series of attacks in recent years and was banned in Indonesia last year for “conducting terrorism” and being affiliated with foreign militants.</p>
      <p>“(The network in) North Sumatra has direct links to JAD,” police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo said in a statement, adding that a leader of the group had been arrested.</p>
      <p>“Their main target is the police,” Prasetyo said in comments broadcast on television.</p>
      <p>Of the 23 suspects, two suspected bomb-makers were shot dead on Saturday while resisting arrest, while one officer was wounded during the raid, said Prasetyo.</p>
      <p>Bomb-making material was seized, he said.</p>
      <p>Four suspects had turned themselves in and the others had been arrested, he said.</p>
      <p>Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, has seen a resurgence in militancy in recent years, with police frequently the target of attacks.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of suspects have been detained under tougher new anti-terrorism laws brought in at the beginning of the year after a series of suicide bombings linked to the JAD group killed more than 30 people in the city of Surabaya.</p>
      <p>Last month, a man affiliated to JAD was named a suspect in the stabbing and wounding of the then security minister.</p>
      <p>Stanislaus Riyanta, a terrorism analyst, warned that militants could intensify attacks in retaliation for the death of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who killed himself last month during a U.S. commando raid on his compound in Syria.</p>
      <p>“Alert levels for terror acts must be ratcheted up because of the momentum that’s usually associated with the Christmas and New Year period for radical groups to act,” he said.</p>
