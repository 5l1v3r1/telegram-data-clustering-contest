      <p>The Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) is set to release the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) results today.</p>
      <p>A source intimated to <i>Kahawa Tungu </i>that Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha is set to brief President Uhuru Kenyatta on this year’s KCPE report before releasing the results on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>KNEC officials have also gathered at KNEC headquarters ahead of the release.</p>
      <p>This comes 18 days after the examinations came to an end.</p>
      <p>The Education ministry has been releasing the results earlier than in previous years for the past three years.</p>
      <p>Marking of the exams ended last week and was largely aided by the Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) machines except for English Composition and Kiswahili Insha papers.</p>
      <p>1,088,986 candidates sat for the exams this year.</p>
