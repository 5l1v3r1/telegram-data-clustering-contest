      <p>MONROE — EvergreenHealth Monroe has a new chief administrative officer after former executive Renee Jensen <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/chief-executive-leaves-evergreenhealth-monroe-after-2-years/">left abruptly in July</a>.</p>
      <p>Lisa LaPlante, who has served as interim leader after Jensen’s departure, will be the new chief administrative officer.</p>
      <p>Jensen resigned from her position after just two years at the organization. EvergreenHealth never provided details as to the nature of her departure.</p>
      <p>LaPlante joined EvergreenHealth Monroe in 2010 to lead the quality division, according to the hospital’s website.</p>
      <p>She holds a bachelor of science degree in health care services and a master’s in healthcare administration from the University of Phoenix. LaPlante has been working in health care since 1993, starting at a hospital-based home health agency in Moab, Utah.</p>
      <p>In 2002, she took a position overseeing accreditation at Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez, Colorado. She also served as the chief quality and compliance officer there before moving to EvergreenHealth Monroe.</p>
      <p>For many years, EvergreenHealth Monroe was called Valley General Hospital.</p>
      <p>Leaders in the public hospital district later decided to affiliate with the EvergreenHealth system, a public hospital district just to the south in northeast King County. As part of its new affiliation, the name changed to EvergreenHealth Monroe in March 2015.</p>
