      <p>Hong Kong police laid siege to the Polytechnic University last night and on Monday morning, firing rubber bullets and tear gas to pin down anti-government protesters armed with petrol bombs to stop them from fleeing.</p>
      <p>The scenes were the latest iteration of protests that have led to an increasingly violent atmosphere in Hong Kong. Protesters – mainly students – have turned their ire on the city’s police force, which they accuse of brutality.</p>
      <p>Last week, the police shot a protester, who was left in critical condition, a person was set on fire, and a 70-year-old died after being hit with a brick.</p>
      <p>The stand-off at the university followed a day of violent clashes that saw protesters throw bricks and petrol bombs at police and set alight a police car.</p>
      <p>Many protesters retreated to the Polytechnic University, where barricades were erected and fires raged both inside and outside the building.</p>
      <p>Following this violence on Sunday night and Monday morning – some of the worst the city has yet seen – a senior US official called on Beijing to protect Hong Kong’s freedom.</p>
      <p>“We condemn the unjustified use of force and urge all sides to refrain from violence and engage in constructive dialogue,” the senior official in President Donald Trump’s White House said.</p>
      <p>“As the President has said, the United States expects Beijing to honor its commitments under the Sino-British joint declaration and to protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system and democratic way of life,” the official said.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s economy has been hard-hit by the protests which have rocked the city since April. The city fell into its first recession in a decade in the third quarter, with the economy shrinking by 3.2 per cent.</p>

      <p>Tourists have been deterred from travelling to the city while many students from mainland China have returned home.</p>
