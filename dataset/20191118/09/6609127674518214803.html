      <p>Jacqueline Jossa, Kate Garraway, Andrew Maxwell, Myles Stephenson and Roman Kemp were among some of the other celebs forced to balance on the teetering platform.</p>
      <p>The former Gunners forward, who is the bookies favourite to win, has previously admitted to being a well known sleep walker with his friends and family.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sun, Ian said: “If I do sleepwalk I hope they direct me back to the bed, that’s what my mum used to do as a kid.</p>
      <p>“Dennis [Bergkamp] used to turn me back round towards my bed, all I need is someone to turn me back around.”</p>

      <p>“So those things can get to people. You shouldn’t be afraid to show those feelings, I’m not afraid at all. It’s nice to have a little cry.”</p>
      <p>He also says viewers should expect to see his emotional side as he admits he’s prone to crying.</p>
      <p>Ian added: “I’m a very emotional guy and in the right circumstances your emotions come out.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to be crying for no reason, and people think, ‘What’s up with him?’</p>
      <p>“You’re going to be under a lot of emotional pressure, with respect of food and tiredness and stress."</p>
