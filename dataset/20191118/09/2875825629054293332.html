      <h1>Denise Welch celebrates Katie Hopkins' downfall as disgraced star loses £1m home</h1>
      <h2>Denise didn't hold back when she offered no sympathy up to the humiliated Katie Hopkins following her downfall</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:10:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:10</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Denise Welch triumphed in Katie Hopkins' fall from the top.</p>
      <p>Outspoken Katie was forced to sell off <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-katie-hopkins-five-bedroom-11879232">her £1million Devon home</a> and now rents following a humiliating court case.</p>
      <p>The far-right activist was obliged to sell up after she slapped with a £500,000 legal bill when writer Jack Monroe sued her for libel and won.</p>
      <p>Her controversial views, which have seen her sacked from two lucrative newspaper columns and LBC radio show, have made her unpopular.</p>
      <p>In the light of the news, Denise couldn't resist digging the knife in further with a scathing tweet.</p>
      <p>Thick with sarcasm, the telly star was unable to offer up any sympathy to Katie.</p>
      <p>Sharing The Mirror's article, she wrote: "Poor old Katie Hopkins. Couldn't have happened to a nicer person."</p>

      <p>It comes after Katie confessed speaking her mind had lost her career in an interview with <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/subscribe/digital/?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=UK_BP_o_Sunday+Times_Brand_o_Exact&amp;utm_term=sunday+times&amp;adgroup=Sunday+Times&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ds_rl=1255462&amp;ds_rl=1255480&amp;ds_rl=1255480&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrbCDv7Pz5QIVSLDtCh2SjA3dEAAYASAAEgI_bvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">The Sunday Times</a> .</p>
      <p>"I live in a rented, modern, four-bedroom detached house with my husband Mark and our three children, aged 15, 14 and 10," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's tucked out of the way for security reasons - our last home was rigged up to the local police station and had panic alarms fitted because of threats I received to my life.</p>

      <p>"I was forced to sell it for £950,000 in early 2018 to pay off a legal bill in excess of £500,000."</p>
      <p>Katie didn't apologise for the circumstances leading up to the 2017 legal case.</p>

      <p>Hopkins did express regret she hadn't acted sooner to settle the case out of court.</p>
      <p>Asked what her worst business decision had been, she said: "Arguably, not settling the legal case brought against me.</p>
      <p>"I could have settled by giving £5,000 to a migrant charity but chose not to, and the ensuing court action and legal bills <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-secretly-forced-file-13254535">forced me to apply for an individual voluntary arrangement</a> ."</p>
