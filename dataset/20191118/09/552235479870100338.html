      <h2>The charity provides free toiletries to people experiencing hardship.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:58:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">Debbie Hall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/debbie-hall/</a></address>
      <p>Dignity Boxes, a charity which provides free toiletries to people experiencing hardship, celebrated the official launch of its first premises in Livingston.</p>
      <p>Shelley Kerr, manager of the Scotland women’s football team officially opened the new site in Kirkton Campus for the charity which was founded by Isabel Dosser, a former nurse for 30 years and university lecturer.</p>
      <p>She decided to launch the charity after attending a conference workshop on poverty when she heard first-hand the difficulties people face without food and basic toiletries and felt compelled to help.</p>
      <p>The charity, set up in 2018, appeals to the public and companies to donate toiletries, including soap, deodorant and shampoo, which volunteers deliver to organisations who work with people experiencing deprivation with the aim of helping to promote self-worth and dignity.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Over the last year the number of volunteers has grown from one to 25 who collect donations from over 50 locations, including Sky in Livingston and various Morrisons stores in Edinburgh and then distribute over 700 products every month to 27 organisations with Dignity Boxes in West Lothian and Edinburgh, and soon East Lothian.</p>
      <p>These include Social Bite, where a box is available on Tuesdays at The Dale Hub, a family support organisation in Armadale.</p>
      <p>Business Gateway West Lothian has provided ongoing support to the charity since it began in areas including 121 mentoring, planning and funding advice.</p>
      <p>Isabel said: “After attending the conference on poverty last year, I left thinking about ways I could help people in times of difficulty to gain access to basic toiletries.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I had no idea at the beginning which direction my plans would go and definitely didn’t think it would take off in the way it has thanks to so many volunteers, companies and members of the public who have donated products and Business Gateway West Lothian who have continued to offer me ongoing support.</p>
      <p>“From the first appointment with an advisor, when I didn’t really know what I was doing, I was encouraged and supported to keep going and believe in my idea.</p>
      <p>“When you are given an adviser who has so much experience and patience and nothing you say seems silly – this really does gives you confidence to continue knowing you have someone there who you can pick up the phone to or meet face-to-face who will help you along the way, which is invaluable.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Cathy Muldoon, executive councillor for development and transport said: “It’s great to see Business Gateway West Lothian supporting a local charity to grow and prosper.</p>
      <p>“The support they offer can be invaluable for any business or charity who are looking for advice on how they can develop in West Lothian.”</p>
      <p>Executive councillor for voluntary organisations, Kirsteen Sullivan, added: “Dignity Boxes provide an invaluable service to help those in need of extra help, and their new premises should allow them to expand the support they offer.”</p>
