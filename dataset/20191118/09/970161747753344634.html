        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/my-chemical-romance/">My Chemical Romance</a> has revealed the first glimpse of the band back in the rehearsal space after<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/chemical-romance-announces-first-gig-since-2012-relive-emo-days-11021774/"> announcing an anticipated reunion show</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The group – made up of Gerard and Mikey Way, Frank Iero and Ray Toro – surprised fans when they revealed they’d got the band back together for their first gig since 2012.</p>
      <p>And no, we’re still not over it.</p>
      <p>Now the group has whet our whistles and given us even more reason to not be ok as they shared a shot of themselves just chilling in the studio.</p>
      <p>Taking five as they prepared for their concert, the band members could be seen chilling on the floor as they sat in a circle.</p>
      <p>Are they mulling over adding more dates to their big comeback? Some tunes perhaps? Lyrics? Are they talking about lyrics?</p>

      <p>The group was pretty hush hush about what was going down in this particular shot, as the photo was simply captioned: ’11.15.19.’</p>

      <p>Still, a picture tells a thousand words and we’re lapping up every last detail of the black and white shot.</p>
      <p>Before the group announced their reunion last month, Joe Jonas teased at their return earlier this year, and claimed that while the Jonas Brothers were rehearsing in New York, MCR were apparently there rehearsing right next to them.</p>

      <p>What a time to be alive.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got some dirt,’ the 30-year-old said on KISS FM Breakfast Show: ‘My Chemical Romance were apparently rehearsing next to us in New York recently, which — I thought they broke up, so…that’s the gossip!’</p>
      <p>And he’s not the only one to have mentioned their reunion as earlier this year, the Warped Tour organiser Kevin Lyman hoped to get the group to reform for the event’s 25th-anniversary shows.</p>
      <p>‘I tried,’ he explained in response to a fan’s Twitter question of the band’s absence.</p>
      <p>But it seems as though their fans’ prayers have finally been answered, as the boys will be taking to the stage in Los Angeles, on 20 December, and it’s going to be emotional.</p>
      <p>It was all set in stone on Halloween when, on the band’s official Twitter, which hasn’t posted anything since May, tweeted: ‘Like Phantoms Forever… Tickets on Sale Friday 11/1/19 at 12:00 PM Pacific.’</p>
