      <p>The skyrocketing price of onion has made the common man look at this vegetable as a luxury item. Arrival of early season crops has fallen in states liked Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, while floods in Maharashtra and Gujarat have severely damaged crop yield. Added to this, hoarding and profiteering by traders and middlemen are complicating the picture. In Assam, the minister for Food and Civil Supplies has stated that the price of onion must not go beyond Rs 66 per kg, but the announcement seems to have fallen on deaf ears. If the authorities are to retain credibility among the public, they should back up their own statements with stern action against unscrupulous traders and middlemen fleecing the people.</p>
