      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! may have already planted the seeds for a new romance as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> plans to butter up <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> – who had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-awkwardness-caitlyn-jenner-admits-doesnt-know-uk-celebs-11172779/">no idea who her camp mates were last night</a> – because of her supermodel daughter, Kendall Jenner.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> winner was among the 10 camp mates to finally arrive in the jungle last night, after facing what was without a doubt one of the most terrifying trials in recent memory as they all came dangerously close to being blown of a sky scraper.</p>

      <p>It was a lot to take on a Sunday night.</p>

      <p>Today Myles’ Rak-Su band mates – Ashley Fongho, Jamaal Shurland and Mustafa Rahimtulla – appeared on Lorraine where they explained the singer has a lot at stake during his I’m A Celebrity stint – a potential romance with Kendall. Kind of.</p>
      <p>‘Last year we were in LA and we were in the same bar as Kendall Jenner but he didn’t talk to her,’ Ashley spilled.</p>
      <p>‘Was he too shy?’ quipped Lorraine.</p>
      <p>‘He was, yeah, so this is like a second chance,’ Ashley continued.</p>
      <p>Good luck with that, Myles…</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old – who only recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/happened-im-celebritys-myles-stephenson-love-islands-gabby-allen-11171785/">split with Love Island star Gabby Allen</a> – recently hinted he could leave Rak-Su should his career take off after his time in the jungle.</p>
      <p>‘They [Rak-Su bandmates] are really supportive and they totally understand,’ he insisted. ‘I would love to stay in the band but if other opportunities come along my way as well after this, you have to take it by the scruff of the neck.’</p>
