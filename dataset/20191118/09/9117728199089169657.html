        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> won his third Grand Prix of the season after overtaking <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> twice and surviving two safety car restarts at the end of the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>. The Dutchman drove well and the Dutch press has reacted positively to their 22-year-old superstar. Some even link the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> driver to Ayrton Senna. </b>
      </p>
      <p>De Telegraaf starts by drawing a comparison with Ayrton Senna. You can hardly give a driver a bigger compliment, certainly not in Brazil. <i>“Never before has the Dutchman appeared so dominant in the royal class. After an error-free Saturday, the 22-year-old Limburger rode an unparalleled day from pole position to his first victory on Brazilian territory, putting him back in the footsteps of Ayrton Senna."</i></p>

      <p>At the Algemeen Dagblad, Verstappen even features on the front page and calls his performance <i>"Perfect!" "Max Verstappen drove flawlessly, had a team dyke behind him and eventually won the monument on the racing calendar with conviction."</i> This newspaper also made a comparison with Senna this weekend but did so after qualifying.</p>
      <p>Even the Times puts Senna's name in there and links it to Verstappen:<i> "''Verstappen Verstappen,' echoed during the podium ceremony with Brazilian accent on the Interlagos circuit. Just like on the track the name of Ayrton Senna was once chanted, the Brazilian racing icon with which Verstappen has been compared so often in recent years. On Sunday, he reminded the racing world why."</i></p>

      <p>Trouw does not make a comparison with the Brazilian racing legend but does call Verstappen's victory 'masterclass' and still refers to last year's race.<i> “Satisfaction was the big word afterwards. Last year Verstappen also took the lead in Brazil for most of the race, but because Esteban Ocon stayed behind, the Limburger had to leave the win to Hamilton. This time it went differently."</i></p>
