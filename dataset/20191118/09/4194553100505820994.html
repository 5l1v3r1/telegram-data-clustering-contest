      <h1>Coutinho’s Bayern dream becoming a nightmare; Phil scapegoated following 5-1 mauling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:13:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>It looked to all the world like Coutinho’s loan switch to Bayern Munich at the end of the European summer transfer window had released our former no.10 from Ernesto Valverde’s shackles.</p>
      <p>After being cast out from first-team action at Barca, Coutinho was immediately granted a spot in Niko Kovac’s team.</p>
      <p>In his first four starts, he registered three assists and two goals – demonstrating the kind of numbers he was racking up for Liverpool towards the end of his Anfield stint under Jurgen Klopp – before he got his dream Nou Camp switch.</p>
      <p>But it looks as though it’s gone sour over at the Allianz…</p>
      <p>Coutinho hasn’t got a goal/assist in six consecutive Bayern matches and has subsequently lost his place as a starter to boot.</p>
      <p>The playmaker was hauled off before the hour mark of Bayern’s 5-1 defeat to Frankfurt at the start of November, and seems to have been made the scapegoat, along with Kovac, who lost his job…</p>
      <p>In the two fixtures that followed, Coutinho played a combined 20 minutes under Hans-Dieter Flick, the interim boss who according to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/16/hansi-flick-to-stay-bayern-munich-head-coach-at-least-until-christmas">Guardian</a> will be there until Christmas at least.</p>
      <p>The German is using Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman on the wings – and utilising more tactically adept, physical midfielders like Leon Goretzka centrally with Thomas Muller at no.10.</p>
      <p>Matches against Olympiakos and Borussia Dortmund were won 2-0 and 4-0 respectively, so it doesn’t look like his tactic will change soon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/coutinho-volvera-barca-solo-tiene-oferta-interesante">Don Balon</a> have claimed Bayern have already told Barca they won’t buy Coutinho, although they are hardly the most trusted publication.</p>
      <p>We wonder just how much Coutinho regrets his decision to leave Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool before we became European champions and Premier League favourites.</p>
