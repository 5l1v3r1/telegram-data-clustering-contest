      <h1>Processing and Shaping of the Wire as We Know It</h1>
      <h2>Wires come in every shape and size, but if you were wondering exactly how they are shaped differently, this video will bring the clarification you need.</h2>

      <p>When you think about it, wires are pretty important in different areas, and even if we underestimate the benefits of wires, without them, many sectors would start crumbling down. So, it can be understood that wires are used in many different fields, and they all come in different shapes and sizes. But how? Who does that? Hulk? Of course not Hulk. It's not even real.</p>
      <p>There are, of course, machines that do it for us humans. And as we can guess, if machines didn't handle the task, it'd be extremely hard for humans to bend, twist or roll the wires and do it in such a short span of time. It'd take a lot of money, effort, and people too. The technology we have today makes it possible, though.</p>
      <p>In the video, you can see how machines process all the wires that you come across around every day and you can't help but admire the smart machines that were created by humans and which, in the end, do all the work for them.</p>
