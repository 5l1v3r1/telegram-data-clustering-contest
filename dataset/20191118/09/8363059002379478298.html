      <h1>Brand New Cherry Flavor, a Supernatural Revenge Story, Is Headed to Netflix With Rosa Salazar in the Lead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:30:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Muncy</a></address>
      <p>Okay, this sounds fantastic: <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/brand-new-cherry-flavor-series-netflix-rosa-salazar-star-catherine-keener-eric-lange-jeff-ward-manny-jacinto-co-star-horror-adaptation-todd-grimson-1202787381/">Deadline</a> reports that <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/rosa-salazar-wants-to-play-alita-for-literally-the-rest-1836938683">Rosa Salazar</a>, alongside an excellent cast including <i>The Good Place</i>’s most charming Floridian, have signed on for Netflix’s <i>Brand New Cherry Flavor</i>, a new eight-episode series based on a horror novel by Todd Grimson.</p>
      <p>In it, Salazar (<a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/watch-alita-battle-angels-iron-city-get-built-from-the-1835922210"><i>Alita: Battle Angel</i></a>, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/amazons-undone-is-a-surreal-and-visually-stunning-serie-1837853277"><i>Undone</i></a>) will star as Lisa Nova, described by Deadline as “an aspiring film director... who embarks on a mind-altering journey — from the streets of Beverly Hills to the forests of Brazil — of supernatural revenge.” Sounds metal. Joining Salazar will be a fantastic cast, including Catherine Keener (<i>Get Out</i>), Eric Lange (<i>Escape at Dannemora</i>), Jeff Ward (<i>Agents of SHIELD</i>) and (!) Manny Jacinto (<i>The Good Place</i>).</p>
      <p>No word yet on the release date for the promising show, but it’ll be executive produced and written by Nick Antosca (<i>Channel Zero</i>) alongside Lenore Zion (<i>Billions, Channel Zero</i>). The first episode will be directed by Arkasha Stevenson, who was responsible for the direction of the third season of <i>Channel Zero</i>. I can’t wait for Rosa Salazar’s roaring rampage of revenge.</p>
