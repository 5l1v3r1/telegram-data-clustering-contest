      <p>Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher is known to love his football and is a huge fan of reigning Premier League champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>But he has clearly been keeping a keen eye on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United's</a> fortunes this season as well and the emergence of the Longstaff brothers have clearly caught his attention.</p>
      <p>Local lads <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sean-longstaff">Sean</a> and Matty have risen through the Academy ranks to star together in the Magpies' midfield this season and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/matty-longstaff">Matty</a> banged home the winning goal against Manchester City's fierce rivals Manchester United last month.</p>
      <p>And when talking to the crowd at last night's sold-out show at Newcastle's Utilita Arena, Gallagher wasted little time in paying tribute to the two brothers from North Shields.</p>
      <p>"Them two brothers. The two brothers who play for Newcastle," Gallagher began to cheers from the crowd.</p>
      <p>"We are having them right?"</p>
      <p>At this point some boos rained in from those in the arena who were clearly of a red-and-white persuasion as opposed to black-and-white.</p>
      <p>Gallagher replied to the boo-boys: "You are not having them? We are in Newcastle, right?"</p>
      <p>"Those two brothers, the ginger haired dude. We are having him!"</p>
      <p>The Oasis rocker then introduced solo track Paper Crown to the cheering crowd and you can watch his tribute to the Newcastle United duo at the top of the article.</p>
