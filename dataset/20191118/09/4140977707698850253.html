            <b>DEG Vs KAT Dream11, Probable Team, Pitch And Match Report: Loser of today’s encounter goes crashing out of the league as either side play their final group stage encounter.</b>
          </p>
          <p>With everyone in Group A of the exhibition T10 League slumped together of the two points apiece, Monday brings it massive ramifications for all the four sides in the group. The winners of the two remaining clashes of the day will end up deciding which sides make a foray into the dramatic land of the semi-finals and are able to exult in jubilant celebrations.</p>
          <p>Heading out to the middle with the same gripping narrative engulfing today’s opponents, both Deccan Gladiators and Karnataka Tuskers will be well aware that the margins for a win are going to be extremely fine for either side. This is a decisive tie and with the prize for the winner being so colossal, either will be looking to leave no stone unturned in a bid to canter their way into the ensuing round of the league.</p>

                <p>Deccan Gladiators make an advent into the forthcoming fixture having pulled off a useful run chase, one which saw them peel down the 109 run target by 4 wickets. To move into second place in Group A. Elsewhere, Karnataka Tuskers were handed over their first defeat of the league to make it the one win and one defeat apiece from two matches as the side were left in disarray despite scoring 114, a score their opponents chased down with 7 balls and 5 wickets in hand.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>The wickets at the T10 league began with fine batting tracks and they have retained their identity as well given the extremely short format of the encounters. We will be revelled in yet another pristine batting surface today and with this being the first match of the day to be contested here, the side winning the toss is bound to come out and bat first.</p>

                            <h3>DEG Vs KAT Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Karnataka Tuskers’ wicket-keeper and opener, Johnson Charles was an instant make for us in this docket of our side with the player coming fresh off an extradonaire knock of 57 runs in 28 balls which saw him smash his way to the eight boundaries.</p>
                            <p>We are getting in his counterpart Shafiqullah Shafiq as well with the number three bat being not only a safe pair of hands with a sublime bat as well, someone who doesn’t need much time to settle down and canter his way to a slew of runs. </p>
                            <h3>DEG Vs KAT Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Hashim Amla got 47 in the last encounter, putting on a stellar and stunning 97 run partnership in 8.2 overs alongside Johnson Charles. It was a stupendous partnership between the two openers, one the two can easily resonate today as well given the wavering identity of their opposition’s bowling unit.</p>
                            <p>From Karnataka Tuskers meanwhile we are going in with Upul Tharanga who scored an exquisite knock in the side’s league opener with Bhanuka Rajapaksa partnering him up for the day.</p>
                            <h3>DEG Vs KAT Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>We compensate for the bats from Deccan Gladiators in this segment of our side with our entire trivalent of picks from the unit in this docket being from the side. Our first name to immerse in was opener Shane Watson after his innings of 41 in 25 balls in the foregone contest saw him pile on the runs at will for his unit.</p>
                            <p>He will be partnered by Anton Devcich whose 27 runs saw him and Watson hold fort and put on an 82 run stand for the first wicket in the same match to see the side post a behemoth of a score. Ben Cutting has yet to impress with either the bat or ball but the player’s escalated role in both the units of the side’s gameplan will see him retain his place in our unit.</p>
                            <h3>DEG Vs KAT Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>In a match where both the sides went onto score over 100runs, Deccan Gladiators had to than Migael Pretorius immensely after the player ripped into the opposition with him astute wicket to wicket line and length leaving them flummoxed. It saw him earn massive rewards as he snagged the 3-10 to make the player an instant choice alongside Zahir Khan.</p>
                            <p>Pat Brown was ripped into in the last match but the bowler picked three wickets for his side in their league opener to see un entrust him for this encounter as well from Karnataka Tuskers.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to go with Charles as our captain for today while Watson will represent us as vice-captain.</p>
