      <p>A new radio station which will play music exclusively from the last decade is being launched.</p>
      <p>Absolute Radio 10s will review the 2010s with a special channel launching today.</p>
      <p>Tracks from Ed Sheeran, Drake, Coldplay and Kasabian will all be heard on the new station.</p>
      <p>It will sit alongside other Absolute stations dedicated to the best of past decades, from the 1960s onwards.</p>
      <p>Breakfast Show presenter Dave Berry said: "I'm like the Dr Who of radio as the only breakfast presenter at the helm of parallel universes.</p>
      <p>"My one live show is now partnered with no fewer than eight playlists to give listeners their favourite songs, no matter what their favourite decade is or what mood they're in.</p>
      <p>"I'm Jumping Jack Flash in the 60s, I'm Into the Groove in the 80s. I'm on Fire in the 10s."</p>
      <p>Absolute Radio 10s will broadcast Dave Berry on weekday Breakfast, Bush and Richie at Hometime and Frank Skinner and Jason Manford on weekend mornings.</p>
      <p>It makes use of the radio station's technology which gives one show a choice of eight playlists.</p>
      <p>Absolute Radio 10s launches at 10am today.</p>
