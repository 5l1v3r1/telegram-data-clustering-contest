      <p>NEW DELHI: The United States continues to be a popular destination for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-students">Indian students</a>, though fewer are flying out now because of unfriendly visa and immigration policies. Indian student population in the US went up marginally (2.9%) from 1.96 lakh in 2017-18 to 2.02 lakh in 2018-19, according to a new report. However, this figure is a cumulative number, which covers students across batches who enrolled in American universities over several preceding years.</p>
      <p>More indicative of the latest enrolment trends are the visa numbers released by the US state department, which suggest a steep slide in the number of Indian students opting for a US education or managing to get approvals.</p>

      <p>The number of student visas to Indians—who form a sizeable subset of total international student population—fell more than 40% from 74,831 in 2015 to 42,694 in 2018, said the US state department. Even globally, the number of student visas issued by the US decreased by close to 40% between 2015 and 2018.</p>
      <p>In all, the US now has 24,813 Indians at the undergraduate level, 90,333 in graduate programmes, 84,630 pursuing optional practical training (OPT), and 2,238 in non-degree courses. Decrease in admissions in business management was offset by a newfound fancy for maths and statistics, which leads to jobs in data analysis and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>Coursewise, Indian students pursuing maths and computer science make up the largest chunk (37%), overtaking engineering (34%) for the first time, data from Opendoors by the Institute of International Education shows. Undergraduate numbers have grown 6.3% and graduate numbers have shrunk (-5.6%), reversing a popular trend of many decades when students would seek admission for a masters in the US after graduating in engineering.</p>
      <p>Overall, the number of in-bound international students dipped in 2018-19 by 0.9% compared with 2017-18, which recorded a much sharper fall of 6.6%. Decline in fresh enrolment of international students continued in 2019-20 at the same pace (0.9%), according to data from the 2019 Fall International Student Enrolment Snapshot Survey.</p>
