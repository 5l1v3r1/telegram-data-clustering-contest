      <p>ITV bosses are set to warn Good Morning Britain and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> guests that they will be at risk of being victims of online bullying.</p>
      <p>In new rules, that came into fruition after the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeremy-kyle/">Jeremy Kyle</a> Show<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/14/jeremy-kyle-show-guest-steven-dymond-tragically-died-happened-9526114/"> guest Steven Dymond took his own life shortly after appearing on the show</a>, participants on both daytime programmes must take into consideration the threat of being targeted by trolls, according to reports.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been referred to as “vulnerability awareness”,’ a source said. ‘The aim is to make sure guests know exactly what they’re in for.’</p>
      <p>The insider continued to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10364878/itv-warn-guests-trolled-online/">The Sun</a>: ‘ITV know contentious topics and fiery exchanges make for good ratings but can stir up anger among viewers.’</p>
      <p>Last month,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/itv-insists-will-not-bring-back-jeremy-kyle-show-show-resembling-format-11019959/"> ITV said it will not bring back the now-cancelled Jeremy Kyle Show</a> or ‘any other show resembling its format’.</p>

      <p>It came in response to comments from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/mps-accuse-itv-failure-responsibility-towards-jeremy-kyle-show-guests-11019231/">accusing ITV of a ‘failure of responsibility’ towards its guests</a>.</p>

      <p>The DCMS Committee based its comments on the footage they say was shared with them by a whistleblower.</p>
      <p>In a statement to Metro.co.uk, ITV said: ‘We cannot comment on accusations based on footage the Select Committee has not shared with ITV.</p>
      <p>‘ITV cancelled The Jeremy Kyle Show in May. We have since made clear that we will not bring back the Jeremy Kyle Show, or any other show resembling its format.’</p>
      <p>The broadcaster also reiterated its dedication to duty of care for its guests and said in a statement.</p>
      <p>‘The physical and mental health of everyone we work with is our highest priority and ITV is committed to working across the industry – including with other broadcasters, PACT and our regulator Ofcom – to share best practice and continue to strengthen and evolve our Duty of Care processes,’ it read.</p>
      <p>The statement continued: ‘The participation of the public in television programmes has been right at the heart of TV since it began.</p>
      <p>‘We believe that these shows are all the better for the talent, energy and diversity of the members of the public who take part in them and we are committed to continuing to ensure that their welfare is also at the heart of what we do.’</p>
