      <p>With Disney Plus launched, more or less, a slow trickle of news related to Marvel’s <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/04/kevin-feige-finally-wants-to-make-good-on-the-mcu-tying-film-and-tv-worlds-together">upcoming TV shows</a> for the platform has begun. We still know very little about <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/06/we-love-this-blurry-yet-intriguing-glimpse-at-the-upcoming-loki-show">Loki’s series</a>, which will feature Tom Hiddleston reprising the role of the trickster Norse god he made his own in the <i>Avengers</i> and <i>Thor</i> movies. But at least we know one of the other stars now.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/loki-sophia-di-martino-tom-hiddleston-marvel-1203406777/">Variety</a> reports, Sophia Di Martino has signed on to join <i>Loki</i>. Di Martino, who recently had a major role in <i>Yesterday</i>, that movie about the Beatles, and also played on the Netflix series <i>Flowers</i>. Her role is, as of yet, unannounced, though rumour has it the plot will involve Loki <i>Doctor Who</i>-ing it up through history being his old chaotic self. Maybe Di Martino will be his ersatz companion? If it is a show with a highly changeable setting and scenario, it’ll need a couple people close to Loki for him to play off of. Seems reasonable to assume Di Martino will be one of them.</p>
      <p>The show, just called <i>Loki</i>, will be directed by Kate Herron (<i>Sex Education</i>), with Michael Waldron (<i>Rick and Morty</i>) writing the pilot and executive producing the series. Production should begin next year, and it’ll be out in the <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/07/marvel-just-revealed-release-dates-and-logos-for-its-disney-series">spring of 2021.</a> </p>
