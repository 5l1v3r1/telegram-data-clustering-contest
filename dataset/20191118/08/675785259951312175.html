      <h2>Chelsea put a £30m bid in for Sergio Aguero after he scored a brace in a Champions League game for Atletico Madrid against them but John Terry stopped the transfer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:32:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Sergio Aguero could have formed a superstar strike force with Didier Drogba at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> - but John Terry vetoed the signing.</p>
      <p>The Blues were searching for a front man to boost their aging attack in the summer of 2009 - with talisman Drogba and the previous season's top scorer Nicolas Anelka both over 30 years old.</p>
      <p>Then-Atletico Madrid striker Aguero seemed to fit the bill having crashed 19 and 17 goals in his previous two La Liga campaigns, to go alongside healthy returns in the Champions League and UEFA Cup.</p>
      <p>The west London outfit made enquiries to sign the promising Argentine in the 2009 summer but were put off by the £40million price tag, according to the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383439/2019/11/18/why-chelsea-missed-out-on-signing-aguero-despite-making-him-a-target-in-2009/?redirected=1&amp;redirected=1">Athletic.</a></p>

      <p>Then Chelsea and Atleti were drawn against each other in the Champions League group stages.</p>
      <p>In the match at Stamford Bridge, Aguero was shackled in a 4-0 defeat but in the reverse fixture in Spain, Aguero came off the bench to bag a brace - which included a last minute equaliser.</p>
      <p>That didn't impress Blues captain Terry, who held a huge sway at the club and wanted David Villa to be the top target.</p>
      <p>Terry said at the time: “I think we’ll see Chelsea back and competing for the top players who are out there at the moment. The likes of Franck Ribery, David Villa. These are the kind of players we want to attract.</p>

      <p>“Valencia are struggling for money, that’s well publicised when it comes to Villa, and there’s been a lot of talk about Ribery. We’ll be in for players in the summer, but when big players like them become available, we need to show people that, yes, Chelsea are back.</p>
      <p>“There needs to be a couple of changes, a few players brought in and a few who haven’t played in the last couple of years moved on. As players, we’ve said our feelings about what we feel needs to be improved. Hopefully Roman will listen and things will get done.”</p>
      <p>However, Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti was impressed and said: “I like him. I think Aguero can play with Drogba for sure.”</p>
      <p>It lead to the Blues stepping up their interest again ahead of the January 2010 transfer window, where they would make a £30m bid.</p>
      <p>Atleti rejected the offer, which was £10m away from their asking price, and Chelsea were keen to avoid paying Aguero's agent Bruno Satin a £5m fee.</p>
      <p>Chelsea ended up signing Daniel Sturridge, while Aguero spent another season in Madrid before moving to City.</p>
      <p>Aguero has stay in Manchester since and scored 244 goals in 353 appearances - picking up three Premier League winner's medals.</p>
