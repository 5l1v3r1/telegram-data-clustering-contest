      <p>Days after <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/right-handed-paul-adams-sri-lanka-spinner-kevin-koththigoda-bowling-action-watch-video-6123195/">Sri Lankan leggie Kevin Koththigoda</a> grabbed eyeballs with his bizarre bowling action, Cape Town Blitz’s spinner Gregory Mahlokwana is taking the internet by storm with his ambidextrous bowling skills. During a T20 match between Cape Town and Durban Heat in the ongoing Mzansi Super League, Mahlokwana surprised everyone by picking up wickets bowling with his left and right hand.</p>
      <p>The all-rounder first dismissed opener Sarel Erwee on 16 in the eighth over while bowling with the right-hand. He then dismantled the stumps of Durban skipper Dane Vilas in the tenth over, while bowling with left.</p>

      <p>After electing to bowl first, Durban got off to a decent start as they dismissed both Cape Town openers Quinton de Kock and Janneman Malan inside the powerplay overs. However, 43-run knocks by Marques Ackerman and Asif Ali helped their side post a challenging 174/6.</p>
      <p>In response, Durban lost opener Alex Hales for a duck in the first over. Wihan Lubbe kept Durban in the contest, but his 42 balls 83 went in vain as his side could only manage 164/7 in the 20 overs.</p>
