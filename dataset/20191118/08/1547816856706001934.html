      <p>Virat Kohli is extremely fit and that’s no secret. If you've ever read, known anything about him, or have taken a peek (in our case, stalk Virat) into his social media accounts, you'd know that Kohli is a proper a fitness freak who goes to any extreme to maintain that oh-so-chiselled physique. No matter how tough, demanding or hectic his schedule is, Virat will never miss his workout session for anything.</p>
      <p>From picking up weights to After making the most of his birthday cum mini-vacation in Bhutan, Virat is now gearing up to shed those a little holiday weight. So while you are stuffing your mouth with some delicious/ high on calories food, Virat, on the other hand, chose to rigorously sweat it out in the gym. Recently, the Indian skipper shared a video of himself on his Instagram account, telling us that there are ‘no days off’ when it comes to fitness. Watch this recent video below that might help you move your lazy ass and hit the gym right now.</p>

      <p>In the video, Virat is seen hanging on the bar while doing push up for his lower abs, in order to get perfectly toned abs. He is also seen clinging on his t-shirt while flaunting his already hot midriff. A few days, Virat had shared a promotional video where he is seen helping a man with his lateral overhead exercise. </p>
