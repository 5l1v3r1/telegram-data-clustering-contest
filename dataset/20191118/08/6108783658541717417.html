      <h3>2K has regained control of its social media pages at the time of writing.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/2k/">2K</a> has apologised for racist posts that appeared on channels for <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/wwe-2k20/">WWE 2K</a>, <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/">Civilization</a></i> and <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/borderlands-3/">Borderlands</a> </i>this past weekend as a result of a social media hack.</p>
      <p>“Social media accounts across the 2K label were compromised early Friday evening,” a 2K representative told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-16-2k-apologises-for-racist-social-media-posts-following-hack">Eurogamer</a>. “Unfortunately, offensive material was posted that does not reflect the values of 2K or our partners. We condemn these posts and apologise to everyone offended by the content.”</p>
      <p>While we won’t reproduce some of the racist material that was posted, the hack also changed the <i>WWE 2K20 </i>Facebook page to feature logos from All Elite Wrestling (AEW) alongside a banner photo of Chris Benoit, the late performer who took is own life after killing his wife and child in 2007.</p>
      <p>“There’s an employee out here refreshing and removing/updating the pic every time and he can’t do anything to stop it, let that sink in ladies and gentlemen,” a post from someone identifying themself as Nublom read during the social media hack. Nublom later refered to themself as “da goat” in a post that followed.</p>
      <p>The pages are all back to normal at the time of writing.</p>
