      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson will today offer British companies a series of tax cuts and breaks as he seeks to mend his relationship with the country’s firms.</p>

      <p>In a speech to the annual CBI conference in London Johnson will pledge to cut the taxes of more than half a million smaller businesses by raising the national insurance allowance from £3,000 to £4,000.</p>
      <p>He will also promise to reduce business rates, cut taxes on the construction industry, and review research and development tax credits.</p>
      <p>Many in the business community have been skeptical of Johnson’s commitment to corporate Britain since he was reported to have said “f*ck business” when asked about industry concerns over Brexit.</p>
      <p>Johnson will say today: “Let’s not beat around the bush, big business didn’t want Brexit. You made that clear in 2016 and this body said it louder than any other.”</p>
      <p>“But what is also clear is that what you want now – and have wanted for some time – is certainty.”</p>
      <p>He will say that leaving the European Union with a deal will mean businesses can focus on “spurring innovation, creating jobs, stimulating growth”.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is also speaking at the CBI conference. He could be in for a frosty reception after his plans to nationalise internet provider BT Openreach went down badly in the City.</p>
      <p>Corbyn is set to focus on reforming the apprenticeship levy, a concern of businesses, and tackling climate change.</p>
      <p>He will unveil plans to create a “climate apprenticeship programme” that Labour say will deliver 320,000 apprenticeships in England during its first term in government.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s pitch is to relieve the burden on businesses. As part of his plans, business rates would undergo a “fundamental review”.</p>

      <p>Tax relief on the purchase, building or leasing of a structure would be increased by one per cent. The Conservatives would also review the scope of R&amp;D tax credits and increase the rate by one per cent, Johnson will say.</p>
