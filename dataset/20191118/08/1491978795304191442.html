        <i>I wanted to prove I could compete with the men in the weights room. A slipped disc made me reassess my attitude to extreme accomplishments</i>
      </p>
      <p>I was never good at PE at school, nor interested in getting good at it. Somehow, I knew the best way to endure it was to be enthusiastically bad, overestimating my ability for a laugh or begrudging respect from a teacher. I would voluntarily do butterfly against the county swimming champions, purely because I found it funny.</p>
      <p>Secretly, maybe, I wished I was naturally sporty. In my early 20s, I had more important things to do than fitness (drinking and watching Mad Men), but by 25, I realised it was time to get moving. I tried running and the gym. Then, with the help of a powerfully shredded trainer, I discovered weightlifting.</p>
      <p>I like proving I can do things people might not expect of a young(ish) woman, things more often associated with big buff men. So I got the gloves and belt, and marvelled at how quickly my thighs turned to rock, yet felt like rubber when I bounced up an escalator. Lifting was like getting a mental scrub: every muscle fibre and shred of concentration united in exertion. I felt satisfaction at often being the only woman in the weights room.</p>
      <p>Yes, there was the shrieking horizon of pain expanding across the base of my spine, and it was becoming a struggle to stand up from my desk chair, but so what? I could lift more than I weighed. Watching the discs that crown the bar get bigger was a visible reward.</p>
      <p>And then – bet you didn’t see this coming – I did myself a massive mischief. While I was doing a goblet squat, that throbbing slab at the bottom of my back went thunk, in a dramatic, fleshy surrender. To make sure something really bad had happened, I tried pulling a big weight on another machine. Yes, something bad had happened – and I had probably just made it worse.</p>
      <p>Since I could no longer put my pants on from a standing position, I started physiotherapy, meeting weekly with a lovely woman who told me I had a slipped disc (also known as a herniated or prolapsed disc). As she dug her elbow into my bum (apparently almost devoid of muscle owing to the terrible technique that landed me face-down on her table), it appeared she could read my mind through my arse. Why did I feel I had to push myself to extremes? Had I been an overachieving child?</p>
      <p>The reasons that got me there became embarrassingly obvious. As a kid, I was not allowed to get away with doing less than 110% at school (other than in PE). And with two younger brothers, I was acutely aware of gendered unfairness and needed to prove I could outdo any boy. Into adulthood, I thought prolificacy could compensate for low professional self-esteem, and worked myself like an abused greyhound. Limits? Nah.</p>
      <p>My physiotherapist’s kind bafflement at my appalling need to be the best made me see how silly it was – especially at the gym, where I was only competing against myself. It was not just OK to listen to my body when it hurt or my mind when it short-circuited, it was key for long-term wellbeing, not to mention my wallet: I still have to have physiotherapy every eight weeks, and see a trainer who works with the physiotherapist to tailor sessions appropriately.</p>
      <p>Slipping a disc obviously is not a change I planned to make and, while it sometimes gets me out of doing the vacuuming, it is one I would reverse given the chance. But – not being particularly given to introspection – I doubt I would have stopped ragging myself in the name of meaningless accomplishments without being physically forced to.</p>
      <p>My back is mostly better – thanks in part to the careful development of some now cartoonish and very supportive bum muscles – but it will always be precarious, a constant reminder of what I now understand are acceptably human limitations. I tried a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_boxing">white-collar boxing</a> class this summer. It turned out to be a fetid industrial estate gym, all men bar me. I loved it. It was another extreme to conquer. But reason overpowered adrenaline: it was a bad idea to let blokes pound my puny hands as I took my turn holding the pads. I didn’t go back.</p>
      <p>Recently, my trainer said I could start lifting again, using a hex bar – a bigger frame that encourages better technique. All the old feelings returned, the exhilaration crackling through my muscles as I lifted 42kg, then 52kg. But I listen when he tells me not to lift more when I go to the gym independently. And I no longer take the gloves or belt, just my strongest attempt at common sense.</p>
