      <h1>146 security flaws uncovered in pre-installed Android apps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:19:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/ravie/" target="_blank">Ravie Lakshmanan</a></address>
      <p>Unless you’re purchasing a <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_4?hl=en-US">Pixel phone</a> — which promises a stock user experience — pre-installed apps from Android handset manufacturers are a given. Turns out, they’re not only bloatware, but are also full of security flaws.</p>
      <p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.kryptowire.com/android-firmware-2019/">Kryptowire have uncovered 146 security vulnerabilities</a> in pre-installed apps across 29 Android OEMs (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">original equipment manufacturers</a>), underscoring the vast scope of the problem.</p>
      <p>The shortcomings discovered in the study — funded by the Department of Homeland Security — range from unauthorized app installs to the ability to modify system and wireless settings, and even record audio.</p>
      <p>More troubling, it includes apps from some well-known OEMs like Asus, Samsung, and Xiaomi.</p>
      <p>Samsung disputed the findings <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/146-bugs-preinstalled-android-phones/">in a statement to Wired</a>, stating “we have promptly investigated the apps in question and have determined that appropriate protections are already in place.”</p>
      <p>Since last year, Google has leveraged a system called Build Test Suite (BTS) to scan for potentially harmful pre-installed apps across custom Android builds for devices that ship with its services.</p>
      <p>As the company explains in its “<a href="https://source.android.com/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_2018_Report_Final.pdf">Android Security 2018 Year in Review</a>” report released earlier this March:</p>
      <blockquote>OEMs submit their new or updated build images to BTS. BTS then runs a series of tests that look for security issues on the system image. One of these security tests scans for pre-installed PHAs included in the system image. If we find a PHA on the build, we work with the OEM partner to remediate and remove the PHA from the build before it can be offered to users.</blockquote>
      <p>But despite these security checks in place, questionable apps continue to slip through the cracks, as evidenced by Kryptowire’s research.</p>

      <p>What makes the present situation more insidious is the fact that these are OEM apps. When third-party apps downloaded by users are found to contain malware, they can at least be removed from the infected phones.</p>
      <p>With pre-installed apps, on the other hand, there is no option to get rid of the offended functionality. Worse, there’s no guarantee that OEMs will even issue a patch for older devices.</p>
      <p>Google, for its part, has been actively tring to weed out harmful apps from the platform. It recently <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/11/07/google-forges-new-app-defense-alliance-to-fix-android-malware-menace/">partnered with ESET, Lookout, and Zimperium</a> to identify shady third-party apps before they end up on users’ devices.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it’s time to apply the same stingent checks for OEM-made apps too.</p>
