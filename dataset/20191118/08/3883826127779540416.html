        <b>England all-rounder Ben Stokes is using Australia opener David Warner to sell his new book, says Australia captain Tim Paine.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/50422835">Stokes said Warner's comments to him</a> on the field inspired his match-winning innings in the third Ashes Test at Headingley in the summer.</p>
      <p>Asked whether it was a cheap shot by Stokes, Paine said: "Oh absolutely."</p>
      <p>He added: "It just seems to be a common trend in England that they like to use Davey's name to spike book sales."</p>
      <p>Stokes, who was dropped at slip by Warner, scored an unbeaten 135 as England completed their record run chase of 359 to record one of their <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/49465193">greatest victories</a>.</p>
      <p>"He just wouldn't shut up for most of my time out there," Stokes says of Warner, in his new book, 'On Fire'.</p>
      <p>"A few of the Aussies were being quite chirpy but, in particular, David Warner seemed to have his heart set on disrupting me.</p>
      <p>"I could accept it from just about any other opponent. Truly. Not from him, though."</p>
      <p>Paine added: "I was obviously standing next to David the whole time and you are allowed to talk on the cricket field.</p>
      <p>"But by no means was he abusing him or sledging him."</p>
      <p>Victory at Headlingley brought England level at 1-1 in the series, but Australia won the fourth Test to retain the Ashes before England won the final Test to draw the series 2-2.</p>
