      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Coming against favourable base effects, it will mark the slowest pace of growth since March 2013.”<br/> <br/>“We are also downgrading our FY20 (ending March 2020) growth to 5.1%, from 5.8% previously.”<br/> <br/>“We are cautious on a material improvement in the growth outlook in H2 FY20 as high-frequency <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> remain sluggish. We estimate the output gap to have widened to 0.8% of GDP in Q2 FY20 from 0.4% previously.”<br/> <br/>“We, therefore, maintain our call for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deliver another 50bps of cumulative cuts in the remainder of this fiscal year. A 25bp rate cut at the next policy review on 5 December appears imminent.”</p>
