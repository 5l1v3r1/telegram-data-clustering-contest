      <p>The Egyptian moved to the Midlands in the summer, joining from Turkish top-flight side Kasimpasa.</p>
      <p>And the 25-year-old says it is ‘amazing’ to find himself at the same club as countryman Ahmed Elmohamady.</p>
      <p>“I am loving it,” he said. “It’s a huge club, a good team and terrific supporters.</p>
      <p>“I think the fans are amazing – always positive.</p>
      <p>“They support us at the game if we win, lose or draw, they are always with us.</p>
      <p>“I always want to make them happy and I hope we do lots of times between now and the end of the season.</p>
      <p>“I used to speak to Elmo in the national team and I always used to say to him ‘I want to come to the Premier League and I want to join Aston Villa’.</p>
      <p>“It was a team I have always liked, I used to think ‘I’d like to join that club.’</p>
      <p>“Elmo used to smile but isn’t it amazing that we are both here now.</p>
      <p>“When I used to watch the Premier League in Egypt, I always used to follow Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>“It was a club I admired and liked.”</p>
      <p>The forward has scored two goals in his last two Premier League appearances, coming in the 2-1 losses at home to Liverpool and an injury-time strike away at Wolves.</p>
