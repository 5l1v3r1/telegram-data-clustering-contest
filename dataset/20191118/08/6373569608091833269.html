      <p>Police in Plymouth are investigating a van fire in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were called to Northesk Street at Stoke Village at 12.33am by a resident who initially thought a house was on fire.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said: "A fire appliance from Camels Head dealt with a van fire on a private driveway, just after midnight, following a call from a concerned resident of Northesk Street who reported smelling smoke and initially thought a house was on fire.</p>
      <p>"Our crew were on scene within minutes of the call and confirmed at 01:00hrs that they had extinguished it using a hose reel jet, small tools and a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots.</p>
      <p>"After making the vehicle and area safe, duty of care was left with the Police as the cause of the fire was confirmed as deliberate ignition."</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have been approached for comment.</p>
