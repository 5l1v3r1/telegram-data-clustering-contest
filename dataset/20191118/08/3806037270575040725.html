      <p>Shopping aggregate platform <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lyst">Lyst</a> just announced its Year in Fashion 2019 report, which gathers the year’s top fashion trends, viral products, hottest brands, successful collaborations and more into a single comprehensive guide. This year’s report even further solidified streetwear’s influence on mainstream fashion with mentions of brands in the space across all categories.</p>
      <p>In terms of notable brands, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/off-white">Off-White™</a> was crowned the most searched-for brand in 2019. <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/bottega-veneta">Bottega Veneta</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/pyer-moss">Pyer Moss</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/telfar">Telfar</a> were all named breakout brands of the year, while <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/marine-serre">Marine Serre</a> is predicted as a brand to watch in 2020. <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/virgil-abloh-ikea-markerad-collection-closer-look">Virgil Abloh x IKEA</a> was named one of the top collaborations this year, alongside <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/sacai-nike-ldwaffle-daybreak-collab-sneaker-colorways-on-feet">Sacai x Nike</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/supreme-stone-island-spring-summer-2019-closer-look">Supreme x Stone Island</a>. Overall, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/fendi">Fendi</a>‘s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/10/forever-fendi-monogram-cap">Zucca print</a> was the most coveted print this year.</p>
      <p>Lyst notes that customers spent an average of $192 USD for a pair of sneakers this year, which is a massive 39 percent increase from last year’s report. Additionally, the average price for a T-shirt increased 16 percent to $67 USD. According to the report, “2019 saw a 255% increase in traffic to luxury resale products on Lyst,” which falls in line with a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/gucci-yeezy-off-white-dominate-consignment-report">recent report</a> published by luxury resale platform <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/the-realreal">The RealReal</a>. Sustainability also appears to be on consumers’ minds as well, seen in part through a 52% search increase for “organic cotton.”</p>
      <p>When it comes to influential people in the overall fashion space, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/euphoria">Euphoria</a> actress <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/zendaya">Zendaya</a> and musician <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> made the list of top ten most powerful dressers in 2019.</p>
