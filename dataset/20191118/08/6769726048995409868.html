      <p>MANDURAH Fishability volunteers Terry Morey and Graham Welsh have shared the Patron’s Unsung Hero Award as a part of the Fishability Awards night.</p>
      <p>Mr Morey was one of the first volunteers in the schools’ program and worked with special needs students to provide inclusive fishing experiences, whereas Mr Welsh is a bit of a handyman for Fishability Mandurah, taking on any responsibility needed of him.</p>
      <p>His key role is to maintain and organise the fishing supplies trailer and the van used for school fishing clinics.</p>
      <p>While not in it for accolades, Mr Welsh said they accepted the award on behalf of all Fishability volunteers and volunteers in general because they all do great work.</p>
      <p>“I was shocked and a bit surprised… I just love fishing and helping,” Mr Welsh said.</p>
      <p>He encouraged anyone with spare time to help the “fantastic” Fishability program and feel the reward of helping people.</p>
      <p>The Fishability awards recognise people who provide recreational fishing for people of all abilities. A partner of Mandurah’s Fishability program, EarlyBird Bait, claimed the Chairman’s Award.</p>
