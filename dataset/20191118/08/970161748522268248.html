        <b>Gordon Ramsay definitely earned dad brownie points after hiring Ed Sheeran to perform at his daughter’s 18th birthday party over the weekend – and while it was claimed he ‘spared no expense’, it’s since been confirmed that Ed generously performed ‘as a favour’. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The TV chef celebrated the milestone birthday of his daughter Tilly, who actually turned 18 on 8 November, with friends and family on Saturday night including Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10364613/gordon-ramsay-tilly-ed-sheeran-18/">According to The Sun</a>, Gordon hired out London’s Cuckoo Club in Mayfair on Saturday night with a black tie <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bond/">James Bond</a> theme, making for quite the plush affair.</p>
      <p>While the birthday girl was no doubt the centre of attention, Tilly likely had to share the spotlight with one of the world’s biggest popstars.</p>
      <p>Ed, 28, popped up on the stage to perform a five-song set of his hit singles before leading the party into a rendition of Happy Birthday. Oh, and the singer rocked up with a neat new haircut too.</p>

      <p>A rep has since confirmed to <b>Metro.co.uk</b> that Ed performed as a ‘favour’ and that ‘no payment’ was made.</p>
      <p>It was previously said Gordon could have shelled out up to £500,000 for the Thinking Out Loud singer to perform, as it’s allegedly the amount Ed reportedly typically commands for private gigs.</p>

      <p>An insider had told the newspaper: ‘Tilly’s bash was next level. It was clear Gordon had spared no expense in making sure it really was a night to remember.</p>
      <p>‘Ed is Tilly’s favourite singer so it meant the world to her that he was there, even though his set didn’t come cheap.’</p>
      <p>The source continued: ‘The whole party had a James Bond theme, with drinks topped with her face or the 007 logo and guests encouraged to come in black tie. There was even a 007 ice sculpture which you could drink shots out of.’</p>
      <p>We’ll assume our invite was lost in the post.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the evening, Gordon and Tilly filmed a Tik Tok video together dressed in their casual clothes before waving their magic wand and suddenly being transformed into their black tie evening outfits.</p>

      <p>Tilly literally shone for the gods in a gold sequin strapless dress while Gordon, 53, looked dapper in a black tuxedo.</p>
      <p>Very 007.</p>
      <p>One person who was also likely in attendance was Tilly’s new boyfriend, Seth Mack, whom she celebrated her birthday with earlier in the month with a romantic trip abroad.</p>
      <p>It was previously reported that Tilly was dating Gina D’Acampo’s son Luciano but the real identity of her boyfriend was revealed when she shared a cosy snap from their getaway.</p>
