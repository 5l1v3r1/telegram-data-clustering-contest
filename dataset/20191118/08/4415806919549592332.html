      <h1>Sage Group sells payment arm to US firm Elavon for €270m</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:35:09+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Software business Sage has sold its payments service arm for £232m (€270m) to Elavon, a subsidiary of US firm Bancorp.</p>
      <p>The UK-listed firm told investors it had secured the deal to sell Sage Pay, three months after it announced plans to auction off the division.</p>
      <p>It was reported in September that Sage had appointed Rothschild to sell the business, which has around 50,000 small and medium-sized business customers.</p>
      <p>Sage Pay provides payment services to businesses in the UK and Ireland and the divested business will continue to partner with Sage following the deal, it said.</p>
      <p>For the year to September 2018, Sage Pay reported revenues of £41m (€47.8m) and an operating profit of £15m (€17.5m).</p>
      <p>Sage said it expects to report a statutory profit of approximately £180m (€209m) on the completion of the disposal.</p>
      <p>Sage chief executive Steve Hare said: “Our vision of becoming a great ‘software as a service’ company for customers and colleagues alike means we will continue to focus on serving small and medium-sized customers with subscription software solutions for accounting and financials, and people and payroll.</p>
      <p>“Payments and banking services remain an integral part of Sage’s value proposition and we will deliver them through our growing network of partnerships, including Elavon.”</p>
      <p>The transaction is due to be completed in the second quarter of next year.</p>
      <p>Completion of the deal will be subject to Elavon securing regulatory approval in the US and from the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Investors in Sage are awaiting the company’s full-year results on Thursday November 21.</p>
      <p>The results follow a warning from the business in July that its profit margin would be at the lower end of forecasts as legacy product sales fell faster than predicted.</p>
