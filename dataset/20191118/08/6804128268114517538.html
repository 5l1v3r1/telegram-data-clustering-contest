      <h1>Eden Hazard's bold Chelsea and Frank Lampard prediction that Blues fans will love</h1>
      <h2>Eden Hazard has been speaking about Frank Lampard and Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:35:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Eden Hazard has provided a glowing verdict on <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> and <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> after a strong start to the season for the Blues.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/eden-hazard">Hazard</a>, who previously played alongside Lampard during the latter's playing career, chose not to stick around for the beginning of his managerial career at the club and instead made the decision to join Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has endured a slow start to life at Real following his big-money move to Spain, with the Belgium star having scored just once in all competitions.</p>
      <p>However, his former club are on a high despite losing their best player in the summer. Many pundits and even Chelsea fans have been surprised by the form which has seen Lampard's men sit third in the Premier League ahead of the international break.</p>
      <p>Hazard, though, insists he is not one of those surprised onlookers as he continues to be impressed by Lampard and his old team, who he predicts are not far away from challenging for the title.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't surprised about Frank Lampard," Hazard said whilst on international duty with Belgium. "I know Frank as a player, not a manager, but he is a great guy.</p>
      <p>"He has shown already in four months that he can be one of the best managers in the world.</p>
      <p>"The good thing is they are playing with young English players. They are lucky to have young players with quality. Maybe with two or three more they would be first in the Premier League.</p>
