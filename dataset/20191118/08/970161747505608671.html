      <p>Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Asda will stop using black plastic in their products by the end of the year, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>The four major supermarkets will follow in the steps of Morrison’s which announced a ban on the hard to recycle material last week, The Grocer reported.</p>
      <p>Iceland and Aldi were also planning to drop black plastic from their own-label food and drink ranges by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>Currently, tens of thousands of tonnes of black plastic each year end up in landfill or being incinerated because it contains a carbon pigment that cannot be detected by recycling machines.</p>

      <p>Asda also recently announced it had removed 45 million ready meal trays containing black plastic from its range which it said alone removed ‘775 tonnes of previously unrecyclable plastic.’</p>
      <p>It plans to remove it all by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury’s was another supermarket on course for a full ban by the end of December – by which time 6,000 tonnes of material will have switched to recyclable alternatives.</p>
      <p>Waitrose said it had removed nearly 90% of the 2,291 tonnes of black plastic it uses as of the end of October and was ‘well on track’ to get rid of it fully by the end of December.</p>
      <p>The Co-op said the same thing meaning the material will have been removed from over 300 lines.</p>

      <p>Iceland head of recycling Stuart Lendrum said he expected his supermarket to have removed black plastic by the end of January next year.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘We have been making good progress with eliminating black plastic across the board.’</p>
      <p>The magazine said Marks &amp; Spencer is further behind but said it was on track to remove the material before the end of next year.</p>
      <p>Aldi also has a target of the end of 2020.</p>
