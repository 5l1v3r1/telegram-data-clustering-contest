        <b>An investigation is underway following the death of a young RNLI volunteer on Arranmore Island off County Donegal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>26-year-old Lee Early got trapped underwater when his car slipped off Poolawaddy Pier into the sea at around 5.10am yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>A passenger managed to get out of the car and swim ashore to raise the alarm.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>Newstalk Breakfast</i>, the RNLI's Area Lifesaving Manager Owen Medland says Lee's death is a huge loss to the community.</p>
      <p>He said: "Lee Early was a superb young man.</p>
      <blockquote>"He would be a loss to any community, but none more so than in a small island community where he really was part of the fabric of this community."</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Medland added: "The lifeboat crew, who I have to commend, responded to the incident and made every effort on Lee's behalf.</p>
      <p>"They're really in shock... but I think most importantly, and showing that spirit, they've maintained the lifeboat service on the island throughout."</p>
      <p>Local Donegal TD Pat the Cope Gallagher said the whole community is in shock.</p>
      <p>He observed: "When the news broke, a dark cloud descended over the island at the loss of this highly-regarded and popular young man from an island family."</p>
