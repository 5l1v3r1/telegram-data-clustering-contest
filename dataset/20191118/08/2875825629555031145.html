      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> host <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caroline-flack">Caroline Flack</a> shared with her 2.3 million followers her 13 hour flight to South Africa.</p>
      <p>The star, who recently celebrated her 40th birthday, jetted out to South Africa to film promos for the 2020 series of winter Love Island.</p>
      <p>She's been very open that she was dreading the lengthy haul - and it seems her fears came true with a flight delay and cancellation added to the mix.</p>
      <p>"Flight delay," she wrote on one snap as she reclined with a glass of wine.</p>
      <p>"Flight got cancelled," she groaned, "On way home...basically had a night out at Gatwick Airport."</p>
      <p>She had better luck the second time round, finally making it onto the plane.</p>
      <p>After she'd made it on board, blond locks tied into plaits, she shared a selfie with the caption: "Second time lucky...13 hour flight...face being looked after by @rodial and @elemis."</p>

      <p>"Made it on board...wish me luck," Caroline added.</p>
      <p>Despite the hassle, she seemed in good spirits as she beamed with a pal, writing: "Here we go!! #betterlatethannever. Love Island series 6 begins."</p>
      <p>Still, she made it to South Africa as she tagged a snap of a car journey at Pinelands, Cape Town.</p>
      <p>Last week, Caroline told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/">Metro</a> that she would have to be back and forth between the UK and South Africa when the series comes to telly screens, as she'll need to be filming for the dating hit's sister show, Aftersun.</p>
      <p>"I'm going on Saturday to do promo," she revealed, "I haven't packed anything yet. I always pack last minute.</p>

      <p>"It's a 13 hour flight to South Africa. I've got to go back and forth the whole time to do Aftersun over here."</p>
      <p>She last week celebrated her 40th in a glitzy, star-studded bash with mates and toyboy hunk Lewis Burton.</p>
      <p>The stars were lining up for the party, including Strictly pro couple Aljaz Skorjanec and Janette Manrara, hit maker Ella Eyre, model Ashley James and former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts.</p>
      <p>Lewis couldn't help put poke fun at their age gap, sharing a photo of Caroline with her guests alongside the caption: "Happy 90th baby."</p>
      <p>Rumours have been swirling that Caroline is engaged after the 27 year old was thought to have popped the question.</p>
      <p>Taking a stroll in the street, the blond beauty was snapped with a ring on her engagement finger - sparking fan speculation that she's bride to be.</p>
