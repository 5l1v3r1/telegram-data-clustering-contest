      <p>The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on Sunday commended Nigerian actors for their creative prowess in acting and inculcating morals in the public through plays.</p>
      <p>Mohammed gave the commendation late on Sunday night after a stage play, entitled: “Man Enough,” at the Terra Kulture Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos</p>
      <p>He said the efforts of Nigerian actors were appreciated based on their positive impact on fellow Nigerians and the creative industry.</p>
      <p>He said: “The talents I have seen so far in Nigerian actors and actresses render them capable to compete favourably with their colleagues in other climes.</p>
      <p>“The play was well presented, I’m quite impressed with the presentation and the morals a lot of people must have benefited from today.</p>
      <p>“This is a play that presents the challenges men go through on a daily basis and solutions were proffered to managing such challenges.”</p>
      <p>The lead actor of the play, Gideon Okeke, advised Nigerians to imbibe some virtues in the play in order to impart positively on people.</p>
      <p>Okeke said some of the virtues were: effective communication, expressing brotherly love to people around and care more for others.</p>
      <p>According to him, an act of kindness or love expressed towards a fellow human being could go a long way in improving an individual’s life.</p>
      <p>He also advised that people should learn to communicate effectively while they listen more.</p>
      <p>Okeke said: “People in the society react to issues differently and we are faced with different forms of challenges, which could be resolved or trivialised by a neighbour’s act of love and care.</p>
      <p>“We should learn to be our brother’s keeper and render helping hands to the needy because this could help others from being depressed, committing suicide or some other bad things.”</p>
