      <h2>She and her family now have to rent a home</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:00:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders, Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>Right-wing commentator and former reality TV star Katie Hopkins says she has had to sell her £1million home and move nto rented accommodated after a court case left her with virtually nothing.</p>
      <p>Hopkins, from Devon, rose to fame on The Apprentice then went into the jungle on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here as well as the Big Brother House.</p>
      <p>She went on to write columns and present TV and radio shows where she declared her extreme views.</p>
      <p>She no longer works for the Daily Mail or LBC, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-forced-sell-1m-20899416">The Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>Hopkins has now revealed she had to sell her family home to pay off a £500,000 legal bill after the writer Jack Monroe sued her for libel and won.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sunday Times, Hopkins said that speaking her mind lost her her career - having compared migrants crossing the Mediterranean in dinghies to "cockroaches" and claiming she'd use gunships to prevent people from landing on European shores.</p>

      <p>"I live in a rented, modern, four-bedroom detached house with my husband Mark and our three children, aged 15, 14 and 10," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's tucked out of the way for security reasons - our last home was rigged up to the local police station and had panic alarms fitted because of threats I received to my life.</p>
      <p>"I was forced to sell it for £950,000 in early 2018 to pay off a legal bill in excess of £500,000."</p>
      <p>Asked what her worst decision had been, she said: "Arguably, not settling the legal case brought against me.</p>
      <p>"I could have settled by giving £5,000 to a migrant charity but chose not to, and the ensuing court action and legal bills forced me to apply for an individual voluntary arrangement ."</p>
      <p>Che claimed she learned nothing from being on The Apprentice in 2007.</p>

      <p>Hopkins recently slated the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle , on Australia's Channel 9 documentary 60 Minutes.</p>
      <p>She said of Meghan: "There she is in her one-shoulder dress, being glowing. Because all she does is glow. Abdicate. Off you go.</p>
      <p>"She wears bad clothes, when did we ask for that?"</p>
