        <b>#ReleaseTheSnyderCut.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Justice League</i> stars Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck have called for the release of the film’s ‘Snyder Cut’, on the second anniversary of its debut.</p>
      <p>Affleck (Batman/Bruce Wayne), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman/Diana Prince) and Ray Fisher (Cyborg/Victor Stone) all prompted a huge reaction after tweeting #ReleaseTheSnyderCut.</p>
      <p>The ‘Snyder Cut’ refers to the original vision of director Zack Snyder, who was forced to leave the film after the death of his daughter Autumn, with <i>Avengers: Assemble</i> director Joss Whedon subsequently hired to oversee post-production and direct a further two months of reshoots.</p>

      <p>Their tweets shared an unseen look at the film, with Fisher releasing a photo of him in his football kit for Gotham City University, which is never depicted in the theatrical cut of<i> Justice League.</i></p>
      <p>Snyder himself later picked up on the support, tweeting: “This ancient Amazonian can’t be wrong”, in response to Gadot’s photo.</p>
      <p>Although the reason for the fresh support remains unclear, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/snyder-cut-ben-affleck-gal-gadot-call-new-justice-league-release-1255582">The Hollywood Reporter </a>claims that Warner Bros the studio has no immediate plans to release Snyder’s cut of Justice League.</p>

      <p>However, <a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/justice-league-snyder-cut-reportedly-coming-hbo-max/">We Got This Covered</a> has claimed that the Snyder Cut could ultimately appear on WarnerMedia’s upcoming HBO Max streaming service, with confirmation possibly happening at the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Last month, <i>Aquaman</i> actor Jason Momoa seemingly confirmed that the film existed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpd9GIHbbhQ">MTV News.</a></p>

      <p>“I have seen it. I have seen the Snyder Cut, so… think the public needs to see it,” Momoa said.</p>
      <p>“I’m obviously indebted to Warners and DC, and I don’t know how they feel about it. As a fan, I’m very, very happy that I got to see it.'”</p>
      <p>When Justice League was released on November 17, 2017, it was mauled by critics and made just $229 million domestic and $657.9 million worldwide, making it the lowest grossing movie in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gadot will return as Wonder Woman in <i>Wonder Woman: 1984</i> which is set for release next summer.</p>
