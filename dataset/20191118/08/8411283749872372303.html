      <h1>Nexcobot cooperates with AWS to simplify robot development</h1>

      <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has recently teamed up with robot developer Nexcobot to jointly develop a smart robotic solution, prodiving users from non-manufacturing industries with a modularized toolkit to reduce their learning curves and accelerate development of smart robots that suit their specific needs.</p>
      <p>Nexcobot, an affiliate of Nexcom Group, is primarily focusing on developing robotic arm products with an open platform, according to company general manager Jenny Shern.</p>
      <p>Shern pointed out that Nexcobot has received many inquiries from non-manufacturing industries, and expects demand from these areas to grow 15 times faster than that from conventional industries.</p>
      <p>However, for non-manufacturing industries to customize their robots for specific needs is a rather difficult task, and therefore, Nexcobot is hoping its cooperation with AWS can simplify the process. A combination of Nexcobot's Smart Robot Box with AWS' RoboMaker platform is expected to accelerate the development, testing and deployment processes.</p>
      <p>Users are allowed to develop and test robots via the cloud-based RoboMaker platform's simulation system and then synchronize their programs via Nexcobot's Smart Robot Box to their robotic arms or automated guided vehicles (AGV).</p>
      <p>So far, the biggest challenge in robotic application development is that there has not yet been an open standard and Nexcobot's Smart Robot Box with open architecture is able to resolve such a problem as most mainstream robot products available in the market are all supported by Smart Robot Box.</p>
