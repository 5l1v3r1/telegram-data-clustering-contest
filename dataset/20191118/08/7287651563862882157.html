      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14710"/>Next week Ryzen Threadripper 3000 will be unleashed, and that means it is stock clearing time. If you already purchased an X399 setup, now might be the time to pick up and upgrade towards a Gen1 or Gen2 Threadripper for cheap. </p>
      <p>If you look around in the need for many thread processors, at etailers you'll notice that there are some pretty interesting deals available. It could be the right time to pick one up if you can get an X399 motherboard on the cheap and need many threads and PCIe lanes. So we're not talking gaming here okay? The first-gen 8-core 1900X costs around 200 euros pretty much the price of a Ryzen 5 3600. The 1920X and the 2920X sell at 250 and 390 euros (where 800 and 650 euros at launch). The 1950X with 16 cores has also dropped considerably towards 533 EUR. Other chips, such as the 2590X, 2970WX and 2990WX, are quite steady on pricing.</p>
      <p>In the US prices are reduced even further: at the online retailer Newegg, the 1900X is available for $150 as part of a Black Friday deal.</p>
      <p>If interested, keep an eye out on pricing as it might drop even further.</p>
