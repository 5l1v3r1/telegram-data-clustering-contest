      <h1>Euronext and SIX vie for Spanish bourse BME</h1>
      <h2>Swiss exchange agrees €2.8bn deal but Paris-based operator also begins talks </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:13:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">Philip Stafford</a></address>
      <p>SIX Group, owner of the Swiss exchange, is offering to buy Spain’s BME for €2.8bn, aiming to fend off a rival approach from Euronext for the Madrid stock exchange.</p>
      <p>The flurry of bid interest in the BME on Monday comes as consolidation sweeps across the industry in Europe. Low market volatility and fierce competition in equities trading has squeezed exchanges’ profitability, pushing them to look to new markets or cut costs.</p>
      <p>BME and SIX, which have many similar markets and customers, confirmed on Monday a deal was before shareholders following weeks of talks. </p>
      <p>Euronext, which has considered an offer for BME and held brief conversations in the past, said on Monday it had opened talks with the Spanish group’s board. Shares in BME soared more than 37 per cent to €35 at the open in Madrid as investors anticipated a bidding war.</p>
      <p>SIX plans to make an all-cash voluntary tender offer to create the third-largest financial markets infrastructure group in Europe, behind the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse.</p>
      <p>The offer of €34 a share is a 33 per cent premium to BME’s closing price on Friday of €25.40, which valued BME at €2.1bn.</p>
      <p>Although profitability in trading has been pinched, investors have backed exchanges that have diversified into markets such as data and clearing. SIX, which is privately owned by its users, had built up a cash pile of more than SFr3.8bn ($3.8bn) through the sale of in-demand assets such as its payments services unit. Payments is SIX’s biggest and most profitable subsidiary.</p>
      <p>BME said it had backed the comitments SIX made to Spanish authorities to maintain BME’s listings, use Madrid as the platform for its EU business and give BME a “sufficient degree of independence” from SIX.</p>
      <p>SIX also said it had filed an application with Spanish regulators to authorise the closure of BME to further offers. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year.</p>
      <p>“A combination with BME will bring direct and immediate benefits to the stakeholders of both our institutions at a time when consolidation in global financial markets infrastructure is accelerating,” said Romeo Lacher, SIX chairman.</p>
      <p>This month both Euronext and BME denied they were in talks. On Monday Euronext said the two companies had started discussions.</p>
      <p>“Euronext confirms that it is now in talks with the board of directors of BME, which may or may not lead to an offer being made,” Euronext said, confirming a weekend report by the Spain-based Europa Press. </p>
      <p>Success for Euronext would extend its push to consolidate many of the former monopoly exchanges under one umbrella company. Euronext owns the main exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, Dublin and Oslo.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley advised BME. Credit Suisse advised SIX.</p>
      <p>Consolidation in the industry was kick-started in August by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b724de8a-b1d7-11e9-bec9-fdcab53d6959">LSE’s $27bn deal to buy Refinitiv</a>, the data and trading group.</p>
