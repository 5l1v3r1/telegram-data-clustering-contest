      <h2>The ease in rain has led to areas starting to clear of surface water</h2>

      <p>Busy roads in and around Burton and Swadlincote are once again open this morning after flooding hit the area hard last week.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/weather">constant rain had led</a> to problems across the area, with drivers having to find alternative routes to get about as many roads were closed due to being under water.</p>
      <p>Drivers heading through Walton again experienced major problems as Station Lane flooded at the weekend and was not passable for those wanting to get through.</p>
      <p>Those trying to find another route also had to avoid Croxhall Road, near Catton Park, due to flood water, which led to <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">busy traffic through Stapenhill</a> with drivers avoiding the flood water.</p>
      <p>Last week there were also issues in Rolleston, Repton and Barton as the downpours led to brooks bursting their bans and major problems with standing surface water.</p>
      <p>The good news this morning is that all roads are now open as the water has receded and drivers can go about their normal Monday morning routine.</p>
      <p>However, Conkers Discovery Park, in Moira, remains closed until Wednesday, November 20, due to the "natural lake breaching its banks".</p>
