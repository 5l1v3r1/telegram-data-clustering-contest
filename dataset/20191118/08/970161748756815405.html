        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> will face serious competition if they want to continue their pursuit of Inter Milan’s with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fc-barcelona/">Barcelona</a> both showing interest in the defender.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has been a fixture in the Inter side since arriving from Sampdoria in 2017 and has started all 12 Serie A games so far this season as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/antonio-conte/">Antonio Conte</a>’s side look to challenge Juventus at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>The commanding and tough-tackling centre-back has already won 30 caps for Slovakia and is attracting the attention of some of Europe’s biggest clubs.</p>
      <p>United showed their interest over the summer and they attempted to make Skriniar a part of the deal that took Romelu Lukaku to Inter, but the Italians rejected the suggestion.</p>
      <p>Italian publication <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/17-63459677/inter_real_e_barcellona_allassalto_per_skriniar/">Corriere dello Sport</a> reports that Real Madrid and Barcelona will be part of any battle to sign him in January, or more likely, next summer.</p>

      <p>With interest from such huge clubs and with the defender signing a new contract over the summer, keeping him tied to Inter till 2023, he will be a very expensive option for any side.</p>
      <p>Inter were not interested in offers of around £50m last summer, so will not be willing to accept similar bids next year.</p>
      <p>Skriniar does not have a release clause in his new contract in Milan, meaning a bidding war could reach huge values for the in-demand defender.</p>
      <p>Whether Manchester United will be keen to get embroiled in a battle with Real and Barca is yet to be seen as they spent £80m on Harry Maguire over the summer and seem to be invested in the central defensive partnership he is forming with Victor Lindelof.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are also looking to strengthen in midfield and attack, seemingly more than in defence, with the likes of James Maddison, Jack Grealish, Jadon Sancho, Moussa Dembele John McGinn and Declan Rice all linked with moves to Old Trafford.</p>
