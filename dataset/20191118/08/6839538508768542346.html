      <p>A favourite overseas destination for West Aussies has been named on the annual No List for travel in 2020, as the Go List delivers some unexpected gems for your next holiday bucket list.</p>
      <p>According to travel bible Fodor, Bali - the most visited Indonesian island - has been listed as a ‘no go’ destination for the year ahead.</p>
      <p>With flights to Indonesia costing Perth holidaymakers less than a flight over East - or even to destinations like Broome in our own state - it’s no surprise Bali has been a frequent destination for WA travellers.</p>
      <p>But over-tourism has crippled the island - from devastating effects on the environment to disrespectful behaviour from tourists causing a rift between locals and foreigners - landing Bali on the list under The Places That Don’t Want You (or Want You in Smaller Doses)’.</p>
      <p>Other popular tourist areas listed in that category include Barcelona in Spain, Big Sur in the United States, UNESCO World Heritage Site Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Hanoi Train Street in Vietnam.</p>

      <p>Although daredevil travellers are sure to underline this destination on their bucket lists rather than scratch it off, Matterhorn - the infamous Swiss mountain peak that has claimed the lives of seven climbers this year alone - is the sole destination named The Place That Could Kill You on the 2020 No List.</p>
      <p>Another location given its own category on the list, Thailand has been named and shamed for the popular tourist practice of elephant riding as The Tourist Attraction That Needs to Stop.</p>
      <p>The publication credits the ‘reflection and re-evaluation that comes to every industry’ as the reasoning behind naming the practice on their list, as the demand for elephant rides in Thailand surge due to an influx of tourists to the region.</p>
      <p>But don’t cancel your annual leave request just yet, as Fodor have also named a plethora of destinations worthy of a stamp on your passport.</p>

      <p>While the capital city of Greece usually has an abundance of travellers passing through on their way to explore the Aegean Sea, Fodor recommends spending time in Athens exploring the ‘vibrant, artistic, cultural and gastronomic metropolis’.</p>
      <p>Athens is named twice on this list, but while the port city is known for its ancient historical structures, Athens, Georgia, is a college town known for its laid-back vibe and thriving creative community.</p>
      <p>If an American road-trip is on the agenda, Fodor also recommends stops in Baltimore, Palm Springs, Portland, Queens, South Walton and Sun Valley during a US visit.</p>
      <p>Across the border, Vancouver Island and Newfoundland were named Canada’s top destinations.</p>
      <p>After bracing itself for an influx of tourists heading to the world’s biggest sporting event, Tokyo is ready to take centre stage next year as it hosts the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.</p>

      <p>With an estimated 600,000 people expected to visit Tokyo during the summer games, they will discover a metropolis brimming with an explosion Japanese culture you’re unlikely to see in one place anywhere else.</p>
      <p>Closer to home, Australia and the Pacific have just three destinations named between them - but anyone who has been to the French Polynesia, New Zealand and Australia could tell you they are more than deserving of their praise.</p>
      <p>Bora Bora, famous for its luxury villas perched on crystal-clear waters, is a hotspot for honeymooners and celebrities around the world.</p>
      <p>In the past, the island oasis came with a price tag worthy of a spot on the ‘if I win the lotto’ list, but new family-run lodges opening up have meant a budget-friendly version is now an affordable choice for those without a winning ticket.</p>

      <p>Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand city of Christchurch has bounced back from recent tragedies - including devastating earthquakes in 2010-11 and tragic mass shootings early in the year - to a tourist paradise.</p>
      <p>Botanic gardens, an exploding public arts scene and colonial-era British architecture are just some of the highlights of this re-emerging metropolis.</p>
      <p>Despite our own backyard having an endless amount of destinations worthy of a spot on the 2020 list, Australia has only one city featured - and to our shock and displeasure, it’s not Rotto.</p>
      <p>Brisbane has been named the Go To destination for travellers heading to Australia in 2020.</p>
      <p>Described as having ‘Vancouver-meets-Santa Barbara’ vibes, the Queensland city offers visitors a chance to “partake in the typically great Australian experience in an extremely laid-back scene”, according to Fodor.</p>
