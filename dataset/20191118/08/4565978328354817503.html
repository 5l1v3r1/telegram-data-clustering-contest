      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- They attended a solidarity meeting with representatives of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples (ICAP) and executives of the Doctor Ernesto Guevara de la Serna General Teaching Hospital, in this eastern Cuban province.</p>
      <p>"We have different cultures in my country, we are children of a mixture of cultures; yes, but we are all Bolivians, we are all Bolivia. I call on international movements to unite for the peace of my country. I call for unity; what hurts us today it is happening with our people there, with families," says Dr. Simón Max Untoja, a dermatologist, who is also the representative of the South American nation in Las Tunas.</p>
      <p>"Evo brought equity, equal opportunities for those who were forgotten in Bolivia. He gave dignity to the poorest class in our country. He is a hardworking and humble man, always with the people. He gave Bolivians rights that we did not have before. We are attacked by those who do not want my country to progress with social equality, "Eduhim Tintaya Velázquez, a neurosurgeon in training in Cuba, told the press.</p>
      <p>From the House of Friendship in Las Tunas, in parallel - and in support of the people of Bolivia and these young people of the sister nation - solidarity movements from several continents are integrated.</p>
      <p>"Since the political situation in Bolivia was known, we are dedicated to seeking international support, for the safety of Evo and for the peace of that country. From Italy, Finland, Canada, Martinique, Costa Rica, France ..., so many nations have transmitted their strength and unity to us in these moments of political aggression that Bolivia is experiencing. We are coordinated through social media, asserting the Bolivian truth, silenced by other information channels," María Romero, ICAP delegate in Las Tunas, said.</p>
      <p>The ICAP Las Tunas institutional profiles on <b>Facebook</b> and <b>Twitter</b> have more than 11 thousand contacts of friends and solidarity movements, as well as progressive organizations. In these platforms, the voices for peace in Bolivia and its sovereignty are also united.</p>
