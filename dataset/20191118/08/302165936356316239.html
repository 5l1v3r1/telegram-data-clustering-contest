      <p>TBILISI, Nov 18 — The United States and European Union expressed solidarity today with Georgia’s anti-government protesters who took to the streets after the ruling party backtracked on promises of electoral reforms.</p>
      <p>In the biggest anti-government protest in years, more than 20,000 demonstrators rallied yesterday outside the parliament building in the capital Tbilisi urging the government to resign and calling for new legislative elections.</p>
      <p>In a joint statement, the US and EU embassies said they “recognise the deep disappointment of a wide segment of Georgian society at the failure of parliament to pass the constitutional amendments required to move to fully proportional parliamentary elections in 2020.”</p>
      <p>“We fully support the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,” the missions said.</p>
      <p>The rally dispersed peacefully on Sunday night but entrances to the parliament building remain blocked by dozens of protesters who say no lawmakers will be allowed to pass through.</p>
      <p>At an earlier protest on Thursday, some 10,000 people rallied in Tbilisi, vowing to press ahead with “permanent” protests until their demands for snap polls are met.</p>
      <p>Opposition parties called for the rallies after forming a rare united front against the ruling Georgian Dream party, whose MPs last week voted down legislation to hold parliamentary elections next year under a new proportional voting system.</p>
      <p>The opposition accused powerful oligarch and Georgian Dream leader Bidzina Ivanishvili—who is widely believed to be the man in charge in Georgia—of being behind the move.</p>
      <p>The US and EU embassies said the failure to pass the legislation “has increased mistrust and heightened tensions between the ruling party and other political parties and civil society.”</p>
      <p>Protesters say the ruling party unfairly benefits from the current voting system.</p>
      <p>The Georgian Dream won nearly 77 per cent of seats in the 2016 parliamentary election despite garnering only 48.7 per cent of the vote.</p>
      <p>Opposition parties at the time denounced the polls as rigged.</p>
      <p>In power since 2012, the ruling party has seen its popularity plummet amid widespread discontent over economic stagnation and perceived backsliding on its commitment to democracy.</p>
      <p>Critics have accused Ivanishvili of persecuting political opponents, suffocating critical media, and creating a corrupt political system where his private interests dominate government decision-making. — AFP</p>
