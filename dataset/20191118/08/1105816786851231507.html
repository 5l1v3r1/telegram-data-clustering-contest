      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:38:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of the Shaheen-1 ballistic missile, said a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
      <p>The training launch came a day after Pakistan’s arch-rival India conducted the first night trial of nuclear-capable intermediate-range Agni-II ballistic missile.</p>
      <p>The Shaheen -1 is classified as a surface-to-surface ballistic missile, with a range of 650 kilometres. The missile can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads.</p>

      <p>“The launch was conducted as part of a Training Exercise, which was aimed at testing the operational readiness of Army Strategic Forces Command.”</p>
      <p>The military’s media wing added that troops of the Army’s strategic forces displayed a high standard of proficiency in handling potent missile system.</p>
      <p>“The training launch was witnessed by Director General Strategic Plans Division, Commander Army Strategic Forces Command, Chairman NESCOM, senior officers from Strategic Plans Division, Army Strategic Forces Command, scientists and engineers,” said ISPR.</p>
      <p>Earlier in May, the military conducted a successful training launch of the Shaheen-II surface-to-surface ballistic missile.</p>
      <p>The test was in response to India testing the hypersonic Brahmos missile.</p>
