      <p><b>Clann na nGael completed a league and championship double at Dunganny on Sunday when they edged out Na Fianna by 2-16 to 2-14 in a thrilling A HL Div 2 final.</b><br/>The Athboy/Rathcairn men won the Meath IHC title in October and added the league crown in impressive fashion as they came from behind to see off senior opponents Na Fianna.<br/>The winners started well and used the breeze to good effect to open up a 0-4 to 0-1 lead, but Barry slevin's goal cancelled out that good start and even though Clann na nGael did get their noses ahead again with Calum O'Sullivan in magnificent form they were pegged back by a second goal from Sean Martin as Na Fianna were level at the break 2-5 to 0-11.<br/>When Ciaran Garry flicked O'Sullivan's sideline cut to the net within seconds of the restart it put Clann na nGael back in the driving seat, but the impact of substitutes Ethan Devine and Will Flynn, added to the excellence of Slevin, saw Na Fianna pull 2-11 to 1-12 clear with 12 minutes remaining and they looked good.<br/>However Clann na nGael replied with a goal from Eamonn O Donnchadha and they never looked back from there as O'Sullivan excelled to inspire them to yet more silverware.<br/><i><b>Full match report and reaction from manager Kevin McGovern in Tuesday evening's Meath Chronicle.</b></i></p>
