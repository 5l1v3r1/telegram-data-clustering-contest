      <p>With the Christmas party season coming up, it can be a nightmare to get a taxi home.</p>
      <p>So when someone offers to be the designated driver, we should celebrate them.</p>
      <p>That’s why Coca Cola and Greene King are teaming up for the 10th year to give drivers a free soft drink throughout the festive season.</p>
      <p>Yes, the scheme has been going for a long time but for anyone who doesn’t know about it (or if you just need a reminder every year), you get a voucher for buy one drink, get one free drink when you show your keys at one of 1,000 Greene King pubs across the UK.</p>
      <p>For the first time, Heineken has joined the scheme to give away alcohol-free beer too.</p>
      <p>The companies want to encourage people not to drink and drive by offering them a drink that helps them feel included in the festivities.</p>

      <p>Phil Thomas, Chief Commercial Officer at Greene King, said: ‘As a leading pub company, we have an important role to play in helping to promote responsible drinking and we have given away around a quarter of a million free Coca-Cola products over the past decade as part of the Designated Driver campaign.’</p>
      <p>Paul Robertson, Associate Director, On-Premise at Coca-Cola European Partners GB, said: ‘We’d like to thank Greene King for partnering with us for the last 10 years on the Designated Driver campaign and continuing to evolve the platform to ensure it remains relevant to today’s consumers.</p>
      <p>‘Greene King should be applauded for its continued leadership in helping to promote responsible drinking and embracing the role soft drinks can play across its estate, especially on the lead up to Christmas. Here’s to another 10 years of partnership.’</p>
      <p>The offer is available at Greene King pubs across the UK, including Hungry Horse, Chef &amp; Brewer and Farmhouse Inns from now until 1 January 2020.</p>
      <p>Show your car keys at the bar and buy a Heineken 0.0, any 330ml bottle of Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar or 275ml Appletiser to get a voucher for your next purchase.</p>
