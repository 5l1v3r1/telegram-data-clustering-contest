        <b>Latvia is in celebratory mood November 18 on the occasion of its independence day, with ceremonies, events and parties planned to mark 101 years since the proclamation of the independent Latvian state on November 18, 1918.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The centerpieces of the celebrations as usual are the military parade beside the Daugava river in Rīga and a speech by President Egils Levits.</p>
      <p>Some events will be available to watch via the <a href="https://replay.lsm.lv/lv/programma/ltv1">LTV online service</a> [geoblocking may apply in some territories].</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš tweeted a message saying Latvians were privileged to have their own country where they could live in freedom and should be proud of that fact while working together for the future.</p>

      <p>President Gitanas Nausėda of Lithuania also extended congratulations to President Egils Levits and the people of Latvia celebrating the 101st anniversary of independence.</p>
      <blockquote>“Our people are closely connected by the bonds of neighborhood, the Baltic tradition and shared historical experience on the path to independence. Next year, Lithuania and Latvia will celebrate 30 meaningful years of reestablished national statehood. I am confident that the Lithuanian-Latvian friendship built on shared values will grow increasingly stronger, opening new avenues for joint initiatives in culture, arts, science, and business,” President Nausėda wrote in his message of congratulations.</blockquote>
