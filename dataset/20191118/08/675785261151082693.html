      <h1>Man Utd target Erling Haaland 'rejected' by Everton after bargain transfer agreed</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd are eyeing Red Bull Salzburg star Erling Haaland, but the poacher has already been turned down by Everton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:40:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Erling Haaland's exploits this season with Red Bull Salzburg have made him one of Europe's most sought after talents.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are keen on bringing the Norwegian to Old Trafford, but face competition from a host of leading lights around the continent.</p>
      <p>But had it not been for Everton's reluctance Haaland might already be tearing up the Premier League with the Toffees.</p>
      <p>David Walsh, who was axed from Merseyside 18 months ago, moved from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> after helping lead their incredible Premier League triumph three-years-ago thanks to his savvy recruitment.</p>
      <p>A little-known N'Golo Kante arrived from Caen for just over £5m and was crucial in the most unlikeliest of title charges.</p>
      <p>But Walsh wasn't able to work the same magic at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> which he puts down to the club's attitude in the transfer market.</p>

      <p>Haaland was on his way to Goodison Park - but the club turned down the deal and did likewise with Liverpool's assist machine Andrew Robertson before he moved to Anfield.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">Walsh told the Athletic</a> : “While I was at Everton, I offered them Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire deals, when they were at Hull, and it was worth £20 million for the pair. Everton wouldn’t take them.</p>
      <p>“I had a deal done for Jonny Evans too before he came to Leicester, but again they wouldn’t take him. Erling Haaland, the striker with Salzburg, I had him and his dad at the club with a deal done for £3.4m (€4m). The club wouldn’t back me.”</p>

      <p>Everton though have been happy to throw the cash about over the past few seasons - Ronald Koeman was sufficiently backed shortly before he was sacked.</p>
      <p>Marco Silva, who is into his second year in charge, has been allowed to sign the likes of Richarlison, Alex Iwobi and Moise Kean.</p>
      <p>Yet the Toffees are struggling in the bottom half of the table with pressure mounting on their Portuguese manager.</p>
