      <h1>Xherdan Shaqiri: Arsenal and Tottenham will want winger, claims Darren Bent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:41:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>With Xherdan Shaqiri being linked with a move away from Liverpool due to a lack of playing time, Darren Bent has spoken on the potential destinations that the Swiss international could end up at.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri has not featured a lot this season – playing 14 minutes to be exact – but it has to be said that is as much because of injury than anything else.</p>
      <p>Bent told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-bent-tips-tottenham-and-arsenal-to-battle-for-liverpool-player-who-wants-2020-exit/">Football Insider</a>: <b>“I think there will be no shortage of takers so he has nothing to fear about that. I think Arsenal would probably take him… Spurs may potentially take him as well.”</b></p>
      <p>Shaqiri would have played in the Carabao Cup had he not been out with an injury issue and could have seen more Premier League minutes too had he been fit.</p>
      <p>Between now and Christmas, before the January transfer window opens, Shaqiri’s situation will become clearer as long as he is fit. If he’s not injured, he will surely get a few chances with so many matches to come once club football comes back.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s league game at Crystal Palace kicks off a run of around six weeks with a game every few days – or even two matches in two days in the case of the Carabao Cup clash against Aston Villa and then the Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>If Shaqiri is fit, there is no doubt he will be given a chance to shine by Jurgen Klopp during that period – the German won’t have a choice but to rotate.</p>
