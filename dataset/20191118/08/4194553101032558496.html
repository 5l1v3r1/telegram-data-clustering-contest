      <h1>‘Blood on his waistcoat’ Many Reds angry at Southgate for Oxlade-Chamberlain decision</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:51:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain got through England’s win yesterday v Kosovo – and registered an assist in the 4-0 win.</p>
      <p>But he also started and scored in the midweek game v Montenegro – meaning Gareth Southgate selected him from the outset two times in a matter of days.</p>
      <p>This is something Jurgen Klopp hasn’t done once since Ox returned from his horrible injury – but England’s manager did at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s midfielder, who has six goals/assists in his last five starts, was on the floor on two occasions in Kosovo, but the ankle roll was thankfully nothing serious – with Reds worldwide watching from behind their hands…</p>
      <p>Many Reds on Twitter thought Southgate’s decision to start Ox in both games was reckless, especially considering how carefully Liverpool have navigated his rehab and comeback to regular football.</p>
      <p>At EOTK, we actually think the minutes will have done him good – but don’t expect him to start at Selhurst Park this coming weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here’s some of what’s been said online:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Klopp will be absolutely furious if Ox returns with an injury. Jürgen’s been so careful with Ox’s recovery, only playing him once a week and managing his training regime. Southgate then decides to play him twice in the space of 3 days with heavy training in between 🤡<br/>— Josh (@LFCJosh23) <a href="https://twitter.com/LFCJosh23/status/1196113100623220736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Why on earth does Southgate need to pick Trent and Ox. AWB and Foden both need international game time.<br/>— RobJo (@katealex4700) <a href="https://twitter.com/katealex4700/status/1196095463650447360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>FFS can southgate take Ox off already. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KOSENG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KOSENG<br/></a>— Kastor LFC (@KastorLfc) <a href="https://twitter.com/KastorLfc/status/1196113954591911937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Southgate starting Ox in 2 games in a week when Klopp refuses to play him that much yet and Trent playing again when he needs rest, in an irrelevant game because England have already qualified for Euro 2020… I hate international football<br/>— isabella (@trentsrobbo) <a href="https://twitter.com/trentsrobbo/status/1196096363005652995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Klopp hasn’t dared to start Ox twice in one week since his injury but Southgate is doing it for a dead rubber, he’s got blood on his waistcoat.<br/>— Sxncho (@ShahRahman1712) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShahRahman1712/status/1196119488783167494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>
