      <p><b>The American Heart Association</b> has unveiled a <b>Hands-Only CPR</b> training kiosk at <b>Seattle-Tacoma International Airport </b>(SEA) in advance of the busy holiday travel season. The Hands-Only CPR training kiosk, operated by the American Heart Association with the generous support of MultiCare Pulse Heart Institute, will train and test travelers on the lifesaving skill of Hands-Only CPR in about five minutes. The kiosk, located in the Central Terminal, includes a touch screen display with a video introduction and tutorial, followed by an interactive practice session and a 30-second test to measure efficacy. With the help of a practice manikin, or a rubber torso, the kiosk gives feedback about the depth and rate of compressions and proper hand placement â€“ factors that influence the effectiveness of CPR. Kiosk users can select to do the training in English or Spanish and the experience is closed captioned for accessibility.</p>
      <p>Hands-Only CPR has two simple steps, performed in this order: when you see a teen or adult suddenly collapse, call 911. Then, push hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute until help arrives. There are an additional 34 kiosks across the United States, 19 of which are located in U.S. airports. More than 115,000 people have been trained in the past year on the lifesaving skill of Hands-Only CPR across all kiosks.</p>
