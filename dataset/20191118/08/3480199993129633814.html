      <p>Two lanes were initially closed southbound leading to congestion, said Highways England officials.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Ambulance Service crews attended the scene shortly after 7am.</p>
      <p>Highways England officers temporarily blocked the motorway to clear the vehicles.</p>
      <p>They were moved to the hard shoulder by around 8am but congestion built-up behind.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if there are any injuries in the crash at this stage.</p>
