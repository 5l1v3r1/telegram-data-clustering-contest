      <h1>Agent discusses LFC target &amp; potential Fabinho backup Denis Zakaria’s future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:28:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Possible Liverpool target Denis Zakaria will not be leaving Borussia Monchengladbach this winter.</p>
      <p>That’s according to his agent, who ruled out a January transfer for his 22-year-old client who’s taken Germany by storm this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Denis will not leave Borussia in the winter, a change is 100 per cent excluded,” Mathieu Beda told <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/">Sport BILD, cited in the Mirror</a> – who list us one of a number of Premier Leagues to be interested in his services. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Denis is in very good shape in Gladbach and has been playing really well for weeks, but he still has more potential and he wants to show that in Gladbach now instead of dealing with a change.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gladbach sit on 25 points, four points ahead of Bayern and Rb Leipzig, and are now considered genuine title contenders.</p>
      <p>Zakaria has been their best player, providing ample steel and energy in holding midfield.</p>
      <p>He has plenty of <i>Fabinho</i> about him, but due to the Brazilian’s brilliance, would surely only come to Anfield as a backup option for our no.3 and not a replacement…</p>
      <p>We don’t have another high level holding midfielder – but Fabinho is nearly always fit and the fact Jordan Henderson, Gini Wijnaldum and even Marko Grujic next season can also fill this role make us doubt whether it’s a priority.</p>
      <p>Still, at 22, he fits the bill – a player at a non-elite club who is on an upward curve. The problem is when it comes to transfers, we’re very, very good already!</p>
