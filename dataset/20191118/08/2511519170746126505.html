      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> has shared photographs of her as a bridesmaid at her best friend’s wedding this weekend.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/a-star-is-born"><i>A</i> <i>Star is Born</i></a> actor posted several images to her Instagram Story from the wedding of her long-time makeup artist Sarah Tanno.</p>
      <p>In one of the photographs, Gaga could be seen posing in a floor-length satin pink gown, which matched her current bubblegum pink hair.</p>
      <p>Holding up a bouquet of flowers in celebration, Gaga wrote: “Two of my best friends just got married. Time to party!” </p>
      <p>The “Applause” singer also tagged Tanno, with whom she created her new beauty line <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/lady-gaga-beauty-brand-haus-laboratories-video-launch-fashion-a8998146.html">Haus Laboratories</a>, and the makeup artist’s now-husband Tim Stewart.</p>
      <p>In another image, Gaga posed with one of the other bridesmaids on the beach as they each put one leg up while holding their flowers. </p>
      <p>The 33-year-old also shared a photograph of the bride and groom, writing “Congratulations I love you” alongside a pink heart emoji.</p>

      <p>Last month, Gaga attended Tanno’s bachelorette party despite being “in a lot of pain,” as it came just one day after<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lady-gaga-stage-fall-vegas-enigma-fan-titanic-concert-a9160961.html"> the singer fell off stage during a performance</a> and landed on her back.</p>
      <p>“I might be in a lot of pain but I couldn’t miss my best friend’s bachelorette dinner,” Gaga wrote alongside a selfie from the night out.</p>

      <p>In the image, Gaga posed with a pair of pink “bridesmaid” glasses, which perfectly coordinated with her new hair colour.</p>

      <p>“A year ago, <i>A Star was Born</i>, and here we are six times pink platinum,” she wrote alongside a photograph of her holding the accolade.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time that the “Bad Romance” singer has switched up her platinum blonde locks. </p>
      <p>In January, the singer even coordinated her hair with the periwinkle ballgown she wore to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GoldenGlobes">Golden Globes</a>.</p>
