      <p>The Congress on Monday alleged that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/electoral-bonds">electoral bonds </a>became instruments of anonymous donations bordering on "opaque money laundering" and asked the Modi government to answer how many thousand crores were received by the ruling BJP through them.</p>
      <p>Congress' chief spokesperson <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/randeep-surjewala">Randeep Surjewala </a>cited a media report, which claimed that the government, in a bid to seek "secretive funds", "overruled" the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/reserve-bank-of-india">Reserve Bank of India </a>on the issue of introducing <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/electoral-bonds">electoral bonds.</a></p>
      <p>"RTI reveals how 'electoral bonds' became instruments of anonymous donations bordering on opaque 'money laundering'," Surjewala said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>"Will the Modi Govt answer -- 1. How many thousand crores of bonds issued? 2. How many thousand crores received by BJP? 3. The 'Quid Pro Quo'?" he asked.</p>
