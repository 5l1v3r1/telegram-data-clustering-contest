      <h1>Madness as Liverpool.com suggests Guardiola could be our next boss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:08:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>We’re honestly not sure where to begin with this one…</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpool.com/liverpool-fc-news/features/klopp-guardiola-pochettino-liverpool-job-17271721">Liverpool.com</a>, a good site that employs top quality journalists and has penned a number of interesting pieces in the past, has bizarrely named Pep Guardiola as a potential Jurgen Klopp replacement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dan Morgan claims Manchester City’s boss ‘can’t be discounted,’ and that ‘stranger things have happened,’ while suggesting Guardiola ‘fawning’ over Anfield’s atmosphere in various interviews is evidence he may jump at the chance should we make an approach… </b>
      </p>
      <p>For us, there’s being hypothetical and analytical – then just saying something outrageous may happen in five years’ time for the sake of it!</p>
      <p>Right now, Jurgen Klopp has two a half seasons to run on his current deal – which in football terms – is an absolute lifetime…</p>
      <p>The speculation about his potential successor is strange, considering the fact the German has actively said he’ll see out his deal [<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/07/18/jurgen-klopp-plays-need-new-liverpool-contract-no-need-do-now/">Telegraph</a>].</p>
      <p>But what really stops it from being something we can take seriously, is the hatred developing between City and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>It’s like suggesting Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson could swap roles in the <i>mid-noughties</i> during the height of <i>Arsenal v Manchester United.</i></p>
      <p>The bitterness developing between the two clubs starts at board level, as shown by us pushing for their FFP punishment and them complaining to the FA about the VAR decisions from our 3-1 win before the international break.</p>
      <p>It continues at team level, with Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez’s flare up just one of many examples.</p>
      <p>The fans actively despise each other and stand for different things – and Klopp and Guardiola are increasingly at each other in interviews, too.</p>
      <p>We’d go as far as to say that Guardiola is about the least likely manager to take Klopp’s position when he decides to step down as anybody else in Europe.</p>
