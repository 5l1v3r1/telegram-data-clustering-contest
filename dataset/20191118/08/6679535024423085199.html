      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:32:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Gautam-Sunder-74512/" target="_blank">Gautam Sunder</a></address>
      <p>A star-studded gathering at ‘Ungal Naan’, Kamal Haasan's celebration of 60 years in cinema with a concert by Ilaiyaraaja, led to some heartfelt tributes and some surprising revelations at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Kicking off with a montage by Kamal thanking 60 people critical to his success in the industry (including actors like Sivaji Ganesan, MGR, Rajinikanth, filmmakers Mani Ratnam, Balu Mahendra, producer AV Meiyappan, as well as the Haasan family), the event had Ilaiyaraja tease Kamal and make him run up to the stage a number of times, much to the audience’s delight.</p>

      <p>“It’s your event! How can you sit there and watch peacefully with the rest of the audience? Come up and sing, Kamal sir,” Raja grinned, as Kamal sang hits such as <i>Panneer Pushpangale </i>(the very first song the duo collaborated on) and <i>Sundari Neeyum</i>. However, it was his rousing (acoustic) rendition of <i>Thenpaandi Seemaiyile</i> from <i>Nayakan</i> that lifted the roof off the house.</p>
      <p>The guest list had many celebrities such as A.R. Rahman, Manisha Koirala, Ramesh Sippy, Tamannaah, Parthiban, Sarath Kumar, Ambika, Radha, Pa Ranjith, Mari Selvaraj, and so on present to witness the occasion.</p>

      <p>As the concert ended surprisingly quickly, it was time for the tributes to begin, and Karthi was the first one to take the stage thanking Kamal for paving the way for films without songs or heroines to be made(referring to his recent <i>Kaithi</i>) with the likes of <i>Kuruthipunal</i> in 1995.</p>
      <p>Jayam Ravi, Nasser, Pasupathi, Sathyaraj all followed suit sharing anecdotes of working with the star (Ravi was an AD on <i>Alavandhan</i>), but it was Vijay Sethupathi’s open request to Kamal that had the latter smiling the most. “I missed the chance to star in <i>Indian 2</i>. I learnt so much by acting with Superstar in <i>Petta</i>… I really wish I get the opportunity to work with you too on a film set; your process, your methodology, your routine: all this would be inspiring for actors like me.”</p>
      <p>Vadivelu, making a rare public appearance, stole the show, recalling an incident from his time working on Thevar Magan with Kamal and Sivaji Ganesan, where the latter chided him for overacting a scene to the hilt. The comedian’s impeccable sense of timing and expressions remain as fantastic as ever, and the <i>Nadigar Thilagam</i>’s son and grandson — Prabhu and Vikram Prabhu — were among many in the audience reduced to tears of laughter. A surprise was in store when it was revealed that Vadivelu would be starring in Kamal’s upcoming <i>Thalaivan Irukkindran</i> as well.</p>
      <p>Director Shankar, who is currently directing Kamal in <i>Indian 2</i> also spoke in length about how he is the ‘complete actor’ adding that his experience seeing him enact the character of ‘Senapathy’ was exhilarating. “Many say <i>Indian </i>is the best film I’ve ever made. In <i>Indian 2</i>, you will see many more surprises: one among which will be Kamal speaking in Gujarati, a feat for even a multi-linguist like him. He continues to astonish me by utilising every part of the acting process to the hilt: his body, dialogues, camera positions, knowing which supporting actors to choose and so on. The <i>kurinjipoo</i> blooms once in 12 years, the Athi Vardhar appears once in 40 years… a Kamal happens only every 60 years.”</p>
      <p>Kamal also acted out a scene from <i>Indian 2, </i>as well as dialogues from <i>Dasavatharam </i>and <i>Nayakan</i> after directors Shankar, KS Ravikumar and Mani Ratnam requested him to.</p>
      <p>There were performances from daughters Shruti and Akshara Haasan as tributes to their father, as well as by Andrea Jeremiah and Pooja Kumar, but the evening will be most remembered as a testament to one of the most memorable public showings of Kamal and Rajinikanth’s four-decade-old friendship.</p>

      <p>Reacting to director SAC’s earlier ‘wish’ from the evening on seeing him join hands politically, Rajinikanth said that wherever they both went in their respective careers — films or otherwise — their friendship would always withstand the test of time.</p>
      <p>“I came from a lower middle-class family and it was natural for me to struggle to make it to the top. But Kamal wasn’t like me, his family was educated, reputed and wealthy. Yet, this boy decided to work as a barber, as a dance assistant, and faced many more hardships — physical and mental — before becoming an actor.. Imagine how his family would have reacted. He’s worked harder than anyone to reach this stage.”</p>
      <p>“I still remember watching <i>Kalathur Kannamma </i>sitting on the mud in a touring talkies. I was a little child then, mesmerised by watching this other kid in the film, in total awe. Now, both the kid on the floor and the kid on screen have grown up! I have no qualms in admitting that I’ve always admired him and envied him even,” Rajini smiled.</p>
      <p>The<i> Darbar </i>star also added that though both of them had been asked to create an impression of ‘rivals’ so that their popularity and films would fare better, the actors never wanted to go down that route.</p>
      <p>“Don’t use our names to create fights. Let go of all the negative thoughts, and let there only be love all around.”</p>
      <p>Kamal echoed his friend’s thoughts: “We have persisted for 43 years together, only because of love. Don’t you think we will go longer?”</p>
