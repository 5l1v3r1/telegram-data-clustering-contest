      <h1>Chobani, others scramble to stop sliding US yogurt sales</h1>

      <p>U.S. yogurt sales are in a multiyear slump — and yogurt companies are scrambling to reverse the trend.</p>
      <p>Market research company Mintel says U.S. yogurt sales peaked at nearly $9 billion in 2015. They’re expected to fall to $8.2 billion this year and fall another 10% by 2024.</p>
      <p>Yogurt companies say new products can reverse the trend. On Monday, Chobani announced new oat-based yogurts. But it’s also hedging its bets and launching its first non-yogurt products. Chobani oat drinks and dairy creamers are due out in January.</p>
      <p>Mintel says yogurt is competing with other breakfast products, like protein bars and nutrition shakes.</p>
      <p>Yogurt makers need to attract new buyers and convince U.S. consumers to use yogurt beyond breakfast to see sales rise.</p>
