      <p>Australian actor Craig McLachlan indecently assaulted a female co-star during a scene in a stage musical in which he was meant to merely simulate a sex act, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Details of allegations brought by four women against the former star of long-running Australian soap operas Neighbours and Home And Away were aired in Melbourne Magistrates Court at a hearing expected to last three weeks.</p>
      <p>McLachlan, 54, is facing multiple charges, including counts of indecent assault, one of attempted indecent assault and others of assault, involving the four complainants who worked with him in a production of The Rocky Horror Show in 2014.</p>
      <p>He won Australian theatre’s prestigious Helpmann Award for best actor for the role.</p>
      <p>He denies the accusations by the four women.</p>
      <p>Prosecution lawyer Matt Fisher alleged McLachlan “went beyond the role he was directed to perform” in relation to the allegations.</p>
      <p>He said McLachlan assaulted one female co-star during the scene in which he was meant to be simulating a sex act, which took place out of sight of the audience.</p>
      <p>McLachlan kissed her more than 20 times and had once used his finger to trace the outline of the woman’s genitals, Mr Fisher told the court.</p>
      <p>“(The woman) felt as if she was trapped,” he said.</p>
      <p>McLachlan has also been accused of pushing his groin into the stomach area of another woman. He also kissed the woman during a show, without being directed to do so, forcing his tongue into her mouth.</p>
      <p>Mr Fisher told the court the woman had allegedly said to McLachlan: “Don’t you ever do that to me again.”</p>
      <p>McLachlan had allegedly replied: “Don’t you dare speak to me like that. You are nothing, I will end you.”</p>
      <p>McLachlan’s lawyer Stuart Littlemore will argue some of the alleged incidents did not occur, while others were not indecent.</p>
      <p>He said when McLachlan had given a woman an unexpected kiss on stage, he had the “licence and discretion to ad lib”.</p>
      <p>The four alleged victims will give evidence about the incidents in a closed court.</p>
      <p>After the women’s allegations were published, McLachlan initiated defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and a former co-star. That case has been delayed until after the criminal charges are resolved.</p>
