      <p>Critical Hit’s own awards show will be held in December, provided I can get permission from my dad to use his garage in which to host the event. I’m pretty certain I can fit a hundred people inside there and I’m sure they won’t mind having to sit on the floor next to the box of oily rags and old VW Beetle spare parts. Heck, even my catering is going to be good! I’ve got budget this year for <i>two </i>packets of Simba chips.</p>
