      <p>Gizri SHO Rizwan Haider told <i>Express News</i> that no legal action had been initiated since Shifa was believed to have died of natural causes.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest that there were no marks of injury on the body but the exact cause of death would only be determined after an autopsy.</p>
      <p>An assistant to MPA Mumtaz Chang told <i>The</i> <i>Express Tribune </i>that Shifa was a second-year student living in Karachi and that the cause of her death was cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>He said the body was being transported to Punjab for burial.</p>
      <p>Chang was elected to the Punjab Assembly after securing victory in PP-266 (Rahim Yar Khan-XII) on a PPP ticket.</p>
      <p>He polled 35,370 votes to defeat the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz’s Shaukat Daud (20,886 votes) and Muhammad Akmal of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (18,821 votes).</p>
