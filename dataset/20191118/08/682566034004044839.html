      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> head coach <b>Molefi Ntseki</b> applauded his side following a <b>1-0</b> victory over <b>Sudan</b> in a <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations</b> <b>(AFCON)</b> qualifier at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>South Africa scored on the stroke of half-time through eventual Man of the Match Leboang Phiri with an unstoppable strike with his weaker left foot.</p>
      <p>Ntseki said his players did what they needed to do to get the desired result and also get Bafana Bafana back on track in their qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>"It was a very difficult match," Ntseki said. "In terms of our traveling schedule which made this fixture difficult.</p>
      <p>"In terms of the game we wanted to start on the front foot but unfortunately we missed too many chances and we ended up becoming a bit anxious.</p>
      <p>"On the balance of play I think the players did very well in terms of how they expressed themselves within our tactical plan but I think we started the second-half a bit slow," he added.</p>
      <p>"The last 25 minutes of the second-half you could see that our legs were tiring a bit and that's why we tried to make more attacking substitutions which nearly came off.</p>
      <p>"The win is important for us as we're still fighting to qualify and hopefully everything will work out well for us."</p>
      <p>The 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign - set to be hosted by Cameroon - takes a nine-month break and will resume in September 2020.</p>
