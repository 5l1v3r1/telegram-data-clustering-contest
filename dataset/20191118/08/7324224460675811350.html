      <p>Two lanes were initially closed southbound leading to congestion, Highways England officials said.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Ambulance Service crews attended the scene shortly after 7am.</p>
      <p>The ambulance service said a van suffered rear end damage in a collision with another vehicle.</p>
      <p>Two people, including the male driver, were inside the van.</p>
      <p>The driver, aged in his 40s, was assessed by ambulance crews but did not require hospital treatment at that time.</p>
      <p>Highways England officers temporarily blocked the motorway to clear the vehicles.</p>
      <p>They were moved to the hard shoulder by around 8am but congestion built-up behind.</p>
      <p>It is unclear if there are any injuries in the crash at this stage.</p>
      <p>Congestion began to ease as the morning rush hour traffic subsided.</p>
