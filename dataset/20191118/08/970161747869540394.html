      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> may have got the Queen’s approval for his explosive Newsnight interview, Emily Maitlis has said.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York allegedly told the presenter he had to ‘seek approval from higher up’ before sitting down to talk about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Writing in <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/emily-maitlis-my-interview-with-prince-andrew-8hhclpwcf">The Times</a> today, Ms Maitlis stated that he then came back to the team at ‘8am the next day’ to say that the interview could go ahead.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘We have finished laying out our pitch. An awkward moment of silence falls. And the duke tells us he must “seek approval from higher up”.</p>
      <p>‘It dawns on us then that he means the Queen herself. At 8am the next day we have a message telling us to call his office. The Queen, it seems, is on board.’</p>

      <p>Ms Maitlis then later mused about the Queen’s apparent approval as she arrived at Buckingham Palace, where the interview took place.</p>

      <p>She questioned ‘the significance’ of the monarch lending ‘her own formal quarters’ for the filming, stating: ‘It feels like a code I do not properly understand.</p>
      <p>‘Is she endorsing her son? The need for this interview? Or am I reading way too much into every step, merely because there are so many of them?’</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis’ article comes just as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/17/queen-did-not-approve-prince-andrews-excruciating-newsnight/">The Telegraph</a> reported that the Duke of York had operated ‘in silo’ without the Queen’s approval.</p>
      <p>A source said Her Majesty was only made aware of the interview after it had already been set up.</p>
      <p>They continued: ‘The statement Buckingham Palace issued said the Queen was aware of the interview but not that she approved it.</p>

      <p>‘It does seem as if the Duke of York’s private office is operating in silo, which is really quite dangerous because there is a lack of accountability there. Internally, this is being seen as a f**k up.’</p>

      <p>According to Ms Maitlis, Newsnight approached Prince Andrew for an interview a year ago, but the Palace only returned their interest in May this year.</p>
      <p>However, they declined the offer ‘out of principle’ at first, after the duke’s team vetoed any conversation about Epstein.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until the sex offender and entrepreneur was found dead in his cell in August that talks of the interview resumed.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew was named in the legal deposition of Virginia Roberts, who claimed she was trafficked to him for sex at the age of 17.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis said of the accusations: ‘The Palace knew they had a problem. They had sent out statements vigorously denying the claims.</p>
      <p>‘But those perhaps lacked the conviction of a human voice behind them.’</p>

      <p>During the interview, broadcast on Saturday, the duke denied having sex with Ms Roberts, telling Ms Maitlis: ‘I have no recollection of meeting her.’</p>
      <p>He refuted her claims that he’d been ‘profusely sweating’ during their encounter, telling the presenter it was<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/"> ‘almost impossible’ for him to perspire due to a medical condition</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The duke said: ‘I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.</p>
      <p>‘…I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply… it was almost impossible for me to sweat.’</p>
      <p>He also said he had been at ‘Pizza Express in Woking’ on March 10 2001 – the date the allegations were said to have taken place.</p>
