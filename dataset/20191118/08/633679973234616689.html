      <p>E-Hailing drivers in Port Elizabeth have embarked on a city-wide parade and awareness drive to shine the spotlight on their safety concerns following a rise in robbery and hijacking incidents in the past week.</p>
      <p>The drivers from Uber, Bolt and inDrive say they no longer feel safe to operate as they are being targeted by criminals.</p>
      <p>The Parade's co-ordinator, Arnold Bezuidenhout says there have been several hijackings of eHailing Drivers reported to the police in the past week.</p>
      <p>He says one hijacking is one too many and it cannot be business as usual while they suffer at the hands of criminals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, police Spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge says increased police visibility in areas where eHailing Services operate could help eliminate the incidents.</p>
      <p>He urged drivers to go to SAPS and share their busiest routes with them in order to get police cars patrolling the area.</p>
