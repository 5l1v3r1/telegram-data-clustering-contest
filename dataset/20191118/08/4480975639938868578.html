      <p>Gold edged lower through the early European session on Monday and is currently placed at multi-day lows, around the $1460 region.<br/> <br/>The precious metal extended last week's late pullback from the $1474-75 supply zone and witnessed some follow-through selling at the start of a new trading week. The incoming positive trade-related headlines continued denting demand for traditional safe-haven assets and turned out to be one of the key factors weighing on <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a>.</p>
      <h3>Weighed down by fading safe-haven demand</h3>
      <p>In the latest development, Chinese state media Xinhua reported over the weekend that the two countries had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday. This comes on the back of the recent comments by US officials that they were close to securing a trade deal with China and further fueled the recent trade optimism.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, the latest leg of a drop over the past hour or so could further be attributed to a sudden pickup in the US Treasury bond yields, which tend to drive flows away from the non-yielding yellow metal. However, a subdued US Dollar demand might extend some support to the dollar-denominated commodity and help limit the downside.<br/> <br/>There aren't any major market-moving economic releases due on Monday and hence, the key focus will remain on the incoming trade headlines. This coupled with the USD price dynamics and the broader market risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> might further contribute towards producing some short-term trading opportunities.</p>
