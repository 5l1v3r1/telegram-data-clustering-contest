      <h1>Police fighting to seize £14,000 from Meadow Well man who built an illegal club in his back garden</h1>
      <h2>The club had everything from fruit machines to pool tables - but Northumbria Police say it had a more sinister purpose</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Johnson</a></address>
      <p>A crook who built a social club in his back garden could lose over £14,000 in what police claim is dirty cash.</p>
      <p>James Blake's makeshift watering hole stocked alcohol and had a pool table and TV - while he even laid on crisps for punters to enjoy.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police</a> raided the club in 2017, seizing fruit machines as it shut the illegal venue down.</p>
      <p>The club was later exposed as a front for money laundering, with Blake admitting a string of offences.</p>
      <p>Back in April, he pleaded guilty to three counts of transferring criminal property, one count of possession of criminal property and one count of abstracting electricity at his home address.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old is currently awaiting his fate with a Newcastle Crown Court judge set to sentence him early next year.</p>
      <p>However, Northumbria Police is currently fighting a different court case to lay claim to almost £14,500 in cash they claim Blake laundered.</p>
      <p>The force made an application at Newcastle Magistrates' Court on Friday for the continued detention of the cash, which they seized as part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>In total, £13,529 along with 1,100 Euros was seized.</p>
      <p>That case - which has been adjourned almost a dozen times - was put off again until January 31.</p>
      <p>That will be a week after the Wantage Avenue defendant is sentenced at the Crown Court on January 24.</p>
