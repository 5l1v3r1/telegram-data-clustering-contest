      <p>A dazzling slimmer is getting ready to shine this Christmas party season after achieving an amazing five stone weight-loss.</p>
      <p>Linzi Gustinelli, who has lost five stone, was nominated as the Hamilton South Church Slimming World group’s Miss Slinky 2019, after fellow members were wowed by her achievement.</p>
      <p>Slimming World’s annual Miss Slinky competition recognises those members who have transformed both inside and out by becoming healthier and happier, slimmer and more confident, and who look great in their Christmas party clothes.</p>
      <p>Linzi, 29, who has dropped from a dress size 18 to a size 10, said: “I was already really looking forward to this Christmas and feeling confident enough to wear outfits that I couldn’t or wouldn’t have last year. I am even more excited to be using my success to shape a whole new career helping other people change their lives and achieve their weight loss dreams too.”</p>

      <p>Now she has trained as a consultant for Slimming World, the UK’s largest group-based weight loss organisation, at their national academy in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Members at the Hillhouse group welcomed Linzi as their new consultant when she took over the group earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Linzi began following Slimming World’s Food Optimising healthy eating plan, which encourages members to satisfy their appetite on healthy foods like pasta, rice, potatoes, lean meat, fish, fruit and veg and more. Slimmers are able to lose weight without ever going hungry and still enjoy treats without feeling deprived, so there’s no need to miss out on their festive favourites this Christmas.</p>

      <p>She said: “Like a lot of slimmers, I had tried to lose weight so many times before by following numerous diets but they were never sustainable because I’d always get tired of restricting what I ate. I thought I was destined to struggle with my weight for the rest of my life, but when I came to Slimming World it was different. I never felt like I was on a diet. The eating plan encourages you to eat lots of tasty, filling foods like pasta, rice, potatoes and lean meat and fish. You are never hungry and no foods are banned, so there’s no deprivation. I couldn’t believe I’d found a way to lose weight without starving myself.</p>
      <p>“I’d love to inspire other people to lose weight too and show that whether you’ve got a little or a lot of weight to lose, slimming down can make a big difference to how you feel about yourself and really boost your confidence.”</p>
      <p>Linzi’s Slimming World group will be held at Hillhouse Parish Church Hall every Monday at 5.30pm.</p>
