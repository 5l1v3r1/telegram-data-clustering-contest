      <p>Regional Education Officer, Joyce Baravuga, disclosed the center will be constructed at Msamvu B Primary School.</p>
      <p>She noted the decision is in line with the five years’ strategic plans Morogoro had set to promote its tourist sites.<br/>"The Regional Education Office decided to use undeveloped 10 acres that Msamvu B Primary School owns, this will also help us curb crime at the school,” she noted.</p>
      <p>A total of 23 computer sets worth 12m/- owned by the school were recently stolen by thieves, who are said to lurk around the woods located on the school’s plot.</p>
      <p>“The school experiences insecurity, robbers are hiding in the woods at the plot.”</p>
      <p>Joyce pointed out the center will after completion facilitate availability of details on attractions available at Selous, Mikumi and Ruaha national parks.</p>
      <p>She said according to National Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policy, electronic services can be put to use to facilitate provision of social and economic services such as tourism, education and others.</p>
      <p>"Availability of e-content in ICT products and services is important in order to meet national development goals,” she added.</p>
      <p>Msamvu B Primary School‘s head, Elidad Matthew Ikomba, promised the school’s pupils will be exposed to knowledge on tourist attractions in a bid to improve the pupils’ skills in various subjects through e-content materials.</p>
      <p>"It is my hope the pupils will be ambassadors for the region’s tourist attractions particularly Selous and Mikumi national parks,” Ikomba noted.</p>
      <p>“Besides, after completion of Standard Seven, it will be easy for them to easily develop technical skills at a secondary school, which will soon be constructed here."</p>
      <p>Ikomba pointed out construction of buildings at the undeveloped acres will hopefully significantly improve security of the school's properties.</p>
      <p>Ikomba said the theft of the computer sets happened due to inadequate security at the school.</p>
