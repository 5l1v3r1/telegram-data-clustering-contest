      <p>KOTA KINABALU, Nov 18 — Sabah Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Christina Liew today announced that the state is looking to get into the medical tourism sector by signing an agreement with a London-based firm in the near future.</p>
      <p>Liew said she has met with the firm — a global specialist company in medical tourism during the ‘World Travel Mart’ event held in London earlier this month. </p>
      <p>“They had visited Sabah six months ago and did a market survey. They are very keen on Sabah,” she said when speaking to reporters at the State Assembly building here.</p>
      <p>Liew said Sabah had a lot to catch up as other states in Peninsular Malaysia has gained a reputation for their medical tourism.</p>
      <p>“I had a look at the numbers and it is impressive. It’s a multi-million ringgit industry and I think Sabah would excel in this. We have a number of private hospitals with qualified cosmetic surgeons. We have many resorts and hotels where patients stay and recover.</p>
      <p>“Sabah doesn’t just have good medical facilities but also beautiful tourism spots,” she said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Liew was answering questions posed by opposition Kiulu Assemblyman Joniston Bangkuai during the question and answer session on what the state can expect from the Visit Malaysia Year 2020. </p>
      <p>She said Sabah had actively promoted tourism abroad and is expected to have an additional one million tourists next year in conjunction with the Visit Malaysia Year 2020.</p>
      <p>She also said efforts are underway to attract more Europeans, Indian nationals and Middle Eastern tourists as part of its diversifying efforts.</p>
      <p>“Connectivity is the problem right now so we are working to get chartered flights in,” she said.</p>
