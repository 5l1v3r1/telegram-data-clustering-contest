      <p>BEIJING — Foreign direct investment (FDI) in China rose 6.6% from a year earlier to 752.41 billion yuan ($107.58 billion) in the first 10 months of the year, the commerce ministry said on Monday.</p>
      <p>In October, FDI to China grew 7.4% from a year earlier to 69.2 billion yuan, the ministry said.</p>
      <p>Foreign investment is expected to remain stable over the full year, said Zong Changqing, director of the department for foreign investment under the Ministry of Commerce, at a news briefing in Beijing on Monday.</p>
      <p>Overall, China has not seen a large-scale retreat of foreign investment, said Zong, when asked about companies moving production to other countries to avoid higher pressure brought about by tariffs.</p>
      <p>China and the United States remain locked in a bruising trade war involving tariff hikes on billions of dollars worth of each other’s goods. ($1 = 6.9941 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Lusha Zhang and Se Young Lee; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Alex Richardson)</p>
