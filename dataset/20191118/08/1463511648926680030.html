      <h1>Brazil lifts fourth U-17 World Cup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:01:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Host Brazil have won their fourth crown of the Under 17 FIFA World Cup, following a 2-1 win over Mexico in the final at Brasilia’s Estadio Bezerrao.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians have now moved within one title of equalling record holders, Nigeria, though this was their first since 2003.</p>
      <p>It also may have been the sweetest, given that the South Americans became only the second team to top the competition as hosts – the first, interestingly enough, was Mexico eight years ago.</p>
      <p>For the second straight match, Lazaro was Brazil’s super sub.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, he capped his side’s comeback against France in the semi-final by bagging the winning goal in the 89th minute.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the No 20 left it even later.</p>
      <p>Brazil fell behind in the 66th minute when Bryan Gonzalez beat adidas Golden Glove winner Matheus Donelli with a superbly-directed header.</p>
      <p>A Kaio Jorge penalty goal brought Brazil roaring back 18 minutes later, and Lazaro’s volleyed, close-range strike three minutes into second-half stoppage time sealed the trophy for the hosts.</p>
      <p>In the third-place match, France rode Arnaud Kalimuendo-Muinga’s hat-trick to victory over European rivals, Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Both teams benefitted from the reintroduction of their captains, who missed their respective semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Oranje field general Kenneth Taylor assisted the opening goal of the match, flicking a pass over the French defence to play Mohamed Taabouni in on goal.</p>
      <p>France captain Lucien Agoume countered with an incisive through ball seven minutes later, which eventually led to Kalimuendo-Muinga’s first goal.</p>
      <p>The Paris Saint-Germain starlet scored two more in the second period en route to Les Bleuets’ bronze medal finish.</p>
