      <p>Microsoft has announced that they will no longer support the Cortana digital personal assistant app on Android and iOS devices starting in 2020.</p>
      <p>In support articles for the UK, Australian, and Canadian markets, Microsoft has stated that they will no longer support the Cortana digital assistant apps on iOS and Android stating on January 31st, 2020. Instead, Microsoft will be integrating Cortana into the Microsoft 365 productivity apps.</p>
      <p>At that time, any Cortana content that was created, such as reminders and lists will no longer work in the app, but will continue to be available in Cortana on Windows. </p>
      <p>Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4531683">states</a> that any lists and tasks will automatically be synchronized with the Microsoft To Do app as well if installed.</p>
      <p>"To make your personal digital assistant as helpful as possible, we’re integrating Cortana into your Microsoft 365 productivity apps. As part of this evolution, on January 31st, 2020, we’re ending support for the Cortana app on Android and iOS in your market. At that point, the Cortana content you created–such as reminders and lists–will no longer function in the Cortana mobile app or Microsoft Launcher, but can still be accessed through Cortana on Windows. Also, Cortana reminders, lists, and tasks are automatically synced to the Microsoft To Do app, which you can download to your phone for free."</p>
      <p>When support for the Cortana apps ends, Microsoft will also release a new Microsoft Launcher app with Cortana removed.</p>
      <p>It is not known at this time if this change is affecting all markets or only UK, Australia, and Canada.</p>
      <p>BleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft regarding other markets that may be affected and will update the story if we hear back.</p>
