      <h1>Galaxy Note 9 and Galaxy S9 Android 10 beta coming soon!</h1>

      <p>Good news <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/devices/galaxy-note-9/">Galaxy Note 9</a> and <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/devices/galaxy-s9/">Galaxy S9</a> owners: Samsung will soon be starting the Android 10 and One UI 2.0 beta program for its 2018 flagships. The company’s ‘beta operations manager’ on the Samsung Korea community website <a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8-9-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80-%EC%9D%B4%EB%B2%88%EC%A3%BC-%EC%A4%91-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91-%EB%90%A0-%EC%98%88%EC%A0%95/td-p/2750398">confirmed</a> to a user that the Galaxy Note 9 beta program will kick off sometime later this week while the Galaxy S9 beta will arrive next week.</p>
      <p>We had <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/which-galaxy-phones-will-get-an-android-10-beta-program/">deduced a long time back</a> that the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 9 will be a part of Samsung’s One UI 2.0 beta tests, and the company <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-starts-testing-android-10-for-the-galaxy-note-9/">has been testing Android 10</a> for both devices internally <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-already-testing-the-galaxy-s9-with-android-10/">for a couple of months</a>. The fact that Samsung is already prepared to let users test Android 10 on their Galaxy S9/S9+/Note 9 is <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/google-samsung-will-release-stable-android-10-update-by-end-of-year/">another sign</a> that it is moving extremely fast with the Android 10 update for its devices. Samsung has even <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-starts-android-10-development-for-the-galaxy-m20-and-m30/">started testing Android 10 for its budget devices</a>, and it could release the stable update for at least the Galaxy S10 soon as it will stop <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-android-10-release-one-ui-2-0-beta-closed-korea/">taking registrations for the Galaxy S10 beta program this week</a>.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 9 Android 10 beta program will start in Korea first and will gradually expand to other markets, but no concrete dates are known. It also remains to be seen which countries will get the beta update for the Galaxy S9 and Note 9. You can rest assured that we’ll let you know as soon as we have any information on the matter, and in the meantime, you can check out the video below to see some of the features that you will be getting on your S9/Note 9 with the Android 10 and One UI 2.0.</p>
