          <b>Prison Officer In Adultery Storm With Married Woman</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>A Prison Officer based at Harare Civil Court is in the soup for allegedly preying on women who visit the courts. The nasty revelations came to light after Nicodimus Chigando, who is married to Tilder Kunaka confronted Francis Jowakem over his alleged affair with his wife.</p>
      <p>H-Metro reports that there was fracas after Chigando stormed at the Harare Civil Court baying for Jowakem’s blood for allegedly having an affair with his wife. Chigando made sensational allegations that Jowakem had seduced his wife when she approached the court seeking custody for their child after their marriage had broken down temporarily. Chigando demanded to see Jowakem’s superiors citing that his conduct was not professional and deserved a stiff penalty. Chigando reported to senior prison officers that Jowakem was dating his wife.</p>

      <p>Chigando told the publication that the love-affair confirmed Jowakem’s abuse of office.</p>
      <aside>Jowakem seduced my wife a month ago when she came here seeking custody of our month-old child whom she left at our matrimonial home following a misunderstanding.<br/>He pretended to be a Good Samaritan assisting my wife to get to the relevant offices, while he had an agenda to have a love affair with her.<br/>My wife failed to resist, and the two started dating. I only discovered it when I checked her mobile phone.<br/>I wanted him fired for failing to be professional. That is why I decided to take my issue to his bosses.<br/>He apologised and begged me for forgiveness, but it does not help since he has already won my wife’s heart by taking advantage of our differences.</aside>
      <p>Jowakem could neither confirm nor deny dating Kunaka, referring the questions to Chigando.</p>
      <aside>I have no comment my brother over this. I cannot say we have resolved the issue, and Chigando is the best person to say much about it.</aside>
      <p>Kunaka could not be reached for comment.</p>
