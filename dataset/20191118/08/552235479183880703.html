      <h1>Truck ram terror at motorway junction near Strathclyde Park</h1>
      <h2>The court heard a man leapt out of the Ford Transit truck and used a scythe to smash her windows.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hamilton Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/hamilton-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A woman wept as she described her terror when a pick-up truck deliberately rammed her vehicle at a busy motorway junction near Strathclyde Park.</p>
      <p>Theresa Townsley said a man leapt out of the Ford Transit truck and used a scythe to smash her windows.</p>
      <p>She claimed the attack happened after she and her sister had fled from a car park where her husband was brutally assaulted over an alleged £13,000 debt.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old mother told a jury at Hamilton Sheriff Court she thought she was going to die when the violence erupted.</p>
      <p>Alexander Burke, 28, was jailed for three years after being found guilty of assaulting James Wilson to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement.</p>
      <p>He was also convicted of assaulting Ms Townsley and her sister Mary Jean Townsley as they cowered in their vehicle.</p>
      <p>His dad, also Alexander, 48, was found guilty of the attack on the sisters, but cleared of assaulting Mr Wilson. He was jailed for two years.</p>
      <p>A third man, James Johnstone, 23, walked free when he was acquitted of assaulting Mr Wilson and battering a car with a hammer.</p>
      <p>All those involved in the case were said to be members of the travelling community.</p>
      <p>The accused live in the Aberdeen area.</p>
      <p>James Wilson was allegedly owed £13,000 for one of the pick-ups he had sold to Alexander Burke senior.</p>
      <p>The court heard that a meeting to sort out the payment had been arranged for a car park near M&amp;D’s Theme Park on May 26.</p>
      <p>But Mr Wilson claimed that eight or nine men arrived in two pick-ups and Burke senior got out of one of the vehicles and threatened to kill him.</p>
      <p>Then, he alleged, Burke junior battered him over the head with a spade.</p>
      <p>Medical evidence agreed by all sides stated that Mr Wilson suffered a serious wound which would have required 40-50 conventional stitches but was instead treated with continuous stitching.</p>
      <p>Describing the background to the meeting, Ms Townsley alleged Burke senior had stolen the pick-up from her husband, Mr Wilson.</p>
      <p>This had been reported to the police who were actively looking for the truck.</p>
      <p>The witness agreed with Neil Thomson, prosecuting, that the park meeting had been arranged to “finalise payment”.</p>
      <p>Ms Townsley said what happened instead was a running battle.</p>
      <p>She claimed Burke senior had emerged from a pick-up, pointed at James Wilson and said ‘You’re dead, you’re dead’.</p>
      <p>Then, she alleged, Burke junior punched her husband several times.</p>
      <p>She and her sister Mary Jean panicked and fled in Mary Jean’s minibus, but they found themselves sandwiched between the pick-ups as they made their way to the Raith interchange.</p>
      <p>Ms Townsley sobbed as she said: “Sandy Burke senior was driving one of them. I didn’t see who was driving the other.</p>
      <p>“Both pick-ups just kept ramming us. I couldn’t count how many times it happened.</p>
      <p>“We were stopped on the Raith interchange roundabout when Burke junior jumped out of one of the pick-ups.</p>
      <p>“It was rush hour and there was a lot of traffic.</p>
      <p>“He put a scythe through the passenger side window and tried to cut me.</p>
      <p>“He was saying ‘You’re dead, you’re dead’.</p>
      <p>“We thought we were going to die.</p>
      <p>“Burke junior smashed the rest of the windows then ran back to the pick-up.</p>
      <p>“We managed to get back to Strathclyde Park, where I phoned the police.”</p>
      <p>The accused did not give evidence, but defence lawyers urged the jury to reject the Crown version of events.</p>
      <p>They suggested James Wilson was a man of violence, pointing to three weapons – a knuckleduster, a sharpened metal pole and a wrench – found in his Cherokee Jeep as proof.</p>
      <p>Sandy Morrison, representing Burke senior, said Theresa Townsley’s evidence about her sister’s vehicle being rammed repeatedly was “incredible”.</p>
      <p>He asked the jury: “Where are the other drivers to give independent evidence? Where is the dash cam footage? There is none.”</p>
      <p>Andy Thomson, Burke junior’s lawyer, also suggested the story about the rush hour ramming had been made up.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is astonishing that an incident like this happens on that busy interchange at 6.30pm and no one else stops or phones the police. That makes no sense.”</p>
