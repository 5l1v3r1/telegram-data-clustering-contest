      <p>As a result, majority of the citizenry especially the youths have devised ways and means to get financial freedom with money rituals being part of the short cuts to financial freedom.

      <p>But according to Nana Agradaa, irrespective of the deplorable financial status of a person, whoever is below Ghana’s voting age is not required to come to her shrine for financial assistance. To the best knowledge of the powerful traditional priestess, under 18 people don’t need a whopping amount of money for anything.</p>
