      <h2>US man is suspected of membership of Atomwaffen Division, a violent far-right group</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:09:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/conor-gallagher-7.4048148" target="_blank">Conor Gallagher</a></address>
      <p>An alleged supporter of a neo-Nazi terrorist group was deported to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> by police in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Berlin">Berlin</a> earlier this month, having tried to gain entry to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Germany">Germany</a>.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old man, identified in German media as “Kyle M”, is suspected to be a member of the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Atomwaffen">Atomwaffen</a> (Atomic Weapons) Division, a violent far-right group which was been implicated in several murders and planned terrorist attacks in the US.</p>
      <p>The man, who is from the US, flew from Dublin to Berlin on November 7th before being sent back to Dublin by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=German+Federal+Police">German Federal Police</a> later that day.</p>
      <p>It is not known if he was travelling from the US to Germany via a connecting flight through Dublin or if he had been living in Ireland.</p>
      <p>His current whereabouts are also unknown. The Garda has yet to respond to queries on whether he was deported to the US or if he is still in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Despite its small size - it is estimated to have less than 100 members in the US - the Atomwaffen Division is one of the most violent neo-Nazi groups to spring up in recent years.</p>
      <p>It was founded in the southern states of the US in about 2015 and has branches or associate organisations in the UK, Canada, Germany and several eastern European states.</p>
      <p>Its members have been implicated in murder, gun smuggling and planning attacks on US nuclear facilities.</p>
      <h3>Death threats</h3>
      <p>In recent months it has also become increasingly active in Germany where in October supporters issued death threats to two Green Party politicians, drawing condemnation from German Chancellor <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Angela+Merkel">Angela Merkel</a>.</p>
      <p>According to reports in Der Speigel and Die Zeit, German police were tipped off by the FBI that Kyle M was travelling to Berlin via Dublin.</p>
      <p>He arrived on an <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Aer+Lingus">Aer Lingus</a> flight at Tegel Airport on the evening of Thursday, November 7th. Federal Police detained he as he came off the plane and held him for questioning before putting him on a flight back to Dublin that night.</p>
      <p>The man told the authorities he was in Germany for a holiday and to marry a German woman, police said.</p>
      <p>German Federal Police did not return a request for more details on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Citing social media posts, Die Zeit newspaper reported Kyle M has connections to the German far-right through the neo-nazi music scene.</p>
      <p>In 2018, right-wing extremists announced the establishment of a German branch of the Atomwaffen Division. Shortly afterwards, German police warned a US woman that she was under threat from members of the group who they believed had travelled from the US to attack her.</p>
