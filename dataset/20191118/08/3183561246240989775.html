      <p>This summer, Marvel Studios <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/07/everything-we-learned-from-marvels-hall-h-panel">announced titles for all its movies</a> coming out through 2021. A few months later, we found out <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/black-panther-2s-release-date-revealed-kit-harington-joins-the-eternals-and-more-marvel-movie-news-from-d23">what movie was coming out</a> in May 2022. At that point, the last movie on the studio’s schedule was slated for July of that year. Now, it goes much further than that.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-sets-2021-release-ridley-scotts-last-duel-pushes-back-kings-man-7-months-1255349">Disney just announced</a> a ton of new release dates, almost all of which are just placeholder “Untitled” films. Most are labelled as Fox movies. But scattered in the huge list are five new Marvel Studios movies: one more in 2022, and then four in 2023.</p>
      <p>So, yeah, those Marvel Studios movies aren’t stopping anytime soon.</p>

      <p>Here’s the full list of what’s coming to theatres (<a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/you-cant-watch-any-of-the-new-marvel-shows-today-but-heres-some-concept-art">read more about the Disney+ stuff here</a>) from Marvel Studios, for 2020 and beyond:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>May 1, 2020: <i>Black Widow</i></li>
        <li>November 6, 2020: <i>The Eternals</i></li>
        <li>February 12, 2021: <i>Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</i></li>
        <li>May 7, 2021: <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i></li>
        <li>November 5, 2021: <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i></li>
        <li>February 18, 2022: Untitled</li>
        <li>May 5, 2022: <i>Black Panther 2</i></li>
        <li>July 29, 2022: Untitled</li>
        <li>Oct. 7, 2022: Untitled</li>

        <li>Nov. 3, 2023: Untitled</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Those last five are the new ones, and they could be anything, from titles we already know are in the works—like <i>Guardians of the Galaxy 3, Captain Marvel 3, Ant-Man 3,</i> or<i> Blade—</i>to maybe even some Fox stuff, like<i> X-Men, Fantastic Four</i>, or<i> Deadpool</i>. And no, you aren’t going crazy; as of now, we’re getting four Marvel Studios movies in 2022 and four more in 2023. That’s on top of all the Disney+ stuff coming a little before that. Marvel Studios isn’t going anywhere—in fact, it’s busier than ever.</p>
