      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | The defender is walking a disciplinary tightrope with games against Newcastle, Man United and Chelsea on the horizon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:35:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> striker Darren Bent has told Dean Smith he needs to have 'a quiet word with Frederic Guilbert ahead of a potential, costly suspension.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has been in fine form since his introduction into the Villa squad in the summer. But against Wolves, he amassed his fourth booking of the season, meaning he now walks a disciplinary tightrope.</p>

      <p>The cut-off for a ban for yellow card accumulation is still a number of weeks away, meaning that he could miss a game in a tough looking run of fixtures.</p>
      <p>Villa host Newcastle next, before games against top four hopefuls Chelsea, Man United and Leicester City.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And Bent believes Smith needs to tell Guilbert, who has picked up 25 cautions since the start of the 2017/18 season, to 'ease off the gas'.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-bent-hopes-smith-has-quiet-word-with-aston-villa-player-ahead-of-newcastle-clash/">Football Insider:</a> “I’m not sure he will (be sweating) just because when Dean Smith signed him, he knew about this record so it obviously doesn’t bother him that much but you’d like to think that Smith has had a quiet word with him and say ‘listen, take your foot off the gas a little bit as we can’t afford to lose you for games’.</p>
      <p>“But at the same time, he can’t really have any complaints as he knew the record when he signed him.”</p>
