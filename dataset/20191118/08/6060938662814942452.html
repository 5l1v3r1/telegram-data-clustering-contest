      <h1>Hockey: India men begin Olympic preps with national camp in Bhubaneswar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:12:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:12</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>BHUBANESWAR: With no immediate assignment lining up till next year, the Indian men's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hockey">hockey</a> side will focus on individual improvement rather than team tactics during the national camp that began here on Monday, chief coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Graham-Reid">Graham Reid</a> said.</p>
      <p>After securing a 2020 Olympics berth by beating Russia in the qualifiers, the team is currently undergoing a three-week training and conditioning camp that will conclude on December 8.</p>
      <p>"Given there is no tournament immediately following the three-week camp in Bhubaneswar, it is a perfect opportunity for us to change focus from team tactics to more about individual improvement," Reid said as the national camp of 33 core probables began at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kalinga-Stadium">Kalinga Stadium</a> in Odisha capital.</p>
      <p>"We will do this through detailed analysis and review from our performances last season, including the FIH Olympic Qualifiers in Odisha. This will provide a good road-map for us in our quest to squeeze as much improvement as we can in the next nine months," the 53-year-old Australian added.</p>
      <p>The Indian team recently secured its place at the 2020 Olympic Games by defeating Russia 11-3 on aggregate in the Olympic qualifiers.</p>
      <p>India's next assignment will be the twin home-leg matches of the FIH Pro League against the Netherlands in January next year.</p>
