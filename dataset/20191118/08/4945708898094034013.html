      <p>Japan's Softbank said Monday it will merge its Z Holdings unit—formerly called Yahoo Japan—with popular chat app Line in a multibillion-dollar deal it hopes will help it better compete against big guns in the digital services sector such as Amazon.</p>
      <p>The tie-up will create a tech giant worth $30 billion, with Softbank and South Korea's Naver Corp, which owns a majority stake in Line, to offer shareholders 5,200 yen a share.</p>
      <p>Once the deal expected in October next year is agreed, the new company will delist with each side holding a 50 percent stake.</p>
      <p>SoftBank holds about 44 percent of Z Holdings while Naver owns 73 percent of Line. The two expect to spend 170 billion yen ($1.56 billion) each on the bid.</p>
      <p>"(Yahoo Japan) was a rival firm with a similar vision. But today we made a very big decision to take each other's hands," LINE chief executive Takeshi Idezawa told reporters at a joint press conference.</p>
      <p>"The word 'one team' trended after the Rugby World Cup in Japan. We'll also aim to make the strongest one team," Z Holdings CEO Kentaro Kawabe said.</p>
      <p>The company heads said they decided to merge because they shared the same "sense of crisis".</p>
      <p>"The IT industry has a structure of 'winner takes all'... we're much smaller even as a merged company in every aspect such as operating profit and R&amp;D compared to US firms," Idezawa said.</p>
      <p>Kawabe described how the merger could help with some of the issues facing Japan, such as labour shortages and natural disasters.</p>
      <p>"The population in Japan will decline... and productivity will drop, which can be solved with IT. We can also save more lives in case of disaster," he said.</p>
      <p>Line was launched in 2011 after Japan's massive quake-tsunami damaged telecoms infrastructure.</p>
      <p>It combines features from Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp with games and a mobile-payment service.</p>
      <p>SoftBank and Line have increasingly competed in fields such as digital payments, while both firms have also been investing in AI to improve their services.</p>
      <p>Shares in Line ended up more than two percent in Tokyo on Monday, while Z Holdings rose more than one percent.</p>
