      <p>Ever since Robbo’s (Jake Ryan) life became endangered, placing those around him in danger too, we haven’t heard much from a heavily pregnant Tori (Penny McNamee) as she has been placed under AFP protection in a remote safe house.</p>
      <p>With Jasmine (Sam Frost) now returned to the house due to Robbo being missing, Tori has more company than an AFP officer. However, her worries for Robbo have risen along with Jasmine’s.</p>
      <p>Jasmine stresses out over Robbo not having returned her calls all week, and worries that something bad has happened. Although Scott (Trent Baines) and Tori try to reassure her otherwise, Jasmine struggles to believe that a week of no contact is simply Robbo tying up loose ends.</p>
      <p>However, her worries are suddenly swept to one side when Tori’s water breaks and she goes into labour. Tori becomes panicked, as due to her remote location and her suture, she could easily have complications.</p>

      <p>Scott goes to call Robbo and a doctor, and it isn’t long before medical assistance arrives to remove the suture and help with the delivery.</p>

      <p>Jasmine asks Scott if he got through to Robbo, but he simply says he left a message for Lance (Angus McLaren), causing Jasmine to become even more convinced that something has happened to her husband.</p>
      <p>Tori’s labour quickly develops, and the doctor tells her that it will soon be time to push. Tori worries that she can’t do it without Robbo, and Jasmine has to put her fears for Robbo aside again to focus on reassuring Tori.</p>
      <p>Scott then manages to slip away and call Robbo, telling him that Tori is about to give birth – and he needs to get there ASAP…</p>
