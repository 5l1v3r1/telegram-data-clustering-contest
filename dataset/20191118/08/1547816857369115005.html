        <b>The first strong connection that we saw develop in the Bigg Boss 13 house was between Paras Chhabra and Shehnaaz Gill. In fact, the latter had even professed her love to Paras. Now, as we spoke to Shehnaaz's father Santok Singh Sukh, he spilled the beans on how his daughter actually fell for Paras and it wasn't a game strategy</b>
      </p>
      <p>In each season of Bigg Boss, we see some new connections forge that either last only till the show, or last till forever. In the 13th season of the reality show, the first connection that we saw form in the house was between Shehnaaz Gill and Paras Chhabra.</p>
      <p>They instantly built an equation and we also saw Shehnaaz professing her love for Paras. Obviously their romantic camaraderie left the audience wondering as to how is it possible to fall in love so quickly? Many called it a game strategy, but Shehnaaz’s father Santok Singh Sukh begs to differ and states that his daughter genuinely liked Paras.</p>

      <p>We interacted with Shehnaaz’s father at length and when we quizzed him on his daughter’s alleged love story in the house with Paras Chhabra (who’s already dating Akanksha Puri outside), he said, "In the first episode, Salman Sir had informed the contestants that they have to make connections inside. So somewhere, it got stuck in my daughter’s head that she has to build a strong connection inside. She went for Paras amongst the rest because she knew about him as she had seen him on Splitsvilla. However, with time, I realised that she actually started developing feelings for him and woh dil se chahne lagi thi usko. However, Paras always wanted to be with Mahira and he used Shehnaaz for it. In the first week, we saw him and Shehnaaz sitting on the red sofa. But when Paras saw that she is getting serious for him, he clarified it to her that he is already committed to someone. And I really liked that about him. Though the makers didn't air this conversation of them on TV, in one of the episodes last week, I saw Paras saying ‘Maine toh Shehnaaz ko pehle hi bol diya tha mera bahar connection hai’.”</p>

      <p>And when she saw Paras is nominating her again and again, she realised that he is not the right person and she decided to increase her bond with Sidharth Shukla. I feel the two have a very strong connection because even after so many misunderstandings, they are back together". </p>
      <p>As we told you before, it’s inevitable to not form strong connections in the Bigg Boss house.<br/><br/><br/>Image Source:-  instagram/shehnaazgill</p>
