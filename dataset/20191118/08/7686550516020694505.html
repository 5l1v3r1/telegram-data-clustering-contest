      <p>Plans for 16-year-olds to get the vote in Wales in council elections will take a huge step forward today.</p>
      <p>After months of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/teenagers-set-right-vote-16-14210739">discussions and debate,</a> the Welsh Government will put forward a piece of legislation for teens to be allowed to vote in council elections. The next council election is due in 2022. The Welsh Government, run by Labour, is also expected to include an amendment as the Bill makes it way through the Senedd for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/news-opinion/the-majority-prisoners-told-should-15869901">prisoners serving four years or less to be able to vote in the same elections.</a></p>
      <p>Some prisoners, like those on remand, can already vote, but this would extend the right to those serving sentences in prison and, due to the proposed age change, in young offenders' institutes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What will the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Bill do in local elections?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower the voting age for 16 and 17-year-olds</li>
        <li>More foreign citizens can vote; currently EU and Commonwealth but this would extend it to residents of all other countries</li>
        <li>Candidates won't have to disclose their home addresses in public</li>
        <li>Independent candidates would have to declare party allegiances</li>
        <li>Tests on changing the date or places of voting</li>
        <li>Allow each council to decide whether to use First Past the Post (FPTP) or Single Transferable Vote (STV)</li>
        <li>Make it easier for people to be included on the electoral register, by giving Electoral Registration Officers the power to automatically add people to the register without the need for them to apply</li>
        <li>Enabling job sharing in cabinet positions, including the leader roll</li>
        <li>Allow councillors to attend meetings remotely</li>
        <li>Allow the voluntary merger of principal councils</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Giving the vote to teenagers was a recommendation of a panel of experts, chaired by Professor Laura McAllister. She <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/news-opinion/giving-vote-16-year-olds-15330679">admitted it was controversial,</a> but said she believed it was one of the measures needed to "resuscitate our failing democracy". AMs have <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/politics-wales-senedd-name-assembly-17056204">separately been looking at another bill</a> which would also give teens the vote, but that's for Senedd elections.</p>
      <p>The Welsh Government says the bill going forward today would mean around 75,000 young people would get the right to vote.</p>
      <p>It says it will make it easier for people to "see, influence and get involved with the work of those who represent them" as well as remove some of the barriers to people standing for election.</p>
      <p>Minister for housing and local government, Julie James, said: "We believe in strong local government. We want it to thrive, we want the people of Wales to feel well-represented and supported by modern public services, and we want the relationship between local government and the Welsh Government to be mature and focused on our shared agenda â€“ delivering better public services for everyone, helping people who need support, when and where they need it most."</p>
