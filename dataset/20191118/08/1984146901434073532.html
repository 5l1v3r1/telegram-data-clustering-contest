      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> has revealed exactly how he sustained an injury that sparked concern among <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> fans.</p>
      <p>It turns out it wasn't a bruise or an insect bite - but a small burn sustained while being a good dad.</p>
      <p>The much-loved show has returned for 2019 with Dec and best pal Ant reunited as presenters.</p>
      <p>But eagled-eyed <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here</a> fans spotted a nasty-looking wound on Dec's arm that had a few of them worried, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/breaking-declan-donnelly-bruise-how-20903662">The Mirror reports</a> .</p>
      <p>A number even reached out on social media to ask what had happened.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">The 44-year-old star</a>  responded when a fan on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  asked: “Dec- what have you done to your arm? Looks like a nasty injury.”</p>
      <p>And replying via the official And and Dec twitter account, Dec wrote: “Nothing exciting unfortunately. I scalded myself while sterilising Isla’s dummies!”</p>

      <p>“Oh Dec, life of a dad,” one follower replied - along with a couple of crying-with-laughter emojis.</p>
      <p>“Bless ya Dec you’re a good dad for Isla,” commented another.</p>
      <p>While a further fan wrote: "Brilliant!! So rock and roll lol!"</p>
      <p>Dec became a father for the first time in September last year when wife Ali Astall gave birth to their baby girl.</p>
      <p>The Geordie star previously opened up about the trials and rewards of being a parent.</p>
      <p>“No one tells you how hard being a parent is! We could have had a warning! It is literally the hardest thing I've ever done but I’m loving it,” he told the Evening Standard in February.</p>
      <p>The ITV show returned to our screens on Sunday night, with a lineup including Ian Wright, Nadine Coyle and  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn Jenner</a> , while Australian bush fires have meant a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-bush-fires-17272182">significant change to one aspect of the format</a> .</p>
      <p>
        <b>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! airs on ITV, every night of the week at 9pm.</b>
