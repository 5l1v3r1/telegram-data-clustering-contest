      <h2>One person was forced to construct their own shelter from the elements</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:42:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/emilia-bona/" target="_blank">Emilia Bona</a></address>
      <p>This heartbreaking photo shows the sad reality faced by rough sleepers <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-city-centre">on our city's streets</a> as temperatures dropped below freezing last night.</p>
      <p>As commuters made their way into work in the bitter cold, a number of workers stopped to look at this heartbreaking scene on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-city-centre">Castle Street</a> .</p>
      <p>In the doorway of the former Bank of England building, one of the city's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/homelessness">rough sleepers</a> lay stretched out in a sleeping bag.</p>
      <p>On the steps of the building, they had constructed a makeshift wall to try and shelter from the elements as temperatures plummeted overnight.</p>

      <h3>What to do if you see a rough sleeper in the cold</h3>
      <h4>Liverpool - Labre House</h4>
      <p>In Liverpool, the advice is quite simple - contact the team at the city council’s dedicated rough sleeper facility, Labre House.</p>
      <p>The new centre - which was launched late last year and is run in conjunction with homeless charity Whitechapel - offers a safe, warm space at its Camden Road hub for anyone who finds themselves on the streets or in trouble.</p>
      <p>So if you are out and about in Liverpool and spot someone sleeping on the cold streets, the advice is to contact Labre House on 0300 123 2041 and provide specific information about where the rough sleepers is.</p>
      <h4>Elsewhere in Merseyside - contact StreetLink</h4>
      <p>While Labre House is the go to number to call for anyone in Liverpool, there is also a number that people elsewhere in Merseyside can call to report a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/homelessness">homeless</a> person sleeping on dangerously cold streets.</p>
      <p>The Street Link organisation works to send alerts to local councils across the country about concerns raised regarding rough sleepers.</p>
      <p>If you are worried about someone, you can either use the website streetlink.org.uk to fill in an online form.</p>
      <p>This will let the Street Link team know exactly when and where someone has been spotted rough and this information can then be passed on to the relevant team at the council in question.</p>
      <p>If a person has been spotted during the day rather than at night - users will be offered a list of nearby services that can be accessed straight away.</p>
      <p>This can often prove to be a better option for the individual than waiting for the outreach team to come out to them at night.</p>
      <p>A Streetlink app can also be downloaded on mobile phones to make this process easier for those who are out and about on the streets.</p>
      <p>Using the app - an alert can be sent straight to StreetLink and passed on to the council who can take action to help a person in need.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In a heartbreaking act of survival, the rough sleeper had stuffed cardboard boxes into an old pallet to try and create a wall of insulation.</p>
      <p>Liverpool does have facilities for rough sleepers during the cold months - and all year round, although obviously some people have their own reasons for not feeling able to access help.</p>
      <p>The council is the only one in the country to run an all year round night shelter at Labre House in Camden Street.</p>

      <p>This works in tandem with the Whitechapel Centre charity and means there is always somewhere for people to go.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/temperatures-dropping-liverpools-rough-sleepers-17143513">the ECHO spoke to some of the city's rough sleepers</a> about their fears heading into winter and what it's like to live on the streets in the cold conditions.</p>
      <p>One man on  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-city-centre">Lord Street</a> , who did not wish to be identified, said he was fearing the worst that winter may bring.</p>
      <p>He said: "I noticed it dropping about five days ago - hopefully I'm not here on the streets when it kicks in properly.</p>
      <p>"I've spent one winter on the steps and I wouldn't ever want to do it again, that's for sure.</p>
      <p>"If you are not prepared for the winter it can be brutal - it can even kill you.</p>
      <p>He added: "I'm hoping to be in somewhere by then, I've got a few things in the pipeline - I'd rather be anywhere else than on the streets when winter comes."</p>
      <p>Another homeless man, a former serviceman, told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> : "I've been on the streets for nine months - last winter was really hard.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people when its cold, we sleep in the day and at night you just have to keep moving - because if you stop, you'll freeze."</p>
