      <p>Transport for London (TfL) fares will remain frozen for another year, Sadiq Khan has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The mayor said all fares on buses and trams, plus single pay-as-you-go Tube and DLR fares, will remain the same until the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>This is in line with the commitment he made to freeze fares for four years after becoming mayor in May 2016.</p>

      <p>Increases in these fares are set in agreement with train operators under regulations set by the Government, meaning they will rise by the July RPI inflation measure of 2.8%.</p>
      <p>Mr Khan said: “I am freezing TfL fares again next January – the fourth year in succession I have frozen them.</p>
      <p>“Alongside my £1.50 Hopper fare – which allows people unlimited changes on bus and tram journeys for free within an hour – we are making transport more affordable for millions of Londoners.</p>
      <p>“This shows what a Labour administration can do. In stark contrast, when he was mayor, Boris Johnson increased TfL fares by a staggering 42%.</p>
      <p>“Since 2016, the Tory Government has allowed national rail fares to increase by more than 10% despite all the overcrowding and delays.</p>
      <p>“If I can freeze fares and provide a better service on TfL services, it’s a disgrace that this Tory Government continues to allow failing private rail companies to get away with hiking up their fares.”</p>

      <p>Shashi Verma, director of strategy at TfL, said: “We are committed to making travelling by public transport in London as affordable and convenient as possible.</p>
      <p>“Millions of people travel using bus, Tube and rail services across London, and through our pay-as-you-go fares system we are helping to encourage more people out of their cars and on to public transport.”</p>
