      <p>This is the 18th edition of the race and Kilimanjaro Premium Lager has maintained this sponsorship right from 2003 when the race’s first edition was held with participants only doing 5km as a way of having fun as friends and colleagues.</p>
      <p>This has however over the years grown into the biggest athletics event attracting more than 11,000 participants so far from more than 56 countries all over the world hence not just promoting athletics but tourism and boosting businesses.</p>
      <p>The Kilimanjaro Marathon has no doubt due to its magnitude attracted many other sponsors in the past but, among them, only Kilimanjaro Premium Lager has featured in all the 18 editions as the main sponsor.</p>
      <p>The brand has through its innovative marketing ideas given the marathon a special push all through hence creating a lot of excitement before and during the event that is normally held in Moshi either towards end of February or early March when all roads lead to Moshi.</p>
      <p>Kilimanjaro Premium Lager has something to be proud about because the event is named after the highest mountain in Africa, which also happens to be the name of the main sponsor.</p>
      <p>The 2020 edition of the Kilimanjaro Premium Lager Marathon has already been launched officially and the vibe is already on as participants gear up for yet another exciting season.</p>
      <p>The Kilimanjaro Premium Lager Brand Manager, Pamela Kikuli, noted this is among sponsorships that the brand has upheld for a long time because of the magnitude of the event which keeps growing every year.</p>
      <p>“It is an event of its kind where runners get to run on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro as they enjoy the beautiful scenes in Moshi not forgetting the great taste of their number one beer, which is the official beer for the marathon,” she disclosed.</p>
      <p>According to the Brand Manager, they have all this time invested a lot of funds in the marathon, not just to promote sales but also to create employment through advertising, promotion and other marketing activities.</p>
      <p>“This season will also be beneficial to business people, not for Kilimanjaro Premium Lager alone, but also companies in the food, accommodation, communication and transport sectors, as well as other businesses,” she noted.</p>
      <p>According to Pamela, they will also use the Kilimanjaro Marathon to promote the new Kilimanjaro Premium Lager bottle that was launched in June this year, showcasing a new label with an African pattern because Kilimanjaro premium Lager takes pride in flying the Tanzania flag higher.</p>
      <p>Pamela urged other corporates out there to invest in the event and they can be sure of great results in terms of marketing their products and services due to the number of people involved in the event.</p>
      <p>“There are more than 11,000 participants but an equal number or more of spectators who go to cheer and feel the good ambiance along the route as they watch their loved ones running,” she noted.</p>
      <p>“Local athletes are among things that Kilimanjaro Premium Lager is out to support, as we want more and more Tanzanians to win the prizes offered by the sponsors we have come up with incentives to make Tanzanians train harder so they can win the top prizes and get the bonuses from Kilimanjaro Premium Lager.”</p>
      <p>She disclosed for the 2020 edition, apart from the prize money, the sponsors will be giving out 1.5m/- to the fist Tanzanian male athlete and a similar amount to the first Tanzanian female athlete.</p>
      <p>“This is aimed at giving them extra motivation and ensuring that as a country we do well,” she noted.</p>
      <p>She pointed out the event would not have been successful without support from other sponsors who include TIGO-21 km, Grand Malt-5km, Kilimanjaro Water, TPC Limited, Simba Cement, Barclays Bank and the official suppliers who include Kibo Palace Hotel, Keys Hotel, GardaWorld Security, Precision Air, CMC Automobiles.</p>
      <p>Pamela also appealed to participants to register on time through <a href="http://www.kilimanjaromarathon/">www.kilimanjaromarathon</a> or Tigopesa *149*20# to assure themselves of racing numbers before they sell out.</p>
      <p>“The organizers have put in place an early discounting period where participants will pay a bit less but the offer only runs up to mid-January so participants must really take advantage of this and register in plenty as it will also give the organizers ample time to plan well for the race,” she disclosed.</p>
      <p>The Kilimanjaro Premium Lager Marathon Local Race Director, John Bayo, hailed the brand for its consistency and determination to take athletics to greater heights.</p>
      <p>“An even of such magnitude requires such a serious and committed sponsors there is a lot of planning to do and al this requires funds,” he noted.</p>
      <p>According to Bayo, the best that Tanzanians can do to repay Kilimanjaro Premium Lager is by winning the top prizes in plenty and also consuming the beers after the race.</p>
      <p>Next year’s race will take place at the Moshi Cooperatives University on March 1, 2020 and will play host to a IAAF route measured 42km Marathon, a 21km Half Marathon and a 5km Fun run.</p>
      <p>The event is organized by Wild Frontiers and locally coordinated by Executive Solutions Limited.</p>
