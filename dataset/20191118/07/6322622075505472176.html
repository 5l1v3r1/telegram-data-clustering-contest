      <p>PETALING JAYA (Nov 18): Gamuda Land and Maybank Islamic has teamed up to enhance the former’s GL H.O.M.E, or Gamuda Land Home Ownership Made Easy campaign with the HouzKEY financial scheme.</p>
      <p>Under the umbrella of GL H.O.M.E with the addition of HouzKEY, potential buyers do not need to pay a down payment and no payment is required until the completion of the property, according to a press release by Gamuda Land today.</p>
      <p>The buyers are also able to lock in today’s property prices for the next five years and secure a 100% loan margin when they are ready to purchase, said the developer, adding that the buyers just have to pay three months of security deposit and a low monthly payment when they move in.</p>
      <p>“Constant innovation is one of the values that we believe in, where we equate innovation to evolution and constantly evolve with the times to improve our products, one of it being GL H.O.M.E. This is one of our proactive and innovative solutions to ease property ownership,” Gamuda Land CEO Ngan Chee Meng said in the statement.</p>
      <p>“Yet we know that we need to consistently push our boundaries to ensure this campaign stays relevant to the market and ahead of the curve. With that, we are pleased to have Maybank Islamic’s HouzKEY to be on board GL H.O.M.E, adding an alternative financial scheme to our existing solutions,” he elaborated.</p>
      <p>Maybank’s Real Estate Ventures managing director Sally Lye said the bank is confident that the combination of its financing solution with Gamuda Land’s projects can be a great opportunity for first time homebuyers and upgraders in realising their dream of owning a home.</p>
      <p>“It is a great pleasure to welcome projects by Gamuda Land to Maybank Islamic’s HouzKEY solution. Guided by our mission to humanise financial services, our priority is to provide a solution that helps to address the growing homeownership concerns in Malaysia. We truly believe that the opportunity to own a home should not be a privilege, but a necessity for all,” she said.</p>
      <p>Currently, HouzKEY is applicable for selected residential properties by Gamuda Land in the Klang Valley — HighPark Suites in Petaling Jaya; Gamuda Gardens’ first serviced apartments GAIA Residences and its landed homes Joya; Gamuda Cove’s first serviced apartments Maya Bay Residences; twentyfive.7’s first serviced apartments Amber Residence — as well as in Johor Iskandar Puteri, namely The Woodlands superlink homes in Horizon Hills.</p>
