      <h1>Violence breaks out in Hong Kong as police put university under siege</h1>

      <p>Protesters and police remain locked in a standoff that raged overnight in violent scenes similar to those that have plagued the city for months.</p>
      <p>Officers fired tear gas at demonstrators during the all-night siege at Hong Kong Polytechnic University as the region’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/high-court/">High Court</a> ruled that a ban on masks and face-coverings was unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>The ban, by Hong Kong’s government, was aimed at protesters trying to hide their identity to avoid arrest.</p>
      <p>For days, Hong Kong’s protesters had been holed up inside the university, keeping police from getting in.</p>
      <p>But after cornering the demonstrators, police raided the campus, firing teargas at hundreds of protesters – many of them young people and children.</p>
      <p>Protesters hit back with petrol bombs which exploded and created a huge fire in one of the university’s main entrances, with flames that raged but did not deter officers from entering.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Others shot at police using bows and arrows and created a barricade of umbrellas to shield themselves from police water cannons.</p>

      <p>Police surrounded the area on Sunday night and began moving in after issuing an ultimatum for people to leave the area.</p>
      <p>Everyone in the area has been warned they could be charged with rioting.</p>
      <p>Protesters claimed medical volunteers were among those arrested as the riots intensified.</p>
      <p>Activist Joshua Wong posted a picture to social media appearing to show the moment the volunteers were detained by police, their hands tied together in rows ‘like fugitives’, he said.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: ‘This is outrageous. The HK govt has lost control over police force. A violent bloodshed is under way.’</p>
      <p>At daybreak, protesters were said to have remained in control of most of the campus, with witnesses saying some were seen making petrol bombs, or resting while wearing gas masks.</p>
      <p>Some schools have closed today over safety concerns.</p>

      <p>The protests in Hong Kong entered their sixth month this weekend with more violence that has disrupted the city as it begins its working week.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Demonstrations started peacefully in early June, sparked by proposed legislation that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China.</p>
      <p>But by the time the bill was withdrawn, the protests had hardened and broadened into a resistance movement against the territory’s government and Beijing.</p>
      <p>The president of the university has said in a video message that police have agreed to suspend their use of force if protesters agree to co-operate.</p>
      <p>Jin-Guang Teng said police would allow protesters to leave and he would accompany them to the police station to ensure their cases would be processed fairly.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I hope that you will accept the proposed temporary suspension of force and leave the campus in a peaceful manner.’</p>
      <p>It appears unlikely that the protesters will accept the offer, given that they are likely to be arrested.</p>
      <p>According to reporters on the scene, a few hundred protesters streamed out of the campus this morning in an apparent bid to escape but they were driven back by more police tear gas.</p>
      <p>Police issued a ‘wanted’ notice on Facebook for a woman who was injured during the clashes, claiming protesters stopped an ambulance and removed her from police custody.</p>
      <p>In a statement they said protesters hurled rocks and bricks while officers escorting the woman were trapped inside the ambulance.</p>

      <p>One police officer fired three shots from his weapon, but the police say the shots did not hit anyone.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The statement says the woman, 20, had been arrested for participating in an unlawful assembly and that anyone who aided her would face the serious charge of assisting an offender, carrying up to 10 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the high court issued a ruling today that said the ban on face masks infringes on fundamental rights more than is reasonably necessary for the furtherance of its goals.</p>
      <p>The government used its emergency powers to impose the ban last month.</p>
      <p>The court said it did not consider anti-mask laws unconstitutional in general, but in this case, the law infringed on fundamental rights further than was reasonably necessary.</p>
