        <b>Former f(x) singer Amber Liu has broken her silence on the race row to apologise for her ‘ignorant’ comments about a black man’s arrest by a white police officer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 27-year-old received backlash after a video clip emerged of her reacting to footage of a black man being arrested by a police officer for eating a sandwich on a subway platform in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>In the clip, Amber is heard saying the black man ‘deserved’ to be reprimanded for his actions and believed he showed a lack of ‘respect’ towards the officer. However in the clip, her friend argued that she is culturally unable to understand what the black community goes through in regards to systemic racism.</p>
      <p>Amber has now spoken out about her comments to insist she stands with the African-American community and #BlackLivesMatter.</p>
      <p>In her apology statement posted on Twitter, Amber said: ‘I am so sorry. I saw a video clip, made an ignorant, snap judgement, and I majorly messed up. It was my fault for not being more aware of how the systemic racism in the United States has continued and gotten worse while I spent the last 10 years overseas.’</p>

      <p>The K-Pop star insisted: ‘I 100% do not stand for racism and discrimination. It angers me that he was singled out because of the colour of his skin. It is completely unust and I am so sorry for not seeing the whole situation and jumping to a conclusion. I’m sorry for hurting you guys.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve always stood for equality, I’ve always stood for love, I believe in #BlackLivesMatter, and I’m so sorry I’ve negatively affected so many people because of my ignorance and I will continue to educate myself in this matter.’</p>

      <p>Discussing the black man’s actions in the video, which went viral last week, Amber said: ‘He was being disrespectful, you don’t have to act that way towards a police officer… know your rights but show some type of respect.’</p>
      <p>Amber’s male friend interjected: ‘That’s going towards a touchy area because culturally I don’t think we understand what the black community goes through so they respond way different to officers than we do.’</p>
      <p>Referring to the black community, a female friend added: ‘They’re tired of it.’</p>

      <p>In video of the man’s arrest, the white police officer says: ‘You’ll end up going to jail,’ to which the black man replies: ‘I’m not going to jail for eating a f***ing sandwich’.</p>
      <p>The officer claims the arrest would be for ‘resisting arrest’ which the man denies.</p>
      <p>He is later seen being placed in handcuffs by two police officers with another standing close by.</p>
      <p>Last month, Amber and the rest of f(x) were left devastated by the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/k-pop-star-sulli-found-dead-aged-25-10913196/">death of their bandmate Sulli,</a> who died on 13 October in an apparent suicide.</p>
