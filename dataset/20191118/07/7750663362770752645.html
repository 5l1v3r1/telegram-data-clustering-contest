      <p>That is the view of former Ferrari driver <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rubens-barrichello/"><b>Rubens Barrichello</b></a>, who was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-schumacher/"><b>Michael Schumacher</b></a>'s teammate in the team's ultra-successful period between 2000 and 2005.</p>
      <p>Barrichello, a Sao Paulo local, attended the Interlagos race at the weekend and said of the 2019 season: "It was a hard fought championship and much nicer than the last three or four years."</p>
      <p>As for Ferrari's push to finally beat <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mercedes/"><b>Mercedes</b></a>, the 47-year-old told La Gazzetta dello Sport: "I would say that Ferrari is missing nothing, or very, very little.</p>
      <p>"There have been victories, pole positions, many points. To tell you the truth, they are lacking very little."</p>
      <p>Barrichello was also asked about rumours that Sao Paulo could lose the race to Rio de Janeiro.</p>
      <p>"I have nothing to say about it," he insisted. "I do not enter any controversy, because basically I don't know what is true and what is not."</p>
