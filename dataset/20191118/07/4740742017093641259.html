      <h2>The project to widen the major commuter route in and out of Portishead has been delayed by five months</h2>

      <p>A £1.6 million pound scheme to ease congestion in and out of Portishead needs to be completed in the next four months – or funding for the project will be lost.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset-council">North Somerset Council</a> is facing a race against time to complete the scheme to widen Wyndham Way by March next year.</p>
      <p>The scheme has been mainly funded by the Government as part of its national congestion relief scheme.</p>

      <p>A caveat of the funding was the work had to be completed by the end of March 2020.</p>
      <p>Work on the widening was due to start in May but was delayed.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset">North Somerset</a> Council has only just agreed to appoint Skanska to carry out the work.</p>
      <p>Contractors now have just four months – with the threat of bad weather and Christmas holidays in the way – to meet the deadline.</p>
      <p>The scheme will see the A369 Wyndham Way widened between the Sheepway and the 'sail' roundabout to create a second lane for traffic heading into the town.</p>

      <p>The move will increase capacity for traffic heading into Portishead at rush hour and reduce journey times.</p>
      <p>Large tailbacks can often build up into the town from commuters who work out of the area but live in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/portishead">Portishead</a>.</p>
      <p>The outbound road leaving the town would remain as a single carriageway.</p>
      <p>Council bosses have admitted the delays and tight timescale which has ensued is ‘not ideal’ but are ‘confident’ the work will be completed in time.</p>

      <p>North Somerset Council spokesman Richard Turner said: “A decision notice has been approved for our contractor Skanska to carry out the work.</p>
      <p>“We are now working with Skanska to agree a detailed schedule of work.</p>
      <p>“We expect work to start in early December and are confident it will be completed by the end of March.”</p>
      <p>The delay in work commencing is due to changes being made to the plan following a consultation on the improvements earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Initially it was expected the scheme would cost £1 million.</p>
      <p>But the costs have now increased as a result of the changes to £1.6 million.</p>
      <p>Extra funding of £380,000 has come from Highways England with the other money coming from 106 contributions from local developers and from the Local Transport Plan.</p>
      <p>The work to Wyndham Way is part of a wider scheme which will also see improvements to the M5 Portishead motorway junction carried out by Highways England.</p>

      <p>A scheme is currently being drawn up to put in an additional lane on the M5 sliproad onto the junction 19 roundabout.</p>
      <p>The work will see the number of lanes on the southbound motorway exit slip road at junction 19 increased from two to three.</p>
      <p>The project is being drawn up to tackle the large queues that form on the inside lane of the southbound carriageway on the Avonmouth Bridge.</p>
      <p>At peak times - such as morning and evening rush hour - queues can often stretch the length of the bridge and as far back as the Avonmouth junction.</p>
      <p>As a result some motorists are trying to cut in from other lanes, causing accidents.</p>
      <p>The work to junction 19 is due to start this autumn and be completed by March 2020.</p>
