      <p>Listed law firm DWF managed to boost its revenues in the first half despite persistent political uncertainty, it said today.</p>
      <p>In a trading statement to the City, DWF said it had increased group revenues by at least 10 per cent in the six months to the end of October.</p>

      <p>Chief executive Andrew Leaitherland said the performance has been “robust” in the face of Brexit disruption that has weighed on business activity.</p>
      <p>“The first half of the year has seen a number of important milestones achieved as we continue to deliver on our initial public offering (IPO) promises, developing the business in our first year as a listed entity,” he said.</p>
      <p>DWF’s floatation in March, the first main market listing for a law firm, valued the business at £366m. The company had been aiming for a higher valuation, understood to be between £400m and £600m.</p>
      <p>In today’s update, DWF said organic activity had underpinned the “vast majority” of its growth.</p>
      <p>The firm said this was driven by strong growth in its International and Connected Services divisions, which are expected to record increases of approximately 29% and 18% respectively.</p>
      <p>DWF’s net debt hit £49.5m during the first half – a £9.5m drop compared the same period last year, but an increase on the £35.3m it reported for the year ending 30 April.</p>
      <p>The company said this increase “primarily reflects the normal cyclicality of partner tax payments in addition to the £3m dividend payment in September”.</p>
      <p>The firm increased its net partner headcount by 20 on a full-time equivalent basis during the first half – including the recruitment of 15 senior hires, 14 partners and one director to its international business.</p>
      <p>Leaitherland said DWF would continue to supplement organic activity with “selective M&amp;A” going forward, adding: “our associations and broad market reach providing a strong pipeline of opportunities”.</p>

      <p>“We continue to be recognised for our innovative approach… and remain focused on delivering our strategy and purpose of transforming legal services through our people, for our clients,” he added.</p>
      <p>DWF will announce its full interim results on 11 December.</p>
