        <b>There have been tense scenes in Hong Kong amid violent clashes between protesters and police at a university campus in the city.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sunday had seen roads and entry points to the Polytechnic University (PolyU) blocked, as some protesters threw petrol bombs and other projectiles as they worked to lock down the site.</p>
      <p>Police, meanwhile, threatened to use "live bullets" if anti-government protesters used lethal weapons.</p>
      <p>According to local media, police used tear gas to block multiple efforts by protesters to leave the scene - with some people arrested as they tried to flee the area.</p>
      <p>On Monday afternoon local time, police allowed Red Cross volunteers to enter the university to tend to injured people inside the campus.</p>
      <p>Monday evening, meanwhile, saw thousands of people gather on the streets around the campus calling for the trapped demonstrators to be released.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/11/18/hong-kong-police-enter-polyu-campus-following-day-long-battle-officers-fire-live-warning-shots-nearby/"><i>Hong Kong Free Press</i> reports</a></b> that dozens of arrests have been reported over the past 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of people were reported to remain on campus on Monday as police continued to surround PolyU.</p>

      <p>Local campaigners called on the international community to support the protesters.</p>
      <p>Prominent activist Nathan Law said  police had used "endless shots of tear gas and other weapons", describing their actions as "outrageous".</p>
      <p>In a statement, local police denied reports they had 'raided' the campus early on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The said: "Police continue to conduct dispersal and arrest operation. In the meantime, rioters gathering inside the Polytechnic University set fire and caused extensive damage."</p>

      <p>In a later statement, they continued to urge anyone inside to "drop their weapons and dangerous items, remove their gas masks and leave".</p>
      <p>In another development today, Hong Kong's high court ruled that a government law banning the wearing of masks during protests was unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Carrie Lam announced the use of the emergency powers - which have not been used for more than 50 years - in October after months of street protests.</p>
      <p>However, the <b><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038184/anti-mask-law-quell-hong-kong-protests-ruled">South China Morning Post reports</a></b> that judges today ruled the mask ban was 'incompatible' with the city's 'Basic Law'.</p>
      <p>The major protests began in Hong Kong during the summer over a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed authorities to send suspects to mainland China.</p>
      <p>Despite the bill having now been withdrawn, the movement soon morphed into larger pro-democracy protests - calling for free elections and an inquiry into the police handling of the demonstrations.</p>
