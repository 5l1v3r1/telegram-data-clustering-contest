      <p>A married man who has fallen in love with his daughter’s ex-boyfriend – who is half his age – has insisted that it is the ‘real deal’ and not a mid-life crisis.</p>
      <p>Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, 50, has broken off his 32-year relationship with husband Tony after he fell for Scott Hutchison, 25.</p>
      <p>Barrie and Tony were dubbed Britain’s first gay fathers in 1999 when a surrogate gave birth to their twins, Saffron and Aspen.</p>
      <p>Now, Barrie is in love with 19-year-old Saffron’s ex and the whole family are living together under one roof at their home in Florida.</p>
      <p>Tony is referred to as Dad, Barrie is Daddy and Scott is stepdad.</p>

      <p>Scott and Saffron had previously spoken about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/17/teen-daughter-britains-first-gay-dads-also-wants-surrogate-twins-7319977/">having their own surrogate baby</a>, saying their relationship was never sexual.</p>
      <p>Barrie told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10361253/first-gay-dads-split-daughter-boyfriend/">Sun</a>: ‘I’ve fallen in love with Scott and he has done the same. I feel stupid at my age to have these feelings about someone other than Tony who is half my age.</p>

      <p>‘But when you know something is right, it’s right. We have not made definite plans but I would like to marry Scott. I’m not having a midlife crisis. This is the real deal.’</p>
      <p>He acknowledged that not everyone will ‘get it’, but insists that his family situation is more stable than many other families.</p>
      <p>He added that ‘Dad’s got a new fella and we are one bigger happy family instead.’</p>

      <p>Barrie added on Facebook: ‘I just want to thank those of you that have messaged already regarding the story.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not sure what the big deal is myself, things don’t always work out in relationships for one reason or another, but Tony and I are both very happy about the way things have turned out and regardless of the negativity regarding our relationship, we will both be there for each other through this very difficult time.’</p>
      <p>The couple are worth around £40million and have homes in Danbury, Essex, and the US. Barrie is CEO of the British Surrogacy Centre of America which he launched in 2000 and which offers surrogacy services in multiple countries.</p>
      <p>After Saffron and Aspen arrived, Tony and Barrie had another three children, Orlando, Jasper and Dallas.</p>
      <p>The two oldest children will be 20 next month.</p>
