      <p>LED chip maker Opto Tech expects shipments for fine-pitch LED displays in 2019 to increase 30% on year due to strong demand from the North America and Europe markets mainly arising from US-China trade disputes, according to the company.</p>
      <p>The shipments from the product line are mostly on a project basis and Opto Tech expects to land orders from 50-60% of the existing clients' procurement projects in 2020, the company said.</p>
      <p>Opto Tech said it has reached a global market share of 85% for Si-based sensor chips used in smart wearable devices and, in addition to existing US-, China- and South Korea-based vendors, has recently obtained orders from a new US-based vendor, with shipments to begin in 2020. Revenues from Si-based sensors used in smart wearable devices for 2020 are expected to grow 15-20%, Opto Tech indicated. Currently, it has fully utilized production capacity for Si-based sensors.</p>
      <p>Besides China- and South Korea-based clients, Opto Tech expects to land orders for AlGaInP red-light and IR (infrared) LED chips from new clients based in the US and Europe in 2020. Opto Tech is also cooperating with Japan-based vendors to develop fine-pitch LED displays and LED automotive displays using AlGaInP red-light LED chips, with shipments expected to begin in first-quarter 2020.</p>
      <p>Opto Tech posted consolidated revenues of NT$1.547 billion (US$50.7 million), gross margin of 33.12%, net operating profit of NT$236.4 million, net profit of NT$197.9 million and net EPS of NT$0.48 for third-quarter 2019, leading to consolidated revenues of NT$4.127 billion, gross margin of 30.86%, net operating profit of NT$554.8 million, net profit of NT$459.5 million and net EPS of NT$1.07 for January-September.</p>
      <p>Si-based sensor chips accounted for 50.1% of the January-September consolidated revenues; visible-light and IR LED chips, for 25.4%; and LED fine-pitch displays, LED lighting and LED automotive displays, 24.4%.</p>
      <p>Opto Tech has reported consolidated revenues of NT$435 million for October, decreasing 13.14% sequentially but increasing 2.58% on year, and those of NT$4.562 billion for January-October grew 0.75% on year.</p>
