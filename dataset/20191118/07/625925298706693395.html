      <h1>Which parties and countries chair the EP committees?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:49:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:49</time> by <a rel="author">Elena Sánchez Nicolás</a></address>
      <p>The MEPs in the European Parliament's committees are divided up among 20 standing committees and two sub-committees (Human Rights (DROI) and Security and Defence (SEDE)), specialising in concrete areas of EU's policymaking.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of a new legislature, the parliament decides which MEPs will sit in which committees - based on the preferences expressed by them.</p>
      <p>Each committee elects a chair and up to four vice-chairs amongst its full members</p>
      <p>However, the size of committees can vary significantly - from 21 (fisheries, the smallest) to 71 (foreign affairs, the largest) members.</p>
      <p>Belonging to a political group has a direct impact on the representation of MEPs in the different committees.</p>
      <h3>Unequal breakdown</h3>
      <p>The biggest group of the EU parliament, the European People's Party (EPP) has the largest representation (33.3 percent) of chair committees, followed by the socialists (S&amp;D) with 23.8 percent and the liberals Renew Europe with 19 percent.</p>
      <p>However, the smallest political groups receive very few committee chairs.</p>
      <p>This is the case for the Greens/EFA and the conservatives (ECR), which have only two committee chairs (9.5 percent) and the leftist group NGU/GUE, which only leads the committee on regional development, with French MEP Younous Omarjee (4.8 percent).</p>
      <p>According to the parliament, "non-attached members can nominate individuals to committees and delegations, but they are unlikely to be elected to positions as committee chairs or to be appointed rapporteurs on significant dossiers".</p>
      <p>The breakdown of the parliament's chair committees by nationality is also uneven.</p>
      <p>Germany and France are significantly represented with five and four committee chairs respectively leading important EU policymaking areas, such as foreign affairs, agriculture, security or environment.</p>
      <p>Three Belgian MEPs lead the committees of the internal market and consumer protection, budget and the sub-committee of human rights.</p>
      <p>The UK, Spain, and Italy have each two committee chairs, while Sweden and Slovakia have only one.</p>
      <h3>Final vacancy</h3>
      <p>Since the withdrawal of the chair of the committee on industry, research, and energy (ITRE) <a href="https://euobserver.com/news/146615">Romanian MEP Adina-Ioana Vălean</a>, who is currently commissioner-designate for transport, central and eastern European countries are largely under-represented at committee chair level.</p>
      <p>In replacing Vălean, the members of ITRE must try to keep gender and geographical balance.</p>
      <p>Additionally, it can be expected that the chair committee will be from the EPP (the same political party of the commissioner) -designate, according to a spokesperson of the parliament.</p>
      <p>However, other parties can also present their candidates, who are considered first by the committee coordinators before all members of ITRE have a final vote.</p>
      <p>Likewise, ITRE will have a new chair committee only once the new commission is approved, since Vălean is still officially an MEP.</p>
