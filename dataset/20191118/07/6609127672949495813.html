      <p>Two years on, he hopes his international career is really starting now.</p>

      <p>The Rangers midfielder was excellent as <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> secured a 2-1 win in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Jack has had to be patient over the last 24 months — due to fierce competition in his position.</p>
      <p>But he looked the part as he won his third cap and now wants to nail down a place in Steve Clarke’s side.</p>
      <p>Jack said: “I hope it is starting now. I’ve always said I want to play for Scotland and be a part of it so I hope that is the case.</p>

      <p>“I hope I did enough here to get the nod again in the future. Obviously I can’t decide that, but I enjoyed every minute of it against Cyprus. It was good to be in there.</p>
      <p>"I’ve come away with the squad, worked hard and the gaffer has been really good with me. It’s obviously a proud moment every time you get called up or get a cap.</p>
      <p>“Growing up, you always want to play for your country. I am proud to do so. You see games at Hampden when there are full houses and the atmosphere that creates.</p>
      <p>“You want to be part of it and I don’t want to stop. I want to keep going and I want more.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, this can be a box ticked and I get the nod in the future. It was good, I enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>“It was obviously a tough night and a tough test. But it was job done and we got the win we wanted.</p>
      <p>“There are no easy games at this level but I felt I settled in fine. First half, we did well. Second half, they scored and that was a bit of a sickener.</p>
      <p>“But we showed a great attitude to come back and get in front again. The manager did say that if we face adversity we have to stand up to it.</p>

      <p>“We did that so, all round, I’m delighted we got the job done.”</p>
      <p>Jack combined well with Celtic rival Callum McGregor in central midfield, with John McGinn playing as a No 10.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay was injured and seems his direct competitor but the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> man doesn’t think it’s that simple.</p>
      <p>He said: “I have played with Callum before for the Under-21s. It was good. I enjoyed playing with everyone to be honest.</p>
      <p>“I felt we dug in well when we had to and we showed a bit of resilience. Is it a case of me v Scott? Not at all. If you look at the midfield there is talent right through it.</p>
      <p>“Kenny McLean and Scott are out with injuries. Then you have myself, Callum, John McGinn, John Fleck, Stuart Armstrong.</p>
      <p>“The list is endless because there is that much talent in the one position.</p>
      <p>“Every time I get a chance, I just want to stake a claim. That’s all I can do.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure the other boys are the same when they play.</p>
      <p>“We are all working for the same goal and want to get to a major tournament.”</p>
      <p>Jack has excelled against Porto and Feyenoord for Rangers this season — so Cyprus were never going to scare him.</p>
      <p>But the Ibrox midfielder believes more Europa League games have developed him.</p>
      <p>He said: “The experience I have gained playing in Europe always helps, of course it does.</p>
      <p>"I am playing for a good team at club level and I am facing good opposition in the likes of Porto and Feyenoord.</p>
      <p>“That does help when I come away on these trips. I am hoping for a successful season for club and country. Everything is going well so far.</p>
      <p>“Club level has been very good. I have been doing well in Europe and now I’ve got a start for my country after being called up.</p>

      <p>“As I said, I really enjoyed it and I am just glad that we got the win.”</p>
      <p>Jack looks set to keep his place for Kazakhstan tomorrow as Scotland attempt to secure third place in Group I.</p>
      <p>Another win would help boost confidence ahead of the March play-offs but Clarke’s men aren’t taking anything for granted.</p>
      <p>Jack said: “It’s all positive. And we are looking to now take that into Tuesday night. We all want to build momentum and get wins.</p>
      <p>“It has not all been positive in this campaign, but hopefully we can go three wins on the spin on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>“Now you want to put in the performances to stake a claim for the huge games in March.</p>
      <p>“If we can get the wins and build momentum then hopefully we will go into the play-offs with a real chance.</p>
      <p>“Getting the win in Cyprus was great but in football you know that everything can turn very quickly.</p>
      <p>“You can’t rest on it. It’s about more hard work and keeping things going. We can’t get carried away by anything now.</p>
      <p>"We have won two on the bounce.</p>
      <p>“But we want to get three and then try and get Scotland to a major tournament, which would be a great achievement for us.”</p>
