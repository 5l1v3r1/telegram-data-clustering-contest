      <p>There is some evidence that the USD will behave differently in election years depending on whether a Republican or Democratic presidential candidate is leading in the polls, explained Richard Franulovich, Head of FX Strategy at Westpac.</p>
      <h3>Key quotes:</h3>
      <p>"The conventional wisdom is that Republican candidates are more business and market-friendly and as a result equities and the USD tend to perform better when expectations favour of a Republican presidency. Slide two shows the performance of the DXY index in the nine presidential election years since 1984. We split the small sample into two sub-groups – the DXY’s performance in those election years when a Republican candidate led in the polls (Bush (2004, 2000), Bush (1988) and Reagan (1984)) and those years when a Democratic candidate led in the polls (Clinton (2016), Obama (2012, 2008), Clinton (1996, 1992))."<br/> <br/>"While the DXY index ultimately tends to finish the year higher regardless of the winner in a presidential election year (rising in 8 of the last 9 election years), it nevertheless spends the bulk of an election year on the front foot when a Republican candidate has been leading in the polls and tends to underperform for much of the year (until Oct/Nov) when a Democrat candidate is leading. See slide two. The caveat is that our sample is small and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> and global growth can be just as influential in driving the USD. Moreover, the make-up of Congress will be a crucial factor shaping how much of a president’s agenda can ever become legislative reality. That said, there is some historical evidence backing the view that markets may trade more cautiously in 2020 if a Democratic candidate, especially a strong left-leaning candidate, has a strong lead in the polls."</p>
