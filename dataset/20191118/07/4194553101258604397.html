      <h1>Good news for Liverpool as Sadio Mane, Jordan Henderson and Virgil van Dijk all get bonus rest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:37:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>International breaks can often be the bane of Liverpool fans lives, but this time around, there could be a few more positive things to take from the lack of Premier League football.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane was taken off at the interval in Senegal’s fixture against Eswatini on Saturday – but it has been revealed that it was for disciplinary reasons, rather than an injury.</p>
      <p>The winger was already on a yellow card, according to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-fans-issued-huge-sigh-20904872">Daily Star</a>, meaning that his coaches did not want to risk him picking up another one in the second 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson both came home early from England duty, with neither of their injuries and illness suspected to be long-term issues, while Virgil van Dijk left the Dutch team because of ‘personal reasons’.</p>
      <p>With Van Dijk, it is unclear at this moment in time exactly why he was allowed to leave the Netherlands training early, but it does not sound like an injury.</p>
      <p>With all of those players getting a bit of a rest over the international fixtures, Jurgen Klopp will be hoping to see the benefit over the next few weeks, when there will be little time to rest for any of his squad.</p>
