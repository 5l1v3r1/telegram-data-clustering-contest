      <p>"They survived!" reports a local CBS news station, revisiting nearly two dozen students at Adelphi University who went a full week without their cell phones. <a href="https://mobile.slashdot.org/~schwit1">schwit1</a> shares their report: <i>It was part of a college course <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/14/students-ditch-phone-changed-lives/">intended to break the powerful addiction of smartphones</a>... an Adelphi University course called "Life Unplugged" where students did the unthinkable one week ago -- handed over their smartphones. "I'm freaking out, I could probably cry right now," one student said. It was a bold experiment to recognize today's compulsive relationships with ever present devices. Seven days later, "who's excited they're getting their phones back today?" Professor Donna Freitas asked.<br/><br/>Gone were the nerves and the shakes. "Everything is perfect right now. I'm having a lot better relationships... it's a stress free environment no pressure about social media," Jacob Dannenberg said.<br/><br/>"I think it's really refreshing and relaxing... I was able to fall asleep a lot easier," student Adrianna Cigliano. <br/><br/>They managed to find their way, even without GPS for a week. "I just had to take the same route everywhere," one student joked. They were also more productive. "Doing homework was 100 percent easier. I got it done faster, I was in the zone," Cigliano said.<br/><br/>Prof. Freitas says it's important for everyone to assess their addiction. "Are the conveniences worth it because the drawback are pretty significant," Freitas said. "The face that no one can focus, that my students can't sleep... They feel bad about themselves because of social media, the list goes on and on."</i> <br/>Their reunions with the phones "went sour quickly as endless notifications piled up," the article notes. "Oh my God this is so bad...!" they quote one student as saying.<br/><br/>"I just want to shut it off now....!"</p>
