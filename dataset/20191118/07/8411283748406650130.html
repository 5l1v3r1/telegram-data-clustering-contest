      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:31:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:31</time> by <a rel="author">Julian Ho, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Wireless networking solution provider AboCom System has begun shipping VCSEL chips for 100G and 200G optical transceivers and plans to ramp up output in the third quarter of 2020 with an additional investment of NT$100-200 million (US$3.279-6.559 million), according to company chairman Chi Cheng-Hsiao.</p>
      <p>The company, which sources epitaxial wafers from IQE and designs VCSEL chips in house, said it will target emerging VCSEL business opportunities in Taiwan and China, Chi said.</p>
      <p>AboCom is also offering 25G VCSEL chips, and market sources indicated that the company is offering 25G chips with prices ranging from US$6-7 per unit compared to US$7-9 from more established players such as Broadcom.</p>
      <p>With a backlog of orders on hand, the company is expected to see its revenue stay flat or increase moderately in the fourth quarter of 2019, Chi estimated. It posted revenues of NT$452 million in the third quarter, up 101.83% from a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Judging that AboCom already garnered revenues of NT$1.249 billion for the first 10 months of 2019, industry observers expect its revenues for all of the year to reach over NT$1.5 billion.</p>
