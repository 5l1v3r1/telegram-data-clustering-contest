      <p>TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co Ltd is in talks with big music labels Universal Music , Sony Music and Warner Music for global licensing deals to include their songs on its new music subscription service, the <i>Financial Times </i>reported on Sunday.</p>
      <p>ByteDance is looking to launch its music streaming as soon as next month, initially in emerging markets such as India, Indonesia and Brazil, before a future opening in the United States, the <i>FT</i> reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>In addition to on-demand music, ByteDanceâ€™s app will include a library of short video clips for listeners to search through and synch to songs as they listen, the report added.</p>
      <p>ByteDance has not given a name to its music app yet and pricing remains unclear, although it is expected to cost less than the $10-a-month charged by Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc and others in the United States, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The company was not immediately available for comment on Sunday.</p>
