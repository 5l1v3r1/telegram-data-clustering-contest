        <b>Here's presenting the official first trailer of Good Newwz starring Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani</b>
      </p>
      <p>For a few days now, there has been a tremendous buzz around Karan Johar's much-anticipated film Good Newwz. Some quirky posters featuring Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani were dropped online leaving us impatient for the trailer. Yesterday, the makers had announced that the 'due date' of the trailer is November 18, and voila they have kept their promise. The Good Newwz for the star couples has finally been 'delivered'. Well, the trailer of the film is out now and it will surely make you laugh out loud. The movie is termed as ‘the biggest goof-up of the year’ and we can see why. </p>
      <p>The trailer not only promises to be an out-and-out entertaining film but it also intrigues us with an equally important social message for us. In the trailer, the first couple, Akshay and Kareena are seen as a rich and stylish couple, who take the IVF route to conceive a baby after 7 years of marriage, while Diljit and Kiara who come from a traditional family, too take the same route to have a baby. However, the goof up starts now when both the ladies are pregnant but with a twist that none of you would have expected that to see. Watch the trailer below: </p>

      <p>Before hitting the trailer online, Akshay shared another new poster on her handle where all the four are seen hugging each other while a cartoonish sperm devil is seen around them. While sharing the poster, he captioned it as, “As you can see, we're all in this together!” Good Newwz has been helmed by Raj Mehta and produced under Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions. It is slated to hit the big screens on December 27, 2019.</p>
