      <p>Rwanda is dispatching two youth soccer teams for the tournament, whereas Uganda is expected to outfits 10 teams.<br/>The annual event which clocks its 10th Anniversary this year is scheduled for Arusha from December 10.</p>
      <p>The Rwandan teams that have so far confirmed to come to Tanzania for the ‘Chipkizi Cup 2019’ include, ‘Right to Play’ and ‘Saint Vincent Palloti Real Soccer Academy,’ according to the event coordinator, Alfred Itaeli, Kenya and Uganda have not yet named theirs.</p>
      <p>Organizers say that 120 football teams made up of over 2000 young soccer players, mostly pupils and students are expected to take part in the 2019 installment of the East Africa soccer tourney.</p>
      <p>Running under the Arusha-based, sporting talent recruiting and promotional institution of Future Stars Academy (FSA), the East African Youth Football Tournament, is going to bring to Arusha teams from, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Burundi and Zanzibar Isles, as well as the host Tanzania mainland.</p>
      <p>Tanzania’s teams include hosts, Future Stars Academy team, Upendo Friends Schools, Arusha Soccer Center, Arusha Youth Development, UWC (former International School of Moshi), Tanzanite, New Vision and Arusha Meru International, all based in Arusha.</p>
      <p>Dodoma brings the Fountain Gate team, Dar es Salaam will enter Azam FC and Magnet Academy, Singida comes with Singida United, Kilimanjaro comes with Black Rhinos from Moshi and Zanzibar once again brings into the fold the last year’s defending champions, JKU.</p>
      <p>Kenya will bring over 60 youth teams, making the country have the highest entry yet, while Uganda will outfit nearly 10 clubs for the Arusha Chipkizi Cup. Tanzania is still registering more teams in addition to the confirmed 12.</p>
      <p>To be staged at the Tanganyika Game Trackers (TGT) grounds from December 10 to 15 this year, the Chipkizi Cup marks its 10th anniversary in 2019 after its premier in 2009. Registration ends on November 15 2019.</p>
      <p>The Director of Future Stars, Alfred Itaeli, stated here that for the last 10 years, the Chipkizi Cup tournament has produced a number of promising youth footballers, including those that have managed to feature in international soccer events outside the country.</p>
      <p>Chipkizi Cup, the East Africa Youth Football Championship, is usually a tourney for young and mostly upcoming players aged between 9 and 20 years of age and these usually fall under the pupils and students brackets.</p>
      <p>Zakayo Mjema, the Arusha Regional Football Association (ARFA) secretary general, commented about the Chikizi Cup, saying that this year all national soccer leaders and officials in the country will attend the competition to see for themselves, how the youths play.</p>
      <p>He was however concerned that it is usually other countries that get to field more teams and most players even though Tanzania is the one that always host these tourneys.</p>
      <p>According to ARFA officials, from next year, the Tanzania Football Federation will slot the Chipkizi Cup into the TFF calendars so that they may now be recognized as part of official country tourneys.</p>
      <p>Kenya shone in the 2018 instalment of the Chipkizi Cup, topping the Under-13 category for both male and female teams. Zanzibar managed to top the Under-20 slots.</p>
