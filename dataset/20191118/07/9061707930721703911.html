      <h1>Ryanair jet collided with Jet2 aircraft during taxiing at East Midlands Airport</h1>
      <h2>The collision led to a urgent safety review</h2>

      <p>Two passenger jets collided at East Midlands Airport after thick fog caused confusion in the control tower.</p>
      <p>The Boeing 737 jets hit each other on the morning of April 30 this year. The accident saw the wing of a taxiing Ryanair plane clip the tail of a Jet2 airliner sitting in a parking bay at the airfield.</p>
      <p>Neither of the planes was carrying passengers at the time. However, the potential seriousness of the incident led to an urgent safety review, <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/ryanair-737-passenger-jet-hit-3547554">reports LeicestershireLive.</a></p>
      <p>Air safety body the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the Ryanair plane, a 737-700 (EI-SEV) with two flight crew on board, was taxiing towards the airport’s central apron, having arrived from Stansted Airport and its passengers disembarked.</p>
      <p>The Jet2 737-300 (G-GDFB) aircraft meanwhile was parked up and empty.</p>
      <p>An accident report by the AAIB stated: “EI-SEV was taxiing to park on stand 22 at East Midlands Airport and the routing passed behind G-GDFB on stand 24.</p>
      <p>“As EI-SEV passed behind G-GDFB its winglet struck the other aircraft’s right horizontal stabiliser.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/castle-donington">The Castle Donington airport </a>was operating under low visibility procedures (LVPs) at the time on account of fog. The visibility range on the ground was up to 325m.</p>

      <p>Due to the poor weather, and their elevated position in the control tower, “air traffic controllers could not see the aircraft, taxiway or apron”, said investigators.</p>
      <p>And because it was stationary, the Jet2 plane did not appear on the controllers’ surface movement radar (SMR) display.</p>
      <p>In addition, the thick fog rendered the airport CCTV useless.</p>
      <p>The report stated: “With no other information about stand occupancy available to them, air traffic control were unaware that stand 24 was occupied.</p>
      <p>“Accordingly, the ground movements controller cleared EI-SEV to taxi the shortest route to stand 22.”</p>
      <p>It added: “The poor visibility rendered the parked aircraft on stand 24 invisible to air traffic control.</p>
      <p>“Had visibility been better, they would have had an opportunity to visually acquire the obstruction and offer a different route.”</p>
      <p>The report stated that when <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/ryanair">the Ryanair flight crew</a> saw the Jet2 plane, they noted that the space available to pass was “tight”.</p>
      <p>But the pilot also was reassured, as they were following the taxi lane centreline and the parked aircraft was on its stop bar, that there would be enough room.</p>

      <p>They reduced speed to a “slow walking place” as the co-pilot monitored the right wing tip, but, as the two aircraft crossed, the Ryanair plane’s wing <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/jet2com">struck the Jet2 plane’s tail.</a></p>
      <p>The Ryanair captain brought the aircraft to a halt and immediately reported the collision to area traffic controllers.</p>
      <p>Both planes suffered serious damage in the collision but have since been repaired.</p>
      <p>Nobody was injured in the incident.</p>
      <p>The AAIB report stated: “The fallibility of the human eye in accurately judging relative distance at range seduced the crew into thinking that safe separation had been achieved.”</p>
      <p>It added that the flight crew was unaware that “less than minimum standard taxi separations” existed between parking stands 22 to 25.</p>
      <p>Investigators found that a lack of published guidance and warnings to alert controllers and flight crew to the potential risk was a contributing factor to the accident.</p>
      <p>Following the collision, the airport closed stand 22, pending a safety review, and conducted a survey of parking stands across the airport to “identify any similar aircraft taxi-separation hazards”.</p>
      <p>The report added: “The operators of both aircraft also alerted their East Midlands Airport flight crews to the hazard of reduced separation when using stands 20 to 25.</p>
      <p>“The operator of EI-SEV also issued a company notice to alert its pilots.”</p>
      <p>Commenting on the incident following the publication of the AAIB report, an East Midlands Airport spokesman said: “We supported the investigation into the incident on April 30, which involved two aircraft with no passengers on board.</p>
      <p>“Immediately following it, an internal team was assigned to review relevant procedures and changes have been made to our operating procedures that control the movement and parking of aircraft on the apron.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The airport is also looking at how new technology could further improve procedures.”</p>
