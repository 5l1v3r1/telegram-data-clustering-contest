      <p>25-year-old Pasha attacked the former minister with a knife during the wedding. He tried to escape but was captured by people present. It’s, however, not clear what prompted him to attack Sait. A report by <i><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tanveer-sait-attacked-at-a-wedding-undergoes-surgery/article30004090.ece">The Hindu</a> </i>said that Pasha, a local handicraft artisan, was  “disillusioned’’ as he had approached Mr. Sait a couple of times seeking a job and was disappointed over the delay.</p>
      <p>Police are currently interrogating Pasha. Meanwhile, a statement Columbia Asia Hospital, where Sait is undergoing treatment, said that his condition remained critical and he was kept under monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).</p>
