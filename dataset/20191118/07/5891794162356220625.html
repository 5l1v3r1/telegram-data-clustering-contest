      <p>KABUL â€“ At least four Afghan National Army soldiers and one civilian have been wounded in an <a href="https://da.azadiradio.com/a/30277564.html">attack on a military training center</a> in Kabul, officials say.<br/><br/>Defense Ministry spokesman Fuad Aman told RFE/RL that unknown attackers threw two grenades at the gate of the military facility on the western edge of Kabul on November 18.<br/><br/>An Interior Ministry spokesman initially said the two explosions were caused by suicide bombers.<br/><br/>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which comes five days after a suicide car bombing targeted a private security firm's convoy in Kabul, killing 12 people.<br/><br/>Both the Taliban and the Islamic State group frequently target Afghan security forces and government officials in the Afghan capital and elsewhere across the country.<br/><br/>Last week, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/afghanistan-taliban-prisoner-swap-haqqani-delayed/30276137.html"> announced the release</a> of three high-level Taliban prisoners but later had them sent back to custody.<br/><br/>Two professors of the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, U.S. national Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, were to be exchanged for them.<br/><br/>The Taliban kidnapped the academics in 2016.</p>
