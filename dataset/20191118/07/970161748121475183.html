      <p>Piers Morgan has slammed ‘insulting’ university ruling that declares <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/anyone-allowed-identify-black-regardless-skin-colour-11173537/">white people can self-identify as black</a>.</p>
      <p>Both Piers and Susanna put on a united front of Good Morning Britain by refusing to defend the ruling, shunning impartiality rules put in place by Ofcom, to declare the move ‘insulting’.</p>
      <p>The University and Colleges Union has ruled people can identify how they see fit – extending identification beyond gender to include declaring yourself a different race, and even if you’re disabled or not.</p>

      <p>Susanna compared the move to the Rachel Dolezal scandal from the States, where a white woman masqueraded as a black woman and self-identified as black, saying that she was ‘absolutely crucified’ for essentially the same thing.</p>
      <p>Furious Piers declared: ‘This is the way the world’s going! And people think I’m the nutty one, I tell you I’m not.</p>
      <p>‘If you’re white, you’re white, if you’re black, you’re black. That’s it. We don’t need 120,000 lunatic academics to tell us that white people are now black.</p>
      <p>‘It’s insulting and ridiculous. To everybody. It’s mad.’</p>

      <p>Susanna then backed up her co-anchor and refused to defend the ruling that people can identify their own race.</p>
      <p>‘If Ofcom are watching I think I’m supposed to defend them, the university chiefs. But I’m not sure I can in this case,’ Susanna said.</p>
      <p>‘How do they get to be academics, these people?,’ a livid Piers added.</p>
      <p>The Universities and Colleges union stated in their ruling: ‘Our rules commit us to ending all forms of discrimination, bigotry and stereotyping.</p>
      <p>‘UCU has a long history of enabling members to self-identify whether that is being black, disabled, LGBT+ or women.’</p>
