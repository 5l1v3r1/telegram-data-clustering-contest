      <h1>INX Media: ED moves HC seeking rectification of inadvertent error in Chidambaram’s bail order</h1>
      <h2>The ED in its application urged the court to correct the "accidental slip/inadvertent error" that is there in the November 15 verdict passed by Justice Suresh Kait.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:22:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Enforcement Directorate on Monday approached the Delhi High Court seeking rectification of an “inadvertent” error in the order denying bail to former Union finance minister P Chidambaram in the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/chidambaram-inx-media-scam-case-explained-karti-5921402/">INX Media</a> money laundering case.</p>
      <p>The ED in its application urged the court to correct the “accidental slip/inadvertent error” that is there in the November 15 verdict passed by Justice Suresh Kait.</p>
      <p>The facts of another case have found mention in the Delhi High Court order denying bail to Chidambaram.</p>
      <p>The error is there in four paragraphs of the 41-page judgment.</p>
      <p>Justice Kait reproduced some paragraphs from a 2017 Supreme Court order rejecting bail to Delhi-based lawyer Rohit Tandon in a money laundering case.</p>
      <p>The judge also referred to a previous 2017 order of the high court in the case of Tandon versus the ED in which it was observed that “there is a provision of trial by a special courts in case of ‘schedule offences’ under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).</p>
      <p>Possibility of a joint trial would arise under Section 44 of PMLA only when a charge sheet is filed upon completion of investigation and the case is committed to a special court.</p>
