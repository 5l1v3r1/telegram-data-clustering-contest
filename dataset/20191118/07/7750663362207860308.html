      <h1>Raikkonen yet to study new rules for 2021</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kimi-raikkonen/"><b>Kimi Raikkonen</b></a> says he isn't sure he will still be in Formula 1 in 2021.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:14:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:14</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>At 40, the Finn - who has had a disappointing last part of the 2019 season with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/sauber/"><b>Alfa Romeo</b></a> - admitted he never imagined that his F1 career would last so long.</p>
      <p>"Definitely not," he told Brazil's Globo.</p>
      <p>"I spent a few years out of Formula 1 doing rallying and other things, and without that I wouldn't be here for sure. It was nice to do other things for a while.</p>
      <p>"When I started in 2001 I never thought I would still be here in 2019, but that's how it ended up, and that's fine," the 2007 world champion added.</p>
      <p>Raikkonen is all signed up for 2020, but his trainer Mark Arnall admitted at the weekend that the former <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> driver is "frustrated" with his current results.</p>
      <p>But Kimi himself says he is at least still enjoying the driving part of Formula 1.</p>
      <p>"I was never a big fan of the other stuff," he said.</p>
      <p>"Most of the time you are at airports, on planes, travelling. It's good that the year is over, because so much time on planes is boring eventually.</p>
      <p>"Obviously this is the boring part of it, all the interviews and the other things. I'm just interested in driving and racing," Raikkonen added.</p>
      <p>As for 2021, the 40-year-old said he is yet to even look at the new rules for 2021, let alone think about whether he wants to sign a new deal.</p>
      <p>"Honestly I haven't looked at them. People ask me, and I hear people comment, but I haven't seen them (the rules) yet," said Raikkonen.</p>
      <p>"I saw a picture of a car, but it's still a year, a year and a half to go. I don't know if I'll drive one of those cars."</p>
      <p>So with a title, 21 wins and over 100 podiums under his belt, Raikkonen was asked if he has any more goals he wants to achieve in F1.</p>
      <p>"Just to do the best I can. That's all I'm interested in," he said.</p>
