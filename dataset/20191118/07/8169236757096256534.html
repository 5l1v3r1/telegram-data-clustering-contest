        <b>Manchester United and Arsenal have reportedly both been alerted to the fine form of Hartlepool wonderkid Brad Young.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old goalkeeper looks an exciting prospect and his fine recent form has just earned him a call-up for England at youth level.</p>

      <p>This is according to a report from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364285/man-utd-arsenal-hartlepool-brad-young/">Sun</a>, who name Man Utd and Arsenal as two big clubs keeping an eye on the player ahead of a potential transfer swoop.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how much of a priority Young will be for either club, but the report goes on to say Hartlepool won’t necessarily let him go too easily.</p>
      <p>The teenage shot-stopper is said in the report to have only recently signed a professional contract with the National League club.</p>
      <p>Both United and Arsenal have a history of identifying and developing some of the best youth players, and Young may well become the latest to be given that chance at Old Trafford or the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>Neither club is exactly in desperate need of a new ‘keeper right now, but of course Young would be a signing for the future for either team.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see if this promising talent can continue to improve and earn himself a move up to a bigger club in the near future.</p>
