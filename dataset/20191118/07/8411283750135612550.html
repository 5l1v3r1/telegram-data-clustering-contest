      <h1>Smart cloud management services needed to support production globalization</h1>

      <p>Cloud services providers are gaining new business opportunities from the relocation of production lines from China to other parts of the world in the wake of the US-China trade war, as many enterprises have to rely on cloud-based rotary equipment monitoring solutions to manage their plants worldwide and demand for such smart manufacturing solutions will grow significantly in the 5G era, according to Microsoft sources.</p>
      <p>At a recent forum hosted by Microsoft Taiwan with the theme "Factory of the Future," the firm's enterprise commercial lead Sean Pien said that some enterprises have managed to utilize Microsoft Azure cloud service platform to monitor their plants located worldwide to get uniform and timely feedbacks,</p>
      <p>Pien said that IT (information technology) and OT (operation technology) are being combined for the moment, and 5G will accelerate the combination to materialize smart factories, where people, machines, resources and products are intelligently interconnected to allow real-time information exchange and work automatically toward predefined goals.</p>
      <p>Pien stressed that the concepts of "China as the factory of the world" and "the US as the market of the world" were things of the past, and manufacturers will have to get closer to their markets amid globalization of manufacturing.</p>
      <p>He continued that cloud management and data analysis platforms will be increasingly needed by enterprises to enable uniform, customized and real-time feedbacks from their manufacturing plants spread around the world.</p>
      <p>Also speaking at the forum, Digitimes president Colley Hwang said that Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain embraces huge business opportunities from the US-China trade war. Taiwan is also in a good position to host a global unicorn summit, given that the vast majority of 410 unicorns now operating worldwide - 49% in the US and 24% in China - have to rely on Taiwan for hardware production.</p>
