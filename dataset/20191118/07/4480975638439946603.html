      <p>The AUD/USD pair filled a modest weekly bearish gap and is currently placed near Friday's swing high, around the 0.6815-20 region.<br/> <br/>The pair failed to capitalize on the previous session's strong positive move and was off to a cautious start on Monday, shrugging off the incoming positive trade-related headlines. Chinese state media Xinhua said on Sunday the two countries had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday.</p>
      <h3>Focus remains on trade developments</h3>
      <p>This comes on the back of the recent comments by US officials, suggesting that they were close to securing a trade deal with China, albeit did little to impress bullish traders. However, a subdued US Dollar price action, amid a modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields, helped limit any meaningful downside.<br/> <br/>In absence of any fresh catalyst, investors seemed reluctant to place any aggressive bets, rather might prefer to wait for any fresh US-China trade developments before positioning for any firm near-term direction amid absent relevant market-moving economic releases on the first day of a new trading week.</p>
