        <b>A SUPER FIT Scots dad finished fifth at the famously gruelling World's Toughest Mudder – entering just FIVE days before racing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scott Brown, 37, from Irvine smashed 90 miles in 24 continuous hours of energy-sapping competition in America over Saturday and Sunday.</p>

      <p>He finished fifth overall in the world standings, but claimed the number one spot for the top European performance among the hundreds taking part.</p>
      <p>The dad of three had NO endurance training prior to taking part in Atlanta because he was recovering from a knee injury, ruling him out of running for months.</p>
      <p>However, a little bit of adversity is nothing for the Ayrshireman, who trains hard at his gym in Tarbolton.</p>
      <p>He told The Scottish Sun how the decision came about to jump straight into the notoriously intense, ultimate fitness test.</p>
      <p>He said: “It couldn’t have gone better and it was worth every pain I’m feeling now.</p>
      <p>“It was all about who was willing to suffer the most over 24 hours.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of myself and I can’t thank everyone at home enough for getting behind me.</p>
      <p>“I’m glad to put Scotland on the map once more.</p>
      <p>“I only decided to go on Monday (November 11), so wasn’t sure how it would go. It exceeded my expectations.</p>
      <p>“This year I wasn’t going to go at all as I did the West Highland Race in June, which was 97 miles and I finished 7th which I was over the moon with.</p>

      <p>“The next thing I rushed back into running and hurt my knee because I was stupid and didn’t allow myself the proper rest.</p>
      <p>“So I spent about 13 weeks just doing gym work on my upper body.</p>
      <p>"The last five weeks I’ve been injury free.</p>
      <p>“I was looking through Facebook memories on Monday and it came up with pictures from last year.</p>
      <p>“I tore my pec seven hours into the competition but I carried on and finished eighth, which I think was a great result in the circumstances.</p>
      <p>“But I looked through the comments and I messaged my wife Kerri to ask if I could go again, and she said ‘you’re off your head’.</p>
      <p>“She thought the voice of reason would be my running coach Kasey.</p>
      <p>“So I messaged him to say ‘you’re gonna think I’m mad but can I go and do World’s Toughest Mudder, you know I’m pretty good at it’ and he told me to go for it.</p>
      <p>“We knew I wasn’t going to be in great condition for it but I wanted to enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“So I booked the flights, got my gym covered for the weekend and off I went.”</p>
      <p>The gym and fitness bootcamp fanatic managed 18 laps of the five-mile assault course.</p>
      <p>The winner, Trevor Cichosz, from USA, won with 21 laps, completing 105 miles in total.</p>
      <p>However, Scott, who served nine years in the British Army, was amazed by the generosity of one of his competitors.</p>
      <p>He explained: “I usually take friends and family with me but because it was such short notice I couldn’t organise that.</p>

      <p>“Although one of the American athletes, his team helped me out with my pit, which is a small tented area to get changed and to eat.</p>
      <p>“I’ve known him for some time from previous runs, so even although we were rivals for the top places, it was good to have that kind support.”</p>
      <p>Scott runs his gym on a full-time basis, along with his SBF bootcamp in Dundonald some weeknights.</p>
      <p>His social media post about his fantastic news raked up over 1,000 likes on Facebook.</p>
      <p>While he knows to learn from past mistakes, he isn’t ruling out a return to compete for a fifth time next year.</p>
      <p>He said: “I started the race too fast I think – I was flying. I started getting cramps through the lack of training.</p>
      <p>“But it goes past fitness and it’s down to who is willing to suffer the most, and I don’t think I left the top seven spots the full race.</p>
      <p>“I feel physically fine and in good health – just aches and pains.</p>
      <p>“In 2015 I finished fifth as well, 2012 which was my first year, I was tenth and then last year I went and ended eighth.</p>
      <p>“I say I’m not going back every year because it’s in America but I’m not going to think like that this time.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a 214-mile race in June 2020, it’s a race across Scotland, so that takes my next focus.</p>
      <p>“I’ll give my body recover over Christmas first and enjoy some family time with my wife and daughters and then I’ll get back into the swing of things to prepare.”</p>
