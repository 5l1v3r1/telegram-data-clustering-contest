      <p>THE Shire of Murray has unanimously objected to the North Dandalup Research Centre obtaining a liquor license for its proposed restaurant.</p>
      <p>The centre, intended for agricultural research, applied for a license to allow them be able to sell alcohol 365 days a year from 10am to midnight from their North Dandalup Research Centre Tasting Room, creating a tourist venue.</p>
      <p>“A major intention was to establish a tourist venue for scientific tasting of food and beverage from the Peel region,” said C Y O’Connor ERADE village eesearch director Roger Dawkins.</p>
      <p>However, according to the Shire, obtaining the license would result in the restaurant being run as an independent operation rather than being incidental to the research centre, which is required under rural zoning laws.</p>
      <p>“The Shire’s concern is to ensure that the restaurant operates consistent with the planning approval,” a Shire of Murray spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>For the restaurant to be incidental, users of the restaurant must be associated with the research centre whether daily or for an event, it must be run by the same people who run the research centre, opening times need to be consistent with the research centre, food sold in the restaurant must be associated with the activities of the research centre such as beef or lamb, and the restaurant cannot be advertised separately.</p>
      <p>The Shire also raised concerns about the tasting room targeting community members and competing with local business.</p>
      <p>The application is now on hold as the Shire’s issues are addressed.</p>
      <p>“Mr Paul Fitzpatrick of the CYO’Connor Foundation has confirmed that any delay in establishing the tourist centre will have little immediate impact on the development of the research and incubator village in North Dandalup,” Mr Dawekins said.</p>
