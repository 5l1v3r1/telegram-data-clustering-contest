      <p>The same report states that Princess Diana wore it at four important events, the first time during a state visit to Austria in 1986 and later at a night out to the Royal Opera House in 1991. For her portrait by Lord Snowden in 1997, she was seen wearing the same dress. Two months before her death, in June 1997, she auctioned it to raise funds. It was sold off for £100,000 (₹ 92,72,900) to Maureen Dunkel, a businesswoman based out of Florida, who kept it with her till 2011 when she went bankrupt.</p>
      <p>In 2013, it was sold to a British gentleman for £240,000 (₹ 2,22,57,149). Now. after six years, the dress will be sold again with Kerry Taylor Auctions, of London.</p>
      <p>‘This is arguably her most iconic gown, the photos of her being twirled around the dance floor by a handsome John Travolta at the White House caused a sensation at the time, and are still memorable today. Royal protocol required her to dress very demurely; however, this gown is very evocative of ‘old Hollywood glamour’, quite low-cut and falling off the shoulders. It was a bold and mature choice for such a young princess, and she wowed everyone on the night. The estimate reflects Diana’s enduring appeal to private collectors and museums internationally,” Lucy Bishop, of Kerry Taylor Auctions said.</p>
      <p>The sale will take place on December 9.</p>
