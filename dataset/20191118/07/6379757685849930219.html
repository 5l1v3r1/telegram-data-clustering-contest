      <p>NIC Bank Tanzania Limited’s Managing Director, Margaret Karume said in Dar es Salaam last week when addressing students of Loyola Secondary School that they should focus on the global market while undertaking their studies.</p>
      <p>Karume who was chief guest at the 21st graduation ceremony of Loyola School’s form four students, congratulated them for successfully completing their ordinary level education while urging them to aim even higher.</p>
      <p>“In this era of globalization and rapid development of science and technology, you should all be prepared to advance to the next level of education knowing that education is a continuous process that’s geared towards preparing you for a bright future, whether in formal or self-employment,” the NIC boss said.</p>
      <p>She pointed out that education is a life-long process aimed to mould and prepare students not only to get employed but also self-employ themselves. Karume urged the graduating students to not only rely on their teachers in the learning process but also be self-driven with an interest to read books of all types.</p>
      <p>She cherished Loyola’s history of producing quality students who have become highly professional people serving the country in various positions. “This school has a great history of producing experts such as doctors, engineers, academician and specialists in various fields,” the NIC Bank Managing Director added while donating 100 mattresses to the Dar es Salaam based school.</p>
      <p>“As a bank, we are committed to making a positive contribution to the community in which we operate hence the decision to support quality education as part of our corporate social responsibility,” she noted.</p>
      <p>Loyola’s Headmaster, Father Obwando Meyo expressed confidence that all the graduands will pass their examinations with high marks to proceed to form five at advanced level of education prior to heading to universities and colleges.</p>
      <p>“This group of students is highly competitive and we only hope for the best in the performance,” Fr Meyo said. Loyola is a Jesuit, English medium secondary school with 50 percent of the students coming from medium and low-income families, most of who receive grants from non-government organizations to finance their studies.</p>
