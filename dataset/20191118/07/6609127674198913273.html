        <b>B&amp;Q have jokingly told a Rangers fan 'keep us out of it' after he highlighted an 'EBT' product they sell.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scottish football was rocked earlier this week after <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4952016/taxman-50m-blunder-rangers/">The Times reported that Oldco Rangers' final tax bill could be massively reduced</a>.</p>

      <p>HMRC later hit back at those claims and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4956486/rangers-tax-ebt-hmrc/">insisted it had not made any mistakes</a> in how they calculated the company's tax liabilities for its EBT scheme.</p>
      <p>But one <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> fan saw the lighter side of the row earlier as he claimed DIY store B&amp;Q were wading into the debate.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture of cans of Sikaflex EBT sealant on the shop's shelves, he tweeted: "FFS there's B&amp;Q at it now."</p>
      <p>B&amp;Q then joined in with the joke, replying: "Keep us out of it."</p>

      <p>Some fans loved the company's response.</p>
      <p>@Tomtom1872 said: "Too sticky even for B&amp;Q bud."</p>
      <p>@Ben0517_ added: "You should be okay as long as the HMRC staff member isn't a Homebase supporter."</p>
      <p>While @Stuart723 showed his appreciation by tweeting a picture of a box of Quality Street.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rangers star Glen Kamara has admitted <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4963922/glen-kamara-finland-euro-2020-party-rangers-steven-gerrard-message/">he partied all night following Finland's historic Euro 2020 qualification</a>.</p>
      <p>The Finns sparked huge celebrations in their homeland after they swept aside Liechtenstein to qualify for a major tournament for the first time ever.</p>
