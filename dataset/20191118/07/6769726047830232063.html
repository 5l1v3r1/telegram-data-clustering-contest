      <h1>Shire of Murray considers moving Pinjarra War Memorial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Kirby</a></address>
      <p>THE Shire of Murray is considering relocating the Pinjarra War Memorial.</p>
      <p>The proposed location for the war memorial is within Glebe Land adjacent to Edenvale Homestead and St John’s Church.</p>
      <p>Shire of Murray President David Bolt said the new location would provide a more appropriately place to remember those who have served and died in the Defence Force.</p>
      <p>“The concept plan prepared for the proposed site further accommodates growing attendance at Pinjarra ANZAC Day events and addresses safety concerns with respect to the current site’s proximity to Pinjarra Road,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Landscaping will ensure accessibility to the memorial as well as offer improved vantage points, especially for event attendees.”</p>
      <p>The Pinjarra branch of the Returned Services League initiated discussions with the Shire regarding a new site for the memorial, with the League selecting the proposed site as their preferred option.</p>
      <p>Should feedback received support the relocation, stonemasons will be engaged to disassemble the war memorial, undertake off-site restoration works and install the structure in the new location.</p>
      <p>They intend for the relocation works to be completed before ANZAC Day next year.</p>
      <p>“Safety and accessibility concerns need to be addressed to ensure the community have a befitting space to honour the selfless sacrifice of our servicemen and women,” Mr Bolt said.</p>
      <p>The Pinjarra War Memorial was initially installed in Cantwell Park (formally Pinjarra Park) and unveiled by then Governor of Western Australia Sir Francis Newdegate in July 1923.</p>
      <p>In 1966 the memorial was relocated to its current location in the grounds of the Pinjarra Civic Centre.</p>

      <p>Submissions close Tuesday, November 26.</p>
