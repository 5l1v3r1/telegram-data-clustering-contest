      <p>A man has been arrested after more than 1,000 people descended on a disused Carpetright warehouse store for an illegal rave.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the premises in Strood Retail Park, Kent, at 11.30pm on Saturday, following reports of anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>Up to 10 police vehicles were spotted outside, and officers remained on-site to prevent any ‘potential breach of peace’ throughout the evening.</p>
      <p>A video circulating on social media showed huge crowds dancing inside the rave, which had been kitted out with professional sound and lights systems.</p>

      <p>One person can be heard saying in the clip: ‘We’ve finished work, gone to McDonald’s in Strood and hear about this illegal rave at Carpetright – this is crazy.’</p>
