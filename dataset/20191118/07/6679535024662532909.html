      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:48:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-P-Saravanan-883/" target="_blank">S.P. Saravanan</a></address>
      <p>Minister for Electricity, Prohibition and Excise, P. Thangamani has said that the State government had no intention of affecting farmers and that farmers opposing the erection of high tension electric towers were doing it for political reasons.</p>
      <p>The Minister, along with officials, on Monday, inspected the portion of the approach road to the barrage-cum-bridge in Pasur where restoration work is being carried out, after it caved in on November 13</p>
      <p>Addressing media persons, he said that a false campaign is being disseminated which says that if towers are erected on farm lands, farming activities will not be able to be carried out. “Farming can be done”, he said and added that 100% compensation is given to the farmer for erection of towers and 20% compensation is given if HT lines pass through the land.</p>
      <p>When asked about statements issued by farmers affected by high tension power line projects in 13 districts saying that they were not invited for talks so far by the government, Mr. Thangamani said that this was wrong information and that 10 rounds of talks were held with the farmers.</p>
      <p>“Based on the request placed by the farmers in meetings, compensation for coconut trees and land has been fixed and a new government order has been issued”, he said. The Minister said that the protesting farmers are doing it for political reasons and added that true farmers were meeting Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday to thank him.</p>
      <p>On CPI State Secretary R. Mutharasan’s claim that towers were installed on non-farm lands in Kerala, the minister said that towers were installed in paddy fields and claimed that he had proof of this.</p>
