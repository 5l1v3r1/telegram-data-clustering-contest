      <h1>Gasly showed 'class' and 'talent' in Brazil - Marko</h1>
      <h2>A podium in Brazil is "proof" that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pierre-gasly/"><b>Pierre Gasly</b></a> is a talented Formula 1 driver.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:15:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>That is the view of Dr <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/helmut-marko/"><b>Helmut Marko</b></a>, even though <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/"><b>Red Bull</b></a>'s notoriously harsh driver manager demoted the Frenchman earlier this season.</p>
      <p>But Gasly has been strong since he returned from the senior team to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/toro-rosso/"><b>Toro Rosso</b></a>, and on Sunday he drove through the late crashes at Interlagos to finish second.</p>
      <p>"Pierre showed his class here," Marko told France's Canal Plus.</p>
      <p>"We know he has talent and today is good proof of that. Nobody saw it coming. It is a fantastic result.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is happy for him and we will certainly celebrate," he added.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/max-verstappen/"><b>Max Verstappen</b></a> - Gasly's former teammate - won the race for Red Bull Racing, making it the first Honda-powered 1-2 for decades.</p>
      <p>"I always knew he was a very quick driver," the Dutchman, referring to Gasly, said.</p>
      <p>Verstappen will however continue to be paired with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-albon/"><b>Alex Albon</b></a> in 2020.</p>
      <p>"I think this year in the beginning maybe didn't work out the way it should for Pierre, but as you can see, I think he is very strong," he added.</p>
      <p>"He has regrouped at Toro Rosso and even before this race he has done a lot of good results. So this is an even bigger motivation," Verstappen added.</p>
