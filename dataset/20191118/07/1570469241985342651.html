      <p>China, during defence talks in Bangkok on Monday, called on the US military to stop flexing its muscles in the <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/china-says-ready-to-work-with-asean-for-south-china-sea-peace-259624">South China Sea</a> and to avoid adding "new uncertainties" over Taiwan, underscoring tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>
      <p>Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe called on US Defense Secretary Mark Esper to "stop flexing muscles in the South China Sea and to not provoke and escalate tensions in the South China Sea," said Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian.</p>
      <p>The United States did not immediately respond but has accused China of militarising the South China Sea. Esper said on Sunday Beijing was "increasingly resorting to <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/us-warship-sails-in-disputed-south-china-sea-amid-trade-tensions-246250">coercion and intimidation</a> to advance its strategic objectives" in the region.</p>
      <p>During closed-door talks on the sidelines of a gathering of defence ministers in Bangkok, Wei urged Esper to "stop flexing muscles in the South China Sea and to not provoke and escalate tensions in the South China Sea," the spokesman, Wu Qian, said.</p>
      <p>China claims almost all the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea, where it has established military outposts on artificial islands. However, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the sea.</p>
      <p>The United States accuses China of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to exploit trillion of dollars worth of oil and gas reserves.</p>
      <p>The US Navy regularly vexes China by conducting what it calls "freedom of navigation" operations by ships close to islands China occupies in the South China Sea.</p>
      <p>Asked specifically what Wei sought for the United States to do differently, and whether that included halting such freedom of navigation operations, Wu said: "We (call on) the US side to stop intervening in the South China Sea and stop military provocation in the South China Sea."</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite warm words exchanged in front of reporters, Wei and Esper also discussed the thorny issue of Taiwan, which is claimed by China as a wayward province and is the Communist Party's most sensitive and important territorial issue.</p>
      <p>Fenghe underscored to Esper China's position that it would "not tolerate any Taiwan independence incident," Wu said, adding that it opposed any official or military contact with Taiwan.</p>
      <p>China has in the past threatened to attack if Taiwan, set to hold a presidential election next year, moves towards independence.</p>
      <p>"The Chinese side also requires the US side to carefully handle the Taiwan related-issue and to not add new uncertainties to the Strait," Wu said.</p>
      <p>The exchange came a day after news that China sailed a carrier group into the sensitive Taiwan Strait, led by its first domestically built aircraft carrier.</p>
