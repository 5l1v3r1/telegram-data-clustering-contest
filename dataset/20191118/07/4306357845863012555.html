      <h2>Owen Hargreaves discusses Chelsea FC's hopes of being in the title race this season</h2>

      <h3>Owen Hargreaves believes that Chelsea FC can place themselves firmly in the Premier League title race if they can improve their defending.</h3>
      <p>The Blues currently find themselves in third place in the Premier League table after a brilliant recent run of form under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC have won their last six games in the Premier League to leave them in third place and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Lampard has been earning lots of praise for the way he has been placing his faith in Chelsea FC’s young players this season.</p>
      <p>The west London side were 2-0 winners against Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge in their most recent Premier League outing.</p>
      <p>And former Manchester United midfielder Hargreaves feels that the Blues are not too far off being considered genuine contenders for the Premier League title.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>BT Sport</i> after the 2-0 win over Palace, Hargreaves said: “They [Chelsea FC] are quietly chipping away and that’s what you want.</p>
      <p>“Nobody knew before the season that this many young players would play.</p>
      <p>“They are flying right now under Frank. He’s making all the right decisions. The only thing for Frank is that they’ve conceded as many goals as Newcastle.</p>
      <p>“Offensively, they’re outrageously good. If they can just tidy up the defensive part, they’ll be there in the title race.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC – who finished third last season – will return to Premier League action next weekend with a crunch clash against Manchester City at The Etihad.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s men will be looking to bounce back to winning ways after the disappointment of their 3-1 loss to Liverpool FC at Anfield last time out.</p>
