      <p>No fewer than 302 residents of Akpoha community in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State have benefitted from the Nigerian Army free medical outreach.</p>
      <p>The medical outreach is part of the ongoing Exercise Atilogwu Udo 1, which is locally known as Dance of Peace.</p>
      <p>Colonel Aliyu Yusuf, Deputy Director Army Public Relations 82 Division of the Nigerian Army, said in a statement on Sunday in Enugu that the “comprehensive free medical programme’’ took place on Saturday in Akpoha community.</p>
      <p>Yusuf noted that the medical exercise was part of Civil-Military-Cooperation in line with activities for Exercise Atilogwu Udo 1 meant to offer humanitarian services to the public and host community.</p>
      <p>“The medical outreach is also in line with the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Burutai, vision to cater for the welfare of the host community,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to him, the Nigerian Army through the Division mobilised scores of medical and paramedic personnel to execute the successful medical outreach.</p>
      <p>Yusuf said the medical professionals at the venue offered health talk and counselling to the people one-on-one.</p>
      <p>He said they also conducted blood pressure, sugar and eye defect tests as well as distribution of free medicine, de-worming medicines for children and provision of eye-glasses.</p>
      <p>“The medical outreach activities provided usual platform to further strengthen the long standing Civil Military Relations between the Army and its civil populace,” he said.</p>
      <p>Exercise Atilogwu Udo 1 is meant to be used to carry out community services within the Division’s Area of Responsibility.</p>
      <p>These services included: sanitation, medical outreaches, clearing of drains, road construction, educational support and other social works.</p>
