      <p>Keen to have a baby in their lives, Akshay and Bebo go to great lengths in their bedroom and seek medical help too. Their amazing couple camaraderie is to die for and we cannot wait for Christmas to arrive! During their quest for a baby, the couple bumps into another eager-to-be-parents duo <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kiara-Advani">Kiara Advani</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Diljit-Dosanjh">Diljit Dosanjh</a>. While she is a hands-on mother in real life, Bebo gives an interesting glimpse of pregnancy on the silver screen. ‘Good Newwz’ talks about how a married couple, the Batras - Akshay and Kareena who go for IVF treatment and bump into another Batras - Kiara and Diljit, who are also trying to have a baby. Tagged as the ‘biggest goof-up of the year’, Akshay and Diljit’s sperms are mixed and thus ensues a hilarious ride packed with drama, emotions and a lot of laughter.</p>
      <p>Directed by Raj Mehta, the film went on floors in November last year. ‘Good Newwz’ is scheduled to hit the screens on December 27. ‘Good Newwz’ is arriving a week after Salman Khan’s much-awaited cop drama ‘Dabangg 3’.</p>
