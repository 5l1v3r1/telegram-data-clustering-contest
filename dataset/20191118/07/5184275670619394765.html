      <p>When asked if leaving the franchise was bittersweet, he said: “Yeah, 100 per cent, because you no longer have the consistency with these people who you have genuine friendships with.”</p>
      <p>However, Boyega is pleased that his character has maintained a sense of “mystery”.</p>
      <p>He added: “It feels OK, because, with just three films, there’s still a curiosity and a mystery about Finn. There are still certain things that I really don’t know about him. It feels like, ‘OK, cool. It’s a balanced, right time.’</p>
      <p>“But if my name was Daniel Radcliffe right now, I’d be like, ‘I’ll be playing this guy for years. Yeah! Somebody take this wand!’ “</p>
