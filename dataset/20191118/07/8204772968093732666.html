      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Greencoat+Renewables">Greencoat Renewables</a> has acquired the 20.4 MW Killala community wind farm in Co Mayo for an initial €37.2 million.</p>
      <p>The project consists of five <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Siemens">Siemens</a> 3.4MW turbines that have been operational since July. An additional Siemens 3.4MW turbine is currently under construction which will bring the installed capacity to 20.4MW by late 2020.</p>
      <p>Construction of the additional turbine is being overseen by the existing developers and Siemens will continue to manage the wind farm’s contract.</p>
      <p>The acquisition is being funded by the company’s €380 million credit facility.</p>
      <p>Following the acquisition, Greencoat Renewables total borrowings are 47 per cent of gross asset value, it said.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to announce the acquisition of Killala, adding another high-quality wind asset with long-term contracted revenues. This is our first acquisition of a community windfarm and we are delighted that the local community will be sharing in the value created,” said investment manager Paul O’Donnell.</p>
