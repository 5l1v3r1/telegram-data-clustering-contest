      <h1>Joe Gomez injury latest: Reds believe England star will not be out for too long despite knee injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:24:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Joe Gomez missed England’s comfortable win over Kosovo last night through injury, having been sent back to Merseyside having picked up a knee issue sustained in training when he clashed knees with Kieran Trippier.</p>
      <p>It was a concern to hear that, especially given some of his problems with injuries and knocks in the past, however, the latest update on the centre-back sounds promising.</p>
      <p>According to the Daily Mail’s <a href="https://twitter.com/DominicKing_DM/status/1195795853711233025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Freadliverpoolfc.com%2F2019%2F11%2F18%2Fgomez-suffers-swollen-knee-on-international-duty%2F">Dominic King</a>, Gomez has had a scan on the injury and does not believe it is too serious. The area is slightly swollen but it is not expected to keep him out of action for too long.</p>
      <p>With a number of matches coming up, and with Joel Matip already out with an injury of his own, it will be important that the Reds keep as many players fit as possible.</p>
      <p>Gomez, who was incredibly booed by England fans against Montenegro for his part in the Raheem Sterling incident, has not featured a great deal for the Reds so far this season, but as long as the injury is not too serious, can expect a good number of minutes over the next few weeks.</p>
