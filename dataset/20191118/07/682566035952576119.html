      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> midfielder <b>Lebogang Phiri</b> said he needs to build on his performance after scoring the match-winning goal in a <b>1-0</b> win over <b>Sudan</b> in an <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The win saw South Africa clinch a vital win after a defeat to Ghana in their opening fixture on November 14 in the Cape Coast.</p>
      <p>After two rounds of fixtures, Bafana Bafana now sit in third position in Group C on three points while Sunday's opponents top the group on goal difference.</p>
      <p>Phiri said after the final whistle that he needs to now work harder and build on his performance against Sudan that saw him chosen as the Man of the Match.</p>
      <p>"I've always awaited my chance and the day came," Phiri said. "I did my best and fortunately got us the goal that got us the win which is important.</p>
      <p>"It's something to build on and to just keep moving forward. For me each and every performance is of importance especially in the national team because we get four or five call-ups per year," Phiri added.</p>
      <p>"So at club level that's where you find your form and when you're with the national team it's just about building on your performances to ensure that you give your best.</p>
      <p>"Whether I', selected or not I know I can give it my all when I'm playing."</p>
