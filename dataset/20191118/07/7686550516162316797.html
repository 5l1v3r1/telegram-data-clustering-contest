      <h2>They were bored of the 9-5</h2>

      <p>A couple bored of the “9-5 working life rut” quit their jobs and sold their £350,000 family home to travel the world with their young kids.</p>
      <p>Stock market trader Andre Baldeo, 45, thought he happy and healthy but realised he was simply "going through the motions" rather than living life to the full.</p>
      <p>In a bid to show kids , Rico, 12, and Tiana-Mae, ten, there was "more to life than suburbia", he convinced wife Becky, 44, to uproot the entire family and go wandering.</p>
      <p>They both quit their jobs, sold their belongings and bought a one-way ticket for an 18-month trip of a lifetime.</p>

      <p>They travelled 51,000 miles across 13 countries in South America and Asia, visiting 48 cities, staying in hotels, youth hostels and jungle lodges.</p>
      <p>The family spent Christmas in Tokyo, hiked the Andes, walked up volcanoes, and explored the Amazon forest.</p>
      <p>They swapped days at school and work for stints conserving turtles, working on farms and even football coaching, 'home-schooling' the kids along the way.</p>
      <p>Now back home they are unemployed and living in rented accommodation - but said the £65,000 trip was worth every penny.</p>
      <p>Andre, from Enfield, north London, said: “It was time for a change and I rehashed one of my life long dreams to Becky - to travel the world and experience as much as we could as a family of four.</p>

      <p>“It really hit home how we have to make the most of our lives.</p>
      <p>“Working long hours stuck in front of six monitor screens, studying graphs and looking at news can become very lonely and extremely depressing.</p>
      <p>"It became suffocating.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“We needed a change and needed to do something different.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to show our children there is more to life outside of suburbia.</p>

      <p>“It was completely life-changing and incredibly inspiring but it was the scariest thing I’ve ever had to do.</p>
      <p>“We broke down all the security we had at home and literally gave up everything.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“I do feel proud to have done it and it is the best £65,000 I have ever spent.</p>
      <p>“We now have the most amazing memories to keep forever and nothing will change that.</p>
      <p>“I gave up our family home and I don’t regret it for a second.</p>

      <p>“It was the trip of a lifetime and coming back home has been very strange. It’s going to take a while for us to get used to normal life again.</p>
      <p>”I know when on my deathbed,I’ll have a head full of amazing experiences and memories and won’t have any regrets to what we sacrificed to make them happen."</p>
      <p>Andre lived and worked in London as a trader for nine years, where he met South African native, Becky, a PA.</p>

      <p>They moved to Cape Town together in 2007, had Rico and Tiana-Mae, and lived a comfortable life, with Andre earning around £35,000 a year.</p>
      <p>But in September 2016, Andre said he realised he was getting tired of “going through the motions”.</p>

      <p>He felt as though his family were in a “9-5 working life rut” and wanted to find a way of “broadening horizons” for his kids so they could “learn from the world around them”.</p>
      <p>But he finally made a decision to change his life when he heard a close friend in the UK who had a brain tumour had been given a matter of weeks to live.</p>

      <p>During 18 months of planning they sold their Cape Town home and put all their belongings into storage.</p>
      <p>Andre said they had no idea how long the trip would last for but boarded a one-way flight to Sarawak, in Borneo, in April 2018.</p>

      <p>The family stayed in jungle lodges and bamboo lodges as they set their sights towards Malaysia and the Philippines - climbing the 4,100m tall Mount Kinabalu along the way.</p>
      <p>They did turtle conservation work and volunteered in animal sanctuaries.</p>
      <p>Andre said they planned their route as they went along, and next up was Thailand, Vietnam and Japan.</p>

      <p>“Another volunteering opportunity arose in Japan, this time for me to dust of my boots and help coaching football at an academy”, said Andre.</p>
      <p>“We lived with a Japanese family who had three small children.</p>

      <p>"Food and board was provided in exchange for our help - me coaching football, and Becky helping around the house.</p>
      <p>“Christmas was spent in Tokyo with an old friend of mine and his family, from my home town Enfield, North London.”</p>
      <p>In February the family flew to Colombia and spent five weeks working at a foundation with local children.</p>

      <p>After two months they flew to Ecuador for three weeks walking up volcanoes, exploring the Amazon and hiking in the Andes.</p>
      <p>The last leg of the journey took the Baldeo’s down the eastern side of South America with visits to Peru, Bolivia and Chile.</p>
      <p>Andre said the highlights of South America were a three day, 40km hike in the Andes mountains to Lake Quilotoa, in Ecuador, and visiting Machu Picchu.</p>

      <p>Their last calling point was San Jose, in Costa Rica, where they boarded a plane back home, arriving back in Cape Town on October 29.</p>
      <p>He said it was the best experience of his life - but admits it wasn't always easy.</p>
      <p>He said: “A lot of people think that this way of life is glamorous and essentially a glorified holiday.</p>
      <p>“It is very difficult being together, just the four of us 24/7. No one gets any personal space at all.</p>

      <p>“My guilty pleasure when we packed our rucksacks to come away was my running shoes, so thankfully I got away for some time alone a few times a week.</p>
      <p>“Becky’s guilty pleasure was her hair straighteners - but she has only used them once.</p>
      <p>“To be honest living out of bags, having cold showers, long bus journeys and constantly moving and not having familiar surroundings got draining.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“But the amazing experiences that we had cancel out the negatives.</p>
      <p>“We realised we were coming towards the end after about a year and four months.</p>
      <p>"We were getting very tired and planned out way back home.”</p>

      <p>The family are now renting a fully-furnished family home while they get back on their feet.</p>
      <p>Rico and Tiana-Mae will start back at school in a few weeks time.</p>

      <p>“It already feels like a distant dream but we have a different outlook on life now and we are all better people for it”, said Andre.</p>
      <p>“We met some incredibly poor people and we have taken so many life lessons out of it."</p>
