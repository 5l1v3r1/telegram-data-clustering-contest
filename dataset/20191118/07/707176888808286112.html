      <h2>Moscow keen to ensure technology company remains Russian amid concern over data</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:29:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:29</time> by <a rel="author">Max Seddon</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/5e0a792f-7422-4e01-99b9-6bd26686c80f">Yandex</a>, Russia’s largest technology company, has agreed with the Kremlin to restructure its goverance by transferring a “golden share” to a foundation with expanded veto power.</p>
      <p>Arkady Volozh, Yandex’s founder and chief executive, said in an email to employees on Monday that the company would create a Public Interest Foundation that will have the power to block several key transactions and temporarily remove Yandex’s management if it deems it in the national interest.</p>
      <p>The mechanism is the result of lengthy negotiations with the Kremlin about how to ensure Yandex remains a Russian company while still allowing it to operate independently on global markets, people involved in the talks told the Financial Times. The Kremlin is concerned that the huge amount of user data that Yandex controls in businesses from search and mobile advertising to taxis and food delivery could fall into foreign hands, the people said.</p>
      <p>The move sees the foundation take the “golden share” from state-run Sberbank, which has held it since 2009, and gives it deeper control over Yandex. Mr Volozh, who is also Yandex’s largest shareholder, said he would retain ultimate control over the company’s operations.</p>
      <p>“The internet today is like electricity 100 years ago. Yandex’s products are an essential part of people’s lives and, if something happens to them, it’s not just a problem for the company, but for all of society,” he said in the email.</p>
      <p>“We needed to find a decision that would satisfy three sides by keeping management in our hands, reassuring foreign investors about Yandex’s business potential, and defending national interests.”</p>
      <p>The non-governmental foundation is modelled after a Dutch <i>stichting</i>, an ownerless special-purpose vehicle often used to separate ownership from control and protect assets from hostile takeovers. Its board is made up of representatives from five Russian universities, three Russian non-governmental organisations, and three top Yandex executives.</p>
      <p>Yandex executives will pitch US market investors, who own most of its free float, on the idea this week ahead of a vote at an extraordinary meeting on December 20.</p>
