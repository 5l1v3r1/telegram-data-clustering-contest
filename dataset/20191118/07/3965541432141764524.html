      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (<a href="https://kutv.com/news/local/secret-sister-online-gift-exchanges-are-a-scam-bbb-warns">KUTV</a>) -- It's almost that time of year to buy gifts for "Secret Santa."</p>
      <p>But, beware of secret sister gift exchanges with friends you haven't met.</p>
      <p>These gift exchanges may seem like innocent fun, but they are really pyramid schemes, according to the<a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/18854-bbb-warning-secret-sister-gift-exchange-is-illegal"> Better Business Bureau.</a></p>
      <p>The "Secret Sister" gift exchange became popular in 2015 through posts on Facebook. Participants were promised up to 36 gifts, in exchange for a single gift, valued at $10.</p>
      <p>Users were encouraged to invite others to participate in the holiday gift exchange and promised information on where to send the gifts.</p>
      <p>The cycle continued and participants were left buying and shipping gifts, in the hopes of the favor being reciprocated. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen, according to the BBB.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.uspis.gov/news/scam-article/pyramid-schemes/"> U.S. Postal Inspection Services </a>says these gift exchanges are considered a form of gambling and that participants could be subject to penalties such as jail time, fines or a lawsuit for mail fraud.</p>

      <p>Signing up for the schemes can also expose participants to future scams and identity theft.</p>
      <p>Pyramid schemes are illegal in the United States and Canada.</p>
      <p>The BBB recommends you do the following to stay clear of the pyramid schemes and scams:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ignore it</li>
        <li>Report social media posts</li>
        <li>Never give your personal information to strangers</li>
        <li>Be wary of false claims</li>
      </ul>
