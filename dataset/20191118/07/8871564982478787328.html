      <h1>Loco for burritos and tacos? Seek therapy at Singapore’s newest Mexican joint</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:56:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Love Mexican food but don’t want to compromise your diet? There’s a new fast food joint in town that fits the bill.</p>
      <p>Mad Mex, located in the swanky Marina Bay Financial Center Tower 3, offers customers a choice of burritos, naked burritos, tacos, nachos, quesadillas, ensaladas and something called the Grande Melt, which is basically a wrap with a fajita inside.</p>
      <p>The restaurant follows a “no pork, no lard” rule. But there’s still a variety of protein options including chicken, Veracruz tofu, chorizo chicken and beef barbacoa (extra S$0.50). </p>
      <p>Prices range from S$8.90 for small burritos to S$12.50 for regular nachos or the Grande Melt.</p>

      <p>Why is there a S$0.50 charge for beef barbacoa? That’s because it takes extra time and effort to prepare.</p>
      <p>According to Mad Mex, the beef barbacoa is slow-cooked over a low fire for eight hours until all the flesh is broken down, resulting in smooth and luscious mouthfuls of meat.</p>
      <p>Vegetarians need fret not, as the flavorful Veracruz Tofu is made with tasty olives and parsley (making it actually more Mediterranean than Mexican).</p>
      <p>Spice up meals at Mad Mex further with sauces tuned to tolerance levels – from mild Roasted Tomato Salsa and Salsa Verde to the sizzling Spicy Picante Habanero. Each sauce is made with chilies imported from Mexico.</p>
      <p>Mad Mex’s Singapore opening comes a year after Singapore fast-food chain 4fingers bought a 50% stake in the Australian chain. It is also setting its eyes on more outlets in Singapore as well as across the border in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>It is already a household name in Australia and New Zealand, where it has 70 outlets.</p>
