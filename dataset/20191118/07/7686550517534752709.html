      <p>Prince Andrew is reportedly pleased with his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis despite the considerable negative publicity since it aired.</p>
      <p>The interview has been described as "nuclear explosion level bad" as Andrew defended his relationship with convicted sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who was facing sex trafficking charges when he died in prison.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-newsnight-17269102">often rambling series of statements</a>, Prince Andrew offered his presence at a Pizza Express in Woking and a medical condition that meant he couldn't sweat as proof that claims being made against him were false.</p>
      <p>He cast doubts on the veracity of a photograph appearing to show him with his arm around the waist of one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, by saying he no recollection of it being taken, that he does not give public displays of affection in public and wears certain clothes while out in London.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Maitlis has given her own account of the interview, saying she realised the Queen had given her approval for the "disastrous" interview that aired on the BBC on Saturday night. But other reports say that the Queen only found out about the interview after it had been set up.</p>
      <p>Unconfirmed reports say Andrew told the Queen the interview went “pretty well”, and he had been so pleased with how it had gone <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrew-stands-by-car-crash-tv-interview-2lsn50k03">he gave the Newsnight team a tour of the Palace afterwards</a>.</p>
      <p>But now Buckingham Palace are trying to deal with the backlash, which include observations that Prince Andrew did not once express sympathy for the victims of the convicted sex offender he once knew.</p>
      <p>The BBC has reported sources close to the duke as saying he stands by his decision to talk about his relationship with the disgraced financier. Conflicting reports in the newspapers, also based on sources, claim Andrew told the Queen his television appearance on BBC's Newsnight programme was a success, while another says he expressed regret to friends at not mentioning sympathy for the women trafficked for sex by Epstein.</p>

      <p>The interview has been widely criticised with Royal commentators questioning his responses and condemning his unsympathetic tone and lack of remorse. The former palace press spokesman Dickie Arbiter described the interview as excruciating. The interview, he said, was “not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry crash”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Who made the decision to put him on? My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice. Any sensible-thinking person in the PR business would have thrown their hands up in horror.”</p>
      <p>Charlie Proctor, editor of the Royal Central website, tweeted: “I expected a train wreck. That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.”</p>
      <p>Royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith said: “The interview was awful: defensive, unsteady and weirdly stilted. Andrew seems to have had a judgment bypass... I think his statements put him in greater legal jeopardy, and there will be more pressure for him to testify under oath.”</p>
      <p>Writing in the Times newspaper, interviewer Maitlis described the final stages of securing the royal on the current affairs programme.</p>
      <p>She writes: "We have finished laying out our pitch. An awkward moment of silence falls. And the duke tells us he must 'seek approval from higher up'. It dawns on us then that he means the Queen herself. At 8am the next day we have a message telling us to call his office. The Queen, it seems, is on board."</p>
      <p>Lawyers for some of the 16 women who say they were abused by Epstein have called on Andrew to make a statement to the FBI, still investigating Epstein despite his suicide in jail this summer while facing sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Andrew was asked in the interview if he would give a statement under oath to investigators, and said "if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so, then I would be duty bound to do so".</p>
      <p>Lisa Bloom, who is representing a number of the women, told Sky News: "My clients are very disturbed by all of those who were around Jeffrey Epstein who don't seem to get it, even now.</p>
      <p>"Even now that dozens and dozens of women have come forward and told these horrific stories. Here was the chance for Prince Andrew to say 'my heart goes out to the women, I am so embarrassed and upset that I was ever associated with this monster'.</p>
      <p>"Instead what we hear is he thinks it was honourable to go to his home after his sex crimes conviction and spend four days there because Jeffrey Epstein could introduce him to people, that makes no sense at all. He doesn't seem to have any compassion for the victims, he doesn't seem to have much remorse for his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew twice stated his relationship with Epstein had provided "seriously beneficial outcomes", giving him the opportunity to meet people and prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>He cast doubt on the authenticity of a picture that appears to show Andrew with his arm around the waist of Mrs Giuffre when she was a teenager. The royal said: "From the investigations that we've done, you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph. So it's very difficult to be able to prove it but I don't remember that photograph ever being taken."</p>
      <p>He expressed regret at making contact with Epstein in 2010 - flying to New York to say in person the friendship was over - after the 66-year-old had been released from an 18-month prison term for prostituting minors, saying he did so because he was "too honourable".</p>
      <p>But Maitlis highlighted how he spent a number of days with him at his home, and how he was guest of honour at a dinner party she said celebrated Epstein's release.</p>

      <p>Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that in the wake of the interview, Andrew could find himself out of the core royal family, if reports are correct that the monarchy will be slimmed down when the Prince of Wales becomes king.</p>
      <p>Public relations and crisis consultant Mark Borkowski said about the interview: "I have never seen anything so disastrous. For any students of PR that is how not to do it. It was like watching a man in quick sand and unfortunately, I don't think anyone would have thrown him a line to get him out."</p>
