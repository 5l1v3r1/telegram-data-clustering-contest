      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A poll shows incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has extended her lead over the Kuomintang's (KMT) Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) to 16 percentage points, following her announcement of William Lai (賴清德) as running mate on Sunday (Nov. 17)</p>
      <p>Tsai-Lai is considered to be a dream ticket in the eyes of the pan-green camp. Lai has shown a high level of public support in several polls and is backed by a large number of swing voters, despite losing the party primary in June.</p>
      <p>According to<a href="https://udn.com/vote2020/story/12702/4171310?from=udn_ch2_menu_main"> the latest UDN poll</a>, the Tsai-Lai ticket was favored by 45 percent of respondents to 29 percent for Han-Chang, followed by 8 percent for the People's First Party's (PFP) Soong-Yu ticket. Meanwhile, 18 percent of respondents were undecided, fewer than in <a href="https://udn.com/vote2020/poll">the October survey</a>.</p>
      <p>Tsai has widened the lead from the previous poll dated Oct. 28 (42%: 30%).</p>
      <p>When asked about their favored party for at-large legislative seats, both the KMT and DPP were favored by 29 percent of respondents, each, followed by 8 percent for the newly-formed and Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je-led (柯文哲) Taiwan People's Party (TPP), and 4 percent for the PFP, plus 3 percent for the New Power Party.</p>
      <p>On Jan. 11, 2019, voters will cast ballots for a presidential ticket, a candidate for a local legislative seat, and a political party list of at-large legislative candidates decided by proportional representation.</p>
      <p>UDN conducted the phone survey, interviewing adults over the age of 20 across the country between Nov. 14 and Nov. 16. The survey gathered 1,150 valid samples, with a sampling error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, and a confidence level of 95 percent.</p>
