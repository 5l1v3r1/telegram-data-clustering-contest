        <b>Adelani Adepegba, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Police Service Commission has said armed men overwhelmed security agents during the Saturday governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.</p>
      <p>The commission called on the leadership of the security agencies to immediately take steps to mop up illegal firearms to safeguard the nation’s democracy.</p>
      <p>The PSC spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, in a statement on Sunday expressed satisfaction with the roles played by the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies in the elections.</p>
      <p>It said the interim report of the commission indicated that the police were very professional despite numerous challenges in the two states.</p>
      <p>The PSC said, “The strong monitoring team of the commission to the two states observed the proliferation of illegal weapons, inadequate logistics and challenging terrains as militating factors.</p>
      <p>“The commission monitored the conduct of police officers on election duties in Bayelsa and Kogi states on Saturday, November 16th, 2019, and observed that the police were professional in their conduct during the elections, while the activities of illegal armed men overstretched the capacity of these officers to protect the voters and the electoral materials.”</p>
