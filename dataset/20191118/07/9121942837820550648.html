      <p>LONDON (AP) — The IOC has signed home-sharing company Airbnb to a sponsorship deal that will run from next year’s Tokyo Olympics through the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>
      <p>The Olympic leadership, however, will not be swapping its luxury hotels for rental accommodation.</p>
      <p>International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach says “it will be very difficult” to organize meetings “if we would be in very difficult locations.”</p>
      <p>Bach, speaking at a news conference in London, adds “we are there at the games not to watch like tourists. We are there to organize the games.”</p>
      <p>The IOC is pledging to make at least $28 million worth of Airbnb accommodation available to athletes at the Olympics and Paralympics.</p>
