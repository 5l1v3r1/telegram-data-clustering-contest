      <h1>Sources: US to extend license for its companies to continue business with Huawei - Reuters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:22:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Reuters quoted two sources familiar with the deliberations on Saturday, the US administration is set to issue a two-week extension of a license allowing US companies to continue doing business with China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.</p>
      <p>A source said: “The extension of around two weeks is far shorter than the prior 90-day extension and a longer extension is in the works but has not yet been finalized due to regulatory hurdles.”</p>
      <p>The sources added that the extension will be announced on Monday, when the earlier reprieve is set to expire.</p>
      <p>The Asian trading this Monday sees cautious optimism amid hopes of a US-China trade deal and rife Hong Kong civil tensions. USD/JPY caught a fresh bid-wave and jumped to fresh highs at 108.86 but a break above the 109 level still remains elusive. The Asian stocks turned positive, except for Australian and New Zealand equity markets, as Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rebounded.</p>
