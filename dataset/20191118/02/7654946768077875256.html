      <p>A pup-friendly East Village eatery has a bone to pick with the city Health Department.</p>
      <p>The restaurant, Boris &amp; Horton, says that in yet another example of city regulations-gone-wild, it now can’t even display a menu in its animal-accommodating section, much less allow customers to order food from a waitress there.</p>
      <p>Patrons still aren’t allowed to be served food or pick up their vitals in the pet-friendly section, but it was previously OK to at least order from a waitress with an iPad.</p>
      <p>They can still order from their phones.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit ridiculous,’’ Liam Steele, 31, who was on the non-pet side of the eatery Sunday, said of the new edict.</p>
      <p>Coppy Holzman, founder of the cafe on Avenue A at East 12th Street, was harsher.</p>
      <p>“It’s arbitrary, it’s contrived,’’ he said of the reg. DOH “can’t point to us where there’s a rule that we’re violating. It’s completely arbitrary, it’s completely inconvenient to our customers.”</p>
      <p>A Health Department told The Post on Sunday that the agency must ensure that “food-service establishments are preparing and serving food in a safe and hygienic manner.</p>
      <p>“Some entrepreneurs have created animal-friendly venues where food is brought in. But animals, other than service animals, cannot be inside a restaurant,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The eatery’s owners say their problems began when a health inspector visited the joint earlier this fall.</p>
      <p>Afterward, the owners said, they were told they had to comply with a nonsensical new rule: No menus or ordering staff allowed on the pet side of the place, which is separated from the non-animal portion by a partially see-through, floor-to-ceiling partition.</p>
      <p>Instead, animal-owners who want to get food must take their pet with them or leave it with a friend or another diner, then go to a special window between the two rooms and place their order. They also can use their phones to order. As always, they then go back to the window to pick it up.</p>
      <p>But not allowing waitresses to help the process “is awkward, and our customers don’t like it,’’ co-owner Logan Mikhyl said.</p>
      <p>She said sales at the pet hot spot have gone down about 15 percent since the change.</p>
      <p>The owners have enlisted some local politicians — from Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer to state Sen. Brad Hoylman, state Assemblyman Harvey Epstein and city Councilwoman Carlina Rivera — to pester the DOH about exactly what health risk online ordering from the pet-friendly side poses.</p>
