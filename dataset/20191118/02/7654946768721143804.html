      <p>A man in Iowa allegedly opened fire in a strip club parking lot after his debit card was declined for a private dance, a report said.</p>
      <p>James Allen Wells, 67, was a patron at the Porsches Theater of the Arts strip club in Waterloo around 11 p.m. Friday when he got a lap dance and stiffed the club, <a href="https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/waterloo-man-arrested-following-chase-shooting-rampage-at-strip-club/article_17f2d536-363a-5792-8f7b-5f2697811c36.html#utm_campaign=blox&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social">according to the Courier</a>.</p>
      <p>After the card was declined, Wells stormed into the parking lot and pulled a .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver from his waistband, firing off five rounds, the report said.</p>
      <p>Multiple cars were struck, including the rear window of a Dodge Durango, the tailgate of a Chrysler Town and County, and the windshield of a Chevrolet Impala.</p>
      <p>The gunman then fled and police attempted to pull him over for speeding â€” but he refused to stop, leading to a short chase.</p>
      <p>Wells eventually crashed his vehicle into a curb and was apprehended after a scuffle with cops. One of the officers injured a hand during the arrest.</p>
      <p>Wells was charged with criminal mischief, reckless use of a firearm, assault on a peace officer and reckless driving.</p>
