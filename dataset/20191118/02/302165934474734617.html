      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 18 — Sony Pictures has released a new featurette for <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> that stars Tom Hanks as US television legend Fred Rogers.</p>
      <p>The story focuses on how a jaded journalist (played by Matthew Rhys) went from being reluctantly assigned to write a profile about Rogers and his <i>Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood</i> show. Along the way, he learns about empathy and kindness, while forming a lifelong friendship with Rogers. </p>
      <p>The film also stars Susan Kelechi Watson, Chris Cooper, Enrico Colantoni, Maryann Plunkett, Tammy Blanchard, Wendy Makkena, Sakina Jaffrey and Carmen Cusack.</p>
      <p>The synopsis of the film reads: “Two-time Academy Award-winner Hanks portrays Fred Rogers, best known as Mister Rogers, in <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood</i>, a timely story of kindness triumphing over cynicism, based on the true story of a friendship between Fred Rogers and journalist Tom Junod. When a jaded magazine writer is assigned a profile of Fred Rogers, he overcomes his scepticism, learning lessons about empathy, kindness, and decency from America’s most beloved neighbour.”</p>
      <p><i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> is set for US release this week.</p>
