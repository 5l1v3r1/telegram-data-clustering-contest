      <p>Japanese telco <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>Corp announced on Monday plans to merge its internet unit Yahoo Japan with messaging app operator Line Corp, as it scoops up struggling internet <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>to bulk up against rivals such as Rakuten.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>said in a statement that Yahoo Japan, which last month changed its name to Z Holdings, will merge with Line, owned by South Korea's Naver Corp, in a deal to be completed by October 2020.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>aim for a definitive agreement by next month in a transaction that will see <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>Corp and Naver form a 50:50 venture that will control Z Holdings, which will in turn operate Line and Yahoo.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp is a unit of investment behemoth SoftBank Group Corp.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp and Naver, which owns 73 per cent of money-losing Line, plan to launch a tender offer for Line's remaining shares at 5,200 yen per share, a 13.4 per cent premium to the share price before news of the merger broke. Line's shares were up 2.6 per cent at 5,180 yen in early trading on Monday.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank.</p>
