      <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Rapper Ja Rule Emerges Victorious - Dismissed From $100 Million Fyre Festival Lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:47:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:47</time> by <a rel="author">GrouchyGreg</a></address>
      <p>Ja Rule is finally cleared in a $100 million lawsuit over the infamous Fyre Festival debacle.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Ja Rule can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p>The Queens, New York rapper has officially been dismissed from a $100 million civil lawsuit fans filed over the infamous <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/ja-rule-admits-to-having-major-trust-issues-following-fyre-festival-fiasco-CCue-iLTqUONlrb1F61v8Q/">Fyre Festival.</a></p>
      <p>Power attorney Mark Geragos is representing scorned attendees who filed the class-action lawsuit against the Fyre Festival's imprisoned founder Billy McFarland and several other executives.</p>
      <p>Ja Rule was also named in the lawsuit, although he was <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/dismissed-fyre-festival-lawsuit-against-ja-rule-reportedly-can-continue-c5wNYaA4L0uxBHEJ7JgOnw/">dropped from the legal action in July of 2019.</a></p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/exclusive-fans-say-ja-rule-knew-fyre-festival-was-a-scam-in-amended-100-million-lawsuit-VDaCdkSLsUeTQTlVWkzHdw/">But Ja Rule, real name Jeffery Atkins, came under the microscope again in October.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Lawyers for Geragos' firm filed an amended complaint in an attempt to have Ja Rule re-added to the class action lawsuit, over allegations he had advance knowledge the Fyre Festival was going to be a flop.</p>
      <p>Last week, a judge sided with Ja Rule and finally blocked any further attempt to go after the rap star.</p>
      <p>"This Court rejected plaintiffs’ conclusory assertions that they relied on defendants’ representations about the Festival as insufficient to state a claim for fraud," Judge P. Kevin Castel ruled. "In the case of Atkins, plaintiffs alleged an actionable false statement, but failed to allege that they acted in reliance thereon."</p>
      <p>Ja Rule's lawyer Ryan Hayden Smith issued a statement to AllHipHop.com regarding the failed attempt to wrangle the hip-hop artist back into the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>"This ruling is nothing short of a total vindication of Mr. Atkins," Ja Rule's lawyer Ryan Hayden Smith told AllHipHop.com.</p>
