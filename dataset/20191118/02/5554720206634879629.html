      <h1>Salman Khan opens up about his ex-girlfriends, calls Sangeeta Bijlani ‘real-life heroine,’ no reaction on Aishwarya Rai but Katrina Kaif leaves him blushing</h1>

      <p><i>Bigg Boss </i>reality show on Sunday night saw the shock eviction of Arhaan Khan, but the <i>Weekend Ka Vaar </i>show became special after a game involving the <i>Bharat </i>star and Anil Kapoor. As Salman and Anil Kapoor teased each other, the latter took a potshot at Salman’s ex-girlfriends. While Salman stunned everyone by opening up about one of his ex-lovers, he gave no reaction to Aishwarya Rai. The mention of his other girlfriend, Katrina Kaif, left him blushing.</p>

      <p>The question was to reveal Salman’s favourite co-stars. Anil Kapoor said that there were many including Bhagyashree, Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai, Karishma and Kareena Kapoor, Sonam (his daughter), Katrina. As Anil mentioned Katrina, everyone including Salman burst into laughter. The <i>Bigg Boss </i>host, however, declined to give any expression on Kapoor’s mention of Aishwarya Rai, who Salman was romantically linked with before she tied the knot with Abhishek Bachchan. Katrina too was reportedly in a relationship with Salman before she split with him to date Ranbir Kapoor.</p>
      <p>After a brief pause, Anil said, “There’s one more favourite co-star you had. She was Sangeeta Bijlani.” Far from being stumped by Anil Kapoor’s joke, Salman replied, “She was my real-life heroine.” Both Salman and Sangeeta had reportedly dated each other for a long time before the latter got married to cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin.</p>
      <p>Anil Kapoor said that Madhuri Dixit and Salman made a perfect on-screen couple. He also revealed that Salman works out when everyone goes to sleep.</p>
      <p>The Bachchan <i>bahu </i>once again featured on <i>Bigg Boss </i>earlier in the programme on Sunday night when Salman addressed Himanshi Khurana as Punjab’s Aishwarya Rai. This was the third time within a week when Aishwarya had dominated the goings-on of the Colors TV reality show.</p>
      <p>Last week during the <i>Weekend Ka Vaar </i>show, Himanshi had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/after-amitabh-bachchans-kbc-aishwarya-rai-features-on-bigg-boss-show-as-host-salman-khan-left-speechless/272104/">left Salman speechless</a> for a few seconds by claiming to resemble Aishwarya.</p>
