      <p>REUTERS: A weakened Saracens team were hammered 30-10 by French side Racing 92 as their European Champions Cup title defence started with a crushing defeat on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Saracens were without England internationals Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and Billy and Mako Vunipola, who were part of the World Cup campaign in which Eddie Jones' side finished runners-up behind South Africa in Japan earlier this month.</p>

      <p>The English champions had said they may have to prioritise Premiership survival over European ambitions after being docked 35 points and fined 5.36 million pounds (US$6.86 million) by the Premiership for breaching salary cap rules.</p>
      <p>The club had said they would appeal the punishment which, if upheld, would leave them bottom of the table with -22 points and in danger of relegation thereby putting the futures of some of their key players in doubt.</p>
      <p>However, British media reported on Sunday that Saracens would drop their plans to appeal ahead of Monday's deadline.</p>
      <p>The club could also face action from European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) after their representatives pulled out of the season's launch of the Champions Cup in Cardiff last week.</p>
      <p>Tries from Virimi Vakatawa, Teddy Thomas, Finn Russell and Wenceslas Lauret ensured Top 14 side Racing 92 secured a bonus-point win in the Pool 4 clash at La Defense Arena on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Saracens centre Alex Lozowski, who had said earlier this week that the club could handle the fallout of their salary cap breach, scored his team's only try.</p>
      <p>Saracens host Ospreys in their next fixture on Nov. 23.</p>
