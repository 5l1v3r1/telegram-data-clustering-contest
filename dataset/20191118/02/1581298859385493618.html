      <h1>First Quantum Minerals restart sees hundreds of jobs</h1>

      <p>More than 100 employees have been recruited and are working at the restarted Ravensthorpe Nickel Operation.</p>
      <p>The recruitment campaign is continuing with more than 350 roles still to be filled at the site.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Canadian-based mining company First Quantum Minerals said the company had received a "substantial response" to its recruitment campaign.</p>
      <p>The company has appointed Anthony Mukutuma to be the general manager of the restart.</p>
      <p>Mr Mukutuma said he was delighted with the progress towards the restart.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of work involved in recruiting a substantial team and preparing the operations for production again, even though the plant and equipment has been kept in excellent condition by our maintenance team," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Mukutuma said local businesses in the region would start to feel the benefits with new families arriving into Hopetoun and other parts of the region.</p>
      <p>"We hope that nearby towns like Hopetoun and Ravensthorpe will soon benefit from our activity and that there is also a noticeable positive impact on larger communities like Esperance and Albany," he said.</p>
      <p>"Our goal is to ensure we are locally focused and benefit the entire region by making the nickel mine cost-efficient and commercially resilient."</p>
      <p>First Quantum Minerals is expected to resume mining operations in Ravensthorpe in early 2020.</p>
      <p>The mine is located about 35 kilometres east of Ravensthorpe and was placed into care and maintenance in October of 2017.</p>
      <p>The closure was a major blow to the Esperance community. There were 500 jobs lost as a result and a quarter of these were at the Esperance Port.</p>
