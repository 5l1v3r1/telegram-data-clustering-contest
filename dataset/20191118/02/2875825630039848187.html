      <h1>Roy Keane smirks as he watches Ian Wright's first challenge in I'm A Celebrity</h1>
      <h2>The former Manchester United midfielder tuned in to Sunday's launch show alongside his ITV colleagues</h2>

      <p>Former Manchester Untied midfielder Roy Keane wasn't able to hide a smirk as he watched fellow pundit Ian Wright enter the jungle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> legend Wright is one of the contestants on the new series of popular ITV show 'I'm A Celebrity... Get me Out of Here!'.</p>
      <p>And the former England international, who regularly features as a pundit for ITV Sport and BBC's Match of the Day, was instantly thrown into the action during the launch show on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The first show of the new series saw contestants split into two teams before facing a number of challenges just to reach their campsites, with many of Wright's colleagues tuning in to show support for the pundit.</p>
      <p>While some of the campers including Nadine Coyle and Caitlyn Jenner were thrown out of a plane, Wright was part of group required to walk along an unstable plank 334ft above the ground before climbing down to a lower platform to hit a button with his foot.</p>

      <p>Although it sounded simple in principle, the challenge was made more difficult by the windy conditions - with only a small safety rope stopping the contestants from falling to the ground.</p>
      <p>Wright in particular appeared to be having a hard time and could be repeatedly be seen fighting hard to stay upright.</p>
      <p>With the programme broadcast just a few hours after England ended their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a 4-0 win in Kosovo, ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley shared footage of the crew watching the former striker in action.</p>
      <p>During the video, shared on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , fellow pundits Glenn Hoddle and Roy Keane, as well as former Gunners' team-mate Lee Dixon could be seen watching the challenge on a projector.</p>

      <p>While some of the onlookers appeared to show concerned reactions as Wright struggled to keep his balance in the windy conditions, others seemed to see the funny side.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of the short clip, Keane failed to hide a smirk while England legend Hoddle - sitting in front of the former Man Utd midfielder - let out a laugh before applauding.</p>
      <p>After the challenge, Wright admitted: "That wind, man, the most frightening thing I've ever done in my life."</p>
      <p>Other names taking part on the 19th series of the long-running show include James Haskell, Kate Garraway, Myles Stephenson, Roman Kemp, Adele Roberts, Andrew Maxwell, and Jaqueline Jossa.</p>
