      </p>
      <p>One of those juicy storylines will be Princess Margarets (played this season by Helena Bonham Cartercue my excitement) crumbling marriage with Lord Snowdon (Ben Daniels). You know how marriage vows say "for better or for worse"? Yeah...theres a lot of "for worse" between these two. Just notice the rather angry Lord Snowdon in a room with Princess Margaret in The Crown season-three trailer.</p>
      <p>To get royally ready for the new season (or simply reassure yourself that your love life could be a heck of a lot messier), lets break down Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdons marriage before it, well, broke down.</p>
      <h3>Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon met at a dinner party.</h3>
      <p>In 1958, Margaret first came across Antony Armstrong-Jones (his "commoner" name back then) at a dinner party for Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, though it actually wasnt the photographer's first encounter with the royal family. A year before, he was commissioned to take portraits at Buckingham Palace, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4120958/Lord-Snowdon-s-sublime-royal-family-album.html">The Daily Mail </a>. (Anthony clearly had the makings of an Instagram hubby well before it was a thing.)</p>

        <p>The social butterflies hit it off, to the tabloids' surprise. The paps didnt catch onto their budding romance until their engagement. "Nobody knew about their relationship; there wasn't a whisper about it, " Anne de Courcy, author of Snowdon: The Biography, told <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/news/a9255/princess-margaret-lord-snowdon-relationship/">Town &amp; Country </a>. "She would see him in secret at his studio, and yes, he would join her at parties, but no one could pinpoint which man she was in interested in. The press focused more on the ones who were seen to be eligible. They didn't think of Tony who was often in the background."</p>
        <p>Well played, Margaret, well played.</p>
        <h3>Margaret and Antony got engaged at an inconvenient time.</h3>
        <p>Remember the relationship between Margaret and Peter Townsend? The first season of The Crown showed this love connectionthat was less-than-loved by the Queenin part because Townsend was ten years older than Margaret and a divorcee (so scandalous).</p>
        <p>Even after Margaret turned 25 and became old enough to no longer need the Queen's permission to marry Townsend, the conventions of the State and the Church of England still meant that the princess "would have had to have given up everything" to continue the relationship, per <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1099594.stm">BBC News </a>.</p>
        <p>They called it quits in 1955, and four years later in October 1959, Townsend sent Margaret a letter explaining that he was engaged. That same night, Margaret decided to marry Armstrong-Jones, according to BBC News.</p>

          <p>"I didn't really want to marry at all. Why did I? Because he asked me! Really, though, he was such a nice person in those days, she later told the then Conservative MP, Jonathan Aitken.</p>
          <p>Since Queen Elizabeth II was expecting a child, the couple had to wait to announce their engagement. (You cant upstage the Queen, after all!) It wasn't until February 1960 that her engagement to the photographerand "commoner"became official. Oh, and peep that ruby engagement ring.</p>

            <h3>A royal wedding was televised for the first time.</h3>
            <p>Princess Margaret walked so Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle could run (okay, technically they walked down the aisle, too). On May 6, 1960, 20 million people in Britain watched on live television as they became the Earl and Countess of Snowdon, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/timelines/ztwthv4">BBC </a>reported, and the extravagant affair set the tone for future royal weddings. (Another 300 million across the world tuned in to the televised wedding coverage.)</p>

              <p>The Duke of Edinburgh (a.k.a. Prince Philip, the Queen's husband) walked Margaret down the aisle in front of 2,000 wedding guests. She wore the Poltimore tiara she bought herself, instead of following the tradition of wearing something on loan from the Queen, according to <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1199507/royal-wedding-princess-margaret-precedent-royal-family-tradition">Express </a>.

                <p>Elizabeth created the Earl of Snowdon title for Anthony on his and Margaret's wedding day. Then, naturally, it was off to the Caribbean for a six-week honeymoon.</p>
                <h3>Both Margaret and Anthony had their share of affairs.</h3>
                <p>As with all honeymoon periods, this one didn't last. All seemed well at the startthe high-profile couple popped from social circle to social circle, rubbing shoulders with the cool kids, and Lord Snowdon took that of the princess. They had two children, David in 1961 and Sarah in 1964...and then the tension started to build.</p>

                  <p>Apparently, their rows (a.k.a. fights) were a big dealand no secret. Rumors of a rift between the royal couple started after seven years of marriage, according to the BBC. It didnt help that both dabbled outside of their marriage, either. Among Lord Snowdons list of lovers included actress and dancer Jacqui Chan (not to be confused with Jackie Chan), actress Gina Ward, and one of his former assistants.</p>
                  <p>Princess Margaret was romantically linked with nightclub pianist Robin Douglas-Home and landscape gardener Roddy Llewellyn, with whom she had a nearly eight-year affair. Per the BBC, they met on the way to a friends house party in 1973 when Llewellyn was 25 years old, a.k.a. 17 years younger than the princess. Its no wonder the tabloids called him her "Toy Boy." (Gag.)</p>
                  <h3>Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon made history a second time togetherfor getting a divorce.</h3>
                  <p>Okay, so this is one way you dont want to make history as a royal, but alas.</p>
                  <p>Days after Princess Margaret and Llewellyn were photographed frolicking in the waters of her villa in Mustique, Margaret and Lord Snowdon announced their separation. Two years later, after 18 years of marriage, they revealed a divorce was next. It was the first time a royal got a divorce since Henry VIII, according to the BBC. Oof.</p>
                  <p>"Even right up until the minute they were getting divorced, they still had a really strong physical relationship," Ben Daniels told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/08/14/the-crown-season-3-september-issue/">Entertainment Weekly </a>. "People often said that it was like foreplay for them, having a big row. They would have these huge rows and then amazing sex." ( <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a19944550/how-to-have-breakup-sex/">Pretty much always a bad idea </a>, jsyk.)</p>
                  <p>After they divorced, Margaret and Antony stayed close throughout the years, proving that, well, you can <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a19918404/friends-with-ex/">stay friends with an ex </a>after all.</p>
