      </p>
      <p>Following <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077319581-taiwan-evacuates-students-from-hong-kong-as-deadly-protest-clashes-continue/">last week's clashes</a>, many protesters withdrew into the university, turning it into a makeshift fortress to fend off the law enforcement officers.</p>
      <p>The police stormed into the university early in the morning, after a prolonged standoff with the protesters, who barricaded themselves in the university's campus. In response, the protesters began hurling Molotov cocktails at them, causing the aforementioned fire.</p>

      <p>The mass protests began in China's special administrative region in early June as a reaction to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to the mainland. The protests eventually <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911171077330390-hong-kong-protesters-set-harbour-tunnel-bridge-on-fire-as-police-prepare-to-move-in---reports-/">escalated into violent confrontations</a> between demonstrators and the police.</p>
