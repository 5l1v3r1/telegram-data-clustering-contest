      <h1>The USI Want Free STI Test For Third-Level Students</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:42:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.spinsouthwest.com/author/ben-finnegan" target="_blank">Ben Finnegan</a></address>
      <p>The USI wants free STI testing for students across the country.</p>
      <p>The group says only one campus in the country doesn't charge people to get checked, which is NUI Galway.</p>
      <p>It follows a report in the Irish Daily Mail that says less than two percent of students are getting tested.</p>
      <p>"There should be free STI testing provided across the country, particularly from a student perspective," said Megan Reilly who is Vice-President for Equality with the Union of Students in Ireland.</p>
      <p>"Student Unions across the country and even at a national level as well we've put a lot of work into campaigns around sexual health because people don't necessarily receive adequate sexual health education in school.</p>
      <p>"So they're coming into college not in the know sometimes. There's not a lot of point sometimes calling attention to the fact that people should get tested and then not having these services available."</p>
