      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:32:12+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> has already made a big prediction about this year's series of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">I'm A Celebrity</a> .</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old isn't talking possible winners just yet - but he has picked out who could be the most bad tempered camp-mate.</p>
      <p>The stars said hello for the first time on Sunday night as things finally got under way.</p>
      <p>Dec usually says what he sees - and Ian Wright is in his eye-line early on.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal striker was the first to hit our screens as he pulled up in a red Ferrari - but will he be seeing red as the days go on?</p>

      <p>"I think there could be one or two spiky characters," the host predicted.</p>
      <p>"He might blow, he might just go - if he gets hungry..... He's also got quite a short attention span."</p>
      <p>I’m A Celeb viewers were distracted by Declan during the launch night.</p>
      <p>He appeared on the show with painful looking marks on his arm - and it left those at home guessing.</p>

      <p>While the marks looked like they could either be bruises or insect bites, viewers had a range of wild ideas about what they could be.</p>
      <p>“What’s up with Dec’s arm? That’s a nasty bruise,” one concerned fan commented on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>“What’s up with Dec’s right arm? Big bruise!!” another said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, his co-host Ant McPartlin has had a poke at controversial Katie Hopkins. He admitted she wasn't his favourite of the bunch of previous I'm A Celebrity campmates.</p>
      <p>Katie, 44, shot to fame on The Apprentice in 2007 and starred in that year's series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>But Ant, 43, told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10360802/im-a-celeb-ant-dec-questions/">The Sun</a> : "Katie Hopkins was in I'm A Celebrity but you wouldn't really remember her doing it, as she didn't really shine."</p>
