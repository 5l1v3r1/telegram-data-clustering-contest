      <h1>Chandigarh: Councillors fume as their names missing on UT invite</h1>
      <h2>Councillors of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation said that they will boycott the event as they have not been given due respect in invitation and their names on the card are not mentioned.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:24:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/hina-rohtaki/" target="_blank">Hina Rohtaki</a></address>
      <p>TUSSLE BETWEEN councillors and officers of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Administration deepened over the event of light and sound show that is to be held at the Sukhna Lake on November 18 and 19. The event is being held by the Chandigarh tourism department and Punjab government.</p>
      <p>Councillors of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation said that they will boycott the event as they have not been given due respect in invitation and their names on the card are not mentioned.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> councillor Arun Sood said, “This is sheer disrespect. The card was just dropped at my place without any name. We will complain to the Administrator. This is happening repeatedly. We will also boycott the event until due respect is given to us.”</p>
      <p>Councillors also decided to meet UT Administrator V P Singh Badnore over the issue. They said, all events of the administration will be boycotted if the administration continued to do the same.</p>
      <p>Mayor Rajesh Kalia said, five cards were just given to his peon without any name. “I know this is wrong. If we go, it will only be because we have to be there at Guru Nanak’s 550th birth celebrations.”</p>
      <p>In the General House meeting held recently, the issue of disrespect to the councillors and mayor by not inviting them to events of the administration was discussed at length and a resolution condemning the administration’s move was passed.</p>
      <p>Mayor Kalia publicly spoke about the same to the UT Chief Engineer who did not invite him to the inauguration of a sports complex, but the same was repeated at an event at Manimajra.</p>
      <h3>At other end of lake</h3>
      <p>The Administration has refused permission to the Punjab government and Chandigarh tourism department to hold the multi-media floating light and sound show at the Regulatory End of the Sukhna Lake with a plea that it will disturb the migratory birds. The event is scheduled to take place on Monday and Tuesday. Officials said that the officials were now considering holding it at the end near the island at the lake.</p>
      <p>Chief Conservator Debinder Dalai said, “They were seeking permission for the Regulatory End, which was refused. We have told them, they can hold it near the island at the other end. In fact, this is the time when migratory birds are here and the loud sound can disturb them and make them fly away.”</p>
      <p>He added, “They are still hoping that they will get permission before the event starts. But when the DC sought comments of department of forests and wildlife, they said the same cannot be given for the regulatory end.”</p>
