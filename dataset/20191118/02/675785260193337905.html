      <h1>Former Man Utd transfer target Milan Skriniar now wanted by Real Madrid and Barcelona</h1>
      <h2>The Inter Milan defender recently signed a new contract with the Serie A giants</h2>

      <p>Milan Skriniar has emerged as a target for Real Madrid and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , according to reports in Italy.</p>
      <p>Inter Milan defender Skriniar has caught the eye of some of Europe's top clubs, and <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/17-63459677/inter_real_e_barcellona_allassalto_per_skriniar/">Corriere dello Sport</a> claims that the two La Liga giants are among those interested in the centre-back.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> over the summer, with some reports suggesting that the Premier League club had an offer of £51million rejected by the Serie A side.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils went on to sign Harry Maguire from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , but it is claimed that the two La Liga giants could look to sign the Slovakia international.</p>
      <p>Although Skriniar recently extended his current contract with Inter, the Italian publication adds that the club would be open to selling for the right price - with a summer transfer believed to be more likely.</p>

      <p>Both Real and Barca are reportedly looking to add defensive reinforcements in the upcoming transfer windows, with both clubs believed to have concerns over their current back-lines.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos are thought to be keen to sign a long-term replacement for captain Sergio Ramos, 33, while Barcelona are also understood to be <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barcelona-and-real-madrid-battling-it-out-for-inters-skriniar-7739656">on the lookout</a> for a defender as a result of frequent injuries to Samuel Umtiti.</p>
      <p>The French World Cup winner, 26, has made just two appearances in all competitions for Ernesto Valverde's side this season after being sidelined by foot and knee problems.</p>

      <p>Since make the move to the San Siro in 2017, Skriniar has become a key player in Inter's defence.</p>
      <p>The former Sampdoria star played 46 times in all competitions last season and helped the Italian giants finish fourth in Serie A.</p>
      <p>The centre-back's impressive displays saw the Nerazzurri reward him with a contract extension in May, which runs until 2023</p>
      <p>And he has reinforced his importance under new manager Antonio Conte, playing every minute of Inter's league and European campaigns so far.</p>
