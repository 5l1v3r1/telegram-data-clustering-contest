      <p>THE Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) has put modalities in place to ensure that Lagos State civil servants  access affordable and decent shelter.</p>
      <p>FMBN Managing Director Ahmed  Dangiwa gave the assurance at a sensitisation workshop organised by FMBN, Ikeja Distrit for the workers last week in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Dangiwa, who was represented by the Executive Director, Business Portfolio and Development, Umar Dankene, said the bank would collaborate with Lagos State Government, to achieve the high target objective.</p>
      <p>The FMBN boss posited that with the rapid increase in population in the country, the need to boost housing delivery cannot be over emphasised.</p>
      <p>On the modalities, he said the bank has evolved products that would suit the needs of Lagos workers at a single digit interest rate.</p>
      <p>“The products would afford workers the opportunity to buy, build or renovate their houses.” he said. “Our process is now automated, our contributors can now get alert for National Housing Fund (NHF) deductions made from their monthly salaries,” the FMBN boss said.</p>
      <p>He revealed that the FMBN has been undergoing transformations and  now in a strong position to deliver its mandate effectively.</p>
      <p>The Branch Manager, FMBN Ikeja District, Mrs. Yetunde  Sowande,  commended the Lagos State Government for considering befitting housing schemes for its workers.</p>
      <p>She said the NHF was established by the NHF Act 3, 1992, as a mandatory scheme for employers of labour, which permits them to deduct and remit  2.5 per cent of the basic monthly salary of its workers earning above minimum wage.</p>
      <p>She said there was provision for the private sector to benefit from the scheme.</p>
      <p>To show the commitment of  the agency, she added that despite  the non-compliance status of Lagos State Ministries and Agencies, some public servants still benefited from  a special product of the bank  Home Renovation Loan – up to the tune of N131.6 million .</p>
      <p>The Head of Service, Lagos, Mr Hakeem Muri-Okunola lauded the FMBN boss for placing Lagos workers on the priprity list.</p>
      <p>Muri-Okunola, who was represented by Foluso Adebayo, urged the participants to use the opportunity extended to them by FMBN  to own homes.</p>
      <p>The state Chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC) of Nigeria, Lagos Council, Comrade  Gbenga Ekundayo, said  the  TUC  would seek ways the scheme would benefit workers maximally.</p>
      <p>“This is what we have been praying for, I task all of us  to  make  use of the opportunity on time,” Ekundayo said.</p>
      <p>Over 200 Lagos state workers participated in the workshop.</p>
