      <p>As the Winter Session of Parliament commences from today, the opposition parties have rallied on the demand for Jammu and Kashmir Lok Sabha MP Farooq Abdullah, held under PSA, to “be allowed to attend Parliament”. In an all-party meeting on the eve of the first Winter Session of Modi 2.0, the Opposition raised the question of the continued detention of leaders in Kashmir. Prime Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a>, who also attended the meeting, said the government was ready to discuss every issue.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In 1863, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/abraham-lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> put an end to slavery in the American South. It was not an easy journey. Civil war had erupted. He was accused of destroying the Republic. Liberals, whose great-grandfathers had attacked Lincoln as a despot, paint a dark picture of Kashmir today. But PM Modi’s actions in the Valley will be seen in a similar light in the future. Modi, like Lincoln, had to demonstrate some toughness. Lincoln didn’t have any choice. Neither did Modi, Ram Madhav writes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>All major indicators of rural demand — sales of FMCG, and of tractors and two-wheelers as well as a decline in real wages, suggest the situation has only worsened since the beginning of the financial year 2019-20. A continuous decline in gold imports over the last four months also indicates the rural stress. The rural consumers are postponing the purchase of non-discretionary items and the possibility of a revival is at least three-six months away.</p>
