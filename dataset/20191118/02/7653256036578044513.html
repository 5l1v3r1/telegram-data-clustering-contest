      <p>NEW DELHI: The government is set to begin consultation with members of Parliament for its ambitious project to redevelop Central Vista and construct a new Parliament building.</p>
      <p>Housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri will give detailed presentations to MPs of both the Houses on Tuesday and Wednesday. The time for the presentation has already been allotted by the presiding officers of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha">Lok Sabha</a> and the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajya-Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a>.</p>
      <p>“We were waiting for Parliament to convene to begin our stakeholder consultation. We will begin the process within the first week of winter session. There are many misgivings and misinformation about this project that needs to be dispelled,” said Puri.</p>
      <p>The ministry would give details on how old office buildings, including Shastri Bhawan and Lok Nayak Bhawan, would be demolished to make way for a Common Central Secretariat. The government has no intentions to alter the facades of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rashtrapati-Bhavan">Rashtrapati Bhavan</a>, North and South Blocks and the Parliament building, an official said.</p>
      <p>“Our plan is to construct a new Parliament by the side of the old structure. One of the houses — either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha — would move to the new building. The MPs would be asked for their suggestions next week,” said Puri.</p>
      <p>The government is planning a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/biodiversity">biodiversity</a> park spread across 70 acre near Rashtrapati Bhavan. This is being done to address the criticism that the project would damage the Green space around Central Vista, a senior ministry official said. “About 80 acre land behind South Block would be used for developing the biodiversity park. Hutments on this land would be demolished,” the official said Puri and his team of officials would inform MPs about status of the project. “All we have done is invited architecture firms to showcase their plan. Only a design consultant has been finalised. We would take on board suggestions of MPs before finalising the design of new Parliament building. After all, they are the end users and need to be involved,” Said Puri.</p>
      <p>HCP Design has been selected as the design consultant for the project. “This doesn’t mean that designs of the other five finalists have been junked,” Puri said. The five companies have given presentations before the Secretary. These may also be presented before Parliament.</p>
