      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Freshman Jahmir Young scored 24 points and Charlotte snapped a long losing streak to ACC opponents by beating Wake Forest 67-65 in overtime on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Seeking to end a 13-game losing streak to ACC opposition, Charlotte scored the first six points after regulation and held on from there. Wake Forest made just 2 of 11 from the field in overtime.</p>
      <p>It marks the 49ers first win over an ACC opponent since an 86-83 overtime win at Georgia Tech on Jan. 2, 2011.</p>
      <p>The largest city in North Carolina, Charlotte is in the middle of the ACC, annually hosts its football title game, and has frequently hosted the ACC basketball and baseball tournaments.</p>
      <p>Jordan Shepherd added 16 points, four in overtime, for Charlotte and Malik Martin had 12 points.</p>
      <p>Brandon Childress had 19 points and Chaudree Brown added 12 for Wake Forest. Adrien White — a transfer from Charlotte — scored 10 points.</p>
      <p>Four days after downing cross-county rival Davidson 71-58 for Charlotte's first win in "The Hornets Nest" series since 2012, the 49ers followed up with a win over the Demon Deacons (2-2).</p>
      <p>Charlotte took a 15-7 lead midway through the first half before Wake Forest rallied forge ahead 25-24 with 2:42 left in the opening half.</p>
      <p>The teams went into halftime tied at 29-all and the margin was never more than six points in the second half.</p>
      <p>Charlotte held a 54-48 lead sith 4:26 to play before Wake Forest hit three 3-pointers in the final 1:19 to force overtime.</p>
      <p>Wake Forest's last chance bounded away when Childress' 3-pointer from the right wing with 7.2 seconds left was off-target. The Deacons converted 10-of-25 3-pointers overall.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Wake Forest: After losing its regular season and ACC opener 77-70 at Boston College, Wake Forest had won two straight before Sunday's loss.</p>
      <p>Charlotte: After five straight losing seasons, including 6-23 in 2017-18 and 8-21 in 2018-19, the 49ers are clearly making progress under second-year coach Ron Sanchez.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Wake Forest: The Deacons will be back in Charlotte on Friday night when they meet Davidson at The Spectrum Center that is the home of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets.</p>
