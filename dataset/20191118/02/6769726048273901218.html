      <p>US student water polo players Kimberly Johnson and Allison Wieseler will make a splash to get the University of WA’s Torpedoes in the Australian Water Polo League finals for the first time since 2016.</p>
      <p>Johnson is a University of Michigan graduate, and played in the National Collegiate Athletic Association in her four years getting a degree.</p>
      <p>She was in the All-American second team.</p>
      <p>“I always wanted to live in another country, especially Australia, and it was the perfect way to do it while playing Water Polo competitively,” she said.</p>
      <p>Wieseler is a graduate of the University of California, and played college water polo in the NCAA while completing a human biology and society degree.</p>
      <p>She decided to come to Perth to decompress from the student-athlete lifestyle, continue water polo and see WA.</p>
      <p>The AWL’s women’s league started in 2004.</p>
      <p>It consists of 10 teams, including Fremantle and the UWA Torpedoes.</p>
      <p>The season starts with home games at HBF Stadium in Mt Claremont.</p>
