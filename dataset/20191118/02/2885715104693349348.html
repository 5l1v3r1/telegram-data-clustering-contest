      <p>A day after a four-year-old child drowned at Eco Park here, his family on Sunday got an FIR registered against the park authorities.</p>
      <p>The body of Abez Sheikh was fished out around 7.30 pm on Saturday evening, almost four hours after he went missing from the children’s park at the amusement park, said police.</p>
      <p>The accident has raised several questions about the security of children at the park which is one of the most popular amusement spots in the city and draws huge crowds especially in the winter.</p>
      <p>After getting the FIR lodged with New Town Police Station against West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (HIDCO), which looks after the park, a family member of the victim said, “The child drowned in a pond which was covered with algae. The park authorities didn’t do anything for three hours to find the child. Today, we have got an FIR lodged against the authorities for lack of security and for sheer negligence.”</p>
      <p>State minister for Urban Development and Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim said, “It is a very unfortunate incident. I am feeling pained to hear about it. I am surprised to see how a child went missing in the presence of his parents and ended up in the pond. People are not supposed to go near that pond which is not a public spot inside the park. We will conduct an inquiry to find out whether there was a security guard near the pond.” HIDCO did not respond to calls for a comment.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, park authorities on Sunday fenced the pond.</p>
      <p>In April, 13 children were injured after they came crashing down from a height of about 10 feet during a joy ride at Eco Park. One of them was critically injured.</p>
      <p>Four children had to be admitted to a hospital and a park staffer suffered a fracture.</p>
