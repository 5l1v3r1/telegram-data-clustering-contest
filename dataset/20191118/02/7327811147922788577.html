      <p>Google is set to unveil a new gaming service this week.</p>
      <p>The tech company says it is launching Stadia, a service for streaming and playing games, in 14 countries on Tuesday, Nov. 19.</p>
      <p>Stadia users don't need a hard copy of games or a console, just the controller.</p>
      <p>To play on Stadia this year, people will have to buy a special subscription bundle for $130.</p>
      <p>Other subscription options won't be available until next year.</p>
      <p>Video game analysts say the content Stadia offers will make or break the service.</p>
