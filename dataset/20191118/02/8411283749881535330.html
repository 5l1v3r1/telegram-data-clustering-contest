      <h1>Apple to capture top spot in 5G smartphones in 2020, says Strategy Analytics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:07:21+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:07</time> by <a rel="author">Rodney Chan, DIGITIMES, Taipei</a></address>
      <p>Apple is expected to enter the 5G race in the third quarter of 2020, leapfrogging to the top in 5G smartphones market, according to Strategy Analytics.</p>
      <p>"It may seem counterintuitive that Apple, which currently has no 5G phones in its portfolio will be able to pass current 5G market leaders Samsung and Huawei," said Ken Hyers, director at Strategy Analytics. "But with three new 5G models coming next year, Apple merely needs to match its current upgrade rates for newly introduced iPhone models to take the lead next year."</p>
      <p>"Currently Samsung is the undisputed market leader in 5G smartphones," said Ville-Petteri Ukonaho, associate director at Strategy Analytics. "But with the two largest 5G markets in 2020, China and the USA, dominated by Huawei and Apple respectively, these two vendors are set to lead in 5G next year."</p>
      <p>But the research firm expects Samsung to regain the 5G crown in the longer term, enabled by its dominance of the overall smartphone market and a broader portfolio of 5G devices across more price-bands.</p>
      <p>Despite the US trade ban, Huawei will remain dominant in China, it added.</p>
