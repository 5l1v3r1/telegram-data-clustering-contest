      <p>The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has urged Nigerians to learn from the Brexit experience and prevent similar occurrence.</p>
      <p>He said this on Friday in a keynote address he gave at Island Club’s 76th-anniversary lecture on Lagos Island.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the topic, ‘Restructuring: Lessons from Brexit,’ Fashola said there were many similarities between Nigeria and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>He said, “Restructuring is a very serious topic because everyone is looking for a better life and it has led to some choices, effective or not; but what we don’t realise is that a new territory doesn’t necessarily translate to a better life.”</p>
      <p>“The people of the United Kingdom were not well informed about the disadvantages of Brexit, Nigerians need to educate themselves on the facts necessary so we do not have to go through what the UK is experiencing. If anything needs restructuring, it must start with us as a people.”</p>
      <p>The Chairman, Island Club, Prince Philip Abumere, said the topic was chosen to “educate and inform the citizens on the advantages and disadvantages of restructuring as a country.”</p>
