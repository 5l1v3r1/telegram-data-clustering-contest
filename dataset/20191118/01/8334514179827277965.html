      <p>SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Max Verstappen won a thrilling Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix for Red Bull on Sunday after the Ferraris collided and Mercedes’ six-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was demoted from third to seventh.</p>

      <p>In a race of safety cars and surprises, Verstappen’s former team mate Pierre Gasly made a first podium appearance in second place for Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso, a rare Honda-powered one-two.</p>
      <p>Hamilton chased the Frenchman across the line for third but was handed a five-second penalty for tangling with Red Bull’s Alex Albon in a frantic finale to the season’s penultimate round.</p>
      <p>“I fully accept responsibility,” said Hamilton, who also collected two penalty points and apologised to Albon for costing the rookie a likely first podium and Red Bull a one-two.</p>
      <p>The Thai, who replaced Gasly at Red Bull in a seat switch last August, finished 14th after being sent spinning in the penultimate lap collision.</p>
      <p>Hamilton’s demotion lifted Spaniard Carlos Sainz, who started last after an engine problem in qualifying, to third and McLaren’s first podium since the 2014 season-opening Australian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Both titles had already been won by Mercedes for an unprecedented sixth year in a row, with Hamilton securing his sixth in Texas two weeks ago.</p>
      <h3>REDEMPTION, MAX</h3>
      <p>Verstappen started from pole position, only the second of his career, but had to twice overtake Hamilton and avoid a near pitlane collision with Williams’ Robert Kubica in a race he otherwise controlled.</p>
      <p>The win was the eighth of his career, third of the season but first from pole.</p>
      <p>It also made amends for last year’s race at Interlagos where he was heading for victory before a coming together with French backmarker Esteban Ocon dropped him to second.</p>
      <p>“Redemption Max, absolute redemption from last year,” Red Bull principal Christian Horner told the 22-year-old over the team radio.</p>

      <p>“The way we fought for it was even better,” replied Verstappen, who led from the start while Hamilton passed Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel around the outside for second.</p>
      <p>Victory lifted the Dutchman to third in the drivers’ championship and best of the rest behind Hamilton and Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas — who suffered an engine-related retirement that brought out a first safety car.</p>
      <p>Leclerc had started the day third overall, 14 points ahead of Verstappen, but a late duel with Vettel ended in recrimination.</p>
      <p>The Monegasque passed the four times world champion, who was starting his 100th race for Ferrari, but Vettel came back and the two banged wheels.</p>
      <p>Vettel’s rear tyre became a flailing carcass while Leclerc, who had climbed from 14th on the grid after an engine change, was hobbled by a smashed front suspension.</p>
      <p>“What the hell?,” shouted Leclerc while Vettel wondered what his team mate was doing. Both were summoned to see the stewards, who took no further action.</p>
      <h3>UNSAFE RELEASE</h3>
      <p>The first pitstop almost cost Verstappen dearly, with the Dutchman held up by Kubica exiting almost into him — an unsafe release that saw the Pole handed a five-second penalty.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, who had pitted moments before on lap 20, was ahead but Verstappen swept past him after a brief duel.</p>
      <p>The Mercedes driver pitted again on lap 44 for fresh tyres, but Verstappen countered with a faster stop of his own.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman then pitted when Bottas pulled over and triggered the safety car on lap 53, with Hamilton — instructed to do the opposite to Verstappen — staying out to become a sitting target at the re-start.</p>
      <p>The second safety car triggered by Ferrari offered Hamilton a chance to take on new tyres and he came back out for a final rush for the podium, with two laps of racing remaining.</p>

      <p>Passing Gasly for third, he tried to pass Albon and collided.</p>
      <p>Finland’s 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen was fourth for Alfa Romeo with Italian team mate Antonio Giovinazzi fifth and Australian Daniel Ricciardo sixth for Renault.</p>
      <p>McLaren’s Lando Norris took eighth place ahead of Racing Point’s Sergio Perez with Gasly’s Russian team mate Daniil Kvyat completing the top 10.</p>
