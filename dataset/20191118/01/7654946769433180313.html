      <h1>Six arrested, one sought in Dominican Republic murder of Patricia Anton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:17:15+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jorge Fitz-Gibbon</a></address>
      <p>Six men have been arrested and a seventh is being sought in the Dominican Republic for the brutal torture and killing of American teacher Patricia Anton, according to news reports.</p>
      <p>Four of the six men charged in the case have criminal records dating to 2017, and two of them are Haitian nationals, <a href="https://noticiassin.com/pn-apresa-a-seis-implicados-por-asesinato-de-profesora-estadounidense-en-puerto-plata/">according to the Spanish-language news agency Noticias SIN</a>.</p>
      <p>Cops are now looking for another man known as “El Venezolano,” or the Venezuelan.</p>
      <p>The arrest comes three days after authorities on the Caribbean island said eight <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/eight-detained-in-dominican-republic-murder-of-patricia-anton/">suspects had been taken into custody</a>. It is unclear if all of the six arrested were among those eight.</p>
      <p>“We are really grateful and impressed by how much effort the police in the island have put to find out what happened,” Anton’s cousin, Adrianne Machina, told the Washington Post.</p>
      <p>“I would love people to know what an amazing mother, teacher, and friend Patty was to everyone,” she said. “She had a huge laugh and was very inclusive.”</p>
      <p>Anton, 63, of Michigan, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/american-teacher-patricia-ann-anton-found-tortured-and-murdered-in-dominican-republic/">was found Tuesday in her apartment</a> after she was tortured, bound and killed, police said. Her cellphone, laptop and plasma TV set were stolen.</p>
      <p>The Italian-born teacher was a curriculum program director at the Mariposas Montessori elementary school in Cabarete, one of the Dominican Republic’s poorest regions.</p>
      <p>The suspects were identified as Michael Marinez Rosario, Heuri Flores Hernandez, Junior Alexis Suarez, Juan Jose Andujar Mella, Oroniel Canario Montero and Alexis Maquey, Noticisas SIN reported.</p>
      <p>Mella, Rosario, Maquey and Suarez have criminal records, police said. Maquey and Suarez are Haitian nationals.</p>
