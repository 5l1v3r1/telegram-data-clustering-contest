      <p><b>John Brant Ellis </b>December 3, 1929-June 15, 2019</p>
      <p>John Ellis was a working-class agitator for fairer work, social justice and peace. If you were engaged with any of those campaigns between 1970 and 2015, he might have taken a photo of you and added it to his remarkable collection. When he died on Saturday, June 15, at home with his partner Dianne Jones by his side, he left that collection in the University of Melbourne Archives as his legacy to us all.</p>
      <p>John Brant Ellis was born on December 3, 1929, at Bay Street, Port Melbourne. Educated at Albert Park Primary School and South Melbourne Technical School, he went on to complete a six-year apprenticeship in typesetting.</p>
      <p>After a brief stint at his trade, he left for a 12-month trip to the US and the UK, armed with his mother’s rather old Kodak camera, to visit relatives and indulge his curiosity. On his return, he went back to his first employer then across to Kalgoorlie, where he married Yvonne Rocchi on April 24, 1954. After they returned to Melbourne, they bought a house in Moorabbin, where they subsequently had three sons Mark, Brant and Dean.</p>
      <p>John joined the Herald and Weekly Times Limited in 1955. Soon after, he became the delegate for the Printing and Kindred Industries Union in which he assumed the role of a constructive irritant to management. Like many of his workmates, he was proud of his craft and kept abreast of technological developments.</p>
      <p>When HWT installed a photographic typesetter, he applied and was appointed supervisor of the phototypesetting department at the Herald Gravure Printers, Hawthorn. While he was pleased his skills had been recognised, he always suspected that management were also pleased to see him out of the way in Flinders Street.</p>
      <p>In 1961, they gave him a three-month Herald travel scholarship to the US and Europe to investigate developments in phototypography. He enjoyed the work at Hawthorn and continued there until his retirement in 1990 and self-published <i>A Working Life</i> memoir in 2012. The job also suited his growing interest in left-wing politics, particularly the peace movement from when his two older sons were approaching conscription age. Many posters for the Campaign for International Co-operation and Disarmament (which he had joined in 1959), opposition to conscription and the American war in Vietnam and environment issues were printed as “foreigners”, unofficial jobs under the “Old Mates’ Act”.</p>
      <p>John attended Dr Benjamin Spock’s anti-war speech at the Moorabbin Town Hall in 1971, where local Nazi Party protesters attempted to disrupt the event. He remembered this as the occasion where he began his consuming interest in photographing left-wing public events. For the rest of his life, he usually carried a camera with him. On one occasion when he and his fellow protesters were unhappy with ASIO taking their photographs, John turned his camera on the spooks. ASIO was not amused.</p>

      <p>There is not enough space for us to contemplate the remarkable span of the Ellis photo collection, much of which he catalogued, making it more readily useable than many not organised by their creator. The University of Melbourne archives site is the best place to begin. One special quality of the photographs is that they were taken by a participant in the events, not merely an observer. This gives many of the images an intimacy missing from more documentary styles of photography. John was proud of his arrest record at demonstrations. These included handing out anti-conscription leaflets, a poverty demonstration, blockades against uranium mining at Roxby Downs and Jabiluka, and demonstrations against US nuclear submarines and Albert Park as the grand prix site.</p>
      <p>John Ellis was driven, in significant part, by curiosity. He visited the US four times, the UK three and Europe twice. He went on one work brigade to Cuba and took two around-Australia campervan trips with partner Dianne. They varied in length from a year to three months. One of his interests in the US was the music of political figures such as Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger. Music was an important part of his life since his youth. He had been a member of South Melbourne and Moorabbin brass bands, the Classical Guitar Society, the Victorian Recorder Guild and the Musique Recorder Group which, one player short, performed at his wake.</p>
      <p>For several years, he was an active member of the Victorian Trade Union Choir, where he rejoiced in the warm musical comradeship of his fellow choristers who “sang him home” at his wake. On one occasion the dodgy heart that carried him off earlier this year caused him to collapse during a choir performance at Trades Hall. As the ambos carried him out on their gurney, he handed me, his nominated photographic apprentice, his camera to “get the decisive moment”. I obliged, and he treasured the shot.</p>
      <p>John had three long-term relationships. His wife, Yvonne, bore their three boys before the marriage ended when he left home in 1984. He and Gloria McMahon, a receptionist at his work, were together until 1993. Dianne Jones’ sister Jill, a fellow anti-uranium activist, introduced her to John at the start of a long and loving relationship that only ended with his death. It lives on in the memory of Dianne and all who knew them as a couple.</p>
      <p>John Ellis was a gentle and enthusiastic man whose talents were mostly turned to good causes. His activist domains delivered many enduring friendships and the warm regard of others who only knew his work. His passion for photography, linked to his various causes, has provided a significant contribution to our cultural heritage which will last long after those of us who knew him are gone. He will live on in the eye that framed those photographs.</p>
