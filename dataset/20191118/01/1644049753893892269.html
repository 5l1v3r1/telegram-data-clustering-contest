      <p>The former businessman, Zeng Guoyuan, infamously known as ‘Parrot Man’ was reportedly found dead at the foot of Block 68 in Geylang Bahru. According to <a href="https://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/parrot-man-found-dead-at-foot-of-geylang-bahru-block">Stomp</a>, two people informed the site that the body was found on Saturday night (16 November).</p>
      <p>A person named Sri saw a police death tent at the foot of Block 68 around 11pm. The other person, Fitzy, was a neighbour of Mr Zeng and often saw him around the area. She said she saw a stain on the ground near that same block.</p>
      <p>The police told Stomp that they were alerted to a case of an unnatural death around 9:45pm that day. In responding to the call, the authorities found a 66-year old man lying motionless at the foot of the block. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.</p>
      <p>The police are still investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>Many people might be familiar with Mr Zeng as <a href="https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/08/28/parrot-man-arrested-at-orchard-road-for-unruly-conduct/">he’s made his share of headlines over the years</a>. In October 2018, he was arrested for hurting two police officers at Geylang Serai. Two months prior, in August, he was arrested for verbally abusing a busker following a verbal scuffle.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he was embroiled in a dispute with the management of Ngee Ann City for posing as someone with a physical disability and sell tissues to passers-by. The management of the mall put out a notice asking people not to donate money to Mr Zeng.</p>
      <p>The nickname ‘Parrot Man’ stuck when he was arrested in 2008 for using abusive language and a couple of police officers. Mr Zeng blamed his pet parrot for getting him arrested. He was charged and fined S$2,500.</p>
      <p>A couple of years later, Mr Zeng tried to contest in the 2011 general and presidential elections, gaining him notoriety.</p>
      <p>In 2014, Mr Zeng was diagnosed with nose cancer, which left him with a gaping hole where his nose used to be, following surgery.</p>
