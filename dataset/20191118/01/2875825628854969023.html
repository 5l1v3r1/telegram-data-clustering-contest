      <p>Stacey Solomon was in tears this evening as she watched Extra Camp this evening - which, for the first time in ten years, didn't feature Joe Swash.</p>
      <p>The Loose Women star, 30, was left feeling emotional tonight as she tuned in to I'm A Celebrity's spin-off show.</p>
      <p>Instead of seeing her boyfriend's smiling face, Joel Dommett was joined by new presenters Emily Atack and Adam Thomas.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> during the episode, she wrote with crying emojis: "Soooo wierd watching #ExtraCamp without you @realjoeswash."</p>
