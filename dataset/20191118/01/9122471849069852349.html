      <h1>Cowboys Player’s Tweet About Dak Prescott, Amari Cooper Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:07:03+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Cowboys got a much-needed road win at Detroit on Sunday afternoon, as they beat the Lions, 35-27, to stay in the lead in the NFC East. As they’ve done for most of the season, Dak Prescott and Amari Cooper led the way.</p>
      <p>Prescott and Cooper, who are playing in the final years of their respective contracts, have been dominating this season.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys’ quarterback set a franchise record today, becoming the first player in Dallas history to throw for more than 3,000 yards through 10 games.</p>
      <p>Cooper, meanwhile, is on pace for another 1,000-plus yard, 10-plus touchdown season.</p>
      <p>Both players should get paid in a big way in the offseason. Cowboys linebacker Justin March knows this:</p>

      <p>Do we think Jerry Jones saw this?</p>
      <p>The Cowboys do have some bigger things to accomplish this season before everyone is going to get paid.</p>
      <p>Dallas (6-4) will take on New England next Sunday. Jason Garrett’s team will need Prescott and Cooper to show up in a big way for that one.</p>
