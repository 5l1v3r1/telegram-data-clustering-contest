      <p>A second section of a major upgrade to the Belfast-Derry road is expected to be completed this month.</p>
      <p>The boost for motorists comes after 7km of the new A6 route was opened between Randalstown and Toome in September.</p>
      <p>Work on the 7.4 km Toome to Castledawson leg has continued since then and a short stretch of that section, near Castledawson, is almost ready.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that weather permitting, it will be open on November 25.</p>
      <p>However, only one lane in each direction will carry traffic.</p>
      <p>The Randalstown to Castledawson work is being carried out as part of a £185m scheme designed to reduce travel times between Derry and Belfast.</p>
      <p>Construction on the Graham Farrans joint venture began in June 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2021.</p>
      <p>Work on part of the route close to Lough Beg has stopped for the winter as it passes through an area visited by Whooper Swans each year.</p>
      <p>Campaigners and some local residents had opposed the work on this section of the road.</p>
      <p>The area was made famous by the poetry of Seamus Heaney who before his death urged authorities to use an alternative route for the planned road.</p>
      <p>Work has also continued on a £220m scheme between Dungiven and Drumahoe, near Derry.</p>
      <p>A consortium involving Sacyr, Wills Bros and Somague began construction on the 25.5km stretch of the A6 in March last year and it is expected to be completed in 2022.</p>
      <p>The project includes a bypass of Dungiven.</p>
      <p>Earthworks are already around half-way complete and two bridge structures have been constructed.</p>
      <p>The construction of an additional eight has also begun.</p>
      <p>Roads expert Wesley Johnston said the project is making progress.</p>
      <p>“I think it's going very smoothly,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Randalstown to Toome section was opened on schedule.</p>
      <p>“It's a much safer road as well, there's no doubt it will save lives.”</p>
      <p>The expert said work was also going well on the Drumahoe to Dungiven scheme.</p>
      <p>“They have done a lot of groundwork and there's construction going on now as opposed to digging,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It's going to be a great road, it's to a very high standard.”</p>
