        <b>IT'S BEEN NEARLY 20 YEARS SINCE YOU APPEARED TOGETHER IN FRIENDS. HAD YOU BEEN LOOKING TO REUNITE?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>JA:</b> We have been looking for years and we just never found the right thing that seemed to click for both of us – and this did.</p>
      <p>Michael [Ellenberg, executive producer] came to both of us and it was kind of a dream scenario. We then figured out a schedule – "it will be this way" but it didn't work that way. It was harder than we all thought, everyone was like: "What have we gotten ourselves into?".</p>
      <p>
        <b>JENNIFER, IT'S YOUR FIRST TV FOR 15 YEARS. ARE YOU GLAD TO BE BACK?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is but it doesn't really feel like it. In terms of the workload, it didn't feel like going back to television so much because the schedule was insane.</p>
      <p>Let me tell you something, this is not what it used to be, it was a lot easier than this. Or maybe we are just a little older?</p>
      <p>But it was fantastic, we had so much fun, we worked so hard, but it was the most rewarding thing I've done in years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE DRAMA EXPLORES THE #METOO ERA. IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE QUITE A RESPONSIBILITY?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RW:</b> I'm enormously grateful to the women who spoke up and exposed the harassment and the hostile work environments that they have experienced. It really felt like a responsibility that we had to help tell those stories but also to reveal the human side of it.</p>
      <p>And I'm also very grateful to Steve Carell (who plays the disgraced TV host) for really joining in on this conversation because men need to be part of it, too.</p>
      <p><b>JA: </b>I think we feel responsibility with any drama, any creative material we are in is a responsibility, but especially this. I think Kerry Ehrin, our writer and creator, really wrote a brilliant script, and layered and complicated characters, and also took a look at this whole new normal that we are all walking through. In a very not black and white (way) she allowed the grey areas to be explored.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT TV REFLECTS THE CURRENT CLIMATE?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>JA: </b>It should at least. What was important to us was the tone and how we approach these subjects, which was as it was happening in the world.</p>
      <p>I know everyone is trying to figure out this new "normal" and the clumsiness of it and the messiness of it and the things you're forbidden to say behind closed doors – so I think they did a really wonderful job.</p>
      <p><b>RW:</b> I think when you get to the place that I'm at or Jen's at, it's important that we advocate for others because it doesn't work if it's just for us.</p>
      <p>It's opening the door for other people so I'm enormously proud to be in this position, I take it very seriously.</p>
      <p><b>JA: </b>We have so much more to do. Twenty years ago, 30 years ago, that's when they were sending women out to pasture – we're just getting started.</p>
      <p>
        <b>YOU'RE EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS ON THE SHOW – IS THE TIDE TURNING FOR EQUALITY IN HOLLYWOOD?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RW: </b>Women are stepping up into leadership positions but it's definitely a gender-balanced production. We had just as many men as women and I think that is great, we are finally getting to parity, which is really nice.</p>
      <p>It was quite a few years later [after Friends] so we had different experience, but it was great to be in a producer position now because we have learned so much and we have a lot to add.</p>
