      <p>Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald truly is an ageless wonder.</p>
      <p>Fitzgerald has some of the best hands of any pass-catcher to ever play the game, as he rarely ever drops a pass, and even at 36 years of age, he can still make big plays to help his team.</p>
      <p>And, not only that, he can also throw his opponents around — even the most dominant ones that are in the mix for the Defensive Player of the Year award.</p>
      <p>He showed that during Sunday’s game against the Cardinals, when he absolutely flattened 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa on this play.</p>
