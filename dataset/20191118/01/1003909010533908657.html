      <h1>Stamps' absence lamented by Calgary Grey Cup enthusiasts who remain upbeat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:49:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:49</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Kaufmann</a></address>
      <p>Grey Cup fever in Calgary has been cooled by the no-show of the hometown Stampeders in next weekend’s big game, says a quarterback of the event’s spirit squad.</p>
      <p>But one of the people carrying on the tradition begun in 1948, when 14 train cars of raucous Stampeders fanatics invaded Toronto for the Grey Cup, said the city will rise above that setback.</p>
      <p>“It’s a disappointment not having the home team in the final when it’s hosted by your own city,” said Alexander (Sandy) Dubyk, spokesman for the Calgary Grey Cup Committee.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a damper, for sure, but Calgary’s in a unique position that the Grey Cup Festival committee’s done a great job . . . it’s a national party no other championship has.”</p>
      <p>The Stampeders have won their way into five of the past seven Grey Cup games but were defeated by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the CFL West Division semifinal showdown on Nov. 10.</p>
      <p>But the defending champs, who put up a 12-6 regular-season record this year, were challenged by numerous injuries and personnel changes.</p>
      <p>That Grey Cup absence won’t put a halt to any of the Calgary Grey Cup Committee’s traditional hijinks, which will include a hotel walk-through by quarter horse Tuffy on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The hotel is being kept a secret, with fans invited to guess the location on social media.</p>
      <p>And the committee is teaming up with the Calgary Stampede to host a series of pancake breakfasts beginning Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Calgary Coun. Shane Keating will join colleagues Ward Sutherland and Ray Jones in flipping flapjacks.</p>
      <p>“We have to take the good with the disappointing but this is still a great way to show the country what Calgary’s all about,” said Keating.</p>
      <p>He noted how the city gave the 2026 Winter Olympic bid a pass, due largely to concerns over costs, while the XGames in Calgary met the same fate after the province pulled its funding and sufficient corporate sponsorship failed to materialize.</p>
      <p>“There are some things in the political world that are worth the money and this is one of them,” said Keating.</p>
      <p>Grey Cup organizers won’t say how many of the 36,000 game tickets remain unsold, but a spokesperson said Sunday tickets are still available, and now that the combatants — the Blue Bombers and Hamilton Tiger-Cats — in the 107th championship are known, it’s expected there will be a renewed push in sales.</p>
      <p>Dubyk said Saskatchewan Roughriders green has already taken over as a CFL colour in the city, with the team’s loyalists flocking to watering holes to watch Sunday’s nail-biting Western final against Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>“Just walking around town, there’s a lot of Rider green,” he said.</p>
      <p>They’ll be joined by the usual contingents of fans representing all the league’s clubs and even those of teams that don’t exist, including the ill-fated Baltimore Stallions, who took to the CFL turf in 1994-95.</p>
      <p>And boosters of one future CFL entry, the Halifax-based Atlantic Schooners, will have a Maritimes “Kitchen Party” space on the Stampede grounds, said Dubyk.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to try their lobster bowls, they’re fantastic,” he said.</p>
      <p>The weather forecast for next Sunday’s game is promising — a high of 3C under partly sunny skies.</p>
