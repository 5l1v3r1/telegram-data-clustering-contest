      <p>A five-year-old went into school with a bag of heroin and told his teachers he becomes a superhero when he takes it, it's claimed.</p>
      <p>On Thursday police officers were called to H.B. Lawrence Elementary School in Massachusetts, US, to reports a child had brought a powdery substance to school.</p>
      <p>The young boy had been showing off a plastic bag stamped with a picture of Spider-Man, with an unknown substance inside.</p>
      <p>The boy told his teacher that when he eats or tastes the powder he turns into a superhero, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Green later told a court.</p>
      <p>He allegedly told the members of staff that he found the bag in his living room at home.</p>

      <p>At one point the child put the bag in his mouth, prompting an adult to take him to the Baystate Medical centre in Springfield.</p>
      <p>Luckily his health turned out to be in good order.</p>
      <p>While the boy was receiving medical treatment officers contacted the pupil's mother who gave them permission to search her apartment.</p>
      <p>There they found Benny Garcia sleeping on his bed, which had bags containing white powder underneath, police say.</p>
      <p>More than 200 bags of heroin and cocaine were taken from the property, court documents state.</p>
      <p>Four walkie-talkies and chargers were also found in a kitchen pantry.</p>
      <p>"The officers located the same sort of baggie (of) heroin stamped ‘Spider-Man’ that the child brought to school in a dresser drawer of the defendant’s bedroom," Mr Green said.</p>
      <p>"When Garcia discovered why officers were inside home and the incident involving his son, he became ‘very emotional."</p>
      <p>The man's son and another child were taken in by the Department of Children and Families.</p>
      <p>"He loves Spider-Man," Holyoke Police Lt. James Albert told the <a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-drug-arrest-30437946">Daily Hampshire Gazette</a>.</p>
      <p>"Our officers were quite taken by it all. You don’t often deal with this."</p>
      <p>Garcia, 29, pleaded not guilty in Holyoke District Court on drug possession and distribution charges and a charge of reckless endangerment of a child.</p>
      <p>He was arrested Thursday on a warrant on a 2018 drug possession charge.</p>
      <p>Judge William Rota ordered Garcia to be held until a dangerousness hearing scheduled for November 20 and revoked his bail on the previous charges.</p>
