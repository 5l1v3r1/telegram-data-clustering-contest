      <p>BANNERS about Sinn Féin's North Belfast general election candidate John Finucane and his family are a hate crime, Sinn Féin has said.</p>
      <p>Several banners have been put up across the city attacking Mr Finucane and his family, including his late father Pat who was murdered by the UFF, a loyalist group with links to the UDA, in February 1989.</p>
      <p>One of the signs has been put up on Mayo Street off the Shankill Road in west Belfast.</p>
      <p>The party said it and Mr Finucane have reported the banners as hate crimes.</p>
      <p>North Belfast MLA Gerry Kelly said the banners were an attempt to incite hatred and should be taken down.</p>
      <p>"The banners inciting people to hatred should be removed immediately and those responsible should be prosecuted," he said.</p>
      <p>"These banners have been erected against a backdrop of threats from loyalist paramilitaries against the UUP, Sinn Féin posters being taken down by masked men and the deafening silence of the DUP.</p>
      <p>"The attacks on John Finucane are an attack on the wider democratic process.</p>
      <p>"The DUP must break its silence on these attacks, defend the democratic process and support the police in taking action against those responsible."</p>
      <p>The DUP has been contacted for comment.</p>
