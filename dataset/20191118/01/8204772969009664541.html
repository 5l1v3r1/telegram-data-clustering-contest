      <h2>Experienced civil engineer’s dismay at construction company ‘looking for a man’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:00:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/kitty-holland-7.2276472" target="_blank">Kitty Holland</a></address>
      <p>A civil engineer with more than 20 years' experience says she was told she was unsuitable for a job on a big Dublin construction project because she is not a man.</p>
      <p>Claudia de Souza (49), from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Brazil">Brazil</a>, had been offered work on the site but when asked if she was a man by text was told “no can do” and the employer was “looking for a man”.</p>
      <p>Discrimination in employment on the basis of gender is illegal under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015.</p>
      <p>Ms de Souza took a career break from her job as a building materials tester with Alphageos Tecnologia Aplicada – one the largest civil engineering companies in Brazil – in 2016 to study English in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a>. She met Myra McGuirk, from Dublin, at the end of 2016 and they married in July of last year.</p>
      <p>While on a student visa she had several part-time jobs, including for a few months as a lab manager with a construction materials testing company.</p>
      <p>Since marrying she is permitted to work full time and has had jobs as a cleaner and packing fruit and vegetables. She completed a course in graphic design at Marion College as well as several courses on preparing for and seeking employment, through Intreo.</p>
      <p>She had her degrees in civil engineering technology from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Sao+Paulo+University">Sao Paulo University</a> of Technology (1994) and from the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=S%C3%A3o+Paulo">São Paulo</a> University of Engineering (1998) translated into English. She also became a member of Engineers Ireland and applied for “hundreds of jobs”.</p>
      <p>“Some have replied, not many,” she said. “Three offered me work. I was so happy, but then when they know I am a woman they told me they are only looking for a man.”</p>
      <p>Most recently, at the end of August, she was offered work by Cork-based recruitment firm KBK Construction Services on a project in Dublin 4.</p>
      <p>She showed The Irish Times an exchange of WhatsApp messages with project director Loughlin Finnegan. She told him her name and he asked: “You a man?” and also provided the name and location of the project.</p>
      <p>Ms de Souza replied: “No, I am a woman but I have experience in construction civil. OK I will be there at 7.15am.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mr+Finnegan">Mr Finnegan</a> answered: “Sorry no can do there [sic] looking for a man for a job mite [sic] have work in a few weeks.”</p>
      <p>“I am shocked,” Ms de Souza told The Irish Times. “I had a good career in Brazil. When I came first my company at home asked me to come back after two months because they needed me, but I stay because I want to improve my English. I have always decided things for myself. I always study, work hard but now I cannot use my expertise. I have a lot.”</p>
      <h3>Sorry to ‘upset that lady’</h3>
      <p>Her wife, who has been unable to work as a carer since having surgery, receives a weekly €208.50 invalidity pension. Ms de Souza as her dependent receives €148.90 weekly on jobseeker’s allowance, a combined income of €357.40 per week. They pay €265 per month on the mortgage Ms McGuirk took out several years ago on their home in Dublin’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=North+Strand">North Strand</a>.</p>
      <p>“We have a home and food,” said Ms McGuirk. “We don’t need much. But what is soul destroying is watching her so depressed, literally crying. She just needs a start.”</p>
      <p>Mr Finnegan said he was “so sorry” if he had “upset that lady”, saying he thought he was speaking to the wife of a prospective worker.</p>
      <p>“The non-nationals, a lot of them get their wives to do the texting and calling because their English wouldn’t be too good. When I realised it was herself was looking for work I was surprised.”</p>
      <p>If he had known, he added, she would not have been offered the work in the first place.</p>
      <p>Asked if he hires women he replied: “No. The work we do is heavy, pouring concrete, steel fixers. It’s all heavy work. In all my 35 years in construction I have never had a woman pick up a hammer beside me.”</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for KBK also apologised for the “misunderstanding” between Ms de Souza and Mr Finnegan.</p>
      <p>“We do get a lot of calls on behalf of the partners, husbands or brothers from women in relation to jobs . . . KBK Construction Services has absolutely no issue with employing men or women as long as they meet the requirements set up by our clients . . . We are subcontractors supplying labour to main contractors or other subcontractors throughout the country.”</p>
