      <p>ENERGY efficiency and business competitiveness will be top of the agenda for the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry's upcoming energy forum.</p>
      <p>Hosted in partnership with SONI, the event will be held in Invest NI's Belfast headquarters on Thursday December 5.</p>
      <p>The economic support agency's energy and resource efficient programme manager, Rachel Sankannawar, will discuss the benefits of energy efficiency for business and outline the practical ways local companies can save money and increase productivity though sustainable energy use.</p>
      <p>Delegates will also hear from Paul Friar, general manager at Smufit Kappa, a market leader in the production of packaging and point of purchase solutions.</p>
      <p>Paul will share the background and most effective elements of Smurfit Kappa's sustainability strategy.</p>
      <p>Other speakers will include Alistair Jinks, director of business services at NI Water and Eddie McGoldrick, founder of PowerOn Technologies, an innovative start-up in the emerging energy services market in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the event, NI Chamber chief executive Ann McGregor said: “The final energy forum of 2019 is an opportunity for both energy users and suppliers to come together and hear about the practical ways they can adapt their energy use to reduce costs and improve the overall bottom-line.</p>
      <p>“At the close of the year, with companies looking to 2020 plans and budgets, the timing of this event is particularly relevant, so we hope as many companies as possible make the most of the opportunity.”</p>
