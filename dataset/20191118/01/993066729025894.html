      <p>While some fashionistas have sworn off tights for good (no matter how cold it gets), Katie Holmes makes a strong case for embracing hosiery with her latest red carpet appearance.</p>
      <p>Attending back-to-back events in New York, the 40-year-old actor looked stunning in an all-black ensemble of long-sleeved Saint Laurent dress, sheer spotty tights and suede court heels, which promptly landed her on all the best-dressed celebs lists.</p>
      <p>Teamed with a bold red lip and a glossy blow-dry, the mum of one channelled Eighties style but in such a chic, understated way.</p>
      <p>The former Dawson's Creek star has been killing it on the fashion front, and this is one look that's a cinch for anyone to copy.</p>
      <p>You've probably already got a favourite little black dress and court heels in your wardrobe, so all you need is a pair of on-trend tights to complete the look.</p>
      <p>Hot hosiery is easy to find on the high street right now, with spots, stars and sparkly embellishments making them the perfect addition to your LBD for party season.</p>
      <p>Plus, if you're feeling self-conscious about your pasty legs in winter (us too), patterned sheer tights give you a bit of coverage but are still subtly sexy.</p>
      <p>We're also loving the return of another Eighties favourite: Fishnet tights. They are great for creating a smooth silhouette and are less likely to ladder than delicate 10 denier types, which is a bonus.</p>
      <p>Ready to accessorise your favourite frock? Here's our pick of the best sheer tights to buy now...</p>
