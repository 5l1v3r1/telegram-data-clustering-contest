      <h3>Australia star Ellyse Perry is set to be sidelined for the remainder of the WBBL home and away season after suffering a shoulder injury on Sunday.</h3>
      <p>Perry suffered an injury to her AC joint in her right shoulder after attempting to stop a six by Melbourne Renegades young gun Courtney Webb on the long on boundary during the 12th over.</p>
      <p>The Sixers captain was forced to field the ball left handed for the remainder of the innings, hiding herself away from dangerous field placements, as the Renegades won on the final ball of the innings.</p>
