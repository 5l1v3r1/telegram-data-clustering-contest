      <p>North Carolina rapper <b>J. Cole</b> is low-key big mad. The hip-hop star has come forward to show his support for <b>Colin Kaepernick</b> after a controversial NFL workout went down over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Cole <a href="https://twitter.com/JColeNC/status/1196230327578042368">hit up Twitter</a> to keep things 100 on feeling the NFL did Kaepernick’s comeback chances dirty.</p>

      <p>According to reports, the NFL <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/11/colin-kaepernick-bizarre-nfl-tryout.html">put together some last-minute</a>, dramatic requirements for Kaepernick’s Saturday workout.</p>
      <blockquote>While Kaepernick agreed to participate on Saturday (and did so within that arbitrary two-hour window), disputes soon arose between his camp and the NFL. League officials reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1194787406811213825">rescinded their offer to provide a list of team officials</a> who were planning to attend. On the day of the workout, it was announced that cameras—including Kaepernick’s own video crew—would not be allowed inside the Falcons’ facility and that the NFL would be providing video of the session after the fact. The NFL also asked Kaepernick sign a waiver that his attorneys described as “unusual.” He declined. (SLATE)</blockquote>
      <p>Despite the dramatic coverage, <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1196048896717443072">Kaepernick reportedly showed off</a> his NFL capabilities and skills during Saturday’s workout.</p>

      <p>Some reports claim music mogul and NFL business partner <b>JAY-Z</b> <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/11/17/jay-z-calls-colin-kaepernick-workout-publicity-stunt">had an issue with Colin’s</a> decision to switch workout locations.</p>
      <blockquote>According to a source, the rapper-turned-businessman is “disappointed with Colin’s actions and believes he turned a legitimate workout into a publicity stunt. “Kaepernick requested to shoot a Nike ad as a part of Saturday’s workout, featuring the quarterback and mentioning all the NFL teams present at the workout. The NFL agreed, but Kaepernick informed the league of his decision to change the location of the workout on Saturday at 2:30 p.m., moving the event from the Falcons’ practice facility to Charles R. Drew High School in Riverdale, Ga. (Sports Illustrated)</blockquote>
