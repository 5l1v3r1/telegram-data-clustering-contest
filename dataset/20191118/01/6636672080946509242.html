      <h1>Ed Gets The Bum’s Rush</h1>

        <b>We have the works on our opponents – policies, strategies, campaign appearances, dirty tricks, media events, scandal revelations – the lot, Ed confides to his diary, it’s like cracking Enigma – we know exactly what the opposition are going to do next.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All thanks to Greaser’s cyber-spy outfit Scunthorpe Systematica which penetrated their system while feinting a Denial of Service attack. The PM promises me a Dukedom if this works out but the PM’s promises are for show not to go.</p>
      <p>Thanks to a heads-up from SS about the opposition’s broadband plans, Greaser is now preparing to IPO his trench digging subsidiary, FossLux, which, thanks to me, has received government approval for fibre installation. </p>
      <p>The publicity from both main parties’ broadband initiatives is going to push FossLux’s value sky-high.  Whoever wins this election – gigabit broadband is now seen by the public as a right.</p>
      <p>I get Greaser on the blower.</p>
      <p>“If we lose the election, Greaser, I shall be available to help with the FossLux IPO.”</p>
      <p>“How, Ed?” asks Greaser.</p>
      <p>“I would be prepared to serve on the FossLux board.”</p>
      <p>“And how would that help the FossLux IPO, Ed?”</p>
      <p>“Having a Peer of the Realm, a former Cabinet Minister and an ex technology CEO on the board would give the IPO greater credibility, Greaser.”</p>
      <p>“Really Ed? Are pols seen as trustworthy? Or are they seen as opportunistic, on the make, chancers? Having you on the board would be a negative.” </p>
      <p>“Steady on Greaser, I have contacts, influence, friends . . . . . .”</p>
      <p>“Who will all be useless if you lose the election, Ed. We’ll need friends in the new government. Your association with us would be harmful.”</p>
      <p>“But we’re old muckers, Greaser.”</p>
      <p>“True Ed, but business is business.”</p>
