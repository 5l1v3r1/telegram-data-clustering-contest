      <h1>Germany Makes Measles Vaccinations Compulsory For Children</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes CNN: <i>Germany's parliament has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/health/germany-measles-fine-intl-scli-grm/">voted to make measles vaccinations compulsory for children</a>, with parents who fail to immunize their children facing fines of â‚¬2,500 ($2,750). The Measles Protection Act, which the Bundestag approved on Thursday, requires all parents to provide evidence that their child has received two measles vaccinations before they are enrolled in school or kindergarten. Medical staff, daycare workers, teachers and workers at community facilities must also be vaccinated under the act, which is due to come into effect in March 2020, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health told CNN. <br/><br/>There has been a resurgence of measles -- a highly infectious viral illness that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes -- across the globe... Almost 350,000 measles cases were reported globally in 2018, according to the United Nations children's agency UNICEF -- more than doubling from 2017.</i></p>
