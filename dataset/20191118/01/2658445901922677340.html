      <p>SIR: I opted to go to Kaduna by train for the first time recently. To do that, I took advantage of the public holiday declared by the federal government to celebrate this year’s ‘Eid Maulud in Kano. But while boarding the train from Abuja to Kaduna, my mind was caught in some kind of deep contemplation about the Nigeria elite class struggling to reap where he did not sow!</p>
      <p>First, I discovered how agitated and miserable average life of Nigeria elite has become, and the panic modes which overshadow it today. I also saw firsthand, how the elites are paying the price of ineptitude and corruption having equally become victims of their own shadows and reaping abundant harvest of what their actions and in actions had caused in the social-economic architecture of the nation.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I saw palpable fear and trepidation vividly and graphically written all over them. The train journey also afforded me golden opportunity to watch more closely the sorry countenance and miserable visage engulfing the Nigeria elite class at the moment!</p>
      <p>Today, the hunter has indeed become the hunted. Many security officers of different shades and ranks can be seen inside the train sheepishly fearing their own shadows, and unable to wear their uniforms; while at the same time silently looking around in what could clearly be described as aggravated and heightened fear mode.</p>
      <p>In the same vein, some otherwise respected but terrified senior civil servants, and yesterday’s men and women could also be seen being squeezed like crayfish somewhere and in-between train coaches. This actually got me thinking about what could have forced otherwise proud Nigerian elite to willingly stoop so low like internally displaced persons (IDPs) with some of them barely managing to sit on bare train floors?</p>
      <p>Indeed, when you see the sweat and the struggle and the physical exertions of the elites with ordinary poor mortals for the purchase of the very few tickets available at the train stations, you realized that a golden opportunity to make Nigeria better have been lost. The struggle and the fighting to purchase the ticket to ‘stand’ all the way to Kaduna from Abuja was indeed a dog-fight.</p>
      <p>The train journey was also rare opportunity to silently eavesdrop into some of the elite discussions lamenting the terrible security situation in the country and the trouble with having to travel in the over-loaded train. They don’t like mingling with the ordinary people, but they have no option. And we too don’t like mingling with them, and if we have an opportunity, none of them will board the train again!! Let them go by road and taste a bit of their own making!</p>
      <p>But what could have been had the Nigeria elite patriotically and selflessly emulate their forebears and do the right things in their own area of responsibility for the nation? Had they behaved differently in managing the affairs of Nigeria with the fear of God, the craze for travelling by train like traumatized IDPs, could have been avoided.</p>
      <p>And all these pointed to one single fact, that children of the poor who were victims of an unjust system, and whose life have been destroyed through series of political and economic sabotages by the elite class have now made a 360 degree turn-around; and are busy subjecting their oppressors into miserable and dejected life of having to travel like miserable refugees on stormy high-sea. And what a pity?</p>
