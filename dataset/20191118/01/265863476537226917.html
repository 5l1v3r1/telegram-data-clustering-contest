      <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger seems the type to give great advice for some reason and as it turns out, that is actually the case! The star’s son, 22 year old Joseph Baena shared with HollywoodLife some things his father has taught him.</p>
      <p>At the time, the young man was in attendance at Go Campaign’s Annual Gala and he had a chat with the news outlet about his relationship with his famous dad.</p>
      <p>Judging by what he had to say, it’s safe to assume that Joseph has a very good opinion of his father.</p>
      <p>After all, he could not stop raving about how close they are during the interview.</p>
      <p>So when asked about their relationship, he gushed that ‘It’s great! I love my dad! We hang out all the time! He is a great father! That’s really all I have to say about him! We train together, we eat together. We do many things together. I have nothing bad to say about my father. I love him! He is a jokester! He can be intense sometimes. He knows how to get things done. If he needs to get things done, he is going to get things done. He is serious about his work and what he does.’</p>
      <p>And that was not all he dished about his actor, politician and bodybuilder dad!</p>
      <p>Joseph also made sure to tell the site’s reporter that Arnold never hesitates to give his son the best advice he can give and it appears that he is very grateful for it!</p>
      <p>Apparently, the biggest piece of advice he received from Arnold was just to give his all in anything he does!</p>
      <p>‘Put 100% into what I’m doing. Whether that is training, working, school. Just give it my all. Leave nothing. No regrets that I didn’t put enough effort in. I think that was huge for me!’ he dished.</p>
