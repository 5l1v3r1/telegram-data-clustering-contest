      <p>A Sydney police officer allegedly failed to look at the full criminal record of a sexual predator on parole and failed to notify community corrections staff about fresh allegations made against him, days before the man went on to sexually assault a seven-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Anthony Peter Sampieri, 55, pleaded guilty in June to 10 charges including three counts of having sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years, after he waited in the women's bathroom of a dance studio in Sydney's south in November 2018 and set upon a young girl when she walked in.</p>

      <p>Sampieri, who had been watching pornography and touching himself, tied up and assaulted the young girl, filmed part of the assault, then stabbed a man who came to her aid.</p>
      <p>He has also pleaded guilty to seven counts of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend, over explicit phone calls made to numerous women. He will return to court on December 9.</p>
      <p>On Monday, police officer Andrew Michael Bruce faced a hearing in Downing Centre Local Court on two charges of neglecting his duty during the investigation into the phone calls. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Director of Public Prosecutions solicitor Sally Stuart said in her opening statement that the alleged neglect spans a period of about 12 days.</p>
      <p>Ms Stuart said a woman had been receiving sexually harassing phone calls from a stranger in September and October 2018 and went to Kogarah Police Station on October 22 after receiving the second call.</p>
      <p>Senior Constable Bruce began investigating, and on November 4 he received results which told him the private number making the harassing calls belonged to the mobile phone of Sampieri.</p>
      <p>"At the time, Sampieri was on parole for serious offences," Ms Stuart said.</p>
      <p>She said because of this, Sampieri's entry in the police database popped up with a warning screen which said he was on parole and the officer "should notify the local Community Corrections office of any adverse contact with Sampieri".</p>
      <p>The prosecution alleges Senior Constable Bruce opened up one record on Sampieri's profile, which contained information about previous threatening calls, but "did not look at any of the other events ... or at his criminal history".</p>
      <p>"It is the prosecution case that the accused did not conduct proper investigation into Sampieri's criminal history," Ms Stuart said.</p>
      <p>Senior Constable Bruce and another officer went to Sampieri's home on November 7 and spoke to him, in an interaction recorded on body-worn camera, however he was not arrested on that day. He attacked the young girl eight days later.</p>
      <p>The woman who reported the phone calls, who cannot be named, told the court she feared for her life after receiving the calls because she is a real estate agent who regularly runs open homes on her own.</p>
      <p>She said it wasn't what Sampieri said on the calls that bothered her, it was the "very creepy" way he said it.</p>
      <p>"I've been harassed before, but nothing like this," she said.</p>
      <p>The woman said Senior Constable Bruce contacted her several days after her complaint and told her that Sampieri is the person who called her, describing the sex offender as having " a minor history ... he's not very well".</p>
      <p>She said she then went to work, searched Sampieri in her real estate database, and Googled him.</p>
      <p>"It came up with an article, he raped a 60-year-old woman at Fairy Meadow, went to jail for six years, was out on parole," the woman said.</p>
      <p>She said she then called the police officer and told him she feared for her life and wanted a restraining order.</p>
      <p>"I said 'I've Googled this man and he just doesn't have a minor history, it's a big one," she said.</p>
      <p>"I was obviously freaked out, scared ... I could tell by this man's voice that he was a nasty piece of work."</p>
      <p>The hearing continues.</p>
