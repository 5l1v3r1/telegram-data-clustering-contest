      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/dolly-castro/">Dolly Castro</a> shared a new Instagram update today, as she showed off her hourglass figure in a pink dress. The piece had long-sleeves and a low neckline, with lace-up accents down the front center. The laces tied into a bow by her chest and created a cinching effect. The dress was a light shade of pink. She infused a little contrasting color in the ensemble with her bright yellow manicure. Her look was completed with a pair of gold sandals and a red pedicure. Thanks to the low cut of the dress, her cleavage was on full display.</p>
      <p>The stunner posed outdoors in the photo. She popped her right knee, placed her hands on her hips and smiled widely. Her eyes popped thanks to her dark makeup. Her lips were red and shimmery. She tilted her chin slightly up for the snap. Dolly sported her hair down in a middle part, with her locks falling down behind her shoulders. The strands of hair that framed her face featured blond highlights.</p>
      <p>In the picture, Dolly also wore a chain charm necklace, which featured four different charms in the front. Additionally, she also wore a pair of earrings that appeared to be Chanel. A gold bracelet could be seen on her left wrist. Her skin seemed to be glowing in the shot.</p>
      <p>The photo was geotagged in Laguna Beach, California. In it, she stood on a sidewalk in front of a metal sculpture. The sculpture was mounted on top of a white block and showed a person crouching close to the ground while playing a hand flute. The person’s muscles were emphasized, and their hair was pulled back into a bun. Behind the sculpture was a glass door, which was propped open. Next to the stunner, there was a planter with green foliage.</p>

      <p>The Nicaraguan model shared another update a couple of days ago in which she rocked another <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5746081/dolly-castro-dress-instagram/">skintight dress</a>. That time, she wore a gold outfit. It featured an asymmetrical hem and a wrap-around style neckline. D0lly posed outdoors in front of reflective windows and played with her hair while giving her signature smile. The reflection of the model in the background revealed what she looked like from behind. Her look included a gold Chanel necklace and matching sandals.</p>
