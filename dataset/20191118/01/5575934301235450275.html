      <p>It’s no surprise Macquarie’s CEO is making bank, but this time it’s different.</p>
      <p>Macquarie Group’s CEO Shemara Wikramanayake is the highest-paid chief executive in Australia – becoming the first woman to take the title position – <a href="https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/leaders/a-woman-tops-ceo-pay-ranks-for-the-first-time-20191113-p53acv">according to The Australian Financial Review’s latest CEO pay survey</a>.</p>
      <p>Wikramanayake topped the latest list with a reported pay of more than $18 million, according to the survey, conducted by data company OpenDirector. It ranks the 50 highest-paid CEOs in the country, using figures based on the total pay listed in annual reports.</p>
      <p>Wikramanayake was one of four women on the list including Coca-Cola Amatil CEO Alison Watkins ($4.1 million), Mirvac Group CEO Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz ($4.8 million), and Fortescue Metals CEO Elizabeth Gaines ($5 million).</p>
      <p>Wikramanayake <a href="https://www.macquarie.com/au/about/newsroom/2018/nicholas-moore-to-retire-november-2018">was announced as managing director and CEO of Macquarie Group back in July 2018</a>, taking over from Nicholas Moore. She made history at the time by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/macquarie-bank-new-ceo-shemara-wikramanayake-2018-7">becoming Macquarie’s first female CEO</a>.</p>
      <p>Starting at the investment bank – known informally as the ‘millionaires’ factory’ – in 1987, Wikramanayake ascended in rank to head up Macquarie’s asset management division in 2008 and eventually CEO. During her time,<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/macquarie-bank-new-ceo-shemara-wikramanayake-2018-7"> Wikramanayake has worked in nine cities across six continents</a> and established <a href="https://www.macquarie.com/au/about/newsroom/2018/nicholas-moore-to-retire-november-2018">Macquarie’s corporate advisory offices in New Zealand, Hong Kong and Malaysia</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2019, Wikramanayake was named one of <a href="https://fortune.com/most-powerful-women-international/2019/">Fortune’s ‘Most Powerful Women’ internationally</a>. According to Fortune, Wikramanayake focused on climate change this year, becoming one of a handful of CEOs to be named as a commissioner of the World Bank’s Global Commission on Adaptation. The initiative, which counts Bill Gates and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon among its list of commissioners <a href="https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/global-commission-adaptation">aims to ramp up action to fight climate change</a>.</p>
      <h3>Who else made it on the list</h3>
      <p>Only five CEOs earned over $10 million dollars in the AFR’s CEO pay list. Following Wikramanayake’s more than $18 million pay was Gregory Goodman, CEO of property company Goodman ($12.8 million), biotech company CSL’s CEO Paul Perreault ($11.7 million), Treasury Wine Estate CEO Michael Clarke ($11.4 million) and BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie ($10.5 million).</p>
      <p>Qantas CEO Alan Joyce ranked 18th on the list at $6.6 million, a 14.7% decrease from the year before.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/top-paid-ceos-in-australia-2019-2019-9">Earlier this year the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) </a>revealed the 10 highest-paid CEOs in the ASX200 listed companies in the 2018 financial year. The ACSI list, however, looked at the ‘realised pay’ – the value of cash and equity received – with Qantas boss Alan Joyce topping the list at the time at $23.9 million.</p>
