      <h2>Letter claims David McClay’s membership of Gafcon group ‘antithetical’ to new role</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/patsy-mcgarry-7.1837384" target="_blank">Patsy McGarry</a></address>
      <p>Thirty-six senior <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Church+of+Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> clergy have put their names to an open letter objecting to the appointment of the newly elected Bishop of Down and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Dromore">Dromore</a> due to his involvement with a conservative Anglican group.</p>
      <p>In a letter to the church’s House of Bishops, the signatories say they are concerned Archdeacon David McClay may not be an appropriate choice due to his membership of the Gafcon (Global Anglican Future Conference) <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> movement.</p>
      <p>They believe the group’s policies are “antithetical” to the principles a Church of Ireland bishop must commit to in the rite of consecration. These include “fostering unity, care for the oppressed, and building up the people of God in all their spiritual and sexual diversity”.</p>
      <p>Gafcon was founded in 2008, originally to oppose same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ+ people. It has proclaimed itself as a unique upholder of biblical orthodoxy and as “a global family of authentic Anglicans standing together to retain and restore the Bible to the heart of the Anglican Communion”.</p>
      <p>The letter says a Gafcon taskforce last June recommended that “the provinces of Gafcon should retain the historic practice of the consecration only of men as bishops”. In 1990, the church voted in favour of ordaining women as deacons, priests and bishops. It has one woman bishop currently, Bishop of Meath and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Kildare">Kildare</a> <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pat+Storey">Pat Storey</a>.</p>
      <h3>‘Uphold the doctrine’</h3>
      <p>“How could Archdeacon McClay possibly accept a woman as his colleague in the House of Bishops or uphold the doctrine of the Church of Ireland on women in the episcopacy?” the letter asks.</p>
      <p>Among those who signed the letter are former head of the church’s Theological Institute in Dublin <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Canon">Canon</a> <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=John+Bartlett">John Bartlett</a>; Dean of Dublin <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Dermot+Dunne">Dermot Dunne</a>; Dean of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Waterford">Waterford</a> <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Maria+Jansson">Maria Jansson</a>; Dean of Kilkenny David Mac Donnell; Dean of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Limerick">Limerick</a> <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Niall+Sloane">Niall Sloane</a>, and 12 canons of the church.</p>
      <p>On November 4th last, the episcopal electoral college for Down and Dromore diocese chose Archdeacon McClay to succeed Bishop <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Harold+Miller">Harold Miller</a>, who retired in September. Before he can assume office the archdeacon’s election has must be confirmed by the House of Bishops.</p>
      <p>That is due for consideration at its next meeting on Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Full text of letter sent to Church of Ireland House of Bishops:</h3>
      <p>Dear Members of the House of Bishops,</p>
      <p>Archdeacon David McClay has been elected as potential Bishop of Down and Dromore, the largest diocese in the Church of Ireland. His election will need to be confirmed by the House of Bishops on Wednesday, 20th November, to come into effect. The following does not impugn his sterling work in parochial ministry, but raises real concerns regarding the appropriateness of his membership of the Council of Gafcon Ireland (Global Anglican Future Conference) in relation to his election as bishop.</p>
      <p>In the rite of Consecration of a Bishop, bishops must commit to:</p>
      <p>“share with their fellow bishops a special responsibility to maintain and further the unity of the church</p>
      <p>“promote unity, peace, and love among all Christian people</p>
      <p>“guard the faith, unity and discipline of the Church</p>
      <p>“help the oppressed</p>
      <p>“unite its members in a holy fellowship of truth and love</p>
      <p>“use one’s authority to heal, not to hurt, to build up, not to destroy</p>
      <p>(Book of Common Prayer pp.574- 583)”</p>
      <p>The policies of Gafcon are antithetical to these principles of fostering unity, care for the oppressed, and building up the people of God in all their spiritual and sexual diversity.</p>
      <p>Gafcon, founded in 2008, is a movement to outlaw same-sex marriages, the ordination of LGBTQ+ people, proclaiming itself as the unique upholder of biblical orthodoxy and systematically undermining the global diversity and unity of Anglicanism.</p>
      <p>1. As recently as June 2019, in a taskforce on Women in the Episcopate, it recommended that “the provinces of Gafcon should retain the historic practice of the consecration only of men as bishops”.</p>
      <p>2. In Ireland, all extant Christian practice is under question. Gafcon Ireland has stated that Gafcon Ireland has Theological Education and Church Planting as its two main objectives. On an island of approximately 6.6 million people, vast swathes are without faithful gospel witness. We seek to train and deploy those who will preach and build churches. Is ecumenism to be replaced by proselytisation?</p>
      <p>3. Thirty years ago the Church of Ireland voted for the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops. Is this now to come under question? How could Archdeacon McClay possibly accept a woman as his colleague in the House of Bishops or uphold the doctrine of the Church of Ireland on women in the episcopacy?</p>
      <p>4. Who will decide the agenda of his episcopacy, Gafcon or the General Synod the Church of Ireland? One cannot serve two masters.</p>
      <p>5. We urge the House of Bishops to exercise spiritual leadership and not confirm this appointment.</p>
