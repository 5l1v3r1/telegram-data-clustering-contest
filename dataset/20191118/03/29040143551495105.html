    <meta property="og:description" content="Google Stadia has revised its launch list. Instead of only launching with 12 games, the service will now launch with 22. Unfortunately, it's still a lot less than what Microsoft is offering with Project xCloud Preview, but it's a great start. Hopefully, more developers and publishers will put their games on the platform."/>

      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Stadia is an upcoming cloud gaming service.</li>
        <li>It's expected to launch on November 19.</li>
        <li>Only 22 games will be available at launch, with some more coming before 2020.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>A few days ago, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-stadia-launches-12-games">Google Stadia</a> team said that the service would only launch with 12 games. As expected, this sparked a lively debate on social media because a lot of the games were older experiences. Today, Android Central received another press release saying that Stadia was now launching with 22 games. You can read about them below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection</li>
        <li>Farming Simulator 2019</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
        <li>Football Manager 2020</li>
        <li>Grid 2019</li>
        <li>Gylt</li>
