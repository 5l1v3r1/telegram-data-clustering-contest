      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:17:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>Grab Malaysia is now piloting its new GrabMart service starting today, 18th November 2019. The new service will enable users to order daily necessities on demand such as grocery items, fruits, health and beauty products, stationery and other goods and services from the Grab app.</p>
      <p>At the moment, GrabMart covers selected partners such as Guardian, Caring, MyNews, MBG, MPH, Big Pharmacy, Kiara Supermarket and Utama Florist. If you want to give it a try, Grab is currently running the pilot service in Damansara Uptown, Bandar Utama, TTDI, Kota Damansara, Mutiara Damansara, Mont Kiara and Hartamas.</p>
      <p>To access GrabMart, launch the Grab app and then select Food. Below banners, you should be able to find a “GrabMart” icon. You can follow the step-by-step process above.</p>
      <p>The service works very similar to <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/02/13/grabexpress-malaysia-officially-available-klang-valley/">GrabExpress</a> and you can pay via GrabPay while earning GrabRewards Points. The delivery charge will range from RM5 to RM9 depending on the travel distance.</p>

      <p>According to Grab, the service is inline with its commitment to support and grow income opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as to grow the number of delivery partners. The Grab app is available on both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/MY/app/id647268330?mt=8">Apple AppStore</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger">Google PlayStore</a>.</p>
