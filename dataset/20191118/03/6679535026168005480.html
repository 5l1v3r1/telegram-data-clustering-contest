      <p>Construction for the phase II of the Metro rail project between Motera in Ahmedabad and Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar, covering a distance of 28.2-km, is expected to begin in June 2020 and get over by March 2024, officials said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Union Cabinet had in February this year approved phase II of the project connecting the twin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Sunday chaired a meeting to know the progress of the metro rail project.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) Managing Director, S.S. Rathod, informed him that tenders for extending the metro rail from Motera till Mahatma Mandir will be floated soon, a release issued by the state government said.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation of the project after inaugurating a 6.5-km stretch of phase I of the project during his visit in March this year.</p>
      <p>“Geotechnical investigation work related to the project was undertaken after its foundation-laying ceremony by the Prime Minister, for which the Centre approved the State’s request for ₹5,384.17 crore fund,” the release said.</p>
      <p>“Construction work for the project will begin in June 2020 and is expected to be completed by March 2024,” it said.</p>
      <p>The first phase of the project costs around ₹10,773 crore, for which Japan has extended a soft loan of ₹6,066 crore to the Indian government through its funding agency JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency).</p>
      <p>The Gujarat government and the Centre will each contribute ₹1,990 crore for the project.</p>
      <p>Phase I of the project covers a distance of 40.03 km, of which 6.5 km is underground and the rest of the stretch is elevated, and is expected to be fully operational by 2021.</p>
      <p>In February 2010, the State government had set up GMRC to implement the project.</p>
