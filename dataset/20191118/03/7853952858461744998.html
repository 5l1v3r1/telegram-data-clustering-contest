      <p>3. Books, newspapers, stationery and gifts</p>
      <p>4. Chinese drugs and herbs</p>
      <p>5. Medicines and cosmetics</p>
      <p>Retailers involved in these of business segments can apply for HK$60,000 grants, along with paperwork that includes Mandatory Provident Fund contributions statements. Those that cannot provide such statements and retailers who fall outside the five categories can apply for a lower amount of aid, at HK$30,000.</p>
      <p>Total amount of grants available will be HK$600 million under the second phase of the relief program from the Li charitable foundation. Only retail outlets having physical stores can apply for the grants.</p>

      <p>Online applications can be submitted from 9 am today, until 5 pm on Nov. 24. Successful applicants will receive the grants before mid-December, according to a statement from the foundation.</p>
      <p>Phase one of the program that targeted the food and beverage industry had received more than 10,000 applicants as of Sunday noon.</p>
      <p>As the eligible applications exceeded the quota of HK$200 million under that phase, the winners will be selected by computer randomly, and the money will be disbursed beginning Nov. 26.</p>
