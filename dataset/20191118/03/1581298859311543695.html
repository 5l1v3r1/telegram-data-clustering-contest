      <p>Over the next few weeks, the Esperance community has the opportunity to be transported to the bright and hilarious world of Sherwood Forest.</p>
      <p>Pantomime 'Robin Hood and the Babes in the Wood', directed by Kathleen Bowering, is showing at the Bijou Theatre on November 22 and 29 from 7.30pm and on November 23, 24 and 30 from 2pm.</p>
      <p>The opening night saw a full house enjoy the local production. Audiences of all ages were invited to play their part in the theatrical experience.</p>
      <p>The story sees Robin Hood and his band of merry men take on the 'bad to the bone' Sheriff of Nottingham.</p>
      <p>One highlight is Emma Field as Maid Marian. Emma especially captures the stage with a dance sequence that even has her lover Robin Hood confused.</p>
      <p>Michaela Maloney is wonderfully villainous as the sheriff and is well supported by her whiney sidekick Denis, featuring another standout performance from Stanley Halls.</p>
      <p>Derek Clarke and Vicky Williams are great comic reliefs as Winnie Widebottom, who even performs a striptease, and Friar Tuck, respectively.</p>
      <p>The production also features Julian Hockley in the titular role, Simon Ross as Alan-a-Dale and Mary McCulloch as Little Joan.</p>
      <p>The hard work of the 'Women of the Wardrobe' is on full display, with lavish and colourful costumes a feature of this production.</p>
      <p>The play also sees striking sets, visual effects, music and dance sequences, adding to the family fun.</p>
      <p>Robin Hood and the Babes was written by Ben Crocker.</p>
