      <h1>Video Of Dwayne Haskins Talking To His Linemen On Sideline Is Tough To Watch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:36:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>A disastrous season continued for the Washington Redskins on Sunday, as the NFC East basement dwellers were crushed at home by the New York Jets, 34-17.</p>
      <p>Ohio State rookie Dwayne Haskins started under center for the Redskins. He played OK, all things considered, throwing for 214 yards, two touchdowns and one interception.</p>
      <p>It’s been a long year for the Redskins and it doesn’t look like it’s going to get any easier.</p>
      <p>Video has surfaced of Haskins attempting to fire up his offensive linemen on the sideline during the game. It’s a tough watch.</p>
      <p>“What do I have to do to help you?” Haskins asks genuinely. “What do I have to do?”</p>

      <p>Washington’s veteran offensive linemen did not appear to be interested in answering that question.</p>

      <p>It’s always a delicate balance trying to lead veteran players when you’re a rookie. Haskins is clearly trying his best here. The Redskins’ offensive linemen just don’t seem to be having any of it.</p>
      <p>And it probably has nothing to do with the rookie quarterback. Washington is now 1-9 on the season. Hope appears to be getting lost (or gone altogether).</p>
