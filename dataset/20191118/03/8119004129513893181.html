        <b>Many consider onion as an essential component of tasty dishes in Bangladesh, but a number of families have been forced to cut the consumption of the aromatic flavourful vegetable due to high prices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the amount of onion in restaurants’ shopping lists have dropped, many retailers have stopped trading in it following the fall in sale and also fearing possible losses in case of a fall in price and the produces rotting.</p>
      <p>Taslima Begum, who cooks for three families in Mirpur’s Pirerbagh, said many in the neighbourhood have stopped consuming onion.</p>

      <p>“We’ve also cut onion consumption. I usually needed one kg to cook for three days, but now it has been 15 days since I bought one kg of onion. The lot appears useable for three more days,” she said.</p>
      <p>Babul Mia, the caretaker of a house in the area, cooks for himself only as his family do not live with him.</p>
      <p>Fond of onion, he generally used two onions to fry an egg.</p>
      <p>“Now I use half an onion to fry an egg in the morning and keep the rest to cook my lunch,” he told bdnews24.com.</p>

      <p>At Barabagh, grocer Ruhul Amin said he did not buy onion after his stocks exhausted four days ago as demand dropped sharply.</p>
      <p>People were asking for Tk 10 worth of onion while a single one would be costlier, according to him.</p>
      <p>Another shopkeeper is in fear of huge losses if his stocks of 50 kg of onion rotted or remained unsold before the price started to drop.</p>
      <p>He bought the lot at Tk 9,000 a week ago and could not sell 30 kg on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Grocer Al Amin claimed a fall in demand led the profits from onion sale remain the same or drop despite the price hike.</p>

      <p>Restaurateur Shafiqul Islam said: “Onion has become an essential part of the taste buds of the people of this region, including Bangladesh. A food can be eatable, but not much delicious without onion. Onion is a must for fish and meat recipes, biriyani and many other dishes.”</p>
      <p>His chefs were complaining as he had to cut onion purchase, he said and added his Shah Paran Restaurant is no more serving onion for salad free of cost.</p>
      <p>Ireen Sultana of Rupnagar, however, disagrees.</p>
      <p>Onion is not essential, not even for taste, in cooking, according to her.</p>
      <p>Considering the market situation, Ireen has started cooking without any onion.</p>
      <p>She says it is still possible to diversify recipes without onion.</p>
