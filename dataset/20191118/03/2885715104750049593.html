      <p>On Sunday, host <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a> evicted Arhaan Khan from Bigg Boss 13. The 31-year-old actor-entrepreneur entered the reality show as a wild card after the mid-season finale.</p>
      <p>This week, the nomination was part of a task. Two housemates had to convince each other to get nominated, so that the other gets immune. Arhaan was paired along with Asim Riaz. The two did not budge and so both eventually got nominated, which led to Arhaan’s elimination.</p>
      <p>While Arhaan entered the show with high hopes and big promises, his energy soon fizzled out. His biggest highlight in the journey was when he aced the captaincy task. The Badho Bahu actor was rumoured to be dating Rashami Desai, and fans were excited to see their chemistry. But the two kept their distance and apart from a couple of fights, the actors did not show any signs of being in love.</p>
      <p>Before entering the show, Arhaan Khan had opened up about his relationship with Rashami. In an exclusive interview with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>, Arhaan had shared, “It was all baseless rumours. We are just great friends and nothing else. Rashami has denied it and I am also saying that there is no truth to those stories. I am single. I am not in a mood to romance in the show. There is no one who seems interesting. I am only going on the show to entertain the audience.”</p>
      <p>He added, “I am not on Bigg Boss for Rashami and neither does she need me. We both are strong players in our own place. Rashami is an independent woman and she needs no support. I hope we both have a good stint on the show.”</p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 airs Monday-Friday at 10:30 pm and on Weekends at 9 pm on Colors.</p>
