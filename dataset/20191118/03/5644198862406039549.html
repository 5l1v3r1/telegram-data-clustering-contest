      <p>England secured a place among the top six seeds for next year’s European Championship after three late goals helped them to a 4-0 win in Kosovo in their final qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>PRISTINA: England secured a place among the top six seeds for next year’s European Championship after three late goals helped them to a 4-0 win in Kosovo in their final qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>England, already assured of a place at the finals, finished top of Group A with 21 points from eight games, their only blip being last month’s 2-1 defeat in the Czech Republic, who have qualified as runners-up.</p>

      <p>In a subdued and sloppy first half England found a way through only once, when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slipped a pass for Harry Winks to tuck home his first international goal after 32 minutes.</p>
      <p>Captain Harry Kane then struck his 12th goal of the campaign in the 79th minute, Marcus Rashford added the third with a neat finish four minutes later and Mason Mount completed the scoring in stoppage time to give some gloss to the scoreline.</p>
      <p>Kosovo finished third on 11 points. Their chances of automatic qualification disappeared after a 2-1 defeat by the Czechs on Thursday but they could advance via the playoffs.</p>
