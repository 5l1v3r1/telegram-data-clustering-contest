      <h3>‘World’s Most Beautiful Girl’ Thylane Blondeau Has A Juul In Fresh-Faced Selfie, And Fans Are Not Happy</h3>
      <p>

      <p>French bombshell <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/thylane-blondeau/">Thylane Blondeau</a>, who was once dubbed the “most beautiful girl in the world,” stunned her fans with a new selfie in which she wore ripped jeans and no makeup. However, fans quickly took umbrage to the fact that she was holding a Juul electronic cigarette in her hand.</p>
      <p>The model looked fresh-faced in her latest shot, letting her natural beauty shine through. Her hair was pulled back and seemed slightly damp. A number of escaped wisps of hair beautifully framed her face.</p>
      <p>The natural look could be because the stunner was getting ready for a photoshoot, as she took the selfie in a mirror on top of a vanity. Several beauty products — including hair spray and beige nail polish — were visible in the reflection.</p>
      <p>For her attire, Thylane wore a black and white patterned short-sleeve collared shirt. The image on the shirt appeared to be inspired by natural landscapes and included the image of lion, a cactus, a mountain range shrouded in clouds and leaves. A bright orange ribbon, the only pop of color in the ensemble, hung from the hem.</p>
      <p>Thylane completed the look with a pair of faded black skinny jeans. The jeans featured a tear at her left knee, exposing some leg to the camera.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the monochromatic color scheme, her iPhone case was a gunmetal grey color.</p>

      <p>The snapshot earned over 77,000 likes in under 24 hours, in addition to a number of glowing compliments.</p>
      <p>“This look is so you… love it,” raved a fan, adding several red hearts.</p>
      <p>“You’re such a magnificent person, Thylane, you’re unreal,” sweetly added another.</p>
      <p>However, some eagle-eyed fans spotted a Juul in Thylane’s right hand and quickly voiced their disappointment.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5652223/juul-criminal-probe-california/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, the vaping device has been allegedly causing illness and even death, particularly among teenagers. It is the subject of an FBI criminal probe.</p>

      <p>The fact that Thylane has a social media following of over 3.2 million fans means that the brunette beauty has a large platform, and users scolded the model for appearing to promote the potentially dangerous product.</p>
      <p>“Hope you’re not vaping,” wrote in one fan, with a tearful emoji face.</p>
      <p>“Oh my God, stop with the Juul,” echoed another disgruntled follower.</p>
      <p>Thylane’s comment feed was peppered with even more comments that slammed her vaping habits. At the time of writing, she hadn’t replied to any of them.</p>
      <p>The return to her modeling gigs comes after Thylane took several days off to spend time at Disneyland Paris. As previously covered by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5737816/thylane-blondeau-kiss-disneyland/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, the brunette beauty received a magical kiss in the most picture-perfect location.</p>
