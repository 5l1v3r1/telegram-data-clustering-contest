      <p>Two staff members of an event management firm were arrested for allegedly showing nude photographs to a 19-year-old girl, the Mumbai Police said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>A Nehru Nagar police station official identified them as Sanjay Kumar Gupta (42) and Sachin Kadam (35), residents of Kalyan and Andheri.</p>
      <p>“The victim is also an event management professional from Navi Mumbai. She was told by a friend to meet Mr. Gupta for help in expanding her business,” he said. Mr. Gupta called the girl to Kurla railway station on Friday where the two were joined by Mr. Kadam.</p>
      <p>“Gupta and Kadam showed her a nude photograph and indulged in obscene talk, asking her to take part in a nude event. The victim called her parents who arrived there, beat up the two men and handed them over to the police,” the official said.</p>
      <p>Both have been charged under Sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 354A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code, Nehru Nagar senior inspector Vilas Shinde said.</p>
