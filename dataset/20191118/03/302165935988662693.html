      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 18 — Ariana Grande is feeling devastated after being forced to cancel a concert due to her current health situation.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Grande had to her cancel her concert in Lexington, Kentucky and she took to Instagram to give her fans an update on her ailment.</p>
      <p>“Okay, so I woke up kind of ten times worse and it hurts so bad to swallow. I’m not really sure what’s going on, but I unfortunately don’t think I will be able to push through tonight and I’m so upset and sorry,” Grande explained in an Instagram Story, while trying to hold back tears.</p>
      <p>“I am so sad and sorry. I’m so upset but of course obviously, you will be refunded. I’m just really devastated... Thank you for understanding and sending love... I will keep you posted as soon as I know what is going on with my body. Thank you for understanding and I am so sorry.”</p>
      <p>Grande also took to social media earlier on Saturday to open up about her health situation saying: “Hi my loves, so I’m still very sick. I’ve been sick since the last London show. I don’t know how it’s possible but my throat and head are still in so much pain. I sound okay I’m just in a lot of pain and it’s difficult to breathe during the show.</p>
      <p>“I am seeing my doctor and trying my v best to get better for tomorrow’s show. The last thing I would ever want to do is cancel a show at this point with so few left. I’m truly cherishing every moment of this I just really don’t know what’s happening with my body right now and need to figure it out. I don’t want anyone to feel blindsided tomorrow if god forbid I can’t make the show happen.</p>
      <p>“I’m on all the meds. Getting IV drips, doing everything I possibly can to pull through. Mum and friends are taking good care of me. just a scary feeling. Love you with all my heart and will keep you posted,” she concluded.</p>
      <p>The concert in Kentucky was part of Grande’s Sweetener World Tour, which continues until the end of the year.</p>
