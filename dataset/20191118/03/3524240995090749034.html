      <p> Air Peace and Brazilian aerospace conglomerate, Embraer, have signed a contract for three additional E195-E2 confirming purchase rights from the original contract, signed in April this year.</p>
      <p>With the new signing at the Dubai Airshow, Air Peace has made a total firm order of 13 E195-E2s with 17 purchase rights for the same model, whose delivery would begin in May 2020.</p>
      <p>The airline said on Sunday that the new E195-E2s with a value of $212.6m, based on Embraer’s current list prices, would be included in Embraer’s 2019 fourth-quarter backlog.</p>
      <p>Air Peace said the new aircraft would have dual configurations with 12-seater business class and 102-seater economy class.</p>
      <p>“The aircraft also comes in single configuration of all economy class of 144 seats,” the airline said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Air Peace Chief of Finance and Administration, Mrs Ejiroghene Eghagha, who signed the new deal on behalf of the airline, was quoted as saying the E195-E2 was the perfect aircraft to expand the carrier’s domestic and regional operations.</p>
      <p>She said, “The new deliveries will ease our subsidiary fleet in the Air Peace Hopper to actualise our ‘no-city-left-behind initiative which we shall continue to execute.</p>
      <p>“We are receiving impressive data about the aircraft’s economics when in revenue service, and this was a driver to place this new firm order with Embraer. We look forward to receiving our first aircraft, which will enhance connectivity in Nigeria and the African region.”</p>
      <p>She said the new order would gradually replace the airline’s existing fleet, which would make it the airline with the youngest fleet in the world.</p>
