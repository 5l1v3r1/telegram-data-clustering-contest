      <p>Returning <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/john-barrowman">John Barrowman</a> fears the I'm A Celeb camp-mates may not be as relatable as in past years.</p>
      <p>The 2018 contestant says they will need to show viewers real character after settling in.</p>
      <p>New Dancing On Ice judge John is a life-long fan of the show and came third last year.</p>
      <p>Now he wants to see more of the stars and hope they will open up in Snake Rock.</p>
      <p>"I think we need to experience them, I don't really want to say more relatable?" he asked on Extra Camp.</p>

      <p>"Maybe a little more vulnerable - sometimes they are a little shy, maybe too strong.</p>
      <p>"I would like to see them out of their comfort-zone, maybe some more tears."</p>
      <p>The actor worried his fans after his appearance on the sofa.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old looked almost unrecognisable as he sported shaved gray hair on the ITV2 spin-off show.</p>
