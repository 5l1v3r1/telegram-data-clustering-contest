      <h1>A Tiny Yoda Has Become A Huge Meme</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:22:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:22</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/mandalorian-reviews/229382">The first few episodes of Star Wars saga <i>The Mandalorian</i> have gotten fairly mixed reviews.</a> But one character has emerged head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
      <p>
        <b><i>Spoilers for the first episode of</i> The Mandalorian<i> follow.</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>See, the show’s pilot follows the titular bounty hunter as he tracks down a package about which he knows very little — only that it’s “50 years old” and extremely important.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, the package is a tiny, aggressively cute green thing with long, bat-like ears.</p>
      <p>So, a baby Yoda.</p>

      <p>Of course, it’s not actually Yoda. <i>The Mandalorian</i> is set a few years after the end of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, so Yoda is well dead by this stage. Instead, the baby’s a youngling from the same species as the ancient space wizard (unless the show’s setting up the idea that Yoda regenerates into a new body after death, which like, phew.)</p>
      <p>But who cares about technicalities? All that matters is that Baby Yoda is extremely cute, and has been widely embraced by the internet at large, and Twitter in particular.</p>

      <p>In fact, Baby Yoda is so popular that they’ve been mashed into a number of different trends, ranging from the hugely popular Pikachu memes that floated around for a while this year…</p>

      <p>…to, uh, the “suicide” of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>And it’s not just random internet commentators getting excited about this tiny green guy. Werner Herzog, one of the most acclaimed and serious filmmakers of all time, who stars in the series as a nefarious villain, says he was overwhelmed with emotion when he first clapped eyes on the character.</p>
      <p>“I saw two technicians operating it remote,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/werner-herzog-on-baby-yoda-in-star-wars-the-mandalorian.html">Herzog said in an interview</a>. “One was for the eyes and the mouth, and the other one was for other facial expressions. It’s a phenomenal technical achievement and beyond the technological achievement, it’s heartbreaking.”</p>
      <p>And he isn’t being poetic when he says ‘heartbreaking’. He means it very literally.</p>
      <p>“On the set, it looked absolutely convincing,” Herzog said. “It made you cry when you saw it.”</p>
