      <p>Samoa has reported more than 700 cases across all areas of the country, prompting the government on Friday to invoke emergency powers. <br/><br/>Declaring a state of emergency, the government said plans for compulsory <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/measles-cases-triple-world-warns-190813142655803.html">measles</a>, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisations would be published on Monday. <br/><br/>"MMR vaccinations for members of the public who have not yet received a vaccination injection is now a mandatory legal requirement for all of Samoa," it said. <br/><br/>A national emergency operations centre to coordinate the measles response was opened on Monday.</p>
      <p>However, no information was immediately available on how the vaccinations would be administered or whether those who were not immunised would face sanctions.</p>
      <h3>Measles resurgent</h3>
      <p>Children are the most vulnerable to measles, which typically causes a rash and fever but can also lead to blindness, brain damage and death. <br/><br/>Samoa has closed all schools, kindergartens and the country's only university in a bid to halt the virus' spread. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/new-zealand.html">New Zealand</a>, which is experiencing its own measles outbreak in the Auckland region, will this week send 12 nurses and 3,000 MMR doses to assist Samoa's public health response. <br/><br/>University of Auckland immunologist Helen Petousis-Harris said even though measles was already widespread, the mass rollout of vaccinations could help limit the number of cases and reduce the death toll. <br/><br/>She said it was also important to boost Samoa's low levels of immunisation and help prevent future outbreaks. <br/><br/>"In Samoa, the proportion of people who are immune to measles is very, very low, one of the lowest in the world," she told AFP. <br/><br/>"So if they aren't able to improve that, this is going to happen again." <br/><br/>The country's vaccination programme was briefly suspended last year when two babies died shortly after being given the MMR vaccine. <br/><br/>Subsequent investigations found the problem was not the widely-used vaccine but the fact that the nurses administering prepared it incorrectly. <br/><br/>Neighbouring Tonga last week announced government primary schools and kindergartens would be closed until later this month as the number of measles cases in the kingdom approaches 200. <br/><br/>Fiji has reported four cases but says they are contained to a township west of the capital Suva.</p>
