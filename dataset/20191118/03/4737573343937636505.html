      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A leading research institution in Taiwan has developed a genome editing method capable of helping rice adapt to environmental changes caused by increasingly frequent, extreme weather events.</p>
      <p>A study by <a href="https://www.sinica.edu.tw/ch/news/6400">Academia Sinica</a> is said to have discovered the secret to controlling glucose levels in plants, including rice, a staple in many countries. Like humans, plants need a balanced glucose mechanism to grow strong, said the government-sponsored research institution.</p>
      <p>The key lies in the technique to manage αAmy levels, which is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into sugars and thus affects glucose concentrations in rice. With this technological breakthrough, rice production is expected to increase by a factor of 1.5 times — even as as the food supply is disrupted due to water shortages and droughts, reported <a href="https://technews.tw/2019/11/15/mybs2-%CE%B1amy-mybs1-gf14-rice-gene-editing/">TechNews</a>.</p>
      <p>Improved rice cultivation will help address an alarming global food crisis as the output of the world’s four major staple foods — corn, rice, wheat, and soy beans — have dwindled since 2010, wrote the report. The aim is to boost crop production by 60 percent by 2050, when the planet's population is set to reach 9 billion, said Yu Su-may (余淑美), a researcher involved in the study at the Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica.</p>
      <p>A patent application for the innovation has been filed in the United States. The study was published in PNAS Plus in October, according to PNAS Plus.</p>
