      <p>Among those in custody are the Council Chairman, Hon Ebinyon Turner;  two lawmakers, Hon Gibson Munalayefa and Mrs. Naomi Ogoli.</p>
      <p>Cleopas lamented that while PDP members were being arrested and taken to unknown destination, the election results for Ogbia were also being rewritten.</p>
      <p>The PDP chairman wondered why the Nigerian Army would allow itself to be used as a tool to subvert democracy in the country.</p>
      <p>He said that the PDP had already won the election with the original results from the polling units where proper voting took place on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He urged the observers to note the brazen acts of impunity by the Army to rig the election and subvert the will of the Bayelsa people.</p>
