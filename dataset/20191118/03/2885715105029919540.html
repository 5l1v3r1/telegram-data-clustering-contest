      <p>A 32-year-old security guard was charred to death after a fire broke out inside a shoe factory in Narela early Sunday morning. An eyewitness told Delhi Fire Services that another worker was in the building, but rescuers are yet to find him.</p>
      <p>“We received the call around 12.45 am. The factory is a four-storeyed building. The fire started from the ground floor and spread to the other floors. We deployed 24 fire tenders and started dousing the fire on the ground floor and broke windows to let out the smoke. We were able to control the fire within an hour and began cooling operations. Around 4.45 am, a man’s body was found on the top floor,” said Atul Garg, DFS chief.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.</p>
      <p>The victim, Mangal Mandal, worked in the night shift and would guard the factory from inside. Police said the factory was closed for the weekend.</p>
      <p>“Mandal was found near the stairs on the top floor. We suspect he was trying to escape but got stuck due to smoke from the raw material in the factory,” Garg said.</p>
      <p>Kanti Ram (55), an eyewitness who works at a cable shop nearby, claimed he saw Mandal and another man going inside the factory at 10 pm. Firefighters and police are looking for the other man.</p>
      <p>“Factory owner Parveen Kumar said only the guard was supposed to be inside the building. We are checking if there was another man inside,” said Gaurav Sharma, DCP (Outer North).</p>
