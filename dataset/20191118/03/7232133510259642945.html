      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Recently, Ethereum found a strong buying interest near the $178 level against the US Dollar. As a result, ETH price started an upward move above the $180 and $182 levels.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the price broke the $185 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the upward move was capped by the $186 resistance area. A high was formed near $186 and the price is currently correcting lower.</p>
      <p>It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $177 low to $186 high. At the moment, the price is trading near the $184 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>An immediate support is near the $182 level. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $177 low to $186 high is also near the $182 level. The main support is near the $180 level, below which the price is likely to revisit the $178 support area.</p>
      <p>On the upside, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/17/ethereum-eth-price-weekly-forecast-crucial-support-at-risk/">Ethereum price is still struggling</a> to climb above $186, $188 and $190 resistances. More importantly, there are two major bearish trend lines forming with resistance near $186 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>If there is a clear break above both the trend lines, the price is likely to make an attempt to surpass the $188 resistance area. Having said that, a clear break and close above the $190 resistance is needed for a sustained move higher in the near term.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is somehow holding the $180 and $178 levels. On the other hand, bitcoin is declining and it even traded below the $8,500 support level. Therefore, there are high chances of a decent upward move as long as ETH price is trading above the $180 and $178 support levels.</p>
