      <h1>Harry Styles Tells Nick Jonas To 'Wreck Me Daddy' In Thirstiest 'SNL' Sketch Ever</h1>
      <h2>The singer played a rogue social media manager with a thing for graphic Instagram comments.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:31:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author">Cole Delbyck, HuffPost US</a></address>
      <p>To stand out on social media these days, brands have to establish a personality online ― think Merriam-Webster trolling President Donald Trump or Wendy’s almost constant snark on your timeline. </p>
      <p>But with the Instagram password comes great responsibility, something <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entertainment/topic/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a>’ rogue social media manager on “<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entertainment/topic/snl">Saturday Night Live</a>” is clearly not ready to handle. </p>
      <p>The singer returned to Studio 8H over the weekend, pulling <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/harry-styles-snl-zayn-malik-watermelon-sugar_n_5dd0edf1e4b0294748189e24">double duty as host and musical guest</a>, but he’ll likely be remembered for what ranks as perhaps the thirstiest sketch to date, simply titled “Sara Lee.”</p>
      <p>In the scene, Styles is called into a meeting at the baking company with his two bosses played by Cecily Strong and Bowen Yang after they discover some “off-message” activity on the brand’s social media. </p>

      <p>It turns out, Styles’ character has been using Sara Lee’s Instagram as his own personal account, commenting under a picture of Nick Jonas with things like “Wreck me daddy” and “Destroy me king.”</p>
      <p>And his captions on the company’s page aren’t much better. In one post, Styles’ social media manager reflected about post-threesome regrets alongside a photo of grilled cheese, which he admittedly wrote “at 4 in the morning while he was still on a poppers high.”</p>
      <p>“Why do guys freak out when I ask them to spit in my mouth? Need a real king that can handle,” a different caption reads. “It’s 8 am and have to go to hell job at Sara Lee. A little in my head after another threesome.”</p>
      <p>But Styles’ character’s greatest offense was DM-ing Shawn Mendes a picture of his “open throat” under the guise of a holiday promotion. </p>
      <p>In completely unrelated news, we’re now following Sara Lee on Instagram. </p>
