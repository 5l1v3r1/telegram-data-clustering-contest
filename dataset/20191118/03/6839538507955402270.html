      <p>Malcolm Turnbull has lashed his colleagues who ousted him, and made a huge claim in a revealing interview with Christopher Pyne.</p>
      <p>Retired cabinet minister Christopher Pyne asked his close friend and former boss if he would have won this year’s election had he not been dethroned.</p>
      <p>“Oh yeah. Absolutely. There’s not many people that doubt that,” Mr Turnbull told the <i>Pyne Time</i> podcast.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who took over after the leadership spill, backed his predecessor’s assessment of his election chances.</p>
      <p>“I said at the time of the change that I believed he would too,” he told reporters in Adelaide on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mr Turnbull had a blunt message for the Liberal insurgency which tried to install Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton as prime minister before Mr Morrison rose to power.</p>
      <p>“They didn’t get the outcome they wanted. Quite a lot of them would have found Morrison even less palatable than me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They ended up with Morrison. They didn’t get Dutton, which is what they wanted.”</p>
      <p>Mr Turnbull poured cold water on suggestions he should have put long-time rival Tony Abbott in cabinet to stop him from damaging the government.</p>
      <p>“Nobody thought that was a good idea, except for him obviously and a couple of others,” he said.</p>
      <p>On his achievements as prime minister, Mr Turnbull nominated legislating same-sex marriage after the postal vote among his biggest.</p>
      <p>“I looked at the arguments against it and they are bonkers,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The idea that my marriage to Lucy of nearly than 40 years is threatened by the gay couple around the corner deciding to get married, it is laughable.”</p>
      <p>He conceded the debate surrounding the plebiscite was hurtful and tough for some, but the emphatic ‘yes’ victory was a proud moment for Australia.</p>
      <p>“If you were a young kid troubled about your sexual identity, that plebiscite says nearly two-thirds of Australians are saying to you ‘we’re cool, we love you’,” Mr Turnbull said.</p>
