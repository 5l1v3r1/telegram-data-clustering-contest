      <p>Biden argued that there isn't enough science to determine whether or not the substance leads to harder drug use and said it's up to states to decided laws around it.</p>
      <p>At a Las Vegas, Nevada town hall event on Saturday, former vice president and current 2020 Democratic hopeful <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a> told a crowd of supporters that he’s still not ready to legalize marijuana on a federal level, citing the lack of sufficient evidence to prove that it’s not a gateway drug.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug-but-research-doesnt-support-that-2019-11/?utm_source=reddit.com"><i>Business Insider</i></a>, the question on whether or not Biden would legalize the drug, should he win the presidency in 2020, comes at a time when most of his 2020 Democratic opponents fully support the national legalization of marijuana, which matches a growing number of states making the drug medically legal and cleared for recreational use.</p>
      <p>“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden said.</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”</blockquote>
      <p>Biden did make it clear that he backs the usage of marijuana in medical cases, and he also stated that marijuana laws should be a state-level decision. Though he’s not ready to make it legal on a federal level, he also remarked that he doesn’t think possessing the drug should equal a crime.</p>
      <p>The former vice president is banking on science to eventually determine whether or not the substance can lead someone to use harder drugs.</p>
      <p>“It is not irrational to do more scientific investigation to determine, which we have not done significantly enough, whether or not there are any things that relate to whether it’s a gateway drug or not,” Biden said at the event.</p>

      <p>As <i>Business Insider</i> reported, Biden’s campaign has at least partially focused on reformed policies for the criminal justice system to fix “the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system.” His plan includes the possible expunging of the records of people previously convicted of non-violent, marijuana-related crimes.</p>
      <p>Research from the <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> concluded that marijuana usage doesn’t lead to hard drug use and points out that drug use can be triggered by a variety of factors. A 1999 study from the <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/6376/chapter/1">Institute of Medicine</a> also said that while marijuana “does not appear” to be a predictor of whether or not an individual will graduate to harder drug use.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5622557/heres-where-the-2020-democratic-and-republican-presidential-candidates-stand-on-marijuana-legalization/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported, several of Biden’s opponents, who happen to be U.S. senators, have already co-sponsored legislation that would remove marijuana from the government’s Schedule I list of illegal drugs and it would include expunging records of those with marijuana-related crimes. The bill will also create a fund to offer support for American communities who were hardest hit by the government’s War on Drugs.</p>
