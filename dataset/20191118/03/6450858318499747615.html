      <p>Twelve South is a great company that focuses on premium Apple accessories. Its most famous product is the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778001-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Faudio%2Ftwelve-south-airfly-pro-solves-modern-audio-problem-3778001%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Fbookbook-iphone%3Fvariant%3D18684425994297">BookBook folio case</a> that turns your iPhone into a leather bound book.</p>
      <p>That aesthetic isn’t for everyone, but the company’s new product might appeal to more of us.</p>
      <p>Now that many people have AirPods and other kinds of wireless headphones, it’s harder to share audio. No more one earphone each on the bus to listen to the new Fall Out Boy album, and no more headphone splitters on aeroplanes.</p>
      <p>The Twelve South <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778001-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Faudio%2Ftwelve-south-airfly-pro-solves-modern-audio-problem-3778001%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Fairfly%3Fvariant%3D30720749109305">AirFly Pro</a> solves these conundrums with a wireless audio splitter. The device plugs into a 3.5mm headphone jack and can output the audio to one or two sets of wireless headphones.</p>
      <p>It means you can watch in-flight entertainment cable free on any wireless headphones, not just Apple’s AirPods. Twelve South also makes a USB-C version if you want to transmit from a device that uses USB-C audio instead of a headphone jack.</p>
      <p>At <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778001-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Faudio%2Ftwelve-south-airfly-pro-solves-modern-audio-problem-3778001%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Fairfly%3Fvariant%3D30720749109305">£49/$55</a> it’s another cost for a perhaps limited use case, but if you fly regularly it could well be a no-brainer purchase. Even if you don’t want to connect to the in-flight entertainment, you and your travelling partner can wirelessly listen into the same podcast or film from one device.</p>
      <p>Apple Stores worldwide stock it too, so you can be sure of its quality. It’s not an accessory everyone will need, but it sure does hit a niche.</p>
