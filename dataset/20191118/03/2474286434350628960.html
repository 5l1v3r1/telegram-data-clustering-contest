      <h1>Moree Secondary College student Alyssa Duncan wins Rotary District 9650 public speaking cluster final</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:13:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:13</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Harris</a></address>
      <p>Moree Secondary College student Alyssa Duncan has progressed to the next level of the Rotary District 9650 public speaking competition, after winning the cluster final at Warialda earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The year 11 student, representing Moree Rotary Club, was one of four speakers at the cluster final, including fellow Moree Secondary College student Grace Carter, who represented Moree-on-Gwydir Rotary Club.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6462894/alyssa-and-grace-talk-their-way-to-regional-public-speaking-competition/">Moree students progressed to the cluster final after winning their respective club competitions</a>.</p>
      <p>However it was Alyssa's well-delivered speech about passions which won over the judges.</p>
      <p>"I was ecstatic," she said of the win.</p>
      <p>"It was so cool.</p>
      <p>"It was a shock - I didn't expect it at all. Initially I didn't feel confident; the speech fell quite short and was fairly rushed, but I think it was my delivery of it that got me through."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Grace came second in the competition, with her speech about technology and its impact on society. However only one person could progress through to the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy with how I spoke - I did my best," Grace said.</p>
      <p>"I'm not too worried [about not going further]. I know Alyssa has worked hard to improve since the first one."</p>
      <p>Alyssa will now go on to compete at the District semi-finals, to be held in Walcha in February 2020.</p>
      <p>"I'm really nervous for that," she said.</p>
