      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>The federal government has decided to take steps to ensure the implementation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) action plan and to curb smuggling. The steps include establishment of crossing point task forces at national, provincial and divisional levels and purchases of motorcycles, arms, bulletproof jackets and spy dogs for border management initiatives (BMI). A directorate-general of law and prosecution will also be set up to take action against smugglers under BMIs.</p>
      <p>Targets have been set for the Ministries of Interior, Law and Justice, Defence and Finance as well as the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in a meeting of the anti-smuggling steering committee presided over by the prime minister, and they have been directed to ensure their achievement.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Interior has sent details of decisions taken in the meeting to all relevant ministries and divisions. These details include a list of all the committees for different tasks, the name of the leading institution and names of the institutions and members in the committees.</p>
      <p>According to a document available with <i>The Express Tribune</i>, crossing point task forces at national, provincial and divisional levels will be set up in three to six months to curb smuggling.</p>
      <p>A special committee led by interior ministry authorities has also been set up which includes members from the FBR, the Ministries of Commerce, Narcotics Control, National Food Security and Research, Maritime Affairs and Law and Justice, and the Intelligence Bureau. The provincial and Gilgit-Baltistan chief secretaries are also part of the committee.</p>
      <p>According to the document, the committee has been assigned the task of planning crossing point task forces. The number of staff for customs border management initiatives will be increased which has been approved much earlier. The committee has been directed to achieve the task immediately. Equipment and logistics for the BMIs are to be purchased immediately, double cabin and coaster vehicles will be purchased from the budget allocated in the next fiscal year 2020-21 and motorcycles will be purchased from the funds available now. The document also states that FBR will purchase arms, bullet proof jackets and spy dogs needed to strengthen border management forces from its own resources.</p>
      <p>The document further mentions that a subcommittee, to be headed by the FBR, has been approved to finalise technology and set priorities for technical equipment for all agencies and their purchase. The other members of this committee will be from the Ministries of Interior, Information Technology and Finance. The FBR’s Customs Department will be the convener of the committee. Former military operations and NRTC officers will also be included in the committee.</p>
      <p>According to the document, the committee will study border management and equipment being used in different countries to stop smuggling as well as modern-day training needed for Customs officers.</p>
