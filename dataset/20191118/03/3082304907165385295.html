        <b>Unai Emery’s second season at Arsenal is slowly turning into a disaster. The Spanish football coach has lost much of the fan support following questionable team selection and poor results. A new report now claims that Emery has been given a deadline to save his job although fears over the bigger picture remain. </b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-month-save-job-20895792?2">Mirror</a>, Unai Emery has one month to save his Arsenal job. The Gunners are in a poor spell at the moment and are without a league win in since mid-October, having lost two and drawn two in the same period. However, there is further fear inside the club that the legacy Arsene Wenger left behind has already been tarnished.</p>
      <p>Mirror quoted one source who voiced his concerns regarding the club’s loss of identity, following a spell of disastrous appointments and personnel changes.</p>
      <p>“The DNA that made ­Arsenal the club it was has slowly but surely drained away,” the source said.</p>
      <p>“Appointments have been made – both before and after Wenger’s departure – that either didn’t work out or aren’t working out. Long-serving members of staff have been shocked by what’s ­happening to the club.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal next face struggling Southampton in the Premier League, with both teams in need of a win.</p>
