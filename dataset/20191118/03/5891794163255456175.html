      <h1>Protesters In Russia's Kalmykia Voice Anger Over Mayor's Appointment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:14:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:14</time> by <a rel="author">RFE/RL's Russian Service</a></address>
      <p>Demonstrators for the fifth time in three months have rallied in Elista, the capital of Russia’s southwestern region of Kalmykia, to protest the appointment of a former leader of Kremlin-backed separatists as the city's acting mayor.<br/><br/>Some 2,000 protesters on November 17 assembled on Victory Square in the city of about 100,000 where police didn't allow them to unfurl banners despite organizers having received a permit for the action.<br/><br/>As in earlier rallies, protesters demanded the resignation of Dmitry Trapeznikov, 38, and for changes to legislation so that the mayor gets elected locally in municipal elections.<br/><br/>Before his appointment on September 26, Trapeznikov had last year briefly ruled territories in Ukraine's Donetsk region that the government in Kyiv doesn't control.<br/><br/>His predecessor in the Donbas, Ukrainian Aleksandr Zakharchenko, was assassinated in August 2018.<br/><br/>Trapeznikov was born in the Russian city of Krasnodar but grew up in the eastern Ukrainian industrial city of Donetsk.<br/><br/>He claims no roots in Kalmykia, a region east of Krasnodar and close to the North Caucasus in which a majority of the population belongs to a Mongol-speaking, predominantly Buddhist ethnic group<br/><br/>Some local residents have rejected Trapeznikov's appointment, often pointing to the destruction that the Donbas war has caused in eastern Ukraine since Moscow-backed separatists took up arms against Kyiv in April 2014.<br/><br/>Others are angered that an outsider who knows little about the region was forced upon them as mayor.<br/><br/>The head of Kalmykia, Batu Khasikov, has defended the Donbas war veteran's appointment, saying he has an abundance of experience, and has called him a "crisis manager."<br/><br/>On the day of Trapeznikov's appointment, a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin who is reported to have oversight over the Donbas conflict, congratulated him.<br/><br/>“I am glad and proud that our Donetsk cadres are in demand. I wish you success,” said Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov in a congratulatory note.<br/><br/>More than 13,000 people have died in the conflict in Ukraine and 1.5 million more have been uprooted from their homes.</p>
