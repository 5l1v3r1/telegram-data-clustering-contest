      <p>New Delhi: If ever there is an issue concerning India, Prasar Bharati will definitely take “a strong stand in national interest”, CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati told ET, adding that the national broadcaster was “well within its mandate to do so,” particularly “when public broadcasters and news channels across the world are taking editorial positions on matters that concern India’s territorial integrity.”</p>
      <p>This comes at a time when the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> handle of the broadcaster's news service for some days has been creating a sensation, leading to a criticism that it was violating the principle of neutrality in reporting.</p>
      <p>Recently, on Twitter, the Prasar Bharati news service, a recently launched digital arm of the broadcaster, warned the Guardian against “provoking communal hatred in India” before the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayodhya-verdict">Ayodhya verdict</a>.</p>
      <p>In another instance, it referred to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, as the “troll PM of Terroristan” after India's rebuttal to his speech at the UN, and rebuked China’s Global Times that said India's position on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/RCEP">RCEP</a> was inconsistent.</p>
      <p>Last month, it also took on Reuters that said India had “held off” imposing a blanket ban on single-use plastic as it was not able to cope with the economic slowdown and job losses. The broadcaster called the story fake news, and accused the report of being reflective of ‘polemical approach’ of the global agency.</p>
      <p>Vempati said, ‘there was now a sharper focus in the national broadcaster's news strategy on national interest in response to global media coverage of India.’ ‘There is no question of maintaining neutrality on issues concerning India and her territorial integrity,’ he added.</p>
      <p>‘The guardian article was particularly attributing motives to the judiciary. There was an FT article which said India was getting a free pass. If international media is trying to run down India, Prasar Bharati as India's global voice has to respond strongly. We are the largest democracy and why should we take things lying down,’ Vempati said.</p>
      <p>An editorial team comprising senior professionals from TV and radio decide these positions and review them periodically, he said, adding. ‘If defending national interest is violating the Act, one must remember the parliament would have never passed such an act. In fact section 12(2) of the Act begins with Unity and Integrity of the country.’</p>
