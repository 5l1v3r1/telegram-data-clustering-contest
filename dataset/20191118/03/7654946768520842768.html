      <p>An inmate serving 25 years to life for murder who says he was convicted on a confession ginned up by disgraced former NYPD Detective Louis Scarcella is about to have his conviction tossed, his lawyer told The Post.</p>
      <p>Eliseo DeLeon, 42, will have his 1996 murder conviction thrown out this week by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Dena Douglas over concerns about the investigation by Scarcella, according to attorney Cary London.</p>
      <p>He may not be out of the woods just yet, however, as his indictment would still be in effect, and Kings County prosecutors could elect to re-try him if they feel they can still build a case without Scarcella’s evidence.</p>
      <p>DeLeon was convicted of killing Fausto Cordero during a botched robbery attempt in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill neighborhood — in part on the strength of a confession he purportedly gave to Scarcella, Scarcella’s partner and a third detective.</p>
      <p>In that statement, DeLeon supposedly said that his gun went off as Cordero made a desperate grab for the piece, sending a round into Cordero’s stomach.</p>
      <p>But DeLeon has maintained his innocence, and insisted that the admission was entirely fabricated by Scarcella.</p>
      <p>Scarcella was once considered a hard-nosed star detective, patrolling some of the city’s toughest blocks alongside partner Stephen Chmil in the crime-ridden 1980s and ’90s.</p>
      <p>But in recent years, Brooklyn <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/05/08/disgraced-cop-blames-ex-da-for-wrongful-convictions/">judges have tossed at least 14 convictions</a> on cases worked by Scarcella over troubling statements about his policing tactics — some from his own mouth.</p>
      <p>“I lied to [suspects]. I used deception,” said Scarcella in a 2007 appearance on TV’s “Dr. Phil,” which was referenced by London during DeLeon’s case. “I don’t play by the rules.”</p>
      <p>During recent testimony on the revived DeLeon case, however, Scarcella adamantly denied that he fabricated the convicted killer’s confession.</p>
      <p>During the same hearings, Chmil acknowledged <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/10/louis-scarcellas-partner-admits-they-used-questionable-tactics/">using “some questionable tactics”</a> during his work with Scarcella, but flatly denied doing anything illegal.</p>
      <p>Eight of the Scarcella-aided convictions that were overturned, were reversed with the backing of the Brooklyn DA’s Conviction Review Unit.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor’s office declined to comment, and a message left at Justice Douglas’s chambers was not returned.</p>
      <p>Scarcella — who has consistently defended his record — declined to comment, while Chmil did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
