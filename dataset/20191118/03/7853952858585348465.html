      <p>China’s central bank unexpectedly trimmed a key interbank lending rate on Monday, the first easing in the liquidity tool in more than four years and a signal to markets that policymakers are ready to act to prop up slowing growth, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) said on its website that it was lowering the seven-day reverse repurchase rate to 2.50 percent from 2.55 percent.</p>
      <p>The move cheered China’s bond market and comes just two weeks after the PBoC cut the borrowing cost on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans by the same margin.</p>
      <p>Analysts say the unexpected cut on Monday shows the central bank is keen to ease investor worries that higher inflation will prevent it from delivering fresh stimulus measures.</p>
      <p>Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank in Singapore, said the reverse repo rate cut indicates a policy change in coming months, including “some fine-tuning to prioritize the pro-growth policy for the time being”.</p>
      <p>Driven by soaring pork prices from the spread of African Swine Fever, China’s consumer inflation rose past the government’s target of around 3 percent in October to its fastest pace in almost eight years, posing a dilemma for the PBoC.</p>
      <p>“I expected an easing move from the PBoC, just didn’t know when,” said a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager. “The [high] Consumer Price Index (CPI) was only pig CPI. Everything else is in big trouble.”</p>
      <p>He noted that the central bank continues to take a cautious approach to easing. In a report released on Saturday, the PBoC said it would maintain prudent monetary policy to prevent inflation from spreading.</p>
      <p>Market participants widely believe the two rate cuts in the open market operations suggest a similar adjustment in its newly established Loan Prime Rate.</p>
      <p>The PBoC will announce its monthly LPR fixing on Wednesday. The rate on the one-year fixing now stands at 4.2 percent while the five-year is at 4.85 percent.</p>
      <p>The rate cut bolstered the bond market on Monday morning, with China’s benchmark 10-year treasury futures for December delivery were up more than 0.4 percent.</p>
      <p>The PBoC has skipped reverse repo operations for 15 straight trading days before the resumption on Monday, when it injected 180 billion yuan (US$25.74 billion) into the interbank market.</p>
