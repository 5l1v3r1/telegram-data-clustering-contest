      <h1>Bama QB Tua Tagovailoa Looks To Be In Good Spirits As He Dances In Hospital Bed (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is set to have hip surgery Monday after being evaluated in Houston.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending hip dislocation in Alabama’s 38–7 win over Mississippi State on Saturday after two defenders fell on top of him. Tua landed face down on the turf as his helmet came off as he rolled over in obvious pain. That was supposed to be his final play of the half, if not the game.</p>
      <p>Just one day later and Tua looks to be in good spirits as somebody recorded the Heisman Trophy candidate dancing to Kirk Franklin’s 2005 hit ‘Looking for You.’</p>
