      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/former-man-utd-transfer-target-20904673?fbclid=IwAR2vx8X9iBxlgkbNzdVNQj2zdhbUTTziO99shHhXE1E4HT-3tPjzFjV_y2I">Corriere dello Sport</a>, via Mirror, Real Madrid and Barcelona have joined Manchester United in the race for Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar. The Red Devils were reportedly keeping tabs on the Slovakian centre-back this summer and even had a bid rejected in the region of £50 Million before they decided to sign Harry Maguire.</p>
      <p>Now, both Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona are also after his services, as they look to replace key parts of their backline. While Los Blancos are looking for a long-term replacement for captain Sergio Ramos, the Blaugrana are hoping to replace Samuel Umtiti.</p>
      <p>However, signing Skriniar won’t be easy for any interested club. The Inter Milan star recently signed a new long-term contract and is a key part of Antonio Conte’s side. He has started every game for the Nerazzurri so far in the domestic league and the UEFA Champions League.</p>
