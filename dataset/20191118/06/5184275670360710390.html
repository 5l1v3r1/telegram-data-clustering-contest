      <p>It was 2017 when news came out that superstar Shah Rukh Khan had provided Rs 5 lakh to boxing legend Kaur Singh who was struggling to pay his medical expenses, and now this noble gesture of King Khan has inspired actor Karam Batth to make a film on Kaur Singh.</p>
      <p>“When I first got to know about Kaur Singh and his achievements (in December 2017), he was undergoing post-operation treatment in Mohali. His poor financial condition and inability to meet the medical expenses came as a shock for me. The pitiable condition of the Arjuna awardee also moved the Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan so much so that he gave him an amount of Rs 5 lakh through his team Kolkata Knight Riders.</p>

      <p>“After listening to the news, I was sure about my decision of choosing this story for my film. I was confident that people deserve to know about the struggles and life of this legend,” Karam said.</p>
      <p>The film, which also features Prabh Grewal, Baninder Bunny and Sukhbir Gill, has been shot in various parts of Punjab, and expected to release in 2020.</p>
