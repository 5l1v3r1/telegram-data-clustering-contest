      <h1>Anylayer HDI demand for 7nm APs surges from Chinese handset vendors</h1>

      <p>Demand for anylayer HDI boards from Chinese handset vendors has been increasing sharply as such boards are badly needed for carrying 7nm APs, now mainstream core SoCs for their smartphones, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>At the moment, HiSilicon's Kirin 980 and 990 SoC for Huawei smartphones and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ chip solution adopted by most other Chinese vendors have all adopted 7nm process node, requiring the support of anylayer HDI boards as general-spec HDI can hardly meet technological requirements for the advanced chipsets, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Huawei, originally expected to adopt SLP (substrate-like PCB) mainboards for its 2019 flagship models, has adopted anylayer HDI boards due mainly to cost concerns, inspiring Oppo and Vivo to follow suit for their top-tier smartphone models.</p>
      <p>The sources continued that relatively high cost has not only eroded the willingness of Chinese vendors to apply SLP to their handset mainboards, but also dragged down SLP's overall penetration.</p>
      <p>Demand for anylayer HDI will trend up steadily, with 4G handsets now using 10-layer anylayer HDI and 5G models even featuring 14-layer HDI. Anylayer HDI mainboard specs will certainly be upgraded further along with handset APs advancing to 5nm and 3nm process nodes, the sources said.</p>
