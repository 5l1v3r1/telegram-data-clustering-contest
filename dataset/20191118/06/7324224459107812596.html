      <p>The festive fundraiser, taking place in the castle grounds on December 8 will see hundreds of supporters stepping out in fancy dress to help St Giles Hospice.</p>
      <p>Hospice events manager Chloe Herbert said: “The Rudolph Run is a real highlight of our calendar at St Giles – it’s a fun, colourful event which really makes people feel that Christmas is on its way.</p>
      <p>"We love to see whole families and teams of friends or co-workers turning up dressed as elves, Santas and snowmen, which really adds to the fun. It’s a lovely atmosphere and everyone who takes part will receive a finisher’s medal and festive treats.”</p>
      <h3>Care</h3>
      <p>One St Giles supporter who is urging people to sign up is Mandy Bates, from Stonnall, who took part in last year’s Rudolph Run with her daughters just weeks after her mother-in-law died at the hospice.</p>
      <p>She said: “The Rudolph Run was a great day and we all really enjoyed it. I’d definitely recommend it to other people.”</p>
      <p>Mandy’s mother-in-law, Kathleen Bates, aged 77, from Streetly, received end-of-life care at St Giles Hospice in Whittington after she was transferred there from the hospital where she was being treated for cancer.</p>
      <p>“We were so glad she was able to be at St Giles for the last two weeks of her life. We did the Rudolph Run because we wanted to give something back for the amazing care she received,” Mandy added.</p>
      <p>The Rudolph Run is open to people of all ages and is suitable for all the family. The event is pushchair and wheelchair friendly and all dogs are welcome on a lead. Ticket prices are £15 for adults, £10 for children aged 5-15 years and £2 for under-fives.</p>
      <p>The event begins at 10am, to register visit <a href="https://www.stgileshospice.com/">stgileshospice.com</a></p>
