        <b>Kwabena Frimpong, founder of NPP Youth for Ntim, has advised youth of the New Patriotic Party ( NPP) to work assiduously to retain the party in power since it is they the youth who suffer if the party is out of power.</b>

      <p>“When the party goes into opposition, it is the youth that suffers most, so it is incumbent on all NPP youth to work tirelessly, harder, for the party to win 2020 and 2024. The longer the party stays in power the better for NPP’s youth,” the firebrand told  members Tertiary Students Confederacy (TESCON) of the New Patriotic Party at the University of Energy in the Bono Region.</p>
      <p>Mr Frimpong argued that the NPP has demonstrated that it has the youth at heart by formulating and implementing youth centred policies and programmes that have greatly transformed the lives of the youth of the country.</p>
      <p>“Successive NPP government have shown”, he opined, “that, they really mean well for the youth of this country with the introduction  of policies   like NABCO, Payment of Teachers and Nurses allowances, Youth in Afforestation, Youth employment et al. It would be in the interest of the youth to retain NPP in power as we’ve demonstrated that NPP is the party for the youth.”</p>
      <p>Several other speakers at the Freshers’ Orientation and General Meeting urged TESCON members to develop strategies to effectively mobilise members and ensure that the good works of the NPP are spread so that it can retain power come 2020 and beyond.</p>
      <p>Mr Frimpong is a tireless mobiliser of the NPP who has served, and continues to serve in various high ranking positions, notably as the current National Secretary of NPP Holy Gent and National President for Federation of NPP Youth.</p>
