        <b>Researchers from Holst Centre have used spatial atomic layer deposition (sALD) to create both the semiconductor and dielectric layer in a thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane. </b>

      <p>Using a low-temperature, large-area process for the backplane, the team created a 200 ppi QVGA display demonstrator. </p>
      <p>The process allows TFTs to be produced on cheaper, transparent plastic foils, significantly reducing the cost of flexible electronics applications such as displays and image sensors. </p>
      <p>Holst Centre has produced a display demonstrator using a backplane of top-gated self-aligned TFTs on a PEN foil.</p>
      <p>The backplane was produced at temperatures below 200 °C, achieving mobilities of 8 cm2/Vs in transistors with channel lengths down to 1 μm. It was then combined with an OLED frontplane to create a 200 ppi QVGA display.</p>
      <p>The demonstrator was produced using sALD equipment initially developed by Holst Centre and which is currently being commercialised by the start-up <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/3hOiCL7XZUR6nlyf2MyLa?domain=link.pressmailings.com">SALDtech</a>. </p>
      <p>Spun out from Holst Centre in 2018, SALDtech offers the only sALD tools for Gen 1 (32 x 25 cm) substrate size flat-panel displays currently available. </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, it received a second round of investment to develop and build production equipment that could be integrated into the production lines of next-generation flexible OLED displays for mobile phones, tablets, TVs and more.</p>
      <p>Many flat-panel displays today use the semiconductor indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) in the TFT backplane. IGZO is usually deposited via sputtering and requires a high-temperature anneal procedure to ensure performance. This high-temperature step necessitates substrates with high melting points, which are typically more expensive.</p>
      <p>Large-area sALD is an atmospheric-pressure technique that allows ultra-thin layers of materials to be deposited quickly with high compositional control and excellent thickness uniformity. </p>
      <p>The technique has previously been used to produce high-quality individual layers of materials for solid-state batteries and TFT backplanes. </p>
      <p>Now, for the first time, Holst Centre has used sALD to deposit both the IGZO semiconductor layer and the aluminum dielectric-oxide dielectric layer in an integrated TFT process onto a low-cost, transparent plastic foil.</p>
      <p>Using a single technique to produce multiple layers of material offers flexible TFT manufacturers the possibility of improving both production throughput and the interface between layers, which in turn increases device performance.</p>
