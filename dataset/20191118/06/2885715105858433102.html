      <p>FROM EXPENSIVE gifts for guests and councillors to lavish and decorative tentage, cash-starved <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Municipal Corporation will be splurging a whopping Rs 86.65 lakh on the Rose Festival that will be held at the Rose Garden. It will be a three-day event that will be held in the coming month of February.</p>
      <p>As per the documents of the estimates prepared by different wings of the corporation, tent at the Rose Garden will cost Rs 25 lakh while a few minutes of recital of piano for the chief guest will cost Rs 1 lakh.<br/>For branding of the Rose Festival alone, which is publicity only, Rs 2.90 lakh will be spent and another head of “publicity” has been shown in the documents which, officials say, will cost them Rs 2 lakh further.</p>
      <p>In this digital age, only to print invitation cards, pamphlets and brochures for the competitions that are going to be held at the event, the corporation will be spending Rs 4 lakh on the same.</p>
      <p>Decorating entry and exit gates of the garden and bouquets for guests will cost Rs 4.90 lakh while lighting and sound arrangement done will cost Rs 7.30 lakh to the exchequer. Block decoration near the main stage will cost Rs 30,000 over and above this expenditure.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, just barricading the boundary wall for the event using ropes at certain areas will cost Rs 80,000, something that can be done in a few hundreds. Only transporting the artistes using two CTU buses from their place of stay to the venue, officials say it will cost Rs 50,000.</p>
      <p>Arranging CCTV cameras for the festival which is a yearly event, prospective expenditure of Rs 1.50 lakh has been shown.</p>
      <p>Mineral water, refreshments and high tea to the guests at the event will also cost Rs 3 lakh while refreshments and stay of folk dance participants will cost Rs 2 lakh.</p>
      <p>For holding “newly wed competition”, civic officials have shown that an expenditure of Rs 3 lakh will be incurred for it. Similarly, for “antakshri competition”, documents say that there is a requirement of Rs 1.75 lakh for it and for rose quiz competition, Rs 80,000 is required. For rose prince and rose princess competition, they require funds of Rs 2 lakh while for rose king and rose queen competition, Rs 60,000 is required. For another “Mr and Miss Rose” competition, Rs 30,000 is required.</p>
      <p>Even as the tourism department of Chandigarh Administration spends lakhs on cultural evenings held at Leisure Valley on the occasion of the same Rose Festival, corporation officials have also shown in the documents that Rs 5 lakh will be spent in conducting their cultural evenings.</p>
      <p>Even as there is no requirement of a media centre, documents state that creating a media centre will cost them Rs 1 lakh. A photography competition will also cost Rs 2 lakh to them and arranging kites for kite competition, Rs 50,000 more will be spent.</p>
      <p>It has been discussed in the General House meetings many times that the entire event can be sponsored by companies and civic body can even make revenue from the festival but officials have been quite reluctant to work over the suggestion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Same competitions, arrangements but spending goes up</b>
      </p>
      <p>In just three years’ time, the expenditure incurred has almost doubled. In 2017, the corporation showed an expenditure of Rs 49 lakh which was Rs 55 lakh in 2018. In 2019 this February, the expenditure was shown Rs 75.59 lakh and now the event will cost Rs 87 lakh.</p>
      <p>Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla said that the splurging of funds is being done. “From Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh when it was started, the cost has reached almost Rs 87 lakh now. There are same events and I don’t understand the need to spend so much,” he said.</p>
