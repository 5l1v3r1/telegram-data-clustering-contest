      <p>Two of the greatest Dancehall Artists in Ghana and across the globe, Shatta Wale and Stonebwoy have sparked the internet with an adorable video of them hugging each other.</p>
      <p>I bet a lot of y’all didn’t see this coming after the unfortunate incident at the 2019 VGMA Awards earlier this year.<br/>But as fate would have it,these two great artists have finally smoked the peace pipe and can now share the same stage without any problem.</p>

      <p>During the 2019 4syte TV music video awards which occurred on the 16th of November at the Accra International Conference center, Shatta Wale was seen jamming to Stonebwoy’s track while the latter was performing on stage.</p>
      <p>Shatta Wale who was obviously elated by the performance kept on screaming Stonebwoy’s name. Stonebwoy then turned to him and went down to hug him.</p>
      <p>The crowd went nuts with their beautiful union as they were happy to finally see them once again supporting each other on the same platform.</p>
      <p>Currently, the scuffle at the 2019 VGMA night is still pending in court as Stonebwoy and Shatta Wale were slapped with a law suit by the event organizers for causing mayhem.</p>
      <p>Watch the amazing moment between the two below;</p>
