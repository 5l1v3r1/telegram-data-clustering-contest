        <b>All who have defaulted loans from 1975 to be on list of shame</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) has announced a new measure against all Kenyan beneficiaries who have defaulted on repayment from 1975.</p>
      <p>In an undated notice seen by Pulselive.co.ke, HELB noted that it will begin placing the names and photos of all loan defaulters on the local dailies in the next one month.</p>
      <p><i>"Please take not that the names and pictures of HELB loan beneficiaries who have defaulted repayment of the loan from 1975 to date shall be published in the leading newspapers after expiry of 30 days from the date of this notice and thereafter legal action may ensue against each defaulter as stipulated in the HELB act,"</i> the notice read in part.</p>

          <b>Ignoring messages from HELB</b>
        </p>
        <p>HELB explained that the notorious defaulters had failed to respond to various attempts by the loans board to reach them.</p>
        <p>
          <i>"Some beneficiaries who are in default have not responded to previous communication addressed to them yet the funds received from loan repayment are used to support the current needy students therefore sustained default hinders funding of other deserving Kenyan youth.</i>
        </p>
        <p><i>"HELB wishes to notify the general public and loan defaulters that the HELB student loan is a government debt which should be repaid as per the terms and conditions on which it was advanced,"</i> the notice elaborated.</p>
