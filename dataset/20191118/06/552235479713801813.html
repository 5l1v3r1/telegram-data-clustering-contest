      <h1>The Peter Lovenkrands Rangers lesson that is helping Nathan Young-Coombes fire Colts to victory</h1>
      <h2>The 16-year-old scored the second goal against Wrexham in Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final win.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McCarthy, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/david-mccarthy/</a></address>
      <p>Start spreading the news, NYC is something special.</p>
      <p>Nathan Young-Coombes, that is. A 16-year-old who wasn’t even born when his mentor was scoring the winning goal in the 2002 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/william-hill-scottish-cup">Scottish Cup</a> Final but has spent enough time with Peter Lovenkrands to appreciate the education he’s getting from the Dane.</p>
      <p>And all that studying paid off on Saturday when the teenage sub came off the bench to seal a victory for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> Colts team over Wrexham that has taken <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/graeme-murty">Graeme Murty’s</a> kids into the last four of the Tunnock’s Caramel Waffer Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Young-Coombes, the boy Rangers lured from Chelsea, was up against bigger, stronger defenders who play men’s football every week, but like his team-mates, he set about proving size isn’t everything.</p>
      <p>Murty’s boys passed the Welshmen to death and should have been much more than one goal up through the excellent Jamie Barjonas at the break before the National League team threatened to get back into the game in the second half.</p>

      <p>But Young-Coombes had other ideas and when Christian Dibble, son of former Ger Andy, spilled a Barjonas effort in the 70th minute, the kid snapped up the rebound to kill the contest and chalk up the highlight of his fledgling career.</p>
      <p>On the final whistle, he made a beeline for Gers coach Lovenkrands and admitted the former Ibrox striker is playing a key role in his development.</p>
      <p>He said: “Peter and I had been going over his goals for Rangers, Newcastle and Birmingham. We were homing in on how to get into the six-yard box, being alive and picking up scraps because that’s where you get a lot of joy.</p>
      <p>“I was lucky enough to pick up on what we were speaking about – getting in that box and get that goal.</p>
      <p>“I had noticed when I was on the bench that the keeper spilled one and I was hoping to get on and be alive to that. Peter was telling me, any shots at the goalie, make sure I was following in. And I was lucky enough to get my goal.</p>
      <p>“We are always talking about how I can take my game to the next level.</p>

      <p>“We were playing against a first team here and I’m only 16, so realistically I’m not going to bully them or outpace them.</p>
      <p>“Don’t get me wrong, I’m very confident in my own ability, but it’s about how I can beat a defender who is bigger than me, stronger than me. I can do it by being alive in the box and that’s what happened.</p>
      <p>“The managers are very good. They know where I am in my development. I am only 16, so getting Under-21 football against a first team like Wrexham, you’d think: ‘wow, hold on a second’.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of faith in what our coaches will do for me in the future.”</p>
      <p>Reaching the last four of this competition with a Colts team is no mean feat and although they relied on the experience of the two over-age players, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/george-edmundson">George Edmundson</a> and Jon Flanagan, it was kids like Lewis Mayo, anchoring the midfield, and Barjonas and Ciaran Dickson ahead of him who caught the eye.</p>
      <p>They were miles ahead of Wrexham in terms of technique, if not physique, and the 5,400 crowd lapped it up.</p>
      <p>Young-Coombes added: “Allowing us to play at Ibrox was great, we always want to play at Ibrox. The atmosphere was everything I hoped it would be.</p>

      <p>“I have been watching games from the stands, hoping to be on the pitch and it was a tremendous honour. That’s why we play football, to play on the big occasions with big crowds and big atmosphere. That’s every little boy’s dream, to play in games like that.”</p>
      <p>And the dream isn’t over. Not when they are still chasing the trophy won by the ‘big’ Rangers team in 2016.</p>
      <p>Raith Rovers, Inverness and Partick Thistle are blocking their path but wins over Berwick, Stranraer, Ballymena, Solihull and now Wrexham show that this team isn’t easily brushed aside.</p>
      <p>Especially when the Young Team has Young-Coombes.</p>
