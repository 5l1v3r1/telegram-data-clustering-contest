      <h2>Our top team look over the big issues in Scottish football as Steve Clarke aims to make it three wins from the last three for Scotland.</h2>

        <b>Scotland will discover their Euro 2020 play-off semi-final rivals on Friday with Bulgaria or Israel the likely opponents. Would you fancy Steve Clarke’s men at Hampden?</b>

      <p><b>Keith Jackson:</b> Yes. That may sound like a leap of faith - and it probably is - but there are signs that Clarke is getting something going with this team. It might not be enough to stop the world in its tracks but it should be enough to deal with any of those three.</p>
      <p><b>Michael Gannon:</b> It’s hard to have any kind of confidence with a severe lack of evidence to back it up. Bulgaria and Israel are nothing to be scared of. We are in with a shout though and if <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Clarke</a> can get key men back fit then it’s game on.</p>
      <p><b>Fraser Wilson:</b> If the Tartan Army can be mobilised and fill out the National Stadium then you’ve got to think Scotland - starting to finally find some momentum - would be too strong for all three on home turf. But Israel gave us a fright in the Nations League so, as always, it will be a nerve-shredder.</p>
      <p><b>Gavin Berry:</b> Bulgaria are woeful and we won against Israel at Hampden last year so there’s nothing to fear there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Should the SPFL agree to postpone the full Scottish Premiership card scheduled to take place just five days before that massive play-off in March?</b>

      <p><b><b>Keith Jackson:</b> </b>I’m pretty relaxed on this one. Five days should give Scotland all the time they need but if Steve Clarke wants more preparation time - and if the SPFL can find a way to give him it - then it makes sense to come to an arrangement. Chances like this don’t come around here very often.</p>
      <p><b>Michael Gannon:</b> They should but they probably won’t. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> could do with the help but it might even be pointless as the boys playing in England would be on duty anyway.</p>
      <p>The top performers are used to going out a couple of times a week so Clarke might just have to hope they can come through unscathed.</p>
      <p><b>Fraser Wilson:</b> Absolutely. It’s time for everyone from the league to our clubs and to the supporters to get behind the national team and give them the best chance to end the 22-year wait for a spot at a major finals. That wouldn’t cover our stars down south of course but we have to live in hope that Andy Robertson and co will be raring to go for the play-off.</p>
      <p><b>Gavin Berry:</b> Other factors would come into it such as the broadcasters and when the games would be played but if it’s possible then it’s a no-brainer. Steve Clarke would benefit hugely from that extra preparation time with the players at Oriam.</p>
      <p>
        <b>With 10 games to go, will Alfredo Morelos bag the 11 goals needed to reach Marco Negri’s 33-goal tally before the new year for Rangers in 1997?</b>

      <p><b><b>Keith Jackson:</b> </b>Matching Negri’s half season haul will be a bit of a push but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> will get close. More importantly, he’ll go the distance in the second half of the campaign where the Italian’s hot streak went cold.</p>
      <p><b>Michael Gannon:</b> If Morelos can stay fit then he’ll give Negri a run for his money. The games are coming thick and fast but Steven Gerrard might chose to rotate his front men to keep them both fresh.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Fraser Wilson:</b> In his current form I’d expect so. The Colombian is playing the best football of his life and scoring all sorts of goals. Breaking his international duck can only boost his confidence further.</p>
      <p><b>Gavin Berry:</b> It’s achievable but with Steven Gerrard likely to leave him on the bench for some games to give Jermain Defoe time on the pitch then it he might just not get enough minutes to manage it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>With Hatem Abd Elhamed ruled out of the Betfred Cup final how should Neil Lennon solve the right back dilemma he now faces for the Hampden showpiece?</b>

      <p><b><b>Keith Jackson:</b> </b>There is no dilemma. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremie-frimpong">Jeremie Frimpong</a> was already rivalling the Israeli for a starting place. His high energy, all action approach is made for a pitch of this size.</p>
      <p><b>Michael Gannon:</b> Moritiz Bauer managed to handle the heat at Ibrox so Lennon would have no fears chucking him in. But he should be bold and stick with Jeremie Fringpong. The youngster has been superb and he could have a lot of joy in the wide open spaces at Hampden.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Fraser Wilson:</b> That’s a tough one. Jeremie Frimpong seems to be the preferred choice for back-up in the league but I have a sneaky suspicion Lennon will go for experience at Hampden and play Moritz Bauer. Frimpong hasn’t been overly-tested defensively and Bauer could be the safer option.</p>
      <p><b>Gavin Berry:</b> Jeremie Frimpong looks like you could chuck him into the World Cup final and he wouldn’t be fazed but it would be his stiffest test defensively in a Celtic shirt up against Ryan Kent and Lennon’s best option might be to stick Kris Ajer at right back with Nir Bitton and Christopher Jullien his central pairing.</p>
