      <h1>Ryan Jack admits Rangers Europa League run has prepared him for Scotland bow as he stakes claim for regular place</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder thinks two seasons of experience in the Europa League have sharpened his game for international football.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Jack has been one of the first names on the teamsheet for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> this season and he’s hoping he’ll now be the same for Steve Clarke after finally getting his chance to shine for Scotland.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox midfielder has been receiving rave reviews for Gers at home and in Europe this season but he’s had to be patient to get his crack in the national team engine room.</p>
      <p>The call came in Cyprus at the weekend and the 27-year-old looked every inch the international player in the heart of the team alongside Old Firm rival <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/callum-mcgregor">Callum McGregor</a> .</p>
      <p>Jack stepped in to replace Scott McTominay but he insisted he has no intention of slipping back in to a support role.</p>
      <p>He said: “That’s what I am hoping for, that it’s a successful season. Everything is going well so far.</p>
      <p>“Club level has been very good. I have been doing well in Europe and now I’ve got a start for my country after being called up.</p>
      <p>“Getting the win was great but in football you know that everything can turn very quickly. You can’t rest on it. It’s about more hard work and keeping things going.</p>
      <p>“Is it just the start? I hope so. I’ve always said I want to play for Scotland and be a part of it so I hope that is the case.</p>
      <p>“I hope I did enough here to get the nod again in the future.</p>
      <p>“Obviously I can’t decide that, but I enjoyed every minute of it against Cyprus.</p>

      <p>“The experience I’ve gained playing in Europe always helps, of course it does. I’m playing for a good team at club level and facing good opposition in the likes of Porto and Feyenoord.</p>
      <p>“That does help when I come away on these trips. I really enjoyed it and I’m just glad we got the win.”</p>
      <p>Jack relished the chance to play in his regular role and play a part in an important Scotland victory.</p>
      <p>It was scary at times but Clarke’s men got the win to stay on track to finish third in Group I and head in to the Nations League play-offs in the spring with confidence.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s obviously a proud moment every time you get called up or get a cap.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But I don’t want to stop. I want to keep going and I want more. Hopefully, this can be a box ticked and I get the nod in the future.</p>
      <p>“As a squad, we want to build momentum and get wins. It’s not all been positive in this campaign, but hopefully we can go three wins on the spin on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>“You want to put in the performances now to stake a claim for the huge games coming up in March. If we can get the wins and build momentum then hopefully we will go into the play-offs with a real chance.</p>
      <p>“It was good to be in there. I have come away with the squad, worked hard and the gaffer has been really good with me.</p>
      <p>“It’s all positive. And we are looking to now take that into Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>“I’ve played with Callum before for the Under-21s. It was good. I enjoyed playing with everyone, to be honest. I felt we dug in well when we had to and showed a bit of resilience.”</p>

      <p>Scotland had to do it the hard way in Nicosia after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-christie">Ryan Christie</a> ’s early opener was cancelled out.</p>
      <p>But Jack said: “The manager did say that if we face adversity we have to stand up to it.</p>
      <p>It was obviously a tough night and a tough test, but it was job done and we got the win we wanted.”</p>
      <p>Jack doesn’t see it as a straight fight with McTominay for the Scotland anchor man role but he’s now the man in possession of the jersey and is looking to kick on against Kazakhstan tomorrow night and end a difficult campaign on a high.</p>
      <p>He said: “If you look at the midfield there is talent right through it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Kenny McLean and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">Scott McTominay</a> are out with injuries. Then you have myself, Callum, John McGinn, John Fleck, Stuart Armstrong. The list is endless because there is that much talent in the one position.</p>
      <p>“Every time I get a chance, I just want to stake a claim. That’s all I can do. I’m sure the other boys are the same when they play. We are all working for the same goal and want to get to a major tournament.</p>
      <p>“Growing up, you always want to play for your country. You see the games at Hampden when there are full houses and the atmosphere that creates.</p>
      <p>“You want to be part it. But we can’t get carried away by anything now. We have won two on the bounce, but we want to go three and then try and get Scotland to a major tournament, which would be a great achievement.</p>
