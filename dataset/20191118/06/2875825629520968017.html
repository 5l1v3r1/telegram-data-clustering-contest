      <h2>The teenage sensation made his senior Ireland debut with a start in Thursday’s win over New Zealand</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Troy Parrott should be given time and space to become his own man, according to Glenn Whelan.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham teenage sensation made his senior Ireland debut with a start in Thursday’s 3-1 friendly win over New Zealand.</p>
      <p>And the 17-year-old will be on the bench for tonight’s all-important qualifier with Denmark where a moment of magic could send Ireland to the Euros.</p>
      <p>Whelan, 35, was stuck by Parrott’s confidence around the squad this week.</p>
      <p>But the Ireland veteran told reporters: “You guys and everyone need to let him get on with his football because he's only 17 and don’t put too much pressure on him.</p>
      <p>“Don’t be comparing him to Robbie [Keane] let him be Troy. Because there is a player there and let him go on and be Robbie.</p>
      <p>“But for now let him grow up.”</p>
