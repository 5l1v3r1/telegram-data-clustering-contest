      <p>Mexico City - <b>Brendon Todd</b>, coming off a victory two weeks ago in Bermuda, shared the lead with fellow American <b>Vaughn Taylor</b> on Sunday when darkness halted the final round of the PGA Mayakoba Classic.</p>
      <p>Taylor and Todd, both on 20-under par with four holes to finish, were among seven top-10 players yet to finish their final round when sunset fell at Playa del Carmen, Mexico.</p>
      <p>Mexico's Carlos Ortiz and American Harris English were on 19-under, Ortiz with one hole to play and English with four remaining. American Adam Long was on 18-under with three holes remaining.</p>
      <p>Competition will resume at 07:30 local time (14:30 SA time) with 12 players set to complete their 72 holes after heavy rains washed out play Thursday.</p>
      <p>To win, it might take matching or breaking the 72-hole tournament record of 22-under par set last year by Matt Kuchar.</p>
      <p>Todd seized the lead with a six-under par 65 in Sunday's third round and players went directly into the last round, rushing in a failed bid to complete 36 holes on the final day.</p>
      <p>Todd, 34, won his first US PGA crown at the 2014 Byron Nelson Championship then ended a five-year win drought during which he battled the full-swing yips by taking the Bermuda Championship two weeks ago. This is his first start since that triumph.</p>
      <p>"I feel great about my game. Happy to have a chance to win this after winning in Bermuda," Todd said. "I'm excited for the opportunity."</p>
      <p>Taylor, 43, seeks his fourth PGA title after taking the 2004 and 2005 Reno-Tahoe Opens and the 2016 Pebble Beach Pro-Am.</p>
      <p>"I'm just trying to hang in there best I can," Taylor said. "Didn't feel too great. I'm tied for the lead. I'm pleased."</p>
      <p>Taylor birdied the third hole in his final round, made back-to-back birdies at the ninth and 10th holes and sank another at the par-5 13th.</p>
      <p>Todd birdied the par-3 fourth, par-5 seventh and par-4 ninth and 12th holes to stay on top but could only par the 13th and took a bogey at 14 in the twilight before stopping on the 15th green alongside Taylor.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to hit it in there close and come back tomorrow and make a birdie," Todd said. "There was probably no benefit to me playing after making two fives in a row."</p>
      <p>While his playing partners raced to the 18th tee so they could finish, Ortiz decided against teeing off on the final hole due to the darkness.</p>
      <p>"The last shot, it was hard to see," Ortiz said. "The decision I took not to play, I think was the right one. I have a really good chance to win. Winning in front of my family and crowd would be a dream come true."</p>
      <p>Kuchar made a hole-in-one on the par-3 eighth hole in the final round while US compatriot Brian Gay aced the par-3 10th hole.</p>
