      <p>A sanitation worker in Pune is spreading awareness about cleanliness and waste management in a unique manner — by giving a spin to Bollywood classics. Needless to say, his message has hit home.</p>
      <p>Mahadev Jadhav, who has been working with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for 25 years now, says changes in the perception of people towards waste disposal is changing now.</p>
      <p>“No one asked me to sing, I sing so I can reach out to people…to create awareness among people as to where to put dry and wet waste, so the Corporation and the people can work together to solve the problem,” news agency ANI quoted him as saying.</p>
      <p>In his rendition of the classic ‘Kajra Mohabbat wala’, Jadhav explains the importance of segregating waste.</p>

      <p>“Kachra, sookha aur geela, sabne milla ke daala (Dry and wet waste, everyone mixed it together),” he laments in the song.</p>
      <p>He then warns against the use of plastic bags in the city. “Carry bag, ye plastic wala, isko aadat kar dala, aadat ne le li sabki jaan. (This carry bag made of plastic; this habit will kill us all).”</p>
      <p>Almost a year after the Maharashtra government implemented its ban on single-use plastic and thermocol items, it seems to not have had the desired effect on the ground, as revealed by the amount of plastic confiscated by municipal corporations early this year.</p>
      <p>While the state government introduced the ban in March last year, it began implementing the ban strictly only around June, once alternative products that could replace plastic were available in the market.</p>
