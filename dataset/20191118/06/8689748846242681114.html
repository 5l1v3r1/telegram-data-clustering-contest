      <p>Sarkodie was one of the biggest winners at the 2019 MTN 4Syte Music Video Awards after bagging 3 awards on the night which was held at the Kempinski Hotel in Accra.</p>
      <p>The Ghanaian rap King won the Best Male Video, Achievement Award, and Best Hip Hop Video.</p>
      <p>When he came up on stage to collect his Achievement Award, Sarkodie delivered a short speech which was very motivational and partially self-praising.</p>
      <p>Sarkodie asked all up and coming artists to keep pushing hard and not be distracted by anything whatsoever in their quest to reach the top.</p>
      <p>He then proceeded to thank his fans for the continuous support, saying they are the best in Africa.</p>
      <p>“Not to brag but I have the best fanbase inna whole of Africa.”</p>
