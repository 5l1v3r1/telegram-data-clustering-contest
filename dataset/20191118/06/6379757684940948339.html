      <p>NEMC director general Dr. Samuel Gwamaka revealed this at the weekend when he visited the project site during which he witnessed the main contractors – JV Arab Contractors and Elsewedy Electric supervision project work as well as ensuring conserving the environment.</p>
      <p>DR Gwamaka said: “This project, upon completion will generate 2115 MW of power, the country’s biggest hydro power project hence there is a need to make a close follow-up to ensure the work does not harm the environment.”</p>
      <p>He said NEMC has opened up a special zone near the project site for making follow-up on environment conservation due to the increase of human activities.</p>
      <p>He said the project will alleviate power shortage in the country and even export power to neighbouring countries, and called on all stakeholders to ensure the project is completed without any noticeable impact to the environment inside the Nyerere National Park.</p>
      <p>He said the completion of the project will spur the increase of tourists in the country due to the existence of the project including the infrastructure that will be built, all of which stand to drive the country’s economic growth.</p>
      <p>He said NEMC will continue to give education as well as the best way to conserve the environment to the workers in the project and local people in the environs.</p>
      <p>Visit of NEMC Managing Director to the project site is part of the Council’s efforts to oversee environmental conservation.</p>
