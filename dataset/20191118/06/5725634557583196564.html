      <h1>Greenwood Investors Third Quarter 2019 Letter: Long Pubs, Short Tourists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:52:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:52</time> by <a rel="author">GreenWood Investors</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>GreenWood Investors is a mostly-long, deep value investment firm focused on areas of extreme pessimism, structural inefficiencies and low competition.</li>
        <li>Exor exemplifies why "dead money" is a truism that is never true when skin in the game is involved, as Builders continuously compound value regardless if the market is paying attention or not. Ideally, like our coinvestment, the fundamental value compounds faster than the stock.</li>
        <li>Two business models encapsulated by the "pub approach," or the "tourist approach," underline why reputation and skin in the game correlate to the long-view. We are long pubs and short tourists.</li>
        <li>Boeing is a tourist that maximized short-term profits and management bonuses over safety. It continues to choose profits, meaning passengers and shareholders are in for a turbulent ride in 2020.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Exor (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXOSF">OTCPK:EXOSF</a>) exemplifies why “dead money,” is a truism that is never true when skin in the game is involved, as Builders continuously compound value regardless if the market is paying attention or not. Ideally, like our coinvestment, the fundamental value compounds faster than the stock;</li>
        <li>A personal experience in Jerusalem is a perfect anecdote about how stakeholder win-win outcomes are necessary for any progress to be made, particularly in a 500-year old business;</li>
        <li>Two business models encapsulated by the “pub approach,” or the “tourist approach,” underline why reputation and skin in the game correlate to the long-view. We are long pubs and short tourists;</li>
        <li>Boeing (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA">BA</a>) is a tourist that maximized short-term profits and management bonuses over safety. It continues to choose profits, meaning passengers and shareholders are in for a turbulent ride in 2020;</li>
        <li>The opposite approach in aerospace has been taken at an Italian aviation company we recently repurchased in a very timely fashion.</li>
