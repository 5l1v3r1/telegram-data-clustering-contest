      <h1>Report: Yomiuri Giants to post RHP Yamaguchi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:39:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:39</time> by <a rel="author">Manny Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>Nippon Professional Baseball's Yomiuri Giants will post 32-year-old right-hander Shun Yamaguchi, opening his path to the Major Leagues, according to a Sports Nippon report. Yamaguchi posted a 2.91 ERA over 170 innings for the Giants in NPB play this year, and he gave up three earned runs in a one-inning start during Japan's WBSC Premier12 tournament final in Tokyo over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Yamaguchi has spent 14 seasons in NPB, debuting with the Yokohama BayStars in 2006, and playing for them through the 2016 season before joining the Giants. He has a 3.35 ERA and 1.24 WHIP over 427 career appearances (90 starts) in NPB.</p>
      <p>During Yamaguchi's first season with Yomiuri in 2017, he was suspended for the second half after being charged with causing bodily harm to a hospital security guard and damage to hospital property while intoxicated -- he was reportedly at the hospital to get treatment on his pitching hand.</p>
      <p>Yamaguchi is one of a handful of NPB players who have either been posted or are expected to be this offseason. Others include Yoshitomo Tsutsugo, a power-hitting left fielder with Yokohama, and second baseman Ryosuke Kikuchi of the Hiroshima Carp. Outfielder Shogo Akiyama, most recently with the Seibu Lions, is an international free agent; he posted an .829 OPS in nine NPB seasons.</p>
