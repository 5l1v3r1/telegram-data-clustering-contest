      <h1>Govt considering using State-owned land for Direct Provision accommodation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:41:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>State-owned land could be used to provide Direct Provision accommodation.</p>
      <p>It is thought the move could be cheaper than paying private operators to house asylum seekers and is being considered by the Department of Justice.</p>
      <p>More than 3,700 people are applying for asylum in Ireland so far this year - the highest number in over a decade.</p>
      <p>This year's total is expected to be 40% more than last year.</p>
      <p>The Government has become more reliant on emergency accommodation options recently to deal with the demand, but in 2019, that cost the State â‚¬78m.</p>
      <p>The Immigration Minister of State for Immigration David Stanton believes using State-owned land could be 44% cheaper.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Irish Times, the Minister said using State land would require planning permission and would therefore be more transparent than the current system.</p>
      <p>He said that a complete move to State-owned accommodation may not be feasible, but he thinks increasing those types of centres could bring the cost down.</p>
