      <p>‘<i>Remember amnesia</i>’ is a niche movie, not niche because it can’t find a broader audience but because broader audiences will identify several niche factors. American movie, Check. American movie made in India, check. Intellectual thriller, check. Movie made by a practising doctor, check. The movie is both smart and silly, esoteric and egalitarian. Be it the title itself, director of the film or the whole cast. It’s a unique blend of western and eastern culture, especially south Asian.</p>
      <p>Though the director has been living in the United States for the past 20 years, his experience as a young Mumbaikar boy accompanying his cousin sister on films sets kept him fascinated throughout his journey. That cousin grew up to become a famous veteran actress of India, while the Mumbaikar boy got into a med school and became a practising Doctor.</p>

      <p>Dr Ravi Godse is among those few people who can manage time well, and that is the reason that despite such a rigorous post-graduation, he made time for his passion of film making. He has written and directed four films till now and currently working on the fifth one. The amount of time he dedicates to his film’s pre-production work is commendable. He goes through the rigorous process of visualising the shots with proper location and performances. Prep for 8 months and shoot for 8 days. Yes, the whole movie was wrapped in 8 days, lock, stock and barrel.</p>
      <p>That too shooting calmly and meticulously following all the rules. The movie features a decorated cast of actors like – Dileep Rao, Lisa Ann Walter, TovahFeldshuh, Curtiss Cook, Shruti Marathe, Mahesh Manjrekar, Vijay Patkar and Mohan Agashe. The cast was surprised to know how quickly and efficiently this movie was shot. Ravi seems to even capture the smell of the air in India versus Pittsburgh, through the brilliant cinematography of James Ledoux. And the wonderful music of Sanjay Wandrekar pulls us right into the movie from the beginning.</p>
