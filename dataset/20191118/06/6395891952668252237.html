      <p><b>CINCINNATIÂ (AP)</b> - An Ohio zoo says a 12-year-old male giraffe has died following a recent surgical procedure</p>
      <p>Officials with the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden say Kimba developed complications after undergoing a successful procedure last week to fix his hooves. The giraffe died early Sunday.</p>
      <p>The zoo's curator of mammals says zoo staff are devastated by the loss. Curator Christina Gorsuch says Kimba had been dealing with pain related to chronic lameness since last summer and officials had hoped the surgical procedure would help.</p>
      <p>She says they should know more about the cause of death after a necropsy.</p>
      <p>Kimba came to the zoo in 2008 from the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island. He had sired six giraffes.</p>
