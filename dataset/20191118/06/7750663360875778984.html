      <h1>'Unfair' to question Honda speed - Binotto</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mattia-binotto/"><b>Mattia Binotto</b></a> has refused to echo <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-vettel/"><b>Sebastian Vettel</b></a>'s words about the surprising performance of Honda's 2019 engine in Brazil.</h2>

      <p>After rivals earlier questioned the legality of Ferrari's power unit, Vettel said cheekily in Brazil that it is actually Honda's engine that is "suspicious".</p>
      <p>And although <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pierre-gasly/"><b>Pierre Gasly</b></a>'s second place finish in the race only followed the late-race crash chaos, the Frenchman and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/max-verstappen/"><b>Max Verstappen</b></a> - the race winner - scored Honda's first 1-2 finish for decades.</p>
      <p>But Ferrari boss Binotto was not pointing any fingers at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/"><b>Red Bull</b></a>'s Japanese supplier.</p>
      <p>"I am not able to explain what they are doing, I only know how we work," he told the Italian press at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>"Their speed was high, but to say surprising would be unfair," Binotto added.</p>
      <p>Binotto was furious that Vettel and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a> crashed into one another on Sunday, but he was also buoyed by the work Ferrari has done to close the gap in 2019.</p>
      <p>"Max was a couple of tenths faster, so there is work to be done," he said after the race.</p>
      <p>"But we have recovered a bit of the gap from the start of the season. We win when we have the fastest and most reliable car, but we are moving forward.</p>
      <p>"We have identified our weaknesses and this gives us hope for next year. If we look at this season overall, we lost because we still need a couple of tenths."</p>
