      <h1>Thailand: Inventory payback weighs on growth - ANZ</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:11:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) offer their quick reaction Thailand’s Q3 GDP report released earlier this Monday.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Thailand’s GDP expanded by 2.4% y/y in Q3, a marginal improvement from the 2.3% recorded in Q2, but still below market expectations.</p>
      <p>We are nudging down our growth forecasts to 2.6% and 3.0% (previously 2.9% and 3.3%) for 2019 and 2020 respectively following today’s weak outturn, which brought average growth in the first three quarters of 2019 to just 2.5% y/y.</p>
      <p>A drawdown in inventories was a key drag on Thailand’s growth in Q3. Final domestic demand improved slightly, while net exports were a positive contributor to growth.</p>
      <p>The bottom line is that Thailand’s growth has bottomed and a gradual recovery should follow. The BoT’s 25bp cut at its 6 November meeting likely marked the end of its easing cycle.”</p>
