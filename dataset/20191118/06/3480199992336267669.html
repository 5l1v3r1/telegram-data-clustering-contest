      <p>We want to hear your views on how the campaign has gone so far.</p>

      <p>So far we have seen scandals involving candidates, questionable policies, MPs quitting and gaffes from senior politicians... and the manifestos are not even out yet.</p>

      <p>It promises to be an election like no other â€“ and we want to hear your views on the state of play as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn set out on the route they hope will lead to Number 10.</p>
      <p>Today we launch our first major survey of the short campaign, asking readers a series of questions in a bid to gauge the region's mood.</p>
      <p>It may be a Brexit-inspired election, but what other issues are likely to be discussed on the doorstep?</p>
      <p>We want to know if readers are planning to change party from the last election, and whether people are optimistic when looking to the future.</p>
