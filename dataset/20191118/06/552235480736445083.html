      <h1>Forget Prince Andrew – Neil Warnock at Tynecastle is the interview we really need</h1>
      <h2>Warnock and Sven are the only men who can replace Levein says OldFirmFacts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Old Firm Facts</a></address>
      <p>Scotland arrived in Cyprus with nothing but pride to play for, having endured a series of disappointing results in their Euro 2020 qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Despite once again failing to impress, Steve Clarke’s side moved to third in the table thanks to goals from Ryan…nah, I can’t do it. I’m not going to waste your time or mine feigning interest in the international break.</p>
      <p>Not when I, along with the rest of the nation, have spent the last couple of days gripped by speculation about a controversial interview. I am of course referring to Neil Warnock’s potential job interview at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>“It’ll be an absolute belter if it happens” said Emily Maitlis, and I’m inclined to agree. But wait, there’s more. If Warnock were to be appointed manager of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a>, rumours suggest the Sporting Director working alongside him would be none other than Sven-Göran Eriksson. You know the one, looks like a substitute geography teacher but has a reputation as a bit of a sh***er.</p>
      <p>Warnock/Eriksson ’19 is without a doubt the most exciting ticket since Obama/Biden ’08, but to paraphrase the Rolling Stones, ‘You can’t always get what you want, especially in the case of the Hearts job because at the time of writing it looks more likely that Stuart McCall will get it’. Prescient words from the bold Jagger.</p>
      <p>McCall, who served as Warnock’s assistant at Sheffield United, is no slouch in the patter department. Not only is the clip of a drunk McCall falling off the roof of a car while still holding his can this century’s best ‘I know you’re not really into football but you’ll still find this funny’ video, he was also the man in charge of Rangers during the iconic Premiership play-off final defeat to Motherwell. He would also be the only manager in the SPFL who could represent Germany at the G7 summit without raising any eyebrows.</p>
      <p>That’s small potatoes, however, compared to Warnock’s track record. We’re talking about a man who is the double of Livia Soprano but with an even gloomier outlook. A man who, when talking about EL Hadji Diouf in January 2011, said “I was going to call him a sewer rat, but that might be insulting to sewer rats. He’s the lowest of the low”. A man who signed El Hadji Diouf for Leeds in August 2012.</p>
      <p>A man who, according to Paul Peschisolido, convinced his Sheffield United players “to put £10 in the pot, winner takes all. We agreed for some fun, then he pulled out his own bowling shoes and custom ball, shot 250 and took all our money”. A man whose name, as is regularly pointed out by his detractors, is an anagram of Colin W***er.</p>
      <p>Warnock coupled with Scottish football would be the best combination since Boris Johnson and unemployment, or at least the most talked about one since Prince Andrew and the Woking branch of Pizza Express.</p>
      <p>And then there’s Sven. In the course of a 42-year career in management he’s taken charge of such major teams as Roma, Benfica and Manchester City, as well as more obscure names like Guangzhou R&amp;F, Degerfors IF and England.</p>
      <p>He’s also been stung by the ‘Fake Sheikh’ and indulged in affairs with Ulrika Jonsson and FA secretary Faria Alam, all while looking like a crude 3D animation of a Dr Seuss character.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On a more serious note, there are some fans who’ve wondered whether Warnock is the right man to deliver success on the pitch. That’s a pessimistic view. Just look at Hearts’ performances this season and you’ll realise they have every chance of lifting the 2020/21 Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> casts a significant shadow, having spent the last few years ignoring any suggestion that Hearts should be winning trophies and instead, justifiably, focusing on delivering endlessly quotable lines at press conferences. In order to ensure there is no drop off in material, Neil Warnock is the only man who can replace Hearts manager Craig Levein. And Sven-Göran Eriksson is the only man who can replace Hearts Director of Football Craig Levein.</p>
      <p>Just don’t go down the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> route and appoint a sensible candidate who’ll probably prioritise points over patter. No-one wants that.</p>
