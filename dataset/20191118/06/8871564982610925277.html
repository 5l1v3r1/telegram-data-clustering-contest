      <h1>Danish starchitect to wrap Central Embassy in ‘world’s longest’ Xmas ribbon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:43:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>The holiday mall wars have begun and one downtown luxury mall’s looking to outdo the usual crowd-drawing displays by gift-wrapping the whole place in a record-setting stretch of ribbon.</p>
      <p>Starting Friday, Central Embassy will begin celebrating the year-end holidays with a Christmas-themed installation and ribbon advertised to be “the world’s longest,” as designed by the big-name Copenhagen firm Bjarke Ingels Group, aka BIG. </p>
      <p>Dubbed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2478176602237530/">The BIG Holiday</a>, the three-month event promises a variety of architectural art works on seven floors of the Phloen Chit mall as well as a 5-kilometer Christmas ribbon among lighting decorations to celebrate 2020. </p>
      <p>On Nov. 23, the company’s partner-project leader Brian Yang will share his inspirations and design concepts at a panel discussion. Admission is free; however, attendees are required to reserve seats <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWn-qNhjRXS-QYzh4kFL0t6iLWMINin6fIa1G7_0im_YqfCA/viewform">online</a>. </p>
      <p>Known for replacing traditional architectural conventions with playful and innovative approaches, BIG’s works include the Lego House, which is made from 25 million colorful building blocks, and a glowing, 10-foot heart installation in New York’s Times Square in 2012. The Danish architect is also behind The Twist Museum in Norway and Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art in South Korea, as well as Google’s London headquarters.</p>
      <p>The BIG Holiday will run Nov. 22 through Jan. 5 at Central Embassy. The luxury shopping mall can be reached via a skywalk from BTS Phloen Chit. </p>
