        <figcaption>Kamal Haasan’s contribution to Kollywood and Indian cinema as a whole is unparalleled. The actor, who celebrated his 65th birthday this month, is also celebrating “60 glorious years in Tamil cinema”. Kamal made his silver screen debut when he was only 5 in Kalathur Kannamma. He then went on to act over 130 films over the years. Even though the actor has had his fair share of misses at the box office, what people remember till today are his ground-breaking performances in films like Moondram Pirai, Indian, Pushpaka Vimana, Apoorva Sagodharargal, Nayakan, Hey Ram, Thevar Magan and Anbe Sivam among more. <br/><br/>The film fraternity came together at Ungal Naan to honour Kamal Haasan as he completed 60 years in the Tamil film industry. The event, held at the Nehru Stadium in Chennai, saw Rajinikanth, AR Rahman, Ilaiyaraaja and Mani Ratnam among others in attendance. Like Kamal’s films, this event also had every element needed to make audiences happy. The actor sang, became emotional and even showcased his close camaraderie with superstar Rajinikanth, much to every fan’s delight. <br/><br/>Take a look at some photos from Ungal Naan.</figcaption>
