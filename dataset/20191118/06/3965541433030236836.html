      <p>Replacing the water filter in your refrigerator is something you should do at least every six months or so. (You may need to do it more often based on usage and the water quality where you live.)</p>
      <p>Those replacement filters can be might pricey, up to $50.</p>
      <p>“We figured that over the 12-year life span of the average refrigerator, that could actually add 85 percent to the purchase price, so that is something you definitely want to keep in mind when shopping for a new refrigerator,” said Kevin Doyle, Executive Editor at Consumer Reports.</p>
      <p>LG, GE and Whirlpool refrigerators work just fine without a filter, so if you want to save money, you can go without.</p>
      <p>Doyle says Frigidaire and Electrolux will not dispense water or make ice unless a filter is installed.</p>
      <p>To make sure you're getting a quality filter, Consumer Reports suggests that you buy from the manufacturer or one of its retail partners.</p>
      <p>"We found that in terms of aftermarket brands, really none of them met recognized quality and safety standards, except for Culligan, which retails at about 40% less than those made by the manufacturers,” Doyle said.</p>
