      <h3>Arsenal are keen on a deal to sign Villarreal defender Pau Torres in the January transfer window, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p>The <i>Sun</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/arsenal-transfer-pau-torres-defensive-woes-nicolas-pepe-11169459/">Metro</a>, is reporting that the north London side have identified the 22-year-old defender as a potential target ahead of the mid-season transfer window.</p>
      <p>The same story says that Arsenal are “exploring” the possibility of a deal to sign Torres in January as they look to strengthen their options at the back.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have struggled to find consistent form this season and they have only won four of their opening 12 Premier League games to leave them off the pace in the race for a top-four finish.</p>
      <p>The same story reports that potential Gunners target Torres has a £43m release clause in his contract at Villarreal, and his current deal is not set to expire until 2024.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are likely to be linked with a number of potential signings in January as the north London side look to improve their form in the second half of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Torres has been a regular fixture in the Villarreal first team this season and has scored one goal and made one assist in 13 La Liga games so far this term.</p>
