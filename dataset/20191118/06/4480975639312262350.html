      <p>In opinion of Karen Jones, Team Head FICC Technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis">Analysis</a> Research at Commerzbank, EUR/USD could attempt to regain the 1.1080/95 area in the very near term.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a></b> has managed to stabilise around the 61.8% retracement at 1.0994. Thursdays price action constituted a key day reversal and we would allow for a rebound into the 1.1080/1.1095 band very near term. This is the location of the 55 day ma and we will need to regain this for a viable retest of the 1.1180 recent high. While capped by the 55 day ma, the market is regarded as under pressure and capable of extending the decline to the next <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> support at 1.0943”.</p>
      <p>“It is possible that we will see one more final leg down to the base of the channel at 1.0865 and the 1.0814 Fibo retracement before a sustained recovery is seen”.</p>
