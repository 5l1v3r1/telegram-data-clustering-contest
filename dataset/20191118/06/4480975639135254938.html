      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:50:34+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Patrik Schowitz, a global multi-asset strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, upgraded the outlook on global equities, in his latest client note published on Monday.</p>
      <p>The shift in the view is mainly in response to hopes for a breakthrough in Sino-US trade talks, reduced risk of a US recession and a moderately positive earnings outlook.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“We have held a cautious view on the outlook for equity markets for much of this year... however, the environment has shifted in recent weeks.” </p>
      <p>“That change likely reflects several factors, which we think has some more room to run.”</p>
      <p>“Emerging market equities are now our most favored region alongside U.S. large cap equities, which we believe can do relatively well under a range of scenarios.”</p>
      <p>“Our least preferred markets are Australia and U.S. small cap equities.”</p>
