      <h1>Buy the Huawei Mate 30 and get the P30 for free on Celcom</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:45:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p><b>[ UPDATE 18/11/2019 15:00 ]</b> The Huawei Mate 30 + Huawei P30 bundle can be yours from RM1,599 on a Celcom Postpaid contract. Full details at the bottom of the post.</p>
      <p>=====</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/huawei-mate-30">Huawei Mate 30 series</a> is officially available in Malaysia and Celcom is currently running a promo where you can get two devices for the price of one. The blue telco is offering a <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/huawei-p30/">Huawei P30</a> for free when you buy the Mate 30 on contract.</p>
      <p>Celcom has been very secretive on the offer with no further details on their <a href="https://www.celcom.com.my/">website</a>. Even their customer care line couldn’t provide more info on the Huawei Mate 30 bundle offer. If you want to learn more, you’ll have to walk <a href="https://www.celcom.com.my/support/store-locator">to their stores</a>.</p>
      <p>We think the offer could be similar to its previous <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/05/28/huawei-p30-buy-1-free-1-celcom/">Buy 1 Free 1 promo</a> where you’ll need to get two postpaid lines. It is likely to be tied to their highest Platinum Plus postpaid plan that has 100GB of data at RM188/month plus an additional supplementary line that costs RM48/month.</p>
      <p>In addition, Celcom is also offering unspecified freebies worth RM605. As a comparison, Digi had offered RM656 worth of freebies for early bird <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/11/digi-offers-the-huawei-mate-30-series-from-rm168-month-all-in/">Mate 30 pre-order</a> customers. This consists of a Huawei SuperCharge Wireless Car Charger, PU Casing, extended warranty and screen crack warranty.</p>
      <p><b>[ UPDATE 18/11/2019 15:00 ]</b> Celcom has published <a href="http://celcom.com.my/support/faq/personal#personal-devices-get-2-for-the-price-of-1">more details</a> on the offer. The free Huawei P30 bundle is applicable on both Celcom Platinum (RM148/month) and Platinium Plus (RM188/month) with a 24-month contract. On Celcom Platinum, the Mate 30 is offered at RM1,699 while on Platnium Plus, it is going for RM1,599. A supplementary line is also required as well.</p>
