        <b>One of England’s smallest trusts is facing a £7m annual deficit — roughly 10 per cent of its turnover — for at least the next four years, and is struggling to access sustainability funding.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.qvh.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/QVH-BoD-Public-Nov-2019-FULL.pdf">This month’s board papers</a> for Queen Victoria Hospital Foundation Trust, a specialist trust based in East Grinstead in Sussex, revealed it expects its deficit to be £7.4m for 2019-20 and then to run at around £7m for the next five years, although it added it could breakeven in 2023-24 if it was given support. </p>
      <p>However, the trust does not have an agreed control total with NHS Improvement for this year and is therefore not eligible for provider sustainability funding.</p>
      <p>The trust’s chief executive is working with the Sussex sustainability and transformation partnership — Sussex Health and Care Partnership — “to encourage them to recognise the underlying position of the trust and provide realistic support to a sustainable breakeven position in 2023-24”.</p>
      <p>Last year, the trust missed its control total of £0.6m surplus and had a deficit of £5.2m — approximately 7.4 per cent of its turnover of around £70.2m. Financial sustainability is rated at a maximum 25 in its risk ratings.</p>
      <p>Although the trust did not agree a control total this year, <i>HSJ</i> understands this is because it was still working through its likely deficit at the time it was being set. This problem may be resolved for 2020-21, which would allow the trust to access financial recovery funding. However, the prospect of underlying deficits continuing for so long may raise some eyebrows at NHSI, <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/finance-and-efficiency/following-the-money-same-old-deficit-story/7026177.article">which is pushing trusts to accept more stretching trajectories</a>.</p>
      <p>The trust still has to identify some of the cost improvement programme savings it needs to make this year.</p>
      <p>The financial deficit is just one of the issues the QVH faces. It developed as a specialist burns and plastic surgery site after World War II pilots were treated there and now provides specialist services for a wide area, as well as having a minor injuries unit.</p>
      <p>But it does not have some 24/7 diagnostic services or other specialties colocated with its services and is increasingly working with the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust to ensure patients have access to round-the-clock care and expert opinion. In some cases, consultants’ job plans cover both trusts.</p>
      <p>This summer, <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/trust-to-close-specialist-childrens-service/7025458.article">it temporarily stopped taking paediatric burns inpatients</a> and, over the next few years, it expects its adult burns inpatients service to move to Brighton. Outpatient burns services are unaffected.</p>
      <p>In 2018, a review found <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/trust-waiting-list-soars-after-review/7023295.article">its reported waiting list</a> was a quarter higher than it had been reporting and it had 145 52-week waiters. In September 2019, it still had 25 patients waiting more than 52 weeks, most of whom were in its plastic surgery division, and its 18-week wait performance was below 82 per cent.</p>
      <p>The trust declined to comment.</p>
