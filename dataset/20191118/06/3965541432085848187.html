      <p>SEATTLE -- Seattle Children's Hospital says 10 of its operating rooms will now remain closed through January to deal with the Aspergillus mold outbreak.</p>
      <p>The hospital says they will immediately install what is called custom in-room HEPA filtration in those 10 operating rooms and two equipment storage rooms.</p>
      <p>The installation was scheduled to be complete by July, but the hospital says they will now be fully installed by the end of January.</p>
      <p>That means 10 operating rooms will be closed down until then, all to make sure Aspergillus mold stays out of critical areas in the hospital.</p>
      <p>"(The mold) lives inside and also outdoors," says Larissa Lewis, a nurse consultant with the Department of Health. "It can be found in dirt and dust and thing like that."</p>
      <p>It is still not clear what caused the mold to resurface this time and is part of an investigation underway by the hospital and their regulator, the State Department of Health.</p>
      <p>"Aspergillus causes infections in people who are very immune compromised," Lewis said.</p>
      <p>And this time, one child is now sick from the mold, and there's another possible case that has not yet been confirmed.</p>
      <p>The hospital has three operating rooms still functioning, but many surgical cases are being sent to other local hospitals such as UW Medical Center, Harborview and Mary Bridge Children's Hospital, officials said. Many other surgeries will be postponed.</p>
      <p>Seattle Children's says they are sorry for the impact this will have on their patients and their families but that this is the safest option for the children they treat.</p>
