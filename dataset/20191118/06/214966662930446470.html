      <h1>Police release CCTV footage to track down hit and run driver, Logan </h1>

      <p>Police are calling on anyone with information about a hit and run in the Logan area to come forward.</p>
      <p>Just before 7.00pm on Sunday night, a dark coloured car is understood to have collided with a motorcycle at the intersection of Chambers Flat Road and Hickory Street in Marsden.</p>
      <p>The vehicle then fled the scene, while the motorcyclist – 30-year-old Browns Plains man – sustained serious injuries and was rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>Early investigations suggest that two people were in the darkly coloured car, which police believe may have been a Mazda CX station-wagon.</p>
      <p>Police have released CCTV footage, which they hope will help lead them to the owners of the dark coloured vehicle.</p>
      <p>It shows the blue vehicle continue south along Chambers Flat Road before turning right onto Bumstead Road.</p>
      <p>Investigators are appealing to anyone who witnessed the crash, has any knowledge of the blue vehicle – possibly a Mazda CX station-wagon – or may have relevant dash-camera vision, to come forward.</p>
