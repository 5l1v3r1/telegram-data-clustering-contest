      <h1>Parents of dead Cornell student offering $10K for info on son’s death</h1>

      <p>The parents of a Cornell freshman who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/">found dead</a> in a campus gorge reportedly are offering $10,000 for information on their son’s death.</p>
      <p>The family of 18-year-old Antonio Tsialas are making the plea through two full-page ads in the Ivy League school’s student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun, which will run Monday and Tuesday, the family’s lawyer, David Bianchi, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/us/cornell-university-student-death-antonio-tsialas/index.html">told CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>Tsialas’ family is seeking answers on how their son died last month. The student, a Miami native, was last seen leaving a campus frat event about 9:30 p.m. Oct. 24.</p>
      <p>His body was found at the base of Fall Creek Gorge two days later.</p>
      <p>The night before he vanished, he dined with his mother, who was in town for Family Weekend.</p>
      <p>His mother said her son was happy at college and had been selected as a campus tour guide, in addition to joining the Cornell Mundial FC club soccer team, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/coconut-grove/article236702618.html">the Miami Herald reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances of Tsialas’s death are still under investigation, but no foul play is suspected,” police said in a statement at the time.</p>
