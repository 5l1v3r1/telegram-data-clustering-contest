      <h1>Whites can be black if they wish, says lecturers' union</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:34:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/mike-wright/" target="_blank">Mike Wright</a></address>
      <p>People should be allowed to identify as black no matter what colour they are born, a lecturers' union has said.</p>
      <p>The University and College Union (UCU), which represents more than 100,000 university lecturers and staff, set out its position on whether people should be able to self-identify as different races or genders.</p>
      <p>In the paper "UCU Position on Trans Inclusion", it stated: "The UCU has a long history of enabling members to self-identify, whether that is being black, disabled, LGBT or women."</p>
      <p>The union's stance was criticised by some of its own members as "nonsensical". Kathleen Stock, a professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex, wrote on Twitter: "I'm still [a] member of UCU but Christ they make it hard when [they] publish this nonsensical, anti-intellectual propaganda."</p>
      <p>The debate over racial self-identification has become heated in recent years. Last November, Anthony Lennon, a white theatre director who describes himself as an "African born again", drew criticism for securing public funding intended to help ethnic minorities develop their stage careers.</p>
      <p>Mr Lennon, 53, who was born in London and whose parents are Irish, won a place on a two-year Arts Council-funded scheme, after a leading black theatre company accepted his claim to be of "mixed heritage".</p>
      <p>Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said allowing people to self-identify their race meant members of ethnic minority communities "lost out".</p>
      <p>The UCU's paper also reaffirmed that it supported a "social, rather than medical, model of gender recognition".</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the UCU said: "Self-identification is a standard practice in many organisations and the Office for National Statistics says 'there is no consensus on what constitutes an ethnic group and membership is something that is selfdefined'."</p>
