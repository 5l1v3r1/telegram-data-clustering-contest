        <b>Ben Davies is happy to be among quite a rare breed of left-footed centre-halves and hopes the balance it gives the Preston defence can help keep them challenging at the top of the Championship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>His left-foot/right-foot partnership with Patrick Bauer has won plenty of plaudits this season.</p>
      <p>They have played 15 of the 16 league games together, an ankle injury keeping Davies out of the derby win against Blackburn in which Preston found themselves 2-0 down early on.</p>
      <p>Davies told the Lancashire Post: “I do think it helps when you have a left-footed option in the defence.</p>
      <p>“You’d be surprised how many times the manager says to show a centre-back down one side because they don’t use their left foot.</p>
      <p>“There don’t seem to be too many left-footed central defenders about.</p>
      <p>“Playing out from the back and doing it from both sides is quite an important part of how we play.</p>
      <p>“My left-foot has always been the stronger. I like to think I can clear the ball with my right and make a 15-20 yard pass.”</p>
      <p>Davies, 24, is enjoying his partnership with Bauer.</p>
      <p>He thinks they will get stronger with the more games they play.</p>
      <p>“Patrick has done very here, he is a good solid centre-back and is a leader.</p>
      <p>“Even though he hasn’t been here too long, you can see how he leads and he was a leader at his other clubs.</p>
      <p>“It does take time to build a pairing at centre-half, it takes time to build an understanding.</p>
      <p>“I still think there is more to come from Patrick and myself, there is still room for improvement.</p>
      <p>“The longer you play next to someone and learn their game, the more a partnership will improve.</p>
      <p>“Even though we have started well together, we can get better.”</p>
      <p>While the rest of the PNE squad were reporting back to Springfields today for training after a long weekend, Sean Maguire and Alan Browne have their sights set on trying to reach Euro 2020 with the Republic of Ireland tonight.</p>
      <p>The Irish face Denmark in Dublin and it is a must-win game for them.</p>
      <p>Both started Thursday’s 3-1 friendly win over New Zealand, with Maguire scoring a 20-yard shot – that his first international goal.</p>
      <p>There is a possibility that Maguire could start, with him an option to start on the right side of the attack.</p>
      <p>He played on the left in the New Zealand game but that role is likely to be filled by James McClean.</p>
      <p>But there is a vacancy on the other side, with former PNE striker Callum Robinson also under consideration.</p>
