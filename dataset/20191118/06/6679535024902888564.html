      <p>To reduce air pollution the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) plans to offer gas connections to roadside food vendors who use coal or wood fired ovens (open chullahs) for cooking.</p>
      <p>WBPCB secretary Rajesh Kumar said the pollution control body plans to offer environment-friendly LPG cylinders to food vendors with the support of oil PSUs like Indian Oil Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kumar said this during a recent meeting with Concern for Calcutta, a statement issued by the NGO said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The WBPCB Secretary said legal action would be taken against hawkers if they continue to use solid fuels.</p>
      <p>As per the Air Quality Action Plan, approved by Central Pollution Control Board and the National Green Tribunal, the components that contribute substantially to air pollution are coal or wood-fired ovens, which have high air pollution potential.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kumar also asked people to download and use the ‘Paribesh’ app through which citizens can instantly complain about garbage-related problems or problems of waste burning on roadsides, it said.</p>
      <p>He also underlined the plan to eliminate the menace of plastic by creating incentives like paying a small amount for collecting and depositing the waste plastic like milk pouches, the statement added.</p>
