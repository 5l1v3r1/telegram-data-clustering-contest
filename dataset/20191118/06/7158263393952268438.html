      <p>On Monday, the Minnesota Twins baseball team announced one of its rising talents, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/18/major-league-baseball-prospect-ryan-costello-found-dead-new-zealand/">Ryan Costello, passed away at 23 years old</a>. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28107216/twins-prospect-ryan-costello-found-dead-new-zealand-hotel-room">According to </a><i><a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28107216/twins-prospect-ryan-costello-found-dead-new-zealand-hotel-room">ESPN</a></i>, the Major League Baseball prospect was found dead in his hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand. It's presumed he passed away in his sleep.</p>
      <p>The Auckland Tuataras, an Australian Baseball League team, released a statement suggesting that Costello, who was supposed to play for them later this year, died of natural causes, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094452/mlb-third-baseman-ryan-costello-dead-at-age-23">according to <i>E!</i></a>. They said, "It is with great sadness that we report the passing of Auckland Tuatara third baseman Ryan Costello overnight in Auckland."</p>
      <p>This morning, the Twins posted a statement on Instagram and Twitter. It read:</p>
      <blockquote>"We are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Ryan Costello. The entire Twins organization sends our most sincere condolences to Ryan's family, friends, coaches, and teammates."</blockquote>
      <p>The team's <a href="http://www.startribune.com/twins-prospect-ryan-costello-found-dead-in-new-zealand-hotel-room/565080182/?refresh=true">assistant general manager, Jeremy Zoll, tweeted</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"Ryan's infectious energy and drive for greatness will never be forgotten. He is the definition of a great teammate and has been taken from us far too soon. Sending thoughts and prayers to the Costello family."</blockquote>

      <p><a href="https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Pro-baseball-player-from-CT-found-dead-in-New-14842895.php">And according to <i>CT Post</i></a>, Mike Harrison of Connecticut posted on Facebook on behalf of Costello's family. He wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>"On behalf of his family here at home thank you for everyone who got to meet him there he said it was beautiful and the people were so nice! We are deeply saddened and are in disbelief we loved him so much! He will be missed forever.”</blockquote>
      <p>Costello was fairly new to the professional baseball world and was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in 2017. A year later, the third baseman joined the Twins. And in 2019, he played in Florida.</p>
