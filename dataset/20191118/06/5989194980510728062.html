        <b>Swedish police and other judicial authorities will be able to use surveillance cameras without first receiving a permit, starting from January 1st next year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following a decision in <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/arende/betankande/kamerabevakning-i-brottsbekampningen----ett_H701JuU5">parliament</a>, several authorities will now be able to operate CCTV without first gaining permission fromÂ the Data Inspection Board, as is usually required.</p>
      <p>The change applies to Swedish police, the Swedish Security Service, the coast guard, and Swedish customs.</p>
      <p>The requirement is that the surveillance can only happen if the benefit of it is judged to be more significant than the individual's right not to be observed, but it will be up to the individual authorities to make that decision.</p>
      <p>The authorities will have to document their decision, and the Data Inspection Board will be responsible for supervision, and will have the power to fine authorities who don't carry out this documentation.</p>
      <p>All parties represented in parliament except the Left Party voted in favour of the change.</p>
