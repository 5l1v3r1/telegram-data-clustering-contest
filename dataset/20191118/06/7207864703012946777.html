      <p><b>Key point: </b>The birth of "double trouble."</p>
      <p>At some point during the tail end of World War II, a creative engineer at North American Aviation looked at the P-51 Mustang and wrote a memo to his boss stating that if one Mustang was amazing, <u><a href="https://www.boeing.com/history/products/p-82-twin-mustang.page">then two Mustangs merged together</a></u> by steel and rivets would be possibly the greatest thing to fly, ever. With one cockpit devoted to radar and the other to flying, the F-82 Twin Mustang — nicknamed “double trouble” — was born. What they didn't know was that the Twin Mustang was destined to cement it's place in history over the skies of Korea. </p>
      <p>The F-82 was an aircraft born in the wrong era. The German fielding of the Messerschmitt ME-262 at the Second World War’s close signaled the dawn of the jet-powered fighter. As the Korean War started, Air Force jets like the F-80 were replacing the F-51D Mustangs and F-82s that had become the core of the Air Force fleet. But there were still three squadrons of F-82s stationed in Japan. Their <u><a href="https://www.wainwright.army.mil/application/files/8215/0912/6016/F-82_Twin_Mustang.pdf">radar-housing double fuselage</a></u> gave the 5th Air Force an all-weather capability that would come in handy as the cold war turned hot.</p>
      <p>On June 27th, 1950, five F-82s were performing a high-stakes escort mission for Air Force transports evacuating civilians out of Seoul. The North Korean Army had <u><a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/how-the-korean-war-started-65-years-ago/">barrelled across the border</a></u> on the 25th and put the city in its crosshairs. Although the U.S.-aligned South Koreans had fighting spirit, they <u><a href="https://history.army.mil/books/korea/20-2-1/SN03.HTM">lacked tanks and air support</a></u>, which the North had in abundance. It was rapidly apparent to the United States that Seoul would fall, and fall fast. Evacuations began by sea and air, with <u><a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a440095.pdf">F-82s providing protection</a></u>.</p>
      <p>A flight of Soviet-built Yak-11s and La-7s appeared near Kimpo Airfield to intercept the evacuating transports. <u><a href="http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Portals/7/documents/education/teacher_resource_korean_war.pdf">Lt. William G Hudson and his radar operator Lt. Carl Fraser</a></u> jumped into the furball, shooting down a Yak-11 and cementing their F-82 as the first American aircraft to get an air-to-air victory in Korea.</p>
      <p>The F-82 continued to fight on in the conflict until 1952, when the final Twin Mustang was sent out for rear-guard duty in Alaska. The introduction of advanced jet fighters like the MiG-15 signaled the end of the prop fighter era, and the skies over Korea were soon filled with F-86 Sabers and MiG-15s engaged in a deadly ballet of atomic age acrobatics. But by then, the F-82 Twin Mustang had already cemented its place in Air Force history on that day over Seoul.</p>
