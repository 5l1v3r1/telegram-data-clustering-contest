      <p>MUSCAT: Winless in four games so far in an increasingly disappointing campaign, the Indian football team faces higher-ranked Oman in a do-or-die World Cup qualifying round match on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A first half strike from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sunil-chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a> gave India hopes of beating Oman in the first leg in Guwahati in September but it ultimately turned out to be so-near-yet-so-far as the Gulf nation struck twice in the final 10 minutes to outwit the home side.</p>
      <p>Oman are coming into this match after an emphatic (4-1) win over Bangladesh on November 14.</p>
      <p>India, on the other hand, are struggling after an impressive goal-less draw against Asian champions Qatar as they needed late equalisers in their identical 1-1 draws against lower-ranked Bangladesh and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>After three draws and a defeat, India are fourth in the Group E table with three points while Oman are second with nine points from four matches. Qatar are on top with 10 points from four matches.</p>
      <p>An upset win over Oman will certainly keep Igor Stimac's side in the hunt for a next round berth but a loss will virtually send India out of reckoning as far as the 2022 World Cup qualification is concerned.</p>
      <p>If India lose, they will trail Oman by nine points and have only three matches -- maximum nine points -- left to play in this second round of the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Even the runner-up sides from the eight groups are not guaranteed an automatic spot in the third round of the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>A draw against Oman will also make it difficult for India to qualify for the next round. Their last three matches -- all to be played next year -- are against Qatar (at home on March 26), Bangladesh (away, June 4) and Afghanistan (at home, June 9).</p>
      <p>But getting a least a point against Oman may prove crucial as it will make it easier for India to get an automatic third round berth for the 2023 Asian Cup qualifiers.</p>
      <p>This campaign is also a joint qualifying round for the 2023 Asian Cup and the third-placed teams and the best four fourth placed teams from the eight groups automatically get a spot in the third round of the qualifiers of the continental championships.</p>
      <p>Stimac's side has struggled not just in defence but four matches into this campaign, it is also clear that its offence is also not in the best of form.</p>
      <p>India is no longer dependent on only Chhetri to score the goals but the inability to convert the chances has cost the team dear.</p>
      <p>Stimac has no illusion about who is the favourite on Tuesday but he is also hoping that his players will convert the chances which come their way and score goals.</p>
      <p>"Oman are much better now than the team we played against in Guwahati. They are the favourites. We know for a fact that match is going to be very difficult for us," the high-profile Croatian coach said.</p>
      <p>Historically too, India are the underdogs, having not won any of the 11 matches they have played against Oman who have emerged victorious on eight occasions.</p>
      <p>Before the Guwahati match in September, the two sides played out a 0-0 draw in the run-up to the 2019 Asian Cup in the UAE. In the two legs of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers played in 2015, India had lost to Oman 0-3 in Muscat before a 1-2 defeat in Bangalore.</p>
      <p>India will still be without senior central defender Anas Edathodika as he returned home before the Afghanistan match due to a family emergency, dealing a further blow to a team which has lost the services of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sandesh-Jhingan">Sandesh Jhingan</a>, Rowling Borges and Amarjit Singh due to injuries.</p>
