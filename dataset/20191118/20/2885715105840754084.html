      <p>THE FATHER of three-month-old Prince Rajbhar, on Monday, refused to accept Rs 5-lakh cheque as compensation from the BMC, saying the amount will not be sufficient to handle future medical expenses of the baby. Prince underwent amputation earlier this month as a result of a fire incident at KEM hospital’s paediatric intensive care unit.</p>
      <p>Following the demand by several corporators, the civic body decided to offer a cheque of Rs 5 lakh as compensation.</p>
      <p>Prince was admitted to KEM hospital on November 6 for the treatment of a congenital heart defect. On November 7, the ECG nodes attached to the baby’s chest caught fire due to a suspected short circuit. The fire spread to the mattress of the ICU cot and set ablaze the red plastic sheet on which the baby was lying.</p>
      <p>The baby suffered burn injuries on the scalp, the left arm and the shoulder. Four days later, doctors had to amputate his upper left arm to avoid the spread of infection due to the burns.</p>
      <p>On November 13, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> corporator Rajsree Shirvadkar raised the issue at the Standing Committee meeting, demanding compensation for the baby. Her demand was supported by SP corporator and MLA, Rais Shaikh, Standing Committee chairman Yashvant Jadhav and Leader of the House and Sena corporator Vishakha Raut.</p>
      <p>Prince’s father Pannelal Rajbhar, who recently lost his job in Uttar Pradesh, said his son will require multiple surgeries in future and a prosthetic limb. He refused to accept the amount of Rs 5 lakh as compensation.</p>
      <p>The BMC-appointed inquiry committee is slated to submit its report on the incident this week. Dr R N Bharmal, head of the inquiry, said, so far, 25 people had been questioned. “Based on their statements, we will assess whether there was medical negligence or human error that led to the fire,” he said.</p>
