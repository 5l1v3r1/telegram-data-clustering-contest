      <p>Veterinary students have been forced to axe their charity fundraising calendar, after vegan groups attacked them for using sheep to cover their private parts.</p>
      <p>The naked calendar shoot by students at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in London, led to students receiving ‘personal attacks on social media’.</p>
      <p>The photo featured seven final-year male students standing with the animals to cover their genitals, in a practice known as ‘tipping’, which is widely recognised as being ‘safe and pain-free for the animals’, according to the British Cattle Veterinary Association (BCVA).</p>
      <p>The offending image received significant backlash online, following a post by animal rights movement the Veterinary Vegan Network (VVN).</p>
      <p>Subsequently, students received comments that were ‘obscene, threatening and… illegal,’ the RVC said.</p>
      <p>The RVC principal then ordered that the calendar be banned with ‘immediate effect’.</p>
      <p>The calendar will instead be published as planned but the ‘ethically challenged’ image would be removed, according to a RVC spokeswoman.</p>

      <p>In a statement posted on the official college website, RVC principal Stuart Reid apologised to those that had been offended by the calendar, but said that there was ‘no place for harassment or threats” directed at students.</p>

      <p>‘It is with a rather heavy heart that I pen this note to a rather wider readership than I might have anticipated,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘For a number of years, the RVC student body in final year have produced a calendar, a proportion of whose proceeds go to nominated charities.</p>
      <p>‘There can be no denying that in more recent times these activities have started to divide opinion, both within the RVC community and in wider society.’</p>
      <p>Mr Reid added that the college had learnt lessons about ‘the need to understand a changing world’.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘No student is being blamed, individually or collectively, and we will work together to ensure these events do not happen again.</p>
      <p>‘To those who have taken offence at the calendar, I apologise. It may have fallen short of the standards some expect in terms of animal welfare – but that responsibility is mine.</p>
      <p>‘The complaints and attacks should be directed to me and me alone.’</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman added that students affected by the backlash would continue to receive support and that the calendar would still be published on a date to be confirmed.</p>
