      <h1>Vegans sue Burger King over ‘contaminated’ fake meat in Impossible Burger</h1>

      <p>The vegan Impossible Burger isn’t vegan enough at Burger King.</p>
      <p>That’s according to a class action lawsuit vegans are launching at the fast-food chain, which they say grills the meat imitation product on the same grill as its fleshy counterpart.</p>
      <p>The suit, filed by Philip Williams of behalf of other vegans, claims that Burger King has “contaminated” the Impossible Burgers by exposing them to meat byproducts on the grill, according to the suit filed Monday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida.</p>
      <p>BK recently joined a handful of other fast-food chains to offer Impossible Foods, including <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/burger-king-is-adding-impossible-whoppers-to-its-kids-meals/">adding an Impossible Whopper to its kids meals</a>. The growing trend in plant-based options is expected to be a big moneymaker in the restaurant world. The market for products like Impossible Meat’s is expected to top $100 billion in 15 years, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/vegan-plant-based-meat-yields-mouth-watering-profits/">according to JPMorgan Chase</a>.</p>

      <p>According to the suit, Williams ordered the fake-meat burger in Atlanta, where he lives, but was horrified to learn that his burger was grilled on the same surface as the chain’s beef burgers. As a result, he was left with a “meat-free patty that is in fact covered in meat byproduct,” the suit alleges. Williams claims the restaurant gives no indication on their menu that the burgers may be cooked on the meat-touching grills, court papers say.</p>
      <p>Currently, a footnote on the chain’s online menu states, “For guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request.”</p>
      <p>Williams is filing the suit along with several other vegans appalled by Burger King’s alleged cooking practices.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Burger King tells The Post that the company cannot comment on pending litigation.</p>
