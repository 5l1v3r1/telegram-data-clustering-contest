      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/The-Handmaid%E2%80%99s-Tale"><b>The Handmaid's Tale</b></a> gets more and more brutal with each passing season, and so too does the complex relationship between June (<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Elisabeth-Moss">Elisabeth Moss</a>) and Serena Joy )<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Who-Plays-Serena-Joy-Handmaid-Tale-44778559">Yvonne Strahovski</a>). In an exclusive clip from behind the scenes of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Alexis-Bledel-Sitting-Ann-Dowd-Lap-2018-Emmys-45284028">Hulu's award-winning drama</a>, which will be available on Blu-ray and DVD on Nov. 19, we get a closer look at what goes into crafting such an intricate, emotional bond between the characters.</p>
      <p>"Just the power dynamics between a wife and a handmaid are fascinating, complicated, and so malignant and so flammable," series creator Bruce Miller explains. Given that Serena Joy is the wife of Commander Waterford (Joseph Fiennes), to whom June is essentially sold into sexual slavery, her interactions with the handmaid run the gamut of emotional extremes. Luckily the offscreen friendship between Strahovski and Moss only adds to the depth of their performances.</p>
      <p>"It's like the greatest relationship ever. I love it," Strahovski says. "I get so much joy out of working with Lizzie on camera. It's so layered and so complex. This season, the characters have elevated themselves to a new level of no bullsh*t."</p>
      <p>Check out the behind-the-scenes clip above to hear more about what Miller and Strahovski have to say about Serena Joy, then steel yourself for <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Handmaid-Tale-Renewed-Season-4-46426384"><b>The Handmaid's Tale</b>'s dramatic fourth season, due out next year</a>.</p>
