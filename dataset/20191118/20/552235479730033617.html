      <h2>The two clashed on the BBC radio show Sportsound over comments made by Stewart when Alex McLeish was Scotland boss.</h2>

      <p>Former Scotland assistant manager Peter Grant has branded pundit Michael Stewart a liar in an astonishing radio bust-up.</p>
      <p>The Alloa boss launched a furious attack on Stewart over comments claiming <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a> had been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/michael-stewart-claims-leigh-griffiths-13386860">"hammered"</a> in the dressing room after a defeat and his general "negativity" about the Alex McLeish regime.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alex-mcleish">McLeish</a> and Grant were sacked by the SFA after a 3-0 defeat in Kazakhstan and an unconvincing 2-0 win over San Marino started Euro 2020 Group I in disastrous fashion.</p>
      <p>Below is a transcript of the heated exchange between Stewart, Grant and BBC journalist Tom English on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079g4q">Sportsound</a>.</p>
      <p>Grant begins by referring directly to the claims about Griffiths.</p>
      <p><b>Peter Grant:</b> "I think I said it to Michael. I'd never say it by text or phone. I wanted to say it face to face and I was fortunate enough to see him a couple of weeks ago. It was a total lie and I was always led to believe if you are not 100 per cent sure, don't go with what someone else has said, always check before you say anything.</p>
      <p>"I said to Michael and that was it, the end for me because it was a complete and utter lie. It wasn't the fact that he said it, it was the fact that everybody wrote it afterwards."</p>
      <p>"(Michael said Leigh Griffiths) had been slaughtered by the staff, that was the words that were used I think.</p>

      <p><b>Michael Stewart:</b> "Peter brought it up at a Ladbrokes event. I didn't respond due to the fact that he brought it up in front of other people so I appreciate he didn't do it over the phone or a text, but to bring it up in front of some other people who had absolutely no idea what the conversation was about, I decided not to get involved.</p>
      <p>"There's a big difference between telling lies and I'm quite interested to hear him there say you shouldn't say something unless you are 100 percent sure, I'm not a journalist and would never claim to be a journalist but in the journalistic handbook, if you hear something from two independent sources that is confirmation of a story and that is what happened.</p>
      <p>"I heard days after that something had happened in the changing room, that Leigh Griffiths had been slaughtered. I then thought nothing of it.</p>
      <p>"Then three weeks later when there was talk of Griffiths not wanting to be in the squad, I was talking to somebody else and they told me again that something happened in the changing room.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"This is not me fabricating a story, if that was the case I'd hold up my hands and apologise but if I'm recanting a story that two independent sources have told me then that's not a slight on my character and that's what I take umbrage with.</p>
      <p>"When Peter said, 'Michael told lies', he was using it to undermine my opinion on the show about Craig Levein.</p>
      <p>"Now everybody knows I was open and honest about what I thought of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> . I didn't like the guy personally but I offered my professional assessment. Me being honest about that undermined my professional assessment with a lot of people but that was me being honest. I could have lied and tried to hide that but I didn't.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a lie, if it didn't happen...well it's not a lie Peter, you're rolling your eyes there, it's not a lie.</p>
      <p><b>Peter Grant:</b> "If it didn't happen and you said it, it is a lie. Why come out and say it?</p>
      <p><b>Tom English:</b> There's a difference between a lie and an error."</p>
      <p><b>Peter Grant:</b> "No it's a lie is the same thing Tom. Michael has got my number."</p>
      <p><b>Tom English:</b> "A lie is implying malicious intent..."</p>
      <p><b>Peter Grant:</b> "Yes. I think it was."</p>

      <p><b>Michael Stewart:</b> "So you think I was campaigning against Alex McLeish?"</p>
      <p><b>Peter Grant:</b> "No but there was no positives from you in the whole time he was there."</p>
      <p><b>Michael Stewart:</b> "Because I don't think it was positive, my professional assesment. You're suggesting I lied with malicious intent..."</p>
      <p><b>Peter Grant:</b> "I said you lied because you did lie."</p>
      <p><b>Michael Stewart:</b> "I've just explained to you Peter the difference been a lie and...</p>
      <p><b>Peter Grant:</b> "I've worked with you on the TV and we got on fantastically well and I'm thinking, 'Why did he not phone me?'. A problem with Leigh Griffiths in the dressing room? Michael, don't even go there."</p>
      <p>The debate continued back and forth before Grant is asked about an incident where McLeish, "had a problem remembering the team in front of the players".</p>
      <p>Grant denied the story as "rubbish", explaining that McLeish had simply taken unwell. </p>
      <p>He said: "The team was named. We were ready to leave for the match. Alex was going to have a couple of minutes with the boys.</p>
      <p>"The team is already named and everything has been done.  Five minutes before we go we go in to have a final talk with three members of staff and the players.</p>
      <p>"Alex stood up, said something then. 'Excuse me a minute guys' and walked off. He said to me, 'I'm just not feeling right.'</p>
      <p>"It was nothing to do with the team being named or the organisation.</p>
      <p>"The thing that frightened me was by the time we got back the story was out."</p>
