      <h1>Assembly refers Lagos 2020 budget proposal to committee level</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:37:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Lagos State House of Assembly has referred the state’s 2020 proposed budget to the committee stage after it scaled through second reading during plenary on Monday.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports the Appropriation Bill was read for the second time by the Clerk of the House, Azeez Sanni.</p>
      <p>Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had on November 8 presented the 2020 proposed budget of N1.168 trillion to the State House of Assembly.</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu noted that the capital expenditure amounted to N723.75 billion while the recurrent expenditure is N444.81 billion, giving a 62:38 capital to recurrent ratio.</p>
      <p>Commenting, Fatai Mojeed, representing Ibeju Lekki 1, said the proposed revenue was achieveable as the state was yet to tap revenue from several areas of informal sector.</p>
      <p>Mojeed, who spoke on the content of the budget extensively, pointed out various sectors which the budget would touch for the betterment of the people.</p>
      <p>He stated that it would be appropriate for the state to invest heavily on public transportation to be able to cater for the transport need of the people.</p>
      <p>Also commenting, Rotimi Olowo, representing Somolu 1, said that the budget estimate was overambitious, based on its revenue target which might not be achievable.</p>
      <p>Olowo added that there was need to re-integrate the various sectors for better service delivery, saying that it would further enhance the economy.</p>
      <p>He warned the state government not to overtax the people because it wanted to meet revenue target by various agencies and MDAs.</p>
      <p>Olowo said that the current economic situation should be put into consideration while they go about ensuring achieving their revenue targets.</p>
      <p>“The immediate past administration also presented an overambitious budget last year and it failed to achieve its purpose and was poorly implemented at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>“I want this administration to avoid such mistake,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also, Jude Idimogwu, representing Oshodi/Isolo 2, in his comment, called on the MDAs to come and explain to the House on how they would achieve their revenue targets.</p>
      <p>Idimogwu said the figures in the budget were projections but that they should be realistic figures.</p>
      <p>“The MDAs have jacked up their revenue targets, they need to come to tell us how they would realise these projections,” said Idimogwu.</p>
