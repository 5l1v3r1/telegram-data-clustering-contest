      <h2>Hobart Hurricanes wicketkeeper Emily Smith handed hefty sanction for social media post that breached CA's anti-corruption code</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:52:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://twitter.com/JollyLauz18" target="_blank">Laura Jolly</a></address>
      <p>Hobart Hurricanes wicketkeeper Emily Smith has been banned for the remainder of the women's season after contravening Cricket Australia's stringent anti-corruption policy with a social media post.</p>
      <p>Smith posted a video to her personal Instagram account taken from within the restricted Player and Match Official Area (PMOA) of West Park in Burnie on November 2, that included details on the Hurricanes' line-up for their match against Sydney Thunder.</p>
      <p>Team line-up information can be used by individuals betting on games, including 'fantasy' competitions with cash prizes.</p>
      <p>The video was posted about an hour before the scheduled start of play, a statement from CA confirmed. The match was washed out without a ball bowled and no coin toss was possible.</p>
      <p>Smith accepted the sanction for breaching Article 2.3.2 of the anti-corruption code and is ineligible to participate in any form of cricket for one year, with nine months of those suspended.</p>
      <p>The three remaining months will see her ruled out of the remainder of the Rebel WBBL season, while she will also be unable to play in the 50-over Women's National Cricket League.</p>
      <p>Article 2.3.2 of Cricket Australia's Anti-Corruption Code prohibits: "Disclosing Inside Information to any person (with or without Reward) where the Participant knew or might reasonably have known that such disclosure might lead to the information being used in relation to Betting in relation to any Match or Event."</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia's Head of Integrity and Security Sean Carroll said while Smith did not intend to breach the code, players were well aware of their obligations.</p>
      <p>"CA's rigorous anti-corruption player education program means that players are well aware of their obligations under the Anti-Corruption Code and there is no excuse for breaches regardless of the reasons for information being disclosed," Carroll said.</p>
      <p>"Since the commencement of the WBBL, Cricket Australia has had in place a robust anti-corruption program.</p>
      <p>"We have been working with Emily throughout the process and Emily now understands the mistake she made.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, in this instance Emily's actions breached the Anti-Corruption Code. We hope this serves as reminder to all that the Anti-Corruption Code is critical to protecting the integrity of the game."</p>
      <p>Cricket Tasmania said it was reviewing its processes for players and support staff entering the PMOA areas to ensure no such breaches at future matches.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old returned to the Hurricanes for WBBL|05 after two seasons playing with the Perth Scorchers.</p>
      <p>In a twist of fate, it was a different social media platform that helped put Smith on the path to a regular WBBL gig after falling out of favour in her first stint with the Hurricanes in WBBL|01.</p>
      <p>A Facebook message request from the Perth Scorchers coach Lisa Keightly arrived ahead of the WBBL|02 season which saw the native Victorian head west for two seasons.</p>
      <p>"I remember sitting on a couch and I saw a Facebook message request from Lisa Keightley, and I'm a cricket nut, so of course I knew who she was," Smith told cricket.com.au in 2018.</p>
      <p>Originally, the offer was to join the Scorchers' squad for WBBL|02, but a day later Keightley called back to extend the offer to include a WNCL contract with Western Fury as well.</p>
      <p>Under a special exemption, Tasmanian Tigers wicketkeeper Emma Mannix-Geeves has been brought into the Hurricanes squad for the remainder of the current season.</p>
