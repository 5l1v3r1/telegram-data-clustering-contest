      <h1>9 fascinating facts about the Ford Mustang Mach-E</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:26:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Gastelu</a></address>
      <p>As if being <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products">Ford's</a> first purpose-built electric vehicle didn't make it compelling enough, there's more -- plenty more -- to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/electric-ford-mustang-mach-e">Mustang Mach-E</a>. Here are a few of its most interesting facets.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. IT'S REALLY INFUSED WITH MUSTANG DNA.</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Mustang Mach-E isn't all about pony car style. The ride and handling team responsible for the gasoline-powered Mustang tuned the driving characteristics for all of the Mustang Mach-E trim levels to make sure they have the "soul" of a 'Stang. Of course, the top of the line Mustang Mach-E, which can accelerate to 60 mph in under four seconds is practically possessed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. IT ALSO SHARES SOMETHING WITH THE F-150.</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Mustang Mach-E uses a floor-mounted battery pack comprised of pouch-type cells supplied by LG Chem that will be shared with the upcoming <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/supertruck-electric-ford-f-150-debuts-by-towing-a-train">electric F-150</a> and Transit van to save costs. Ford's global product director of electric vehicles, Darren Palmer, says the Mustang Mach-E was designed to be profitable starting with the first one sold.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. IT HAS ITS OWN BAR.</b>
      </p>

      <p>The optional B&amp;O audio system offered on high-end models features a door-to-door dash-mounted speaker setup designed to look like a home audio soundbar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. IT HAS THE OTHER KIND OF BAR.</b>
      </p>

      <p>Since there's no engine under the hood, Ford used the space for a front trunk that's water-resistant and has a drain plug, so you can fill it with ice and your beverage of choice. (Might I suggest V8 juice?)</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. IT LOOKS HARD TO HANDLE.</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/1862/1048/ma9.jpg"/>

      <p>The Mustang Mach-E's doors are opened by pressing a button that pops them out a few inches. The front doors have a tiny handle you can use to pull it the rest of the way, while the back ones feature a grip inside the door panel that's right on the spot Ford discovered a lot of kids used to pull doors open even when there is a handle (there's a stopper that keeps it from closing as you grab it so you don't crush your fingers.) You can even use a smartphone app instead of a button. In the event of an accident, they automatically unlock and have enough charge stored in a capacitor for emergency crews to get them opened, even if the main battery is disconnected.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. IT WON'T MAKE YOU SEE RED.</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>When the Mustang Mach-E is turned off, its taillights turn from red to all white, giving it a unique style in the parking lot.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. IT HAS A SUNNY OUTLOOK</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/1862/1048/ma3.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Some trim levels are available with a full panoramic glass roof, which was a feature on the pre-2015 Mustang.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. IT HAS YOU COVERED</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/1862/1048/ma8.jpg"/>

      <p>One of the Mustang Mach-E's least high-tech features was unique enough to earn a patent. It's a cargo cover that's attached to the hatchback so that it swings up and all the way out of the way and is made from a flexible fabric so you can stuff more of your stuff under it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. THERE'S MORE TO COME</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>There's a black pod mounted on top of the steering wheel that doesn't do anything at the moment, but houses a facial recognition system that will be activated in the future via an over-the-air update along with a hands-free driving system that will work on certain highways that have been 3D mapped for accuracy, similar to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/cadillac-mapped-200000-miles-of-highway-for-its-semi-autonomous-super-cruise">Cadillac's Super Cruise</a>.</p>
