      <h1>Blue Ivy Carter, 7, Is Now an Award-Winning Songwriter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:36:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:36</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Blue Ivy Carter continues to outdo essentially all other seven-year-olds and most adults. Beyoncé's first-born child just won <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/entertainment/bet-soul-train-awards-trnd/index.html">her very first song-writing award</a> at last night's BET Soul Train Awards for "Brown Skin Girl." Blue shares the Ashford &amp; Simpson Songwriter's Award with her co-writers, including SAINt JHN, WizKid, and her mother.</p>
      <p>Sure, this was not a solo effort, but this is <a href="http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28446406/blue-ivy-carter-beyonce-brown-skin-girl-lyrics-reactions/">one of Blue's first forays into songwriting</a>—and it was a bonafide hit. "Brown Skin Girl" <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28562342/beyonce-blue-ivy-carter-billboard-top-100-debut/">charted on the Billboard Hot 100</a>. Blue also sang on the track because she is multi-talented. She is, after all, the child of Beyoncé and Jay-Z; it's in her genes to be this good at music.</p>
      <p>Blue Ivy Carter has not publicly commented on winning her first award, and her parents weren't at the ceremony last night. Blue has more pressing matters to attend to, like studying for second grade.</p>
      <p><i>People </i>got <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28492407/blue-ivy-carter-beyonce-relationship-details/">some details in July</a> about Blue's personality. She's close to her mother and yes, gifted at performing.</p>
      <p>“She is very sassy, high energy and knows what she wants,” a source told the outlet. “Especially after the twins [two-year-olds Sir and Rumi] were born, Beyoncé made sure that Blue was able to embrace her new role as a big sister. She also lets her go to video shoots, award shows and music recording. They have a very special bond!”</p>
      <p>And yes, music is part of it. “Of course both Beyoncé and Blue love music," the source said. "Blue loves singing, dancing and performing. She is a natural.” Clearly.</p>
