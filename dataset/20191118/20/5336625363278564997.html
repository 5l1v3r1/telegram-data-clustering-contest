      <p>Today's lesson in Cooking as a Grown-Ass adult: Blenders are used for more than frozen margs in summer and collecting dust in winter.</p>
      <p>Hot soup without a stove, coffee without a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-single-serve-coffee-makers/">coffee maker</a>, and whipped cream without a hand mixer are just a few of the tasks these multitasking appliances can tackle. Similar to the way the mystical <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-instant-pot-to-buy-recipes-deals-amazon/">Instant Pot</a> replaces a sauté pan or <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-slow-cookers-amazon-crock-pot-instant-pot/">slow cooker</a>, blenders can expand your meal possibilites tenfold without the clutter of multiple machines.</p>
      <h3>Why buy a new blender?</h3>
      <p>In short: Healthy habits made easier.</p>
      <p>Sticking with smart eating habits ain't easy, especially when making a tofu and <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/fast-healthy-seven-quinoa-reci-94978">quinoa casserole</a> with a kale salad on the side takes <i>so</i> much longer than ordering Uber Eats. Blenders simplify meeting that nutrient goal by squeezing them into a 30-second meal replacement. With thousands of recipes online, you're bound to find a balanced combo of greens and fruits that — surprise — you actually look forward to drinking. Smoothies are also an easy wake to imbibe <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/what-is-cbd-where-to-buy/">CBD oil</a>.</p>
      <p>If you're in the habit of buying those drinks from a chain smoothie or juice bar, a blender could save you some serious pocket change. Say you're buying a green juice from <a href="https://www.toprestaurantprices.com/pressed-juicery-prices/">Pressed Juicery</a> every day (skipping the weekends) — at $6.50 each, you're spending around $33 per week and $130 per month. Even a $500 blender would end up paying for itself in a few months.</p>
      <p>Plus, being completely in charge of the contents lets you closely monitor portion size, avoid dietary restrictions like dairy or gluten, and track macronutrients to stay on track with diet goals. Smoothies always <i>seem</i> like a healthy option, but running on fruits or veggies alone <a href="https://time.com/5301984/can-you-eat-too-much-fruit/">isn't the move</a>. Drinks that are truly healthy are ones that have a balance of vegetables, fruit, protein, and fat, and <a href="https://time.com/5447846/are-smoothies-healthy/">dietitians suggest</a> adding things like nut butter, chia, flax, or sesame to help fill you up so you're not going back for a second breakfast later.</p>
      <h3>What separates a Vitamix from a $30 personal blender?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ry0qy">Vitamix Professional Series 750</a> is our top choice for the best blender — but how to more basic options compare?</p>
      <p>Nailing the perfect consistency isn't just pressing a button and walking away. Making something other than smoothies requires a blender with more than two blending speeds to separate thick butters from thin liquids. Built-in programs made for specific recipes also help to hone in on texture and prevent chunks where there shouldn't be chunks.</p>
      <p>Most machines can handle fruits, ice, and leafy greens, but you'll probably want a motor over 500 watts to power through tough ingredients like nuts, whip creamy dips, and create frozen desserts. (Some listings mention <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/the-truth-about-horsepower-in-blenders-and-food-processors/">peak horsepower</a>, which is essentially the initial torque that gets the blades moving. That max power only hits for a short spurt when the blender is turned on, and wattage is a better measurement of the strength the blender keeps over the duration of blending.)</p>
      <p>Blenders are definitely one of the pricier appliances you'll buy in your adult life, but the top-tier ones are durable and should last at least 10 years.</p>
      <h3>So, what are the best blenders to buy for 2019?</h3>
      <p>We're so glad you asked. Keep reading to discover our picks for the best blenders you can buy right now. (And if you're in the market for a Black Friday deal, make sure to keep your eye on these models.) Remember to hit the grey arrow to expand each card and read our in-depth take on each of the listed products. We're off to make a smoothie.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ry0qy?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=1">$599.95 from Amazon </a>Of <i>course</i> a Vitamix is kicking off the list. A 2016 study by <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/blenders/vitamix-blenders-are-worth-the-splurge/">Consumer Reports</a> found that they are indeed worth the splurge: According to data from 30,000 respondents, Vitamix blenders have the lowest problem rate (6%) compared to big names like Breville and Blendtec (15% and 16%). Vitamix also placed the highest in overall satisfaction with reliability, rolling in at a near-perfect 96%. So yeah, they're good.<br/>Now, to figure out <i>which</i> of the 10+ Vitamix models best suits your needs. The Vitamix Professional Series 750 shows up in nearly every "best blenders" list, and it's not hard to see why: With a heavy-duty 1,560 watt-motor and five pre-programmed settings, it's one of the most powerful, straightforward machines out there. Tough veggies and nuts are no match for this machine — the 750 annihilates them.<br/>While cheaper blenders offer two blending speeds and send you off on your own, the Vitamix 750's automated settings (smoothies, hot soups, frozen desserts, purées, self-cleaning) will decrease bouts of trial and error — and ensure that your peanut butter doesn't turn into a peanut butter milkshake. The price is steep, sure, but it's worth every cent.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/m1Vy5?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=2">$139.99 from Amazon </a>We love an appliance that doubles as something else. (It's why we're so obsessed with the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-instant-pot-to-buy-recipes-deals-amazon/">Instant Pot</a>.) The Ninja Mega Kitchen System is officially a blender and a really powerful one at that, but comes with a separate food processing bowl for more labor-intensive steps like mixing cookie or pizza dough. (Two pounds of dough in 30 seconds, to be exact.)<br/>While most premium blenders max out at a 64-ounce blending container, this Ninja uses an XL 72-ounce pitcher. Even with that filled to the brim, Ninja's 1550 watts and Total Crushing Technology has no problem pulverizing ice, frozen fruit, or stubborn greens. The 8-cup food processing bowl is also clutch for making creamy dips, chopping salsas, and more unique textures.<br/>Getting two appliances in one is a great way to save space in your kitchen or expand recipe possibilities, making it an ideal option for families. Oh, except those with newborns or light sleepers — reviews report that it's loud as shit, regardless of the setting. <br/>As for the other Ninja Mega Kitchen System models, the only difference is added accessories. This one (the BL770) doesn't come with anything extra. The BL771 comes with some spare bowls, and the BL772 has an extra single serve cup with lid.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/L1bjm?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=3">$109.99 from Amazon </a>Good looking <i>and</i> smart? This is the blender you want to bring home to your parents. Calphalon wins at kitchen items across the board, but the Auto-Speed blender is one of its most beloved creations. Its powerful 1,100-watt motor will attract experienced foodies who want to make more than smoothies, while the self-adjusting speed and screen interface downs the intimidation factor for newbies.<br/>Instead of guessing the best setting for your recipe, this blender senses the mixture's thickness and automatically applies the appropriate amount of power. (Why don't they all do that?) For even less work on your part, the pulse feature can take care of food prep and chopping — and the reverse pulse feature pulls down ingredients to prevent jams. If you'd prefer more control, four presets let you adjust the speed yourself.<br/>We know it's what's on the inside that counts, but Calphalon found a way to make a stainless steel blender stick out in a sea of stainless steel blenders. A slick, digital screen graces the interface and shows a countdown timer — something most Vitamix blenders don't even have. This blender should be way more expensive than it is, but we're not complaining.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZrdJv?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=4">$109.99 from Walmart </a>Just because fruit smoothies technically have fruit doesn't mean they're healthy. A lot of chain smoothie places add artificial fruit syrups to their drinks, and most of their customers probably don't realize they just consumed a McDonald's meal worth of shitty ingredients. (Smoothie King's "The Hulk" strawberry smoothie reportedly has <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/worst-smoothies/">almost 2,000 calories</a>.) <br/>NutriBullet's smart scale and Balance app measure and log exactly what's going into your blend, helping you make healthier decisions and steer clear of the imposters. Whether it's a concoction you bring in or one of the hundreds of recipes from the app, the built-in scale and nutrition sensor spits back the calories, fat, carbs, sugar, protein, and more.<br/>That data is logged to help you reach diet or fitness goals, and it can even be synced with your phone's health app. It's the closest thing to having a personal nutritionist.<br/>NutriBullets are known for being skinny and easily storable (you know, <i>bullet</i>-shaped), but the Balance cranks out 1200 watts. With more power than some blenders double its size, it's able to give that perf pureé every time without random floaters. Just hit the blend button, replace the blade with a to-go lid, and you're on your way with an Instagram-worthy smoothie.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/NVDVE?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=5">$619.95 from Amazon </a>Sure, a blender with an app is probably overkill if you're only looking to make drinks. But anyone who considers cooking an art rather than a chore will appreciate the craftsmanship of a smart Vitamix, especially if it's something you see yourself using on a daily basis.<br/>Besides the whole "not having to stand at your counter" thing, the true  beauty of a high-tech blender is how customizable food prep becomes. The Ascent series' Blade Base detects the container size, adjusts blend settings accordingly, and stops when it's done. If you want to add your own expertise, variable speed control and a pulsing feature let you fine-tune texture by hand. The machine has five settings built in, but downloading the Perfect Blend app lets you experiment with 17 more programs and over 500 recipes.<br/>The 3500 makes such silky blends, it'd be painful to not take them wherever you go. Luckily, both extra containers come with travel lids — the 8-ounce blending cup can be used for on-the-go baby food or salad dressing, and the 20-ounce blending cup is ace for smoothies in the car cupholder. <br/>Vitamix actually has an entire line of smart blenders. The Ascent series features four models, two of which don't have a touchscreen — and we assumed that if you were down to splurge $500 on an app-connected blender, you'll damn well want the fanciest one there is.</p>

It's a "If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself" kind of thing. Foods where texture matters — like vinaigrette or dressing, chunky salsa, and whipped cream or butter — require extra attention to detail to get the perfect consistency. Pre-programmed settings can do it, but foodies who notice that stuff may prefer to do it by hand with an immersion blender's finer blades.<br/>The Breville Control Grip is the internet's absolute <i>favorite</i> immersion blender. Despite it not being cordless, the ergonomic handle and reduced suction offer seamless directional control, plus a trigger with 15 speeds for you to adjust on your terms. The 280-watt motor pales in comparison to stand blenders, but reviewers claim that the Breville's blades are a beast at crushing ice. It doesn't splatter its pureés, either, so you won't have to worry about flying droplets <i>even</i> with no lid.<br/>Hand blenders on their own have a pretty specific use, but the included attachments up this purchase's versatility. The whisk allows for extra precision for cream, egg whites, or batters, plus there's also a 25-ounce mini food processor. <br/>If you want a cordless one for max freedom, try the <a href="https://zdcs.link/7w1PG">KitchenAid 5-speed hand blender</a>.</p>

Just swap the blade for a lid, and you're on your way without a dirty pitcher.<br/>All you have to do is add your fruit, milk, ice, or whatever else, and a twist of the bottle starts the blending. No buttons also means no fancy presets, but that's almost overkill for a blender that's just used for single servings. A more premium blender may still be on your list to actually make foods like soup or dip, but when you just need a quick single serving, this is easily your most convenient option.<br/>Bonus: The Blend-N-Go does offer personalization with your choice from four bright colors.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Power: 700 watts</li>
        <li>Container size: 40-ounce</li>
        <li>Automated settings: milkshake/easy clean, purée/smoothie, dice/salsa, crush ice/grate</li>
        <li>App-connected: No</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Zrdrg?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=8">$59.99 from Amazon </a>There aren't many blenders for less than $50 or $60 that actually do their job. While you can get away with a cheap coffee maker or hand mixer, the majority of low-budget blenders push ingredients around instead of crushing them, and the shitty three-star reviews prove it. However, Hamilton Beach's Wave Crusher Blending System offers decent power and a nice array of automated blending settings, plus doubles as a food processor and personal blender.<br/>Smooth without stirring (according to the product description) using the Wave-Action system, which offers a one-button start for smoothies, milkshakes, and other drinks in the 40-ounce jar or grab-and-go personal cup. The 700-watt motor struggles with bigger chunks and solid ingredients, but it tackles ice like a boss — and if you're a newbie, that's probably all you're asking for. Plus, a smaller motor means it's noticeably quieter.<br/>Dips, salsas, and similar chunky mixes are also on the menu when you switch to the included food processor cup. Most vegetables, cheese, nuts, and spices are safe to be chopped, but don't expect to make dough. It's a $60 blender, guys.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/L1noO?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=9">$31.44 from Amazon </a>Nutribullet and Oster's personal blenders are great, but there's not always a power outlet conveniently nearby. This mini blender by PopBabies takes portability a step further than to-go cups with a base that's USB rechargeable. This means that all of your camping and road trips can be accompanied by fresh blends (and you can skip small talk in the break room by making smoothies at your desk).<br/>This is hands-down the most no-frills blender in the list, but that's the beauty of it. Just press the button, give it a shake, and you're out the door in 20 seconds. The 175 watt motor isn't for intensive recipes, but ice, fruit, and milk are in the clear. Measurements on the side of the jar also make measuring things like protein powder extra easy.<br/>And don't stress over buying from an obscure brand name — an overwhelming majority of five-star reviews confirm that it's a reliable buy. There are a few look a-like products, but this one has hundreds more customer reviews.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/7wbj7?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=10">$59.99 from Amazon </a>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/7wbj7">NutriBullet</a> has a lower wattage than Ninja personal blenders, but its powerful blades are still able to shred fibrous stalks, tough seeds, pulp, and skin from fruits and vegetables into silky smooth liquids. The blender effortlessly extracts nutrients to make smoothies, juice, and shakes.<br/>There's room for variation when making your concoction as this set comes with two blade types and two different sizes of cups (which include travel lids for on-the-go consumption). You also receive a nutrition guide and recipe book with the NutriBullet, to get the most out of the blender. <br/>This compact blender only has one speed, but it should be powerful enough to handle whatever you throw at it.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/jJGmq?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=11">$129.99 from Amazon </a>Emulsifying fresh ingredients should yield fresh juice or smoothies, but did you know that the quality of your blended drinks can change depending on how you treat your produce during preparation? The <a href="https://zdcs.link/jJGmq">Nutri Ninja blender with FreshVac technology</a> includes a FreshVac pump that is designed to preserve vitamins, flavors, and colors by removing oxygen from your foods before blending.<br/>To get the most out your fruits and veggies, use the pump before adding liquids or blending. The idea is that your beverage should have a smoother texture and richer taste, plus less foam and separation than if you don't remove oxygen from the produce.<br/>Similar to the standard Nutri Ninja with Auto-iQ technology, this blender features a digital timer display and smart programs that combine timed pulsing, blending, and pausing patterns.</p>

      <p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Yrd8x?utm_linkelement=button&amp;utm_ordinal=12">$39.99 from Amazon </a>Not every personal blender is super fancy, nor do they all need to be. If you're looking for something simple and inexpensive that still gets the  job done, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Yrd8x">Magic Bullet</a> is a solid choice. It's designed to chop, mix, blend, whip, and grind. Designed to handle more than just drinks, this little blender can also be used for omelettes, sauces, and dips.<br/>This 11-piece set includes three different blending cups with travel lids for drinking on the go, one of which has a handle for even easier transportation. Also included is a recipe book for guidance on quick, easy creations.<br/>The Magic Bullet is not as powerful as some of the other personal blenders on the market, but it's also not as expensive. Expect to compromise on some of the more advanced features in exchange for a lower price. The most common buyer-reported drawback of this blender is its inability to chop through large ice or frozen fruits.</p>

Just attach one of the two included bottles to the blender's blade, mix up your ingredients, pop the travel lid on, and you're ready to go. Its slim profile makes it ideal for fitting in the cupholder in your car.<br/>This blender is built for safety with a feature that prevents the motor from running unless one of the blending jars is attached to the base. It also has suction feet to secure it to surfaces.<br/>While some reviewers mentioned trouble removing their blending cups from the blender's base, the overall response to the Homgeek blender is positive. It received four stars and an Amazon's Choice badge.</p>

Bonus: the Cozibot also comes with a lid that doubles as a little cup for when you don't want to drink directly from the bottle.<br/>The small blender isn't the most powerful piece of machinery, but it can handle small bits of ice and frozen produce. Fear not if you don't have access to crushed ice; the Cozibot includes a tray to make smaller ice cubes.</p>
