        <b>Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) was left devastated in EastEnders last week when she learned that best friend and confidante Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-mel-owen-dies-surviving-car-explosion-11127193/">had died</a>. However, upon learning that Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) was in her company when she was hit by the lorry, Lisa became hellbent on getting revenge on behalf of her best mate, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-phil-mitchell-discovers-truth-sharon-baby-mel-owen-dead-11126982/">revealed a shocking truth to Phil</a> (Steve MacFadden).</b>
      </p>
      <p>During tonight’s episode, word of Mel’s demise <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/eastenders-spoilers-aftermath-mel-owen-death-11149702/">spread around Walford like hot gossip</a>, and every resident was quick to add their own theory to the mix about how the E20 manager died — not to mention what part Sharon had to play in all of this.</p>
      <p>However, Lisa was certain of what part Sharon played — something which she made very clear last week <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-lisa-fowler-accuses-sharon-mitchell-of-murdering-mel-owen-dead-11126736/">when she called the Mitchell matriarch a murderer</a>.</p>
      <p>Lisa continued to suggest Sharon had something to do with Mel’s death, and Louise (Tilly Keeper) grew incredibly concerned about her mum’s wellbeing as a result.</p>

      <p>After Lisa went to the police station to make a statement, Louise decided to speak to Phil about the whole thing.</p>

      <p>Fuming about the lengths that Lisa’s willing to go to, Phil pushed his way into Mel’s home and proceeded to corner her — in an attempt to intimidate her.</p>
      <p>Phil claimed that she wasn’t right in the head — something which he felt explained her claims of Sharon’s baby not being his — but Lisa stood by her claims. However, Phil was having none of it, and proceeded to threaten her.</p>
      <p>Lisa was left noticeably shaken after the altercation, but whether or not she’ll comply with his request to leave well enough alone remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>We know that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/24/eastenders-star-lucy-benjamin-reveals-all-on-lisa-fowlers-return-10620103/">Lisa’s back for a stint</a>, so could Phil’s threatening behaviour be the catalyst in her departure?</p>
      <p>Knowing how much Lisa cared for Mel, it’s unlikely that she’ll allow Sharon to get off scot free with what happened, which could result in Phil following through with his threats.</p>
      <p>Long-term viewers will remember how Lisa famously shot Phil back in the early ‘00s — in a storyline that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/03/from-den-watts-death-to-lucy-beales-killer-revealed-as-eastenders-reaches-its-6000th-episode-heres-16-well-never-forget-10734058/">became one of EastEnders’ biggest of all time</a> — so perhaps Phil will use the fact that she’s now becoming a thorn in his side to finally seek revenge on her?</p>
      <p>Either way, it’s clear that this conflict is far from over!</p>
