      <p>A 65-year-old cancer patient has registered a case of cheating after an unknown person fraudulently withdrew cash from his bank account, said police. The senior citizen lost Rs 1.4 lakh, which was supposed to go towards his treatment.</p>
      <p>Police suspect it to be a case of card cloning, wherein the accused made use of skimmers and cameras to get the complainant’s account details, following which money was withdrawn using the PIN. Sion police sources said they have identified the senior citizen as Prakash Pawar, whose daughter registered a case on his behalf.</p>
      <p>The complainant told police that the withdrawal took place between November 8 and November 14. “He was going for treatment on November 8 when he withdrew cash from an ATM at Sion circle,” said a police officer, adding the incident came to light on November 15 when he returned to withdraw more cash. “Owing to his illness, the senior citizen couldn’t read the messages. However, when he went back to withdraw, he saw that his account’s balance was zero. He then approached bank officials with his daughter the next day, following which he was informed about the transactions that took place without his knowledge,” said the officer. Sion police recorded their statements and registered a case under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66 (C) and (D) of the IT Act.</p>
      <p>“We are trying to get access to footage captured by CCTV cameras inside the ATM kiosk. We are simultaneously looking for leads through other CCTV cameras installed in the area,” said the officer.</p>
