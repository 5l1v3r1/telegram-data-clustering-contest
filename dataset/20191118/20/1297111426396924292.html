      <h2>A series of mystifying short-yardage play calls sunk the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Sunday's CFL West Division final against Winnipeg.</h2>

      <p>On locker-room clean-out day, the ubiquitous garbage bags should have been filled with copies of the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ offensive playbook, playoff edition.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, how about a bonfire?</p>
      <p>The Roughriders were unable to torch the Winnipeg Blue Bombers’ defence during <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/winnipeg-blue-bombers-dash-saskatchewan-roughriders-grey-cup-hopes-with-20-13-win">Sunday’s CFL West Division final — won 20-13 by the visitors at a sold-out Mosaic Stadium</a> — but perhaps they can ignite something.</p>
      <p>Frustrated fans were certainly inflamed by a series of exasperating play calls when the Roughriders were inside the five-yard line.</p>
      <p>The calls were indefensible — unlike the ill-advised plays that were invariably stuffed by the Blue Bombers during the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>For starters, there was the utter chaos that ensued after Saskatchewan scrimmaged the ball on second down, a mere 1 1/2 yards from pay dirt, with 10-plus minutes left.</p>
      <p>From the moment the Roughriders broke the huddle, with <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/quarterback-bryan-bennett-jumps-at-second-chance-with-saskatchewan-roughriders">Bryan Bennett</a> handling the quarterbacking for the second successive play, there was the feeling that disaster was nigh.</p>
      <p>“Bennett stays in, out of the shotgun,” TSN’s Chris Cuthbert said.</p>
      <p>“Interesting …,” analyst Glen Suitor noted, ominously.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Ideally, Bennett — a short-yardage specialist — would have been crouched behind <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-dan-clark-doesnt-take-o-line-award-for-granted">centre Dan Clark</a>, instead of standing 4 1/2 yards away from the line of scrimmage.</p>
      <p>A quarterback sneak would have sufficed. At worst, the Roughriders would have been in a third-and-one situation after a second-down surge.</p>
      <p>Once Bennett accepted the shotgun snap, he collided with tailback William Powell before being flattened by an untouched Jonathan Kongbo for a four-yard loss.</p>
      <p>Aric Dodd (@darthdodd) put it perfectly on Twitter: “The QB looked like <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/ron-lancasters-legendary-last-game-robs-green-time-machine">Ron Lancaster</a>. More specifically, the statue of Ron Lancaster.”</p>
      <p>Having ingeniously transformed second-and-one-and-a-half into third-and-forget-about-it, the Roughriders settled for a 13-yard <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-brett-lauther-remains-confident-despite-rare-off-day">Brett Lauther</a> field goal that reduced their deficit to 17-10.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg was also ahead by seven (20-13) when Saskatchewan advanced all the way to the three-yard line with under three minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>On first-and-goal, the Roughriders eschewed the run — despite the presence of Powell, a perennial 1,000-yard rusher.</p>
      <p>Compounding the problem, nobody clad in green bothered to lay a finger on defensive end Willie Jefferson, who is merely the West Division’s most outstanding defensive player for 2019.</p>
      <p>Jefferson pressured <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/football-comes-first-for-the-family-of-saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo</a> into a throw-away.</p>
      <p>“This is partly due to respect for the Bombers’ defence against the run,” Suitor told the viewing audience. “I get that.</p>
      <p>“But you’ve got first down inside the five now twice and did not go once to William Powell to see if he could bang it in there. If the Riders don’t win this game, that’s the topic of discussion, guaranteed.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>On second down, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-showing-what-they-can-do-under-offensive-co-ordinator-stephen-mcadoo">offensive co-ordinator Stephen McAdoo</a> finally called for a handoff to Powell, who was inches away from scoring.</p>
      <p>So naturally, on third-and-goal from the one, a handoff to Powell — whose 12 rushing TDs led all running backs during the regular season — was not a consideration.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders called for a sneak — using a quarterback, namely Fajardo, who was playing despite two torn oblique muscles.</p>
      <p>If ever there was a case for turning to Bennett, it was in this situation. But the Roughriders opted to use the injured Fajardo — telegraphing the play for all to see. (Don’t the Houston Astros wish it was that easy to figure out what the opposition was doing?)</p>
      <p>Instead of surging straight ahead, Fajardo ran laterally to his left — even though the left offensive tackle, Terran Vaughn, was out of the game due to injury.</p>
      <p>Bombers defensive back Nick Taylor toppled receiver Manny Arceneaux, who was being used as a blocker, and threw Fajardo off-course. He was then felled by Mercy Maston for a loss of one.</p>

      <p>“There will be a few plays in the red zone that the fan base here in Saskatchewan will be talking about,” Suitor said during the telecast.</p>
      <p>Although images of Sunday’s struggles are still fresh, forehead-slapping play calls aren’t anything new when the Roughriders oppose Winnipeg in post-season action at Mosaic Stadium 2.0.</p>
      <p>Late in the third quarter of last year’s West semi-final, Brandon Bridge — starting at quarterback in place of the injured <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-wish-the-best-for-zach-collaros-except-on-sunday">Zach Collaros</a> — was finally moving Saskatchewan’s offence against a Winnipeg team that ultimately won 23-18.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan had marched 69 yards in nine plays, advancing to the 13-yard line. The ninth play was a 10-yard run by Bridge.</p>
      <p>He was rewarded for moving the yardsticks by being summoned to the sideline.</p>
      <p>Inexplicably, noted non-passer David Watford was in at quarterback for the Roughriders. Watford predictably handed off to Marcus Thigpen, who erupted for a loss of two.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan was then flagged for illegal procedure, creating a second-and-17 predicament.</p>
      <p>Scrimmaging the ball from the 20-yard line, the Roughriders dialled up a pass from Bridge to <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/jordan-williams-lambert-glad-to-be-back-with-roughriders-but-isnt-closing-door-on-nfl">Jordan Williams-Lambert</a>, who caught the ball seven (seven!) yards behind the line of scrimmage. (At least they didn’t give up a safety touch.)</p>
      <p>Paging Brett Lauther …</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Once again, the deployment of the quarterbacks raised eyebrows, if not optimism.</p>
      <p>Bridge was in a groove, for once, so he was temporarily removed from the game. Oh.</p>
      <p>Fajardo had completed four consecutive passes before being spelled by Bennett, who did run for 6 1/2 yards before the ill-fated second-down play left everyone muttering.</p>
      <p>Why is there such an allergy to momentum?</p>
      <p>If a quarterback has a hot hand — especially if he happens to be the division’s newly crowned most outstanding player, as is Fajardo — keep him in the game.</p>
      <p>“I don’t understand that,” TSN’s Milt Stegall said of the Roughriders’ suspect strategy. “Your quarterback is playing well and you put in your backup quarterback.</p>
      <p>“I know hindsight is 20-20, but my starting quarterback is in there on that play.”</p>
      <p>The score, like the hindsight, should have been 20-20.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan had several chances to tie a game with the season on the line, only to chronically falter inside the five-yard line.</p>
      <p>The saddest part of it all?</p>
      <p>The Roughriders, who received a first-round playoff bye as a reward for finishing first in the West, had two entire weeks to concoct a short-yardage blueprint that is best consigned to the bottom of a disposal bin.</p>
