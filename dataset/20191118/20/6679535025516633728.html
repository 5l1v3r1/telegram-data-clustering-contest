      <h1>Delhi air quality likely to be ‘severe’ again by Thursday</h1>
      <h2>Condition may worsen from today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:11:12+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The air quality of the city on Monday was in the ‘poor’ category, and is expected to deteriorate from Tuesday and reach ‘severe’ level by Thursday.</p>
      <p>The increase in pollution levels will be due to slow wind speed and increased affect of stubble burning happening in the neighbouring States, said forecasting agency SAFAR.</p>
      <p>Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Monday was 214 (poor), a notch down from 215 (poor) on Sunday, the CPCB said.</p>
      <p>The average level of PM 2.5 on Monday was 104.3 ug/m3 at 6 p.m., according to the CPCB. The safe limit is 60 ug/m3.</p>
      <p>The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to Delhi’s pollution was 9% on Monday, and is expected to rise to 13% on Tuesday. The contribution was high as 44% earlier this season, stated SAFAR.</p>
      <p>“Pollutant accumulation leading to quick deterioration is predicted by November 20 and probability of AQI touching the lower end of ‘severe category’ on November 21 is high,” SAFAR stated.</p>
