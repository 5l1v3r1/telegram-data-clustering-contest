      <p>Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students staging a dharna near the Jor Bagh metro station on Monday evening said that the police and paramilitary forces resorted to lathi-charge to disperse them.</p>
      <p>JNU students’ representatives were in discussion with the police when the lights suddenly went off and the lathi-charge began, the protesters at the site said.</p>
      <h3>‘Positive atmosphere’</h3>
      <p>“There was a positive atmosphere, we thought the representatives would get to talk to MHRD officials,” said Shezad Ali, who was caught in the attack. “The forces had gheraoed us and just as the representatives were about to go, the lights were cut and it happened.”</p>
      <p>Walking with a limp and his short torn in half, Mr. Ali said that the police carried out the charge with reckless abandon. PhD student Sarbani Chakrobarty said JNUSU leaders were addressing the students when the lathi-charge took place.</p>
      <p>Police personnel present at the protest site, however, said that the lights were not cut off by them and that they had gone off as part of a routine temporary power cut.</p>
