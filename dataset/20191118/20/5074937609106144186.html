      <p>Jasikan (O/R), Nov. 18, GNA - Residents, especially traders and drivers in Jasikan, in the Oti Region have expressed high hopes ahead of the commencement of work on the Jasikan to Dodi Pepesu stretch of the Eastern Corridor road.</p>
      <p>They anticipated the growth of their businesses, comfort in travelling and reduction in expenses on car maintenance and purchase of car spare parts when the construction of the road is done.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the Ghana News Agency ahead of the cutting of sod by the Vice President Alhaji Mahamudu Baeumia on Tuesday, November, 19th 2019, for commencement of work on the stretch, Mr. Edward Apreku, Jasikan Ghana Private Road Transport Union Station Master, said the only problem that was worrying drivers was the poor nature of the road.</p>
      <p>He said the poor state of the road had led to the increase in fares and it had forced drivers to use long routes to avoid the unmotorable short routes, adding that the Union was likely to reduce fares once the road was constructed.</p>
      <p>Mr Apreku called on government to put in measures to ensure that the contractor remained on the road after the official breaking of grounds.</p>
      <p>Mr Ayuba Issaka, a driver on the Jasikan to Kadjebi road, said the poor nature of the road had increased the cost of maintenance. </p>
      <p>Madam Fati Zakari, a trader, said most drivers had diverted routes due to the poor nature of the road and this had led to decreased in her sales and also lamented the difficulty in getting their goods transported.</p>
      <p>She said the construction of the road would enable her and other traders to get their goods patronized, since passengers and drivers would come back on the road.</p>
      <p>The Government, through the Ministry of Roads and Highways and the Ghana Highway Authority are scheduled to perform a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of work.</p>
      <p>GNA spotted an Nkwanta to Ho bound Metro Mass Transit Limited bus with registration number AS 5662 Z stuck in the mud on Monday.</p>
      <p>The passengers, visibly tired and frustrated by the situation refused to talk to the GNA on their views on the commencement of work on the road. </p>
