      <p>Momoa, 40, is a big fan of British Columbian death metal band Archspire. He reached out and asked Peters to help him perfect the war cry.</p>
      <p>“Jason has such an interest in music and has done aggressive acting scenes before, so he was a quick learner for this,” Peters told <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/see-heavy-metal-vocalist-interview-1202190546/"><i>IndieWire</i></a>. “We spent time getting him familiar with what the vocal style is and were messaging back and forth while Archspire was on tour.”</p>

      <p>“When we hung out on sets, in between takes I’d come over to him and we’d go over the lines together,” Peters continued.</p>
      <p>Peters and Archspire drummer Spencer Prewett actually made a cameo in the Apple TV+ series where they briefly appeared during Momoa’s war cry scene.</p>
