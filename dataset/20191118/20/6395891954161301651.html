      <p>Company officials told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday it has stopped donating to the organizations, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/chick-fil-a-drops-donations-to-christian-charities-after-lgbt-protests.html">according to CNBC</a>.</p>
      <p>“We made multiyear commitments to both organizations, and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018,” a Chick-fil-A spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Both organizations oppose same-sex marriages.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A President and COO Tim Tassopoulos also <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/retail/exclusive-amid-global-expansion-and-lgbt-pushback-chick-fil-a-changes-charitable-giving-structure-101818">told Bisnow</a> the Paul Anderson Youth Home in Vidalia, Georgia, would no longer be funded by the company.</p>
      <p>“There’s no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are,” Tassopoulos told Bisnow. “There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message.” </p>
      <p>Anderson, a Toccoa, Georgia, native, started the Paul Anderson Youth Home after he won Olympic weightlifting gold in the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia.  </p>
      <p>In a statement released Monday afternoon, Chick-fil-A said it would give $9 million “in a more focused giving approach” to Junior Achievement and Covenant House International. It will also give and $25,000 to a local food bank at each new Chick-fil-A opening. </p>
      <p>The company will also continue to provide scholarships to its employees.</p>
      <p>In 2012, then-Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/chick-fil-president-says-company-opposes-gay-marriage/ffm1qY79nE1woMjrx6R8FL/">told a Baptist website</a> the Atlanta-based restaurant chain is "guilty as charged" in its support of traditional marriage. Cathy is now CEO of the company, which has become the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/chick-fil-officially-the-third-largest-restaurant-chain-america/9S4WdRx4JH9legWivpOUkN/">third-largest fast-food chain</a> in the nation and one that <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/chick-fil-drive-throughs-now-slowest-among-big-chains-study-finds/kgelHWr6c6bdF93d2gjb8N/">consistently ranks high</a> on numerous customer-satisfaction surveys.</p>
      <p>A Chick-fil-A restaurant that opened in the United Kingdom amid protests against the company’s opposition to same-sex marriage will close when its lease expires in 2020.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://centralusa.salvationarmy.org/indiana/faq/">The Salvation Army’s website</a>, it does not discriminate or refuse to provide services to gay and lesbian people seeking assistance, though it has joined in solidarity with other organizations that support the definition of “traditional marriage.”</p>
