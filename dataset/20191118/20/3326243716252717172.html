      <p>Remember <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/15/ifixit-live-16-inch-macbook-pro/">last week</a> when the <i>iFixit</i> team started their teardown treatment of the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/13/official-16-inch-macbook-pro/">brand new</a> 16-inch <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, aiming primarily on the new keyboard? Well they did that, and now the process is done and published.</p>
      <p>If you like teardowns, then <i>iFixit</i> is typically the first stop when it comes to checking out the internals of the newest pieces of technology. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is certainly no different, especially considering Apple included a “new” scissor switch “Magic Keyboard” in the newest laptop, along with some other key changes under the hood.</p>
      <p>The keyboard is where we’ll start, and it <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106">looks like</a> the company relied on what worked in the past. Indeed, Apple has used a scissor switch style that looks almost identical to what was used in MacBook Pro models before the butterfly switch was invented. However, the teardown does show that the new scissor switches are at least a little thinner than previous iterations.</p>

      <p>There isn’t any dust-proofing membrane here, either. That should tell us that, despite the failings of the butterfly keyboards prior, Apple is pretty confident in this keyboard design.</p>
      <p>The battery in the new MacBook Pro measures in at 99.8Wh, which is the largest a battery can be in a laptop and still get carried on a plane. It’s the largest battery ever in a MacBook Pro, and it’s 16.2Wh increase over the battery in the now discontinued 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>The full breakdown of the teardown is absolutely worth a look if you’re into that sort of thing. The repairability score is a 1 out of 10, though. Which isn’t great, but not all that surprising, either.</p>
      <p>Did you get yourself a new 16-inch MacBook Pro? If so, are you happy with the purchase so far?</p>
