        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/the-flash">“The Flash”</a> star <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/danielle-panabaker">Danielle Panabaker</a> spoke to Insider about her experience directing season six, episode six of <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/the-cw">The CW</a> show (“License to Elongate”), which airs on Tuesday.</li>
        <li>Panabaker, who plays Caitlin Snow/Killer Frost, said that her <a href="https://twitter.com/dpanabaker/status/1095456307853746176">directorial debut</a> last season was “nerve-wracking,” but she “definitely felt more confident this season.”</li>
        <li>She continued: “Going into my second time directing, I felt like I also had less to prove, because the first time I directed, I really wanted to show everyone how seriously I was taking it and how prepared I was.”</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/danielle-panabaker">Danielle Panabaker</a> says she “felt more confident” during her second time directing an episode for season six of <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/the-flash">“The Flash.”</a></p>
      <p>“The first time you do anything, it’s a little nerve-wracking,” Panabaker, who stars as Caitlin Snow/Killer Frost on <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/the-cw">The CW</a> show, told <a href="https://www.insider.com/">Insider</a>. “You can be as prepared as you want, but you never know.”</p>
      <p>The actress made her <a href="https://twitter.com/dpanabaker/status/1095456307853746176">directorial debut</a> during season five, episode 18 of the comic-book series (titled “Godspeed”) and will once again get behind the camera for Tuesday’s episode (“License to Elongate”).</p>
      <p>“I definitely felt more confident this season,” Panabaker told us.</p>

      <p>She continued: “Going into my second time directing, I felt like I also had less to prove, because the first time I directed, I really wanted to show everyone how seriously I was taking it and how prepared I was.”</p>
      <p>“I think, rightfully so, a few people were skeptical at first,” Panabaker added. “And now that it was my second time around, people really trusted that I knew what I was doing, and was capable of hopefully giving the best version of that script possible.”</p>

      <p>In addition to directing a season six episode, the actress also told us that <a href="https://www.insider.com/the-flash-danielle-panabaker-killer-frost-new-suit-season-six-interview-2019-10">Killer Frost’s new suit was originally supposed to be worn during the previous season</a>. As the current season progresses, fans will get to see Killer Frost, the icy superhero counterpart of Panabaker’s character, “live a full-fledged life” outside of fighting crime with Team Flash.</p>
