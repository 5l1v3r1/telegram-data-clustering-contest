      <h1>Plea to extend Kozhikode-Bengaluru trains to Kasaragod</h1>
      <h2>Time to address needs of commuters between Mangaluru and Kannur, says passengers’ association</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:22:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The Kasaragod Railway Passengers Association has demanded that the Southern Railway extend the new train services between Kozhikode and Bengaluru to Kasaragod.</p>
      <p>The association also took strong exception to the Railways ignoring issues facing passengers. R. Prashanth Kumar, member, Palakkad Railway Division Advisory Committee, reminded the Southern Railway and the Palakkad Division that neither Kozhikode nor Kannur was the border of Kerala, and that there was a huge population commuting between Mangaluru and Kannur.</p>
      <p>“The Railways should start new services benefiting all passengers. However, the services ending in Kozhikode amount to neglecting passengers from Kasaragod and Kannur,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kumar added that there was a huge migratory population that prefers train to bus owing to escalating ticket costs and poor road conditions. He pointed out that the Palakkad Division was also operating services like Alappuzha-Kannur Executive (daily) Express and Ernakulam-Kannur (daily) Intercity Express that end at Kannur. Both trains resume services after 16 hours of halt at the station.</p>
      <p>In the absence of MEMU trains, long-distance services are the only solace for passengers. Every month, bigger stations like Kasaragod, Kanhangad and Payyanur register a collection of around ₹5 crore. The Railways cite lack of tracks or space to accommodate more trains for the delay in extending services. However, the available space at Mangaluru Junction could be considered in such a scenario, Mr. Kumar said.</p>
