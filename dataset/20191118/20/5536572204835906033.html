      <h1>Colin Kaepernick’s Sends Workout Video To All 32 NFL Teams</h1>

      <p>Colin Kaepernick has not thrown a pass in the NFL since the 2016 season, but that hasn’t stopped his pursuit of trying to get back into the league.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, who started a national controversy when he began kneeling during the Anthem, threw scripted passes for about an hour at an Atlanta high school for eight teams scouts that came out to see him.</p>
      <p>An NFL executive told ESPN his arm talent was “elite” and that he “threw the ball well.” He wanted to make sure that all teams saw what he could do, so he sent his workout video to all teams in the league, according to TMZ.</p>

      <blockquote>“Sources connected to Kap tell us turning the video around quickly was a priority and they had it out within 24 hours of the Atlanta workout.<br/><br/>We’re told Colin also sent a note to each team saying he’s ready, willing and able to visit with any team for an interview and/or workout (as teams usually do) if there’s real interest.<br/><br/>Of course, the most important thing for Team Kap is making sure decision-makers get a chance to see Colin’s skills for themselves so they can quickly evaluate him and hopefully make an offer.”</blockquote>
      <p>Following the workout, Kaepernick delivered a message to all owners and even Roger Goodell.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re waiting for the 32 owners, the 32 teams, Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running. Stop running from the truth, stop running from the people. We’re out here, we’re ready to play, we’re ready to go anywhere.”</blockquote>
