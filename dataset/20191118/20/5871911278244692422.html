      <h1>Antonio Brown teases crazy new workouts, hints at NFL return in video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:24:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>It’s currently unclear if Antonio Brown will be back on the football field this season, but the clock is ticking, and he’s running out of time.</p>
      <p>AB is currently facing a legal issue, and he also proved to be a massive headache for the Raiders, which resulted in him playing for two teams in the same month, but released not too long after.</p>
      <p>Brown hasn’t played in an NFL game since Sept. 15, and he’s hoping that streak comes to an end soon. AB posted a video showing off some of his new workouts, and essentially begged teams to give him (or his agent) a call.</p>

      <p>It’s hard to see any playoff-caliber team inviting a distraction such as AB into their locker room, but crazier things have happened.</p>
