        <b>A REAL-life Santa Claus who decorated his house with 3000 lights to honour his wife’s dying wish has lost his own fight for life.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Davie Brown, 63, first dressed as Santa and put on the show in 2007 to cheer up Ann, who had lung disease COPD.</p>

      <p>Every year families from all over would visit the couple’s wonderland in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian.</p>
      <p>And despite reeling from the loss of Ann at 68 in August last year, Davie made sure he continued the annual tradition after she begged him to keep it going.</p>
      <p>But Christmas 2018 <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/3582548/santa-christmas-lights-bonnyrigg-edinburgh-david-brown/">was to be the last time the charity champion thrilled locals</a> with his festive extravaganza after loved ones announced his death last week aged 64. It’s believed he had been ill for some time.</p>
      <p>Laura Jane Rushforth said: “My family would like to thank everyone for the kind words and support! The street will never be as bright as it was with him in it!”</p>
      <p>Hundreds of tributes poured in for the ex-miner - whose efforts helped raise thousands for Marie Curie cancer charity.</p>
      <p>Visitor Jenn Rae said: “This is heartbreaking. Davie was such an amazing man and did massive amounts for Marie Curie.</p>

      <p>“I was absolutely gutted when I found out last year would be the last of his lights. I hope he can rest in peace now he is reunited with his wife.</p>
      <p>“Such sad news.</p>
      <p>“RIP Davie you will be sadly missed by those who knew your kindness.”</p>
      <p>And Penny Andrews said: “You made hundreds of children smile. Such a lovely man and he has left behind a legacy.</p>
      <p>Thank you for everything you did for a very worthwhile cause. Rest in peace Davie. Bonnyrigg won’t be the same without your Christmas spirit “</p>
      <p>Dedicated Davie would hand out sweets to children and collect their letters bound for the North Pole.</p>
      <p>In December 2018, he put on his largest display ever and wore his Santa costumer every day in December as a tribute to Anne.</p>
      <p>He pulled out all the stops and built a Cinderella-style carriage from scratch, complete with six rocking horses, which were named by children living nearby.</p>
      <p>He also stepped up the Christmas lights by another 1,400 on top of the 1,600 which were lit up in 2017.</p>
      <p>It’s believed his decorations have been placed elsewhere in the community so locals can continue to enjoy his work.</p>
