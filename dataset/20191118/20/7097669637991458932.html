      <h1>The New York Times report on China's mass detention of Muslims seems to have broken through Beijing's internet firewall</h1>

      <p>The Great Firewall may have been breached.</p>
      <p>Beijing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-leak.html">doubled down</a> Monday after <i>The New York Times</i> published <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879047/government-leak-highlights-chinas-crackdown-muslims">a report</a> on over 400 leaked documents that provided a look into China's mass detention of Muslims in the Xinjiang region, though the government didn't dispute the authenticity of the documents.</p>
      <p>"It is precisely because of a series of preventative counterterrorism and de-extremism measures taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been deeply plagued by terrorism, has not had a violent terrorist incident for three years," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-leak.html">said</a> Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Geng <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-leak.html">added</a> that the <i>Times</i> took things out of context in an attempt to "smear and discredit China's antiterrorism and de-extremism capabilities."</p>
      <p>But aside from Geng's comments, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-leak.html">the <i>Times</i> reports</a> that Chinese state media said little else about the issue, which is not surprising given the sensitive nature of the issue. But there were signs that at least some aspects of the leak snuck past Beijing's internet firewall, which blocks access to the <i>Times</i>. One user on Chinese social media platform Weibo reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-leak.html">posted</a> about Wang Yongzhi, an official cited in the report who initially helped implement China's harsh measure, but eventually ordered the release of more than 7,000 detention camp inmates before he was arrested. "History will not forget this person and this page of paper," the Weibo user <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslims-leak.html">wrote</a>, indicating that the documents might have made their way through.
