      </p>
      <p>Human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), argued on Monday that the National Assembly lacked the legislative competence to pass the controversial bill for the establishment of Hate Speech Commission.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement that hate speech being “a residual matter”, the bill would encroach on the legislative autonomy of the state governments.</p>
      <p>He threatened legal action to challenge the constitutionality of the bill if it is passed by the National Assembly and signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>The bill which has passed the first reading at the Senate provides varying degrees of penalties including capital punishment for violation of different provisions of the proposed law.</p>
      <p>Falana maintained on Monday that hate speech was not an item on either the Exclusive or Concurrent Legislative Lists in the Nigerian Constitution, therefore the National Assembly lacked the power to legislate on it.</p>
      <p>He stated, “The power of the National Assembly to make laws for the peace, order and good governance of the federation of any part thereof cannot be exercised at large.</p>
      <p>“By virtue of section 4 of the Constitution, the power of the National Assembly to make laws is limited to matters in the Exclusive Legislative and Concurrent Legislative Lists.</p>
      <p>“To the extent that hate speech is not covered by both Legislative Lists the National Assembly cannot pass any hate speech bill.”</p>
      <p>He added, “Finally, even though the obnoxious bill is the initiative of a member of the House of Representatives, the Buhari administration has adopted it hook, line and sinker.</p>
      <p>“The constitutional validity of the bill will certainly be challenged in the Federal High Court if it is passed by the National Assembly and assented to by President Buhari.”</p>
      <p>Falana noted that on the grounds that Nigeria was operating a federal system of government, the Supreme Court of Nigeria had declared in several cases that the National Assembly lacked the constitutional powers to make laws outside its legislative competence</p>
