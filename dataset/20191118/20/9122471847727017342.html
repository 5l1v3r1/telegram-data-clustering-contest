      <h1>Scott Frost Not Happy With Nebraska’s ‘Leadership’ This Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:06:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska’s potential breakout season never materialized. The Huskers are 4-6 on the year and need to win their final two games to reach a bowl.</p>
      <p>There have been several reasons for Nebraska’s struggles. Today, head coach Scott Frost took aim at his team’s leadership, or lack thereof.</p>
      <p>While meeting with the media this afternoon, Frost made some pointed remarks about leadership not being “where we needed it to be” because a few people (presumably players) are “working against that.”</p>

      <p>Well, this isn’t what you want your head coach to be talking about with two weeks left in the season. Frost has a lot of issues in his program that he needs to iron out.</p>
      <p>He should have plenty of time to do that. Over the weekend, Frost signed a two-year contract extension, locking him in in Lincoln through December 31, 2026.</p>
      <p>Nebraska will travel to Maryland this weekend. The Huskers need to beat the Terps, then beat Iowa in the regular season finale to qualify for a bowl game.</p>
      <p>Nebraska has finished 4-8 each of the last two seasons and has not reached a bowl since 2016.</p>
