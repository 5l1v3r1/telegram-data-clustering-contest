      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> on Monday rejected “Pharma Bro” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/martin-shkreli-controversies-a-timeline-of-events">Martin Shkreli’s</a> bid to overturn a 2017 conviction for securities fraud and conspiracy, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Shkreli, 36, was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-for-defrauding-investors">sentenced in 2018</a> to seven years in prison for securities fraud after he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-for-defrauding-investors">scammed investors</a> out of millions.</p>

      <p>He also made headlines for raising the price of the anti-parasite drug Daraphim – it helps AIDS and cancer patients – by 5,000 percent when he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>Shkreli argued that negative publicity had undermined his defense, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-shkreli-idUSKBN1XS219?taid=5dd2d274918b1f0001857b01">Reuters</a>. He also argued that a $7.36 million forfeiture for cheating investors was excessive, the report said.</p>

      <p>“We are disappointed by the court’s decision and continue to main that Martin was never treated fairly by any of the courts that have reviewed his case,” said Benjamin Brafman, Shkreli’s defense attorney. “Unfortunately, there is often a price to pay for notoriety. It is never helpful.”</p>
