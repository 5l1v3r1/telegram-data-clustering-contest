      <h2>US expected to ease postion on Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria</h2>

      <p>The Trump Administration is expected to make a dramatic change in American policy towards Judea and Samaria Monday, according to <i>Channel 13 News</i> correspondent Barak Ravid.</p>
      <p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will make an announcement in which he is expected to declare that 'settlements,' or Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, do not violate international law.</p>
      <p>The move would reverse the 1978 legal opinion of the State Department that Israeli settlements are illegal.</p>
      <p>New Right Co-Chairwoman Ayelet Shaked praised the Trump Administration's move as "an important and significant decision."</p>
      <p>The former justice minister added, "It is indeed better late than never. Settlement in Judea and Samaria does not contradict international law and it is good that the world's great power is telling the truth and correcting a long-standing injustice."</p>
      <p>Transportation Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded on Twitter: "This is certainly a worthy answer to the European Court's hypocritical <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271528">decision</a> from last week. We are advancing in international recognition of the settlement enterprise."</p>
