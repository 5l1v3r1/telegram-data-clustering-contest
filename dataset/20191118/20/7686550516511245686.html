      <p>The funeral of a huge sports fan who died on a charity climbing trip to Everest has been held at the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/principality-stadium">Principality Stadium</a> .</p>
      <p>A black hearse carrying the coffin of Kellinu Portelli pulled up on the riverfront walkway directly outside the entrance to the Riverside Terrace at the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff</a> stadium.</p>
      <p>The coffin was surrounded by floral arrangements including one that spelled out 'My Bro' in white flowers.</p>
      <p>Mourners followed the cortege as its made its way up the iconic paved walkway for what is thought to be the first ceremony of its kind at the stadium.</p>
      <p>The funeral party entered the rooms overlooking the River Taff to American singer John Legend's All of Me.</p>
      <p>Mr Portelli, 54, of Leckwith, Cardiff, had been suffering from low blood oxygen levels on his trip and was found dead at base camp.</p>
      <p>The dad of Lucia, 26, and Sam, 20, and grandfather to Luca had been raising money for cancer charity Marie Curie after losing his mother-in-law and a close friend to the disease.</p>
      <p>His wife Donna, 50, said at the time: "I said to him just be careful and he said: 'I will be careful I promise'</p>
      <p>"That night there was a festival on and Kell was dancing and singing with locals and then he went to bed.</p>
      <p>"In the morning the guide said he went to get him but he died in his sleep."</p>
