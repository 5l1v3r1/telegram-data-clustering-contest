      <p>If there was any beef between Bella Hadid and Selena Gomez, it has been squashed.</p>
      <p>Hadid reportedly reached out to Gomez to make peace after fans blew an Instagram post out of proportion, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/bella-hadid-selena-gomez-instagram-deletion-no-feud/"><i>TMZ</i></a>. Gomez commented on a photo of Hadid with an innocent enough comment: “Stunning.”</p>

      <p>Hadid reportedly did not reply to Gomez’s comment or follow her back. Hadid later deleted the post entirely. It was re-posted by a fan account and Gomez commented “that sucks,” with a crying emoji.</p>
      <p>The supermodel reportedly reached out to the “Wolves” singer to clear things up. Hadid, 23, insisted there was no bad blood with Gomez, 27, and she simply deleted the photo because she did not like it.</p>

      <p>“NO. I shouldn’t have spoken without knowing the truth. I’m sorry. Please don’t be hurtful,” Gomez wrote in a separate comment, per <a href="https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1094671/selena-gomez-defends-wonderful-person-bella-hadid-over-deleted-instagram-post"><i>E! News</i></a>. “She is a wonderful person and it was all a misunderstanding.”</p>
      <p>A lot of the rumoured feud was fueled by the fact that Gomez briefly dated Canadian singer The Weekend between his on-and-off relationship with Hadid.</p>
