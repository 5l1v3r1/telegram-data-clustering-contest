      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:02:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:02</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Former Super Eagles’ goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme, will in a few days unveil his new book, titled; ‘Why Not Me?”</p>
      <p>The erstwhile Wolverhampton Wanderers star disclosed this via his Twitter handle: @Carl_Ikeme, on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I’m pleased to announce that my new book will be coming soon!!! Full details in the next few days…,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>Ikeme, who made his international debut for Nigeria in a 2017 AFCON qualifier against Tanzania, could not make it to the AFCON and World Cup finals due to cancer treatment.</p>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers announced that Ikeme had been diagnosed with acute leukaemia after returning abnormal blood tests during a routine pre-season check-up.</p>
      <p>Ikeme finally retired from football on medical grounds. </p>
      <p>The team’s new goalkeeper Rui Patrício left the number one jersey vacant in Ikeme’s honour, choosing 11 instead.</p>
