      <h1>Darius Slayton is turning into Dave Gettleman’s ‘special’ draft steal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:36:09+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:36</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Botte</a></address>
      <p>Odell Beckham Jr. was unceremoniously traded in the offseason. Golden Tate was suspended for the first four games as his replacement for violating the NFL’s policy on performance-enhancing substances. Sterling Shepard has missed six games this season with multiple concussions.</p>
      <p>All of those factors <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/09/darius-slayton-gets-a-boost-in-expanded-giants-role/">have provided ample opportunity</a> for Darius Slayton, the Giants’ fifth-round draft pick out of Auburn, to get on the field consistently as a rookie.</p>
      <p>He has made the most of those chances and emerged as a rare bright spot in another lost season for the Giants, leading them with five touchdown receptions and 14.6 yards per catch as they come out of their bye week and prepare for Sunday’s road game against the Bears.</p>
      <p>“I’ve definitely done my best to seize every opportunity I’ve been given and I think I’ve done a pretty solid job of that so far. Hopefully it will be able to continue,” Slayton told The Post after Monday’s practice. “I just want to keep being consistent, just keep making plays when the ball’s thrown my way.</p>
      <p>“Every time I go out there, I’m just trying to find ways to help my team win, whether I’m putting the ball in the end zone or blocking. Anything I can do.”</p>
      <p>The 6-foot-1 Slayton has provided an immediate, if unexpected, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/02/giants-darius-slayton-thriving-and-using-draft-snub-to-silence-skeptics/">return on his draft status</a>, emerging as a legitimate find for GM Dave Gettleman and coach Pat Shurmur through 10 games. His five scoring plays, including two in a loss to the Jets before the bye, are tied for the most by any rookie receiver in the league alongside Seattle’s D.K. Metcalf, Kansas City’s Mecole Hardman and Washington’s Terry McLaurin — all of whom were selected in the first three rounds.</p>

      <p>“He’s come on the scene and made a name for himself,” Tate said of Slayton. “I think he’s doing that each and every week, he’s helping us, for sure. He’s brought another dynamic. He’s showing he can manage his load, and he can handle that. I think he’s a special player already, but I’m really excited for the future for him. Once he understands the game more, when the game slows down a little bit more for him, I think he’s gonna be even more dangerous than he is now.</p>
      <p>“He’s already an impact player, very explosive and can do a lot of things. To get into the end zone five times, as a rookie, that’s special. That’s been very impressive.”</p>
      <p>Slayton, 22, notably has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/19/giants-darius-slayton-on-being-a-nerd-ease-of-playing-with-daniel-jones/">developed an instant rapport</a> with fellow rookie Daniel Jones. All 27 of his catches – including a career-best 10 on 14 targets against the Jets — have come from Jones. Slayton, who battled injuries for most of training camp and the preseason, missed the first two games of the season that Eli Manning started.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely helped that we came in side-by-side, with a chance to learn and go through these rookie growing pains together,” Slayton said. “I hope we’re together a long time.”</p>
      <p>Slayton said the same about Shepard, who returned to practice Monday, although it remains too early to tell whether he will return to the lineup in Chicago.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, we’re a better team with him on the field than without him,” Slayton said. “We came into this season and he kind of was our guy. Not having him around has been tough. Obviously, we’ve all had to step up and make plays, but he’s a hard guy to replace. It’ll be huge to have Shep back.</p>
      <p>“But it’s tough, with the head stuff. It’s not a sprained ankle or anything like that, so that’s why you have to be really careful with it. I’m happy that he’s feeling better now and look forward to being on the field with him together.”</p>
