      <p>In short, all of the Disney shows and movies that have already been released. You can cry through all four “Toy Story” movies, learn about the world around you through a Nat Geo documentary, and satisfy your comedic itch with an episode of “The Simpsons.” You’ll have access to classics like “Snow White” along with recent hits like “Black Panther.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> also includes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-shows-disney-plus">all-new, exclusive original programming</a>, such as a “Star Wars” TV series focused on a Mandalorian bounty hunter, a retelling of “Lady and the Tramp” featuring Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux, and a new perspective on the familiar objects in our lives through “The World According to Jeff Goldblum.” The strong lineup of original Disney content alone could make a Disney Plus subscription worth it.</p>
      <h3>When is the release date for <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a>?</h3>
      <p><a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> is now live and available to stream. It launched on November 12, 2019.</p>
      <h3>How does <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> compare to other streaming services?</h3>
      <p>While services such as Netflix and Hulu cast a wide net over movie and TV entertainment, Disney Plus is much more focused and narrow in scope by revolving entirely around Disney content. Luckily, it doesn’t actually feel that limited since Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television create everything from animated <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kids-movies-on-disney-plus">kids’ movies</a> to action and sci-fi thrillers. At this point, it’s difficult to find someone who isn’t a Disney fan in some capacity – with Disney Plus, there’s a movie or series for everyone.</p>
      <p>It’s a major plus that Disney Plus (for the time being) is launching with zero ads. We don’t know whether that will change down the line, or whether it will add tiered ad pricing like some other streaming services, but in the meantime, we always appreciate ad-free streaming.</p>
      <p>At less than $10 a month, it’s very affordable compared to major competitors. If you find the Disney content of other streaming services lacking, subscribing to Disney Plus is an affordable way to fix that problem.</p>
      <p>Of all the major streaming services, it’s also the most generous in the areas of multiple-device streaming and profile additions. You can stream on up to four devices simultaneously and add up to seven profiles.</p>
