      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For Chiefs-Chargers Tonight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:56:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The NFL heads to Estadio Azteca in Mexico City tonight as the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday Night Football. It’s only the third time ever that a game is being played in Mexico, and it should be a good one.</p>
      <p>Kansas City comes into this game with a narrow edge over the Oakland Raiders in the AFC West. If they want to avoid giving Oakland the lead and playing catchup, they’ll need reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes at his very best.</p>
      <p>Standing in their way are the 4-6 Los Angeles Chargers, who have almost played every game close this season. Two of their wins and all six of their losses have been decided by a touchdown or less. A Chargers win would put them within one game of the AFC West heading into their bye.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128134">ESPN’s computer model</a> has released its prediction for the Chiefs-Chargers game.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer model believes that Kansas City should win the game. The computer model gives the Chiefs a 73.5-percent chance to win tonight’s game.</h3>
      <p>Last year, the two teams played a pair of high-octane games, scoring 122 points and 16 touchdowns over eight quarters. With the bright lights of Mexico City on, we can probably expect more of the same this year.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 8:15 p.m. EST on ESPN.</p>
