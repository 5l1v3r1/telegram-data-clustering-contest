        <b>The multimillion-dollar Manchester Municipal Corporation fraud trial had to be postponed today because of the unavailability of a courtroom.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Porus Court was this morning packed to capacity with matters that were transferred from the Manchester Parish Court, resulting in the postponement.</p>
      <p>A section of the Manchester courthouse was recently destroyed by fire which resulted in cases being transferred to outstations in Porus and Christiana. </p>
      <p>Judge Desiree Alleyene extended the bails of the accused and rescheduled the matter for tomorrow in Porus. </p>
      <p>On trial are Sanja Elliott, a former official at the Manchester Municipal Corporation, his wife Tashagay Goulbourne-Elliott, and his parents, Edwardo and Myrtle, along with David Harris, Dwayne Sibbles, Kendale Roberts and Radcliff McLean.</p>
      <p>They are accused of defrauding the local government authority of more than $400 million.</p>
      <p>Police personnel, attorneys and court staff have indicated that the move to the outstations has been difficult because the courts are not centrally located and only have one courtroom each.</p>
      <p>For days court workers in Mandeville operated under a tent just outside of the courthouse but have since moved to James Warehouse Plaza in the town. </p>
