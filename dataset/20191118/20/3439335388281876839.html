      <p>Kofi Cockburn’s double-double helped Illinois pull away to a 66-53 basketball victory over Hawaii today in Champaign, Ill.</p>
      <p>Cockburn, a 7-foot-1, 290-pound center, amassed 15 points and 14 rebounds to boost the Illini, who remain unbeaten in eight meetings against the Rainbow Warriors.</p>
      <p>It was tied at 26 at the half as the ’Bows slowed the transition and kept the Illini away from the offensive glass. The ’Bows cut a 10-point deficit to 52-47 when Zigmars Raimo slipped his way in for a layup with 7:19 to play. But Illinois went on a 14-2 run to move out of reach.</p>
      <p>Cockburn created fits for UH’s post defense, catching lobs in the paint and scoring off spins and left-handed hooks. Guard Trent Frazier kept the ’Bows from packing their man-to-man and zone defenses with drives and outside jumpers.</p>
      <p>Raimo led the ’Bows with 16 points. UH guards Drew Buggs and Eddie Stansberry combined for 16 points on 7-for-26 shooting, including 2-for-12 from behind the arc.</p>
