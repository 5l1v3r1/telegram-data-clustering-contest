      <h1>Tesla’s Elon Musk praises Ford on new electric Mustang SUV</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:22:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Manskar</a></address>
      <p>Elon Musk is happy to see Ford gallop into his territory.</p>
      <p>The Tesla CEO congratulated the automaker on the Sunday launch of its <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/fords-next-mustang-will-be-an-electric-suv/">all-electric Mustang Mach-E</a>, a potential rival to Tesla’s own cars.</p>
      <p>“Sustainable/electric cars are the future!!” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1196295253268946945">said on Twitter</a> early Monday. “Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too.”</p>
      <p>The new Mustang SUV will arrive late next year with an extended battery range of at least 300 miles. The Mach-E will come with a starting price of $43,895, about $4,400 more than Tesla’s standard Model 3.</p>
      <p>The Mach-E marks the first expansion of Ford’s Mustang line in more than half a century. Its launch <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/04/24/rivian-500-million-investment-ford.html">follows Ford’s $500 million investment</a> in the electric automaker Rivian, with which it plans to develop a new battery-powered vehicle.</p>
      <p>Musk’s congratulatory tweet came about three days before Tesla is scheduled to show off its “Cybertruck,” an electric pickup the company will unveil Thursday in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Ford thanked Musk for his friendly note.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t agree more,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Ford/status/1196299471308476418">the company tweeted</a> to Musk. “See you at the charging station!”</p>
