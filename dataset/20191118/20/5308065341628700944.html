      <p>The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) has revealed that the four core values anchoring the party are Compassion, Transparency, Independence and Accountability.</p>
      <p>The PSP is by veteran politician Dr Tan Cheng Bock – the very first ex-People’s Action Party (PAP) parliamentarian to start his own opposition party in Singapore’s history. He was MP for Ayer Rajah Single Member SMC from 1980 to 2006.</p>
      <p>A beloved politician, Dr Tan gained the highest margin of victory for the PAP in his last election as a PAP candidate in 2001, with 88 per cent of votes. During his time with the PAP, he also mentored younger politicians like Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, and Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.</p>
      <p>In the coming election, Dr Tan will be clashing with his former party as the leader of the PSP – an opposition party that is making waves in Singapore, despite the fact that it is the newest political party in Singapore, having been founded in January this year.</p>

      <p>Last week, the party unveiled its four core values. Compassion is the first core value of the PSP and the party promised to maintain a connection with the people and remain caring towards them. The second PSP value is Transparency. Revealing that it views the people as stakeholders, the party promised to remain transparent and pursue clarity and truth.</p>
      <p>The PSP’s goal to be the Government’s check and balance and champion justice and honour is reflected in its third core value, Independence. The final core value is Accountability and the party promises to remain open, trustworthy and make responsible decisions.</p>

      <p>In April, Dr Tan unveiled the party’s symbol, which is in the form of a palm tree signifying growth, purpose, strength and life. He revealed:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“The tree has 5 fronds and the trunk is in the shape of a person. The person-shaped trunk represents the Party’s belief that people are its core interest and source of strength.<br/></b>
        <br/>
        <b>“The 5 fronds represent the 5 ideals which the Party subscribes to: Democracy, Equality, Justice, Peace &amp; Progress. They also represent our multi-racial and inclusive society consisting of the 4 racial groups and new citizens.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Dr Tan further announced that PSP’s party colours are red and white. He explained that the colour red symbolises “life, passion, energy and strength” while the colour white symbolises “purity, integrity and goodness.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Dr Tan had said that he feels he has a short time left to effect much needed change in Singapore and that he wants to see <i><b>“a compassionate and truly democratic Singapore where good values and people matter.”</b></i></p>
      <p>Adding that <i><b>“freedom of choice and free speech without fear must be defended,”</b></i> he said, <i><b>“in due course, as the party and candidates mature, we intend to be ready to govern the nation. In the mean time, we will work with those who share our political beliefs of country first – before either party or self.”</b></i></p>
      <p>In October, the PSP hinted that it can be expected to focus on hot button issues like the cost of living, education and the affordability of healthcare and retirement during the upcoming general election.</p>
      <p>The party has taken unique and innovative approaches to understand the real concerns of Singaporeans, by reaching out to people on public trains and buses and by organising two islandwide walkabouts so far, where members canvassed all 29 wards in Singapore at the same time.</p>
