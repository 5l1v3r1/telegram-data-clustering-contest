      <h1>NASA detects water vapor on Jupiter’s moon Europa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:04:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author">James Rogers</a></address>
      <p>An international research team led by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/nasa">NASA’s</a> Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland has, for the first time, detected water vapor above the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa.</p>
      <p>Using the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, scientists were able to measure the water vapor.</p>
      <p>“Confirming that water vapor is present above Europa helps scientists better understand the inner workings of the moon,” said NASA, in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa">statement</a> released Monday. “For example, it helps support an idea, of which scientists are confident, that there’s a liquid water ocean, possibly twice as big as Earth’s, sloshing beneath this moon’s miles-thick ice shell.”</p>

      <p>Scientists detected enough water releasing from Europa to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool in seconds. However, the water appears infrequently, at least in terms of amounts visible from Earth. The findings are reported in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0933-6">Nature Astronomy</a>.</p>

      <p>“Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system. But the third — liquid water — is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,” said Lucas Paganini, a NASA planetary scientist who led the water detection investigation. “While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we’ve found the next best thing: water in vapor form.”</p>
      <p>In 2013 Hydrogen and Oxygen were detected in plumes on Europa by scientists using the Hubble space telescope.</p>
