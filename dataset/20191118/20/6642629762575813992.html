      <p>Russia on Monday handed over three navy ships it seized a year ago from Ukraine, Moscow and Kyiv authorities said, in the latest move to ease tensions between the two countries in advance of a crucial summit.</p>
      <p>After an exchange of prisoners in September and the withdrawal of some front-line forces over the last few weeks, the handover marked another step in trying to resolve the five-year conflict in eastern <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ukraine.html">Ukraine</a>.</p>

      <p>Efforts have been building since the election of Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Ukraine's new president, and on Friday France announced he would hold his first face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris on December 9.</p>
      <p>The talks, which will be mediated by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will be the highest-level negotiations on the conflict since 2016.</p>
      <p>Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday the ships - two gunboats and a tugboat - had been handed over to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>It said they had "illegally crossed the Russian border" and were held as evidence but were no longer needed.</p>
      <p>Ukraine confirmed the handover of the Nikopol, Berdyansk, and Yany Kapu vessels.</p>
      <p>Ukraine's Navy said the ships "had begun moving towards mainland Ukraine".</p>
      <h3>France welcomes </h3>
      <p>Paris hailed the move, saying the step would help bolster mutual trust before the summit.</p>
      <p>"The gesture was awaited and contributes to strengthening the trust in the dialogue between Russia and Ukraine," the French presidency said in a statement, following telephone talks between Macron and Putin.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian vessels were seized in November last year in the most serious confrontation between the two countries since the start of the conflict in 2014.</p>
      <p>Russian forces took control of the ships as they headed through the Kerch Strait, a narrow waterway giving access to the Sea of Azov that is used by Ukraine and Russia.</p>
      <p>They captured 24 Ukrainian sailors, who were returned to Ukraine as part of the September prisoner swap.</p>
      <p>Television on Sunday showed footage of the ships being towed by the Russian coastguard through the Kerch Strait.</p>
      <p>Ukrainian officials did not specify when the vessels were scheduled to arrive in Ukraine, but analysts predicted it might happen early on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The election of Zelenskyy, a television comedian who shocked the country's elites by winning the presidency in April, has raised hopes the conflict can finally be resolved.</p>
      <p>Zelenskyy has said ending the war - which has left more than 13,000 dead - is his top priority.</p>
      <p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed on Monday the talks would go ahead on December 9 but appeared to downplay hopes of a major breakthrough, saying "we should not set expectations too high".</p>
      <h3>First talks in years</h3>
      <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he expected the summit to confirm "the inviolability and lack of alternative" to earlier peace accords.</p>
      <p>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas is expected to arrive in Kyiv on Tuesday to help prepare the summit.</p>
      <p>In Berlin, a foreign ministry spokesman said for the first time in a long time there has been "some movement" in the conflict.</p>
      <p>"We want to seize this momentum," he said.</p>
      <p>The four-way summit was initially announced by Macron for September, after talks with Putin in France, but was held up until the troop withdrawals took place.</p>
      <p>The structure for the talks is known as the "Normandy format" after a first meeting brought together the four heads of state in France's Normandy region in 2014.</p>
      <p>The last such meeting took place in Berlin in 2016.</p>
      <p>It aims to implement the "Minsk agreements", deals reached in 2014 and 2015 to end the conflict but which have yet to be properly put in place.</p>
      <p>The conflict in Ukraine's industrial east broke out after Russia's 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/crimea.html">Crimea</a>, which led the West to impose wide-ranging sanctions on Moscow.</p>
      <p>The separatists have declared unrecognised breakaway statelets in the mainly Russian-speaking Ukrainian eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
      <p>Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Moscow of giving financial and military backing to separatists, which <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a> denies.</p>
      <p>September's exchange was the first major step in years to reduce tensions, with the two countries swapping 70 prisoners. </p>
      <p>It was followed over the past few weeks by the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops and separatist forces from several flashpoint areas along the front line.</p>
