      <h1>I Want SPORE and SIMGOLF to Be Remade</h1>

      <p>Guys, the other day, <b><i>Spore</i></b> was on sale on Steam and it took me back. I grabbed it and I’ve been enjoying reliving 2008. This got me thinking about some things though and some older games that I would love to be redone for today’s audience. Sadly, I could only think of two more casual titles in the vein of creating things, since Planet Coaster seems to have made a remake of RollerCoaster Tycoon moot. Interesting enough, the two games I did think of were EA titles. What creative titles would you want to be revived?</p>

      <p>I figured I’d get this one out of the way.<i> Spore</i> is a really fun game and the community is still crazy active. The problem is that the graphics just feel so yesteryear. I think that someone could take <i>Spore</i> and take it to new heights not only with improved graphics, but with improved gameplay as well. I know a lot of people felt like the late game of Spore was lackluster, so why not give it another go. I would absolutely love to play a new Spore game.</p>
      <h3>SimGolf</h3>

      <p>This is the number one PC game that I want a remake of. I have spent so much time playing this game and it’s one of the few games my dad plays as well. You get to create a golf course which is always fun, but then you get to play the course you build. It’s a lot of fun, but once again, the graphics are extremely outdated and some of the mechanics are as well. Eventually, you can add land, but because of the design being very square, it can feel really awkward expanding your course to the new plot of land.</p>
