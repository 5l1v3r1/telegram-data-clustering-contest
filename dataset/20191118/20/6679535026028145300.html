      <h2>Posting of teacher who knows Russian language caught in legal tangle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:17:06+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/A-S-Jayanth-5596/" target="_blank">A.S. Jayanth</a></address>
      <p>There is a Department of Russian and Comparative Literature at Calicut University, but none of the teachers there knows Russian language. There are no permanent faculty members to teach the language either even as there is a core paper in Russian for first semester MA students, whose exams are scheduled for December.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the university’s attempt to appoint a permanent faculty has been caught in a legal tangle as the first rank holder in the interview has approached the Kerala High Court, accusing the authorities of trying to supersede him. The students recently approached the Vice Chancellor, requesting him to address their concerns.</p>
      <p>The last permanent faculty member who knew Russian was Nagendra Shreeniwas, head of the department till October 2017. He is right now with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). The department of Russian was established in 1976, and studying the language had its benefits in the form of jobs in then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), among other things. However, the demand for courses in Russian waned since the 90s after the fall of the USSR. The department was renamed to add comparative literature in 2000 when K.K.N. Kurup was the Vice Chancellor. It now offers diploma and certificate courses in Russian, apart from the postgraduate course.</p>
      <h3>Notification</h3>
      <p>Though the university issued a notification for teachers from other departments on deputation for the post of assistant professor after Mr. Shreeniwas’ departure, there were no applicants. Sarath Mannur, who has been working in another section of the university, taught there temporarily during the period. He is an author and has a doctorate in Russian.</p>
      <p>The notification was reissued in end-April 2018, saying anyone with University Grants Commission (UGC)-mandated qualification could apply. There were two applicants, and Mr. Sarath Mannur got the first rank in the interview held in June this year. The university, however, chose to appoint the second rank holder, saying Mr. Sarath Mannur had not submitted a no-objection certificate from the section in the university where he is currently employed.</p>
      <p>He approached the Kerala High Court, which asked the university not to appoint a full-time assistant professor until a final judgement was delivered. Right now, there are four assistant professors, none of whom is appointed on a permanent basis. Meanwhile, the university senate, at its meeting on November 16, decided to change three of the posts to assistant professor (comparative literature) and retain only one post for Russian language. The UGC will have to ratify it now.</p>
