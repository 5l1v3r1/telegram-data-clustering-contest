      <h1>UK weather: Met Office issues 'danger to life' warning for freezing fog</h1>
      <h2>Met Office has issued a new yellow weather warning for large parts of the UK- but Bristol escapes the dangerous weather</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:07:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Freezing fog will blanket Britain tomorrow sparking transport chaos on the roads, forecasters warn.</p>
      <p>An urgent yellow <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather </a>warning for freezing fog from 4am to 11am has been issued for Tuesday (November 19).</p>
      <p>Although the alert doesn't cover Bristol, it comes very close, with Gloucestershire and Bath included in the warning.</p>
      <p>It's feared the dense fog, which will spread across most the country including London, Bath and Birmingham, will cause mayhem - especially at rush hour, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-uk-weather-forecast-met-20908180">Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>"Some dense fog and freezing fog patches on Tuesday morning likely leading to some travel disruption," the Met Office spokesman said.</p>
      <p>People are being told to expect "slower journey times with delays to bus and train services possible."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile "there is a chance of delays or cancellations to flights."</p>
      <p>Visibility is expected to be just 100m in places on Tuesday morning.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The worst-affected areas include most of the Midlands, Home Counties and southeast of England.</p>
      <p>Temperatures in these regions will struggle to exceed 5C tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The Met Office warns: "Travelling in fog can be extremely dangerous. Fog can drift rapidly and is often patchy."</p>
      <h3>Advice for road users when travelling in fog</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid travel if possible</li>
        <li>Drive very slowly with dipped headlights, full-beam lights reflect off the fog causing a 'white wall' effect</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on your speed, fog can give the illusion of moving in slow motion</li>
        <li>Use fog lights, but remember to turn them off when the visibility improves</li>
        <li>Don't hang on the tail lights of the car in front, rear lights can give a false sense of security</li>
        <li>Watch out for freezing fog which is made of water droplets that freeze on contact with objects such as the pavement, road, car, etc. It can quickly form a layer of ice.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It comes after wintry showers swept across the UK this morning. Icy surfaces could remain a hazard tomorrow, forecasters say.</p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “Temperatures could dip to -8C (17.6F) or -9C (15.8F)... on Monday night.</p>
      <p>“This would be the coldest night of autumn with the lowest temperature we have seen so far being -8.1C (17.42F).”</p>
      <p>A netweather.tv spokesman added: "After a day with highs of 4-9c (coldest in the north), temperatures will quickly fall during the evening bringing a widespread frost and a few fog patches overnight."</p>

      <p>The Environment Agency has 51 flood warnings and 90 less serious flood alerts in force for England.</p>
      <p>It will begin cold in Bristol tomorrow although temperatures will rise slightly in the afternoon with the mercury peaking at 9C.</p>
      <p>But thanks to a nasty wind chill, it will feel a few degrees cooler than this.</p>

      <p>And 42 flood warnings remain in place today, many of which relate to rivers in the Midlands and Yorkshire.</p>
      <h3>Met Office forecast:</h3>
      <h4>This evening and tonight:</h4>
      <p>Clear skies for much of England, Wales and Scotland leading to a very cold night with widespread frost. Fog also forming, particularly across parts of the Midlands and into south and southeast England. Cloudier and windier over Northern Ireland.</p>
      <h4>Tuesday:</h4>
      <p>Fog gradually lifting during the morning with bright or sunny spells developing. Rain arriving over Northern Ireland may affect the far west of mainland UK later. Still cold for most.</p>
      <h4>Outlook for Wednesday to Friday:</h4>
      <p>Turning increasingly unsettled from the southwest with showers or longer spells of rain, heaviest in southwest England and south Wales. Windy at times but temperatures recovering to nearer normal.</p>
