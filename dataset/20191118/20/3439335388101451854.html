    <meta property="og:description" content="Question: What is a motorist to do when they find a good parking stall close to their destination only to find the meter not working? For the second time this week I have found a great spot on Makaloa Street beside the First Hawaiian Bank only to find the meter broken. My feeling is that, based on the fact that the rates skyrocketed this year and there is a lack of spots, that the tax-paying citizen should still be able to park there. It is not our fault that the meter is deficient. I donâ€™t believe the citizen should get a ticket for parking in a spot where they are unable to insert coins due to broken meter."/>
