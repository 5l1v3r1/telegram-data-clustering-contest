      <p>Kate Garraway has got off to a tricky start in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> 2019 after being chosen <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-2019-kate-garraway-another-nightmare-bushtucker-trial-caitlyn-jenner-11174977/">along with Caitlyn Jenner for the first Bushtucker trial of the series.</a></p>

      <p>Kate is married to former lobbyist and political advisor Derek Draper, whom she wed in 2005.</p>
      <p>Derek is her second husband, with the presenter previously being married to her former ITV Meridian boss Ian Rumsey from 1998-2002.</p>
      <p>Kate and Derek have two children, daughter Darcey who was born in 2006, and son Bill, who was born in 2009.</p>
      <p>She recently revealed that it was her children who spurred her on to take part in I’m A Celebrity, <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2019111780641/kate-garraway-reveals-why-she-taking-part-im-a-celebrity-2019-exclusive/">telling Hello!</a>: ‘It’s all their fault. Darcey really got into the last couple of series and kept saying: “You should so do this Mum,” and things like “You should eat that slug from the garden, or jump off of that wall to practise.”. It’s been a war of attrition.’</p>
