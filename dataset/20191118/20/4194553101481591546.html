      <h1>Ludicrous report claims Real Madrid will offer one of four players including Isco in part-exchange for Van Dijk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:21:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Spanish outlet <a href="https://www.diariogol.com/real-madrid/florentino-perez-lo-hace-intocable-de-juergen-klopp-120-millones-y-al-real-madrid_20010770_102.html">Diario Gol</a> claim that Real Madrid are prepared to offer one of Gareth Bale, Luka Modric, Isco or Marco Asensio as part of a deal to sign Virgil van Dijk.</p>
      <p>The report states that the Dutchman is seen as being a long-term replacement for Sergio Ramos, though that would be a slightly bizarre move considering he is already 28.</p>
      <p>Neither Bale nor Modric would be of any interest to the Reds, and while both of the other two players named are excellent and could be tempting to sign outright, there is no way the Reds would entertain sacrificing Van Dijk to get them.</p>
      <p>With the international break in full swing, it’s almost like the report has been put out to fill some space…</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that Real Madrid would want to acquire Van Dijk – he is the best defender in the world – but there is no chance of the Reds being willing to let him leave. There is also no reason to think he might want to move.</p>
