      <p>A mother was able to rescue her missing daughter after seeing her appear in a TV report about snowy weather.</p>
      <p>Jill Rosenow has been searching for her daughter Alice Crawford since she vanished from her home in North Dakota over the summer.</p>
      <p>And she was stunned to discover that Alice had appeared on a TV news station in Denver, Colorado, late last month.</p>
      <p>Alice, who was living on the streets of the Mile High City, told a crew that its freezing, snowy conditions were ‘death weather’ and that she feared for her safety.</p>
      <p>Despite not having access to the TV station which broadcast the interview, Jill learned about the clip, and immediately jetted out to Denver.</p>

      <p>‘It broke my heart. I cried. Seeing my daughter on the streets, homeless … a mother is only as happy as her saddest child.</p>
      <p>‘As you can imagine, I’m a train wreck. I cry. I think about her.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t sleep at night. I just want her back. She needs to be safe.</p>
      <p>‘She needs to be off the streets… It’s a mother’s worst nightmare.’</p>

      <p>Jill and other relatives arrived in Denver from as far afield as California and Seattle, before chatting to the reporter who’d spoken to Alice in a bid to track her down.</p>
      <p>They spent two days chatting to hundreds of people, and showing Alice’s photo to everyone who would listen.</p>
      <p>Jill and her relatives were beginning to give up hope of finding Alice when they visited the city’s Union Station.</p>
      <p>But they were reunited unexpectedly when Alice’s aunt Theresa Brown went to use the restroom, and heard Alice’s voice coming from a locked stall.</p>
      <p>Theresa recalled: ‘It was really by accident, well, I had to use the restroom.</p>
      <p>‘We walked into the restroom thinking it was empty and the last stall was occupied.</p>
      <p>‘As I was getting ready to go into my stall, we heard her voice.’</p>

      <p>Jill was thrilled to see her daughter, who has battled drug addiction, and was covered in scabs after months on the street.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘It was just over. Just like that. In a wonderful way it was over. The search was over.’</p>
      <p>Alice has spent the last three days throwing up, but Jill is hopeful about her daughter’s future, and said: ‘She’s alive, and that counts for more than anything.’</p>
      <p>Jill plans to get Alice into rehab as soon as her daughter is well enough to fly.</p>
      <p>She and her family plan to take Alice out of their home state, so she can focus on sobriety without unhelpful distractions.</p>
