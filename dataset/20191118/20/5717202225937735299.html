        <b>A number of Birmingham City fans have taken to Twitter to comment on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sunday-people">reports from the Sunday People (17/11; page 50) suggesting</a> that Leeds United want David Stockdale in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stockdale has endured a difficult time since moving to St Andrew’s. He played 39 times in all competitions during his first year with the club. But he has not made a league appearance for Birmingham since May 2018.</p>

      <p>Pep Clotet has used him once this season. And it appears that there may be a good chance that the 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat to Portsmouth in August could prove to be his final appearance for the club.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sunday-people">The Sunday People (17/11; page 50) reports</a> that Leeds want Stockdale in January. Kiko Casilla has been outstanding for Marcelo Bielsa’s side this term. But the Whites are certainly lacking an experienced backup option.</p>

      <p>A move for Stockdale looks to make good sense for Leeds. He may not play much, but there are few around who boast more experience in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, plenty of Birmingham fans appear to be in favour of Stockdale moving to Leeds. They believe that he needs to be offloaded in the near future, and hope that the Whites do make a move.</p>
      <p>It is perhaps telling that, despite wanting Lee Camp to be dropped as number one, several Blues supporters would still not mind seeing Stockdale move to Elland Road.</p>
      <p>If Leeds are determined to land a more experienced backup option, it would appear that a move for Stockdale could prove to be best for all parties.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the Birmingham fans make of the reports…</p>
