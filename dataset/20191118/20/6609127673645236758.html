        <b>PATIENTS were given extra blankets to keep warm after the heating broke down at Scotland’s scandal-hit superhospital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bosses ordered in mobile heaters as engineers battled for hours to fix the system at the £842million site.</p>

      <p>Staff on every ward at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow battled to keep the winter chill at bay in bone-chilling conditions on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The latest problem to hit the NHS hub, which opened just four years ago, comes as prosecutors confirmed they are investigating the death of a boy aged three at the Royal Hospital for Children, also on the campus.</p>
      <p>One patient in an A&amp;E unit when the system broke said: “I couldn’t believe it when I heard staff talk about wards without heating.</p>
      <p>“I heard a doctor say it was affecting patients in the high dependency unit and they had to use space heating to stabilise the problem.</p>
      <p>“The thought of this happening at a multi-million pound facility defies belief. It’s an outrage.”</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “There were some issues with the heating system on Saturday.</p>

      <p>“These were rectified by our senior Estates staff, who successfully carried out urgent repairs.</p>
      <p>“Temporary mobile heaters and additional blankets were quickly made available to ensure patients were comfortable. We would like to apologise to any patients affected by this.”</p>
      <p>In a blast at Health Secretary Jeane Freeman, Scots Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said: “The number of scandals totting up on her watch has become unsustainable. She is no longer fit to be health secretary.</p>
      <p>Labour’s Monica Lennon added: “SNP ministers have allowed issues to build up and the maintenance and repairs backlog across the NHS is close to £1billion. Patients deserve better.”</p>
      <p>We told how the Crown Office is probing the child’s death in August 2017.</p>
      <p>He lost his life three weeks before <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4959465/mum-daughter-killed-glasgow-hospital-dirty-water-health-truth/">cancer patient Milly Main</a>, 10, died from an infection.</p>
      <p>We told how her mum Kimberly Darroch believes it was <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4962089/glasgow-hospital-milly-main-cover-up-mum-bullying-whistleblower/">linked to dirty water</a> and demanded the truth over the tragedy.</p>
      <p>The health board insists the source of the bug cannot be determined.</p>
      <p>A damning report ordered earlier this year after the deaths of two patients at the campus exposed a backlog of 300 repair jobs.</p>
