      <p>Stocks took a breather on Monday as investors digest potentially negative trade-war news. However, we’re far from a panic at this point. Let’s look at a few top stock trades to kick off the week.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)</h3>

      <p>We had to zoom out 14 months to capture some of the collapse in <b>Nvidia</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/nvda-stock-quote/"><b><u>NVDA</u></b></a>) stock from 2018’s fourth quarter. Slowly but surely the chip giant has been climbing out of a tough hole.</p>
      <p>After falling slightly on Friday after <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nvidia-earnings-bump-nvda-stock/">reporting earnings</a>, it looked like NVDA might pullback to the 50-day moving average. However, Monday’s rebound has longs thinking of buying a breakout rather than buying the dip.</p>
      <p>If shares can push over short-term resistance (around $212.50) then a move to $220-plus could be in store. It would put the 38.2% retracement level near $227.50 on the table, which would fill the gap from last year’s breakdown.</p>
      <p>If $212.50 holds as resistance, see that the 20-day moving average buoys the name.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The <b>S&amp;P 500</b>, <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b> and <b>Nasdaq Composite</b> have all gone on to hit new all-time highs. However, the <b>Russell 2000</b> has yet to do so and in fact, remains notably below its former highs.</p>
      <p>Investors can see that the <b>iShares Russell 2000 ETF</b> (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/iwm-stock-quote/"><b><u>IWM</u></b></a>) still remains relatively range-bound between $145 and $159. Remember, we <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/10/5-top-stock-trades-for-thursday-googl-xom-gm/">flagged the test of range support</a> in October, which gave bulls a dip-buying opportunity.</p>
      <p>Now, they need to see the recent consolidation in the IWM (blue lines) resolve higher. If small-cap stocks start to play ball, stock market bulls can really gain momentum.</p>
      <p>For that to happen we’ll need to see a move over $160.50 in the IWM. That could get a move up toward $167.50 going. If resistance holds steady or the IWM resolves lower, see if its major moving averages can support the name between $153 and $154.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Xerox (XRX)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/xrx.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>HP </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hpq-stock-quote/"><b><u>HPQ</u></b></a>) turned down the offer from <b>Xerox</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/xrx-stock-quote/"><b><u>XRX</u></b></a>) to be acquired, <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/stock-market-today-t-mobile-legere-to-lead-wework/">although this story is far from over</a>.</p>
      <p>Both stocks continue to trade okay, particularly XRX near its highs. The key now is to see the stock hold up above $36. This is the prior high from July, but more importantly, was the “take-off” level earlier this month once all this M&amp;A news got underway.</p>
      <p>Below $36 and $34 could be on the table, and possibly lower. Unless some big news sends it over, trend-line resistance (blue line) should keep a lid on XRX. Keep in mind, with much of this news being M&amp;A related, the charts are prone to big gaps, both up and down.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Roku (ROKU)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/roku-2.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Roku</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/roku-stock-quote/"><b><u>ROKU</u></b></a>) has been unstoppable. Anyone who <a href="https://twitter.com/BretKenwell/status/1192827728438976524">bought on the initial post-earnings dip</a> has seen a rally of $40 or more in just a few days. Shares are now north of $160, a level that it has had trouble sustaining in the past.</p>
      <p>From here, it can go one of two ways. Either shares continue to push higher and hurdle $170, or $160 fails and puts $150 back on the table as possible support. Keep in mind that, technically speaking, Roku stock isn’t overbought yet.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t mean it will keep rallying, just that it can keep going higher if bulls push it. Investors have to start thinking about how many stops are parked above $170 and what could happen in the event of a short squeeze. Again, that’s not a guarantee, but it’s something to think about.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Intelsat (I)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/i.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>When I pulled up the chart for <b>Intelsat</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/i-stock-quote/"><b><u>I</u></b></a>) on Monday, shares were down big, at $10. Just a few hours later and the stock is down even more, now near $8.</p>
      <p>At the time, the only support level I could find was at $7.50, still notably far from $10. Near that level now and I don’t know that I have the confidence to call this one a buy.</p>
      <p>Given the volatility, it would be best to either watch this one from the sidelines or give it a few days to settle down. Below $7.50 and $6 or lower could be here in a hurry. If $7 support holds, a rebound to the 200-week could be in store, up near $11. Use caution.</p>
