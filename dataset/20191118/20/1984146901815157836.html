      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Knight</a></address>
      <p>Sean Longstaff is reportedly not a 'key target' for Manchester United in the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Yoshinori Muto is believed to be mulling over his future on Tyneside, while Phillipe Albert has opened up on his United career.</p>
      <p>Here are your top <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> stories for Monday, November 18:</p>
      <h3>Longstaff not a 'key target'</h3>
      <p>Newcastle United midfielder Sean Longstaff is not a 'key target' for Manchester United, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was on  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">the Reds'</a>  radar last summer as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looked at signing a replacement for Ander Herrera, who joined PSG on a free transfer.</p>

      <p>Manchester United tend to identify three targets per position after whittling down a long list of hundreds and hundreds of players assembled on the club's database.</p>
      <p>Longstaff fits the Reds' current transfer policy as a young British player who is humble off the field but ESPN claim that Solskjaer has identified Erling Haaland, Jadon Sancho, James Maddison, Callum Wilson, Declan Rice, John McGinn, Jack Grealish and Moussa Dembele as priority targets.</p>
      <h3>Muto on the move?</h3>
      <p>Yoshinori Muto’s Newcastle future is uncertain with fresh claims that he is looking for a move away to get first team football.</p>
      <p>The Magpies will look to move on some fringe players in the January transfer window, with Newcastle looking to shift both Jack Colback and Henri Saivet <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-aarons-lazaar-colback-16821404">after they ran out of time to move them on in the summer</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The pair are both kicking their heels in first team exile after being excluded from the first team squad but have a combined weekly wage of around £100,000 so it makes financial sense to move them on. The confusion around the managerial situation didn’t help Newcastle in the summer, with Steve Bruce undecided about Colback until late in the window.</p>
      <p>But there are others who may be allowed to leave, with Muto’s future up in the air.</p>
      <h3>Possession problems</h3>
      <p>Newcastle United have been ranked as the second least dominant side in European football this season when it comes to passing.</p>
      <p>According to research carried out by CIES, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United</a> are struggling to dominate games when it comes to passes in the opposition third, while at the same time are being overrun by the opposing sides in their own third.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article17013079.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1177875053.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The stats were compiled for passes achieved in opponent third vs passes conceded in own third, and United came in the second bottom when it comes to a ratio made up of both averages.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">The Magpies</a> on average made 71 passes in the opponent’s third, versus 175 by the opponents in their own third - a ratio of 0.41.</p>
      <h3>Albert on United career</h3>
      <p>Philippe Albert wrote his name into Tyneside folklore with that delightful chip over Peter Schmeichel to round off a never-to-be-forgotten 5-0 Newcastle United victory over Man United.</p>
      <p>Even 23 years later that game - and that goal - are still talked about by Newcastle fans like it was yesterday.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Albert had already won the hearts of United fans due his tendency - despite being a defender - to throw caution to the wind and attack as a key part of The Entertainers side built by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Kevin Keegan</a> .</p>
      <p>Now 52, Albert is back living in Charleroi and has opened up on his time at Newcastle in an interview with The Guardian.</p>
      <h3>Scouting mission</h3>
      <p>"I would hope it's business. He can't be on the Copacabana surely!" <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> was giving little away when asked about Steve Nickson travelling to South America on a scouting mission earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The fact that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United's</a> head of recruitment had flown to the other side of the world to watch players and meet agents should not come as a surprise.</p>
      <p>Tony Faulkner, who worked with Nickson for nine years at Blackburn, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-transfer-steve-nickson-16621833">previously told ChronicleLive</a> his friend knew 'the name of the Mum and Dad and sisters and brothers' of a '12-year-old living in Colombia'.</p>

      <p>These days, given the technology on offer, that level of knowledge is expected of transfer chiefs in the Premier League but the mention of Colombia is far from a coincidence.</p>
      <p>Newcastle twice broke their transfer record to sign two South Americans, Miguel Almiron and Joelinton, in 2019 and expect more to follow in the coming years.</p>
