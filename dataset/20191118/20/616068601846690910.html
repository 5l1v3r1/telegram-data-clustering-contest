        <b>ORIGINAL: 11:30 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Kelowna teen reported missing last week may be on the run in the Armstrong area with up to two other young people.</p>
      <p>RCMP have yet to update the case of 14-year-old Trinity Erickson, who <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/270571/search-for-14-year-old-girl">was last seen Friday</a> morning.</p>
      <p>Her aunt, Mikayla Erickson, posted on Facebook over the weekend that Trinity had been spotted with a teenage boy near Eagle Rock Road, running away from police through a field.</p>
      <p>"If you see Trinity, please call the police and yell at the top of your lungs how much she is loved. She must be hurting right now and needs to know that so many people care about her and she is so beautiful," said her aunt.</p>
      <p>A second Facebook page, Help Find Trinity, identified the boy as 15-year-old Michael Campbell.</p>
      <p>A third teen may also be with them.</p>
      <p>It's not known if the group is attempting to leave the Okanagan.</p>
      <p>Bonnie Campbell, Michael's aunt, wrote that she had heard they were staying in a run-down trailer in the area. That has not been confirmed by authorities.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is urged to contact their local police, or CrimeStoppers at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).</p>
      <p>"If you find her, call me at 250-870-6809, call the police, and then yell at the top of your lungs that she is so loved," said Trinity's aunt.</p>
