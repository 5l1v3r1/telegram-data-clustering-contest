          <p>Waning, regressing, wavering and unravelling, this San Antonio Spurs side has been unable to wrench out of their impasse. After registering wins in each of their opening five fixtures, the side have failed to win even a lone clash out of their next eight matches to go from challenging for a spot in the annuls of the Western Conference to currently occupy 13th place, a position which perfectly epitomises their predicament at the moment.</p>
          <p>Whilst the side have not been comprehensively dismantled and decimated, they have failed to show the composure in defence to ship points at crucial junctures with their backline failing to rise to the occasion. The previous 121-116 defeat to Portland Trail Blazers was a testament to this rhetoric with the side losing points in the dying stages to leave them flummoxed and floundering to yet another defeat.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere, Dallas Mavericks make an advent into today’s forthcoming tie having managed to slump out of their ordeal the last time around as they brought an end to two defeats in succession. The 110-102 win over the Raptors was important owing not only due to the peril it curtailed for them but the identity of the side they defeated as well, a result which showed the true calibre of this side which is worthy of continuing in their ascendancy in the conference.</p>

                            <h3>DAL vs SAS Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>A major reason for Dallas Mavericks’ consummate success has been their point guard Luka Doncic with the player running the show for the side with his tenacity and imperious performances seeing him being involved in everything right that has transpired for the contingent. </p>
                            <p>It has seen the player emerge with a stellar 28.5 points and the 10.1 assists to go with them but what has really stood tall is the 10.7 rebounds he’s gotten on the end of to become a quintessential player in defence as well for the side. The player was always someone we knew we had to engage in, seeing us make the point guard our first pick for today’s imminent clash.</p>
                            <h3>DAL vs SAS Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>This docket of our Dream 11 side sees us opt for Delon Wright from Dallas Mavericks not only due to his enterprising and enigmatic nature as a player but the paper thin identity of the opposition’s defence as well. He is up against a team who have completely faltered to screen players and pull off blocks, a discourse which will see Wright line himself up outside the circle and send down triples with relative ease.</p>
                            <h3>DAL vs SAS Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>The one player apiece are selected by us from either side with is making Justin Jackson our cheap pick for this encounter. The player won’t be in the playing 5 for his unit but the role he will be accorded over by his outfit as a substitute makes him an ideal choice given the euphoria filled displays he’s pulled off in his limited time out on the court.</p>
                            <p>We finally make our first player come in from San Antonio Spurs as well in the form of Marco Belinelli. If the side are to have any chance of winning today, they’ll be needing the payer to use the versatility he’s amassed fruitfully and try to pull off treys for his side today.</p>
                            <h3>DAL vs SAS Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>Maximiliano Kleber from Dallas Mavericks is our pick for this one given the points the player has persistently registered in the paint for his side. He’s positioned himself perfectly to always emerge as a viable option to send down layups, someone whose floating jump points and scrimmages on the court have made him an indispensible option for his side.</p>
                            <p>From the other side meanwhile we are picking up Trey Lyles courtesy of the 8 rebounds per match he’s registered. The player will be asked to persistently position himself underneath his side’s pole and pull off blocks and steals to see us go in with him for this one.</p>
                            <h3>DAL vs SAS Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>LaMarcus Aldridge will be asked to intertwine his attributes alongside Lyles in this clash, a player who has justified the role he’s been handed over in defence with some extradonaire deflections and rebounds. From the other side meanwhile we are moving in with Kristaps Porzingis, someone who ability to transition the ball and turn it over from defence to attack makes him a sublime value for the forthcoming affair.</p>
                            <h3>Star Player</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to move in with Doncic as our side’s star player for this outing.</p>
