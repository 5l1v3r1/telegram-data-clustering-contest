      <p>Donald Trump has suggested that he would be open to testifying publicly or in writing as part of an impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>After the speaker of the lower house, Nancy Pelosi, upped the ante by suggesting that Mr Trump come forward to tell the “truth,” the Republican president said he was keen.</p>
      <p>Ms Pelosi told<i> Face the Nation </i>on Sunday that Mr Trump “could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants.”</p>

      <p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed that suggestion.</p>
      <p>“If Donald Trump doesn’t agree with what he’s hearing, doesn’t like what he’s hearing, he shouldn’t tweet. He should come to the committee and testify under oath. And he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath,” Senator Schumer told reporters.</p>
      <p>He said the White House’s insistence on blocking witnesses from co-operating begs the question: “What is he hiding?”</p>
      <p>Mr Trump replied to the invitation on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!”</p>
      <p>It comes as US State Department officials have been informed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden even before the July phone call that has led to impeachment hearings in Washington, two people with knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press.</p>

      <p>In early May, officials at the US Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were told Zelenskiy was seeking advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, the two people told the AP.</p>
      <p>He was concerned that Mr Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 US presidential race, the two individuals said.</p>
      <p>They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.</p>
      <p>State Department officials in Kyiv and Washington were briefed on Mr Zelenskiy’s concerns at least three times, the two sources said. Notes summarising his worries were circulated within the department, they said.</p>
      <h3>MARIE YOVANOVITCH’S TESTIMONY</h3>
      <p>Three people have testified publicly so far in the House impeachment proceedings regarding whether there was a “quid pro quo” by the US to Ukraine in which aid would be released if the country announced that it was investigating Mr Trump’s potential political rival, Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Former US Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch says she became the target of a smear campaign by Mr Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and sacked by Mr Trump.</p>
      <p>A former Ukrainian prosecutor claimed that Ms Yovanovitch had blocked his team from getting visas to the United States to deliver damaging information about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter to the F.B.I.</p>

      <p>Ms Yovanovitch testified that she did indeed block the former Ukrainian prosecutor because he was corrupt.</p>
      <p>In a July 25 telephone conversation that has set off a political crisis for the president, he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ms Yovanovitch was “bad news.”</p>
      <p>“She’s going to go through some things,” the president said.</p>
      <p>Ms Yovanovitch told investigators that she felt “threatened” by Mr Trump’s remark and that she still feared retaliation.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has been criticised from Democrats and Republicans alike for tweeting during Ms Yovanovitch’s testimony that “Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad.”</p>
      <h3>BILL TAYLOR TESTIMONY</h3>
      <p>Acting Ukraine Ambassador Bill Taylor also testified publicly last week that one of his aides had overheard a conversation, on July 26, between Mr Trump and a key envoy in which the President pressed the ambassador to get Ukraine on board with “the investigations” into Mr Biden.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor testified that the aide asked the US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, what Mr Trump thought of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which (Trump personal lawyer Rudy) Giuliani was pressing for,” Mr Taylor said.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor said that he noticed there were two policy channels operating with Ukraine, a “regular” and an “irregular” one.</p>

      <p>He said the president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was guiding requests through the irregular channel.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor said it slowly became clear to him that conditions were placed on Ukraine’s new president.</p>
      <p>He had to order investigations into possible Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, and also look into Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who sat on the board of Ukrainian gas company, Burisma.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor said his staff was told the President’s interest in Ukraine was the “investigations of Biden.”</p>
      <h3>GEORGE KENT TESTIMONY</h3>
      <p>The third person to testify publicly in the impeachment inquiry is George Kent, a top State Department official.</p>
      <p>Mr Kent said he never saw any attempt to shield Burisma from scrutiny because of Mr Biden’s connection to the company.</p>
      <p>Mr Kent testified that Mr Trump wanted the Ukrainian President to “go to a microphone” and read a statement that included nothing less than the words: “investigations, Biden, and Clinton.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mr Kent testified there is “no factual basis” for allegations that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, something that has been floated by Trump allies.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s amply clear that Russian interference was at the heart of the interference,” he said.</p>
      <p>CNN reported on Monday afternoon local time that the House is now currently investigating whether or not Mr Trump lied to Robert Mueller during the Special Council investigation on corruption, which was conducted between 2017 and 2019.</p>
