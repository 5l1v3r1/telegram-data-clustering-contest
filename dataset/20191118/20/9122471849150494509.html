      <h1>ESPN’s Mel Kiper Reacts To Injury To QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:59:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this month, ESPN’s Mel Kiper slotted Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa as <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2020/insider/story/_/id/28019966/kiper-2020-nfl-draft-big-board-position-rankings-how-good-qb-class">the No. 2 overall prospect</a> on his 2020 NFL Draft Big Board. Now, after Tagovailoa’s season-ending hip injury, many are wondering what will happen to his NFL Draft stock.</p>
      <p>One day after Tagovailoa was injured against Mississippi State, Kiper appeared on<i> SportsCenter</i> Sunday morning and discussed how NFL teams will now view the Alabama signal caller. After offering up prayers and well-wishes, Kiper broke down his thoughts on the matter.</p>
      <p>He admitted that teams may drop Tagovailoa behind LSU’s Joe Burrow and Oregon’s Justin Herbert if they are sufficiently worried about his durability.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/alabama-football/espns-nfl-draft-guru-mel-kiper-jr-on-tua-tagovailoas-draft-stock-following-injury/">SDS</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“When you look at the medical situation — that has to play out. We don’t have all the answers on that to what the hip situation is moving forward in terms of the rehab, but what we do with the ankles, slight knee and lower extremity injuries over the last couple of years have obviously affected Tua and impact how teams will view him moving forward, especially when you think about Joe Burrow at LSU with the great year he’s had. He’s moved up to that No. 1 quarterback spot up near the top of the draft board. Then, Tua was right in with Justin Herbert from Oregon who’s been red hot of late with a big game last night. He’s on a roll and has weapons on that offense. He’s a big rocket armed quarterback. So, now, you look at Tua. He’s not 6-3. He doesn’t have the big-time arm strength and now the durability concern is obviously real and has been for a period of time because of the ankle injuries. So, this kind of complicates matters when you’re competing with two other quarterbacks who are highly rated — it puts you (Tua) right now third in line instead of No. 1 or No. 2 when you project forward to late April.”</blockquote>
      <p>For what it’s worth, Tagovailoa underwent successful surgery today and is expected to make a full recovery. The hope is that he could return to football activities in “<a href="https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2019/11/tua-tagovailoa-being-flown-to-houston-for-hip-surgery.html">six-to-eight</a>” months.</p>
      <p>That would line up somewhere between mid-May and mid-July, if he continues to progress as hoped.</p>
