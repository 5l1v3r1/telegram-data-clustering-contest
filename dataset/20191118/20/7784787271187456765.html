      <p>The AFL’s general manager of football operations, Steve Hocking said Australia would look to field as a strong a side as possible upon the series return.</p>
      <p>“We want to take the best of the best to the two-Test series in Ireland next year and our All Australian players will be the first players selected,” Hocking said.</p>
      <p>“The IRS Tests allows players from both codes the only opportunity to represent their countries and have traditionally been great contests that have showcased their athleticism.</p>
      <p>“We saw in 2017, two high-standard matches that drew great attendances. I look forward to the rivalry continuing when the Test series returns next year.”</p>

      <p>Australia triumphed in the last instalment, winning the 2017 series 2-0 on home soil.</p>
      <p>But the contest was not without controversy with Geelong skipper Joel Selwood <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/live-coverage-of-australia-vs-ireland-in-international-rules-series-2017-second-test-in-perth/news-story/c8b4729e70feb3d3651b40feb0c66f3c">black carded for a late hit in the second match.</a> It lit the fuse and sparked an ugly melee between both sides.</p>
      <p>There have been 20 International Rules series held between Australia and Ireland. The two nations split the first four meetings between 1984 and 1990, before it became a two-Test series in 1998. They were mainly close encounters, with Ireland winning seven of the next 13 meetings. The last two series have been one-off Tests, with Australia taking the honours in 2014 and Ireland in 2015. Overall, Ireland leads the head-to-head encounters over Australia 21-18.</p>
