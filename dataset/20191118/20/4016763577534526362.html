      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Kanye-west">Kanye West</a>’s new album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/Jesus-is-king"><i>Jesus is King</i></a>, is finally available to fans, and now it appears that a sequel is in the works in conjunction with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Dr-dre">Dr. Dre</a>. ‘Ye revealed the news on Twitter, sharing a photo of himself and Dre in the studio together:</p>

      <p>This appears to be an entirely separate project than <a href="https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-announces-a-new-album-jesus-is-born-dropping-on-christmas"><i>Jesus is Born</i>, a Sunday Service album</a> he’s planning to drop this Christmas. Dre and Kanye don’t have a history of collaboration, but ‘Ye has cited the legendary producer as one of his chief inspirations on several occasions.</p>
      <p>This marks the second major announcement from Kanye in the past few days. He recently <a href="https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-announces-his-first-opera-nebuchadnezzar-debuting-later-this-month">revealed that he’s debuting a new opera</a>, titled <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, later this month at Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. <i>Jesus is King</i> dropped less than a month ago, and the rapper has also been busy putting on Sunday Service performances and <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/kanye-west-buys-14-million-wyoming-ranch-bighorn-mountain/">purchasing new real estate in Cody, Wyoming</a>.</p>
