      <p>“Everybody wake up and say whatever they want in Ghana. There were many women on the set so why will they make this allegation of me sleeping with only Akuapem Poloo? Somebody is making this up and if you don’t take care, you will commit a sin. There is no truth in that,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Brother Sammy is currently preparing towards upcoming launch of his  ‘Aduro Biaa Nkadem’ album at the Dichemso Assemblies of God Church in Kumasi on Sunday, November 24, 2019.</p>
