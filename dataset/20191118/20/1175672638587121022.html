      <h1>Lunya styles Manhattan store like a "glitzy, upscale New York apartment"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:28:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/bridget-cogley/" target="_blank">Bridget Cogley</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles clothing brand Lunya has created its New York <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/shops/">store</a> with vintage and contemporary finds to decorate zones as if they were a dining room, bedroom and living area.</p>
      <p>Ashley Merrill, who founded the <a href="https://www.lunya.co/">women's sleepwear brand</a> in 2014, has designed the New York City shop to be like a local apartment filled with a mixture of mid-century, traditional and contemporary furniture.</p>

      <p>The home-like aesthetic follows Lunya's other outposts – including its <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/06/lunya-williamsburg-store-new-york-city/">Brooklyn location in Williamsburg</a> – but aims to draw on the eclectic style of the city's residences.</p>
      <p>"With my California vantage point, New York traditionalism seems an underlying vein that can't be ignored in New York's style," Merrill told Dezeen.</p>

      <p>"New York City is a place fluent in mixing, home to the docks where many peoples from countries near and far first landed in America," she said. "It has a longer American history than our California coast, so it felt right to mix in elements from earlier European design to pay homage to the elongated timeline."</p>
      <p>"The Nolita store was designed to pay homage to the glitzy, upscale New York apartment with notes of minimal modern mixing with opulent European styles."</p>

      <p>Located just north of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/soho-new-york/">SoHo</a>, the 2,112-square-foot (196-square-metre) space comprises a deep floor plan, with natural light provided by its front glazed facade. White walls and pale grey floors form a minimal backdrop to a mix of art and furniture styles.</p>

      <p>Colourful rugs, potted plants, gold-framed mirrors, black sconces, candles and other decorations also make the store feel like a lived-in home rather than a store.</p>

      <p>The back is arranged to resemble a bedroom with a walnut Rococo-style headboard and white linens. A changing room is also located in the rear.</p>
      <p>In the middle of the shop, the dining area features a late-20th-century French table in a wood, oval construction, black metal chairs, and a black light fixture above.</p>

      <p>A plush navy sofa is paired with a decorative glass coffee table and two Barcelona chairs in caramel by architect <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/mies-van-der-rohe/">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>, and evokes a living room. A vintage stone mantle rests against the wall and gives the illusion of a working fireplace, and was found by Merrill on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>.</p>

      <p>At the entrance of the Lunya store is a vintage cream Etcetera lounge chair by Swedish designer Jan Ekselius from <a href="https://www.chairish.com/">Chairish</a>, an <a href="https://hkliving.nl/">HKLiving</a> Sungkai woven cane room divider, and a yellow oriental rug with fringe.</p>

      <p>Interspersed throughout are black clothing racks with Lunya pieces, including washable silk garments, in addition to several art pieces such as a black-and-white painting by <a href="https://www.vickybarranguet.com/">Vicky Barranguet</a>.</p>
      <p>Most the art is sourced by <a href="https://www.saatchiart.com/">Saatchi Art</a>, including a blue piece by Stephen Crimini and a greyscale pair by <a href="http://kooseunghwui.com/">Seunghwui Koo</a>.</p>
