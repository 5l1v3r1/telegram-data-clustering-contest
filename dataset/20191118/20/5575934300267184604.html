        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/chick-fil-a">Chick-fil-A</a> said on Monday that it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11">would no longer donate</a> to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army, two groups that have been criticised by LGBTQ advocates.</li>
        <li>While some people are lauding the decision, the move has sparked a Twitter battle on both sides of the political aisle. Many on the right are slamming the chain for the move, which they see as giving in to pressure from activists.</li>

      <p>Chick-fil-A said on Monday that it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/chick-fil-a-ending-donations-criticized-by-lgbtq-activists-2019-11">would stop donating money</a> to two organisations that have been under scrutiny by LGBTQ activists.</p>
      <p>In a press release, the company said it would “deepen its giving to a smaller number of organisations working exclusively in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger.” The chain confirmed to Business Insider that it would stop donating money to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army, two organisations that have been criticised by LGBTQ advocates.</p>
      <p>“We made multiyear commitments to both organisations, and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018. Moving forward you will see that the Chick-fil-A Foundation will support the three specific initiatives of homelessness, hunger and education,” a Chick-fil-A representative said in a statement to Business Insider.</p>
      <p>Following the announcement, critics took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the decision, a move that many on the right have blamed on pressure from activists.</p>
      <p>In a tweet on Monday, former Republican Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee accused the chain of betraying loyal customers for money.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Others also accused Chick-fil-A of giving into “mob” pressure. Conservative commentator Matt Walsh called the decision “a counter productive surrender” and suggested that the chain’s defiance against past critisicms was one of the main reasons for its success.</p>

      <p>Conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey and other critics tweeted similar sentiments.</p>

      <p>And some suggested that the company should be ashamed of the decision.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Dana Loesch, a former spokesperson for the National Rifle Association, suggested that pressure was to blame for Chick-fil-A’s move.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Loesch also pointed out that the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army do work that seem in line with the causes that Chick-fil-A is looking to support, namely homelessness, hunger, and education.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite the backlash, there were people who came out in support of the move. Zach Stafford, editor-in-chief of The Advocate,<a href="https://twitter.com/ZachStafford/status/1196479059032715265">tweeted</a>, “THE GAYS HAVE WON.” However, Stafford added a disclaimer in another tweet.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Joshua Israel, senior writer for The American Independent, suggested that the move was an important, yet small, step in the right direction.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/chick-fil-a-backlash-as-expands-into-uk-2019-10">Chick-fil-A has faced backlash</a> for its donations for years. In 2012, CEO Dan Cathy said he did not support same-sex marriage. After backlash, the company stopped making donations to right-wing and religious organisations known for lobbying against LGBTQ rights through the WinShape Foundation, but continued to donate to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army.</p>
