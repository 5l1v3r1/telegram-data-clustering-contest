      <h1>Trump impeachment probe leads to $25M libel lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:36:02+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:36</time> by <a rel="author">Marisa Schultz and Kate Sheehy</a></address>
      <p>The impeachment inquiry into President Trump prompted a $25 million libel lawsuit Monday by an administration official who alleges the news website Politico smeared him with faulty reporting.</p>
      <p>Kash Patel, an official with the National Security Council, claims in Virginia court documents that he was wrongly accused of “lying, deceit and unethical conduct” by Politico and one of its reporters when they alleged that he fed Trump wrong, negative information on Ukraine, according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The filing, <a href="http://go.nypost.com/?id=93051X1547088&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2019%2F11%2F18%2Ftrump-impeachment-probe-leads-to-25m-libel-lawsuit%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fmedia%2Fwhite-house-official-sues-politico-targets-schiffs-role-in-impeachment&amp;xguid=21703f6af4c3d8ecab2566215575aa49&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=10d5466d68c4d670228b1ccd10f2e40b">which was first reported by Fox News</a>, claims that Politico made the accusation in a story headlined “Nunes protégé fed Ukraine info to Trump” by reporter Natasha Bertrand.<br/>That misinformation, the story alleges, fueled the president’s belief that Ukraine was corrupt and working against him in the 2016 US presidential election, the suit says.</p>
      <p>Trump is accused of abusing his power as commander-in-chief by withholding US aid to Ukraine while demanding the country investigate his political rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>The suit also alleged in a second story on Oct. 30, Bertrand and Politico reported that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman told lawmakers in a close-door hearing that Patel “misrepresented himself” to the president “in an effort to involve himself further in Ukraine policy.”</p>
      <p>Patel, the NSC’s senior counterterrorism director, says in court documents that at “no time” before Oct. 30 had he “ever communicated with the president on any matters involving Ukraine.”</p>
      <p>Transcripts released by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of the closed-door interview revealed Vindman did not make the accusation against Patel, according to the suit.</p>
      <p>“The transcripts demonstrate that Politico, Bertrand, Schiff, and his staffers misled the public in the First and Second Politico Pieces, and intentionally lied about the substance of Hill and Vindman’s interviews,” the suit states.</p>
      <p>The suit also targets the entire impeachment inquiry into President Trump, specifically calling out Schiff’s handling of the probe.</p>
      <p>Patel accuses Politico of acting “in concert” with Schiff to report misinformation and further Schiff’s goal of impeaching the president.</p>
      <p>“Incredibly, the Defendants relied upon Schiff — a demagogue with an axe to grind against the President, against Congressman Nunes, and against Kash,” the suit alleges.</p>
      <p>“This lawsuit is high on bombast and low on merit,” said Brad Dayspring, Politico’s vice president of communications and marketing. “It is unserious and is a public relations tactic designed to intimidate journalists and media organizations from doing their job.”</p>
