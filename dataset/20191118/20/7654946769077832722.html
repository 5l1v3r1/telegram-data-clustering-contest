      <p>The husband of a Massachusetts teacher who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/25/second-grade-teacher-found-dead-in-home/">found strangled and stabbed in the couple’s home two years ago</a> was convicted Monday of killing her.</p>
      <p>Andrew MacCormack, 31, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the September 2017 death of Vanessa MacCormack, 30, by a Suffolk Superior Court jury after it deadlocked last week, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/18/husband-found-guilty-first-degree-murder-slaying-revere-elementary-school-teacher/eoHliOBCeYGsll23Tv4bNM/story.html">the Boston Globe reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Vanessa – a second-grade teacher at Connery Elementary School in Lynn – was stabbed and slashed to her face and neck after <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/27/husband-accused-of-murdering-teacher-allegedly-took-baby-to-buy-cocaine-after/">confronting her husband about his drug use and threatening to file for divorce</a>.</p>
      <p>After the slaying, Andrew left the couple’s home with their daughter to buy cocaine. Responding cops later found the woman’s body in their Revere home, which had been scrubbed with bleach, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Andrew, who pleaded not guilty to the killing, now faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He’s set to return to court for sentencing on Dec. 2, the Globe reported.</p>
      <p>Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins asked that news outlets identify Vanessa by using her maiden name of Vanessa Masucci, according to the newspaper.</p>
      <p>The woman’s relatives – who had earlier <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/14/family-of-teacher-allegedly-killed-by-husband-dont-look-at-us/">confronted Andrew in court</a>, calling him a “scumbag” during his arraignment – said the verdict gave them necessary closure.</p>
      <p>“My daughter can rest in peace now,” Karen Masucci told reporters outside the courtroom, according to the Globe. “Justice has been served.”</p>
      <p>The verdict also gave the woman’s family “some peace of mind,” according to a statement released by relatives thanking police and prosecutors in the case.</p>
      <p>“It’s been so tough,” said Vanessa’s father, Vincent Masucci. “I’m so happy that the jury got it together and did the right thing.”</p>
      <p>Assistant District Attorney Ian Polumbaum said Andrew “destroyed three families” by killing his wife, including his own extended family and the Masucci clan.</p>
      <p>Andrew, meanwhile, admitted to investigators that he had previously battled drug addiction but insisted that he’s been clean for the past six years. He also denied that the couple had any ongoing marital issues, <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/11/18/andrew-maccormack-vanessa-maccormack-murder-trial-verdict/">WBZ-TV reported.</a></p>
