      <h1>Manny Diaz Announces Update On Miami QB Tate Martell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:06:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Miami’s 2019 season has gone through its ups and downs. The Hurricanes are 6-4 with two regular season games remaining against FIU and Duke.</p>
      <p>Things haven’t gone Manny Diaz’ way this season. The same can be said for QB/WR Tate Martell.</p>
      <p>Martell has had to bounce back and forth between quarterback and receiver during his time with the Hurricanes. But it appears his days at receiver are over, according to the tweet below.</p>

      <p>Martell didn’t have any success catching passes for Miami as he didn’t record a single reception this season. All-in-all, he has just two carries for two yards through 10 games this year.</p>
      <p>Martell now has the opportunity to focus 100 percent on quarterback, the position he was recruited to play in college.</p>
      <p>The highly touted prospect out of Bishop Gorman high school has had a whirlwind of a collegiate career thus far. His days at Ohio State were short lived, and a transfer to Miami seemed to open a few doors for Martell.</p>
      <p>But the quarterback hasn’t thrown a pass for the Hurricanes. In pre-season fall camp, rumors started to swirl regarding a position change to wide receiver. Those rumors were confirmed during Miami’s season opening loss to Florida as Martell lined up at receiver.</p>
      <p>Will a move back to quarterback help Martell resurrect his skill-set?</p>
