      <h2>One resident bought 64 litres of bottled water for the most vulnerable people in her block</h2>

      <p>Homes in a block of city centre flats, homing elderly people and young families, were left without water for most of the weekend.</p>
      <p>Residents on Deanary Road say they had their water cut off on Saturday, November 16 at 10am.</p>
      <p>According to several people affected by the outage, their supply was only restored at 9pm the following day.</p>
      <p>However, a spokesperson for the building's managing company Cabot House claims water was turned off temporarily on Saturday to allow engineers to carry out work, it was then switched back on for a four-hour period before a problem arose which caused water to be cut off again.</p>
      <p>During this period a number of homes were without water to flush their toilets, cook with or even drink.</p>
      <p>Lynn Wiltshire drove to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/asda">ASDA</a> and bought 64 litres of bottled water for the most vulnerable people in her block, including an woman in her 80s with mobility problems and families with kids aged under three.</p>

      <p>The 51-year-old then forked out Â£35 for a hotel room because she couldn't stay in her home without a working toilet any longer.</p>
      <p>"It's been awful," said Lynn.</p>
      <p>"We have tried to contact the management company but no one replied. Bristol Water has checked their end three times but they said there's nothing wrong there.</p>
      <p>"The worst thing is not being able to flush your toilet. I've also ran out of clean pots and pans.</p>
      <p>"We have a lot of vulnerable people living here and there's also young families."</p>
      <p>Cabot House sometimes contract work out to Masters to fix leaks.</p>
      <p>Michael Gale, operational manager for Masters, said no one contacted him about the issue until Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>He then quickly went to Deanary Road, where he discovered there was an issue with the building's pump system and fixed it.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Cabot House said they have now given residents an emergency out-of-hours contact number should another problem arise.</p>
      <p>The company sent emails and letters apologising for the inconvenience over the weekend.</p>
