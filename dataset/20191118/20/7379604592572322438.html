They've already been battered by a ferocious hail and thunder storm. John Barrowman caught it all on camera…from the comfort of his hotel room.</li>

And we're not talking about the Kardashian family. She's going head-to-head with Kate Garraway tonight in the first Bushtucker Trial; Buggered Off. Who's your money on?</li>

It will air from from 9pm until 10.30pm on ITV. The show, which is one of the channel's most popular productions (along with Love Island of course) always brings in millions of viewers and runs for three weeks. Fans can expect this year's jungle king or queen to be crowned around mid-December.</li>

Anthony McPartlin was back presenting with Declan Donnelly after missing last year's show through illness.  They were back to their hilarious best and presented ten new celebrities ready to conquer the Australian jungle. The celebs were split into two groups and their time in luxury soon came to an end as Ant and Dec would make the celebs aware of their fate. The first group including ex sports stars Ian wright and James Haskell, news presenter Kate Garraway, singer Myles Stephenson, and former Girls Aloud member Nadine Coyle. They were instructed to swim from their boat to the beach, where the other half of celebs EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa, radio presenters Adele Roberts and Roman Kemp, comedian Andrew Maxwell Olympic Gold medallist and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner were waiting. The first celeb to swim to shore would have the choice to pick a partner from those on the beach to take on the next challenge. Rak Su's Myles Stephenson just pipped ex-rugby star James Haskell to first place, and he chose to pair up with Roman Kemp. The next task saw the return of the infamous Plank Challenge, which involved the celebs navigating high winds and walking along a plank 334 feet above Surfers Paradise. The pair with the quickest reaction time to pressing a button at the bottom of the ladder would win a spot in the bigger and better camp. Myles and Roman reacted in an impressive combined time of 1.45 seconds and won the challenge. Who would join them in the posh camp? That was to be decided in the Pontoon of Doom challenge.  James and Adele had to canoe downstream and collect tokens and their partners Caitlyn and Nadine skydived from 10,000 feet for them to collect keys for them to do the challenge. Adele and Nadine completed the challenge in the quickest time, which meant they joined Myles and Roman in the main camp.  The remaining celebs went to the smaller camp of Snake Rock on a diet of rice and beans. Kate and Jacqueline struggled to adjust to their new living arrangements, putting underwear on their heads to stop their hair becoming infested with insects, whilst Ian managed to burn some of the rice and beans. Both Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway have been voted to do the first bushtucker trial of the series: Bugged Off. <b>You can see how they get on as the next episode of I'm A Celebrity: get Me Out Of Here! is on TONIGHT November 18th at 9pm on ITV 1, followed by I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp at 10.30pm on ITV 2.</b></li>

We'll be back blogging the show tomorrow night when the first bushtucker trial is aired with both Cait and Kate being locked in boxes with 50,000 bugs and 25 rats and expected to throw things into moving buckets. It's the stuff jungle dreams are made of. See you then!</li>
