      <p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters on Monday that he was “confident” impeachment of President Donald Trump would not lead to his removal from office.</p>
      <p>McConnell said, “It looks to me like the House is determined to impeach the president. I can’t imagine a scenario under which President Trump would be removed from office with 67 votes in the Senate. So I don’t know how long senators will want to continue the trial, but I’m pretty confident at the end impeachment will not lead to ouster.”</p>
