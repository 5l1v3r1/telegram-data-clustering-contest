      <p>The Delhi High Court on Monday allowed Instagram handle — Herdsceneand — to submit, in a sealed cover, its response to artist Subodh Gupta’s plea seeking removal of alleged defamatory content made against him on the photo-sharing app.</p>
      <p>Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw also allowed the Instagram account handle to file in a sealed cover its ‘<i>vakalatnama</i>’ (document empowering a lawyer to act for and on behalf of his client) to maintain its interim anonymity and furnish a redacted copy of its response to Mr. Gupta.</p>
      <p>The anonymous account holder will have to submit its response to Mr. Gupta’s suit within two weeks.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gupta, in his suit, has sought ₹5 crore for damage caused to him and his family due to the alleged defamatory posts.</p>
      <p>The HC had earlier directed social media giants, including Google, Facebook and Instagram, to remove anonymous posts containing sexual harassment accusations against Mr Gupta that emerged during last year’s #MeToo movement. It has listed the case for further hearing on January 22, next year.</p>
