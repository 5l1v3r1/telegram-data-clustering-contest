      <h2>Joanne Shiels, of Denton Burn, stole thousands of pounds from a Whitley Bay woman who had shown her nothing but kindness</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>A shameful cleaner "mercilessly exploited" a vulnerable 81-year-old customer by stealing thousands of pounds while working in her home.</p>
      <p>Joanne Shiels had already been helped out with high value loans by the victim and her husband, who described her as affectionate and as having "more or less adopted us as grandparents".</p>
      <p>But despite their kindness, the 43-year-old started helping herself to cheques while working at their home in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/whitley-bay">Whitley Bay </a>and wrote them out to herself to the tune of £8,000.</p>
      <p>Shiels, of Denton Court, Denton Burn, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle</a>, pleaded guilty to five charges of fraud by abuse of position.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court </a>heard the victim has heart failure, mobility issues and other ailments and lives in residential accommodation with her husband.</p>
      <p>In December last year, she received a bank statement and couldn't account for two withdrawals of £2,000, in November last year.</p>
      <p>Barry Robson, prosecuting, said: "On checking her chequebook, stubs were torn out for those dates.</p>
      <p>"When she looked further into her bank statements, she noticed the account was a much lower amount that she thought it should be."</p>
      <p>Further inquiries revealed withdrawals of £2,000 and £1,000 had been made. A further £1,000 was later discovered as also having been stolen.</p>
      <p>Mr Robson said: "The bank was contacted and, unfortunately for the complainant, in order to further progress the matter she had to attend the bank in person, which was extremely difficult because of the mobility issues she has.</p>
      <p>"She was told the cheques had been made out to Joanne Shiels, who she immediately identified as her cleaner who had come on a Tuesday for the previous six to seven months."</p>
      <p>The court heard Shiels had been recommended by those at the accommodation where the victim lived and she also cleaned for other residents.</p>
      <p>Mr Robson said: "The complainant was always present when she cleaned and remembers the defendant closed the door when cleaning around the premises, including an office door where the chequebook was kept.</p>
      <p>"The complainant knew the defendant had money troubles and she had given the defendant loans for money when requested because she was sympathetic.</p>
      <p>"Sums of £300 to £600 were given quite freely by the complainant.</p>
      <p>"She said one loan was for a course she claimed to be doing at the RVI for home help care and first aid and various other amounts were given freely to try to help the defendant.</p>
      <p>"Most notably, one for the disabled mother the defendant claimed to have living with her when, for a wet room, she gave £6,500 for it."</p>
      <p>The victim said none of the loans had been paid back, with Shiels making excuses about tax on an ISA.</p>
      <p>In a victim impact statement, the pensioner said: "I have no hope of having the money stolen from me returned.</p>
      <p>"I'm in a fortunate position where the loss will not impact severely on my lifestyle but it's affected me emotionally.</p>
      <p>"I've lost sleep and my peace of mind has gone and I'm deeply upset, particularly with the fact she was involved.</p>
      <p>"She was very affectionate towards us and more or less adopted us as grandparents.</p>
      <p>"The thought of other people being targeted gave me the strength to report it to the police."</p>
      <p>Matthew Purves, defending, said: "This is a case where, without doubt, a terrible abuse of trust has taken place and there's no shying away from that by the defendant.</p>
      <p>"There's a letter from her expressing her remorse, disappointment and shame about committing these offences and there's a feeling of shattered trust between her and the complainant's family.</p>
      <p>"She worked as a cleaner in this trusted position for approximately 18 years and never a complaint or concern was put in her direction from any clients throughout that period.</p>
      <p>"She had a relatively lengthy abusive relationship and she ended up in a large amount of debt.</p>
      <p>"She could have asked for a further loan and she very well may have given it to her."</p>
      <p>Mr Purves said Shiels was drinking to excess and was convicted of drink driving last April, her only previous offence.</p>
      <p>He added that his instructions are the £6,500 was spent on the wet room and Mr Justice Martin Spencer commented: "You can understand the court's cynicism."</p>
      <p>The court heard Shiels is now working for a shop.</p>
      <p>Mr Purves said: "It's a trusted position involving opening up and closing down and handling money.</p>
      <p>"They are well aware of her conviction for these offences."</p>
      <p>Justice Spencer adjourned sentence until January for a pre-sentence report to be compiled.</p>
      <p>He told Shiels: "This is a case which, with the guidelines for fraud offences, the court is given a starting point of three years custody and a range of 18 months to four years because of the vulnerability and circumstances of the victim, who you exploited mercilessly."</p>
      <p>The judge said a pre-sentene report would help to determine whether the sentence could be suspended.</p>
      <p>But he warned Shiels: "Therefore, without giving you any sign or encouragement or belief whatsoever that the court will avoid an immediate sentence, but recognising that's a possibility, the court should have all the information available before it makes a decision, so I'm going to adjourn for a pre-sentence report."</p>
      <p>Shiels was released on bail and will be sentenced on January 20.</p>
