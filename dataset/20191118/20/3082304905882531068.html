      </p>
      <p>Bundesliga strugglers Cologne have announced Markus Gisdol as their new head coach, while Horst Heldt has been appointed sporting director.</p>
      <p>Gisdol has signed a contract that runs until June 2021 and replaces the recently sacked Achim Beierlorzer, who returned to work on Monday with German top-flight rivals Mainz.</p>
      <p>Beierlorzer lost his final four games at the helm to leave Cologne 17th and at risk of relegation from the top tier.</p>
      <p>Gisdol will be joined by a new sporting director in Heldt, who has also penned a one-and-a-half-year deal, in the hope major changes can lead to an upturn in fortunes.</p>

      <p>Former Hoffenheim and Hamburg boss Gisdol told the club’s official website: “Cologne is a top club in German football.</p>
      <p>“The current situation is not easy, but I know these challenges and I am totally convinced that we can overcome these. I want to help the team as quickly as possible, to come back to their undoubted potential.”</p>
      <p>Cologne return to action after the international break with a trip to second-place RB Leipzig at the weekend.</p>
