      <p>It used to be that Black Friday deals were only available on Friday, but now it's turned into a month-long event that seems to get bigger and bigger each year. While some of the best deals may only be available on Black Friday, and doorbuster offerings may start as early as the evening of Thanksgiving Day, that doesn't mean that you can't already score some pretty wild deals right this very minute.</p>

      <p>Retailers are trying to maximize exposure during this time of the year, which means that select items are going on sale ahead of the big day. You may be wondering if the prices will drop lower on Black Friday, or if it's worth shopping early, so let's answer some of your questions, and show you some of the best deals. We are currently just 11 days away from Black Friday, so it's time to get serious here.</p>

      <p>That's right, some of the advertised Black Friday pricing is available starting right now. You can save pretty big chunks of change on a variety of products. Let's take a look at some of the best deals that you can buy today so you skip the lines later this month.</p>
      <h4>Amazon Fire TV 4K w/ Echo Dot Bundle</h4>
      <p>This combo deal scores you a huge 53% discount when you pick up both the Echo Dot 3rd-gen and the Fire TV Stick 4K. At just $47, this is actually less than one of the pieces sells for when not on sale. Currently, the Fire TV Stick 4K is $49.99 on its own, so why not save a few bucks and get a free Echo Dot in the process, right?</p>

There are some exclusive color options that you can only get on Amazon, and right now all the color options are discounted.

The larger Pixel 3a XL is also on sale if you want something a little bigger with more battery capacity.

      <h3>Disney Plus</h3>
      <p>Disney+ has finally arrived! Now that the streaming service is ready for members in select countries including the United States and Canda, it's time to figure out the best way to sign up and start streaming!

Clipping the $20 off on-page coupon makes this Meross Smart Garage Opener kit the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. You can install it in just minutes and once it's all set up you can get alerts of the garage door status right to your phone, and even open and close it from anywhere in the world without worrying.</p>

      <h4>IPVanish VPN Subscription</h4>
      <p>Things are not what they used to be, and unfortunately not everyone can be trusted. Whether you're browsing from home or at a cafe, doing it on an unsecured connection can be dangerous. VPNs have become more popular in the recent years, and there's a good reason for it. IPVanish is one of our favorite services, and thanks to its Black Friday pricing you can get protected for as little as $3.25 a month when you redeem coupon code <b>CYBERDEAL19</b>.</p>
      <figure>

      <h4>Amazon Echo Dot w/Clock + Smart Plug</h4>
      <p>This updated Dot was only released a few weeks ago but you can already make a killer saving on it. Amazon is offering a bundle with a free smart plug, or you can grab it with a smart bulb instead for just $5 more. This looks just like the 3rd-gen Echo Dot did, with the exception of the built-in LED clock that shows you the time. It's great for night stands, desks, and more.</p>

      <h4>Amazon Music Unlimited</h4>
      <p>Ahead of the big Black Friday push, Amazon has discounted its own Music Unlimited streaming service. You can get four months of access, which includes millions of songs that you can access anywhere using an app on your phone or tablet, for just $1. This saves you about $39 compared to the regular price, and makes it a no-brainer choice. It's 25 cents a month, how can you pass that up?</p>

The carrier is offering 12GB of data for just $15 a month, but you need to prepay for 3 months. That means you pay $45 to get three months of service, after which it renews at regular pricing.</p>

      <h4>Apple AirPods Pro</h4>
      <p>Black Friday is sure to bring <a href="https://www.imore.com/best-airpods-deals-black-friday">lots of deals to the AirPods lineup</a>, but one of the best is here right now. The recently-released AirPods Pro are already discounted at Amazon, which is a bit rare. We don't see many discounts on new Apple products, but that's not stopping these from being on sale. There is a shipping delay to make note of, though it's likely that Amazon will have stock available earlier than what's advertised.</p>

      <h3>Should you shop pre-Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>The answer here is not cut and dry, but in most cases we would say yes. You should absolutely already be shopping sales, and picking up things as you see them on sale. Many retailers have already dropped the Black Friday sale ads, so you can easily compare the pricing listed there to what it's available for right now. If the prices match, click buy now. There is no benefit to waiting for Black Friday and risking the item selling out or forgetting to purchase it, and being stuck then paying full price.</p>
      <h3>Will Black Friday bring lower prices?</h3>
      <p>You may or may not find lower pricing than you see right now on Black Friday itself. Retailers don't show off every single item that will be available at a discount and list the price ahead of the event, unfortunately, which means you have to take a risk. You'll need to weigh your options when shopping for some stuff, but keep in mind that making the purchase now is likely less stressful, and you won't have to worry about it selling out before you complete the transaction or missing out on the price you see.</p>
      <h3>Where should you look for Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>When it comes to Black Friday, just about everyone under the sun will be offering discounts. If you want to keep your searches under control, we'd recommend keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">Amazon's Black Friday</a> offerings, along with <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-buy-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">deals at Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">don't forget to check out Walmart</a> during your pricing comparisons. These retailers offer a wide variety of product assortment, and will honestly all probably be price matching eachother during the lead up to Black Friday and on the big day.</p>
