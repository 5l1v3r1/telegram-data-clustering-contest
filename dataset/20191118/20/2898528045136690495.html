      <h1>Derrick Lewis expected to welcome Ilir Latifi to heavyweight at UFC card in February</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:12:12+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/939/derrick-lewis">Derrick Lewis</a> is expected to welcome <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2265/ilir-latifi">Ilir Latifi</a> to the heavyweight division in a fight currently targeted for a UFC card on Feb. 8 that’s expected to take place in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>While the card hasn’t been announced by the promotion, the Feb. 8 show is rumored to be the UFC 247 pay-per-view, but nothing has been made official just yet.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources close to the situation confirmed verbal agreements are in place for the fight when speaking to MMA Fighting on Monday following an initial report from <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28109216/sources-ufc-close-finalizing-derrick-lewis-ilir-latifi">ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>If the show is finalized for the Toyota Center in Houston, Lewis will get the chance to perform close to home as he looks to build on his recent win over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/684/blagoy-ivanov">Blagoy Ivanov</a> at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1054/ufc-244">UFC 244</a>. Lewis has gone 4-2 in his past six fights including wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3362/francis-ngannou">Francis Ngannou</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/850/alexander-volkov">Alexander Volkov</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Latifi will test the waters in the heavyweight division after spending his entire UFC career competing at 205 pounds.</p>
      <p>The Swedish “Sledgehammer” will attempt to bounce back from consecutive losses, which precipitated the move up in weight for his return to action.</p>
      <p>Lewis vs. Latifi is the latest rumored bout for the Feb. 8 card with more fights expected to be added in the coming weeks in anticipation of the UFC officially announcing the event.</p>
