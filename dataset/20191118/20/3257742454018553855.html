These lenses clip on to the phone and provided extra photography and video features such as a macro zoom for what the company describes as like using a "digital microscope."<br/><br/>"With the arrival of the iPhone 11 series and Samsung's new S series, Olloclip is proud to continue innovating exciting solutions for mobile photographers who just want to shoot on their phones," said CEO Jim Weisz.<br/><br/>"Olloclip's unique unibody clips make attachment to the phone a breeze, and our precise engineering ensures that whatever lens is being used fits perfectly every time," he continued.</p>

On their own, lenses come in one of ten types from telephoto to ultrawide, and costing from $39.99 to $119.99. Users have to also buy a clip in order to add any of the lenses to their phones, and that retails for $29.99.</p>
