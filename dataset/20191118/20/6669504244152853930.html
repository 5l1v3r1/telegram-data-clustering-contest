      <p>Friends of slain Lake Country woman Arlene Westervelt are awaiting justice, “whatever that may look like.”</p>
      <p>Gathered at the Kelowna Law Courts today, Nov. 18, for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing for Arlene’s accused killer, her husband Lambertus Westervelt, friends said that they will keep going to court to honour her.</p>
      <p>"She doesn't have a voice, so we're here to support her and show our love, and just be there for her," Cathy Vissia, a friend of Arlene’s said outside the courtroom.</p>
      <p>Vissia was among a group of six at the brief court date who were close to Arlene in life and she said she still feels the loss of her running buddy.</p>
      <p>“She was active, vivacious, kind compassionate and always wanted to have the next adventure,” said Vissia. “She was very energetic, and a wonderful friend and I just miss her."</p>
      <p>Arlene’s body was recovered June 27, 2016, from Okanagan Lake near Okanagan Centre, in Lake Country.</p>
      <p>She had been canoeing with a man about 100 feet from shore, RCMP said in a press release at the time, when the canoe tipped over and she fell into the water. Neither person was wearing a lifejacket.</p>
      <p>She was found in 35 feet of water, approximately 100 feet from the shore, by trained divers with the RCMP underwater recovery team.</p>
      <p>Investigators initially thought Arlene's death was a tragic accident. But on April 6, 2019, Westervelt was arrested and charged with second degree murder.</p>
      <p>The yet-to-be scheduled preliminary hearing is expected to last five weeks.</p>
