      <p>A California prosecutor allegedly used his 13-year-old daughter as bait to catch an elderly man who the teen said had sexually molested her, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>The sexual assault suspect was arrested — but now state prosecutors are also exploring potential child endangerment charges against the girl’s father, a Santa Clara County prosecutor, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/17/a-san-jose-prosecutor-wanted-to-catch-a-molester-he-used-his-daughter-as-bait/">The Mercury News reported</a>, citing police reports and sources familiar with the case.</p>
      <p>Police were conducting an active investigation into the molestation when the prosecutor — who was not identified to protect the identity of his daughter — brought her back to the scene as part of the rogue sting operation, the Los Alamitos Trail in Almaden Valley, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor told police he used cell phones and earbuds to stay in touch with his daughter as she walked along the trail, the paper reported.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor reached out to police on Nov. 11 saying he had video of the suspect walking with his arm around his daughter’s waist and even grabbing her arm to stop her from leaving him, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“He stated that they had already done this several times,” San Jose Det. Sgt. Sean Pierce wrote in a police report obtained by The Mercury News. “He directed (the victim) to let (the suspect) touch her if she encountered him, but if it was the breast or between the legs to move away. He instructed (the victim) to let (the suspect) identify and make the contact and if she cannot handle things she should move away. He instructed (the victim) to walk back and forth on the designated route and don’t interact with anyone for very long.”</p>

      <p>The next day, Ali Mohammad Lajmiri, 76, was busted on charges of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 and false imprisonment, the paper reported.</p>
      <p>Authorities began probing the teen’s sexual assault allegation Oct. 8, a day after the victim told her doctor she’d been sexually assaulted, according to the report. She told police that in three cases between August and October, the man touched her sexually as she walked her dog on the trail.</p>
      <p>State prosecutors are handling both the case against the teen’s father and the initial molestation case due to the conflict of interest, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The Santa Clara District Attorney’s Office declined to specifically comment to the outlet about the prosecutor’s alleged actions.</p>
      <p>“As in all cases of sexual assault, our hearts go out to the victim and her family,” Assistant DA Terry Harman said in a statement. “We have recused ourselves from the handling of any filing decision and prosecution of any matters related to this situation.”</p>
      <p>The San Jose police chief did not go into detail about the case itself but advised the public to avoid taking the law into their own hands.</p>
      <p>“As a father, I understand how emotional it can be when your child is the victim of a crime,” Garcia told the paper. “But we have to remember that the safety of the child comes first and channel that frustration in a positive way to assist the investigation and not hinder it.”</p>
