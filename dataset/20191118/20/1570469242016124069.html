      <p>Police used water cannon to disperse protesters near Georgia's parliament on Monday and arrested several people calling for an early election.</p>
      <p>The violence broke out a day after 20,000 people rallied in the centre of the Georgian capital Tbilisi to protest against the government and demand an early parliamentary election.</p>
      <p>Dozens of protesters gathered in four places near parliament on Monday shouting "Long live Georgia!".</p>
      <p>Hundreds of police officers were then deployed to the scene, who gave protesters 30 minutes to disperse before using water cannon. A Reuters reporter saw two policemen firing tear gas at a crowd at one of the locations, though police later denied using teargas.</p>
      <p>Opposition activists said more than 20 protesters, including some opposition leaders, had been arrested.</p>
      <p>One group of protesters remained in front of parliament afterwards, some giving speeches on a stage as police looked on.</p>
      <p>Members of the ruling Georgia Dream party managed to get into the parliament building and attend a meeting after three of its entrances were opened. Opposition lawmakers did not attend the meeting.</p>
      <p>Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze said the opposition's actions went beyond peaceful demonstrations and that blocking entrances to parliament was illegal.</p>
      <p>"The police acted competently and within the law," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The protest took place days after the ex-Soviet country's parliament failed to pass a planned electoral reform, a move to full proportional representation from the mixed system at present.</p>
      <p>Currently, almost half of the lawmakers in parliament are elected not by party lists, but in single-mandate constituencies.</p>
      <p>The European Union's delegation in Georgia and the US Embassy released a joint statement on Monday saying they recognised "the deep disappointment of a wide segment of Georgian society" at parliament's failure to pass the constitutional amendments.</p>
      <p>"We consider it essential to immediately work to restore trust through a calm and respectful dialogue between the government and all political parties and civil society with a view to finding an acceptable path forward," they said in the statement.</p>
