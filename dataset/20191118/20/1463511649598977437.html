      <h1>National Assembly has no power to enact law on hate speech for states – Falana</h1>

      <p>A Human Rights Lawyer, Femi Falana, says that the National Assembly has no power to enact a law on hate speech for the entire country.</p>
      <p>Falana said this while discussing as a panelist at Digital Voting Summit organised by RestoreNaija, an NGO, on Monday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said that such law was not with the purview of the NASS but the state.</p>
      <p>The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said that while the issue of hate speech fell under residual list, the National Assembly was empowered to legislate on exclusive and concurrent lists.</p>
      <p>“Under Section 4 of the Constitution, NASS can only legislative on matters in the exclusive and concurrent lists.</p>
      <p>“I have looked at those lists, I have not found anyway where the NASS has been empowered to make the law on hate speech. It is a state affair on residual list.</p>
      <p>“Let everybody know his or her limitations of power so that we will not make mistake.</p>
      <p>“If you want to proscribe death penalty, you can do so in your state. In Lagos State for instance, the execution of death penalty has been declared illegal by a court in Lagos.</p>
      <p>“Whether you want to kill someone by hanging or firing squad, the court in Lagos has said that it is against Section 34 that has abolished any form of torture.”</p>
      <p>According to him, if any state wants to legislate on hate speech, it can do so it within its jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Falana said that the Cybercrime Act had taken care of the entire fiats regarding hate speech by making stringent conditions, including fine and prison terms for offenders.</p>
