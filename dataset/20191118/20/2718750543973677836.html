      <h1><i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i> Renewed, Long May Kellyoke Reign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:38:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author">Justin Curto</a></address>
      <p>Get your requests ready: <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i> announced that it’ll return for the 2020–21 season, meaning another season full of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/kellyoke-covers-kelly-clarkson-show-backstory.html">the Kellyoke covers that captivated us in the first place</a>. The daytime show, syndicated in 100 percent of the country, earned its early second-season renewal by ranking as the top new daytime show, and we have a good idea of how it got there. Clarkson has impressed us day after day with covers of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kelly-clarkson-covers-whitney-houston-i-want-to-dance-with-somebody.html">Whitney Houston</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/kelly-clarkson-covers-lizzo-juice.html">Lizzo</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/kelly-clarkson-cover-bad-romance-video.html">Lady Gaga</a>, and has shown us that she can do everything from rap an Eve song to belt a hit by her <i>Idol</i> successor Carrie Underwood. The woman even performed <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kelly-clarkson-covers-hocus-pocus-i-put-a-spell-on-you.html">her Halloween cover</a> in a <i>Hocus Pocus</i> costume! Now, don’t get confused amid this exciting renewal news — we’re still in the middle of <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i> season one, with plenty more covers to go. Let’s just hope she doesn’t run out of song options anytime soon.</p>
