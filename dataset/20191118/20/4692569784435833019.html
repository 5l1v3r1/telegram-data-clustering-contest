      <h1>The Linux who command tells who’s logged in and a lot more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:36:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itworld.com/author/Network-World-staff/" target="_blank">Network World staff</a></address>
      <p>Did you ever wonder who is logged into a Linux system but not know how to find out? This two-minute tip can solve the problem with an introduction to the <b>who</b> command in this 2-minute Linux Tip by Network World blogger Sandra Henry-Stocker.</p>
      <p>The <b>who </b>command can tell you who is logged in to the network, count them and give a list of them on a single line. It can also show when a system was last booted as well as the run state that the system is in.</p>
      <p>For those who don’t want to use the formal commands for the various <b>who</b> functions, it’s possible to create aliases that are more intuitive than the commands as written for Linux.</p>
