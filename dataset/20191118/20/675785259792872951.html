      <h1>Giovanna Fletcher's 'terrifying' motorway ordeal as severe pain left her unable to breathe</h1>
      <h2>The wife of McFly's Tom Fletcher opened up about her 'extremely scary' ordeal which happened during a solo trip on the motorway</h2>

      <p>As distressing experiences go, developing severe chest pain while driving alone on a motorway must be up there as one of the more unpleasant.</p>
      <p>And that was the terrifying situation in which author Giovanna Fletcher found herself on a journey from London to see her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tom-fletcher">McFly star husband Tom</a> play a gig in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>"I started getting shooting pains where I literally couldn't breathe in – and if I did it it caused this massive stabbing sensation across my chest," recalls Giovanna, 34.</p>
      <p>"I remember I came to a junction and just kept going around that loop while I focused on breathing shallowly, because if I took in too much air it was agony.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't hunched over in pain – but the uncertainty of not knowing what's going on and when it’s going to stop is awful. It went on for a couple of minutes and was extremely scary."</p>

      <p>The incident 10 years ago wasn’t the first time Giovanna experienced the sensation, but it was one of the lengthiest attacks.</p>
      <p>"I don't remember where I was the first time it happened, but I thought I was having a heart attack," says Giovanni, then working in London as a children's chaperone. "Thankfully the pain subsided in about a minute and I felt fine again.</p>
      <p>"I decided if it were life threatening it wouldn't have cleared up so quickly, so rather than heading to the hospital I made an appointment with my GP for the same day."</p>

      <p>Her doctor carried out tests and, once happy it wasn’t anything immediately life threatening, referred Giovanna to a specialist.</p>
      <p>"While I was waiting for my appointment to come around the attacks were happening, several times a day at their worst," she says.</p>
      <p>Turning to Dr <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> didn't help allay her fears. “It was coming up with heart failure and all sorts,” says Giovanna, who has written four novels including You're the One That I Want and Dream a Little Dream.</p>

      <p>“Google is your worst enemy and then your best friend at times. I’m still bad at that now – when anything flares up I have a look, but I have to stop myself because there’s no monitoring what’s on the internet.”</p>
      <p>There was even a moment when Giovanna debated whether she had been suffering panic attacks.</p>
      <p>“I did wonder, as I have friends who have called an ambulance thinking they were having a heart attack, only to be told it was a panic attack,” says Giovanna.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t feel particularly stressed at the time but sometimes there’s no rhyme or reason to these things.”</p>
      <p>After one particularly painful episode Giovanna went to A&amp;E. “The staff were fantastic, they gave me an ECG straight away and a chest X-ray just to make sure it wasn’t anything life threatening.”</p>
      <p>Eventually, after several months of waiting, she saw a consultant and was told she had costochondritis, an inflammation of rib cage cartilage.</p>

      <p>The condition usually affects the cartilage where the upper ribs attach to the breastbone and can cause chest pain of varying severity, with sufferers often describing heart attack-like symptoms.There was no explanation why Giovanna had developed the condition, and no cure.</p>
      <p>Luckily, by the time she was diagnosed, the episodes were less frequent. But her most recent attack was just a few weeks ago, “It was mild, but enough to tell me, ‘I’m still here, just lingering’. I never know when it will flare up,” she says.</p>

      <p>Giovanna and Tom, 34, have three sons, Buzz, five, Buddy, three and Max, one. And while Giovanna’s costochondritis has largely disappeared, being an expectant mother seemed to aggravate it.</p>
      <p>“It flared up during all my pregnancies.” she says. “I knew what it was by then, but I wanted to make sure it wasn’t putting any strain on my heart or the muscles around it so I got myself checked out again.</p>
      <p>“The doctors said it was nothing to worry about.”</p>

      <p>These days, Giovanna is slowing down and trying to look after herself a little more. It’s one of the reasons she has created a range for Boots to help people “enjoy the simple, joyful things in life” including a gratitude journal and portable coffee mug.</p>
      <p>"I think we look at self-care as something that will take up loads of the day, but for me it’s the little things. Simply reflecting on the positives, like those times when I’m dropping the boys off for the day, makes a difference to how I feel.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is safe in the back of the car, we're listening to music and I'm able to enjoy a hot coffee. Taking a moment to appreciate that moment, to me that’s self care."</p>
