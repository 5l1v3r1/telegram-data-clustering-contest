      <p>A man, who was waiting to refill air in his car tyres at a fuel station on Pushta Road in Rajendra Place, has been robbed of his gold chain by two bike-borne men, the police said on Monday. The incident was caught on a CCTV camera.</p>
      <p>The incident happened when victim Sandeep Bhola came out of his car to ask the petrol pump staff to refill air in his car tyres. Two men riding a motorbike drove past him and snatched his gold chain. Mr. Bhola ran after them but the duo went to the wrong side of the road on their two-wheeler and sped away. The victim told the police that the snatchers were not wearing any helmet or mask.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bhola said he was on his way home after visiting his in-laws when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>The police have obtained the CCTV footage of the incident and are examining it to get registration number of the bike. “An FIR has been registered,” said a senior police officer.</p>
