      <p>Second breakfast? How about a second season?</p>
      <p>Although production for Amazon's<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/lord-of-the-rings-tv/"> </a><i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/lord-of-the-rings-tv/">Lord of the Rings</a> </i>TV series has not even started, the series has already been renewed for Season 2.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/">Deadline</a></i>, the streaming service has commissioned the writer's room to begin working on the fantasy series' second season. Production on Season 1 is expected to take place in New Zealand in the months ahead. Following the completion of the first two episodes, the series will go on a four to five month production hiatus, which is when the writer's room will map out and write the Season 2 scripts.</p>

      <p>Amazon acquired the right to <i>Lord of Rings </i>two years ago. The deal included a multi-season <i>Lord of the Rings </i>series as well as a potential spinoff series. It will be based on the novels by J.R.R Tolkien's -- which previously inspired director Peter Jackson's beloved film trilogy -- and take place during Middle Earth's Second Age, before the events of the main trilogy.</p>
      <p><i>The Lord of the Rings </i>TV series is produced by Amazon Studios. J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay serve as showrunners. J.A. Bayona will direct the first two episodes, as well as produce alongside Belén Atienza. Writers Gennifer Hutchison, Jason Cahill and Justin double executive produce alongside Lindsey Weber, Bruce Richmond, Gene Kelly and Sharon Tal Yguado.</p>
