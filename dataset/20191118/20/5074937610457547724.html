      <p>Kumasi, Nov. 18, GNA - A three-day exercise to enforce voluntary payment of the one per cent Tourism Levy, has begun in the Ashanti Region.</p>
      <p>It is also to promote quality standards, safety and security in the tourism industry.</p>
      <p>The Levy, stipulated in the Tourism Act 817 of 2011, is meant to provide the requisite resources for sustainable development of the tourism industry.</p>
      <p>Mr Prince Yaw Essah, Administrator of the Tourism Development Fund, said the exercise was to ensure strict compliance in the payment of the Levy.</p>
      <p>It is also meant to recover arrears owed by facility operators to put GTA in a better position to market and promote Ghana's tourist resources.</p>
      <p>Mr Essah in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA), urged stakeholders, especially key players in the tourism industry to strive to do the right thing.</p>
      <p>This was because the Levy paid by users of tourism establishments or units in the form of indirect tax was ultimately to the benefit of the nation.</p>
      <p>The Administrator said the exercise would see the taskforce visiting more than 50 tourism facilities in the Region, to verify how they were complying with the payment of the Levy.</p>
      <p>Mr Ekow Sampson, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in-charge of Operations, GTA, indicated that tourism had huge potentials, which could be tapped for job and wealth creation.</p>
      <p>Stakeholders should, therefore, be supportive of the work of the GTA in the interest of all and sundry.</p>
      <p>The first day of the exercise saw the closure of Hotel La Sab and Abeh Cabayaro Hotel, all in Kumasi, for defaulting in the payment of the Levy for a number of years.</p>
