      <p>Oxford University said on Monday a golden ring given by Irish author Oscar Wilde to a close friend will be returned almost two decades after it was stolen from Magdalen College where he studied.</p>
      <p>Dutch art detective Arthur Brand recovered the ring and it will be handed back on December 4, said Mark Blandford-Baker, home bursar at Magdalen College.</p>
      <p>The 18-carat friendship band was jointly given by Wilde and fellow student Reginald Harding to William Ward in 1876 when they attended college.</p>
      <p>It was stolen in 2002 by cleaner Eamonn Andrews, who sold it for 150 pounds ($194).</p>
      <p>Its whereabouts have since been a mystery, but it was widely believed to have been melted down. It was worth roughly 35,000 pounds at the time.</p>
      <p>"We're very pleased to have it back. Years ago, the police thought it had probably been melted down by someone who did not realise its significance," said Blandford-Baker.</p>
      <p>The band bears the initials of Wilde, author of works including The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Importance of Being Earnest, and a Greek inscription that says: "Gift of love, to one who wishes love".</p>
      <p>Brand has helped to recover several key artworks, including a painting by Pablo Picasso that was stolen from a private Saudi owner's yacht in France in 1999.</p>
