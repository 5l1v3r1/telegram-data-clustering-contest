      <p>Has <b>Miley Cyrus</b> been secretly in love with <b>Kristen Stewart</b> for years? That’s what one of the tabloids is reporting. <b>Gossip Cop</b> looked into the claim and we’ve learned it’s bogus.</p>
      <p>“Miley’s Lusting After K-Stew!” reads a headline in the latest issue of <i><b>NW</b></i>. An alleged insider is quoted as saying, “Kristen is Miley’s biggest life crush. She’s been trying to date her since before her foam finger days, but it was never the right time.” The supposed source goes on to say that Cyrus tried hooking up with Stewart following her split from Liam Hemsworth in August, but couldn’t make it happen because the actress is dating screenwriter Dylan Meyer. The singer was then forced to have rebound romances with Kaitlynn Carter and current boyfriend Cody Simpson, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>“Miley left Liam because she’s never been able to get Kristen out of her heads,” adds the questionable tipster. “She saw her in February at an Oscars dinner and it reignited feelings. It pretty much forced the end of her marriage a few months later.” Meanwhile, Stewart said on <i>The Howard Stern Show</i> last week that she’s eager to marry Meyer, who she’s been dating for the past several months. The “insider” says Cyrus was devastated when she heard the interview as “there may never be a right time for them.” The seemingly phony source adds, “Miley’s in mourning and Cody has no idea.”</p>
      <p>The tabloid’s report is both random and ridiculous. The only true aspect of the entire article is that Cyrus and Stewart hung out at a pre-Oscar dinner back in February. The singer hasn’t been pining for the actress since then, and her split from Hemsworth had nothing to do with the <i>Twilight</i> star. It’s possible this phony narrative was invented because Cyrus recorded a song for the <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> reboot, in which Stewart stars. <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with a source close to the situation, who dismisses the tabloid’s piece as total fiction.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cyrus’ relationship with Simpson is still going strong and the idea she was “forced” to settle with him is ludicrous. <i>People</i> magazine recently reported that <a href="https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-recovering-vocal-cord-surgery-cody-simpson-by-her-side-source/">Simpson has been at Cyrus’ side as she recovers at home</a> after undergoing vocal cord surgery last week. The two seem very happy together, and Cyrus isn’t begrudgingly dating the Australian singer because she can’t have Stewart.</p>
      <p>Oddly enough, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out a different tabloid last week for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/kristen-stewart-miley-cyrus-hate/">Stewart has secretly hated Cyrus for years</a>. That scenario isn’t true either. For whatever reason, the gossip media insists on linking the two stars. It’s also worth noting, we busted <i>NW</i> earlier this month for wrongly reporting <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-engaged/">Cyrus and Simpson were engaged</a>. This latest article makes no mention of an engagement, but instead says the singer’s heart belongs to Stewart. The reason none of these stories align with each other is because they’re all made-up.</p>
