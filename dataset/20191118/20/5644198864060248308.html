      <p>MIREPOIX-SUR-TRN, France: A 15-year-old girl was killed after a suspension bridge over a river in southwest France collapsed on Monday (Nov 18), causing a car, a truck and possibly a third vehicle to plunge into the water, local authorities said.</p>
      <p>Four people were rescued but several others were feared missing after the collapse of the bridge between Mirepoix-sur-Tarn and Bessieres, 30km north of Toulouse, said fire service and local security chief Etienne Guyot.</p>

      <p>A car bonnet could be seen sticking out of the water as helicopters circled overhead and emergency workers in inflatable boats searched for survivors.</p>
      <p>More than 60 emergency service members, including divers, were taking part in the rescue operation, Guyot told reporters, adding there were "probably several missing".</p>
      <p>Among those feared missing were the truck driver and the driver of a potential third vehicle, Guyot said, adding that witnesses had reported seeing a van on the bridge.</p>
      <p>The dead girl was travelling by car across the bridge with her mother when it collapsed.</p>
      <p>Her body was retrieved from the river, which is 100m wide and more than 20m deep at the level of the bridge.</p>
      <p>The girl's mother was pulled alive from the sunken car by bystanders, some of whom were badly injured in the rescue attempt.</p>
      <p>Two rescue workers were also seriously hurt, according to the region's security department.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"IMPORTANT CROSSING POINT"</b>
      </p>
      <p>An investigation into the cause of the accident was underway.</p>
      <p>The bridge, dated to 1931, had a load limit of 19 tonnes and was "regularly checked", Guyot said.</p>
      <p>The Haute-Garonne department council said the bridge had undergone a "thorough" inspection in 2017, which had shown "no structural problem".</p>

      <p>Mirepoix-sur-Tarn mayor Eric Oget described it as a "very important crossing point" for people going to work in the regionla capital Toulouse on the other side of the river.</p>
      <p>Many pedestrians used the bridge, he said, describing the collapse as a "real trauma" for the local population.</p>
      <p>Oget said articulated lorries were not allowed onto the bridge but that some had nonetheless been seen crossing over in the past.</p>
      <p>He said he had no information on whether the fallen truck exceeded the allowed weight.</p>
      <p>The issue of bridge safety was thrust into the spotlight in Europe after the collapse of a motorway bridge in the Italian city of Genoa in August 2018, in which 43 people died.</p>

      <p>An audit of France's bridges commissioned by the Senate in the wake of the Genoa disaster called for major investments to avoid a similar tragedy in France.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately what happened illustrates what we said in the report, which is that the state of our bridges poses a real danger," senator Herve Maure, who oversaw the audit, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"If a bridge which is not listed as dangerous collapses, what is the situation of those bridges which were clearly identified as dangerous in the report?" he said.</p>
