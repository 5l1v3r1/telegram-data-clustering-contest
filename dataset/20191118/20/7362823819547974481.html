      <h1>10-year-old's pricey Christmas list goes viral via Twitter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:42:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Hollan</a></address>
      <p>This kid had better have been good this year.</p>
      <p>A father shared his 10-year-old daughter’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle">Christmas list</a> on social media and it might be one of the strangest gift lists any child has ever assembled. Apparently, the girl has big plans for Christmas morning.</p>

      <p>The father, posting under the Twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/a_johnson412/status/1194689352992903169">A_Johnson412</a>, shared an image of the gift list with the caption, “My 10-year-old daughter must be out of her mind with this Christmas list.”</p>
      <p>The list starts off swinging for the fences, with the 10-year-old asking for an iPhone 11, Air Pods and a MacBook Air (she specifies that it be a new computer as well). Then, she asks for a “real” bunny (much further down the list, she also asks for clothes for the bunny).</p>

      <p>While these are all big gifts, they’re also normal enough. Oddly, the list takes a bizarre turn towards the bottom, where she asks for $4,000, food coloring and laundry detergent.</p>
      <p>The list closes out with a hilariously simple request for an alarm clock (a feature built into the iPhone 11, so her dad might be able to save some money there).</p>
      <p>Based on her father’s caption, it’s unlikely she’ll be getting everything on her list.</p>

      <p>Twitter users were generally amused with the girl’s requests, with one <a href="https://twitter.com/JasVela_/status/1194987905959301120">posting</a>, “Get her that alarm clock sis! Lol tell her it’ll wake her up from that dream where she thinks she’s getting everything on there.”</p>
      <p>Others were actually impressed, with one reply <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsKamillah/status/1195024978674098176">reading</a>, “An alarm clock, Gucci slides and some laundry detergent? Mama has range and her priorities in check!”</p>

      <p>Several users questioned what a 10-year-old would do with $4,000, but it seems likely that this kid would find a use for the money.</p>
