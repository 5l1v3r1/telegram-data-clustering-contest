      <h1>Hip hop duo City Morgue hints at a new Rockstar game coming next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:02:35+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>It appears that Rockstar Games could be moving in earnest toward the next Grand Theft Auto reveal: Earlier this month, hip hop group City Morgue shared an image on Instagram suggesting that it was involved in a partnership with the studio that would be revealed next summer.</p>

      <p>There's no direct reference to the series, but music is a major part of the GTA series and while I'm not familiar with City Morgue's work, I think it's safe to say that it'd be a good fit for a radio station or two. It's possible that the tweet is related to a new Bully game instead, although that seems like a bit more of a stretch, as does the possibility of a Bully sequel <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bully-2-leak-confirmed-fake/">in general</a>.</p>
      <p>As noted last week by <a href="https://www.psu.com/news/rockstar-job-ad-reveals-its-working-on-open-world-character-based-games-for-next-gen/">PlayStation Universe</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/a-new-rockstar-project-for-2020-has-just-been-teased-by-american-hip-hop-group-city-morgue/">GamesRadar</a>), Rockstar recently posted a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/careers/openings/position/efc5f5a0">job listing</a> for a animation systems engineer, "to help us in developing advanced animation systems for large open world character-based games." That description could be fairly applied to other Rockstar games, though, including Grand Theft Auto 5, which despite being six years old is still tremendously popular, and maintain a solid grip in the top ten most popular games on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/">Steam</a>.</p>
      <p>Rockstar has collaborated with numerous musicians in GTA5 previously—<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/grand-theft-auto-5-has-a-new-radio-station-hosted-by-frank-ocean/">Frank Ocean</a> got his own personal radio station—and it's possible that this could be a something similar to last year's appearance of Tale of Us, Dixon, Solomun, and The Black Madonna in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-online-teases-star-studded-techno-summer-soundtrack/">GTA Online</a>. But the temporal distance makes me think that this could be something bigger. The Black Madonna teased the "summer 2018" GTA Online appearance just a couple of months before it happened, not half a year.</p>
      <p>Whatever's going on, it does appear to be serious: Via redditor Wardoganthem187, City Morgue said that more information would be coming "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zillakami/comments/du2gtr/did_these_niggas_just_reveal_that_a_new_game/">soon</a>." Steven Ogg, who voiced Trevor Philips in GTA5, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-5s-trevor-says-gta-6-is-releasing-soon-but-does-steven-ogg-know-something-we-dont/">said the same thing</a> during the recent Brazil Game Show, and with new console hardware expected to arrive at the end of 2020, a mid-year reveal of a next-gen GTA wouldn't surprise me at all.</p>
