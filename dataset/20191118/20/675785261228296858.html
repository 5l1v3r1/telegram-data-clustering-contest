      <h1>Most dangerous countries in the world to travel to in 2020 detailed in interactive map</h1>
      <h2>An interactive Travel Risk Map, created by International SOS, has been launched which shows which country travellers should avoid in all circumstances</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:09:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:09</time> by <a rel="author">Zara Whelan</a></address>
      <p>A new interactive map has revealed the most dangerous countries in the world to travel to.</p>
      <p>It will come as no surprise that war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Sudan are all listed as having the highest travel security risk.</p>
      <p>But the Travel Risk Map also warns against Haiti along with North Korea, Venezula, Liberia and Niger, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/most-dangerous-places-travel-2020-17273829">Manchester Evening News</a> .</p>
      <p>They all score 'very high' when it comes to health risk - including infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>The map, created by security and risk experts  <a href="https://www.internationalsos.com/risk-outlook">International SOS</a> , ranks the safety of countries across the globe in terms of medical, security and road risks.</p>
      <p>For the first two categories, countries are given a rating out of five, while road safety is rated out of four based on the mortality rate per 100,000 people.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Those visiting Europe, the USA, Japan, South Korea, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand all have the lowest chance of catching a disease while travelling.</p>
      <p>When it comes to security threat to travellers is negligible in places such as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Slovenia, Greenland and Finland.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Travel security risk levels are considered low (rather than insignificant) in the UK and Ireland - on par with the rest of Europe, the US and Canada, China, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Some of the world’s most dangerous roads are in Vietnam, Venezuela, Belize, Saudi Arabia, the Dominican Republic, South Africa and Thailand.</p>
      <p>However UK roads are considered safe by comparison, along with most of Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Japan being ranked as low risk.</p>

      <p>International SOS MD Doug Quarry said: "The threats facing organisations and their workforces are impacting established and emerging economies alike.</p>
      <p>"It’s encouraging to see that decision makers are becoming increasingly aware of the threats of epidemics and infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>"With accurate information, tools and support in place, organisations should, and can, plan for the anticipated risks and safeguard their investment and their people."</p>
      <p>Travel Risk Map is an annual rating review of the prevalent travel medical and security risks across the world in terms of Risk Ratings. All risk ratings shown are taken in November 2019.</p>
      <p>You can check the risk ratings of any country of choice via the interactive map <a href="https://www.travelriskmap.com/">here</a> .</p>
