      <p>Ade Adesomoju, Abuja</p>
      <p>The Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, (SAN), said on Monday that he had not received any formal communication on the alleged arrest of his immediate-past predecessor, Mr. Bello Adoke (SAN), in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>Malami disclosed this in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu.</p>
      <p>Online newspaper,<i> TheCable</i>, reported on Sunday that Adoke was arrested by international police in Dubai on the strength of an arrest warrant issued by a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Abuja.</p>
      <p>It reported that the arrest warrant was later vacated by the same court.</p>
      <p>Reacting to his predecessor’s reported arrest, Malami said, on Monday, “My office as the Attorney General Federation and Minister of Justice of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is not in receipt of any formal communication regarding the alleged arrest in line with international conventions, processes and procedures relating to such matter.</p>
      <p>“Until such formal communication is received the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice would not comment speculatively in one way or the other over the matter.”</p>
      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had preferred charges in relation to the $1.1bn Malabu Oil scam against Adoke and others since 2017.</p>
      <p>But the anti-graft agency had not been able to arraign the defendants due to the self-exile Adoke had placed himself on since 2015 shortly after he left the office.</p>
