      <p>The Delhi Police said that its personnel did not use sticks or lathis during the protest march by Jawaharlal Nehru University students on Monday. The march began from the university and was contained near Safdarjung Tomb, said the police.</p>
      <p>“Delhi Police staff acted with restraint... despite continued defiance by some groups of students, the police resorted to methods of persuasion. There was no use of water cannons, tear-gas shells or lathi-charge at any point,” said Delhi Police Additional Public Relations Officer Anil Mittal.</p>
      <p>Around 30 police personnel and 15 students were injured during the day-long protest, said an officer.</p>
      <h3>‘Released in evening’</h3>
      <p>The police said that around 100 students were detained during the protest march and were taken to different police stations, including Badarpur and Fatehpur Beri police stations.</p>
      <p>They were released in the evening, they added.</p>
      <p>The force had made elaborate arrangements for the march, which the students had planned to start from the university and conclude at Parliament street.</p>
      <p>The police had put up barricades at several points, including the main gate of JNU, but the students managed to overcome the obstacles and reach Safadarjung Tomb where they were eventually contained.</p>
      <h3>Huge deployment</h3>
      <p>Over 800 officials and 10 companies of Central Armed Police Force (CRPF) were deployed to maintain law and order.</p>
      <p>Senior officers, including Deputy Commissioners, Joint Commissioner and Special Commissioner were present at the spot.</p>
      <p>The police said that thousands of students who had gathered at the university were contained for a while, but subsequently started slipping away and took the Munirka Vihar route, which has nearly 20 entry and exit points to proceed towards New Delhi area.</p>
      <p>The students finally reached Safdarjung Tomb.</p>
      <p>“Some agitated students still attempted to forcibly break the barricades again and had to be pushed back,” Mr. Mittal said.</p>
      <p>The police said that students were constantly told by senior officers not to continue the march as a high- powered committee had been constituted to look into their demands.</p>
      <h3>Traffic snarls</h3>
      <p>In a parallel development, traffic at certain points in the Capital remained affected in the evening, including on Nelson Mandela Marg, Aurobindo Marg, Baba Gang Nath Marg, AIIMS flyover up till Prithviraj Road.</p>
      <p>Delhi Traffic Police updated commuters on social media advising them to take alternative routes.</p>
