      <p>Nearly a year after a Class VII girl was found dead, two teachers of a private school were arrested on Sunday evening on charges of abetment to suicide, the police said on Monday. The girl had alleged in a note that she was harassed by the teachers.</p>
      <p>On December 1 last year, the girl was found dead at her residence in west Delhiâ€™s Inderpuri when her mother, an advocate, reached home in the evening. A note was found at the spot in which she had alleged that her science teacher and class teacher harassed her and that the information of her death must reach the school authorities.</p>
      <p>As an FIR was not registered after the incident, the mother approached a Delhi court which ordered an FIR in the case. A case under Section 305 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code was then registered on February 15.</p>
      <p>Unsatisfied with the investigation by the district police, the mother approached the court again after which the case was transferred to the Crime Branch in April and an investigation was taken up. A police official privy to the probe said that statements of her classmates and friends were recorded and CCTV footage from the school was also obtained and examined.</p>
      <p>On Sunday evening, the two teachers were arrested from their residence and were produced before the court on Monday after which they were sent to judicial custody.</p>
      <p>On November 30 last year, the girl had come home and told her mother that she was scolded and humiliated by the teachers and that she did not want to go to school any more. On December 1, her mother let her stay at home and returned to find her dead.</p>
