      <h1>Myles Garrett was ‘defending himself’ against Mason Rudolph: Sheldon Richardson</h1>

      <p>A former Jet and current Browns teammate of Myles Garrett said the defensive end was “defending himself” when he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">bashed Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph in the head</a> with Rudolph’s helmet.</p>
      <p>“Of course he was,” Sheldon Richardson said Monday, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28108884/freddie-kitchens-says-browns-stand-myles-garrett">according to ESPN</a>. “If a guy [is] scratching at your face, what you going to [do]? The helmet is overboard, let’s get that clear. But defending yourself, I don’t blame him for defending [himself] at all.”</p>
      <p>Garrett was suspended indefinitely but at least for the rest of this season, including potential postseason games. The 23-year-old <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/myles-garrett-to-appeal-nfl-suspension-after-helmet-attack/">is appealing that suspension</a>.</p>
      <p>Richardson, a 2013 first-round pick by the Jets who joined the Browns this year on a three-year, $37 million deal, believes Rudolph should’ve been suspended for grabbing at Garrett’s helmet before Garrett snapped.</p>
      <p>“You can’t antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … you get what’s coming to you,” Richardson said. “Of course Myles overreacted. … He was protecting himself. I don’t blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he’s asking for it. Just leave it at that.”</p>
