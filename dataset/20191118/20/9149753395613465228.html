      <h1>There's a caveman hidden in the Red Dead Redemption 2 game files</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:31:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/james-davenport/" target="_blank">James Davenport</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-review/">Red Dead Redemption 2's</a> PC release means players can mine for secrets rather than just wait for Rockstar to make a move. In what's a discovery that's likely cut content, or something waiting in the wings for a future expansion or multiplayer update, Reddit user thatfalloutguy stumbled onto a complete caveman player model buried in the game files. </p>
      <p>The skin was discovered by using <a href="https://www.mod-rdr.com/files/file/7-lennys-simple-trainer/">Lenny's Simple Trainer</a>, a mod that allows players to enable cheats, transport around the map, and swap out player models with anything in the file directory. (Chris used it to turn <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-trainer/">into an eagle</a>.) </p>
      <p>By selecting model A_M_M_UniCorpse 01 and then using <a href="https://www.mod-rdr.com/files/file/12-rdr-2-outfit-changer/">RDR2 Outfit Manager</a> to swap to variation 45 of the base category, it's possible to inhabit the body of this husky boy. </p>

          <b>Be warned: </b>
        </i>
        <i>If you want to give the old guy a trial run, make sure autosaves are off while using mods, and don't hop into Red Dead Online. Any foreign files in the game directory can result in a ban from online modes. Remove the trainers and all associated files before the RDR2 root directory before enabling autosaves or resuming online play. </i>

      <p>Changing skins, even if you look flawless, ain't a flawless process. Since everyone's a stand-in for Arthur, it means our caveman can't play the all-important RDR2 fashion game, grow or shave facial hair, or use his status as early man to get a discount on giant turkey legs. </p>
      <p>The trainer is a bit buggy too. Whenever I sat down, the screen would pulse red as if I was going to die any minute, perhaps a warning from a guy who predated our modern back problems, someone who either worked on their feet stabbing huge mammals or did deep squats around the fire. </p>
      <p>Minor problems aside, watching the caveman do and say Arthur things doesn't get old. </p>
