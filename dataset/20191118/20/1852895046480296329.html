      <h4>Now that the cold weather is officially here, it’s time to swap out your body washes for ultra-hydrating formulas &amp; we rounded up the best cleansers for your skin this fall!</h4>
      <p>It seems as though we have completely skipped over fall and went straight to winter considering how cold the temperature is outside. So, to get you ready for the cold months ahead, we rounded up the best body washes that will give you a good cleanse while providing <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/best-hair-masks-moisture-dry-strands-3795412/">maximum moisture</a> to dry skin. Whether you have dry, sensitive or irritated skin, there’s a body wash for everyone, which you can see when you click through the gallery above.</p>
      <p>One of our favorite new cleansers is the <b>Dove Relaxing Lavender Body Wash</b> which is perfect for relieving stress. The relaxing sulfate-free lavender body wash is formulated with microbiome gentle cleansers that cleanse skin while providing moisture.</p>
      <p>Another amazing new product is the <b>goop Beauty G.DAY Ginger + Ashwagandha Energy Body Wash</b>. This plant-based body wash is formulated with ginger, ashwagandha, Japanese shiso leaf, Indian black pepper oil, and pink peppercorn berries to energize your body while giving you a deep clean, so you feel ready to take on the day after a good wash.</p>
      <p>If you have super dry or eczema-prone skin, look no further than the <b>SKINFIX Eczema+ Foaming Oil Body Wash</b>. This sulfate-free body wash is perfect for dry, irritated skin as it is super gentle while providing a deep clean and hydration.</p>
      <p>A body wash that is super overrated and often gets looked over is castile soap and one of our favorites is the <b>Dr. Natural Pure-Castile Liquid Soap</b>. This natural almond castile soap is formulated with coconut oil, olive oil, hemp seed oil, natural almond oil blend and organic shea butter to clean the skin while also keeping it super moisturized.</p>
