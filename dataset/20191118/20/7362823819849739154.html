      <h1>Why Christian Bale turned down fourth ‘Batman’ film</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/christian-bale">Christian Bale</a> just revealed a shocking tidbit about hanging up his Batman cape.</p>
      <p>The Academy Award-winning actor took on the role as the caped crusader in three films known to fans as the “Dark Knight” trilogy -- 2005's “Batman Begins,” “The Dark Knight” in 2008 and “The Dark Knight Rises” in 2012.</p>
      <p>He said that he decided against doing another iteration simply out of respect for the director of the trilogy, Christopher Nolan, and the vision set for the franchise moving forward.</p>

      <p>“When they came [to us after ‘Batman Begins’] and said, ‘You want to go make another?’ It was fantastic, but we still said: ‘This is it. We will not get another opportunity,’” Bale, 45, told The <a href="http://torontosun.com/entertainment/movies/pure-bloody-excitement-christian-bale-puts-pedal-to-the-metal-in-ford-v-ferrari">Toronto Sun</a>. “Then they came and they said, ‘OK, let’s do the third one.’ Chris had always said to me that if we were fortunate to be able to make three we would stop. ‘Let’s walk away after that,’ he said.”</p>

      <p>Said Bale: “when they inevitably came to us and said, ‘How about a No. 4?’ I said, ‘No. We have to stick to Chris’ dream, which was always to, hopefully, do a trilogy. Let’s not stretch too far and become overindulgent and go for a fourth.”</p>
