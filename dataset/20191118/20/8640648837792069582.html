      <p>The matches will air Jan. 7 to 9, with additional contests Jan. 10 and Jan. 14 to 16 if necessary.</p>
      <p>So far, Holzhauer’s winnings total $2,712,216.</p>
      <p>Jennings’ record 74-game winning streak earned him $3,370,700.</p>
      <p>Rutter, whose total winnings have reached $4,688,436, has never lost a game of “Jeopardy!” to a human opponent.</p>
