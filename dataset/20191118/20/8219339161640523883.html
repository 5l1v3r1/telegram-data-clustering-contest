      <h1>iFixit’s full 16-inch MacBook Pro teardown highlights new thermal system, improved speakers, Magic Keyboard, more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:47:10+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>iFixit did an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/15/ifixit-cracking-open-the-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-to-check-out-new-magic-keyboard/">initial teardown of the scissor switch Magic Keyboard</a> that comes with the 16-inch MacBook Pro last weekend and now they’ve given Apple’s latest notebook a full inspection. Follow along for a look at the new and improved thermal system, six-speaker system, Magic Keyboard details, and more.</p>
      <p>iFixit noted in its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/15/ifixit-cracking-open-the-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-to-check-out-new-magic-keyboard/">initial peek inside the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> that the Magic Keyboard looked like it should solve the woes that the butterfly keyboard brought to users over the last several years. We also got a sneak peek at the inside of the rest of the machine.</p>
      <p>Now that <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106">iFixit has completed its full teardown</a>, we know how Apple evolved its thermal system for improved venting and the ability to push 28% more air to dissipate heat more effectively.</p>
      <blockquote>Pardon us while we vent for a minute. Stacked atop its slightly-older sibling (the 15-inch 2019 model), the new MacBook Pro has some noticeably larger exhaust holes.<br/><br/>That combined with these new fans, which feature bigger impeller blades, pushes 28% more air through the new Pro.</blockquote>

      <p>As iFixit previously shared, the Magic Keyboard is almost exactly the same as the stand-alone Magic Keyboard, except for the components being slightly thinner. Another positive sign for long-term reliability and ease of cleaning, the Magic Keyboard doesn’t have a silicone membrane like the more recent butterfly keyboard was revised to include.</p>
      <blockquote>There’s slightly less space surrounding these new keys, and pundits will celebrate those reconfigured arrow keys—but everything else looks nigh identical.<br/><br/>News flash: there’s not even a dust-proofing membrane on these new switches. We’re inclined to take this as a very good sign. (It means we can finally eat Doritos during teardowns again.)</blockquote>

      <p>However, a disappointing find for repairability is the fact that the keyboard frame is riveted in place.</p>
      <blockquote>Nooooo! Once again, the keyboard assembly is riveted down. Though the switches are likely less vulnerable to crumbly assailants, the keyboard itself isn’t any more repairable than the Butterfly boards.</blockquote>
      <p>iFixit also shared a look at the new speaker system and three-mic setup found in the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>

      <p>While the 16-inch MacBook Pro brings a variety of solid improvements, to no surprise it continues to fail iFixit’s repairability standards earning a 1 out of 10 for that metric.</p>
      <p>On the bright side, it does still feature an easily replaceable trackpad and hey, we’ve got a reliable keyboard again!</p>
