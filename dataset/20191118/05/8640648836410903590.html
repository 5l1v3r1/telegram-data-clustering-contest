      <h1>LETTER: On the infamous quid pro quo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Dandrea Henderson</a></address>
      <p>Quid pro quo defined is “a favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something.”</p>
      <p>Try this one. Democrats to whistleblower: Give us testimony against the evil President Donald Trump, and we will set up a GoFundMe account for you worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Well, so far it has $227,000.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>
      <p>If you are a true Trump hater, those who do not send money to the poor whistleblower are Trump enablers. Christine Blasey Ford worked this scam to the tune of $850,000.</p>
      <p>Go ahead. Send a few bucks for the cause. Be a true patriot.</p>
