      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): <a href="http://theedgemarkets.com/">theedgemarkets.com</a> has highlighted eight stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. All right stocks displayed negative momentum.</p>
      <p>The stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>BTM Resources Bhd – unchanged at 19 sen</p>
      <p>GDB Holdings Bhd – up 3sen to 46.5 sen</p>
      <p>JHM Consolidation Bhd – up 4 sen to RM1.45</p>
      <p>Gagasan Nadi Cergas Bhd – up 1.5 sen to 28 sen</p>
      <p>P.A. Resources Bhd – up 0.5 sen to 6.5 sen</p>
      <p>P.I.E. Industrial Bhd – up 2 sen to RM1.50</p>
      <p>Rohas Tecnic Bhd – up 3.5 sen to 73.5 sen</p>
      <p>Thong Guan Industries Bhd – up 14 sen to RM3.13</p>
      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
