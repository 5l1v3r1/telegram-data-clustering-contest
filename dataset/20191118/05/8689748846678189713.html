      <h1>Pope Skinny Believes The Award Shatta Wale Gifted Stonebwoy Has A Hidden Motive</h1>

      <p>One of the highlights of the 2019 4Syte Music Video Awards was when Shatta Wale gifted his Most Popular Song award to his former rival, Stonebwoy.</p>
      <p>His move has widely been applauded because it goes a long way to foster the cordial relationship they have established.</p>
      <p>Stonebwoy was also impressed with the gesture as he also got down from the stage to hug Shatta Wale when he was performing.</p>
      <p>This excited the audience and the internet is still talking about it. However, rapper Pope Skinny is desperately reading between the lines of that harmless gesture.</p>
      <p>To him, there could be a hidden agenda behind Wale’s move and has therefore (well, subtly) warned Stonebwoy to be careful whiles addressing Blade and Bone, two Militants who were sacked by Wale.</p>
      <p>Pope Skinny wrote;</p>
      <p>He wrote:</p>
      <p>“Success delayed is not success denied. Blade and Bone, I wish you guys well. Very soon Good over Evil and Stone go join you guys. May God grant us long life Itz a movie. The world go watch am live.”</p>
