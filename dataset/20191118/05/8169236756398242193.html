        <b>Manchester City are reportedly interested in signing RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano in January. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been a key player for the Bundesliga side since joining them from Red Bull Salzburg in 2017. So far, Upamecano has made 86 appearances for Leipzig, scoring three goals.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6498787-exclusive-man-city-consider-january-bid-for-rb-leipzig-defender-dayot-upamecano">90min</a>, Manchester City are considering a bid to sign the Frenchman in January. Pep Guardiola’s side are without their star defender Aymeric Laporte for a few months which leaves them with John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi as their only recognisable centre-backs. Fernandinho has had to play in the heart of defence and even though he has done fairly well, hasn’t had the kind of impact Laporte did.</p>
      <p>City do need a defender in January and Upamecano would be a fine addition. He has been doing pretty well at Leipzig and is someone to watch out for in the future.</p>
      <p>Manchester City aren’t the only side interested in signing Upamecano. The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10194307/arsenal-upamecano-40million-offer-rb-leipzig/">Sun</a> claimed some weeks back that Arsenal were also keen on landing the 21-year-old centre-back who would be available for £40 million.</p>
