      <p>NIGERIA’S Super Eagles continued their good run in the 2021 AFCON Qualifier after a brace from Lille of France striker Victor Osimhen propelled the Eagles to a 4-2 win at the Setsoto Stadium in Maseru.</p>
      <p>Coach Gernot Rohr made some changes to the starting line-up that beat Benin Republic in Uyo, with Moses Simon and Chidozie Awaziem replacing Samuel Kalu and Jamilu Collins.</p>
      <p>According to allnigeriasoccer.com, the home team Lesotho took the lead against the run of play when Masoabi Nkoto took advantage of some sloppy defending from Nigeria to put the hosts ahead in the 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>Fifteen minutes after Lesotho took the lead, Nigeria levelled the score when Osimhen set up Alex Iwobi who slotted home from close range.</p>
      <p>Samuel Chukwueze and Osimhen partnership tormented Lesotho and they combined with Moses Simon, who tested goalkeeper Ntsane Lichaba with a ferocious drive from a free-kick.</p>

      <p>On the 36th minute, Osimhen again found space to send a lob to Chukwueze who beat Lichaba with a good header.</p>
      <p>The Lille striker was proving difficult to handle for The Crocodiles, as he threatened again after the break when he rattled the cross bar with a shot.</p>
      <p>He then got his first goal goal deep into the game when Ola Aina broke free from the right flank to play him in for a neat finish and take the tally to 3-1.</p>
      <p>Osimhen made it 4-1 in the 84th minute when impressive second half substitute Ramon Azeez shrugged off his marker to find the long-limbed front man who lobbed the ball over on-rushing Lichaba to grab his brace as Nigeria looked all but set to close out 2019 in style.</p>
      <p>But there was still time for the charitable Eagles to gift Lesotho another goal deep into stoppage time, Chidozie Awaziem putting through his own net to end the game 4-2 in favour of the Nigerian team.</p>
