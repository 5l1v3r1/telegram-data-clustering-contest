      <p><b>FRESNO, Calif — </b>At least nine people were shot Sunday at a party in Fresno in what appears to be a “mass casualty shooting,” police said.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place about 6 p.m. on the city’s southeast side, Fresno police Lt. Bill Dooley said.</p>
      <p>There was a party in the backyard of a home to watch a football game when the shooting suspects sneaked in and fired into the crowd, Dooley said.</p>
      <p>At least nine people were shot, with several people being found dead in the backyard, he told the Fresno Bee and the KSEE/KGPE TV stations.</p>
      <p>Authorities have not released a total for the number of people killed.</p>
      <p>“What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard,” Dooley said. “Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.”</p>
      <p>The Bee reported that neighbors, who declined to be named for safety reasons, said they heard multiple gunshots.</p>
      <p>Others were taken to Community Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and some are in critical but stable condition, the TV stations reported.</p>
      <p>No suspect is in custody.</p>
      <p>It was at least the second fatal gun attack Sunday in southeast Fresno, the Bee reported. A man in his 20s was shot to death early Sunday at a home in another part of the city. Police have not said whether the incidents could be connected</p>
