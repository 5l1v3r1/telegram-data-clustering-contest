      <h1>I Can’t Stop Dramatically Aww’ing Over Stormi Webster Dressed Up As A Lil’ Travis Scott</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:25:44+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:25</time> by <a rel="author">By Steffanie Tan</a></address>
      <p>It’s Monday – correction, it’s late Monday arvo. It’s time for a mental pick up. I, for one, needed<i> </i>a mental pick up and nothing else today woke me up more than seeing adorable angel <b>Stormi Webster </b>dressed up as her dad. I don’t care what you think about the Kardashians / Jenners, you surely can’t hate on an adorable child being ADORABLE. You just can’t.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, Papa <b>Travis Scott </b>posted a couple of pictures of his little boo dressed up as him – hair style included. I just – it’s too much for the heart. She looks SO CUTE.</p>
      <p>“Daddy’s hair,” Travis captioned the first bunch of pictures. You are absolutely goddamn lying if you don’t swoon over these pictures. She’s so smoll.</p>

      <p>BUT WAIT, there’s more because Travis also posted this absolute beauty.</p>

      <p>I am <i>nowhere </i>near ready for children, but hell – this is giving me baby fever. And by baby fever I mean Cool Aunty Fever – like I’d babysit for a day – a couple of hours, and that’s it.</p>
      <p>Safe to say the pictures have absolutely destroyed the hearts of hundreds in the comments.</p>
      <p>Okay, one last bit of baby content because this still makes me emotional.</p>

      <p>If you haven’t been keeping up, the latest / most talked about piece of goss is <b>Kylie Jenner</b> and <b>Drake </b>apparently ‘hanging out’. I didn’t think much of it at first but the two have reportedly been spotted together a fair few times now so maybe it really is a thing. We’ll find out eventually, we always do.</p>
