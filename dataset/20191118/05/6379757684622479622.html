      <p>The facility described as one of the largest abattoirs in East Africa is set for opening next April.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade, Stella Manyanya paid a visit to the project over the weekend and lauded the ongoing efforts. “The factory will provide direct employment to 300 Tanzanians,” she said, noting that the management has also figured that 2000 other people will benefit from indirect employment linked to the abattoir.</p>
      <p>The abattoir being constructed near the Kenya-Tanzania border in Longido District is expected to be completed in March and inaugurated the following month.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the plant, the officer in-charge of the project, Ambrose Mwangonela stated here that the slaughterhouse being built at the cost of 11bn/- will be able to handle 2000 goats and 500 cattle per day and process the meat for added value, packaging and export.</p>
      <p>The abattoir run by Eliya Overseas Co. will also make use of leftovers from the meat being processed to manufacture other animal feeds for dogs, cats, fish, poultry and swans, along with cattle, he said.</p>
      <p>The slaughterhouse is strategically placed next to the Eworendeke International Livestock Market where cattle, goats, sheep and other animals from all over Tanzania are auctioned. The market attract buyers from neighboring countries.</p>
      <p>The Longido District Commissioner, James Mwaisumbe pointed out that the abattoir stands strategically within the cattle precinct, with Maasai pastoralists living and keeping livestock in the zone.</p>
      <p>Livestock keepers in the Northern Zone often sell their cattle in neighboring Kenya after taking the cattle there using bush footpaths or ’panya’ routes.</p>
      <p>“The Maasai in Longido, Monduli and Ngorongoro District will no longer have to trek long distance riding their cattle to markets as a major livestock market will be right at their doorstep,” the DC enthused.</p>
      <p>The Longido meat processing factory is also expected to generate revenues amounting to over 1 billion/- per year, he said.</p>
      <p>Baraka Solomon, a cattle trader who usually supplies livestock to the International Cattle Auction, laments that dealers face cumbersome bureaucracy in securing control numbers that enable them to pay for relevant permits.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes we are told to apply for control numbers through websites. This regulation does not take into account the fact that the animals are found in remote areas where there is no internet coverage and local residents hardly   own smart phones,” he complained.</p>
      <p>Tanzania ranks third in Africa after Ethiopia and Sudan in numbers of livestock as the country has 21.3 million cattle, 15.2 million goats, 6.4 million sheep and 1.6 million pigs, with 98 percent of these being local breeds belonging to nomadic pastoralists, kept mainly under the traditional grazing system.</p>
      <p>The National Livestock Population Census of 2014 showed that Arusha region tops the country’s bill with a total of 5.8 million domestic fauna, with 1,373,839 cattle, 1,497,361 goats, 1,138,852 sheep, 20,580 pigs and 1,673,702 chicken. Tanzania has 31 regions.</p>
      <p>In Arusha, it is Ngorongoro District which boasts the largest number of livestock. The scantly populated precinct is overwhelmed with 640,000 livestock, mostly cattle and accounts for 35 percent of the cattle population  in the region.</p>
      <p>Traditional pastoralists and agro-pastoralists produce an estimated 1.65 billion litres of milk, equivalent to 70 percent of total dairy production, valued at 701bn/-. The milk sub-sector reportedly provides direct employment to more than 2.2 million people countrywide.</p>
      <p>Statistics show that Tanzania has the second largest livestock population on the African continent after Ethiopia, boasting of 32.5 million heads of cattle, 18.8 million goats and 5.3 million sheep.</p>
