      <h1>Police defend decision to fire warning shots in Kowloon after protesters surround ambulance</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong police have defended the decision of an officer who fired at least two live rounds outside a local university in the early hours of this morning as protesters surrounded an ambulance there.</p>
      <p>A large number of protesters had gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui as a heated battle raged between <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/hong-kong-protesters-clash-with-police-at-key-campus-battleground/">between protesters and police at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>, one that continues today.</p>
      <p>Video circulating online shows more than a hundred people rush towards an ambulance parked at the intersection of Jordan Road and Ferry Street at about 3am. The ambulance was reportedly waiting to take away an injured protester, who had refused to get in because riot officers were inside.</p>
      <p>At least two gunshots ring out, and the protesters quickly disperse.</p>

      <p>In another video from a different angle, protesters can be seen rocking the ambulance back and forth before fleeing after the two shots are heard.</p>
      <p>Yet another video posted online, filmed moments before the gunshots were fired, shows protesters hurling bricks and glass bottles at an officer inside the ambulance.</p>

      <p>According to HK01, a 20-year-old female protester was reportedly <a href="https://www.hk01.com/%E7%AA%81%E7%99%BC/399358/11-17-%E6%B2%B9%E9%BA%BB%E5%9C%B0-%E5%8F%97%E5%82%B7%E5%A5%B3%E7%A4%BA%E5%A8%81%E8%80%85%E8%A2%AB%E6%90%B6%E8%B5%B0-%E8%AD%A6%E5%93%A1%E9%81%87%E8%A5%B2%E9%96%8B%E4%B8%89%E6%A7%8D%E7%A4%BA%E8%AD%A6">refusing to enter the ambulance because there were police officers inside</a>, prompting several demonstrators to surround the vehicle. The outlet reports that the ambulance was called because the woman had fainted and injured her head.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed over social media that a 20-year-old female was arrested at the junction of Nathan Road and Jordan Road for taking part in an unlawful assembly, and that police arranged for the ambulance to take her to the hospital, with two police officers assigned to escort her there.</p>
      <p>Police say that as they escorted the protester to the ambulance, they were surrounded by a mob of demonstrators who helped the arrested protester escape and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HongKongPoliceForce/videos/776994942724845/">trapped the two escort officers inside the ambulance</a>.</p>
      <p>“Rioters hurled rocks and bricks and splashed unknown liquid at the Police officers. One Police officer, in face of grave danger and threat to his life, fired three shots from his service firearm. Initial enquiry shows that the shots did not hit anyone,” the statement read.</p>
