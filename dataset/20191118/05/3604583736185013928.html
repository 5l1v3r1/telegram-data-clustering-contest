      <h1>Bus operators forced to help find patrons another way to get home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Thomson</a></address>
      <p>Three buses were grounded at the Dunkeld races on Saturday after operators were found to be being running vehicles without the necessary authorisation.</p>
      <p>State independent regulator Bus Safety Victoria teamed up with Warrnambool and Hamilton highway patrol unit members and uniform officers to conduct a safety operation targeting buses bringing patrons to the annual meeting which attracted about 12,000 people.</p>
      <p>Acting Director of Bus Safety Lisa Faldon said it was the third year a safety compliance operation was held at the Dunkeld races.</p>
      <p>"Dunkeld is one of many events our team attends around Victoria," she said, adding similar checks are also regularly conducted along the Great Ocean Road.</p>
      <p>"We have a risk-based program of work that demonstrates our commitment to the safety of bus passengers throughout Victoria.</p>
      <p>"Bus operators are coming to expect us at events such as the Dunkeld races. A direct positive result is the reduction in compliance issues detected."</p>
      <p>Ms Faldon said BSV shifted focus each year and considered trends in bus safety incidents and issues across the state.</p>
      <p>"This year we targeted operators without appropriate accreditation, in addition to enforcing the safety management system requirements," she said.</p>
      <p>"Appropriate accreditation indicates required safety standards are being met.</p>
      <p>"It is very pleasing that the majority of operators at this event were doing the right thing. We will be looking to catch people taking shortcuts with safety in the act and hold them accountable."</p>
      <p>During the operation 21 buses were inspected by BSV and the Victoria Police members.</p>
      <p>Two operators were detected operating a commercial bus service and one with operating a non-commercial bus service without the required permission and were subsequently grounded.</p>
      <p>These operators were required to make alternative arrangements for the passengers to get home.</p>
      <p>One driver was given a warning by police for not carrying a driver's licence and driver certification while driving a bus and two drivers were given a warning by police for not carrying driver's certification while driving a bus.</p>
      <p>"Operators detected over the weekend operating outside the law will be followed up by BSV and further action taken," Ms Faldon said.</p>
      <p>"BSV greatly appreciates the participation of Victoria Police in undertaking our compliance activities as it means that we can address a full range of bus safety related issues," she said.</p>
