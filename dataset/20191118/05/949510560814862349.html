      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — New York is taking a look at how its first experiment with early voting went.</p>
      <p>The Democratic-led Legislature is holding a Wednesday hearing on the start of early voting in New York this month.</p>
      <p>New York introduced its new system in a quiet election year, ahead of the 2020 presidential contest.</p>
      <p>New Yorker’s raised concerns about costs, the roll-out of electronic voter rolls and the location of early voting sites.</p>
      <p>The state Board of Elections has said over 256,000 people cast their ballots before Election Day between Oct. 26 and Nov. 3 under early voting.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear just what impact early voting had on turnout. Some experts say early voting could be just another option for voters who otherwise would have turned out on Election Day.</p>
