      <h4>Grab is really living up to its name as a 'lifestyle app' with its latest service: GrabMart</h4>
      <p>Previously available in <a href="https://www.grab.com/th/en/blog/%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88-%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%9D%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%8B%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD/">Thailand</a>, Grab has launched a beta test of the goods delivery service today, 18 November.</p>

      <h4>Using GrabMart, users can order grocery items, fruits, flowers, and health and beauty products</h4>
      <p>In theory, it works a lot like <a href="https://says.com/my/tech/grabfood-has-merged-with-grab-app-so-you-don-t-have-to-switch-between-the-two">GrabFood</a> and utilises both its riders and <a href="https://says.com/my/tech/grabexpress-on-demand-service">GrabExpress</a> riders to have a customer's items delivered on-demand.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/199433/grabmart-malaysia-trial-klang-valley/">LowYat.net</a> reported that some of the stores already available on the service are Guardian, Caring, MyNews, MBG, MPH, BIG Pharmacy, Kiara Supermarket, and Utama Florist.</p>

      <p>You'll then see an icon that says <b>'Mart (Beta)'</b>. <br/><br/>After tapping on it, you'll be shown a list of merchants that are available. <br/><br/>Select your preferred merchant, add items to your cart, then checkout as you would on any e-commerce platform.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/18/grab-grabmart-malaysia-on-demand-pilot/">SoyaCincau</a> reported that the <b>delivery fees vary between RM5 to RM9.</b></p>
