          <p>“<i>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE.</i></p>
          <p>
            <i>Over the past couple of months, I have been on the receiving end of hateful abuse and indeed threats against my life for my outspoken brand of politics.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>I am known for speaking out in defense of ordinary people without fear or favor. This seems to be rubbing some people in high places the wrong way. Regardless, I have done my duty to the people fearlessly and will continue to do so until the Lord calls me home.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>In recent weeks, this vitriol has been getting increasingly worse and over the last few days, I can report that I am a targeted man. I have been consistently followed during the day and at night by a saloon vehicle that I now know with four occupants. Yesterday, these men made an attempt on my life!</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>I have reported this attempt today at Parliament Police Station under OB21/17/11/2019 at 1728HRS. I call upon the Inspector General of Police to immediately launch investigations into this issue and bring those behind these assassination attempts to book.</i>
          </p>
          <p><i>In closing, I will not stop. I shall not stop. Death comes to us all and I know mine will eventually come. I am not afraid of dying for my beliefs and in service to my people. Tialala!</i>” read Babu Owino’s post.</p>
