      <p>Gabriel Barbosa scored the winner from a first-half penalty and then was sent off 17 minutes from time as Flamengo beat Gremio 1-0 away from home on Sunday to take a huge step towards the Brazilian league title.</p>
      <p>PORTO ALEGRE: Gabriel Barbosa scored the winner from a first-half penalty and then was sent off 17 minutes from time as Flamengo beat Gremio 1-0 away from home on Sunday to take a huge step towards the Brazilian league title.</p>
      <p>With closest challengers Palmeiras only drawing 1-1 with Bahia, Flamengo only need three points from their final four games to guarantee the Serie A trophy.</p>

      <p>Sunday's win came thanks to Barbosa, who got his 22nd goal of the league season from a controversial penalty that was awarded after the ball hit Leo Moura's trailing arm as he slid in for a challenge.</p>
      <p>In the second half, the on-loan Inter Milan striker was shown a yellow card for a dissent and then a second in quick succession for sarcastically clapping the referee.</p>
      <p>The win, which takes Flamengo's unbeaten streak to 25 games, means Flamengo have 81 points from 34 games, while Palmeiras have 68 from 33.</p>
      <p>Flamengo's next match is the final of the Copa Libertadores next Saturday against Argentina's River Plate in Peru.</p>
