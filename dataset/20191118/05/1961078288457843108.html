      <p>Four people were fatally shot and six others wounded after at least one gunman opened fire on a backyard party in Fresno, Calif., on Sunday, then fled, the authorities said.</p>
      <p>No suspects had been identified as of early Monday morning, and the police said they were collecting statements from witnesses and running shell casings through a national database. The motive and number of assailants was unknown.</p>
      <p>About 35 friends and family members were watching a football game in the backyard when an unknown number of gunmen opened fire into the crowd, said Michael Reid, a deputy chief of the Fresno Police Department. The authorities received reports of the shooting around 8 p.m. local time.</p>

      <p>Mr. Reid said all 10 of the victims were Asian men between 25 and 30 years old, and added that several children were at the party.</p>
      <p>“Thank God that no kids were hurt,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Reid said three of the men died in the yard, and one died after being taken to a nearby hospital. Six others were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, he said.</p>
      <p>As of Monday morning, the police had not made any arrests in connection with the shooting. The police said they did not know what might have motivated the attack.</p>
      <p>“This is senseless violence,” Mr. Reid said. “We’re going to do everything we can to find out who the perpetrators are and bring them to justice.”</p>
      <p>Detectives were “canvassing the area searching for witnesses and anyone with surveillance cameras,” Lt. Bill Dooley of the Fresno Police Department said.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred on the 5300 block of East Lamona Avenue, just south of the Fresno Yosemite International Airport.</p>
      <p>Videos posted on social media showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street lined with residential homes.</p>
      <p>Fresno, a sprawling city of more than 500,000 people, is surrounded by vast expanses of almond and fruit trees. It is about 175 miles southeast of Sacramento.</p>
      <p>California, which has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, has seen a rash of mass shootings in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a 16-year-old student killed two of his classmates and wounded three others in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/us/school-shooting-santa-clarita.html?module=inline">a shooting at a high school</a> in Santa Clarita, Calif.</p>
      <p>Two shootings at separate Halloween parties, one in a San Francisco suburb and another in Long Beach, south of Los Angeles, killed a total of eight people.</p>
      <p>The shooting at an Airbnb rental in Orinda, the San Francisco suburb, appeared to involve rival gangs, David Livingston, the sheriff of Contra Costa County, said at a news briefing Friday. A total of 10 people were shot in what the sheriff called a “blood bath.”</p>
