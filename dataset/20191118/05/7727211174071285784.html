      <h2>The idea is one of three options being considered for the famous market</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lorna-hughes/" target="_blank">Lorna Hughes</a></address>
      <p>These images show how Birkenhead could be transformed over the next decade - including a new <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/inside-birkenhead-market-what-traders-14364721">Birkenhead Market</a> on the site of the old M&amp;S store.</p>
      <p>The idea is one of three options being considered for the famous market as a masterplan for the town centre takes shape.</p>
      <p>A second option would see the market moved to where B&amp;M is now, while the third would involve building a new market on the current site.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/birkenhead-could-look-very-different-15469525">The Wirral Growth Company</a>, a partnership between the council and urban regeneration specialists Muse Developments, put the latest ideas on display in a pop-up shop at the Pyramids during the latest round of a public consultation.</p>

      <p>The emerging masterplan includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Five phases spanning eight years.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The proposed demolition of Milton Pavement and a revitalised market in years one and two, plus an upgraded bus station and new civic and commercial offices.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Future years would include the demolition of the current market building - if it moves - a new leisure/commercial block and Grade A commercial office buildings.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Plans for new residential neighbourhoods to the north and south of Conway Park Station in later years, plus a hotel and a new leisure centre to replace Europa Pools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mike Horner, development director of Muse Developments, told the ECHO: “This is round two of the consultation. We did the first round back in May and June.</p>

      <p>“It’s all ideas at the moment. It’s a long term plan, it’s a very exciting vision for Birkenhead but it won’t happen overnight. These projects never do, but we want to have a plan to work to and we’re determined to get this right.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to get the feedback of people who live and work in the area.</p>
      <p>“This month we have been showing an emerging masterplan for Birkenhead town centre and getting the views and thoughts of people through a number of events, the pop-up unit in the Pyramids and engaging with local people.</p>

      <p>“We have had sessions with market traders and we’re trying to get around and engage with as many key stakeholders as we can, getting their thoughts on what they like and don’t like.</p>
      <p>“When we collate the feedback, which we will do during the course of December, then early next year we’ll start to refine the masterplan on the back of that.</p>
      <p>“We‘ll then work with the council towards a planning application some time towards the summer of next year.”</p>
      <p>The latest update on the Wirral Growth Company’s website said of the market plans: “The first option is to move the market to the old Marks &amp; Spencer unit, which will ensure continuity of trade for stallholders and maintain its position at the heart of the town centre.</p>
      <p>“A second option is for the market to be housed in a new building on the site of the existing market.</p>
      <p>“The third option is for the market to be located on the existing site of B&amp;amp;M. Whichever option is chosen, it will re-vitalise the market and bring it back to being a place the Wirral community can be proud of and want to visit.”</p>
      <p>On plans for a new leisure centre, it said: “A modern and more energy-efficient leisure centre is proposed close to Conway Park station and existing homes to make sure it is sustainable. This would be delivered before any work on the existing leisure centre.”</p>
      <p>The Wirral Growth Company is a 10-year plan that began in March last year. Birkenhead town centre is one of the first projects, with others including schemes in Bebington, Bromborough and Moreton.</p>
      <p>Birkenhead Market traders’ chairman Greg McTigue, who runs Wirral Mobility, said: “We are watching the developments with interest and looking towards the day when we have a market which is fit for purpose, which of course the current one isn’t.</p>
      <p>“I like the M&amp;S idea because of the location, at the moment we are peripheral to everything.</p>
      <p>"It’s novel and people could come in on two levels, from the ground level and from the Pyramids. We have to look at what’s going to happen around it and whether there’s the square footage to contain the businesses.”</p>
      <p>The latest stage of the consultation will continue until the end of this month.</p>
