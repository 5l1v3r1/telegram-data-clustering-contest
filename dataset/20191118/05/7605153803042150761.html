        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 18 – The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has defended its decision to revoke a recognition agreement with the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT).</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement, Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia explained that the process followed was within the law.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>She further pointed out that the parties involved still have the opportunity for conciliation and ultimately judicial adjudication.</p>
      <p>“This process is succinctly provided for by the law. Accordingly, the narrative being advanced that the Commission intends to kill any union is not only false but also misleading,” she said.</p>
      <p>She also indicated that for there to be a recognition agreement, there are minimum requirements that a union must have and in the event that is not the case, the commission will continue remitting their dues.</p>
      <p>“TSC recognizes teachers’ unions as key stakeholders in the teaching service and the critical role they play in representing teachers’ issues. In its engagement with the unions, TSC operates strictly within the legal provisions that guide such a relationship,” she stated following uproar sparked by its decision against KNUT.</p>
      <p>TSC has already issued a two months’ notice to the KNUT on its intention to revoke their Recognition Agreement.</p>
      <p>According to Macharia, the agreement which was signed 51 years ago will be revoked on grounds that the Union’s membership numbers are below the required simple majority.</p>
      <p>“Pursuant to the provisions of clause 2 of the Recognition Agreement existing between the Teachers Service Commission and the Kenya National Union of Teachers and section 4 (1) of the Labour Relations Act, 2007, the commission hereby issues a two months notice to KNUT to terminate and/revoke the Recognition Agreement dated 15th May, 1968 on the following grounds,” part of the letter stated.</p>
      <p>“The Kenya National Union of Teachers does not have the simple majority of unionisable employees under the employment of the Teachers Service Commission as at November 4, 2019.”</p>
      <p>Should TSC terminate its recognition agreement with KNUT, it would mean the union can no longer bargain on behalf of teachers.</p>
      <p>“An employer, including an employer in the public sector, shall recognise a trade union for purposes of collective bargaining if that trade union represents the simple majority of unionisable employees,” reads Section 54(1) of the Labour Relations Act 2007.</p>
      <p>In the notice to KNUT, TSC says it has already written to the National Labour Board to have the recognition agreement terminated.</p>
      <p>“Take notice that in view of Section 54(5) of the Labour Relations Act, the Commission has simultaneously made the requisite application to the National Labour Board,” adds the letter.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Commission formally terminated the contract of KNUT Secretary General Wilson Sossion as a teacher.</p>
