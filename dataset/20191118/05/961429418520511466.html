        <b>A former chief executive of the NHS, Sir Duncan Nichol, is to retire after 56 years working in the health service.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sir Duncan, currently chair of the Countess of Chester Hospital Foundation Trust, has announced he intends to retire in March 2020.</p>
      <p>From 1989 to 1994 he was chief executive of the NHS Management Executive and has been chair at the Countess since 2012. </p>
      <p>His career in the NHS has spanned more than 50 years, after he joined as a graduate trainee in 1963.</p>
      <p>In a statement published this week, Sir Duncan said: “I have spent my whole career dedicated to working in the NHS and had the great pleasure of being involved with the Countess of Chester over many years and particularly closely over the past seven years, where many colleagues have become valued friends.</p>
      <p>“The decision to step down as chairman is due in part to a change in my personal circumstances and I feel that it is the right time for me to move on as I begin a new chapter in my life. I am now looking forward to enjoying my retirement.”</p>
      <p>Susan Gilby, the FT’s chief executive, said: “I would also like to take this opportunity to personally thank Sir Duncan for the invaluable support he has provided to me since I became chief executive in April. His guidance has been crucial as I look to oversee a transformation programme at the trust that puts patient safety at the centre of all we do.”</p>
      <p>The trust has performed reasonably well on finances and the emergency care target in recent years, although it is rated “requires improvement” by the Care Quality Commission, and is involved in an ongoing police investigation over baby deaths.</p>
