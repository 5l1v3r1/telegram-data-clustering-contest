      <p>It was a night of excitement and loads of fun as Stonebwoy and Shatta stole the show, whiles Medikal and local Jesus, Mmebusem took the audience to the roof.</p>
      <p>In attendance were many celebrities and as we all know, they came to slay with their outfits. Also on the red carpet was Gifty Boakye, the alleged girlfriend of Black Stars player, Thomas Partey.</p>
      <p>She was spotted in a red and black stripes dress. Her simple but beautiful outfit did not attract much attention like the cleavage she flaunted.</p>
