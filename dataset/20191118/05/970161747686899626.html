        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emily-atack/">Emily Atack</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adam-thomas/">Adam Thomas</a> were spotted with no worries in the world while filming for an I’m A Celeb skit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emily, 29, and Adam, 31, were ready for what Australia had to give them as they seemed right at home while the contestants are already having the worst time.</p>
      <p>The Inbetweeners star made a few funny faces at the cast and crew because I’m A Celeb is a lot less scary when you get to host the review segment of it.</p>
      <p>The two were dressed like they were on a summer holiday as she sported a black mini dress covered in birds with chunky brown boots.</p>
      <p>Adam, on the other hand, opted for jeans and a long-sleeved patterned shirt as you never know what’s lurking around in the Australian wilderness.</p>
      <p>Emily and Adam – who is best known for his role in Emmerdale – are suited for the roles as hosts of Extra Camp due to their experience on the show previously.</p>

      <p>Emily was the runner up to Harry Redknapp on 2018’s edition of the popular show while Adam finished third in the 2016 edition of I’m A Celeb.</p>

      <p>The two are joined by Joel Dommett who is there for comedic relief when things get rough.</p>
      <p>This year, Ant McPartlin returned to co-host the show with Dec Donnelly after Holly Willoughby filled in his space last year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Monday saw the launch of the survival series and what better way to do it than with a lot of laughs.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec kicked off I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-dec-open-im-celebrity-hilarious-prince-andrew-sweat-dig-11172692/">making a dig at Prince Andrew</a> and fans are thrilled to have the pair back.</p>
      <p>‘Ten celebrities, all of them very nervous, all of them sweating,’ Ant said.</p>
      <p>‘Presuming they can sweat, not everyone can,’ Dec added with a cheeky smirk on his face.</p>
      <p>The joke comes in reference to Saturday night’s interview with Prince Andrew on Newsnight, in which the royal family member and close friend of Jeffrey Epstein claimed that he couldn’t have been the man to sleep with Virginia Giuffre, an underage girl, because the man she described was sweaty whereas he ‘couldn’t sweat.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He claimed: ‘I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.’</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply… it was almost impossible for me to sweat.’</p>
