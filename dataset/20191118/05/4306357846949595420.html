      <h3>Roberto Firmino has vowed to keep working hard and improving for Liverpool FC this season and beyond.</h3>
      <p>The Brazil international is widely considered to be one of the Reds’ key attacking players and he has been a regular fixture in the first team under Jurgen Klopp this season.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has scored three goals and made three assists in 12 Premier League appearances for Liverpool FC so far this season to help Klopp’s team build an eight-point lead at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Along with Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, Firmino is recognised as a key part of Liverpool FC’s potent attack.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian has also notched up three assists in four Champions League games for the Merseyside outfit so far this season.</p>
      <p>Firmino has now underlined his desire to keep improving and stepping his game up for the Merseyside club as he looks to help them win the Premier League title this season.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/373143-roberto-firmino-improvement-trophies-liverpool">interview</a> quoted by Liverpool FC’s website, Firmino said: “I think I improved a lot in every way: physically, tactically, mentally, I learned a bit of every aspect.</p>
      <p>“But I do not want to stop here. I want to keep improving – I always want more, I have big goals, I want to keep winning titles with this club and that is it.”</p>
      <p>The attacking midfielder also went on to underline how important Klopp has been for the Reds in recent years since his appointment back in October 2015.</p>
      <p>He added: “I am never tired of praising Klopp.</p>
      <p>“He has so many good things on and off the pitch. He really helps us on a daily basis, we learn so much from him in every way.</p>
      <p>“He is able to have the team with him. We have been doing things well and learning a lot from him, and we have been showing on the pitch that we can grow more and more each day and do our best.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League next weekend.</p>
