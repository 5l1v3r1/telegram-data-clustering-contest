      <p>(CNN) - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended up 1.4% Monday, the biggest daily gain in two weeks, continuing a slight rebound after last week's losses.</p>
      <p>Although the index closed higher Friday, it slid nearly 4.8% overall last week. That was the Hang Seng's biggest weekly drop since August. The city has been rattled by violent protests that escalated in recent days.</p>
      <p>The local economy has also been hit. The Hong Kong government warned Friday that mass protests<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/15/economy/hong-kong-economy-recession-protests/index.html"> could cause the economy to shrink by 1.3% this year</a>, which would mark the first annual recession since 2009.</p>
      <p>Tencent jumped 3.1%. Bloomberg reported Friday that the Chinese social media and gaming giant was reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/tencent-said-in-talks-to-form-consortium-for-vivendi-s-umg-stake">in talks with investors</a> about a minority stake in Universal Music Group. UMG owner Vivendi <a href="https://www.vivendi.com/en/press/press-releases/vivendi-enters-into-preliminary-negotiations-with-tencent/">first acknowledged in August</a> that it was talking to Tencent about a stake in the business.</p>
      <p>China's Shanghai Composite Index also built on its earlier gains and closed up 0.6%. The People's Bank of China trimmed a key interbank lending rate Monday, two weeks after the central bank <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/investing/asian-market-latest-us-china-trade/index.html">cut another important rate</a>.</p>
      <p>It's another sign that the central bank "is starting to take a more proactive approach" to pushing down borrowing costs to prop up economic growth, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics.</p>
      <p>Monday's move could encourage banks to lower the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/19/investing/china-interest-rate-cut/index.html">Loan Prime Rate</a> on Wednesday, as banks' funding costs are lower, he wrote in a research note. The LPR is the interest rate that banks charge corporate clients for new loans. It's a new lending benchmark that China introduced in August and hopes to gradually replace the existing fixed benchmark lending rate.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the region, markets were relatively muted. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5%. South Korea's Kospi Index, though, slipped nearly 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Investors may be looking for more news on trade. Wall Street's major indexes <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/15/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html">all closed in the green</a> on Friday in part because of US-China trade optimism. Over the weekend, China's Ministry of Commerce said that Chinese and US negotiators had held a "constructive discussion" about a phase one deal.</p>
      <p>SoftBank announced Monday<a href="https://group.softbank/en/corp/set/data/news/press/sb/2019/20191118_01/pdf/20191118_01.pdf"> a plan to merge its unit Z Holdings, formerly Yahoo Japan, with messaging service operator Line Corp</a> in 2020.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings and Line Corp finished up 1.2% and 2.2% each in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>US futures, meanwhile, rose slightly during Asian trading hours on Monday. Futures for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were all up.</p>
