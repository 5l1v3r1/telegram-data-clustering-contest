      <p>Two Safeguard Security employees died on the spot on Sunday after the vehicle they were travelling in crashed into a tree while trying to avoid a head-on collision on a curve in one of the Bulawayo suburbs.</p>
      <p>There are reports that driver of the car tried to overtake another car on a curve while there was oncoming traffic leading to the accident.</p>
      <p>No other person was injured in the accident.</p>
      <p>Safeguard Security staff at the scene declined to comment.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness gave a brief account of the accident to the <a href="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/horror-crash-in-attempt-to-avoid-head-on-2-dead-on-the-spot/">Chronicle</a></p>
      <aside>“From the look of things, the driver could have been speeding. We are told that the accident occurred as he was trying to avoid an oncoming vehicle as he was trying to overtake on the curve. Surprisingly, the tree they rammed into did not even have a scratch. But this accident only points to speeding,”</aside>
      <p>The police appealed to the public to exercise caution on the roads to avoid unnecessary loss of lives.</p>
