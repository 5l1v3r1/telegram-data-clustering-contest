      <h1>Accuser: Jeffrey Epstein's home had cameras "monitoring private moments"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:45:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/" target="_blank">CBSNews</a></address>
      <p>One of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers is providing chilling new insight into his alleged sex trafficking operation.</p>
      <p>Maria Farmer, who is suing the Epstein estate, says cameras inside his Manhattan home were able to observe "private moments." CBS News</p>
      <p>Maria Farmer told "CBS This Morning" that Epstein sexually assaulted her more than 20 years ago. She is now suing the Epstein estate.</p>
      <p>In her first TV interview, Farmer alleges that Epstein had extensive surveillance inside his home, including tiny pinhole cameras.</p>
      <p>Farmer told co-host Anthony Mason that Epstein showed her cameras throughout his house.</p>
      <p>"The main thing he did when I walked in, and I thought was interesting, he showed me where the cameras, the men monitoring everything, were. So, if you're facing the house, there's a window on the right that's barred. That's the media room, is what he called it. And so, there was a door that looked like an invisible door with all this limestone and everything. And you push it, and you go in. And I saw, all the cameras, it was, like, old televisions basically, like, stacked."</p>

      <p>"Monitors?" asked Mason.</p>
      <p>"They were monitors inside this cabinet. And there were men sitting here. And I looked on the cameras, and I saw toilet, toilet, bed, bed, toilet, bed. I'm like, 'I am never gonna use the restroom here and I'm never gonna sleep here,' you know what I mean? It was very obvious that they were, like, monitoring private moments."</p>
      <p>She believes there are tapes - the question is, who has them?Â </p>
