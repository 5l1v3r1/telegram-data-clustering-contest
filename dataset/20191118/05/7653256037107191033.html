      <p>NEW DELHI: Shares of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals rallied over 21 per cent in Monday's session after global brokerage firm <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/CLSA">CLSA</a> upgraded the stock and also raised its target price.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/emkay-global-financial-services-ltd/stocks/companyid-16868.cms">global financial services</a> upgraded the stock to 'Buy' from 'Sell', citing attractive valuations. It also raised FY20-22 EPS by 3 per cent-22 per cent.</p>
      <p>However, the leveraged balance sheet remains a concern, CLSA highlighted.</p>
      <p>“US sales momentum is expected to remain strong whereas India should continue growing above the industry rate. All geographies witnessed YoY growth for the first time in over three years,” CLSA said.</p>
      <p>The drug firm last week reported a consolidated net profit to Rs 255.54 crore for the second quarter ended on September 30. It had reported a net profit of Rs 414 crore in the July-September quarter a year ago.</p>
      <p>The net profit is not comparable to the previous corresponding quarter on account of an exceptional income of Rs 167.18 crore recorded in the second quarter of the previous financial year, the company said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/YES-Securities">YES Securities</a> is also positive on Glenmark Pharma with a 12-month target price of Rs 340.</p>
      <p>“Capital raising in innovative subsidiary is now the most pressing need in our view as management would have put in substantial R&amp;D efforts and investment in the subsidiary Ichnos, totaling $240mn over a 2-year period. Management also indicated that it would not start phase 3 for gXolair without getting a partner on board. We reckon the outcome of all the ongoing partnership talks and stake sale in innovation company would be a bigger trigger for valuation rerating than expectation of a mid-single-digit growth in US and 13-14 per cent rise in domestic sales over next two years,” the brokerage house said.</p>
      <p>The shares of the company closed 21.51 per cent higher at Rs 366 on BSE.</p>
