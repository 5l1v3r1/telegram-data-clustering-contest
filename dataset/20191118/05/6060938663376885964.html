      <h1>#ReleaseTheSnyderCut: Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa and Ben Affleck join fans to request the release of Zack Snyder’s cut of ‘Justice League’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:19:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:19</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>‘Wonder Woman’ star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gal-Gadot">Gal Gadot</a>, '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aquaman">Aquaman</a>' actor <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jason-Momoa">Jason Momoa</a> and former ‘Batman’ actor <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ben-Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> have taken to social media to request Warner Bros. release director Zack Snyder’s cut of ‘Justice League’.</p>
      <p>Snyder, who helmed ‘Man of Steel’, ‘Batman v Superman’, partly directed ‘Justice League’ before leaving the production partway due to the sudden demise of his daughter. As a result, the makers called on ‘Avengers’ director <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Joss-Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> to take over the reins and get the film out in time.</p>
      <p>‘Justice League’ went on to be a disappointment at the box office and seemed to have done little to woo fans. It was only a matter of time before buzz began doing the rounds that there was a ‘Snyder Cut’ of the movie that didn’t see the light of day. For a while now, fans have been asking the makers to release the footage, but it was passed off for the longest time, until now.</p>
      <p>With the film’s leading stars including Ray Porter who has portrayed the character of Darkseid and Ray Fisher who played Cyborg, joining in the campaign to release the cut, it remains to be seen if the studio will announce their plans to do so shortly.</p>
      <p>Months after 'Aquaman' star Jason Momoa revealed that he had seen the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Snyder-Cut">Snyder cut</a> and claimed it was “sick,” Gal took to her Twitter handle to share a photo of her character Diana and simply say, "#ReleaseTheSnyderCut". Actors Ben Affleck and Ray Porter also chimed in agreement.</p>

      <p>This request comes just weeks after some deleted and unseen footage from 'Avengers: Endgame' made its way onto social media sites. The clips that show impressive alternative scenes and endings had many fans taking to social media, wondering why the clips weren't included in the film's narrative.</p>
