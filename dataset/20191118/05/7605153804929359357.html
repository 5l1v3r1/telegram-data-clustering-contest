        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 18 – Champion Carl Flash Tundo is expecting a tough battle from current log leader Baldev Chager in the eighth round of the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC) to go down Saturday, November 23 in Eldoret. </b>
      </p>
      <p>‘I’m still in the hunt for the Championship and looking forward to yet another great fight with Baldev,” Tundo, who finished second in Meru earlier in the month said.</p>
      <p>The KNRC title race is now a two horse race following Manvir Baryan’s accident in Meru.</p>
      <p>Manvir was hospitalised for four days at Aga Khan following a high-speed roll in his Skoda Fabia R5.</p>
      <p>“We still lead the Championship after Meru, so that’s obviously the main focus. We have two two more events to go and we need to see what best to do,” said Chager, adding: “Manvir was also in contention but unfortunately had an accident in Meru so it’s up to to me and Flash Tundo.”</p>

      <p>Chager and Flash Tundo will also fight for the top spot with Meru winner Onkar Rai who gave the VW Polo R5 it’s maiden finish and win after two failed attempts in Mombasa and Nanyuki. Onkar is however out of contention after a member of retirements.</p>
      <p>“I expect Chager to be as competitive as ever given the status of the Championship. We ended up in second position in Meru and we were very happy about that, so two more rallies and let’s see how it goes,,” said Flash Tundo who has one one win this season in Nanyuki.</p>
      <p>Chager has two wins under his belt in Kajiado and, Safari and is aiming for his third in Eldoret.</p>
      <p>Manvir won Mombasa Rally while Onkar has two in Nakuru and Meru.</p>
