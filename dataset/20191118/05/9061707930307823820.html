      <h2>Wrap up warm to usher in the start of the festive season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Moody</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is just around the corner and soon towns and villages across the country will be filled with brightly coloured lights.</p>
      <p>The annual switching on of the festive lights is always an occasion to look forward to as people gather to see the button pressed for the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/christmas">official start of Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>Some places bring in celebrities to turn on the lights, while in others enlist the mayor or another prominent character to flick the switch honour.</p>
      <p>Across East Staffordshire and South Derbyshire, we will see fireworks, performers, fairs and Christmas markets adding to the celebrations as families wrap up warm to brave the cold.</p>
      <p>And we have done a round-up of when towns and villages across the area will be switching on.</p>
      <p>Anyone who would like their lights included in the round-up can email <a href="http://jennifer.moody@reachplc.com/">jennifer.moody@reachplc.com</a>.</p>
