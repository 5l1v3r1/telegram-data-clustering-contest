      <h3>Mateo Kovacic has revealed that Frank Lampard has asked him to shoot more for Chelsea FC this season.</h3>
      <p>The Croatia international has been a regular fixture in the first team this season and has featured in all 12 of Chelsea FC’s Premier League games this term.</p>
      <p>He has notched up one assist in the Premier League for the Blues so far this term and he is yet to score a goal for the west London club.</p>
      <p>Kovacic has not scored a goal for club or country since January 2017 and the 25-year-old will clearly be looking to put that right in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>Now, the midfielder has revealed how Lampard has asked him to shoot more often for Chelsea FC this season as he bids to try and find the net more regularly.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Chelsea FC’s <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/16/kovacic-exclusive-part-one--on-finding-top-form--playing-with-jo">website</a>, Kovacic said: “I never had the pressure to score goals, I was never obsessed because my game is not about goals, but obviously if I want to go to the next step I need to improve it.</p>
      <p>“The coach was the greatest goal-scoring midfielder that ever played. There were many, but he really scored a lot of goals. He [Lampard] tells me always that I need to shoot. Now I am trying more!</p>
      <p>“It’s just a thing of mentality, to try to score, to be aggressive and to have the hunger to score goals.</p>
      <p>“I want to improve that, I’m trying to improve that and I am sure I will get there.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action after the international break when they take on Manchester City at The Etihad on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The Blues are currently in third place in the Premier League table and eight points off top spot after having won all six of their last six games in the top flight.</p>
