      <h1>Elephant named after Osama bin Laden dies following fatal stampede</h1>

      <p>An elephant named after Osama bin Laden has died in captivity after going on a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/elephant-named-after-osama-bin-laden-goes-on-rampage-killing-five-indian-villagers/">wild stampede that killed five villagers</a> in India.</p>
      <p>The rogue animal — nicknamed “Laden” — died early Sunday in Assam’s Orang National Park, where officials planned to teach it to patrol wildlife parks and sanctuaries in the state, according to AFP.</p>
      <p>The beast killed five people, including three women, during a terror-filled 24 hours through Goalpara district in October. It had been tracked for days by forestry officers and was tranquilized last week.</p>
      <p>On Sunday morning <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/rogue-elephant-dies-captivity-killing-villagers-100507946.html">he was found dead</a>.</p>
      <p>“The animal was behaving as normal. It was, however, kept with its legs tied so that it couldn’t escape,” a park ranger, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP.</p>
      <p>The cause of death was unclear, but a senior official said the state government had sent a team of veterinarians to carry out an autopsy.</p>
      <p>About 2,300 people have been killed by elephants in India in the last five years, while 700 elephants have been killed since 2011, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Elephants frequently migrate into Goalpara, resulting in many fatal encounters with people amid rampant deforestation.</p>
      <p>Some elephants have been poisoned or shot by locals, while others have died on electric fences or on railroads cutting through migration routes.</p>
