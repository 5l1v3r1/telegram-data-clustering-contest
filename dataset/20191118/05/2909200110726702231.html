      <p>Last year, an article on Entrepreneur.com brought the question of women working with fellow women to the fore by suggesting many women tend to avoid working with their fellow women for many reasons, the main one being perceived incivility.</p>
      <p>There are so many forms incivility can take in the workplace, and while men report experiencing incivility perpetrated by women and men at the same rate, women say that they experience incivility from their own sex more often. Across three studies focused on gender and workplace incivility, researchers found that women were 5 to 9 percent more likely to experience incivility from other women than from men, according to Marcus Butts, an associate professor in the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University, who co-authored that research.</p>
      <p>People tend to compare themselves to others who are similar to them in terms of demographics. As a result, women tend to be hyper-aware of the actions of other women, compared to the actions of their male counterparts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>92% women disapprove of women bosses/supervisors</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over 90 percent of hundreds of women sampled in a social media survey strongly opposed working under a female boss but would rather work with a male boss.</p>
      <p>92% of the women said if they had their way, they would never have to work under a female boss or supervisor ever in their lives.</p>
      <p>Out of this, only 3 percent of the women polled said they wouldn’t mind working under a female, but if only they had no option.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The following a synopsis of women’s real life experiences and views on why they prefer males bosses but never women:</b>
      </p>
      <p>“When I started working at Airtel my first boss was a woman at that time she was not married and didn’t have kids. There was a day I got a call from my son’s school that he was hurt and had being rushed to the hospital, she wasn’t at work yet so my then HR told me to go to the hospital and let him know how my son is doing. I went to the hospital, my mum was also there after staying for like two hours I decided to go back, tell her what happened and then go back to the hospital. When I got back to work this woman asked me if I’m a doctor and that me rushing to the hospital nu what did I go and do there. I cried my eyes out, she then told me the two hours I spent at the hospital nu I have to work after I close to cover up. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I called my mom told her to take my son home when he is discharged I will come home later, I could hear my son crying and shouting mummy mummy at the background but there was nothing I could do. My other colleagues were so sad about my situation, my friend oh God bless her decided to stay after work and do my hours for me so I go and take care of my son. Fast forward I got a male boss, herh Fred God bless you wati. He was equally unmarried and didn’t have kids then. I was pregnant, if I say I will tell you the things this male boss of mine did to make me comfortable eh, I can write a book. Making sure my legs are comfortable, making me work less hours, getting a pillow for my back, getting a bus to take me home when I’m not well oh God the list goes on and on and on. Charley male boss’s are the best. Mr Fred Badu Kusi Nyame Nyira wo bebreeee”</p>
      <p>“Male boss all day e’rrday. Ask me why… So I was called for an interview sometime back and amongst the panelists was a Male in the midst of 3 Females. No matter how the man tried to defend and be on my side throughout the interview,the ladies seemed unimpressed, eiiiii. Me naa I knew I wasn’t doing that bad too, I could feel the hatred Bro!”</p>
      <p>“Male boss, female boss will just quench your zeal with all her jealousy and rivalry at heart.”</p>
      <p>“Definitely a male boss. Male bosses tend to give room  for ladies to bring out their best. Personally, I’m yet to meet I wonderful female boss though.”</p>
      <p>“Women, we are our own enemies o. A boss with sense and sensitivity. Most male bosses think they’re entitled to your body and some female bosses are intimidated by some subordinates. So the one who gives me peace of mind”</p>
      <p>“Male ooo..the female ones I HV not got enough diagrams to explain it better…boi A male boss… They treat staff better.”</p>
      <p>“Most female bosses right from the word go, prejudice that they will not receive maximum support and respect, hence they end up abusing power, some go to the extent of abusing staff  verbally, the lists goes on and on…”</p>
      <p>“A male boss will get my 💯 vote 👍👍 With my 19 years working experience, this year has  been the first time working with a Female boss and I’m really enjoying her services equally as the Male bosses I have had.”</p>
      <p>“‘BOTH’ depending on the way we handle their Pros and Cons. Just do your work, follow the principles of the organization and its rules and regulations. Period!”</p>
      <p>“U all say a male boss because u want to be pampered even if u don’t do well. Also, Because female boss sees u as a potential lady who can date her husband at any given opportunity. Anyway, accept a man as your boss in the house also.”</p>
      <p>“I prefer to work with a male boss. Male bosses tend to understand you better than your fellow woman . I once had a male boss who will give you a day or two off upon seeing you going through severe menstrual cramps. I equally experienced a female boss who will see you in pains yet, will walk up to you with instructions on work .. I will love to work with a male boss any day. They are the best.”</p>
      <p>“I went through hell when I was doing my teaching practice. Common primary school head, this woman didn’t give me air to breath. Male boss any day.”</p>
      <p>Male bosses are at times patient with you when you try to explain to them why a task hadn’t been completed. The female bosses are good at insulting so I prefer male bosses I always prefer male bosses even male lectures  to female lecturers. All the female lectures I’ve had turned out to be a pain in the ass.”</p>
      <p>“Male Boss. .. they are more understanding and respect you more… .. but with the female bosses hmmmmm they take more salary than you but still jealous of you because you dress more better than her…”</p>
      <p>“Male boss anytime, anyday. They understand respect for women better. Definitely a male boss, they treat their female staffs better unlike the female boss who feels too big and talk like they own the world because of some small company”</p>
      <p>“I prefer a male boss they don’t have time to complain over unnecessary things  , no drama”</p>
      <p>“I prefer male boss. Ladies the acting drama is too much. Something simple for them to understand, they will be behaving as if dey don’t understand English language. If you dress well more than them they get problem,if u are beautiful more than them u are dead”</p>
      <p>“Male bosses are less dramatic”</p>
      <p>Male boss, just cos they are easy to communicate. But a GH/Nija woman in position and u working under them, is like THE INSECURITIES nu d))so dodo.”</p>
      <p>Both. But male boss be the guy la. A female boss can give u headache one morning erh, u might want to run out of the office. Especially if she den the husband fight for house”</p>
      <p>“Me de3 I like male boss wai. Earl Ankrah My No1 boss. Such a sweet boss to work with. Thank u Earl for being my No1 boss. Really miss working with u”</p>
      <p>“I am under the supervision of a great personality. She is the Regional Head at lands Commission and working with her is just awesome.”</p>
      <p>“I had been under the supervision of a woman who made life a living hell for me. It’s more of the personality than the gender. My boss some years ago made working very easier and cool for me. He was a good person.”</p>
      <p>“I will prefer a male boss over a sheboss personally though I have two lady bosses n I love them. There has been improvement n I love that. I have worked with some Male bosses n a few were good, the rest always tried to get into your pants or talk down on you which I don’t appreciate.”</p>
      <p>“After reading all the above comments, I can now define a woman perfectly..#Sunday #confessions from their own mouth”</p>
      <p>“I can’t say anything good about all the female bosses I worked with! I prefer male bosses.”</p>
      <p>“As for the female bosses if you are married and they are not wahala dey for you For me, I will go for a lady boss any day. You know why? They are always looking out for details, and this gives you an opportunity to learn, and do well for your own growth, but the males would just be fine on the face value. E.g. a male boss will only go to an event centre, walk round and is cool with the entire setting, but a lady boss will actually use her finger to check out for dust or dirt on chairs, whether table cloths to be used are washed and neatly ironed, and try to change the setting to give it a better facelift. Women will always be women any where because they like fine things”</p>
      <p>“I prefer Male boss because I have seen and experienced ‘women are their own enemies ‘ It’s  more of a personality thing. I have worked with both gender and i have had good and bad relationship with both. I have also be a boss and most of my staff preferred working with me to working with a male. But personally i will pick a male boss over a female boss.”</p>
      <p>“I prefer Male bosses. They are less dramatic fact is, women cant stand their fellow woman bossing them around.” They are ok with a male boss bossing them even more than a female boss would.This is natural”</p>
      <p>“I like male boss anytime. Female bosses are nauseatingly rude I prefer A male boss oo hw3 a female boss dat won’t even allow u to attend to Ur sick baby, a mother female boss at that ooo., Female bosses will always remind u dat they are the boss.tweaaa”</p>
      <p>“Male boss please. They are more humane and understanding. As for female boss Hmmmm. I prefer a male boss. Male bosses are d best, female  bosses exaggerate everything and too dramatic”.</p>
