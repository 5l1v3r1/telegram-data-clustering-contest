      <p>The Harambee Stars are ‘motivated’ ahead of tonight’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2021 qualifying match against Togo at the Kasarani Stadium.</p>
      <p>Despite off the field wrangles pitting the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) and the principal secretary in the ministry of sports, Kilimi Kaberia, over funding, Stars maintained their focus and managed a point away to Egypt on Thursday in their Group G opener.</p>
      <p>The team left for Alexandria, Egypt without accommodation money from the ministry – risking being thrown out of their hotel.</p>

      <p>But head coach Francis Kimanzi says that they will not be distracted by the off the field issues.</p>
      <p>“I prefer to stay positive because the players are very positive. Any arrangements which might have gone wrong I don’t think they will play a part on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The players are motivated to play on Monday,” the former Mathare United coach said on arrival from Egypt on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Since the match will be played under floodlights, Stars trained twice on Sunday at the match venue with the final practice session taking place at 9pm.</p>
      <p>The visitors, who lost their opening group match at home to Comoros, also had a feel of the pitch.</p>
      <p>Their French coach Claude Le Roy expects tough match against Kenya.</p>

      <p>“Kenya are a very strong team; you cannot get a good result as they did away in Alexandria if you don’t have a good team,” the AFCON winner with Cameroon, Le Roy said.</p>
      <p>Overall, Kenya and Togo have met four times, all in the AFCON qualifiers, with both sides winning twice apiece and drawing once.</p>
