      <p>It's the little note that made it through the flames and has set social media on fire - internationally!</p>
      <p>Urunga RFS Deputy Captain Kale Hardie-Porter and his team had spent hours protecting a house in the forest west of Taylors Arm on November 8, and as they left, he scrawled a cheeky note acknowledging that they'd raided the fridge.</p>
      <p>"We had fought so hard and I thought I'd like to know if the house survived, so I left the note hoping they would get in touch and let us know if it did," Kale said.</p>
      <p>"They were such hellish conditions and it was a random thought ... when I saw Paul's Facebook post a few days later it was an instant reaction of joy that the house had survived!</p>
      <p>"The post had already been shared a bit but then things escalated and it went berserk - I had messages on my phone from news outlets around the world including the New York Times."</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old environmental planner, who lives at Raleigh, is still shaking his head about it all a week later.</p>
      <p>"It was such a big day, the media circus has been bizarre but it has also been very humbling to see how much joy this brought to so many people.</p>
      <p>"It has really made people think about the work that firefighters do, every day ... that recognition has been heartwarming."</p>
      <p>Kale chuckles at the mention of the 'milk' debt.</p>
      <p>"We'd gone up this narrow gravel road to have a look and found this little wooden cottage on a hill amidst dense vegetation. We thought we'd have time to assess to see if it was defendable ... but then the wind changed and there were three fire fronts coming towards us; suddenly the safest thing to do was to bunker down.</p>
      <p>"It was a bit of a tight situation. And when the fire impacted, the shed just erupted into flames - I never thought that was possible! We had three lines out and we were protecting the house as best we could - the adrenaline was pumping and it was hard to see.</p>
      <p>"We sheltered on the verandah from the heat. The power was off and the chances of the house surviving seemed pretty low. We hadn't eaten all day and our energy was getting low so when I saw the fridge I thought I'd see if there was anything in it - that's when we drank the milk and ate some cheese and peanut butter."</p>
      <p>The crew made their escape, safely, at 7.30pm.</p>

      <p>And it was not until Saturday afternoon when the owner Paul Sekfy made his way up the hill, having sheltered in Macksville overnight and driven through the fire grounds from Taylors Arm.</p>
      <p>"Everything was blackened on the way out, I saw three houses were already gone - I was fearing the worst, especially when I saw the two sheds burnt - and then, "Holy ****, there it was on the top of the hill!" Paul said.</p>
      <p>"It was like a halo around the house, where they had defended it - and then I saw the note ... I rang Denise (Olsen) and our emotions completely overflowed.</p>
      <p>"Getting out had been so traumatic for her, she left so quickly with not much except the animals, and I was stressing as I flew over it all coming back from Sydney.</p>
      <p>"I posted it spontaneously with a message saying 'You guys rock!' - and with all the bush burnt, the mobile phone coverage actually worked!</p>
      <p>"By Monday Kale had responded - they were so happy to know their efforts meant something. Those guys are amazing ... and then the post went viral and I'm here at the Jabiru Motel in Nambucca Heads (we can't go home yet, it is not livable) and there are these calls coming in from all around the world.</p>
      <p>"It was incredible - it really shone a light on our part of the world, people know we are here, we are not forgotten and it shows how strong and resilient our community is.</p>
      <p>"Here is a bit of paper that spoke to all humanity!"</p>

      <p>It will be quite a while before Paul and Denise can return to their little cabin but in the short term, they are looking forward to catching up with Kale and the crew (Tash Collins, Craig Oats and Gary Sills) for a few beers and a truly heartfelt thank you.</p>
      <p>And in a special final message, Kale thanked his employers at Geolink for their support.</p>
      <p>"It is so important that businesses allow their staff to take time off to do this - it is vital that volunteers know they are supported by their employers."</p>
