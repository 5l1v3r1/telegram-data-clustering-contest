      <h1>Quad-camera Vivo S1 Pro is coming to Malaysia very soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:29+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>Vivo Malaysia is introducing yet another quad-camera smartphone and it’s the Vivo S1 Pro. It looks similar to the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/12/vivo-s5-quad-camera-bump-weird/">Vivo S5</a> that was introduced in China that comes with a cube camera bump that’s rotated at a 45-degree angle.</p>
      <p>So far we don’t have any details of its local availability and pricing just yet, but the Vivo S1 Pro is already available for blind pre-order in Indonesia. According to the <a href="https://vivosmartphone.id/S1-pro">product page</a>, the device comes with a 6.38″ Super AMOLED Full HD+ display and it runs on a Snapdragon 665 processor. In Indonesia, the device is configured with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage which is expandable via a microSD card.</p>

      <p>For taking pictures, the S1 Pro gets a quad-camera array that features a 48MP main camera that uses Samsung’s GM1 sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera. The other two cameras offer macro and bokeh effects. If you need to take a selfie, there’s a 32MP front camera that’s housed in a tiny notch.</p>

      <p>Powering the Vivo S1 Pro is a rather large 4,500mAh battery that supports Vivo’s Dual-Engine fast charging via USB-C. The device is expected to run on Android 9 Pie with FunTouch OS skin on top. For instant unlocking, the device also comes with an in-display fingerprint sensor that’s called “Screen Touch ID” in Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The S1 Pro is seen as a higher-spec version of the current <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/07/24/vivo-s1-malaysia-official-launch/">Vivo S1</a> that was introduced in Malaysia in July 2019. The standard S1 was launched at RM1,099 and it comes with 6GB RAM + 128GB storage.</p>

      <p>On SIRIM, the Vivo S1 Pro with the device model Vivo 1920 has already passed the certification but there’s also another model that’s listed with the model number Vivo 1919. This could be a cheaper alternative and we will expect to hear more from Vivo in the coming weeks.</p>
