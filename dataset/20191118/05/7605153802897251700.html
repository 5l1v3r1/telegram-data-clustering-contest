        <b>SAO PAULO, Brazil, Nov 18 – World champion Lewis Hamilton was handed a five second penalty by the race stewards for causing an accident.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton was deemed by the stewards to be predominantly at fault for sending Albon into a spin when trying to overtake the Red Bull driver for P2 in the final, chaotic stages of the Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>The decision means that Hamilton has dropped from P3 to P7 and McLaren’s Sainz now completes the podium alongside race winner Max Verstappen and Pierre Gasly.</p>
      <p>Hamilton has also had two penalty points added to license.</p>
