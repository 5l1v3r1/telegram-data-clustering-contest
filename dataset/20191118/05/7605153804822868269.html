        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 18 – Chelsea are reportedly competing with Neymar’s former employers Barcelona to sign the Brazilian star from Paris Saint-Germain.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Neymar was a huge hit with the Catalan giants, helping them win two La Liga titles and the Champions League before he completed a world-record move to Paris.</p>
      <p>However the move has not gone according to plan in the Brazilian’s eyes and he has been pining for a return to the Nou Camp over the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>It looked like he may get his wish in the summer but the two European powerhouses could not agree a deal and Neymar ended up staying in France, much to his annoyance.</p>
      <p>There has been talk of a deal being resurrected at some point in the future, and when quizzed about the situation, Barca sporting directot Eric Abidal refused to close the door on the move.</p>
      <p>There is a lot to sort out if the 27-year-old is to return to Barca, but as long as he is playing well and at the top of his game, Abidal says they will be interested.</p>
      <p>“A top player, who has a Barca philosophy and who is performing at a high level, will always be an option,” Abidal said. “From there, at the sports level we can make decisions, but the whole financial issue, there are things that you can reach and others that you cannot.</p>
      <p>“The future will say. If it continues at this level, because the season is very long, I will not say that it will be option number 1 but it can be a clear option.”</p>
      <p>However they will face competition with reports also claiming that Chelsea are keen to do a deal and will rival Barcelona for his signature.</p>
