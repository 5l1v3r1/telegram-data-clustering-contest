      <h1>Whatever happened to Gareth Farrelly? Everton's saviour took an interesting new career direction</h1>
      <h2>A serious illness towards the end of his playing days helped convince former Everton midfielder Gareth Farrelly to pursue a career in law</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/chris-beesley/" target="_blank">Chris Beesley</a></address>
      <p>He's the man whose goal famously saved Everton from the relegation trap door but now as a qualified lawyer Gareth Farrelly works to help fellow footballers from the numerous off-the-field pitfalls they can walk into.</p>
      <p>After long-distance phone calls to Houston and Bangalore, the <i>Whatever happened to?</i> series has taken a distinct change of pace.</p>
      <p>Just a wind-assisted Tim Howard punt from the ECHO office in the heart of Liverpool's business district, Farrelly, 44, works as a solicitor for law firm Bermans.</p>
      <p>He told the ECHO: “There's a huge amount written now about career transition, mental health and well-being and I think people can struggle when football finishes, especially when so much of their identity is associated with the game and that can be really difficult if it's all you've ever known.</p>
      <p>“What I'm passionate about and one of the core reasons I became a lawyer was that I was mis-sold countless financial products, specifically film tax partnerships.</p>
      <p>“I talk about the sports law side of my interests but fundamentally I had a really keen interest in litigation because I wanted to try and figure out and unravel the products I'd been sold over the years.</p>
      <p>“My core practice is that I'm a commercial litigator. As a consequence of that a lot of my work is with current or former footballers who have had similar experiences to me and I'm passionate about trying to protect and educate them to avoid the stereotypical pitfalls that are there.</p>
      <p>“I'm not financially sophisticated but if you look at the wealth involved in the game now there's an incredible challenge there.</p>
      <p>“There's so much money in the industry, it attracts people who are not acting in the best interest of the individual but want to make money for themselves and there's a huge issue around that with agents, financial advisers and the people who devise these schemes – a whole industry in and around the game.”</p>
      <p>So just how did Farrelly make the unusual career move from football to law? He cites the serious illness he suffered in May 2008 – a decade after his iconic strike for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> – as the catalyst for crystallising his thoughts.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had an aneurysm of the splenic artery (the blood vessel that takes oxygenated blood to the spleen) and statistics show that there's a 90% mortality rate from that.</p>
      <p>“It's not that I'm trying to make it sound grander than it is. I was extremely lucky because of the care I got from the moment that I phoned an ambulance to the time I left hospital.</p>
      <p>“I'm a massive advocate of the National Health Service and I'm only sat here because of them.</p>
      <p>“I'm eternally grateful and thankful for those people every day. The specialist who I had in hospital was on call once a month. He was incredible and he transferred me to Walsgrave hospital in Coventry where the surgeon was who operated on me, who was amazing, and all the people that I met and the interactions that I had were incredible.</p>
      <p>“I did what all athletes would do after that, I thought: 'Am I going to be able to play football again?'</p>

      <p>“I was solely focused on that. A had a nine-month recovery and did part of that at Preston before going to Morecambe on a non-contract basis but I kind of knew that there was going to be a question mark over my fitness given what had happened to me.</p>
      <p>“I thought I'm 32 now, what would I like to do for the rest of my days?”</p>
      <p>Farrelly added: “From a footballing point of view I'd made my mistakes in my 20s. I fell out with managers, I made bad decisions and got distracted too easily.</p>
      <p>“After my illness I was relieved to be alive to a degree but it helped focus the mind that it was unlikely that I was going to play in the Premier League or Championship again and needed to start giving consideration to what I was going to do now.”</p>
      <p>Thinking about making such a radical step and actually doing it are two very different things though and Farrelly then had to embark on the long process of getting himself qualified to practice law.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was really lucky. I went to a university in Liverpool to ask about doing the law and they were incredibly dismissive of me. Their attitude was: 'You haven't been in education, you're a footballer, what could you possibly know about doing the law? Go away for a few years and contemplate a foundation degree and only then may you possibly look at doing it.'</p>
      <p>“I then went to Edge Hill University in Ormskirk and it was the total opposite experience.</p>
      <p>“I went to an open day and asked whether there was a pathway towards law and they were incredibly supportive and told me about a fast-track course that they operated.</p>
      <p>“I had no academic skills of any sort and no email address – I didn't know what I was doing – but I met the head of department who has become a friend, Franco Rizzuto, who was incredible.</p>
      <p>“He was quite sobering in his conversations in that he told me it would take six-to-seven years to become a lawyer, and was it something I thought I was up for but I told him: 'I think I would really like it.'</p>
      <p>“I did the six-week fast track course over the summer ahead of doing a degree. I returned to Morecambe but I'd made my mind up that university was starting in September and I would be going back.</p>
      <p>“I did a three-year Law degree, went to Law school for a year, then secured a training contract and I'll be two years qualified on New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>“So I'm still learning the law but I don't think you ever stop learning the law. I've been fortunate though that with my transition I found something that I quite liked.”</p>

      <p>Farrelly actually had a couple of high-profile experiences during his playing career that helped whet his appetite for a legal career – even though neither had particularly satisfactory outcomes for him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I've had lots of legal situations over the course of my life as everybody possibly would.</p>
      <p>“The Cork City one was a difficult one because after my illness Cork City went into administration.</p>
      <p>“The administrator at the time looked to separate me from the playing staff and present me as a contingent creditor which meant he didn't have to pay me any money.</p>
      <p>“Post administration there was a case that I had to bring demonstrate that I was still a player and I still wanted to play at that time but they didn't want me back so it made it incredibly challenging.</p>
      <p>“So I took a legal case and won but the club were liquidated so I did not recover any of the funds that had been secured by way of the judgement.</p>
      <p>“I'd incurred a lot of costs bringing the case and in the end I didn't receive any of the money that I'd been awarded.”</p>
      <p>Farrelly added: “Before that when I first signed for Cork City we got caught out on the 'three club rule' (that players could not play for three different clubs within the space of a year).</p>
      <p>“There was two of us, myself and Colin Healy, so we'd signed for Cork in the February with a view to starting in the March (the League of Ireland Premier Division runs a Spring through to Autumn season) but then we were told we wouldn't be able to play until July 1.</p>
      <p>“We ended up taking a case all the way to CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport) and we did the classic Irish thing of putting up a terrific fight but we got spanked 3-0 by the judges on the day.</p>
      <p>“Going there to Lausanne was an incredible experience to see the tradition within the court building and how the procedure worked with Swiss law and they did actually change the law after our case to say that the three club rule was still in place but if there were overlapping seasons then it wouldn't take effect.</p>
      <p>“I thought if I ever went into law then I'd love to come back here in a particular capacity so this year to be appointed as a CAS arbitrator was a really big thing, although I haven't had a case yet.</p>
      <p>“Within the footballing context you have all your role models, goals and aspirations but I thought if I could be sat there opposite where we were, that would be really good.”</p>

      <p>Given that he seems to have been incredibly driven in embarking on his legal career, Farrelly appears, at face value, somewhat different than so many other players who when asked what they would do if they weren't in football, just shrug their shoulders.</p>
      <p>However, when he's asked if it was all part of a long-term plan, he laughs and says: “God no. No, no, no. I think what tends to happen a lot of the time is that you have to commit.</p>
      <p>“While you're playing football it's only right that all of your energy and resources go into that.</p>
      <p>“It will vary for individuals. Some people will have a career that only goes in one direction while others will suffer an injury early in their career where they have to step out.</p>
      <p>“There can be a host of reasons why a player might start to think about education, possibly at a different stage.</p>
      <p>“When you're young, playing football is all you want to do and you're totally immersed in that but I think the flip side is that the average Premier League career is eight years.</p>
      <p>“If you look at that across a whole life then it's not a long time.</p>
      <p>“I think with my illness, I had to think about it possibly a little bit earlier and it possibly made it a little bit easier for me.</p>
      <p>“I was a player-manager for two years (at Bohemians in his native Dublin between 2004-06) and learned through the error of my ways that I didn't want to do it for a lot longer.”</p>
