      <h1>Roy Keane slams Callum Hudson-Odoi for not taking his chance with England</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea winger started England's final Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:02:52+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:02</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi was criticised by Roy Keane for failing to make the most of his opportunity in the England team against Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate named the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> youngster in the starting XI for his side's final Euro 2020 qualifier, with the winger playing alongside Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling as part of a front three.</p>
      <p>It was a rare opportunity for the 19-year-old, who has started just two Premier League games for the Blues since returning from a serious Achilles injury due to Christian Pulisic's performances in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>However, he failed to impress Keane during the 4-0 win and was replaced by Marcus Rashford just before the hour mark in Pristina.</p>
      <p>"Hudson-Odoi hasn’t taken his chance yet," the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> captain told <i>ITV</i> at half-time.</p>
      <p>"He isn’t stretching the defence and has given the ball away too cheaply.</p>

      <p>"He needs to step his game up in the second half."</p>
      <p>Keane's comments were echoed by fellow pundit Lee Dixon, who felt that the teenager should have been more confident in possession.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> defender also warned that the winger won't get many more chances to impress Southgate on the international stage before England start their Euro 2020 campaign next summer.</p>
      <p>"There are only two games left before the squad is announced," explained Dixon.</p>

      <p>"He needs to just run at his full-back. He has to attack more rather than playing the ball inside."</p>
      <p>England got off to a slow start in Pristina, with Harry Winks scoring the only goal of the first half before the visitors finished with a late flourish.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane doubled the lead in the 79th minute before substitutes Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount also found the net to ensure the Three Lions ended the qualifying campaign with a win.</p>
      <p>England will enter next summer's tournament as one of the top seeds after topping Group A with seven wins from their eight matches.</p>
