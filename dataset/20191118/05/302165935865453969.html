      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 18 — A message claiming that media outlets were barred from giving coverage to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad for fear he might announce negative news is fake, according to a government official.</p>
      <p>A press officer with the Communications and Multimedia Ministry sent the offending message to a media group, with the word “fake” emblazoned over it.</p>
      <p>The message purported that the media blackout was to prevent, among other things, Dr Mahathir from announcing his resignation without naming a successor.</p>
      <p>Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is already presented as Dr Mahathir’s immediate successor.</p>
      <p>Pakatan Harapan was humiliated at the Tanjung Piai federal by-election on Saturday, losing the seat by over 15,000 votes to Barisan Nasional.</p>
