      <h2>Dutch star Bobby was well known for his fancy footwork but decided to pursue his other passion of DJing two years ago.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Beverley Lyons, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/beverley-lyons/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic </a>player Bobby Petta is on track to be No1 after carving out a new career for himself as a house DJ.</p>
      <p>Dutch star Bobby, who was with the Glasgow club for five years until 2004, was well known for his fancy footwork but decided to pursue his other passion of DJing two years ago.</p>
      <p>Two months ago, he went into the Groove City Radio studios to produce his own tracks.</p>
      <p>Bobby said: “I released a track with Saint Luke and it was top 100 and has now gone to No4 in the Traxsource Jackin’ house charts.</p>
      <p>To be honest, it’s really weird but it’s doing well so we’ll see.</p>

      <p>“The fact it’s at No4 in the charts means I am on the right track. I just play what I like to play. For me it’s all feel.”</p>
      <p>Bobby claimed he’s always loved music but never got the chance to pursue his hobby when he joined the Hoops in 1999.</p>
      <p>He said: “I always liked DJing when I was at Ipswich but when I came here it was different.</p>
      <p>“It was only two years ago that I went back to it but I want to produce too.”</p>
