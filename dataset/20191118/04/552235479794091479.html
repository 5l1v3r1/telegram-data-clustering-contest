      <p>A Scots beer-lover completed an 830-mile crawl of the country’s most picturesque<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pubs-bars-and-nightclubs"> pubs</a> in a matter of weeks to bag himself a year’s supply.</p>
      <p>Drew Carter embarked on a “beer bucket list” with a mission to sink a pint in 15 watering holes tipped to have the most spectacular views in Scotland.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old travelled by campervan, train, taxi and ferry to complete the task with his partner Mel and dog Seve Ballesteros in tow.</p>
      <p>He managed to tick off all of the hotspots in just two months, earning himself enough of his favourite beer –Tennent’s lager – to last him a year. His trip took him from the famous sites of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/loch-ness">Loch Ness</a> to the Isle of Jura.</p>
      <p>Drew, from ­Bishopbriggs, near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>, said: “Drinking lager to win lager, that just made sense to me.</p>

      <p>“I recognised how much of Scotland I hadn’t seen and it was a great motivator to keep going.</p>
      <p>“As I started bagging the bars and getting closer to the end, there was no looking back.</p>
      <p>“We swapped our car for a campervan, which made the journey much easier, and shortly, we had 10 bars under our belt.</p>
      <p>“The Jura Hotel was magic and in a unique location, the Argyll Hotel in ­Campbeltown offered some proper Scottish hospitality and the scenery at Macdonald Hotel at Kinlochleven was truly stunning.</p>
      <p>“Everywhere served a fantastic pint.”</p>

      <p>Drew moved back to Glasgow two years ago after 25 years working away from ­Scotland and this year he decided to take on Tennent’s ­ViewPints map.</p>
      <p>He said: “When I read about the challenge, I thought it would be a fantastic way to ­rediscover my homeland.”</p>
      <p>James Hughes, Tennent’s brand manager, said: “We were so excited to hear from Drew and see his and Mel’s journey across land and sea to take in all 15 bars. It’s an impressive feat so congratulations to them both. We hope Drew’s travels encourage others to get out there and take in our beautiful country.”</p>
