      <h3>Manchester United are “confident” of being able to keep hold of Tahith Chong despite interest from Juventus, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/manchester-united-confident-of-keeping-tahith-chong-despite-juventus-interest-11167620/">Metro</a> is reporting that the Red Devils are set to hold key talks with the 19-year-old about a new contract at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The winger is out of contract at the end of the current season and that means that he is free to discuss a potential move away from Old Trafford with foreign clubs in January.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Chong remains on a “basic wage” at Old Trafford, but the club have offered to increase that significantly to a figure close to £25,000 a week including bonuses.</p>
      <p>The story says that Chong has not yet fully decided that he wants a move away, but the Red Devils are said to be facing a battle to convince the teenager to stay at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Chong has made four appearances so far this season and will be hoping to hold down a more regular spot in the first team in the coming weeks and months under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>The same article says that Manchester United would consider sending Chong and Angel Gomes out on loan deals in January but only after the pair have signed new long-term deals at Old Trafford.</p>
