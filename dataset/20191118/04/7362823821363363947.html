      <p>As Ford’s first purpose-built electric vehicle, The Mustang Mach-E is a compact utility that’s about the same size as the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2020-ford-escape-revealed-with-more-room-and-plug-in-hybrid-power">Ford Escape</a>, but features a sportier look infused with plenty of Mustang-influenced styling cues. The Mexican-made vehicle is set to be the first of 16 electric cars Ford launches worldwide by 2022.</p>

      <p>A lineup of five Mustang Mach-E models with a mix of driving range and performance will begin rolling out late next year with two battery size options and a variety of rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive powertrains. Starting prices run from $44,995 to $61,600 before state and federal electric car tax credits are applied.</p>

      <p>All of the Mustang Mach-Es share the same four-door hatchback design with seating for five and a water-resistant trunk under the hood that compliments the rear cargo area. A digital instrument cluster sits behind the steering wheel while a 15.5-inch touchscreen display dominates the center of the dashboard and is equipped with Ford’s next-generation Sync4 infotainment system.</p>

      <p>Depending on the configuration, the Mustang Mach-E will be able to travel from 210 miles to 300 between charges, with rear-wheel-drive versions equipped with an extended range battery pack delivering the longest distance. The California Route 1 looks set to be the least expensive of the 300-mile models at a base price of $51,500.</p>

      <p>The top of the line GT is aimed at delivering the kind of muscle car-like performance the Mustang name evokes. It’s powered by an all-wheel-drive system rated at 429 hp and 612 lb-ft of torque. Ford says it can accelerate to 60 mph in the mid-three-second range, which makes it nearly as quick to the speed as a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/test-drive-the-2020-ford-mustang-shelby-gt500-is-the-most-powerful-ford-ever">Ford Mustang Shelby GT500</a> and puts it in the same league as the most powerful version of the upcoming Tesla Model Y. However, Ford estimates the GT will have a range of 235 miles, compared to 280 miles for the Model Y, which is similarly priced at $62,125.</p>

      <p>Unlike Tesla, Ford isn’t promising any future full-self-driving capability for the Mustang Mach-E, but it does offer an electronic driver aid system with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-centering assist. A limited hands-free highway driving system similar to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/cadillac-mapped-200000-miles-of-highway-for-its-semi-autonomous-super-cruise">Cadilac's Super Cruise</a> will be added later, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/future-product/ford-introduce-hands-free-assist-system-mustang-mach-e">according to Automotive News</a>. The Mustang Mach-E is also compatible with Ford’s Phone as Key feature that allows drivers to open and start the vehicle with a smartphone app.</p>

      <p>Ford has started taking $500 deposits to reserve a spot when the order books open next year. It hasn’t said how many Mustang Mach-Es it expects to sell, but will be launching it with a limited availability $61,000 First Edition model that’s loaded with features and a 332 hp all-wheel-drive powertrain good for 270 miles of range.</p>
