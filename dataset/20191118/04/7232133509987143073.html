      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After a sharp decline below the $0.2600 support, ripple recovered from the $0.2521 low against the US Dollar. XRP/USD corrected above the $0.2600 and $0.2620 resistance levels.</p>
      <p>However, the price faced a strong resistance near the $0.2660 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was no close above the 100 hourly SMA, resulting in a fresh bearish reaction.</p>
      <p>The price broke the $0.2620 support level. Moreover, ripple decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2521 low to $0.2660 high. It has opened the doors for more losses below the $0.2600 support.</p>
      <p>An immediate support is near the $0.2580 level and a connecting bullish trend line on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If there is a downside break below the trend line support, the price is likely to decline further below the $0.2570 support.</p>
      <p>The next major support is near the $0.2520 level, below which the price may even break $0.2500. Any further losses might lead <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/ripple-xrp-price-primed-for-additional-losses-0-2450-next/">ripple towards the $0.2450 support area</a>.</p>
      <p>On the upside, there are many hurdles near the $0.2660 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Additionally, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2645 on the same chart.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a clear break above the $0.2660 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA is needed for a decent upward move. The next resistance is near $0.2685, above which the price is likely to climb towards the $0.2750 resistance area in the near term.</p>
