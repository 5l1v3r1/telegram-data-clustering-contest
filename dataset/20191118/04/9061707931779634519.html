      <h3>'Fire' - Verdict on Rams under Phillip Cocu</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> are making progress under new manager <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/phillip-cocu">Phillip Cocu</a>, says former Rams striker Kevin Wilson.</p>
      <p>Derby are currently down in 16th place in the Championship, having won five, lost five and drawn six of Cocu's first 16 league matches in charge at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>They have produced some good performances on home soil, winning their last four Championship matches in front of their own fans, but Cocu's side have so far struggled away.</p>
      <p>They have only won once on the road - in their opening match of the season at Huddersfield - and have lost their last three away matches, the latest setback coming against arch-rivals Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>While having to try to solve his side's inconsistent form, Cocu has also been forced to contend with the club's off-field problems, involving players <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/richard-keogh">Richard Keogh</a>, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/tom-lawrence">Tom Lawrence</a> and Mason Bennett.</p>
      <p>“I do see progress and to be honest it has been a baptism of fire for the manager, on and off the field,” Wilson told RamsTV.</p>

      <h3>Bogle 'up there' with best in Championship</h3>
      <p>Jayden Bogle will learn from his high-profile mistake against Nottingham Forest, says former <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> striker Kevin Wilson.</p>
      <p>The Rams defender gifted Lewis Grabban the winning goal for the Reds in the East Midlands derby clash at the City Ground, his wayward back-pass seized on by the Forest striker and dispatched past Kelle Roos.</p>
      <p>But Wilson has backed the 19-year-old to bounce back from his costly error.</p>
      <p>"Jayden Bogle is up there as the best right-back in the Championship and as good as some of those playing in the Premier League,” Wilson told RamsTV.</p>
