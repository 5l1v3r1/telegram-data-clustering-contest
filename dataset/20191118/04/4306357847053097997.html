      <h3>Arsenal and Manchester United are both interested in signing Juventus defender Merih Demiral, according to reports in Italy.</h3>
      <p>Italian outlet <i>Tuttosport</i>, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7692707/Arsenal-Manchester-United-AC-Milan-three-way-battle-sign-Merih-Demiral.html">Daily Mail</a>, is reporting that Juventus are preparing to cash-in on the defender should a significant offer come in for him.</p>
      <p>The same story says that both Arsenal and Manchester United have sent scouts to take a close look at the 21-year-old in the lead-up to the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to the report, both of the Premier League clubs made personal checks on Demiral during Turkey’s recent qualifiers against Iceland and Andorra.</p>
      <p>Serie A champions Juventus signed Demiral from Sassuolo in the summer but he has only made one senior appearance under Maurizio Sarri so far this season.</p>
      <p>The central defender’s only appearance for Juventus this season came when he played the full 90 minutes in the 2-1 win over Verona back in September.</p>
      <p>Both Arsenal and Manchester United are thought to be on the lookout for reinforcements in the January transfer window following stuttering starts to the season for both clubs.</p>
      <p>The Premier League sides have only managed to win four of their opening 12 games in the top flight so far this season to leave them off the pace in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>
