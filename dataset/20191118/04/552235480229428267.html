      <h1>'You couldn’t care less' Mum slams NHS after Mason Djemat, 3, dies at scandal-hit Glasgow hospital</h1>
      <h2>Police Scotland have launched a criminal investigation into the death of the youngster at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Pringle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-pringle/</a></address>
      <p>A criminal investigation is under way into the death of a three-year-old boy at Scotland’s crisis-hit flagship hospital campus.</p>
      <p>It emerged yesterday that police were looking into how Mason Djemat died at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow in August 2017.</p>
      <p>His mum Victoria said he was being treated for a rare genetic condition in one of two wards that were controversially closed after contamination was discovered in the water supply.</p>
      <p>It came just weeks before 10-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">Milly Main </a>died at the same hospital after being treated for cancer and contracting an infection through a line used to administer chemotherapy treatment.</p>
      <p>And last December, an unidentified 10-year-old boy <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/prosecutors-probe-death-boy-10-13906704">died at the hospital</a> after he contracted an infection linked to pigeon droppings.</p>

      <p>The children’s site is part of the £842million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, which has been beset with problems since it opened.</p>
      <p>Mason, whose family are from Stewarton in Ayrshire, had the condition Hunter Syndrome and a history of anaphylaxis.</p>
      <p>It is a metabolic disorder that impacts boys and is caused by an enzyme deficiency. It affects brain function and there is no cure.</p>
      <p>Mason had to have enzyme replacement injections every week in sessions lasting five hours each.</p>
      <p>He had undergone a stem cell transplant months before his death.</p>
      <p>His family did not want to comment on the police investigation yesterday.</p>
      <p>In December last year, Mason’s devastated mum Victoria posted on her public Facebook page: “NHS, you took everything from us and you couldn’t care less.</p>
      <p>“Mason has taught me to never give up and fight for the people we love. I love you so much my angel boy. Mason deserves justice and we will make sure he gets it.”</p>
      <p>She also posted a video of Mason on her page showing him just two hours before he died. In it, he can be seen smiling and alert while running about the ward.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Victoria also claims the family feel they “are fighting a war” against NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and vowed to “never give up”.</p>
      <p>Politicians, including Willie Coffey MP and MSP Colin Smyth, have been assisting Mason’s family as they try to get answers.</p>
      <p>The MSP for South Scotland wrote to NHSGGC chief executive Jane Grant in December last year raising concerns over the “lapses in care” and the length of time it was taking to appoint external experts to examine the case.</p>
      <p>He also suggested to the health board chief that any subsequent training set-up for staff as a result of the investigation be named after Mason at his mum’s request.</p>
      <p>Health board bosses launched their own investigation into the events leading up to the <br/>child’s death.</p>
      <p>When the Record approached the family at home, a man answered the door who said he was Mason’s grandfather.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged Victoria’s posts on Facebook but refused to comment further.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland confirmed they were investigating Mason’s death and that a report had been sent to the Procurator Fiscal.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the Crown Office said: “The procurator fiscal has received a report in connection with the death of a three-year-old boy at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</p>
      <p>“The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit, is ongoing and the family will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments.”</p>
      <p>The procurator fiscal has a duty to investigate all sudden and unexplained deaths, as well as deaths which have occurred in circumstances that give rise to serious public concern.</p>
      <p>Asked about Mason’s death, an NHSGGC spokeswoman said: “We fully investigated this child’s death at the time and also asked for two independent experts to investigate the case, the outcome of which has been communicated to the family.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to questions they have. In this case, the full findings were shared with the family.”</p>
      <p>Details of Mason’s death being investigated emerged days after the Record reported claims that Milly Main, 10, had died after contracting an infection from dirty water at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Milly had leukaemia from the age of five and spent two years in the former Yorkhill Children’s Hospital before being given the all-clear.</p>
      <p>But when the disease returned, she was taken in to the QEUH for further treatment, which was again successful.</p>
      <p>She was cancer-free and ready to go home when she contracted an infection through a line used <br/>to administer chemotherapy treatment.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Milly’s mum Kimberly said: “We were never given any clear indication of what caused Milly’s death.”</p>
      <p>We revealed exclusively last week that Labour MSP Anas Sarwar had been approached by a whistleblower who alleged that an internal inquiry at the hospital campus had unearthed a further 26 cases.</p>
      <p>He said: “There was an attempted cover-up of Milly’s death and there are still dozens of families who don’t know the truth about infections contracted in the QEUH.”</p>
      <p>The MSP has called on the Scottish Government to step in and take control with “special measures”, claiming NHSGGC is “not fit for purpose”.</p>
      <p>Monica Lennon MSP, Scottish Labour’s health spokeswoman, said: “All eyes are on Jeane Freeman and she certainly has a lot of explaining to do.</p>
      <p>“Over a year ago, she promised to appoint <br/>whistleblowing champions in every health board.</p>
      <p>“That hasn’t happened and, instead, NHSGGC is discrediting staff who speak out.”</p>
