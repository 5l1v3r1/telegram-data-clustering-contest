      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): The prosecution has called its first formal witness in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) audit tampering trial involving former premier and finance minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and former 1MDB chief executive officer and president Arul Kanda Kandasamy.</p>
      <p>Daman Huri Nor is the first formal witness to enter the witness stand.</p>
      <p>He is currently administrative secretary for constitutional matters and Parliament under the Prime Minister's Department.</p>
      <p>As a formal witness, he was called to confirm that Najib was indeed appointed as Prime Minister from 2009 to 2018, and therefore a civil servant â€” the capacity in which he was charged for the audit report tampering offence.</p>
      <p>While formal witnesses can be cross-examined, they are generally not subjected to questioning by the opposing legal team.</p>
      <p>The court is in recess for half an hour, and the defence teams for both Arul and Najib say they do not intend to cross-examine him prior to the recess being called.</p>
      <p>Proceedings will end at 2pm today.</p>
