      <p><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/player/56194.html">Tamim Iqbal</a> will once again work with coach Mohammad Salahuddin in this season's Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), this time for the Dhaka Platoon team - the pair had played key roles in Comilla Victorians' <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8653/scorecard/1169424/comilla-victorians-vs-dhaka-dynamites-final-bangladesh-premier-league-2018-19">triumph</a> last season. Tamim was the first pick in the draft on Sunday, and the Dhaka side later picked Mashrafe Mortaza too, a second A-plus category player.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/player/56029.html">Mushfiqur Rahim</a> and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/player/56025.html">Mahmudullah</a>, the two other A-plus local players went to Khulna Tigers and Chattogram Challengers respectively. Rangpur Rangers took Mustafizur Rahman, while Rajshahi Royals went for Liton Das. Cumilla Warriors - the name the franchise will go by this season, following the official change in the city's name last year - also signed Soumya Sarkar and Sylhet picked Mohammad Mithun from the locals' A category.</p>
      <p>Among the overseas players, <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12816;type=tournament">last season's highest scorer</a> in the BPL, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/player/318845.html">Rilee Rossouw</a>, was picked by Khulna while Chattogram went for Chris Gayle. Rangpur took Afghanistan allrounder Mohammad Nabi and West Indies batsman Shai Hope, Sylhet took the big-hitting <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/914541.html">Sherfane Rutherford</a>, and Rajshahi picked Afghanistan opener <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/player/793457.html">Hazratullah Zazai</a>. Cumilla picked Sri Lanka big-hitter <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/srilanka/content/player/300631.html">Kusal Perera</a> and England's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/236489.html">Dawid Malan</a>, who was in <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=13075;type=series">red-hot form</a> in the recently concluded T20I series against New Zealand.</p>
