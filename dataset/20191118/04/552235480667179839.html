      <h2>Reverend Richard Cameron’s stand-in told parishioners in Scotstoun that the minister had been temporarily relieved of his duties.</h2>

      <p>A minister who posted homophobic comments on social media was nowhere to be seen yesterday as his shocked congregation were told about his pulpit ban.</p>
      <p>Richard Cameron’s stand-in told parishioners at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow that he’d been temporarily relieved of his duties.</p>
      <p>It comes after Cameron was suspended for heckling Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn during a visit to Scotstoun last Wednesday and retweeting a series of homophobic and anti-gay marriage messages.</p>
      <p>One parishioner yesterday described the situation as <br/>“very sad”.</p>

      <p>“I’ve been coming to this church for 20 years and Reverend Cameron has been here for 15 years. It’s heartbreaking”, she said.</p>
      <p>Another added: “I’m not happy with him. That’s the safest way to put it”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/church-minister-who-branded-jeremy-20874991">Cameron</a> approached the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Labour leader</a> when he visited the Heart of Scotstoun community centre on his 48-hour tour of Scotland.</p>
      <p>He branded him a “terrorist sympathiser” and said: “I thought you’d be wearing your Islamic Jihad scarf, Mr Corbyn.” His shameful Twitter history emerged after the incident.</p>
      <p>Cameron tweeted that “homosexual behaviour is a sin” and said “allowing children to change their gender is wicked”.</p>
      <p>In September, he tweeted: “Christ has the power to <br/>help and change anyone. Obviously, many gays hate this because they want to carry on in their perversion.”</p>
      <p>The Church of Scotland confirmed they had <br/>“administratively <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/homophobic-minister-who-heckled-jeremy-20888213">suspended</a>” Cameron while they carry out an inquiry into the incident as well as complaints about his social media use.</p>

      <p>During yesterday’s church service, Reverend George Cowie told the congregation that Cameron had been told to stay away from the pulpit.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t mean he’s been found guilty of any wrongdoing, it’s just to take Richard out of a very difficult situation while matters are ongoing”, he said.</p>
      <p>“The church received complaints about your minister regarding his encounter with the leader of the Labour Party and his use of social media.</p>
      <p>“As a result, he has been required to step back from active duties.</p>
      <p>“This is a very difficult situation, not just for Richard, Wendy and their family but for others affected and our prayers are with you at this time. The Church of Scotland cares for everyone in this situation very deeply.”</p>

      <p>He said an interim moderator will be appointed to support parishioners.</p>
      <p>At the end of the service, a second minister, Reverend Hilary McDougall, said Cameron and his family are in their prayers as “they dwell in this time of uncertainty”.</p>
      <p>“As they look to the future, they have our compassion and grace”, she said.</p>
      <p>Cameron stood by his Twitter comments when approached by the Daily Record last week.</p>
