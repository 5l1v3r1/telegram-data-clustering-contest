      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:31:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:31</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street's</a> Andrew Whyment has signed a £125,000-a-year contract to keep him on the Cobbles, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The actor has had the best possible news before he heads into the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle.</p>
      <p>Popular Andrew has played dopey Kirk Sutherland on the ITV soap for nearly 20 years.</p>
      <p>Now according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10363661/coronation-streets-andrew-whyment-money/">The Sun</a> he has been given a mega money new 12-month deal by ITV bosses.</p>
      <p>"Andrew is very pleased to have been given a new deal and he feels fortunate for each year he's been in Corrie," said a show insider.</p>

      <p>"And with a cheque for I'm a Celeb in his back pocket he'll definitely be enjoying a lucrative 2020."</p>
      <p>He is due in Australia later in the week as one of the late arrivals.</p>
      <p>Andrew is said to be earning £100,000 for his stint on the show over the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Fans feared he may not be going Down Under after his name didn't appear on the original list of camp-mates.</p>

      <p>But telly bosses are expected to throw him into the action after inside the next few days.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from Paddy Power said: “We were convinced that Andrew Whyment was joining the jungle until his name didn’t appear on the line-up and we’re still absolutely confident that he is one of the late arrivals.</p>

      <p>“But that still leaves one space, and a reality star seems like an obvious choice – especially since the Love Island crew are under-represented this season.</p>
      <p>"After all, Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison joined late in 2015 and went on to win the show.”</p>
