      <h1>Cancer survival rates in Scotland at risk over shortages of specialist NHS staff, report finds</h1>
      <h2>A shock report by MSPs today says the Scottish Government has not put enough cash into tackling the disease.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Vivien Hamilton</a></address>
      <p>Shortages of specialist <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">cancer</a> staff in Scotland’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a> are putting survival rates at risk.</p>
      <p>A shock report by MSPs today says the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-government">Scottish Government</a> has not put enough cash into tackling the disease.</p>
      <p>And it warns the problem will get even worse with a higher number of people living longer and more likely to get cancer.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman was last night being urged to tackle the disease amid the crisis sweeping ­hospitals and health services.</p>
      <p>Cancer Research UK’s chief ­executive Michelle Mitchell said: “The findings of this inquiry are deeply concerning.</p>
      <p>“Diagnosing cancer early can make all the difference but there are major shortages in the staff trained to carry out the tests that diagnose cancer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Cancer services in Scotland are already struggling. Without urgent action, this will only worsen as demand increases.</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government must act now and publish a long-term cancer workforce plan – to enable the NHS to do its best by patients today and prepare for rising demand in the future.”</p>
      <p>Mitchell will speak at the Scottish Cancer Conference today in Glasgow, where the Scottish Parliament’s <br/>cross-party group (CPG) on cancer report will be presented.</p>
      <p>It sets out how the Government’s plans to tackle cancer have failed to take a long-term approach and have been insufficiently funded – hindering efforts to ensure more patients survive.</p>
      <p>This June, more than 18 per cent of patients were waiting for longer than the Scottish Government target of six weeks for a key diagnostic test – more than double the proportion compared to just three years ago.</p>
      <p>The findings will be presented by the CPG co-convener Anas Sarwar.</p>

      <p>He said: “This report must serve as an urgent wake-up call for the Scottish Government.</p>
      <p>“Cancer survival is being put at risk because of a chronic staffing shortage in our NHS.</p>
      <p>This has devastating consequences for patients with cancer and their families and friends.</p>
      <p>“We need a long-term workforce plan backed up by sufficient ­investment and resources to save lives in Scotland.”</p>
      <p>CPG co-convenor Miles Briggs said urgent action was needed to improve cancer services if more people in Scotland were to survive following a diagnosis.</p>
      <p>He said: “The in-depth inquiry conducted by the Scottish Parliament’s CPG on cancer has highlighted in stark terms the major challenges facing cancer services and the failure of ­Scottish Government minsters to provide for the increasing and changing workforce needs, ­especially in the delivery of diagnostic services.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The key message from the inquiry is there simply aren’t enough NHS staff to do the job and, after more than 12 years in control of health, Scottish ministers have not met this priority and outcome in the cancer strategy.</p>
      <p>“Scottish ministers have been warned repeatedly about the impact of this, not just on cancer patients but also on overstretched NHS staff too.</p>
      <p>“A damning report like this must spur ministers into action. We now need to see urgent action to improve cancer services across Scotland.”</p>
      <p>Labour’s health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said last night: ­“Diagnosing cancer early is crucial to improving survival chances.</p>
      <p>This is close to my heart, as an early ­diagnosis saved my mum’s life.</p>
      <p>“It upsets me ­Scotland’s cancer service are struggling and NHS staff deserve praise for going above and beyond for their patients.”</p>

      <p>A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Cancer is an absolute priority for the Scottish Government and our £100million cancer strategy is focused on improving survival rates and ensuring we have the right workforce.</p>
      <p>We are driving a continued downward trend in cancer mortality rates, with recent figures showing <br/>age-adjusted mortality rates for all cancers combined decreased by 10 per cent between 2009 and 2018.</p>
      <p>“Through a range of actions, more people are surviving cancer than ever before.</p>
      <p>“Early detection of cancer is crucial to this continued improvement, which is why, last year, the Scottish ­Government launched an £850million waiting times improvement plan.</p>
      <p>“And only last week the Scottish Government announced additional radiology and oncology training posts to be recruited in 2020.</p>
      <p>“It is important to note Scotland will be the first nation in the UK to offer a key support worker to help with the financial, emotional and wider impacts of living with cancer in recognition of the wider impact on patients and their families.”</p>

      <h3>Tom's story</h3>
      <p>Tom Martin is a former cancer patient with a heartfelt reason to support the call for a long-term plan for more NHS staff.</p>
      <p>While he is now cancer free, Tom had a long 90-day wait to start his treatment, something he worries may have given the prostate cancer he was suffering from time to spread.</p>
      <p>The grandad of eight, from Edinburgh, is now a Cancer Research UK Campaigns Ambassador – a volunteer who campaigns on behalf of the charity for change.</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old said: “NHS workers do an amazing job and I’m so grateful for the treatment and care I received. But cancer services are stretched to the limit, something which is only going to get worse as more people are diagnosed with cancer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Waiting for my cancer diagnosis and treatment was such an anxious time, for me and my family. You don’t know where you stand and there are times you fear for the worst.</p>
      <p>“I know that if cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the more successful the treatment is likely to be.</p>
      <p>“I do wonder if I had been seen earlier, would the prostate cancer have been caught sooner, before it had spread? Who knows?</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government must not shy away from making long-term plans that will ensure cancer services are able to cope now and in the future.</p>
      <p>“People like me will depend upon it.”</p>
