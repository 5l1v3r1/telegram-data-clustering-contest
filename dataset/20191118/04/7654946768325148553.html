      <h1>Prince Andrew says Epstein didn’t mention arrest warrant before daughter’s 18th birthday</h1>

      <p>Prince Andrew claimed he did not know Jeffrey Epstein was being investigated for sexual assault when he invited the disgraced pedophile to his daughter’s birthday party.</p>
      <p>The royal sat down for an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">interview with the BBC</a> that aired this weekend and told journalist Emily Maitlis that he was clueless about the charges against the late Epstein prior to Princess Beatrice’s lavish 18th birthday at Windsor Castle in July 2006.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t aware until the media picked up on it because he never said anything about it,” Andrew told the BBC.</p>
      <p>The Palm Beach Police had issued an arrest warrant for Epstein in May 2006.</p>
      <p>But Prince Andrew claimed he only spoke to Epstein’s then-girlfriend (and alleged madam) Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
      <p>“Because I was asking Ghislaine,” he said. “But even so, at the time I don’t think I… certainly I wasn’t aware when the invitation was issued what was going on in the United States.”</p>
      <p>Epstein flew to the United Kingdom for the lavish half-million-dollar Victorian-themed ball as the arrest warrant loomed against him.</p>
      <p>“So he came to that party knowing police were investigating him?” Maitlis said.</p>
      <p>“Well I’m not quite sure, was it police? I don’t know, you see, this is the problem, I really don’t know,” said Andrew.</p>
      <p>“But, I mean, I’m afraid… you see this is the problem is that an awful lot of this was going on in the United States and I wasn’t a party to it and I knew nothing about it.”</p>
      <p>Also in attendance at his daughter’s birthday was accused sex offender Harvey Weinstein and former wife Georgina Chapman, the Sun reported.</p>
      <p>Epstein was arrested on July 15, 2006 — eight days after the party.</p>
