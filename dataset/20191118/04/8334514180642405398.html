      <p>(Reuters) - The revamped Davis Cup format making its debut this week is fantastic for tennis and must be given a chance to succeed, Britain’s Andy Murray has said.</p>
      <p>The week-long tournament in Madrid’s Caja Magica, involving 18 teams split into six groups of three, is being bankrolled by Barcelona defender Gerard Pique’s investment firm Kosmos, who are pumping in $3 billion over 25 years.</p>
      <p>It is a major shake-up to the 119-year-old Davis Cup that originally had home and away ties played throughout the year, with critics saying a neutral venue will not sell enough tickets and will not have the same atmosphere when teams compete.</p>
      <p>“I respect that (Pique) is trying to do something new and different in tennis,” Murray told reporters. “Tennis is not always the easiest to make changes in and this is a big change.</p>
      <p>“I hope it goes really well because, if it does, that’s fantastic for tennis. I think there’s some people that seem to be hoping it doesn’t go well but I hope it goes really well and that it’s a big success.</p>
      <p>“The players and all of the fans need to try to give it a chance to see how it goes and I think we’ll have a better idea after the tournament is finished.”</p>
      <p>The tournament begins later on Monday with the group winners and two best runners-up moving to the quarter-finals. The final will be contested on Sunday.</p>
