      <h1>Take a look at the first all-electric Ford Mustang Mach-E. (It's an SUV.)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:54:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/sasha-lekach/" target="_blank">Sasha Lekach</a></address>
      <p>Last week Ford thought it played it coy only revealing the name of its first all-electric vehicle (the Ford Mustang Mach-E), but after some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ford-mustang-mach-e-leaks/">simple poking around the Ford website</a>, images, video, specs, and prices of the upcoming vehicles were leaked ahead of Sunday's big reveal in Los Angeles. </p>
      <p>But the leaks, still posted on a <a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/discovered-2021-mustang-mach-e-official-page-w-pricing-models-specs-video-etc.49/">Mach-E online forum</a>, were accurate: Ford's first EV does indeed look like a puffed up, oddly compact SUV version of its Mustang muscle car glory of the 1960s. The car is no longer two-door, but it's still got the pony emblazoned on the front. Its Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition is the most reminiscent of the sporty Mustang of the past, with its zero-to-60 mph in mid-3 seconds and 459 horsepower abilities.</p>
      <p>So it's very much Mustang-<i>inspired, </i>but a clear departure with the electric battery and design (and large size and sloping roof with a sunroof). The vehicle will come with a max battery range of 300 miles and a massive 98 kWh battery (the Tesla Model 3 battery is 75 kWh for comparison). Each car comes with a charging plug, and works with 12,000 public chargers in the FordPass charging network, which also works with charging partners across Europe. With fast-charging, the car adds 47 miles of battery in 10 minutes. </p>

      <p>Arriving in late 2020 for the first edition (only 50,000 cars are expected to be produced globally in the first year) and with other customers expected to receive the vehicle in the first half of 2021, the car isn't technically <i>here</i> yet. It'll be arriving around the same time as Tesla's next compact SUV, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-model-y/">Model Y.</a> Bring it on.</p>
      <p>And yes: It has a frunk! (That's a front trunk — since there isn't an engine taking up space up front.)</p>

      <p>The interior features a 15.5-inch touchscreen (more than a familiar sight for any Tesla Model 3 fans) and is different than anything in anyone's Mustang from the 1960s or even from the past few years. There's also a screen behind the steering wheel to keep drivers' attention in front (unlike the previously noted Tesla that only displays information on a center screen). </p>
      <p>The interface works with voice commands and Ford claims it'll have over-the-air software updates, just like Tesla's, to add new features and tools to the car without the need to bring it into a shop. </p>

      <p>Actor Idris Elba, Ford's recently named spokesperson and <a href="https://www.autonews.com/marketing/idris-elba-ex-ford-employee-star-new-ev-campaign">former Ford factory worker</a> in England, spoke about his Ford connection with executive chairman Bill Ford, noting "Ford is in my blood." </p>
      <p>Chairman Ford spoke about the history of the first electric Mustang and the company's hesitancy to change the iconic Mustang with its ardent fans. "You don't mess with an icon," he said. </p>
      <p>But mess with it they did, and now an emission-free SUV version of the car is added to the "stable" of Ford Mustangs.</p>
      <p>Starting Sunday night, anyone can reserve a spot in a <a href="https://www.ford.com/suvs/mach-e/2021">digital line</a> for the Mustang Mach-E with a (refundable) $500 deposit. You'll be able to actually order the car next year.</p>
      <p>Pricing was also leaked ahead of time, and it looks like the different versions of the car are indeed the below price tags, with the GT edition the highest starting at $60,500. The more pared-down "Select"  version, with only up to 230-mile range and 75 kWh-battery, is under $45,000.</p>
      <p>Here's the starting price breakdown for all the different versions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mach-E Select — $43,895</li>
        <li>Mach-E Premium — $50,600</li>
        <li>Mach-E California Route 1 — $52,400</li>
        <li>Mach-E First Edition — $59,900 (only a limited quantity are available)</li>
        <li>Mach-E GT — $60,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ford's no stranger to electric with hybrids (the Ford Fusion is a popular model) and plug-in hybrids, but the Mach-E is the first all-electric vehicle. An electric <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq2FitIi4V8">F-150 pickup truck</a> is in the works, but an official arrival date is nebulous. So the Mustang gets all the electric glory.</p>
