      <p><b>The warnings are</b> everywhere — you need to defend your business from potential e-mail security threats. The problem? Ninety-seven percent of people globally can’t correctly identify a sophisticated phishing e-mail, according to Intel Security.</p>
      <p>What happens if your business falls victim to a crypto attack? Could you run the risk of losing all your data? Getting locked out of your e-mails for 48 hours? What would the potential loss in revenue be for your business?</p>
      <p>“Organisations often think that e-mail security threats won’t happen in their business — but crypto attacks are a reality in any business, and could have crippling repercussions,” ICT company Uthanda cautions.</p>
      <blockquote>“One of our clients had a large ERP system that ran every aspect of their business. They were hit by a crypto attack that resulted in the entire system going down for 48 hours — from e-mail to stock management. The resultant loss was in excess of R300 000.”</blockquote>
      <p>With e-mail as the lifeblood of corporate communication and the gateway to any business, securing your e-mail data should be a priority in your business.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, with Uthanda and Office 365, it doesn’t need to be a massive undertaking for your IT team.</p>
      <p>Office 365 uses the latest technologies to keep e-mail data private and protected from ever-evolving threats — all while remaining mobile and accessible from your desktop, or anywhere with an Internet connection.</p>
      <p>Because these security features are all built-in and updated automatically, your company’s protection requires minimal involvement on your IT team’s end.</p>
      <p>In Uthanda’s latest e-book, <i><b><a href="http://bit.ly/2Q7CJy0">How to Keep Your Emails and Business Secure</a></b></i>, organisations are provided with six ways that Office 365 can help protect emails from advanced threats. These include:</p>
