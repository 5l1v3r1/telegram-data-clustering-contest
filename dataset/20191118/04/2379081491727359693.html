      <h1>Yuan inches lower amid uncertainty over Sino-U.S. trade agreement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:23:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:23</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>SHANGHAI — China’s yuan inched lower</p>
      <p>against the dollar on Monday, as investors remained cautious</p>
      <p>over whether the United States and China will agree a</p>
      <p>preliminary trade agreement to call a halt their damaging trade</p>
      <p>war.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media Xinhua said on Sunday that China and the</p>
      <p>United States had “constructive talks” on trade in a high-level</p>
      <p>phone call on Saturday, but it gave no further details.</p>
      <p>Prior to the market opening, the People’s Bank of China</p>
      <p>(PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 7.0037 per dollar, 54</p>
      <p>pips or 0.08% firmer than the previous fix of 7.0091.</p>
      <p>In the spot market, onshore yuan opened at 7.0150</p>
      <p>per dollar and was changing hands at 7.0107 at midday, 35 pips</p>
      <p>weaker than late session close.</p>
      <p>Some analysts noted that wording for the FX policy in the</p>
      <p>PBOC’s third quarter monetary policy report was slightly changed</p>
      <p>from past reports, as it failed to mention “strengthening</p>
      <p>macroprudential management.”</p>
      <p>“Given positive development in trade talks, it makes sense</p>
      <p>for the PBOC to feel less pressured to intervene in the FX</p>
      <p>market, and under those circumstances maintaining RMB stability</p>
      <p>could be less of a constraint for monetary policy going</p>
      <p>forward,” economists at Goldman Sachs said in note.</p>
      <p>Separately, China’s central bank unexpectedly trimmed a key</p>
      <p>interbank lending rate on Monday, the first easing in the</p>
      <p>liquidity tool in more than four years and a signal to markets</p>
      <p>that policymakers are ready to act to prop up slowing growth.</p>
      <p>The rate cut bolstered bond market sentiment, Though the</p>
      <p>currency market showed little reaction, a loosening bias could</p>
      <p>lead to downside pressure on the yuan over the long run.</p>
      <p>The global dollar index fell to 97.911 at midday from</p>
      <p>the previous close of 97.999.</p>
      <p>The offshore yuan was trading at 7.012 per dollar</p>
      <p>as of midday.</p>
