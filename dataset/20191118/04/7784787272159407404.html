      <h3>Grimsby manager Michael Jolley was sacked after an explicit rant at two journalists, it has been revealed.</h3>
      <p>The 42-year-old manager was fired by the League Two side on Friday, which is said to have been “following a recent run of poor results”.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7694937/Jolley-lost-job-Grimsby-shocking-interview-local-radio-station.html">Daily Mail </a>report that club officials, including majority shareholder John Fenty were left shocked by Jolley’s rant at BBC Humberside journalists Matt Dean and John Tondeur.</p>

      <p>It followed from a 4-0 home defeat by Leyton Orient last month, with Jolley slamming Humberside’s coverage of Grimsby.</p>
      <p>The now sacked manager personally targets Dean and Tondeur, saying the f-word 58 times in the four minute 12 second clip.</p>
      <p>Jolley ranted to Dean: “You are a f***ing disgrace.</p>
      <p>“Every time you interview me you’re antagonistic, confrontational, who do you think you are, Jeremy Paxman?</p>
      <p>“You are a f***ing disgrace of a journalist. The f***ing radio station gives us f***ing no positive coverage whatsoever.”</p>

      <p>Jolley leaves Grimsby 18th in League Two with just five wins in 15 games.</p>
      <p>But he attempted to address the club’s performance this season, after Tondeur said he believed “Town fans have seen some progress”.</p>
      <p>Jolley said: “We were f***ing 10th going into today, mate. Near the f***ing play-offs and have you seen our f***ing budget?</p>
      <p>“Have you seen our budget. Do you know where we f***ing should be?”</p>

      <p>It is claimed some of the first-team players were left baffled by Jolley’s rant, with many of them having enjoyed a good relationship with long-serving commentator Tondeur.</p>
      <p>Jolley’s assistant, Anthony Limbrick, will take charge of his first game as interim manager against Newport in an FA Cup first round replay on Wednesday.</p>
