      <p>Property worth thousands of dollars was destroyed in a bus inferno when a cross boarder bus, City Bus, caught fire near Gweru-Somabula toll gate.</p>
      <p>Fortunately no one was injured as the passengers managed to disembark quickly, however some goods were burnt.</p>
      <p>By a stroke of luck, members of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces who were passing by managed to stop and help with offloading goods from the trailer to avoid further damage.</p>
      <p>The City Bus which was on its way from Gaborone, Botswana and is said to have started burning after the driver stopped to check a mechanical fault when tyre burst.</p>
      <p>One of the passengers, Ms Gloria Mwale, a cross border trader from Kwekwe narrated the incident to <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/fire-reduces-cross-border-bus-to-a-shell/">the Herald</a></p>
      <aside>“Fortunately, an army truck came from nowhere and the brave soldiers disembarked and rescued our goods which were in the trailer,” said Ms Mwale.</aside>
      <p>Another passenger, Mr Admire Chebundo from Harare, said the bus developed mechanical problems when it was leaving Bulawayo.</p>
      <aside>“At one time, the driver and other crew members tried to fix the problem,” he said. “Then we heard that the brakes were binding. We are lucky that the fire started when we had all disembarked from the bus.”</aside>
      <p>City Bus operations manager Ms Juliet Bokosha confirmed the incident and said investigations are still underway as to what caused the fire.</p>
      <aside>“I can confirm that the bus caught fire in Gweru and the majority of the goods were saved. Investigations are ongoing.”</aside>
