      <h1>Samoa declares emergency after six people killed by measles</h1>

      <p>A massive measles outbreak has claimed the lives of six people in Samoa, prompting the country to close all of its schools and ban children from public gatherings.</p>
      <p>The government is also requiring all of its citizens to get vaccinated as 100 people remain hospitalized — 15 of which are in intensive care — from the deadly disease.</p>
      <p>Of the 716 confirmed measles cases, most of the dead victims are under the age of 2.</p>
      <p>Some residents of the Pacific island nation had been more susceptible to the disease since a large portion of the population was never vaccinated.</p>
      <p>Samoa’s Director General of Health Leausa Dr. Take Naseri said only two-thirds of the country’s 200,000 people were vaccinated. He also said he expects the outbreak to worsen.</p>
      <p>Naseri’s vaccination estimation differs from numbers provided by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, which say Samoan infant immunizations rates plummeted from over 70 percent in 2013 to below 30 percent last year.</p>
      <p>For a few months last year, the Samoan government stopped its immunization program when two infants died in a medical accident involving the vaccine, according to Dr. Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland, in New Zealand.</p>
