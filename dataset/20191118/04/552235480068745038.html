      <h1>Scots grandfather demands apology from President Trump after 10 year US ban</h1>
      <h2>Ex-cop Dave Norris says he hasn't seen his grandson for years after being banged up for 54 days and banned from the country following an immigration row.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sally Hind, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sally-hind/</a></address>
      <p>A former police officer who was locked up in the US over an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/immigration">immigration row</a> is writing to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> to demand an apology for the mix-up which left him unable to see his grandson for a decade.</p>
      <p>Dave Norris, 71, was behind bars for 54 days when a visit to his son’s family in Orlando went horribly wrong in 2009 and told on his release he could not return to the States for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Now the ban has expired, the pensioner is planning an emotional reunion with his only grandson in America – who he has not seen since he was a baby.</p>

      <p>Dave, of Maybole, Ayrshire, said: “This has had a big impact on my life.</p>
      <p>“The only time I’ve seen my grandson, Luke, was when they came over here soon after I returned to Scotland - he was about seven or eight months old and he’s 10 now.</p>
      <p>“I have photos of him and we speak on the phone but it’s not the same.</p>
      <p>“It’s too expensive for my son to bring all the family over each time so he visits himself.”</p>
      <p>Dave flew from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow">Glasgow</a> to Sanford near Orlando in March 2009 for a two-month break with his son Mark, who was preparing for Luke’s birth.</p>
      <p>But the following month Dave was arrested after a disagreement with a waitress in a cafe and held in Green Cove Springs County jail overnight before being handed over to the immigration department.</p>
      <p>Despite having an inward and outward bound ticket, the authorities were adamant he had been living in America for three years.</p>
      <p>He was taken to the Krome detention centre in Miami but the granddad-of-one was never charged, never appeared in a court and was never given any legal advice.</p>
      <p>He says he was denied basic rights by the police, assaulted by officers, barred from contacting his son and ignored by the British Embassy.</p>
      <p>During his time in custody Dave was moved to Hernando detention centre where he was introduced to his newly born grandson over a video call.</p>

      <p>After 54 days in jail he was transferred to Orlando Airport Immigration centre before being accompanied on a flight by two immigration officers back to the UK in July.</p>
      <p>On arrival he was handed his passport back and dumped at Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>Dave originally wanted to sue the US police department and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Department over his treatment but says after all these years he will settle for an explanation.</p>
      <p>He said: “Even when the officers were chaperoning me home on the plane to London they couldn’t tell me what offence I was charged with.</p>
      <p>“They said ‘we don’t know, we’re just doing our jobs’.</p>
      <p>“I have made numerous attempts to get answers over the years over what happened, but my calls go unanswered.</p>
      <p>“I wrote to Obama when he was in power and would like to write to Trump. I would like an explanation and an apology.</p>
      <p>“In the 54 days I was locked up I made lots of friends over there. My Spanish improved and my chess playing too. I still wear my orange prison shorts from jail as bed shorts. But this has changed my opinion of America. I love the country and the people, but the whole system stinks.”</p>
      <p>He now plans to visit his son in the US and hopes to relocate to Cuba in the future to live with his fiancé.</p>
      <p>He said: “I have got to get to the bottom of this once and for all or I’m going to be pushing up daisies not knowing why I went through this.”</p>
