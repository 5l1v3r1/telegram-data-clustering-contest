      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Heather Greenaway, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/heather-greenaway/</a></address>
      <p>New Dancing on Ice judge John Barrowman has slammed panto bosses for bringing the curtains down on his saucy Christmas stage show for being too rude.</p>
      <p>And he vowed that both he and comedy sidekicks the Krankies would be back in a heartbeat – if they got to do a show in Scotland.</p>
      <p>The three entertainers, who have been to panto what turkey is to<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas"> Christmas</a> for more than a decade, hit the headlines back in 2017 when a mum branded their Dick Whittington production in Manchester “disgusting”.</p>
      <p>John, 52, was dropped by stage company Qdos Entertainment for refusing to clean up their double- entendre-laden act and last year the Krankies were forced to go it alone in Cinderella at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>’s SEC.</p>
      <p>As if splitting up the panto pals wasn’t bad enough, in June, Janette and husband Ian Tough, both 72, revealed they were stopping live shows amid concerns for Janette’s health.</p>

      <p>But in an exclusive interview with the<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunday-mail"> Sunday Mail</a>, John revealed they are all eager to do panto again – but only if Scotland comes calling.</p>
      <p>He said: “Janette and Iain were out visiting me here in Palm Springs last week and we all agreed if we were asked to do panto again in Glasgow, we would be back at the drop of a hat.</p>
      <p>“Christmas is panto with the three of us in Glasgow and nowhere else. <br/>Personally, I think they made a big mistake in not asking us back.</p>
      <p>“In 2016, they took us down to a huge theatre in Birmingham to do Dick Whittington, which went fine. But in 2017, they took us to a smaller theatre in Manchester to do the same show.</p>
      <p>Both the Krankies and I thought at the time it was the wrong thing to do but we did it as we were loyal to the company. We were proved right.”</p>
      <p>Manchester mum-of-two Natalia Wood made headlines across the UK after claiming her family were appalled by the constant double entendres in the show, including the line “Alice loves Dick” and Janette poking her pinkie through the fly on her schoolboy shorts.</p>

      <p>John, who grew up in Mount Vernon, Glasgow, said: “One woman was able to create a storm of controversy about a joke Janette and I had done for 10 years – get a grip, get a sense of humour – that’s what panto is all about. It’s innuendo which goes over the kids’ heads.</p>
      <p>“The person who did the complaining could have left but they sat and watched the whole show and then posted on Instagram how wonderful a time they were having with their family. It’s stupid.</p>
      <p>“We did not feel we got any support from the company employing us and when we confronted them, they turned around and said we were not the draws we used to be – bloody cheek.</p>
      <p>“Stick us back in Glasgow and we will show you the draw we have. We will sell out, which is more than they are doing now. Never before have they had to drop their ticket price to £10 like they did last year.</p>
      <p>“If panto won’t have us back, Janette, Ian and I have talked about coming back with a Christmas variety sketch show that we could take on tour round Scotland, so watch this space.”</p>

      <p>Despite no longer getting his panto on, the Torchwood star has been keeping busy – coming third in last year’s I’m A Celebrity and gearing up to be the new judge on ITV’s Dancing <br/>on Ice.</p>
      <p>John, who was a contestant on the first season of the skating show back in 2006, said he will be a very different judge to Mr Nasty Jason Gardiner and is delighted to make his panel debut the year when the first same-sex couple – Matt Evers and Ian Watkins (H from Steps) – take to the ice.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve judged before on all three of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s search for a star shows, so I’m looking forward to dusting off my judging cap.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see it as stepping into Jason’s shoes. He is very good at what he does but he is a very different judge to what I will be.</p>
      <p>I can’t tell you how I am going to judge as I haven’t seen any of the skaters yet. I might say something that might be controversial, you never know.</p>
      <p>“I’ve already said to the other panellists Chris, Jayne and Ashley Banjo, the one I will bring that is different is that I have actually done it.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>“I know what the competitors feel like when they are getting ready to skate through that tunnel. I have experienced the nerves, the anticipation, the amount of time they have put in, the pain and the injuries.</p>
      <p>“You have to jump off the cliff, open your wings and soar. That’s how I try to live my life. I will be watching for all that stuff. I want to sit back and I want to be entertained.</p>
      <p>“If they are going to get a fabulous from me, it has to be really, really good.”</p>
      <p>John, who married his partner Scott Gill in 2013, added: “I am really proud to be a judge on the first show to have a same-sex couple dancing.</p>
      <p>“It spreads the message that dancing isn’t about what you superficially look like – it’s how you skate on the ice that matters. Its about what you do, not about who you are skating with.”</p>
