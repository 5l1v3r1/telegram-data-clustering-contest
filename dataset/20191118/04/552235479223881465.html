      <h1>TV debate row reaches court as SNP and Lib Dems demand their place</h1>
      <h2>The SNP claim the decision to exclude them from TV leader debates deprives voters of a fair choice.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p>Ian Blackford claimed it would be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/blocking-indyref2-branded-undemocratic-scotlands-20899830">“dangerous” for political leaders to ignore Scots’ demands</a> at the ballot box.</p>
      <p>The SNP Westminster leader sent the warning to Boris Johnson and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/jeremy-corbyns-chances-winning-majority-20884567">Jeremy Corbyn</a> after both insisted they would not give the Scottish Government power to hold an independence referendum.</p>
      <p>Blackford condemned the block as his party prepares to go to court on Monday to challenge TV chiefs for leaving them out of a broadcast debate.</p>

      <p>On the BBC, Blackford said the SNP have already won elections in Scotland after pledging to bring forward a second referendum.</p>
      <p>He claimed Labour and Tories will have to listen if the SNP win most seats in Scotland on December 12.</p>
      <p>“The Scots are a thrawn bunch,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If you’re going to tell them your votes don’t count then I think that puts us into a very dangerous situation.”</p>
      <p>The SNP and Liberal Democrats are furious not to be invited to put up their leaders with Corbyn and Johnson on ITV on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Both parties argue televised debates will reach people not normally interested in politics and are undecided.</p>
      <p>While neither parties could win this election, their policies could end up influencing a minority administration.</p>
      <p>Blackford said: “This challenge is not just about the SNP, it’s about fairness for every voter and viewer across the country who have a right to see the real choice at this election on that debate stage.</p>
      <p>“By excluding key parties from the debate, viewers are being deprived of the opportunity to make their own decisions, and voters in Scotland are not seeing their voting patterns reflected at all.”</p>
      <p>Corbyn used a media interview to repeat his opposition to indyref2 after a series of woolly statements on his position during a two-day tour of Scotland last week.</p>
      <p>He said he would “certainly not” consider a ballot in the first year of Government.</p>
      <p>It’s believed an SNP majority at the 2021 Holyrood election would be needed to change Labour’s position.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Corbyn told the BBC’s Marr programme: “Up until then, certainly not.”</p>
      <p>Johnson has repeatedly ruled out any second vote on independence.</p>
