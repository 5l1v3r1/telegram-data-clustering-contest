        <li>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ford">Ford</a> revealed its much-anticipated, all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV ahead of the official opening of the Los Angeles Auto Show.</li>
        <li>Ford also opened an <a href="https://www.ford.com/buy/mach-e/build-and-price.html?config=WANAB-CGW-2021-CX727#/model">ordering website</a> for the Mach-E, where vehicles could be reserved for a $US500 deposit.</li>
        <li>The Mach-E is the first new vehicle to join the Mustang lineup since the iconic pony car’s introduction in 1964.</li>
        <li><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/f-stock">Ford</a> said the Mach-E could be outfitted with an extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive that could achieve 300 miles of range on a single charge.</li>
        <li>In an “all-wheel-drive configuration,” Ford said, the “Mach-E is targeting 332 horsepower.”</li>
        <li>The Mustang Mach-E is priced from $US43,895, with a high-performance version rising to more than $US60,000. The vehicle should arrive in late 2020.</li>
        <li>Two performance versions of the Mustang Mach-E will also hit the market by 2021. The GT trim “is targeting 0-60 mph in under 4 seconds,” Ford said, while for the GT Performance Edition it’s “in the mid-3-second range.” Horsepower for each is 459.</li>
        <li>The Mustang Mach-E will also get Ford’s next-generation Sync infotainment system, featuring a 15.5-inch central touchscreen.</li>

      <p>LOS ANGELES – On Sunday, Ford Chairman Bill Ford and CEO Jim Hackett – with some help from Idris Elba, who worked at a Ford plant in England before he made it big – revealed the much-anticipated Mustang Mach-E.</p>
      <p>The all-electric SUV was controversial when announced. Mustang purists might not have wanted the pony car’s iconic styling and nameplate applied to an electric vehicle, much less a crossover SUV.</p>
      <p>But Ford took the plunge and staged a Tesla-level extravaganza to introduce the newest Mustang to the world.</p>
      <p>Check out the Mustang Mach-E:</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The Mach-E’s design is Mustang up front …</h3>

      <h3>… and Mustang in the back. The distinctive ‘Stang fascia and rear tail lights define the vehicle, along with the galloping pony icon on the grille.</h3>

      <h3>The Mustang Mach-E evolved from sketches that show it was always going to be the ‘Stang of all-electric crossovers.</h3>

      <p>“The Mustang Mach-E wholeheartedly rejects the notion that electric vehicles are only good at reducing gas consumption,” Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product development and purchasing officer, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“People want a car that’s thrilling to drive, that looks gorgeous and that can easily adapt to their lifestyle – and the Mustang Mach-E delivers all of this in unmatched style.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Ford said it would offer the Mustang Mach-E with a “standard-range” 75.7-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery and an “extended-range,” 98.8-kWh battery.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>The latter should yield 300 miles on a charge.</p>
      <p>“The batteries are secured inside a waterproof battery case surrounded by crash-absorption protection,” Ford said. “They are liquid-cooled to optimise performance in extreme weather and to improve charging times.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>A variety of charging options are available.</h3>

      <p>Ford said that at a “peak charging rate of 150 kW, the Mustang Mach-E with an extended battery and rear-wheel drive can add an estimated average of 47 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes while charging on a DC fast charging station.”</p>
      <p>“The standard-range Mustang Mach-E is estimated to charge from 10 per cent to 80 per cent in approximately 38 minutes while charging on a DC fast charging station,” the company added.</p>
      <p>Owners who use a Ford Connected Charging station could “add an estimated average range of 32 miles per charging hour on a 240-volt outlet, based on extended-range, rear-wheel-drive configuration,” Ford said. A mobile charger could add 22 miles per hour on 240-volt power.</p>
      <p>Ford said it would work with Amazon Home to facilitate the installation of charging stations.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Ford capitalised on the lack of a gas engine and drivetrain to create an expansive, open cabin for the Mach-E.</h3>

      <p>Like Tesla with the Model 3, Ford is doing away with the need to carry around car keys.</p>
      <p>“Getting in and starting the vehicle is easy and effortless with Phone As A Key technology, which makes its debut in the Ford brand lineup in Mustang Mach-E,” Ford said.</p>
      <p>“Using Bluetooth, the vehicle can detect customers’ smartphones as they approach, unlocking the Mach-E and allowing them to start driving without getting their phones out of their pockets or using a key fob.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The centrepiece is a 15-5-inch portrait touchscreen.</h3>

      <p>The next-generation Sync infotainment system’s interface “ditches complicated menus, making it easier to access features with touch, swipe and pinch controls that every smartphone owner will be comfortable using,” Ford said.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Yep, the Mustang Mach-E has a frunk!</h3>

      <p>“Mach-E holds another surprise under its hood – a drainable front trunk storage unit,” Ford said.</p>
      <p>“Providing 4.8-cubic-feet of storage space, the front trunk is large enough to comfortably store the equivalent of a carry-on luggage bag. And because it’s drainable, customers can easily pack it full of ice and keep their favourite beverages cold.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The Mach-E will join Ford’s 55-year-old Mustang family starting in late 2020.</h3>
