        <b>On 115 secretly recorded videos of 69 of clerk's colleagues, high-ranking police officers included, they have been caught either changing outfits or using the bathroom facilities, the Long Beach Post says.</b>

      <p>A police clerk has been sentenced to six years in jail for taking covert photos of his colleagues when they were using a bathroom in California's Long Beach Police Department, according to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/police-clerk-jailed-for-filming-cops-staff-in-police-department-bathroom/">the New York Post</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“This case was disturbing on many levels, but it is the complete betrayal of trust that many people cannot fathom”, Long Beach City Prosecutor Doug Haubert said in a statement. “This is the most serious case of invasion of privacy I have seen in my 20 years as a prosecutor.”</blockquote>
      <p>29-year-old Sergio Nieto allegedly had been making recordings of the cops and other police staff for over three months.</p>
      <p>He also confessed to taking photos of 24 Hour Fitness' clients, according to the paper.</p>
      <p>Nieto was caught after a police officer noticed a cell phone pointed at him in a bathroom stall and identified the perpetrator by his shoes, court documents revealed.</p>
