      <p>NEW DELHI: The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/All-India-Muslim-Personal-Law-Board">All India Muslim Personal Law Board</a> (AIMPLB) has said that three plaintiffs will file a review plea in the Supreme Court against the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a> verdict citing ‘inherent contradictions and apparent errors’ in the judgement. The board also said the community will not accept the five-acre land for a mosque at any other place.</p>
      <p>A senior government official told ET the development would not stall its efforts to set up a trust within three months for the construction of the temple. AIMPLB said it would file the review within a month of the November 9 judgement.</p>
      <p>Over the last three weeks, the Centre and RSS had launched an exercise to impress upon the Muslim community to accept the SC order and not let the issue fester by filing a review. In UP, the state minority affairs minister Mohsin Raza also met Muslim clerics, including AIMPLB vice president Kalbe Sadiq, who had told him that the judgement would not be challenged. Prominent Muslim litigants like Iqbal Ansari and Haji Mehboob had also said a review was not called for against the judgement.</p>
      <p>However, after its working committee meeting on Sunday in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Lucknow">Lucknow</a>, AIMPLB said it was exercising its legal right to file a review plea and three plaintiffs had given their assent for the same. Barring celebrated cleric Mahmood Madani and five others, the 51-member executive committee of AIMPLB reached a consensus to file review in SC citing 10 anomalies in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/the-verdict">the verdict</a>.</p>
      <p>“The verdict is self-contradictory, beyond our understanding, inappropriate and with apparent errors. SC has accepted that the mosque was built in 1528, that Muslims prayed there continuously till December 16, 1949, and SC said that acts of placing idols in the mosque on 22-23, December 1949, and the mosque’s demolition in 1992 were illegal,” AIMPLB said. AIMPLB also said it was declining to accept 5-acre land citing the Shariat that a mosque should never be bartered. “We want Babri Masjid’s land. The direction on giving 5-acre land by the SC is to the government and not a direction to the Muslim community. We can decline — it will not be a contempt of court,” AIMPLB’s lawyer Zafaryab Jilani said. “We feel that restitution by granting five acres, where fundamental values have been damaged to the extent of causing national shame, will not in any manner heal the wounds caused,” an AIMPLB statement said.</p>
      <p>AIMPLB members told ET that cleric Mahmood Madani had cited reservations with filing a review but made it clear that no other land should be accepted. Jamiat Ulama-IHind backed AIMPLB’s decision. “SC has agreed that the mosque was not built after breaking a temple. It has cited the ASI,” the organisation asked in a statement. AIMPLB member Kamal Farooqi said: “We felt that if we didn’t do anything, it will set a bad precedent for us and our places of worship. We are not asking for the case to be reopened at all.”</p>
      <p>Influential Muslim voices were specially invited or consulted before the decision was taken. While four voices were strictly against filing of the review, everyone voted against the principle of accepting the land.</p>
