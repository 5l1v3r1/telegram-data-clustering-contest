      <p>A brace by Victor Osimhen and goals by Alex Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze helped Nigeria defeat Lesotho 4-2 in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Group L qualifier in Maseru on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Masoabi Nkoto scored Lesotho’s first goal in the 11th minute, while their second came via a Chidozie Awaziem own goal.</p>
      <p>In the 17th minute, William Ekong’s flying free-kick from 24 yards was parried, and nine minutes later, Alex Iwobi brought Nigeria level. Osimhen saw his pull-out intercepted by a defender, chased the defender, retrieved the ball neatly and passed to Iwobi to drive into the net at the far post.</p>
      <p>In the 36th minute, Chukwueze rose between two defenders to nod home a well-weighted pass from Osimhen for the Eagles’ second goal.</p>
      <p>In the second half, Osimhen slid full length to score Nigeria’s third from a cross by defender Ola Aina in the 74th minute.</p>
      <p>Osimhen again created a chance for substitute Ahmed Musa in the 80th minute, but the captain missed from inside the box. The Lille of France forward scored a second, latching onto a brilliant pass by substitute Ramon Azeez  in the 84th minute.</p>
      <p>With the victory on Sunday, Nigeria have hauled six points and six goals from their two qualifiers to top Group L.</p>
      <p>Home matches against Lesotho and Sierra Leone will be completed in the final phase of the qualifying series next year.</p>
