      <p>It’s rare that LeBron James is on the other end of a highlight-reel play, but that’s exactly what happened in Sunday’s game against the Hawks.</p>
      <p>The Lakers cruised to victory in the game, jumping out to a 69-41 lead at halftime. The game was never close, but the Hawks at least managed to do a thing that might make SportsCenter, so there’s that.</p>
      <p>It happened in the second half of the game, with Hawks guard Evan Turner working on LeBron James. Turner drove the lane, then stopped on a dime and pulled off a sick crossover move that sent James to the floor.</p>
