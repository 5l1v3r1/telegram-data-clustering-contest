      <p>Passengers of SpiceJet created a ruckus and gheraoed officials of the airline after the flight was repeatedly delayed on Monday morning at the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/indira-gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> International Airport. SpiceJet SG8185 between Ahmedabad to Pune with a layover in Delhi was delayed due to operational reason leading to heated tempers among passengers.</p>
      <p>The passengers were first informed that their flight was rescheduled for 8.30 am instead of 8.45 am. The timings were later changed to 10.05 am and then a message was sent stating that the flight will take off at 11 am.</p>
      <p>Dr Arun Kumar Walunj who reached Delhi at 5.30 am from the United States was set to take the flight, however, after the continuous delays he said, “It has caused a lot of problems. I am not well and was hoping to reach Pune early.”</p>
      <p>For Priya Jha, it is particularly taxing as she has her fourth-year law exam at Bharati Vidyapeeth law college. “I hope I reach on time now for the 4 pm exam today,” she said. Naresh Chand has to travel from Pune to Kolhapur and has a bus ticket. I will have to miss the bus now as the flight has been delayed, he said angrily.</p>
      <p>Office goers were upset as they pointed out that Monday morning flights were the most expensive and they were not informed in advance about the technical issues with the flight.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/spice-smartphone/">spice</a> jet authorities, there was a technical hitch on the flight which was expected to land at Delhi from Ahmedabad.</p>
