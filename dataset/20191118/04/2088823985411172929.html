      <p>CHICAGO – Rasmus Dahlin showed no signs of angst inside the Buffalo Sabres' dressing room Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old defenseman isn't worried about his play. Neither are his coaches or teammates. Dahlin explained following a 4-1 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks inside United Center that people outside the Sabres are making too much of him being benched one night earlier.</p>
      <p>"We’re making too big a deal of what it is," Dahlin said.</p>
      <p>All Dahlin cared about was that the Sabres beat the Ottawa Senators. He didn't sulk afterwards or get down on himself. Instead, he followed the benching with a promising performance against the Blackhawks, recording one shot on goal among seven attempts with a plus-1 rating.</p>
      <p>Dahlin's status as a former first overall draft pick magnifies each of his mistakes, and he shoulders immense responsibility as the quarterback on the Sabres' top power-play unit. Though Dahlin committed a few defensive mistakes against the Blackhawks, his resolve impressed coach Ralph Krueger.</p>
      <p>"He came back strong today, which we liked," Krueger said. "He was really positive after the game yesterday and we’re working with him on solutions and what he can learn from that game [Saturday]. We thought he played solid. That was a real positive thing about the game today, the reaction of a young kid like that who gets left out for 20 minutes and comes back fighting and working on improving his game, which he did."</p>
      <p>Dahlin was benched for the third period Saturday night against Ottawa after a shift in which he allowed Senators forward Nick Paul to skate by him to retrieve the puck near the Sabres' net. Dahlin managed to regain possession, only to commit icing.</p>
      <p>Krueger chose to sit Dahlin in a close game that ended with a 4-2 win. The MSG broadcast showed Jack Eichel wrapping his right arm around Dahlin on the bench, and the Sabres' captain told the media afterward, "The pressure and expectations that comes with being Rasmus Dahlin is not easy."</p>
      <p>No one puts more pressure on Dahlin than himself. He planned on being the best player in the world the moment he was drafted by the Sabres and got so upset following an exhibition loss last fall that teammates had to remind him that it was only the preseason.</p>
      <p>"I knew it was going to come," Dahlin said of his recent bout with adversity. "I think I’m handling it pretty good. I don’t get too down on myself and try to stay on the same level."</p>
      <p>Despite the towering expectations, Dahlin had a historic rookie season to become a Calder Trophy finalist. His 44 points were the second-most by a defenseman ahead of their 19th birthday, trailing only Phil Housley (57 in 1982-83), and he played in all 82 games.</p>
      <p>Dahlin despises losing. The second half of last season took a toll on him mentally and physically. He responded by gaining weight and strength this past offseason. Dahlin has also shown the ability to remain composed during games, as illustrated Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Dahlin was exceptional during a second-period power play, rifling a shot on goal that was stopped by Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford and knocking a puck out of the air to allow the Sabres to maintain possession in the offensive zone.</p>
      <p>"You learn when you play," Dahlin said. "I’m 19 and a defenseman. I have a lot more years to learn and it’s not going to come overnight. It takes a lot of time. I think I’ve improved a lot of things from last year. I’m more mature out there. It’s going the right way."</p>
      <p>Amid a night of mistakes from a number of Sabres, fans on Twitter seemed to focus only on the mistakes of Eichel and Dahlin. The latter was penalized for holding with 2:56 remaining in the third period because he tried to prevent rookie Kirby Dach from skating into the slot with the puck. Dahlin also lost coverage in the first period to allow Brandon Saad to have a scoring chance from in front of the net.</p>
      <p>Dahlin, like all of his teammates, began to take more risks when the Sabres were facing a three-goal deficit. He got caught pinching in the third to allow Alexander Nylander to start an odd-man rush. Dahlin, though, was not on the ice for either of Dach's goals or when Patrick Kane scored on the power play. Jonathan Toews pushed the lead to 4-0 with 11:03 left in regulation.</p>
      <p>The Sabres have lost seven of their last eight games to fall to fourth in the Atlantic Division. Eichel has scored each of their last five goals.</p>
      <p>"All eyes are watching him," Brandon Montour, who was paired with Dahlin, said. "He’s a young kid. Everyone is going to make mistakes, myself included, but I was at that point. Everybody gets to that point. It’s tough to come into the league, as a defenseman especially. With his skill set everybody is expecting offense, offense, offense. Coaches might give him a hard time or what not, but it’s a learning process. It’s something that you grow with experience and watching other players.</p>
      <p>"People might be looking into it a little bit too much. Everybody is going to have off games. It’s one of those things where the team is in a struggle right now and trying to find our way. He’s obviously a guy to pick on or what not, but overall, it’s a group struggle."</p>
      <p>Dahlin is operating in a different defensive-zone system than the one he played in under Phil Housley and has note skated on a pairing with the same defenseman this season. Despite the criticism, Dahlin has a team-high 12 assists, and he's largely responsible for the power play's success during the Sabres' 9-2-2 October.</p>
      <p>Saturday was not the first time Dahlin was benched. He sat for the final 9½ minutes of regulation of a 3-2 shootout win over Florida on Oct. 11. Those decisions are part of Krueger's strategy to manage games. Dahlin is still learning that sometimes he should make the simple play, rather than attempting a daring cross-ice pass or pinching in the offensive zone to try to create a scoring chance.</p>
      <p>That's part of a learning curve that will require patience.</p>
      <p>"Before I came to the NHL I wanted to be the best player in the world, blah, blah, blah," Dahlin said. "Then you realize you need to relax a little bit. It’s a long process."</p>
