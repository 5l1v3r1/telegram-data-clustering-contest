      <h1>‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’: Ajay Devgn unveils Kajol’s captivating first look as Savitribai Malusare ahead of trailer launch tomorrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:00:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Ajay Devgn sure kept the best for last as he finally unveiled the first look poster of his wife, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> as Savitribai Malusare in their upcoming venture ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’. The star, who kicked off the countdown to the film’s trailer release last week by launching a set of character posters, finally dropped the first look at Kajol’s character.</p>
      <p>We have to say that the actress' look is every bit arresting as it is captivating in the traditional Maharashtrian getup. The poster also features Ajay’s character of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tanaji-Malusare">Tanaji Malusare</a> sitting on a ledge while holding up a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Maratha">Maratha</a> flag.</p>
      <p>“Savitribai Malusare - Tanhaji ke saahas ka sahara... aur unke bal ki shakti,” he captioned the poster.</p>

      <p>Apart from the many poster releases, the actor has also been sharing short but very intriguing clips from the movie that bring out the various facets of the film. Kajol’s poster comes a day after Devgn released a video titled 'Rishton Ka Farz... Ya Mitti Ka Karz' that sees two people in the rain passing a gold bangle from one to the other while holding hands.</p>
