      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:14:29+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/shyna-kalra/" target="_blank">Shyna Kalra</a></address>
      <p>The Executive Council (EC) of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) has given a nod for introducing Master’s level programmes in health journalism, in collaboration with the Ayush Ministry. The three MA programmes will be on new health media, health communication and communication governance.</p>
      <p>To be eligible for the course, graduates will have to appear for an entrance exam which is expected to assess students in knowledge related to health and governance along with language and knowledge skills. The exam pattern is said to be on the lines of existing entrance exams for PG diploma courses.</p>
      <p>A source in IIMC Delhi office informed <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> that the three courses are expected to run in New Delhi, Kottayam and Dhenkanal campuses of the institute. The IIMC Dhenkanal in-charge, Mrinal Chatterjee, however, commented, “These three courses have been approved and will be launched soon, but it is yet to be finalised which campus would be hosting which course.”</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that some of the IIMC regional centres, including Kottayam and Aizwal, do not have their own campus yet. While the building of the Jammu campus was recently inaugurated, the Kottayam centre is yet to move in to its 10-acre campus.</p>
      <p>The EC is yet to finalise the number of seats and curriculum for these courses, which will be available in English. However, the EC has not decided yet whether they will make it available in respective regional languages of the states (in which the campuses are located).</p>
      <p>The IIMC head-office plans to launch these two-year courses from the upcoming academic session, which starts in June. The application forms are released in March.</p>
      <p>The existing postgraduate (PG) diploma programmes will continue to run as per the norm. On reports of converting existing courses into degree programmes, the official said, “it is not finalised yet”. IIMC across campuses provides post-graduate diplomas in English journalism, Hindi journalism, Urdu journalism, Radio and TV, advertisement and public relations (ADPR).</p>
