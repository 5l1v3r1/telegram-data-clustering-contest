      <h1>Melbourne recruit Ed Langdon is back in Melbourne and wants to help Demons make amends for 2019</h1>

      <h3>Ed Langdon is back living in Melbourne for the first time in five years and determined to play a key role in launching the Demons back into the eight after a nightmare 2019.</h3>
      <p>Melbourne secured the gun wingman from Fremantle last month, along with Greater Western Sydney utility Adam Tomlinson.</p>
      <p>Simon Goodwin’s team were the most disappointing side in 2019, finishing second bottom with just five wins after reaching the penultimate weekend of the season 12 months earlier.</p>

      <p>Langdon was linked to a return to Victoria at the end of 2018 before having his wish granted in October, after playing 68 games for the Dockers, including 43 of 44 in the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old grew up close to Melbourne’s training base at AAMI Park and went to school across the road from The Tan – where the Demons completed a 3km time-trial on Monday – at Melbourne Grammar.</p>
      <p>Endurance machine Alex Neal-Bullen ran the fastest time-trial on Monday as the Demons’ senior group reported back for the first day of the pre-season.</p>

      <p>"It's been a long time coming to move back to Melbourne and being at a big Melbourne club, so it's really exciting to get underway," Langdon said.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to be at a big Melbourne club; mum and dad live across the road; my brother (Collingwood defender Tom Langdon) is obviously next door (at the Holden Centre); and I knew I'd be living in the city.</p>
      <p>"Plus, the way the Demons played two years ago was unbelievable and just to be part of that again this year, hopefully, is an exciting prospect."</p>
      <p>Langdon wasn’t the biggest name to move clubs last month but he could fill a major void on a wing for Melbourne, after back-to-back top-five finishes in the Doig Medal.</p>
      <p>And he won’t be the only former Docker at Melbourne next month, with injury-plagued midfielder Harley Bennell set to train with the Demons from December 3 in a big to revive a career that has been derailed by persistent calf injuries.</p>
      <p>Bennell, who was originally drafted by Gold Coast at Pick 2 in 2010, managed only two games in four seasons before being delisted by Fremantle at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>But after two recent operations and interest from a handful of clubs, Bennell now has an opportunity to be taken as a pre-season supplemental selection.</p>
      <p>“I think he’ll be here in a couple of weeks, so I look forward to training with him,” Langdon said.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully he can get his body right, as we know how good a player he can be.”</p>
