      <h1>Spurs news: Pochettino's big decision for West Ham, Fernandes' transfer comments, Kane's record</h1>
      <h2>The latest Spurs news as Tottenham prepare to face London rivals West Ham in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>It was a good night for some of Tottenham's stars yesterday (Sunday).</p>
      <p>Harry Winks and Harry Kane were both on the scoresheet for England as the Three Lions won 4-0 against Kosovo, while Moussa Sissoko played 90 minutes as France beat Albania 2-0.</p>
      <p>Those players will now return to <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> ahead of the return of Premier League action this weekend, with Mauricio Pochettino's men set to face rivals West Ham at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Ahead of that game, we look at the latest Spurs news here.</p>
      <h3>The selection headache for West Ham clash</h3>
      <p>Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks retained his place in the England starting XI on Sunday as the Three Lions ended their Euro 2020 qualifiers with a 4-0 win over Kosovo.</p>
      <p>But the Spurs man wasn't in his usual position in a holding midfield role, with Gareth Southgate instead playing him further forward.</p>

      <p>And Winks impressed, scoring the opening goal in the game as he netted for the first time in his sixth cap at senior level for England, earning praise from <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/what-gareth-southgate-said-winks-17271822">England boss Gareth Southgate</a> and <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/message-kane-spurs-winks-england-17272144">his team-mate Harry Kane</a> .</p>
      <p>Winks' performance in his new role for England now gives Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino food for thought and he may look to give his midfielder more license to get forward over the coming months.</p>
      <p>That could start with the London derby against rivals West Ham on Saturday, although Pochettino will have options in midfield, with Eric Dier, Moussa Sissoko and Tanguy Ndombele all vying for places too.</p>
      <h3>Harry Kane's impressive record</h3>
      <p>Once again, Harry Kane was on target for England last night in the 4-0 win against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>In scoring against Kosovo, the Spurs man became the first England player to net in every game in a qualifying campaign, with Kane now having 12 goals to his name in qualifying for the European Championships in 2020.</p>

      <p>Kane was understandably delighted to notch another goal, and end the qualifying campaign in style with a seventh win in eight games.</p>
      <p>“As a striker I want to be scoring goals and winning games. I love scoring goals and hopefully I can keep that going into next summer," he told ITV Sport.</p>
      <p>He also equalled two other records with his goal in Pristina.</p>

      <h3>Bruno Fernandes transfer comments</h3>
      <p>Tottenham transfer target Bruno Fernandes has got fans talking after scoring the opening goal as Portugal beat Luxembourg 2-0 yesterday (Sunday) to qualify for next summer's European Championships.</p>
      <p>The Sporting Lisbon midfielder opened the scoring in the qualifier, before Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in the last five minutes to seal victory.</p>
      <p>Fernandes, who was heavily linked with Manchester United, Tottenham and Real Madrid in the summer transfer window, has recently admitted that he has 'dreams to fulfil' as speculation continues to mount regarding his long-term future in Portugal.</p>

      <p>“I’m not worried at all [about transfer window speculation],” Fernandes said after Portugal beat Lithuania 6-0 last Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Since 2016, there's been talk about my possible departure. I’m well, doing my job and doing the best I can. I have dreams to fulfil but I have no need to force my departure.</p>
      <p>“I feel the love here and if I have to leave, I hope I leave good memories.”</p>
