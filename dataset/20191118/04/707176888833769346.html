      <h1>Tata Steel set to announce deep restructuring to boost profits</h1>
      <h2>Europe’s third-largest steelmaker likely to cut jobs but keep open south Wales plant</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:00:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Pooler, Nikou Asgari</a></address>
      <p>Tata Steel’s European arm is aiming to boost profits through a restructuring that is set to involve job cuts at its main British and Dutch plants, at a time of troubles gripping the continent’s steel industry.</p>
      <p>Henrik Adam, who took over as chief executive of Europe’s third-largest steelmaker in July, said he was seeking to make the Indian-owned company “future-proof in all senses” as it faced a “huge number of challenges”.</p>
      <p>It comes as the steel sector grapples with weak demand, trade wars and pressure to shrink its carbon footprint. Tata Steel Europe’s turnround efforts will involve an ambition to slash employment costs by £150m over time, as well as savings on raw materials procurement and a focus on selling higher-value types of steel.</p>
      <p>While the scale of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b1c9890-cd8e-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f">job cuts</a> has not been confirmed, the axe would fall “across the whole business” at all its locations that collectively employ about 20,000 people, though there were no planned closures, added Mr Adam.</p>
      <p>The comments will send a chill through workers at the UK’s largest steelworks in Port Talbot, south Wales, who have endured years of uncertainty and cutbacks in attempts to staunch losses.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just about addressing costs, it’s addressing value,” said Mr Adam in an interview with the Financial Times. “We are working hard on our plans to be operationally cash positive. I think it’s also fair to say that what we [are aiming] for . . . isn’t a simple increase, it’s a fundamental change.”</p>
      <p>Like other European steel producers, Tata has felt a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c9bedc0-b9ab-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea203">squeeze on profits</a> from higher raw material costs and a fall in steel prices, as orders falter from customers in key areas such as carmaking amid a wider slowdown in manufacturing.</p>
      <p>The stormy market conditions have even led to some temporary shutdowns and output reductions in the region, sparking fears of a downturn similar to that in 2015-16 that led to thousands of job losses. Last week a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dc87594a-0462-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">rescue deal</a> by Chinese company Jingye was unveiled for British Steel, which was sold by Tata for £1 in 2016.</p>
      <p>Compounding the sector’s difficulties is a surge in the price of carbon allowances that polluters in Europe must buy to offset emissions, and fallout from trade hostilities between the US and China, which has seen inbound steel shipments mount.</p>
      <p>“We have in Europe a pretty liberal import policy and . . . as a consequence imports which would normally be sold into different hemispheres. But as other hemispheres have quite strict input policies, they’re pushing inputs out and they’re landing in Europe,” Mr Adam said. “To achieve a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/540b596c-053f-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">level playing field</a>, the existing [EU] measures are not really successful.”</p>
      <p>Tata Steel Europe has set a target of £750m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — a key industry measure of profit — for next year. This compares with £576m ebitda in 2018-19 on revenue of £7.1bn. However, Mr Adam admitted that a previous aim of achieving earnings of £450m this financial year was now a “pretty stretched target”.</p>
      <p>The improvement drive comes after a proposal to combine Tata’s European steel operation with that of larger German rival Thyssenkrupp, which the companies said would lead to cost savings, was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5f0feae0-8c3f-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37">blocked</a> by Brussels on competition grounds.</p>
      <p>As Brexit looms, Mr Adam dismissed any suggestion that Tata would jettison its Port Talbot plant, which has long <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a61dc5e2-bc2d-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722">struggled</a> financially.</p>
      <p>“I strongly believe in a togetherness of Tata Steel in Europe,” he added. “We are stronger together. Or, vice versa, weaker alone. Roughly two-thirds of our customers we serve from both supply chains [in Britain and the Netherlands].”</p>
