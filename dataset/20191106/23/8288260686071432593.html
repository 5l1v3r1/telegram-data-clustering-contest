      <h1>'Going places' - Former Aston Villa man issues bold Leeds United transfer claim</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news | Former striker thinks Championship star is the ideal signing for Leeds United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T23:13:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 23:13</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> striker Kevin Phillips thinks there is one potential January signing which could make all the difference to Leeds United’s promotion bid.</p>
      <p>The Whites are currently level on points with Preston North End and Swansea City at the top of the Championship – although that could change after <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion’s</a> clash against Stoke City on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s side have banked 28 points from 15 matches so far as they look to go one better than last season having been beaten in the play-offs in May.</p>
      <p>They have the best defensive record in the league – conceding just eight times so far – but Phillips thinks an addition to boost their options at the other end of the pitch could push them to the Premier League.</p>

      <p>According to the former England international, who also played for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> and West Brom, Hull City star Jarrod Bowen would be an ideal signing.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has already scored nine goals this season, with his latest strike helping the Tigers to a superb 3-0 win against Fulham at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Leeds’ top scorer, Arsenal loanee Eddie Nketiah, has scored five this term while Patrick Bamford has four.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Elland Road side have been linked with Bowen before and Phillips reckons he should be a target when the window re-opens.</p>
      <p>“He’s a quality player and there’s a lot of talk about him moving on. His movement is very good and his technical ability. He’s a player who is going places,” he told Quest.</p>
      <p>“Dare I say it, put him in the Leeds team in January and he might be the difference between them getting promoted or not.”</p>
