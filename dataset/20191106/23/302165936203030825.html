      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 7 — Two former Twitter employees and a third man were charged in San Francisco Federal Court yesterday with spying on Twitter users critical of the Saudi royal family, the US Justice Department announced.</p>
      <p>The two Saudi citizens and one US citizen allegedly worked together to unmask the ownership details behind dissident Twitter accounts on behalf of the government in Riyadh and the royal family, the department said.</p>
      <p>According to a court filing, they were guided by an unnamed Saudi official who worked for someone prosecutors designated “Royal Family Member-1,” which <i>The Washington Post</i> reported was Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
      <p>Those charged were Twitter employees Ali Alzabarah and Ahmad Abouammo, along with Ahmed Almutairi, a marketing official with ties to the royal family.</p>
      <p>“The criminal complaint unsealed today alleges that Saudi agents mined Twitter’s internal systems for personal information about known Saudi critics and thousands of other Twitter users,” said US Attorney David Anderson.</p>
      <p>“US law protects US companies from such an unlawful foreign intrusion. We will not allow US companies or US technology to become tools of foreign repression in violation of US law,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit comes as US-Saudi relations continue to suffer strains over the brutal, Riyadh-sanctioned murder one year ago of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who wrote for, among others, <i>The Washington Post</i>.</p>
      <p>A critic of Crown Prince Mohammed, Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Post</i>, US intelligence has concluded that the prince himself was closely linked to the murder. — AFP</p>
