      <h1>Derek McInnes targeted by Stoke City as Aberdeen boss faces huge decision</h1>
      <h2>The Aberdeen boss faces a huge call on his future as Stoke look set to firm-up their interest.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T23:30:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>Derek McInnes has emerged as one of the leading candidates to take over the vacant manager’s post at Stoke City.</p>
      <p>Record Sport understands the name of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> boss has been placed on a short list of targets by the relegation haunted Championship club after the sacking of Nathan Jones last week.</p>
      <p>And sources in the Potteries say City are now ready to make an official approach to Pittodrie to ask chairman Stewart Milne for permission to hold discussions with the 48-year-old as they close in on the man they believe can keep the club in England’s second tier.</p>
      <p>Reports yesterday linked Steve Clarke to the role but we believe the Scotland manager - who piped <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">McInnes</a> to the hotseat at Hampden earlier this year - has not made it onto the final list.</p>
      <p>In another ironic twist, Northern Ireland boss Michael O’Neill is believed to be among the front-runners having turned down the SFA following the sacking of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gordon-strachan">Gordon Strachan</a>.</p>

      <p>But the interest in McInnes was leaked out of the bet365 Stadium yesterday afternoon - and immediately placed Aberdeen’s hierarchy on a state of red alert.</p>
      <p>The Dons would stand to pocket a small fortune if Stoke did chose to trigger a release clause for McInnes who put pen to paper on a lucrative new contract in the North East shortly after Clarke was confirmed as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alex-mcleish">Alex McLeish</a>’s replacement.</p>
      <p>But Milne will be hoping Stoke lure O’Neill away from Northern Ireland rather than be forced to face up to the prospect of losing McInnes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>O’Neill admitted yesterday to being ‘flattered’ by the interest but refused to rule himself out of the running as he prepares for a daunting Euro 2020 qualification double header against Germany and Holland.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve always said that when I do step away from international management it’s important the club has good ownership and good people to work for so that’s the priority in any thinking I’ll have.</p>
      <p>“It’s always flattering. It’s better to be linked than not linked, let’s be honest. That applies to any job. It’s not a distraction for me. If and when a situation arises you look at that scenario at that point in time but at this minute my focus is on the two games that lie ahead.”</p>
