      <p>Proving it was a well organised affair, aerial shots shared onto his Instagram stories of the event showed a number of marquees set up as stalls in the ground of his mansion.</p>
      <p>It comes after Chris has been accused of taking a graphic artist’s work without giving proper credit.</p>
      <p>Artist Don Mupasi, 25, called out the singer for allegedly stealing one of his artistic pieces on Instagram and demanded he give him recognition.</p>
      <p>Don, from Manchester, said it was a 'bittersweet feeling' to have Brown steal his work.</p>

      <p>He said it while it proves that his art is 'pretty decent', it doesn't benefit him when 'people are willing to just grab it'.</p>
      <p>The artist took to the Internet to criticise the singer, 31, after he discovered the post on Friday.</p>
      <p>The rapper appeared to take the video of a man walking down a road with a starry sunset from Don's page and posted to his own <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> for his 57.6million followers to watch.</p>
      <p>Don posted the video tiled ' <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B14FoAMH7io/">ANOMALY</a> ' in September and admitted he was happy for viewers to re-share his visuals as long as they tagged him in the post.</p>
      <p>He pointed out his requirements for people using his work in the caption: "Feel free to repost, tag us if you do. HD link in highlights."</p>

      <p>It appears that Chris ignored this request and not only removed Don's song choice and replaced it with the Natural Disaster/ Aura song from his Indigo album but also wrote his own caption, posting: "Imagination vibrate wit me".</p>
      <p>Don recently spoke to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-50129193">Radio 1 Newsbeat</a> about the incident.</p>
      <p>He said: "I want people to know it's me who created it. I think that's fair.</p>

      <p>"When he posted it with some hip-hop song over it, it's really not the kind of vibe I wanted for that piece of work. But he just put some weird hip-hop song on it and then made some caption which doesn't really make any sense."</p>
      <p>The artist added: "But if he had tagged me and just gave credit I would have been cool with that, and that would have brought a lot more eyes to my actual work."</p>
      <p>After attempting and failing to get in touch with the singer and his management, The Manchester artist took to reddit to call out the singer publicly.</p>
      <p>Aiming to 'bring some attention to it', Don placed the two videos side and by side and was shocked by the positive response when over 80,000 users supported him.</p>
