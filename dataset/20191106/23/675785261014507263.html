      <h1>Mike Tyson to train Francis Ngannou for potential Tyson Fury fight</h1>
      <h2>Fury called out Ngannou recently as he considers a move into the UFC - and the Cameroonian has responded</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T23:33:01+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 23:33</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Francis Ngannou claims he will be trained by Mike Tyson for a potential boxing fight against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> .</p>
      <p>The UFC heavyweight met Tyson to record an episode of the former world champion's podcast.</p>
      <p>The ring legend later posted a video of him demonstrating body punches on Ngannou.</p>
      <p>And the Cameroonian then tweeted: "Spoke with Mike Tyson and he agreed to train me for when I fight Tyson Fury in the ring.</p>
      <p>"Don't be scared Fury, you called me out and now you'll have to live with it."</p>
      <p>Ngannou looked destined to be the next UFC heavyweight champion but was beaten by Stipe Miocic last year.</p>

      <p>He then lost to Derrick Lewis before rebounding with three victories in succession against Curtis Blaydes, Cain Velasquez and Junior Dos Santos.</p>
      <p>And Fury said recently: "Who's the heavyweight champion of the world in the UFC? The American-Croatian, Stipe Miocic, I'll fight him in a heartbeat, no problem.</p>
      <p>"Or, Francis Ngannou, any of the heavyweights they've got.</p>
      <p>"I'm not afraid of any of them, I'm the Gypsy King; I'm a boxer but I'm one bad ass motherf*****."</p>
      <p>Fury recently defeated Braun Strowman in an appearance in the WWE in Saudi Arabia and is due to rematch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> on February 22.</p>

      <p>He claimed last month that he has also spoken to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> about training together for a move into mixed martial arts.</p>
      <p>"You might see Tyson Fury have his MMA debut this year. It's different but, like I say, Tyson Fury [is] taking over," he said.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I've been speaking to Conor [McGregor] about it and he's willing to train me and it's going to be good.</p>
      <p>"I come from a long line of bare knuckle boxing champions and getting hurt, getting bloodied.</p>
      <p>"You saw in my last fight that there was blood everywhere, it's nothing new to me. It's all a part of my heritage. I would love to get in there and smash someone up.</p>

      <p>"He [McGregor] just said 'any time you're ready, let's go. Come over to Dublin and we'll start training'. I can't wait. I'm going to take him up on the offer.</p>
      <p>"We might be on a double header - The Gypsy King and Conor McGregor. Watch this space."</p>
      <p>UFC president Dana White, meanwhile, has his own plans for Ngannou in 2020.</p>
      <p>"It will be an exciting year for Francis, too," he told TMZ. "There are only big fights for him, and a potential title fight, but France, we finally got France done.</p>
      <p>"We've been working hard to get that place open for MMA and we'll do a fight there, and obviously Francis will probably headline."</p>
