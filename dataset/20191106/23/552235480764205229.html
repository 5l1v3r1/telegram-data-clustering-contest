      <h1>Brendan Rodgers issues Kieran Tierney defence and insists Celtic love isn't diminished by exit</h1>
      <h2>The Leicester boss had similar criticism after leaving Celtic but insists Tierney doesn't deserve any.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T23:30:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers has backed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney’s</a> decision to quit his boyhood heroes for Arsenal – while insisting the full-back’s heart will always belong to Celtic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> boss Rodgers is set to go head-to-head with Tierney in a Saturday evening showdown, the first time the pair have crossed paths since quitting Parkhead for England’s top flight.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>interview, Rodgers admits both he and Tierney have suffered a backlash form the hardcore <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> support for deciding to swap a crack at 10 in a row for careers in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Rodgers’</a> side defying all odds in third place and Tierney now making his mark as first-choice left-back at the Emirates, the Northern Irishman insists they were both right to make the move down south.</p>
      <p>Rodgers also revealed how he talked a teenage Tierney out of a £10million move to the Gunners.</p>

      <p>But he claimed the defender would have been mad to turn them down again in the summer when they returned with a record-breaking £25m bid.</p>
      <p>And Rodgers said: “You can’t take out of him what he is – he’s a Celtic supporter and you can see his love for the club.</p>
      <p>“But his career is short and there was an opportunity for him to go into the most competitive league in the world and he chose to do that.</p>
      <p>“I’m told he has been criticised by some fans for leaving. I understand that and he’ll understand it too. We both know that, for a big part of the Celtic support, there is no other club in the world than Celtic.</p>
      <p>“So when they feel like one of their own has chosen to move on they can’t understand it.</p>
      <p>“Kieran and I both get that. We can see it from their perspective because it hurts.</p>

      <p>“However, there is another side to your career and your life that you have to think about. He has decided to go down there, he has joined a great club and I have no doubt he’ll do very well there.”</p>
      <p>Rodgers plans to give Tierney a warm welcome to the King Power.</p>
      <p>He added: “From a personal perspective I’m very much looking forward to seeing him again.</p>
      <p>“Kieran was absolutely brilliant for me during my time at Celtic – a great boy who was just so committed to playing for Celtic.</p>
      <p>“He gave everything in training and did it with a real winning mentality.</p>
      <p>“Every time he played for Celtic he poured absolutely everything into the shirt.</p>
      <p>“But not too dissimilar to myself, he felt that the next professional challenge lay elsewhere.”</p>
