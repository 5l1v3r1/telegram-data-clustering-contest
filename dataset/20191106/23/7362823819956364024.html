      <p>Smith claimed she was “facing tremendous medical bills, travel costs and paying for the care of her children ad missed work,” according to a criminal complaint filed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in Chester County.</p>
      <p>Smith received more than $10,000 in donations, which were deposited into joint bank accounts with her husband, the complaint said.</p>
      <p>"She made people believe that she had a very serious cancer diagnosis. The fact is she didn't have it. She lied about that," said Acting Chester County District Attorney Mike Noone.</p>
      <p>Amid suspicions that she was faking her diagnosis, Smith appeared on the local podcast “<a href="https://podbay.fm/podcast/1477076345/e/1565877225">The Ever Evolving Truth</a>” in August to defend herself.</p>
      <p>“If anyone straight up came up to me and said, ‘I think you’re faking this,’ I literally would say, ‘OK, you’re coming to chemo with me on Monday,’” she said.</p>

      <p>A GoFundMe spokeswoman said the company is working with local law enforcement to assist in the investigation.</p>
      <p>“All donations will be refunded to the donors in full and the user has been banned from the platform,” she said.</p>
      <p>Smith’s lawyer, Michael DiCindio, did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.</p>
