      <p>KNIGHTDALE, N.C. -- An assistant high school football coach in Wake County is out of a job after a video showing him making racist remarks was posted to Instagram.<br/><br/>"15 seconds of fame in the wrong way. I've ruined the last 12 years of my career," John Hoskins told ABC11 exclusively.<br/><br/>He said it happened one fun night at the bar. The 32-year-old coach at Knightdale High School was celebrating the team's win against Corinth Holders High, when he shouted: "White power, Knightdale. I still love you, N-----"<br/><br/>"Just to set the record, I'm not racist," Hoskins told ABC11 on Tuesday. "I don't mean it in a negative way."<br/><br/>Hoskins said he was caught up in a celebratory moment with friends both black and white.<br/><br/>He said through the years, his friends who are black have said it was OK for him to use the n-word.<br/><br/>"I guess I've been around them for so long. We're friends. I mean nothing from it," he said. "The word can be used in multiple ways. They treat me as any of their own friends."<br/><br/>Hoskins deleted the video but not before someone reported it and shared it with school administrators.</p>

      <p>Out of fear of being a distraction to the team, Hoskins said the next day, he wrote a one-sentence letter to Knightdale's principal and to the head coach, apologizing and resigning.<br/><br/>Hoskins said the players on the majority-black team also accepted the words.<br/><br/>"They joke around. We joke around. They walk up to me and say it. 'Hey coach, just say it. You're a good coach. Just say it.' Once in a while, it slips," he said. "Once a year, it slips. To have them smile and laugh. Besides that, I mean nothing from it."<br/><br/>On Tuesday, the school district superintendent Cathy Moore said she was disappointed and angry by the remarks.<br/><br/>"The language, the context is not OK. And unfortunately, social media will show you a piece of something but not all of something. And this man is an adult. And he should know better," she said.<br/><br/>Wake County Schools said Hoskins' remarks violated the district's code of conduct policy.<br/><br/>Parents in Knightdale will be notified about Hoskins' resignation.<br/><br/>The school district says it is going to continue to follow and tweak its plan of equality and inclusion, which will involve a collaboration among teachers, parents, students and staff.</p>
