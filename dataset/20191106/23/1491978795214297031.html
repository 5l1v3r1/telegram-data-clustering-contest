      <h1>NAB suffers dramatic 10.6% profit fall in wake of banking royal commission</h1>

        <i>Management will get no short-term bonuses or pay rise, with customers owed $1.1bn as a result of scandals exposed by commission</i>
      </p>
      <p>NAB has wound up a traumatic 12 months in which it lost its chief executive and chairman by announcing a 10.6% drop in full-year profit and cutting its final dividend.</p>
      <p>The bank’s full-year results on Thursday also showed that the lender will have to pay $1.1bn back to customers in compensation resulting from a range of mis-selling and misconduct scandals exposed by the banking royal commission.</p>
      <p>The acting chief executive, Phil Chronican, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/07/nab-shares-put-in-trading-halt-pending-announcement-regarding-leadership">who took over when Andrew Thorburn quit in February after heavy criticism </a>from the commission, said the bank had faced a “very challenging” year that had required “significant actions” to deal with past problems and to regain the trust of customers and the public.</p>
      <p>Chronican said the bank was two years into a three-year transformation plan aimed at improving service and compliance. But he said the executive management would not receive any short-term bonuses or pay rises.</p>
      <p>“While we have made progress, it is not enough to be recognised in executive short-term variable reward in 2019,” Chronican said.</p>
      <p>The lender will pay a fully franked final dividend of 83c – down from 99c a year ago – mirroring the cut to its interim payout in May.</p>
      <p>Stripping out the cost of customer remediation and a software overhaul, the bank’s profit fell by 8.6% to $8.2bn as revenue fell by 4.2% to $17.2bn for the 12 months to 30 September.</p>
      <p>Although the bank’s cash profit was still $5.097bn despite the 10.6% plunge, NAB – along with the rest of the banking sector – has been hard hit by the steady fall in interest rates over the past year.</p>
      <p>NAB’s net interest margin – the difference between the interest it earns from loans and what it pays to fund them – declined seven basis points to 1.78%.</p>
      <p>The full-year report blamed the weak operating environment for the “disappointing” result, with earnings declining across its consumer, corporate and business divisions.</p>
      <p>Chronican will soon hand over to the incoming chief executive, Ross McEwan, on a permanent basis. He will then move into the chairman’s role vacated by Ken Henry, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/07/nab-shares-put-in-trading-halt-pending-announcement-regarding-leadership">also announced in February that he was standing down</a> in the wake of the commission’s criticism of his leadership.</p>
      <p>NAB’s poor results were widely expected by the market. Westpac announced this week that it had cut its dividend for the first time since 2009 as its cash profit fell 15%. The bank has also been forced to raise $2.5bn to meet regulatory capital requirements and legal costs related to its near $1bn customer remediation charges.</p>
