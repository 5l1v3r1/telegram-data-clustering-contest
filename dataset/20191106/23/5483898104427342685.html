      <h3>Union members working for the RAA will be on strike on Thursday.</h3>
      <p>According to an RAA statement sent to FIVEaa Breakfast:</p>
      <blockquote>“RAA’s employees covered by the Automotive and Technical Grades Enterprise Agreement, who are members of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), voted to take protected industrial action today.<br/><br/>“RAA is disappointed with this decision but we remain committed to reach a fair and sustainable agreement for all parties.<br/><br/>“We do not anticipate that the planned industrial action will have any impact on RAA’s services.”</blockquote>
