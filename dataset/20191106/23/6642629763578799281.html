      <p>Turkish President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> spoke by phone with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">US</a> President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> on Wednesday and the two leaders reconfirmed they will meet in Washington, DC, on November 13 at Trump's invitation, Turkish officials said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, three Turkish officials had said Erdogan might call off the visit in protest of votes in the US House of Representatives to recognise mass killings of Armenians a century ago as "genocide" and to seek sanctions on Turkey.</p>

      <p>However, officials on Wednesday said the visit would go ahead and that the two leaders had exchanged views on bilateral issues and regional developments during their phone call.</p>
      <p>Turkish sources say Trump and Erdogan have a strong bond despite anger in Congress over <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a>'s Syria offensive and its purchase of Russian air defences, and despite what Ankara sees as the US president's own erratic pronouncements.</p>
      <p>Those personal ties could prove crucial, given <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/nato.html">NATO</a> member Turkey's purchase of Moscow's S-400 missile defence system, which under US law should trigger sanctions.</p>
      <p>Turkey has already been suspended from the F-35 fighter jet programme in which it was both joint producer and customer, and the offensive it launched against Kurdish forces in northeast <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a> on October 9 set the stage for further US retaliation.</p>
