      <p>ELIZABETH, New Jersey (WABC) -- Firefighters battled a large fire Wednesday afternoon at a residential building in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>The 4-alarm blaze broke out at about 3:40 p.m. at a two-story multiple family complex on Westfield Avenue in Elizabeth, and burned through the roof.</p>
      <p>The smoke could be seen from miles away.</p>
      <p>"Upon arrival we were met with heavy fire from the second floor of the main fire building," said Elizabeth Fire Chief Thomas McNamara. "Shortly thereafter our guys did an aggressive fire attack. We had an early collapse inside and forced us out."</p>
      <p>The fire spread to one other structure, but there was only minor damage to the homes on either side.</p>
      <p>There were no reports of injuries.</p>
      <p>About 20 people were displaced from their homes. Residents of nearby buildings were evacuated as a precaution.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire is under investigation. Westfield Avenue is closed in both directions.</p>
