      <p>Todd Warner was captured Oct. 28 at a casino in Pennsylvania, one day after police found the bodies of Frank and Joyanne Warner, both 73.</p>
      <p>Officers had gone to their Washington Township home after getting a 911 call from the couple's daughter, who went to the residence after she couldn't contact her parents.</p>
      <p>Todd Warner was soon identified as a suspect in the slayings, which occurred two months before his parents were due to retire from their salon business.</p>
      <p>He chose not to fight extradition and was returned to Warren County on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It's not known if Warner has retained an attorney.</p>
