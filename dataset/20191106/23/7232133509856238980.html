      <h1>XRP May Target $0.45 in Near-Term Despite Falling Below $0.30</h1>
      <address>

      <p>After a brief period of trading above its long-established resistance level at $0.30, XRP has once again fallen back into the upper-$0.20 region, which may mean that it is in for an extended bout of sideways trading.</p>
      <p>Analysts are still optimistic, however, that the cryptocurrency could see further gains in the near-term, with one analyst setting a target at $0.45 – which would mark a significant surge from its current price levels.</p>
      <h3>XRP Struggles to Hold Above $0.30  </h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/05/30/bitcoin-daily-cboe-futures-chart-has-gaps-galore-when-will-they-fill/">XRP</a> is trading up just under 1% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ripple/">current price</a> of just under $0.30, which is around where it has been trading for the past several days.</p>
      <p>XRP’s inability to decisively close above $0.30 does signal that bears still have strength in spite of the crypto’s recovery from its multi-month lows of $0.24, but it is important to note that any notable break above this level could spark a major uptrend for the embattled crypto.</p>
      <p>Loma, a popular <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/investor-lawsuit-argues-ripple-still-has-to-answer-over-ongoing-xrp-sales">cryptocurrency</a> analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that he believes a break above $0.30 could be sparked by the ongoing Ripple Swell conference, but further adding that there is a decent chance that XRP does not incur its annual “Swell pump” this year.</p>
      <blockquote>“$XRP: Taking a look at the USDT-pairing and I’d say we have at most 10% leading into Swell and that’s IF price clears the 30c resistance. Swell might be an absolute BUST this year,” he explained while pointing to the below chart.</blockquote>

      <h3>Could Embattled Crypto Target $0.45 in Near-Term? </h3>
      <p>Although Loma believes there is a decent chance that XRP does not break above $0.30 in the near-term, Eric Choe, another popular <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/26/ethereum-may-target-260-in-near-term-as-technical-patterns-grow-bullish/">cryptocurrency</a> analyst, believes that if the crypto holds above its current price levels, a movement to $0.45 could be in the cards.</p>
      <blockquote>“#xrp #ripple If red box can hold, possible $0.45,” he concisely noted while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <p>As Swell continues on and as XRP trades sideways around $0.30, it is highly probable that it will quickly grow increasingly clear as to whether or not it will be able to gain enough <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/04/bitcoin-signal-preceded-42-price-10500-flashes-again/">momentum</a> in the near-term to send it towards $0.45.</p>
