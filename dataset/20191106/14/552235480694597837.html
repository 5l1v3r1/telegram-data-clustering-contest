      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:27:30+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:27</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser N Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-n-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Angry paedophile hunters confronted a man at his East Kilbride home after he went looking for underage sex.</p>
      <p>William Kennedy struck up an online relationship with a person he believed was a girl aged 14.</p>
      <p>Hamilton Sheriff Court heard on Wednesday how the ‘girl’ was in fact an adult member of Child Protectors Scotland posing as a decoy.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, 36, formerly of Mount Cameron Drive North, St Leonard’s, admitted sending messages of a sexual nature and an explicit photograph to ‘Dani’ in July last year.</p>

      <p>He also admitted attempting to arrange a meeting with the ‘child’ in order to engage in unlawful sexual activity.</p>
      <p>Kennedy has since moved but his new address was not disclosed in court.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Ray Small called for a criminal justice social work report and a risk assessment, deferring sentence until December 18.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, who has no previous convictions, was allowed to remain on bail and was placed on the sex offenders register with immediate effect.</p>
