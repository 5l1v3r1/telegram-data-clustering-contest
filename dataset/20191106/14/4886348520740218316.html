      <p><b>Bithumb Chain</b> aims to enable the transfer of value, the flow of information, and vertical business integration within a shared blockchain ecosystem. Bithumb Chain is designed as a powerful supplement to existing products, services, and infrastructure. This, in turn, should help every product and platform of the Bithumb Family to capture value from both upstream and downstream of the trading business.</p>
      <p>With Bithumb Chain being the virtual representation of an interconnected modern city – A blockchain city; the products, platforms, and services provided by the Bithumb Family could represent the vital infrastructure of such a city, similar to schools, companies, hospitals, and stadiums. </p>
      <p>To further bolster the infrastructure of this virtual city representing the Bithumb Chain ecosystem, Bithumb Family will use a variety of new technologies adding to the value network of the blockchain. </p>
      <p>Some examples of such new technologies would be a creative EaaS (Exchange-as-a-Service), which is a unique protocol PSP (Profit Sharing Protocol).</p>
      <p>The EaaS allows users to one-click access to the service. Furthermore, the service charge is customizable depending on the settings of the PSP transaction agreement, offering both ease and autonomy for users. The service charge, in turn, becomes part of the income that would be liquidated as soon as the transaction is completed. Charging standards, charging accounts, and supported transaction pairs, are simplified to facilitate the use of the same trading protocol, thereby enhancing efficiency. By incentivising the use of the exchanges, coupled with the simple settings as mentioned, this not only maximizes profit for those that open exchanges, it also provides a novel way to liquidate similar wallet applications.</p>
