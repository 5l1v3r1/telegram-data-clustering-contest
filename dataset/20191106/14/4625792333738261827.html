      <p>The woman who was fired after giving President Trump's motorcade the middle finger over two years ago won a seat on the county Board of Supervisors in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Democrat Juli Briskman beat out Republican incumbent Suzanne Volpe to represent the Algonkian District in Loudoun County after getting 52% of the vote with 99% of the vote having been counted.</p>
      <p>Back in October 2017, Briskman was photographed raising the middle finger to the president's motorcade while she was riding a bike. Many on the Left celebrated her actions, but it cost Briskman her job at Akima LLC, a government contractor.</p>
      <p>She previously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/the-cyclist-who-flipped-off-trumps-motorcade-is-running-for-public-office/2018/09/11/c12cc2d2-b5dc-11e8-a7b5-adaaa5b2a57f_story.html">told</a> the <i>Washington Post</i> that she hadn't considered running for office until she got fired.</p>
      <p>“We have a right to peacefully protest and criticize and express dissent toward our government,” Briskman said before adding that she would "probably" do it again given the opportunity.</p>
      <p>In addition to Briskman flipping one of the county seats blue, Virginia Democrats also <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/virginia-now-a-democratic-stronghold-as-state-senate-flips-to-democrats-as-house-leans-toward-party">flipped both legislative chambers</a>. Going into election day Republicans had slim majorities in both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, however, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam will now have his party in <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/democrats-say-taking-the-virginia-state-legislature-could-signal-national-success">control of the state's legislative branch</a> for the remainder of his term.</p>
