      <p>SEOUL, Nov 6 — Korea’s flagship airline Korean Air has tapped the star power of K-pop group SuperM to appear in their new in-flight safety video.</p>
      <p>Onboard safety instructions about seatbelts, electronic device restrictions and emergency exits are conveyed by seven dewy-faced boy band members who also provide the soundtrack to the video with their track <i>Let’s Go Everywhere</i>.</p>
      <p>The video features a mix of five music genres — hip hop, R&amp;B, electronic, deep house, and synth pop — in an effort to capture the attention of a wide range of passengers, says Korean Air.</p>
      <p>The safety instructions are narrated by another K-pop star, singer BoA.</p>
      <p>Along with celebrity appearances, the five-minute video takes passengers into the future of air travel with sleek, virtual images.</p>
      <p>SuperM reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last month for their debut EP.</p>
      <p>The song <i>Let’s Go Everywhere</i> will be released as a single November 18 and profits will go towards the Global Poverty Project’s Global Citizen campaign which works on issues like poverty, climate change and global inequality.</p>
      <p>Korean Air joins British Airways and Air New Zealand in enlisting celebrities from their respective countries to star in their in-flight safety videos and maintain flyers’ attention. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
