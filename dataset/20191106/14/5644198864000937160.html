      <p>SoftBank Group Corp plunged on Wednesday to a quarterly loss that was far larger than analysts' estimates, hit by the falling valuations of some of its biggest tech bets such as WeWork and Uber Technologies .</p>
      <p>TOKYO: SoftBank Group Corp plunged on Wednesday to a quarterly loss that was far larger than analysts' estimates, hit by the falling valuations of some of its biggest tech bets such as WeWork and Uber Technologies.</p>
      <p>The Japanese investment giant recorded an operating loss of 704 billion yen (US$6.46 billion) in the July-September quarter. SoftBank recorded an operating profit of 706 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.</p>

      <p>The loss compared with an operating loss of 48 billion yen forecast on average by four analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The group's first quarterly loss in 14 years casts doubt on founder Masayoshi Son's high-risk strategy of investing in cash-burning startups, as he is trying to raise a second giant investment fund.</p>
      <p>The investment conglomerate said its US$100 billion Vision Fund recorded an unrealised loss of 537.9 billion yen for the six months as the value of its tech bets such as WeWork and Uber tumbled.</p>
      <p>The Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund, which is run by ex-Deutsche Bank banker Rajeev Misra, has invested US$70.7 billion in 88 companies at the end of September. Those investments are now worth US$77.6 billion excluding exits, it said.</p>
      <p>Last month SoftBank was forced to spend more than US$10 billion to bail out office-sharing startup WeWork after its IPO attempt flopped.</p>
      <p>With increased market scrutiny over the path to profitability for many of its bets on unproven startups, SoftBank is struggling to take them to market - an essential step to unlock capital to keep its investment juggernaut growing.</p>
      <p>The value of most of the fund's listed investments, including Uber, Slack Technologies and Guardant Health fell over the quarter.</p>
      <p>At Uber that slide has continued as losses continue to mount and a post-IPO share lock-up ends, with its shares hitting new lows this week.</p>
      <p>SoftBank's investing activities are propped up by other pillars of Son's empire including domestic telco SoftBank Corp, which on Tuesday reported a 9per cent rise in second-quarter operating profit, beating estimates, buoyed by its cash-cow mobile business.</p>
      <p>SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.</p>
