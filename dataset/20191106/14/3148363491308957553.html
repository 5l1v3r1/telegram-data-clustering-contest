      <p>Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Hildy Angius commented on passage of the declaration, saying: “We have the support of the sheriff, and if it ever gets to the point where the courts would have to get involved because of gun laws implemented by the feds or the state, we would step up and fight them.”</p>
