      <p>The body of a woman between the ages of 25 to 35 was thrown onto a rubbish dump in Cape Town's Blikkiesdorp on Saturday, Western Cape police said.</p>
      <p>While the Springboks' performance against England was dominating headlines, police had the sad task of examing the body of the woman who had been stabbed several times.Â </p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Siyabulela Malo said on Wednesday that she was dumped between blocks M and K in the sprawling suburb which translates to "<a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/cold-and-leaking-shacks-the-long-wait-for-brick-houses-for-the-people-of-blikkiesdorp-20180630">tin can town</a>".</p>
      <p>She has not been identified yet, and police have issued an appeal for help regarding this.</p>
      <p>She was found wearing a blue denim skirt, a black top, a white belt, and pink shoes.</p>
      <p>If this sounds familiar and can help police identify her, Sergeant Witbooi can be contacted on 082 469 6403 or the Delft police on 021 954 9077.</p>
