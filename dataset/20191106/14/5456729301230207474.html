      <h1>Reps investigate ‘parallel’ Minority caucus - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:01:23+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/361262-reps-investigate-parallel-minority-caucus.html" target="_blank">Nasir Ayitogo</a></address>
      <p>The House of Representatives has mandated its committee on ethics and privileges to investigate a matter of privilege brought before it by a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmaker from Delta State, Ben Igbakpa.</p>
      <p>Mr Ogbakpa raised a concern on Wednesday that Kingsley Chinda and three other lawmakers were parading themselves as PDP caucus leaders.</p>
      <p>The three others are Chukwuka Onyema, Umar Barde and Muraina Ajibola.</p>
      <p>Mr Chinda and his group have recently released at least three statements on behalf of the PDP caucus of the house.</p>
      <p>The deputy speaker, Idris Wade, who presided over the plenary, mandated the committee to investigate the matter and report back to the house.</p>
      <p>The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, few months back named Ndudi Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>The announcement caused confusion in the parliament as the PDP, which is the largest minority party in the House, had nominated Kingsley Chinda for the position.</p>
      <p>Other nominees by the PDP for other minority positions were also rejected by Mr Gbajabiamila.</p>
      <p>The PDP had nominated Chukwuka Onyema as Deputy Minority Leader, Yakubu Barde as Minority Whip and Muraina Ajibola as Deputy Minority Whip.</p>
      <p>Mr Gbajabiamila, instead, named Toby Okechukwu as Minority Leader, Gideon Gwani as Minority Whip and Adesegun Adekoya as Deputy Minority Whip.</p>
      <p>Both Messrs Elumelu and Chinda are PDP members.</p>
      <p>The PDP Board of Trustees had mandated a committee to look into the minority leadership crisis that has rocked the PDP caucus. But that committee was later accused of corruption by the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike; an allegation denied by the board.</p>
