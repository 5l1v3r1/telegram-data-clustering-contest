      <h1>Hungarian mayor resigns over yacht orgy tape - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:31:38+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/world-foreign/361294-hungarian-mayor-resigns-over-yacht-orgy-tape.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The mayor of the Hungarian city of Gyor, who was re-elected in October despite being featured in an explicit sex tape, said on Wednesday he is resigning.</p>
      <p>Zsolt Borkai was shown participating in an orgy on a yacht with suspected prostitutes in a video leaked shortly before local elections on October 13.</p>
      <p>The video, posted by an anonymous blogger, also included conversations hinting at corruption.<br/>No proof has been offered to back the suggestion, however.</p>
      <p>A married man with two children, Mr Borkai was narrowly re-elected.</p>
      <p>But he came under pressure from Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party to resign.<br/>He has been expelled from the party.</p>
      <p>He said in an open letter that he will bear the consequences and step down from his post in the north-western city.</p>
      <p>Mr Borkai said he would step down on Friday, a day after he is scheduled to be formally inaugurated.</p>
      <p>He will, however, remain in office in a caretaker role until a replacement is elected in a repeat vote, a process that could take months.</p>
