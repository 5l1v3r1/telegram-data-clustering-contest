      <p>When you're shopping for the <a href="https://musiccritic.com/equipment/microphones/10-best-karaoke-microphones/">best karaoke microphones</a>, the first thing to consider is whether your microphone purchase should include a speaker. If you already have a speaker or amp, you can simply look for a microphone that comes with a receiver. If you don't have a speaker already, you have two options: you can look for a mic that has a speaker built into its handle, or you can purchase an entire karaoke machine system that bundles microphones and speakers together in one convenient package. There are pros and cons to each choice, of course: Mics with built-in speakers won’t offer the same sound quality as mics that connect to an amp, but they tend to be more compact and less complex to set up.</p>
      <p>If you’re just looking for a mic to use at home with a small group of friends, you might want to consider one with extra features like fun LED lights, or a set that includes two mics you can use simultaneously for duets. On the other hand, if you’d like the flexibility to use your mic in public settings or for more than just karaoke, it makes more sense to choose a microphone that’s a bit more professional-looking. Finally, if you’re shopping for a karaoke microphone for children rather than adults, you may want to go with one that’s designed specifically with kids in mind.</p>
      <p>In the list below, you'll find the best karaoke microphones to meet a variety of needs, whether you're seeking a simple wireless mic or a colorful LED-studded option:</p>
      <h3>1. The Best Karaoke Microphone To Use At Home</h3>

      </p>
      <p><b>What it comes with:</b> One handheld microphone, one micro USB cable, one audio cable (Android), and one case</p>
      <p><b>What else you need: </b>A device that will connect to the microphone via Bluetooth or the provided audio cable.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BHLGK87?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19213615-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07BHLGK87">BONAOK Wireless Bluetooth Karaoke Microphone</a> has over 600 glowing reviews on Amazon. It's basically a party in a box: It comes in five different colors, features a built-in speaker, and has 48 LED lights that sync up with music — the louder the sound, the brighter the lights! It has a rechargeable battery and Bluetooth connection, so you can stream music directly from your smart device. Plug your headphones into the audio jack when you're having a solo karaoke session, or use an aux cable to connect the microphone to an external speaker to bump up the sound. And if you don't feel like singing, you can turn off the mic functionality and simply use it as a Bluetooth speaker. The sound quality of the built-in speaker might not be amazing, but at this price point, you couldn't ask for more from a karaoke microphone to use at home.</p>
      <h3>2. The Best Basic Wireless Microphone</h3>

All you have to do is plug the receiver into the microphone jack on your speaker, connect your Bluetooth-enabled device to the receiver, and sing along to music played from your device. The receiver is rechargeable with the USB charging cable, but the microphone itself runs on AA batteries. This is a mic you can use at home or in a more public karaoke setting.</p>
