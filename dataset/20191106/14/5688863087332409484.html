        <b>In an open letter to her local newspaper the Yorkshire Evening Post, boxing champion Nicola Adams has expressed her immense honour in having had the opportunity to represent Britain. The 37-year-old has hung up her gloves on advice from her medical staff to protect her eyes from further damage.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Widely regarded as the pathfinder for women's boxing, Nicola became the first-ever women's Olympic boxing champion at London 2012 when she took the flyweight crown. Coming back from a shoulder injury, she went on to defend her title at Rio 2016, embarked on a professional career and in 2018, within 18 months of doing so, won a world title — the vacant WBO flyweight belt. However, she abandoned all hopes of a third gold in Tokyo next year by announcing her retirement on Wednesday as her doctors warned her that further impact to her would cause irreparable damage. </p>
      <p>"I've been advised that any further impact to my eye would most likely lead to irreparable damage and permanent vision loss. I'm immensely honoured to have represented our country -- to win double Olympic gold medals and then the WBO championship belt is a dream come true... But it's not without taking its toll on my body," Nicola wrote, reported AFP.</p>
      <p>"To my wonderful team, I would not be the fighter I am today without your encouragement and understanding -- what you have taught me goes beyond the ring. Hanging up my gloves was always going to be hard, but I have never felt luckier, And I'm so immensely proud of how far the sport has come,” Nicola added.</p>
