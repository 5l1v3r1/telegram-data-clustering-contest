        <b>Stephen Kenny has named his Irish U21 squad ahead of their upcoming European Qualifiers against Armenia and Sweden.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As expected, Tottenham striker Troy Parrott is not involved <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/ireland-squad-denmark-troy-parrott-new-zealand/">after Mick McCarthy confirmed that he would be in the senior squad</a> for their games against New Zealand and Denmark.</p>
      <p>Aaron Connolly is also not involved for the same reasons while Liverpool’s Caoimhin Kelleher, Stoke City’s Nathan Collins and Southampton’s Michael Obafemi move back down to the 21s from McCarthy’s provisional squad.</p>

      <p>Captain Jayson Molumby and defender Lee O’Connor are both suspended for the Armenia qualifier but will link up with the squad ahead of the Sweden match.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa’s Jack Clarke receives his first U-21 call-up as well as Hearts striker Aidan Keena and full-back Thomas O’Connor, who is currently on loan at Gillingham from Southampton.</p>
      <p>Stephen Kenny’s squad has also been boosted by the return of Trevor Clarke, who has returned to full fitness, and receives his first call-up since the victory over Luxembourg in March.</p>
