      <h2>Amazon Prime will get you a first look at the Black Friday deals as they happen</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:51:27+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Hurrell</a></address>
      <p>Amazon has announced Black Friday officially begins on 22 November - a week before the actual Black Friday date.</p>
      <p>The timing of the announcement is notable because it means people who want to take part in the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/amazon-black-friday-2019-deals-17088511">Amazon Black Friday sales</a> can now take advantage of a simple online trick to see all of Amazon's deal first.</p>
      <p>The retailer is planning to launch daily deals and lightning deals for Black Friday, with the latter running out after a short period of time or until it is fully claimed. That means there will be a rush to secure the best deals.</p>
      <p>Those who have signed up for <a href="https://amzn.to/32mMHht">Amazon Prime,</a> the retailer's premium delivery and subscription service, will get a first look at deals by as much as half an hour.</p>
      <p>Prime also allows for quicker delivery options and access to films and TV series on Amazon Video either free or at reduced prices. It costs £79 per year or £7.99 per month.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>There is a way for people to get Prime absolutely free from now until after Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year.</p>
      <p>Users can simply sign up for <a href="https://amzn.to/32mMHht">Amazon's free Prime offer.</a> They will get access to Prime for an entire month, meaning it will run out shortly after Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>The deal does not come with any catches. You can cancel the subscription after Black Friday before the first monthly charge comes in and it will not cost you a penny.</p>
      <p>By choosing the free deal users will get all the benefits of paying Prime users in time for the Black Friday Amazon sales.</p>
