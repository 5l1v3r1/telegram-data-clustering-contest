      <p>RIO DE JANEIRO,  Nov 6 — Brazil is auctioning drilling rights to four deep-sea oil fields today, which it hopes will raise more than US$26 billion (RM107.6 billion) and turn the country into one of the world’s top producers.</p>
      <p>A dozen oil majors are bidding for the blocks that are estimated to contain as much as 15 billion barrels of oil — nearly double the size of Norway’s reserves.</p>
      <p>The so-called pre-salt deposits are trapped beneath the ocean floor off Brazil’s southeast coast.</p>
      <p>“It’s a historic day for Brazil’s oil sector,” said Decio Oddone, head of the National Petroleum Agency, as the sale in Rio de Janeiro got under way. </p>
      <p>The highly-anticipated auction — Brazil’s biggest ever — comes after President Jair Bolsonaro’s recent push in Saudi Arabia for the Latin American country to be included in the Opec oil producing cartel.</p>
      <p>The government hopes the sale could turn the country into the world’s fifth largest producer in the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>It ranked ninth in 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p>
      <p>Brazil’s state-owned oil giant Petrobras is among the bidders that also include ExxonMobil, Shell and China’s CNOOC.</p>
      <p>Unlike previous oil field sales, the areas up for grabs have already been explored by Petrobras, reducing the risk for buyers.</p>
      <p>Prices are fixed and the winners will be companies offering the largest cut of oil to the government.</p>
      <p>Petrobras has said it plans to exercise its preferential rights for two of the four blocks. It is expected to partner with foreign explorers.</p>
      <p>If the rights to the four areas are sold, it will raise 106 billion reais, or more than US$26 billion.</p>
      <p>The huge windfall would be a boon to Bolsonaro’s far-right government as it struggles to revive economic growth, reduce unemployment and pay down a crippling debt burden.</p>
      <p>Environmental activists held a protest outside the luxury hotel in Rio where the auction was being held.</p>
      <p>The sale comes as Brazil battles to contain a massive oil spill off its northeast coast, which has affected hundreds of beaches. — AFP</p>
