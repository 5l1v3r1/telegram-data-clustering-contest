      <h1>MetLife black cat among 300 feral felines living inside stadium, employees keep them fed: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:45:56+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author">Paulina Dedaj</a></address>
      <p>No, it's not a sign the Jets or Giants are thinking about running the wildcat.</p>
      <p>The infamous black feline that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kevin-harlan-giants-cowboys-black-cat-call">invaded the field</a> at Metlife during Monday night’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a>-<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> game is reportedly among the 300-plus feral cats living inside the stadium and the owners are apparently keeping them fed, a report revealed Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The cat, which many Giants’ fans are blaming for the 37-18 loss, wasn’t just a random omen. An employee who goes by the name “Cat Man” told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/black-cat-who-dashed-onto-field-during-giants-game-is-among-strays-living-at-metlife-stadium/">New York Post</a> that there are “over 300 feral cats in the complex right now.”</p>

      <p>He said that there are “seven or eight colonies at the [Meadowlands] racetrack” which are regularly fed by Metlife employees.</p>
      <p>“The ownership [of the MetLife Sports Complex] pays for it, but I kick in 18 to 24 cans of wet food each week. They love the wet food,” he told the Post.</p>
      <p>The employee said the MNF cat belongs to a colony living in an underground tunnel used by security. According to the Post, the cats were brought in decades ago to tackle the rodent problem at the racetrack.</p>

      <p>But in a statement to the paper, a Metlife Stadium spokeswoman denied a horde of cats live within the complex.</p>

      <p>“We most definitely do not have 300 feral cats living in the stadium. We are an outdoor facility and at times have seen 1 or 2 cats roaming around (most famously last night).”</p>
      <p>She also denied feeding any animals, adding that the New Jersey Sports and Exhibition Authority is responsible for operating the facility.</p>
