        <b>A man who threatened to blow up Malmö central station is to be deported from Sweden after his actions made bystanders fear for their lives, ruled the court on Wednesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 44-year-old man, an Italian citizen, was <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20190610/malmo-police-shoot-man-in-central-station-in-broad-dayligh">shot and apprehended by police on June 10th at Malmö's main train station</a>, after he claimed to be carrying a bomb, prompting an evacuation of the station. It later turned out his bag did not contain either weapons or explosive material.</p>
      <p>However, the threats were "similar to those terror crimes that have been committed in Sweden and other countries in recent years", read the court judgment seen by The Local.</p>
      <p>It noted that several of the victims had experienced "death anxiety", and found the man guilty of making gross illegal threats and violence against a public servant.</p>
      <p>During the trial, the man apologized for what had happened.</p>
      <p>Swedish public broadcaster SVT quoted him as telling the court: "I've had a normal life up until this happened. I have been in Sweden for a year. I had a job and never thought this would happen."</p>
      <p>The court heard that the man had broken up with his girlfriend a few days earlier, and that he was sick with fever at the time.</p>
      <p>He told the trial his memory of the events was "hazy" and that he had become convinced he was being followed by a shadowy group of men.</p>
      <p>A psychiatric examination showed that the man was seriously mentally ill at the time, but that he was no longer suffering from a psychiatric disorder.</p>
      <p>For those reasons, the court said that the crime, despite being described as "serious", did not warrant a jail sentence, but that there was also no reason to sentence him to psychiatric care.</p>
      <p>It instead handed him a suspended sentence and ruled that the man be deported from Sweden and banned from returning for five years. He was also ordered to pay in total 100,000 kronor ($10,400) in damages to the victims.</p>
