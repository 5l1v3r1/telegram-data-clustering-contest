      <p>BANTEN, Indonesia: The Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) deployed more than 150 rescuers to comb the Sunda Strait on Wednesday (Nov 6), as efforts to locate <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/singaporean-diver-missing-indonesia-mfa-12067570">three missing divers including a Singaporean</a> entered the fourth day.</p>
      <p>The team has covered more than 900 sq km of the area between Sumatra and Java, southwest of Sangiang Island in Banten province, where the three men were last seen on Sunday afternoon.</p>

      <p>The missing men were with four other friends on Sangiang Island, about 30 minutes by boat from Merak port.</p>
      <p>Six of them went diving at 2pm on Sunday, but only three returned to shore at 3pm, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Rescue officials believe that they may have been washed away by currents heading towards the Indian Ocean. </p>

      <p>On Tuesday, Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said Indonesian authorities are coordinating search and rescue operations.</p>
      <p>MFA added that it was providing assistance to the family of the missing Singaporean. </p>
      <p>The Singapore Embassy has been liaising closely with the Indonesian authorities involved in the search mission, while a consular officer from the embassy was on the ground to “provide assistance and close support”, it said.</p>
