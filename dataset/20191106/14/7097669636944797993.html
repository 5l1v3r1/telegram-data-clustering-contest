      <p>(Reuters) - Ethiopia is building a giant dam on the Blue Nile, close to its border with Sudan.</p>
      <p>Ethiopia says the hydropower project is crucial to its economic development. Egypt is worried the dam will affect flow of the Nile, its main source of fresh water.</p>
      <p>THE DAM</p>
      <p>The $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was announced in early 2011, as Egypt was in political upheaval following a popular uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
      <p>The dam is the centerpiece of Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter, with a projected capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts.</p>
      <p>Ethiopia has said it will start filling the reservoir behind the dam in 2020, though construction has been hit by delays.</p>
      <p>The first stage of the filling process is expected to take two years and bring the water level in the reservoir to 595 meters out of an eventual 632 meters.</p>
      <p>NILE WATERS</p>
      <p>The Nile Basin river system flows through 11 countries. The Blue Nile and White Nile merge in Sudan before flowing into Egypt and towards the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p>Egypt currently bases its share of the river's waters on a 1959 deal that gave it 55.5 billion cubic meters water annually, and Sudan 18.5 bcm.</p>
      <p>Other countries were not given allocations at that time. Ethiopia was not party to the agreement and does not recognize it.</p>
      <p>EGYPT'S POSITION</p>
      <p>Egypt, which has a rapidly growing population nearing 100 million, relies on the Nile for around 90% of its fresh water.</p>
      <p>Even without taking the dam into account, the largely desert country is short of water. It imports about half its food products and recycles about 25 bcm of water annually.</p>
      <p>Egypt accuses Ethiopia of not factoring in the risk of drought conditions such as those that affected the Nile Basin in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
      <p>While acknowledging such a scenario is unlikely, Egypt says it could lose more than one million jobs and $1.8 billion in economic production annually.</p>
      <p>It therefore wants the first, two-year stage of the filling process to be extendable, and for Ethiopia to guarantee it 40 bcm per year after the first stage is completed.</p>
      <p>ETHIOPIA'S POSITION</p>
      <p>Ethiopia, with a population of more than 100 million people, accuses Egypt of trying to maintain a colonial-era grip over the Nile's waters.</p>
      <p>Addis Ababa says Cairo is trying to hold the project hostage by imposing rules over the filling and operation of the dam.</p>
      <p>It says it is taking the interests of Egypt and Sudan - the other downstream nation - into account, and that Egypt's requirement of a guaranteed 40 bcm is unrealistic.</p>
      <p>It also says that while it could fill the reservoir in two to three years, it made a concession by proposing a four to seven year process.</p>
      <p>Ethiopia has repeatedly rejected Egypt's suggestion of a fourth party mediator, saying Cairo is trying to sidestep three-way discussions.</p>
      <p>TALKS</p>
      <p>Both sides have accused each other of delaying negotiations, which resumed in Cairo and Khartoum in September and October, before stalling again.</p>
      <p>After Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on the sidelines of a summit in Russia in October, the two sides agreed to restart technical talks.</p>
      <p>Egypt has enthusiastically accepted an invitation from the U.S. to separate talks in Washington.</p>
