      <h1>Football Fans Befuddled When it Comes to the Legality Live Streams</h1>

      <p>Football fans claim not to recognise the difference between legal and illegal streams.</p>
      <p>A recent <a href="https://www.olbg.com/insights/fans-of-the-epl/how-do-fans-watch/">survey</a> of footie fans reveals that almost half of the respondents quizzed didn't acknowledge that watching matches on unofficial streams is illegal, which means they're either a bit dim, or are aware it's piracy and just don't give a hoot.</p>
      <p>When quizzed about the legality of devices like Kodi TV boxes, it was almost a 50/50 split between those who claim to think the streams are legal, and those who are aware that they're not. Sounds like a serious case of the silly buggers to me.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, around a third of the 1,000 people surveyed thought that streams on social media platforms like Facebook don't fall within the realms of the legal, and just over a third are confident that using someone else's account to log in to a service and watch the footie is illegal.</p>
      <p>The poll sample wasn't that large, and as always, you can't take for granted that people are going to be answering these questions honestly - especially when they involve fessing up to breaking the law. But if we take the respondent's answers at face value, there are some very confused football fans out there.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, almost half of the fans said they watched matches at home, which means that piracy - even the unintentional kind - has the potential to be a pretty big issue for the Premier League.
