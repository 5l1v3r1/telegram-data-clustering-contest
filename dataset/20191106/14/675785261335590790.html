      <h1>Martin Lewis' astonishing 3-year obsession has seen him cover 22,000km on foot</h1>
      <h2>Every single day for the past three years Martin Lewis has walked at least 10,000 steps - but the money-saving expert insists his 'obsession' is a healthy one</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:47:30+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>No matter the weather, his plans, whether he's on a long-haul flight or even in hospital, Martin Lewis walks at least 10,000 steps a day.</p>
      <p>In fact, he normally covers more than twice that distance on foot in what he admits has become a bit of an obsession for him.</p>
      <p>And the financial guru has just chalked up a major milestone.</p>
      <p>"Just hit 10,000 steps for the day. That means it's now 3yrs without missing my 10,000 minimum target even for a day (including days with illness, minor ops, or long haul flights)," Martin tweeted.</p>
      <p>In fact, he normally doubles that number - with an average of 24,250 daily steps over the past three years.</p>
      <p>"I admit it's an obsession, but a healthy one," he said.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>And his impressive feat has got people intrigued.</p>
      <p>"Martin, really, how do you actually do it? Is it through interviews etc, that you walk across the city to, or some other method too? It's quite astonishing," one person asked.</p>
      <p>"I walk an hour to &amp; from work, where possible all intraday travel is walking," Marin replied.</p>
      <p>"I schedule phone meetings/interviews etc for while I walk, so the time is mostly productive, meaning the 'time cost' of doing it isn't large. Plus I run 40k a week &amp; Mrs MSE likes walking too."</p>
      <p>Asked if he ever had to pace around the house to hit his goal, Martin said it was a rare occurrence - but didn't deny it.</p>
      <p>"I find 10,000 easy as my life is arranged around walking. I do like to hit 20,000 though most days so occasionally pace in the house for that!" he said.</p>

      <p>It also means that he's clocked up an impressive total - almost enough to travel around the world in fact.</p>
      <p>He estimates that over three years he's covered an astonishing 22,000km in total "at a rough estimation".</p>
      <p>Although, while clearly on brand in saving money on travel and expensive gym memberships, that doesn't mean it's completely without cost.</p>
      <p>"How many pairs of shoes have you got through?!," one of his followers asked.</p>
      <p>It was a one question Martin didn't have an immediate answer for.</p>
