      <p>Virgin Media is ditching BT's mobile network for rival Vodafone from late 2021, saying the five-year deal announced on Wednesday would bring innovative new services such as 5G to more than three million customers.</p>
      <p>The British cable TV and broadband company, owned by US group Liberty Global, pioneered the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) model when a company offers own-branded mobile services on an established partner's network.</p>
      <p>Vodafone will supply wholesale mobile services including voice and data to the Virgin Mobile and Virgin Media Business customers under the deal, which runs until 2026.</p>
      <p>Lutz Schuler, Virgin Media CEO, said the partnership would deliver a host of benefits to customers, including 5G services in the near future, and bring mobile and broadband connectivity closer together in one package for one price.</p>
      <p>"Twenty years ago Virgin Mobile became the world's first virtual operator and this new agreement builds on that heritage," he said.</p>
      <p>Vodafone's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">UK</a> chief executive Nick Jeffery said Virgin had recognised the huge investments it had made, and continued to make, in building its mobile network.</p>
      <p>The deal is a new departure for Vodafone in its home market after it previously largely avoided major MVNO partnerships unlike rivals such as BT's EE and Telefonica's O2.</p>
