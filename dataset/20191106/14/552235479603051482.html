      <p>A thief threatened a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bellshill">Bellshill</a> shopkeeper with a knife and screwdriver before making off with two crates of beer.</p>
      <p>The staff member at McColl's store on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bellshill">Calder Road</a> refused to hand over the cash after the brazen robber threatened them at around 3.30pm on Sunday, November 3.</p>
      <p>The suspect then left with two crates of beer and headed off in the direction of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bellshill">Rosevale Crescent</a> .</p>
      <p>He is described as male, of heavy build, wearing a dark hooded bubble style jacket with his hood up, denim jeans and brown boots.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Detective constable Gerry Hattie, of Wishaw CID</a> , said: “The victim was uninjured as a result of this incident but has been left shaken.</p>
      <p>“We are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time of the robbery or may have seen a man matching this description.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who has any information can contact Police Scotland on 101 quoting incident number 2572 of 3 November 2019."</p>
