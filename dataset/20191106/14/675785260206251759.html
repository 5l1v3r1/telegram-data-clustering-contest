      <p>A father-of-two was hit on the neck by a wayward rocket during a mini fireworks display at his Birmingham home.</p>
      <p>Neil Sjollema, from Shenley, Herts, set off a pack of fireworks - including a Roman candle, wheel, mines, aerial shot tubes, rockets, multi-shots, and fountains - in his garden over the Bonfire Night weekend.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old was filmed backing away before the fireworks exploded on the night of November 2, reports <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/moment-aldi-firework-backfires-dad-17209432">Birmingham Live</a> .</p>
      <p>But as building site manager Neil turns around to watch the display, one rocket flew directly at him and hit the right side of his neck.</p>
      <p>Children can be heard laughing hysterically while a woman shouts in the background: "Oh my God! S***! Kids, I think you better get in! Where are the kids?"</p>

      <p>Neil stayed near by the door as the group of ten - six children and four adults - watched the fireworks.</p>
      <p>He told Birmingham Live: "That was pretty funny looking back, there was an initial panic but it made for a fun night!</p>
      <p>"I had some friends and their kids over to have a mini firework display in the garden, after buying a set.</p>
      <p>"The whole thing literally went off with a bang - and then one of the rockets hit me!</p>
      <p>"It didn't hurt too much actually, as I think I was full of adrenaline and wanted to make sure the kids were safe.</p>
      <p>However the blast left Neil with a mark on his neck, which he called it 'a little souvenir'.</p>
      <p>He added: "It won't stop me trying again next year!"</p>

      <p>Neil claimed he bought the 16 pack of Wow Fireworks from Aldi supermarket.</p>
      <p>The description on the box says: "This 16 pack of fireworks does exactly what it says on the tinâ€¦wow! Featuring a variety of amazing effects including fountains, rockets, multi-shots and mines, these fireworks will certainly impress."</p>
      <p>It also comes with a warning which reads: "Always read firework instructions carefully before use."</p>
