      <h2>Mirror Motoring's Colin Goodwin looks at the new 1-Series BMW that is - shock, horror - front-wheel drive... and asks: 'Is it sacrilege, or a better car because of it?'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:12:14+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Goodwin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/colin-goodwin/</a></address>
      <p>BMW used to say proper cars driven by true enthusiasts should be rear-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>All through the late 1980s and 90s it produced adverts that said as much.</p>
      <p>And then in 2014 BMW launched the 2-Series Active Tourer.</p>
      <p>It was dull to drive and – horror – was front-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>Around about the same time BMW carried out some research and discovered that four out of five buyers of the 1-Series hatchback didn’t give a hoot that it was rear-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>So now we have a new 1-Series that is front-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>Sacrilege... or a better car because of it?</p>

        <figcaption>This hot version of the 1-Series is four-wheel drive</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>To me the 1-Series never made sense as a rear-wheel drive car. It was heavier than it needed to be and the packaging was poor because of the way the engines were mounted.</p>
      <p>I didn’t much like the look of it either.</p>
      <p>This new BMW 1-Series is based on the same platform as the Mini Clubman and ­Countryman, as well as family members the X1 and X2.</p>
      <p>The old 1-Series came with four and six-cylinder engines – the new car has a choice of three or four-cylinder units, diesel and petrol.</p>
      <p>There’s still a powerful version that’s called the 135i, powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged motor that produces 300bhp.</p>
      <p>This hot version of the 1-Series is four-wheel drive, as is the most powerful 120d model.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20824470.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_BMW-1-Series-BMW-118i-Model-Sportline05ed.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The 118i which, along with the 118d, is going to be the volume seller</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The 135i is a natural rival to Mercedes-Benz’s A35 and Volkswagen’s Golf R but we’re going to check out the 118i which, along with the 118d, is going to be the volume seller.</p>
      <p>In its M Sport trim it costs £26,715 but with the options loaded on to our test car it costs £37,500 – which is far too expensive.</p>
      <p>It looks considerably better than the old one. The proportions are neater and the grille, while not as domineering as some of BMW’s latest designs, looks dynamic.</p>
      <p>But the big change is inside. There’s now considerably more legroom at the back. You’ve got a quality ­interior with the option of more brighter colours than before.</p>
      <p>This BMW is going to be bought by younger customers.</p>
      <p>The dashboard doesn’t have the expanse of touch-screens available on a Mercedes A-Class but there’s still a wide range of tech, much of it optional.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20824469.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BMW-1-Series-BMW-118i-Model-Sportline13.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>But the big change is inside the car</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Our car has the digital instrument panel option that’s part of the Technology Pack 2 (£1,500) but I’d do without it and stick with the standard, very easy to read (unlike the digital instruments), analogue circular dials. I’d also skip the pointless gesture control.</p>
      <p>One option that is interesting is the Touring fuel tank. It adds an extra eight litres of fuel capacity and costs only £50.</p>
      <p>Tick that box.</p>
      <p>The 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine in this 118i is shared with the Mini and other small BMWs. It’s powerful enough, smooth and economical.</p>
      <p>In our car it’s connected to the £1,350 dual-clutch automatic transmission. It’s a smooth and effective gearbox and I can’t see a reason not to order it if you ­anticipate lots of town driving.</p>
      <p>I’m going to ask a non-petrolhead friend who’s owned a 1-Series for quite a few years if she knows whether her car is front or rear-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>I’ll bet she doesn’t.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20824468.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_BMW-1-Series-BMW-118i-Model-Sportline11ed.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Some of the options are well-worth considering</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On that car it was only really obvious on the very high-powered models.</p>
      <p>And you can’t tell that this new small BMW is front-wheel drive.</p>
      <p>The engineers have done an excellent job of removing any vices such as torque steer and the 1-Series corners accurately.</p>
      <p>In other words, the enthusiasts will be happy.</p>
