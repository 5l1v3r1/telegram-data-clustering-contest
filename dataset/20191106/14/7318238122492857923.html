      <p>Violent clashes between security forces and demonstrators broke out in the early hours of Wednesday morning in Bolivia's capital.</p>
      <p>Sporadic and intense demonstrations have gripped Bolivia following a disputed October 20 election.</p>
      <p>Opponents challenge an official count that showed incumbent Evo Morales winning with 47% of the vote and a margin of just over 10 percentage points over his nearest competitor â€” enough to avoid the need for a runoff against a united opposition.</p>
      <p>Riot police guarding access to an area surrounding the presidential palace clashed with Morales opponents as they tried to march on the building.</p>
      <p>Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, has accused the opposition of trying to stage a coup d'etat.</p>
      <p>The Organization of American States sent a team to Bolivia and began a "binding" audit of the election.</p>
