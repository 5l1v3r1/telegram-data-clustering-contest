      <p>A drug dealer arrested shortly after stepping off a flight at Birmingham Airport has been jailed after police found almost £50,000-worth of heroin in a car.</p>
      <p>Zaoheb Iqbal, from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/coventry">Coventry,</a> had just returned from Pakistan when police made the arrest.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old was first spotted running from Springfield Road, Foleshill in December last year, where officers stopped a Peugeot 307.</p>
      <p>The car was found to contain a huge stash of heroin with an estimated street value of £48,000.</p>

      <p>The occupants of the car were arrested and charged, but police say officers were set on convicting Iqbal.</p>
      <p>Iqbal was arrested, but officers had to release him when a search found he had nothing on him.</p>
      <p>But officers then retraced his steps and found a set of keys to a parked car he had been standing next to.</p>
      <p>A search then uncovered over £18,000 in cash and two mobile phones in the footwell.</p>

      <p>One of the phones was linked to Iqbal and contained records of calls to the driver of the Peugeot.</p>
      <p>Further calls linked him to a drugs seizure with a street value of over £50,000 in Villa Road the month before.</p>
      <p>Iqbal, from Ransom Road, was arrested at the airport after returning from Pakistan and pleaded guilty at the start of his trial at Birmingham Crown Court on October 28.</p>
      <p>He has now been jailed for a total of nine years for conspiracy to supply class A and class B drugs.</p>
