      <p>LONDON, Nov 6 — A second man pleaded guilty today to trying to rob Arsenal stars Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac of their watches in a moped ambush.</p>
      <p>Jordan Northover, 26, admitted trying to steal the expensive items from the Premier League footballers in northwest London on July 25, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Ashley Smith has already pleaded guilty to his role in the attempted raid involving close friends Ozil, 31, and Kolasinac, 26.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage spread widely on social media showed burly Bosnian defender Kolasinac, nicknamed “The Tank”, chasing off the two moped attackers, who were wearing helmets and dark clothing.</p>
      <p>German midfielder Ozil can be seen in his black Mercedes G class 4x4 before he reportedly took refuge in a Turkish restaurant.</p>
      <p>World Cup winner Ozil and full-back Kolasinac were left out of Arsenal’s squad for their opening Premier League game but have since returned.</p>
      <p>Ozil told the Athletic website in October that his main concern at the time was his wife Amine’s safety. </p>
      <p>“They told him (Kolasinac) directly, ‘Give us your watch’. Sead’s reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers,” Ozil said in the interview.</p>
      <p>“The second one was in front of my car on his moped so I couldn’t drive.</p>
      <p>“We were newly wed and I was scared about my wife. I was scared about Sead. I wasn’t thinking about myself. I was worried they were going to open my wife’s door and they tried, so I reached across her to keep it closed.” — AFP</p>
