      <p>“The ministry is doing a lot of interventions, we are dealing with over 500 secondary schools and we will make a lot of investments in improving infrastructures, improving quality of the teachers</p>
      <p>“We have also made adequate provisions to move Kaduna State University from the current site to its permanent site along Zaria road.</p>
      <p>“We have also budgeted adequately to complete the six science secondary schools we are building; we are also taking another 16 secondary schools that will be fully made into boarding schools.</p>
