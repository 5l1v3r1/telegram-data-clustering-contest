      <h1>Unai Emery confirms extent of Dani Ceballos injury after midfielder limped off with hamstring problem</h1>
      <h2>The Spaniard was replaced by Matteo Guendouzi on 54 minutes after pulling up with the injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T20:30:55+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery has allayed fears that Dani Ceballos could be set for a spell on the sidelines by saying the hamstring injury he picked up against Vitoria was a 'small' one.</p>
      <p>Ceballos was substituted shortly after he pulled up clutching his hamstring early in the second-half of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/vitoria-1-1-arsenal-5-20826531">Gunners' 1-1 draw with Vitoria</a> in the Europa League on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>This led to worries from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans, who thought the player could be out for a number of weeks.</p>
      <p>Ceballos is set to have tests on the injury on Thursday but it looks hopeful he will not be out for a significant period of time, although he could miss his side's trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the game Emery said: "We are going to wait for the analysis tomorrow but, at the beginning, I think it's a small injury."</p>
      <p>Ceballos has become a fans' favourite at the Emirates, making 15 appearances in all competitions since his loan move from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , but he could not help inspire his side to a victory against Vitoria as the Portuguese side scored a last minute equaliser.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BT Sport, Emery added: "The players worked and tried and we were very close to winning. In the last minute, they pushed a lot and they scored.</p>
      <p>"The objective is to be first in the group and we are. At the end of the match, we're thinking about Saturday and Leicester.</p>

      <p>"We tried [to score] but also they are a very competitive team. We did better defensively. Offensively, this team are very organised and it's not easy to have a lot of chances. It's not good because we want to win but we are first, and this is our target."</p>
      <p>Arsenal travel to Leicester hoping to win their first Premier League game since the 1-0 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on 6 October.</p>
