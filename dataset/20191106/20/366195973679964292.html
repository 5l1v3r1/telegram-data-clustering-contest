      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/southside/profile">Southside</a> is the man behind some of the biggest records that have dropped this decade. He's had a major hand in molding the sound of trap music to what it is today. Aside from being a hitmaking producer, he's also a rapper. He's released projects under the name Young Sizzle but now, he's released a brand new EP under his producer name, even though he takes the seat as a rapper. He delivers three hard-hitting bangers on this record while allowing Pyrex Whippa to hold down the production. They make an incredible pairing and hopefully, this results in more collaborations from the two.</p>
      <p>Pyrex Whippa's had a major year in 2019. He produced two tracks on <i>Revenge Of The Dreamers 3</i>, as well as songs from <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/offset/profile">Offset</a>, <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Da-Baby/profile/">DaBaby</a>, and more.</p>
