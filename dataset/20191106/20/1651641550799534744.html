      <h1>Microsoft confirms Edge is coming to Linux</h1>

      <p>Microsoft has been teasing Edge for Linux for some time now, and in <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/the-chromium-based-microsoft-edge-may-be-coming-to-linux/">September even ran a survey</a> asking amongst other things if there was a demand for the browser there.</p>
      <p>Edge is already available on iOS, Android, Mac, Windows 10 and Windows 7. Now at Ignite 2019 Microsoft explicitly confirmed Edge for Linux is coming in the future.</p>

      <p>Having the browser available on the open-source operating system would make it easier for developers using the operating system to create web sites and web apps which are Edge-compatible, making it an advantage for Microsoft despite the rather small potential audience.</p>
      <p>It is not clear when “the future” is, but it appears likely it will be after the new Edge for Windows will exit beta.</p>
