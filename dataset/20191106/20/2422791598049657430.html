      <p>MONTREAL - Re-elected federal Liberal Dominic LeBlanc has been discharged from a Montreal hospital following a successful stem cell transplant.</p>
      <p>LeBlanc said in a statement today he is feeling stronger and looking forward to returning to New Brunswick, where he captured the riding of Beausejour for the seventh consecutive time Oct. 21.</p>
      <p>He stepped aside from his duties as minister of intergovernmental and northern affairs in April after being diagnosed with a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer.</p>
      <p>After receiving chemotherapy in Moncton, N.B., LeBlanc was transferred to a Montreal hospital in September for the transplant.</p>
      <p>He says he was discharged from hospital Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>LeBlanc's hematologist is quoted in the statement saying the transplant went well with no unusual complications, and the MP's immune system should continue to strengthen over the coming weeks.</p>
