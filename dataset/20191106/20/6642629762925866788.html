      <p>United States President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> said on Wednesday he held successful talks with officials from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ethiopia.html">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/sudan.html">Sudan</a> over a new dam being built on the Nile river.</p>
      <p>Trump was mediating in a dispute over Ethiopia's construction of the huge dam which Egypt says could drastically disrupt the Nile, the river providing 90 percent of the country's drinking water.</p>

      <p>Ethiopia says the five-billion-dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam near the border with Sudan will be a massive boost to the economy and is necessary to provide much-needed electricity.</p>
      <p>However, the Egyptians fear the move would be at its expense, and reduce its share of Nile water.</p>
      <p>Last month, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told Parliament, in reference to the dam, that, "If we are going to war ... we can deploy many millions".</p>
      <p>Egypt slammed his strident comments as "unacceptable".</p>
      <p>Abiy, who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to heal tensions with neighbouring <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/eritrea.html">Eritrea</a>, emphasised however that negotiations would be the best way to resolve the issue.</p>
      <h3>Outside mediation</h3>
      <p>A US official said in October that President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abdel-fattah-el-sisi.html">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> had asked Trump to get involved in the dispute when they met in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.</p>
      <p>The Nile is a lifeline supplying both water and electricity to the 10 countries it traverses.</p>
      <p>Its main tributaries, the White and Blue Niles, converge in Sudanese capital Khartoum before flowing north through Egypt to drain into the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
      <p>Analysts fear the three Nile basin countries could be drawn into a conflict if the dispute is not resolved before the dam begins operating. It is scheduled to go online by 2022.</p>
      <p>Discussions between the three countries broke down this year prompting Egypt to call for international mediation last month.</p>
      <p>Sisi recently described Trump as being of "unique standing with the power in dealing with conflicts ... and finding crucial solutions for them".</p>
