      <h2>A Good Samaritan rescued a Rhode Island dog that wound up stranded on the roof of a home, according to a video of the incident.</h2>

      <p>The unidentified Good Samaritan climbed onto the roof of the home after neighbors noticed the dog pacing back and forth on the roof of the house, WJAR <a href="https://www.wtoc.com/2019/11/05/watch-man-rescues-dog-roof-home/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Neighbor Daylue Goah said the dog’s owner was initially not home at the time the dog made it onto the roof.</p>
      <p>“When I saw the animal control car, I’m like, ‘Okay, help is finally here’. Then, when they left again, I’m like, ‘Oh, my God. He’s being left alone,’” Goah told WJAR.</p>
      <p>Moments later, a Good Samaritan and the dog’s owner arrived at the scene to get the dog off the roof.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/video/622508">video</a> shows the unidentified man trying to coax the dog into his arms before leading him to the sunroof to rescue the dog and pass him along to his owner.</p>
      <p>“Good job, good job,” someone could be heard saying over the video.</p>
      <p>This is not the first heroic dog rescue to take place in the past few weeks. Over the weekend, a man <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/local/2019/11/06/man-saves-caged-dog-floating-freezing-lake-plans-adopt/">saved</a> a caged dog floating in a freezing lake in Illinois. He not only rescued the dog but plans to adopt it when it is fully rehabilitated.</p>
