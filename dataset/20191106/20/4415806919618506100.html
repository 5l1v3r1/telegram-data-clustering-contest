      <p>Passengers and crew were removed from a plane at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport during a major security alert, after a hijacking alarm was activated by mistake.</p>
      <p>The military police service earlier said they were responding to a suspicious situation at the airport on the outskirts of Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Dutch media reported that emergency services were deployed in large numbers tonight.</p>

      <p>But Air Europa later tweeted that it had been a false alarm.</p>
      <p>They said that a warning that triggers protocols on hijackings at the airport was activated by mistake.</p>
      <p>“Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and sound waiting to fly soon. We deeply apologize,” they tweeted.</p>
