      <p><b>WESTBOROUGH, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Amazon says it plans to open a $40 million robotics innovation hub west of Boston.</p>
      <p>The technology giant said Wednesday the complex will open in 2021 in Westborough, Massachusetts. Amazon says the expansion will create about 200 tech and advanced manufacturing jobs.</p>
      <p>Amazon says it has created more than 4,000 full-time jobs in Massachusetts and has invested over $3 billion in the state since 2011.</p>
      <p>Tye Brady is Amazon Robotics' chief technologist. He says the new hub will be a place where robots are designed, built, programmed and shipped.</p>
      <p>Amazon's robotics division has been focused on making warehouse robots that stack and move goods at its distribution centers.</p>
      <p>Massachusetts has been the center for Amazon's robotics research since the company acquired North Reading-based Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012.</p>
