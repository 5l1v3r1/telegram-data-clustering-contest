      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/harry-potter-emma-watson-single-self-partnered">Emma Watson</a>'s life completely changed when she landed the role of Hermione Granger in the "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jk-rowling-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-movie-hint">Harry Potter</a>" <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">movie</a> franchise.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/why-emma-watson-wont-take-selfies-with-fans">actress</a>, now 29, was just nine years old when she was picked out of a line-up in her school gym to audition and she revealed in a candid interview with British Vogue that she "struggled" being a child star.</p>
      <p>"I've sat in therapy and felt really guilty about it," Watson told Paris Lees. "I'm like, 'Why me? Somebody else would have enjoyed and wanted this aspect of it more than I did.'"</p>

      <p>"And I've struggled with ... I've wrestled a lot with the guilt around that. I'm like, 'I should be enjoying this a lot more, I should be more excited and I'm actually really struggling,'" she added. "It's so bizarre and otherworldly what happened to me."</p>

      <p>Watson admitted that her family and her "roots" have kept her grounded: "Part of what's helped me find peace is there were moments when it got so big where I almost had vertigo and felt it got so big that I felt l disconnected, and part of the peace within myself is remembering my identity."</p>

      <p>"There's a whole big existence and identity that I have that's really important and weighted and solid, that has nothing to do with any of that," she said.</p>

      <p>Watson also spoke about the anxiety she feels going out in public places, saying she sometimes puts on disguises to blend in with large crowds.</p>
      <p>"Halloween is great for me," she joked. "I can be anybody."</p>
