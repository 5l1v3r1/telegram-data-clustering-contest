      <p>BEIJING: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday (Nov 6) that he told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that dialogue, restraint and a "de-escalation" were needed in Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>Macron said he raised the issue with Xi "on several occasions" during his official visit to China - ignoring prior warnings from Beijing that sensitive topics such as Hong Kong should not be on the agenda.</p>

      <p>"I obviously conveyed our concerns, which are shared by Europe," Macron said at a news conference at the French embassy.</p>
      <p>"We called on several occasions for dialogue ... restraint," he said, adding that he called for "de-escalation through dialogue."</p>
      <p>The international finance hub has been convulsed by five months of huge and increasingly violent protests calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Beijing has repeatedly accused "foreign forces" of fuelling the unrest in the semi-autonomous city, a former British colony that was returned to China in 1997.</p>
