      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Nearly $150 million was spent on mineral exploration for primarily large mine opportunities in Alaska last year.</p>
      <p>The Alaska Journal of Commerce reported Wednesday that figure is up from just more than $50 million in spending three and four years ago.</p>
      <p>The Alaska Department of Natural Resources says mineral exploration spending reached a peak of $350 million per year in the late 2000s.</p>
      <p>Curt Freeman of Fairbanks-based Avalon Development Corp. says there were 18 large exploration projects across the state for “every metal under the sun.”</p>
      <p>Freeman says Alaska’s six metal mines are all large operations and the state does not have a mid-sized mine.</p>
      <p>An official says the Alaska Mental Health Trust Land Office is exploring a growing heavy mineral prospect on the Gulf of Alaska coast.</p>
