      <p>(CNN) - Put down the turkey baster. Empty your cabinets of cranberry sauce. While you're at it, just forgo cooking entirely and stuff your cornucopia full of chips.</p>
      <p>Pringles has unveiled a seasonal food-flavored chip feast, and it's poised to replace the whole Thanksgiving spread.</p>
      <p>Two words: Turducken. Pringles.</p>
      <p>No, no, it isn't a chicken chip stuffed inside of a duck chip crammed inside of a turkey chip. There are three individual flavors, so it's up to the snacker to determine the order.</p>
      <p>Pringles Frankenfood-ed a preexisting Frankenfood! Is there a line? If so, does this cross it?</p>
      <p>That's not all: In an concept seemingly swiped from Willy Wonka, Pringles made chips to replace Thanksgiving's signature side dishes. There are cranberry sauce-flavored chips. Stuffing chips. Pumpkin pie chips.</p>
      <p>Yep, we get pumpkin spice Pringles now, too.</p>
      <p>They're all part of Pringles' "Friendsgiving Feast Turducken Kit," but what kind of friend would you be offering guests who expected a hearty meal a bowl of meat-flavored chips instead?</p>
      <p>For the brave of spirit and stomach, the kit goes on sale Thursday in the Kellogg's online store.</p>
      <p>For just $15.99, you can taste for yourself whether the chips are an offense to Thanksgiving or Pringles is just ahead of its time.</p>
