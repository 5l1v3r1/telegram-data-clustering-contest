      <p>These days, it feels like just about every actor is signing a Marvel contract. And the studio has continued to nab huge names such as Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek coming to the <i>Eternals</i> or <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481304/how-wesley-snipes-feels-about-the-mahershala-ali-blade-casting">Mahershala Ali starring in MCU’s <i>Blade</i></a>. In light of Taron Egerton’s incredible performance as Elton John in <i>Rocketman</i> and role in the <i>Kingsman</i> movies, rumors punctured around the actor <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479000/what-taron-egerton-could-look-like-as-mcu-wolverine">taking on the mantle of Wolverine in the MCU next</a>. The 29-year-old actor has had to clear up the exciting chatter a few times over the past few months. Check out what he recently said about them:</p>
      <blockquote>It's unfounded. The only morsel of truth to it is that I'm a huge fan of the films, like 99.9 percent of the rest of the world. That is kind of all there is to it, really. … I don't quite know where it comes from. I'm flattered but baffled by it... There's other characters that I think I'd be more suited to.</blockquote>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is no truth to Taron Egerton playing the role of Wolverine in the Marvel Universe following his <i>Eddie the Eagle</i> co-star Hugh Jackman at this time. The <i>Rocketman</i> actor is a huge fan of the franchise, he certainly doesn’t want to give them false hope. The rumor seems to have been founded on fan-casting (and a well done one, at that). It interested so many, it became viral. Since, Egerton hasn’t been shy about his interest in being a part of the MCU in general, he poses their might be other characters he could play instead!</p>
      <p>There’s thousands of Marvel characters in canon and the studio isn’t slowing down anytime soon, with a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483527/buckle-up-the-mcu-will-keep-releasing-three-to-four-movies-a-year">planned three to four movies to be released each year</a> and the new Disney+ platform adding television shows to the MCU. Taron Egerton has certainly proved his talent over the past few years, taking on a massive <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482185/yes-kingsman-3-already-has-a-script">action role as Eggsy in the <i>Kingsman</i> movies</a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478961/rocketmans-taron-egerton-spent-a-ton-of-time-learning-piano">challenging himself with the role of Elton John in <i>Rocketman</i></a>. He could certainly find a place in the vast comic book universe.</p>
      <p>But once you imagine Taron Egerton as Wolverine, there’s no going back. He’d be a great choice. The actor is closer to the height of comic book character, who is actually supposed to be a lot shorter than Jackman’s over-six-foot character was. The actor can’t deny how great of a role it would be either. He continued with these words to <a href="https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/taron-egerton-wolverine-mcu-hugh-jackman-xmen-111904863.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLzdMbjNuUU5BS0g&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC6OmP_yG33iQj8H8QYUaFZ-RGnjxQaBKUYo8v2ayCnPfuxWQ8_g6ki1i177SnSYpcwc60oUzYh8SzXdgRgp0ZIApcrcMvNGbziHT3pmJrpcWD0chCKzbJZGDCawc_bBg7dLYY7_l3s5pE92Yl1GVnVmE_-wZE6-FZXw4vvL2c02&amp;guccounter=2">Yahoo</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>If there's one you want to play, it's probably that one. I love the wildness of Logan, but I don’t know… If the phone rang, I would be of course very, very open to it. But, there’s no truth to [the rumors].</blockquote>
      <p>Catch Taron Egerton waiting by the phone? The truth of the matter is Hugh Jackman’s 17 years as Logan is almost an impossible act to follow. While an X-Men reboot in the universe is coming sometime down the line, I wouldn’t imagine Kevin Feige is jumping at <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480475/x-mens-wolverine-5-actors-perfect-for-the-role-in-the-inevitable-mcu-reboot">rebooting Wolverine</a> so soon. So Egerton’s apprehension over Wolverine makes perfect sense. He sounds like he wants to be in the MCU conversation but doesn’t want to be counted out of other opportunities.</p>
      <p>What do you think? What role in the MCU can you imagine Taron Egerton taking on… besides Wolverine? Sound off in the comments below.</p>
