      <p>KINGS BEACH, Calif. - Sheriff's deputies in Northern California have helped a massive dumpster-diving bear get out of a sticky situation.</p>
      <p>Placer County sheriff's deputies found the bear trapped Monday in a locked trash bin in Kings Beach, on Lake Tahoe's northern shore.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PlacerSheriff/videos/429445584640938/">Video the agency posted to Facebook </a>shows a deputy shining a flashlight on the dumpster and the bear suddenly popping its head out. As the startled deputy jumps back, others laugh and say "whoa!"</p>
      <p>They recognize it as the bear they've dubbed "T-Shirt" for a patch of white fur on its chest. The agency says the animal has had run-ins with deputies before.</p>
      <p>They unlock the dumpster from a distance and fling open one of the doors. The bear is stuck in a smaller opening in the top of one of the doors, but eventually drops down, pushes it open and lumbers out.</p>
