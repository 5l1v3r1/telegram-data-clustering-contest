      <p>Vivo has released a poster announcing it will hold a Vivo &amp; Samsung launch joint event in Beijing on November 7th. You can see the invite attached below with the clear hints that the launch has got something to do with a 5G VIVO smartphone, powered by the<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/exynos-980/"> Exynos 980 SoC</a> from Samsung. Perhaps, the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/06/16/vivo-x30-and-y19-monikers-spotted-in-trademark-filing/">Vivo</a> X30 will be the event’s main highlight.</p>
      <p>Other than that, the <a href="http://news.mydrivers.com/1/655/655719.htm">invite</a> doesn’t explicitly reveal information about the product that would be launched. However, we have known for a while now that the Chinese firm will be unveiling a 5G smartphone – the Vivo X30 powered by Samsung’s Exynos 980 5G SoC. Earlier rumored to arrive at an unknown date in December, a report from the last days of October revealed the VIVO X30 might actually be the star product at Vivo’s and Samsung joint AI event on November 7th.</p>

      <p>The Exynos 980 is the first mid-range chipset with an integrated 5G modem. It’s an 8nm chip featuring 2x Cortex-A77 cores plus 6 x A55 cores. Furthermore, it counts with the Mali-G76 MP5 GPU and features an NPU. Worth noting that using an integrated 5G modem is a cheaper solution since they’re built-in the motherboard. Also, they are more power-efficient to boot, reducing the overall energy consumption. Notably, the SoC supports both NSA (non-standalone) and SA (standalone) 5G dual-mode networks.</p>
      <h3>VIVO X30 Specs</h3>
      <p>Not much else has been revealed about the Vivo X30, though there are reports it will come fitted with a triple rear camera setup, and a notch-less display – all thanks to its pop-out mechanism at the top. Given it will come with the Exynos 980 chipset, the X30 is likely to come only in 5G version, with no option for a 4G variant. The Vivo and Samsung joint event is only a few hours away, perhaps more information related to the event will be in the opening in the coming hours.</p>
