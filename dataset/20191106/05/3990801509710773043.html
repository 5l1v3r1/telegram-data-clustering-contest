        <i>(Update 07/11/2019 9.45 IST): According to a report by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/xerox-planning-a-cash-and-stock-offer-for-pc-and-printer-maker-hp-wsj.html">CNBC</a>, Xerox has made a cash-and-stock offer to HP for the takeover. HP also confirmed yesterday it held talks with Xerox executives regarding the deal. </i>

      <p>As per a report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/xerox-considers-takeover-offer-for-hp-11573012201?mod=rsswn">the Wall Street Journal</a>, Xerox is considering buying personal computers and printer manufacturer HP in a cash-and-stock deal.</p>
      <p>The report notes Xerox, valued at $8 billion, has backing from a major bank to take over HP, valued at $27 billion – almost three times more than the former. Sources told WSJ the deal will end up saving $2 billion in costs for both corporations.</p>
      <p>Just to remind you, HP is now a different company from Hwellet Packard Enterprise, which sells servers, data storage, and services to companies.</p>
      <p>Xerox is set to gain $2.3 billion by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/xerox-agrees-to-sell-25-of-fuji-xerox-for-2-2-billion-dj-says">selling its 25 percent stake</a> in the Fujifilm Xerox joint venture; the deal came to light earlier this week.</p>
