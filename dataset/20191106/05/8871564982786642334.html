      <h1>Step Right Up! Uncle Ringo’s high-flying circus coming to Marina Bay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T05:18:22+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 05:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Daredevils, gravity-defying acrobats and flying ballerinas from around the world will converge on Singapore to celebrate the final days of 2019.</p>
      <p>Singaporeans can always trust Uncle Ringo to put on the best carnivals, and this year, the organizer’s stepping things up with a show featuring a world-renowned circus. Uncle Ringo, the organizer behind many neighborhood funfairs known from many childhoods, has roped in international talents from the Great Circus of Europe troupe for a massive carnival at the Bayfront Event Space in Marina Bay from Dec. 20  to Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>Expect heart-racing stunts by circus pros from places such as Kazakhstan, Romania, and Kenya. Four Colombian daredevils will jump, skip, and vault in giant rotating wheels for a show called <i>Space Wheel </i>before hopping onto motorbikes for a proper Globe of Death at speeds of upward of 70kph. </p>

      <p>If that’s not enough to get the adrenaline pumping, check out another motorbike act by The Skyriders, who will take their two-wheelers onto a wire 7 meters above the ground.</p>
      <p>Other acts to look out for are aerial performances, including those by acrobats from The Serik Brothers, who will be suspended 13 meters up.</p>
      <p>If a bunch of flying ballerinas is what you fancy, there’s also an aerial ballet act by Duo Nava to check out.</p>
      <p>Those catching the circus acts on New Year’s Eve will get to witness specially curated performances, the organizer said.</p>
