        <b>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in partnership with Northrop Grumman, is reportedly designing a sophisticated orbital technology that would allow the collection of enormous amounts of solar energy in space before beaming it down in concentrated form to remote US bases during military operations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The joint AFRL-Northrop Grumman project, so far worthy of over $100 million in research cash, is dubbed the Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstration and Research project (SSPIDR), <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/air-force/air-force-research-laboratory-looks-to-beam-solar-energy-from-space-1.605809">The Stars &amp; Stripes media outlet reported</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“Energy is a strategic enabler and potential vulnerability for our nation and our Department of Defence ... To ensure DOD mission success, we must <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201907251076358722-energy-revolution-how-solar-panels-are-becoming-affordable/">have the energy we need</a> at the right place at the right time”, Col. Eric Felt, director of AFRL’s Space Vehicles Directorate said, cited by Stars &amp; Stripes.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the demonstrations manager for the project, Maj. Tim Allen, cited by the media outlet, specialists are designing an elaborate system consisting of a constellation of satellites with solar panels consisting of about 10,000 square meters - almost the size of two football fields.</p>
      <blockquote>“This whole project is building toward wireless power transmission ... The beams are electronically <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201712041059663244-window-solar-panel/">steered so we can put them down</a> in specific locations and keep them steered there without having to turn some large array”, said Allen, cited by the media outlet.</blockquote>
      <p>Developers said that the project would not solely be used for military purposes.</p>
      <blockquote>“This technology was first looked at in the 1960s or so, and it wasn’t cost-effective then [...] Now we’re going down the route to building some experiments to find out if it is cost-effective. If we find that it is and we start producing this operational capability, I believe the commercial industry will be happy to mimic what we’re doing and start providing this power commercially and not just for the military”, Allen said, cited by Stars &amp; Stripes.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the SSPIDR developers, the technology <a href="https://sputniknews.com/environment/201710091058082152-puerto-rico-solar-technology-tesla/">would provide solar power</a> through weather, regardless of latitude, and regardless of day and night.</p>
