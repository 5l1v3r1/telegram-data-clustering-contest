      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T05:03:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 05:03</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>The alleged killer of British backpacker Grace Millane claims she died 'from rough sex by accident'.</p>
      <p>Grace, 22,Â  was travelling after finishing university but went missing in New Zealand, on December 1 last year.</p>
      <p>Police found her body inside a suitcase on December 9 in bushland just a few metres from a scenic drive in Auckland's Waitakere Ranges.</p>
      <p>Earrings and a small metal tag inscribed with the word "freedom" were found inside the suitcase.</p>
      <p>The accused, a 27-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared in an Auckland court today for the first day of his trial for murder, which he denies.</p>
      <p>He met Grace on the evening of December 1 through the dating app Tinder.</p>
      <p>The suspect's lawyer, Ian Brookie, told the jury Grace's death was 'an accident'.</p>

      <p>"Ms Millane died as a result of what they consensually engaged in," Mr Brookie said.</p>
      <p>"An act designed to enhance their sexual pleasure that went wrong and she died as a result."</p>
      <p>CCTV had filmed the pair kissing before heading to the man's hotel apartment, prosecutor Robin McCoubrey told the court.</p>
      <p>Mr McCoubrey said the defendant lied to police about what occurred when he was first interviewed, telling them he had simply met Grace "for a drink and then parted company".</p>
      <p>But he later told them they had engaged in rough sexual intercourse involving biting and hitting, Mr McCoubrey said.</p>

      <p>Mr McCoubrey said the crown's case was that Grace died in the accused's apartment from sustained pressure to the neck.</p>
      <p>Her body also showed bruising to her chest and upper arms, the court heard.</p>
      <p>"Only two people know what happened in that room," Mr McCoubrey told the court.</p>
      <p>"One of them can't tell us and the other one hasn't told the truth about what happened."</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said that in the hours after Gracedied, the defendant engaged in a number of internet searches, including "the hottest fire".</p>
      <p>"It's plain that Ms Millane is dead at that point," Mr McCoubrey said.</p>
      <p>"What (the defendant) is trying to do is find a place to dispose of her body."</p>

      <p>"He wasn't distressed or concerned by her death," Mr McCoubrey said, adding that the defendant then began searching pornographic websites.</p>
      <p>The Crown alleged the defendant broke off his internet search to take seven intimate photos of Grace's body.</p>
      <p>The defendant then resumed searching pornographic websites, before searching for "large bags near me" and "rigor mortis".</p>
      <p>Security footage showed the defendant later purchased a suitcase from a business in the city centre.</p>
      <p>"He contorted Ms Millane's body into that suitcase," Mr McCoubrey said.</p>
      <p>Evidence from the father of the victim, David Millane, was read to the court.</p>
      <p>He said "Gracie" was the youngest of three children and was close with her family.</p>

        <figcaption>Grace had been travelling the world after graduating</figcaption>

      <p>She had travelled to New Zealand from Peru as part of a year-long trip after finishing university.</p>
      <p>She had previously had boyfriends and had exhibited no mental or physical health problems, Mr Millane added.</p>
      <p>The defendant cried and blew his nose loudly as the father's evidence read to the court.</p>
      <p>Detective Evan England then began delivering his evidence, but proceedings were stopped after the defendant informed his counsel he was feeling unwell.</p>
      <p>A short recess was taken and the court cleared while the defence team went to speak with the accused.</p>

      <p>The defendant appeared pale as he returned to the courtroom and the session continued.</p>
      <p>Grace's parents, David and Gillian, attended court for the first day of the trial which is expected to last five weeks.</p>
      <p>The killing shocked New Zealand, where serious crime was once considered relatively rare and its cities and countryside considered safe.</p>

      <p>It also sparked intense debate about New Zealand's record on violence against women.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people held candlelight vigils after Millane's death in a national outpouring of grief.</p>
      <p>Previously, Prime Minister Jacinda Arden held back tears as she apologised to Grace's family on behalf of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
