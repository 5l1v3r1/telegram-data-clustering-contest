      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/12/norman-lear-one-day-at-a-time-c-v-r.html">ABC’s <i>Live in Front of a Studio Audience</i></a>, which, as the name suggests, recreates classic sitcoms in front of a live studio audience, will be <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/jimmy-kimmel-is-bringing-back-two-norman-lear-shows.html">back on December 18</a> with new episodes of <i>All in the Family </i>and <i>Good Times</i>. The special will feature holiday episodes, as we predicted <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/abc-orders-more-live-in-front-of-a-studio-audience-kimmel.html">back in August</a>. <i>All in the Family</i> was one of the shows featured in the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/all-in-the-family-the-jeffersons-live-review.html">debut of <i>LIFOASA</i></a><i> </i>back in May, which also included an episode of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/jamie-foxx-messed-up-on-live-tv-and-we-feel-so-alive.html"><i>The Jeffersons</i></a>. This time around, Kerry Washington will join as an executive producer alongside Jimmy Kimmel, Norman Lear, Justin Theroux, Brent Miller, and Will Ferrell. The debut of <i>LIFOASA </i>garnered huge ratings and an <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/norman-lear-becomes-oldest-ever-emmy-winner-for-live-special.html">Emmy win for Norman Lear</a>, who became the oldest-ever person to win an Emmy award. Casting announcements for the December episodes have not yet been announced.</p>
