      <p>"Bloomberg has conducted a survey of Tesla Model 3 owners," writes Slashdot reader <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/~Thelasko">Thelasko</a>. "Some of the most interesting data <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/autopilot.html">are responses to questions about Autopilot</a>." Here's an excerpt from the report: <i>We asked 5,000 Model 3 owners about their experience with the electric sedan that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says will lead the world into a new era of driverless transportation. [...] Six drivers claimed that Autopilot actually contributed to a collision, while nine people in the Bloomberg survey went so far as to credit the system with saving their lives. Hundreds of owners recalled dangerous behaviors, such as phantom braking, veering or failing to stop for a road hazard. But even those who reported shortcomings gave Autopilot high overall ratings. More than 90% of owners said driving with Autopilot makes them safer -- including most of the respondents who simultaneously faulted the software for creating dangerous situations. </i>Bloomberg also asked Model 3 owners about the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/">quality and reliability</a> of their vehicles, as well as the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/customer-service-battery.html#intro">service and charging</a>.</p>
