      <p>RIO DE JANEIRO: Mining giant Vale failed to report problems at a massive tailings dam in Brazil that could have averted its collapse, killing hundreds, a government agency said on Tuesday (Nov 5).</p>
      <p>The Jan 25 dam breach in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais spewed millions of tons of mining waste across the countryside, leaving 270 people dead or missing, and forcing Vale to suspend some of its operations.</p>

      <p>Internal Vale documents seen by investigators from the National Mineral Agency (ANM) show the mining company was aware of problems with a drainage system installed seven months before the disaster.</p>
      <p>On Jan 10 - two weeks before the dam ruptured - two devices measuring liquid pressure had reached emergency level.</p>
      <p>"The increase in pressure of the piezometers compromised the stability of the dam," ANM said in a statement.</p>
      <p>But Vale failed to report any of the problems to the agency.</p>
      <p>"If ANM had been correctly informed, it could have taken precautionary measures and forced the company (Vale) to take emergency actions that could have avoided the disaster," ANM said.</p>
      <p>In a statement Vale said it would not comment on the "technical decisions taken by its geotechnical team at the time."</p>
      <p>The company said it would wait for the "expert, technical and scientific conclusions on the cause of the dam rupture."</p>
      <p>The ANM report comes amid growing pressure on the global mining giant.</p>
      <p>Police said in September they have enough evidence to charge employees of Vale and its German auditor over false information used to certify the safety of the dam.</p>
      <p>It is up to prosecutors to decide whether to charge seven Vale workers, none of whom are senior managers, and six employees of TUV SUD.</p>
      <p>The TUV SUD employees include a German-based business development director, engineers and consultants who certified the dam's stability in 2018.</p>
      <p>That came after a judge ordered Vale to pay nearly US$3 million to the families of three victims of the tragedy.</p>
      <p>A separate court ruling in July ordered Vale to pay for all the damage caused by the disaster, without quantifying the amount of money.</p>
      <p>Brazil has since banned the construction of new upstream dams, which are cheaper but less stable than other types of tailings dams, and ordered the decommissioning of existing ones.</p>
      <p>ANM's damning accusations came on the fourth anniversary of the collapse of another tailings dam owned by a joint venture between Vale and the Anglo-Australian miner BHP.</p>
      <p>The failure of the Fundao tailings dam unleashed a torrent of nearly 40 million cubic metres of highly toxic mine sludge over areas of the Mariana district, also in Minas Gerais.</p>
      <p>The mud killed 19 people and flooded 39 towns, marking Brazil's worst environmental disaster.</p>
