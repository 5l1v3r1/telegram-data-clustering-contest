        <i>Police are hunting for a 49-year-old man who fled the scene of a fatal stabbing at a construction site in St Peters</i>
      </p>
      <p>A 76-year-old man is dead and a 33-year-old man is in a critical condition after a construction site stabbing in Sydney’s inner west, with police now hunting the alleged assailant.</p>
      <p>NSW police on Wednesday afternoon said they were searching for a 49-year-old construction worker who fled the scene of the stabbing at St Peters.</p>

      <p>Inspector Chad Deegenaars said the three men knew each other.</p>
      <p>“Police and ambulance on arrival found a 76-year-old man deceased and it appears a 33-year-old man was also suffering stab wounds,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Attempts to render first aid were made to both parties. Unfortunately, the 76-year-old man could not be revived.”</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old was taken to Royal Prince Alfred hospital in a critical condition and underwent surgery.</p>
      <p>Detectives don’t believe it was a random attack, Deegenaars said.</p>
      <p>“Our investigators are finding out what the disagreement was. What the motive was, we don’t know.”</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to the construction site on the Princes Highway about 1pm.</p>
      <p>The alleged attacker was described as Caucasian, 180cm tall and with a shaved head. He was wearing a high-vis yellow shirt and long blue work pants.</p>
      <p>Police have warned the public not to approach the man if they see him but to instead call triple zero.</p>
      <p>Sydneysiders were urged to stay away from the intersection of Short Street and the Princes Highway.</p>
      <p>Video from the scene, posted to Twitter, shows a number of men in high-vis clothing standing in an area roped off by crime-scene tape.</p>
