      <h1>What Women Want in a Short Term Relationship, According to Study</h1>
      <h2>What a Girl Wants in a Hookup (And Yes, Size Matters)</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T05:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.askmen.com/authors/christina_majaski" target="_blank">Christina Majaski</a></address>
      <p>Women can be a mystery to some men and figuring out what we want in a short-term relationship can make things even more difficult. Thankfully, some new survey data from a collab between the <a href="http://www.uni-goettingen.de/">University of Gottingen</a> and 68,000 users of female health app <a href="http://www.helloclue.com/">Clue</a> might be able to help.</p>

      <p>First, it probably shouldn’t surprise anyone that the anonymous women surveyed admitted that size matters. Surprisingly however, there was a strong preference for an average-sized penis rather than a giant one. That should take a little bit of the edge off, at least.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly (take a look around any major urban center these days), women are showing a notable interest in short hair paired with beards. Given the massive crush of 20-something and 30-something guys roaming the streets with tight fades and hipster beards, it looks like guys might have already picked up on this signal.</p>
      <p>Being hairy all over isn't that desirable, though, with the 1970s-era Tom Selleck or Burt Reynolds chest seemingly well out of fashion in the survey results. One thing that hasn’t changed much over the years though — it’s best for men to be taller than your potential date — nearly 90% of women said they preferred their hookup partner to be taller than them.</p>
      <p>Also, you might want to make sure to hit the gym if you want to be chosen for her next casual relationship. Only 10% of women said they preferred “a little extra” weight on their date, and that already discouraging number plummeted to a measly 1.6% of women who prefer a chubby suitor for something more casual.</p>
      <p>Women from different countries have wildly different standards and expectations, too. French and Italian women like their lovers to be experienced, passionate, and physically attractive. Ladies from Spanish-speaking countries are all about kindness and compassion when it comes to having a little fun between the sheets, and British and American women are the least fussy overall.</p>
      <p>With these bits of forbidden, sacred knowledge in mind, you may be better equipped to take on the jungle that is casual dating in the current year. Take a deep breath, a shot of apple cider vinegar, and get a full-priced salon haircut. The rest will apparently sort itself out, especially if you take some extra steps like shaving your chest.</p>
