      <p>Danity Kane may still be out here making moves as a trio, but Dawn Richard continues to press forward as a solo act. Since her days on <i>Making the Band</i> and touring the<a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/danity-kane-shock-fans-with-new-photo-that-shows-drastic-plastic-surgery-changes-news.84567.html"> world with her five-piece Diddy-crafted group, </a>Dawn has expanded her resum√©. She's not only been working in the music industry as a singer, songwriter, and producer, but she also works in fashion, animation, film, and television.</p>
      <p>The singer returns to the music front with a double single drop that she released this week that blends two tracks: "Slim Thicc (feat. Trakgirl)/Ay Papi (feat. Brooke Candy)." <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/danity-kane-gives-fans-total-control-over-their-setlist-for-interactive-live-show-news.82438.html">Dawn shared a sometimes NSFW accompanying visual </a>for the release that shows off both her dance moves and her fit frame. "Slim Thicc" has more of an island vibe while "Ay Papi" taps into more of a Latin hip hop-pop feel. Check it out and let us know what you think.</p>
