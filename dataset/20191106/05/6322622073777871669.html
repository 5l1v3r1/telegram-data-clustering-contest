      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): theedgemarkets.com highlighted five stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. One stock displayed positive momentum while four had negative momentum.</p>
      <p>The stock with positive momentum was :</p>
      <p>EG Industries Bhd - up one sen at 47.5 sen</p>
      <p>Stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>AT Systematization Bhd - up 0.5 sen at eight sen</p>
      <p>DGB Asia Bhd - up one sen at 17 sen</p>
      <p>Homeritz Corp Bhd - up one sen at 70.5 sen</p>
      <p>Velesto Energy Bhd - up three sen at 39 sen</p>
      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
