      <p>NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks paused on Tuesday (Nov 5) in record range on rising hopes over US-China trade talks as US services sector data topped expectations.</p>
      <p>The Dow mustered a narrow record for a second day in a row, while the S&amp;P 500 fell slightly and the Nasdaq was flat.</p>

      <p>Hopes that the United States and China will soon seal "phase one" of a trade agreement got another push Tuesday following a Wall Street Journal report that said the two sides could roll back prior tariff measures to finalize the agreement.</p>
      <p>Analysts also pointed to a report from the Institute for Supply Management that showed services sector activity rebounded in October from a three-year low in the prior month.</p>
      <p>"The headwinds we have are the obvious with the trade war but there's been some progress made on that front," said ISM's Anthony Nieves.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 30.52 points (0.11 per cent) to 27,492.63.</p>
      <p>The broad-based S&amp;P 500 dipped 3.65 points (0.12 per cent) to 3,074.62, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was little changed at 8,434.68.</p>
      <p>Dow member Boeing rose 2.0 per cent after Chairman David Calhoun gave a forceful vote of confidence in CEO Dennis Muilenburg and said the 737 MAX was on track to receive regulatory approval this year to return to service after two deadly crashes.</p>
      <p>Adobe jumped 4.3 per cent as it released sales and profit targets above expectations and offered a bullish outlook for the potential market for its cloud computing products.</p>
      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance advanced 2.6 per cent following a report that the drugstore chain has considered going private.</p>
