      <h1>Frank Lampard predicted Chelsea fightback at half-time in game of "madness"</h1>
      <h2>The Premier League were 4-1 down with less than 30 minutes remaining, but secured a point at Stamford Bridge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T05:47:12+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 05:47</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has revealed he predicted his team's stunning fightback during half-time of their Champions League draw against Ajax on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Blues were trailing last season's semi-finalists 4-1 with just 30 minutes remaining in the game but clawed their way back to secure a point at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>And things could have been even better for the Premier League club, who were denied a late winner by VAR in a chaotic encounter which also saw two own goals, two penalties and both Ajax centre-backs receive red cards.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>BT Sport</i> after the final whistle, Lampard said: "I can't explain the game.</p>
      <p>"For all the things that we might analyse, the goals we conceded, the madness of the game, we are here for entertainment I suppose.</p>

      <p>"Even though there were some nervy moments, some crazy moments, anyone who was watching that, anywhere, has to say it was an incredible game of football."</p>
      <p>Lampard continued: "Respect to Ajax, they're a great team. What a spectacle.</p>
      <p>"The two own goals were the story of our first half. I said to the lads at half-time, 'I think we're going to draw this, it could be 3-3 or 4-4, it could be 4-3 - we can win it'.</p>
      <p>"I just felt we were so in the game and we were short of just that last pass in the final third.</p>

      <p>"I just felt that we would build momentum and fortunately, we did."</p>
      <p>Ajax stormed into an early lead at Stamford Bridge when Tammy Abraham turned Quincy Promes' cross into his own net just two minutes into the game.</p>
      <p>Jorginho briefly put the hosts level from the penalty spot before the Dutch champions' restored their lead with a Promes header in the 20th minute and a Kepa Arrizabalaga own goal before half-time.</p>
      <p>Donny van de Beek appeared to put the game out of reach when he made it 4-1 ten minutes after the break, but Cesar Azpilicueta tapped in at the far post eight minutes later to start the comeback.</p>
      <p>Ajax boss Erik ten Hag then saw both Daley Blind and Joel Veltman dismissed in the space of 60 seconds for a second yellow and a handball respectively.</p>

      <p>Jorginho added his second goal of the game from the penalty spot before Reece James completed the turnaround three minutes later with a driven effort from a corner.</p>
      <p>Azpilicueta thought he had scored a winner late on, but VAR ruled out the effort after Abraham was seen to have handled the ball in the build-up.</p>
      <p>The draw leaves <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in a three-way tie with Ajax and Valencia a the top of Group H, with each side on seven points.</p>
      <p>Lampard's side travel to the Spanish side in their next game in the competition, who beat Lille 4-1, but face league <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in the league before then.</p>
