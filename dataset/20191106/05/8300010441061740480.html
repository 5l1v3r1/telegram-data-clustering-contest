      <p>COSTA MESA, Calif. (KABC) -- The Chargers have their minds on Oakland this week - not London.<br/><br/>As the players prepare to head north to face the Raiders for Thursday Night Football, the team's owner is denying reports they're considering a move across the pond.<br/><br/>Owner Dean Spanos told reporters Tuesday: "We're not going to London. We're not going anywhere. We're playing in LA. This is our home, and this is where we're planning to be for a long (expletive) time.<br/><br/>Spanos was reacting to a report in <a href="https://theathletic.com/1347540/2019/11/04/with-london-ready-for-an-nfl-team-the-chargers-have-been-discussed-as-a-possible-option/">The Athletic</a> that said the team and league officials could consider a move to London, given how challenging it has been to build up a fan base in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Players say they haven't talked about it much.<br/><br/>"It didn't really gravitate to my attention too much, or the players I don't think," said running back Melvin Gordon. "We talked about it for two seconds. It is what it is. It's fake news."<br/><br/>What is real news is the fact the Chargers haven't drawn fans like they expected when they relocated from San Diego three years ago.<br/><br/>They play in a smaller stadium built for soccer and every home game looks like a road game with the stands filled mostly by fans from the visiting team.<br/><br/>The Chargers did play a game in London last year, winning in front of over 80,000 fans.<br/><br/>But head coach Anthony Lynn is only focused on the here and now.<br/><br/>"I know there's nothing to it. It won't be a distraction," Lynn said.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the team's Twitter account also had some fun with the rumor, sending out a clip from "The Wolf of Wall Street":</p>
