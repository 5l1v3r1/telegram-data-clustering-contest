      <blockquote>"This is likely the work of the insurgents [...] This is one of the biggest attacks in recent times", Colonel Pramote Prom-in, a regional security spokesman said, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-insurgency/officials-say-at-least-15-killed-in-attack-in-thailands-restive-south-idUSKBN1XG03N">cited by Reuters</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, according to the media report.</p>
      <p>Muslim Malay separatists are reportedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201608121044210103-thai-police-bombings/">known to attack security personnel</a> and monks in the southern Thai provinces which they see as territories occupied by a Buddhist-majority state.</p>
      <p>The roots of the local conflict date back to the early 20th century, when the territory of the Pattani sultanate <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201801221060950574-thailand-market-blast/">became part of mostly Buddhist Siam</a> (former name of Thailand) and was separated into three provinces â€” Naranthiwat, Pattani and Yala.</p>
      <p>Since then, Muslim movements in these regions have repeatedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201609301045856570-thailand-south-blast-killings/">called for broader</a> autonomy and pushed for independence.</p>
