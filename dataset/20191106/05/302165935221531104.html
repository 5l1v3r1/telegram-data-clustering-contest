      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 6 — A Malaysian court handed a jail term of 34 months and a fine to a man who killed a cat by stuffing it into the dryer of a launderette, state news agency Bernama said, the first such conviction under a new animal welfare law.</p>
      <p>In yesterday's judgment, which the court stayed pending appeal, K. Ganesh, 42, was ordered to pay a fine of RM40,000 for his crime, captured in a closed-circuit television clip that went viral on social media last year.</p>
      <p>The grainy video showed a man hold open the dryer door as another pushed the cat in, before they turned on the machine and left.</p>
      <p>“I hope this sentence will serve as a lesson to the accused and the public to not be cruel to animals,” the <a href="http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1786520">agency</a> quoted the judge, Rasyihah Ghazali, as saying.</p>
      <p>Reuters could not immediately contact Ganesh or his lawyer to seek comment. Media said the lawyer, S. Muthuveeran, had sought a minimal sentence as it was Ganesh’s first offence and he was poor.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear why the men put the cat into the dryer or what had happened to the other man in the video. — Reuters</p>
