Menon joined Mindtree from AkzoNobel India. Prior to that he worked for over 20 years with Unilever in multiple roles in India, Singapore, Dubai and Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Menon joined Mindtree after his predecessor Jagannathan Chakravarthi quit. Menon was part of the core team that oversaw the transition after L&amp;T acquired 60.6% stake in Mindtree.</p>
