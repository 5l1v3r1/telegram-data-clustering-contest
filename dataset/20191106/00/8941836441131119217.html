      <p>DALLAS (AP) - Radek Faksa kept hanging around the net, and was rewarded with two goals and even more cuts and scrapes on his nose.</p>
      <p>Faksa doubled his season total with two goals off rebounds and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Dallas Stars</a> won for the seventh time in eight games, beating the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Colorado Avalanche</a> 4-1 Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>“I’m trying to go to the net every game,” he said. “Luckily, I got two bounces tonight. You have to be patient and you will get rewarded later on.”</p>
      <p>The cuts?</p>
      <p>“I just tried to hit one guy, and he turned and hit me with the elbow in the nose,” Faksa said. “That was just an accident.”</p>

      <p>Jason Dickinson scored in the first period and Corey Perry added a goal in the third for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>, which never trailed. Ben Bishop made 36 saves, 21 in the third period.</p>
      <p>J.T. Compher scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a>, 0-4-1 in their last five games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> has won four in a row to improve to 8-8-1 after beginning the season 1-7-1.</p>
      <p>Colorado lost replay challenges after the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>‘ first and third goals. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> contended that there was goalie interference on Dickinson’s goal, and that Faksa’s stick had broken before he scored his second goal. For losing the challenges, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> received six minutes in penalties.</p>

        <p>“On the second challenge, it hit Faksa’s stick, and you could see the stick break,” Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. “I challenged that when he touched the puck, there should’ve been a stoppage since he played the puck with a broken stick.”</p>
        <p>Faksa and the replay officials saw the play differently.</p>
        <p>“I tipped it back and then just saw the rebound, put it in,” Faksa said, “and after that I saw a broken stick. So, I was sure it was a good goal.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> coach Jim Montgomery has reunited Faksa and Andrew Cogliano with Blake Comeau, playing in only his third game because of an injury in the season opener.</p>
        <p>“I think that line of (Faksa), Cogliano and Comeau are excellent,” Montgomery said, “both games they’ve played here together and will continue to play.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> came out fast, taking the first 12 shots on goal and a 2-0 lead before Colorado’s Nathan MacKinnon shot from the left faceoff circle into Bishop’s pad at 16:23. The shot came during the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a>’s second power play.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>‘ first goal was all Dickinson. He was relentless in keeping the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> in their own end, took the puck away from Samuel Gerard and scored unassisted on a shot 19 seconds in.</p>
        <p>Faksa increased the lead to 2-0 at 5:46. He got his own rebound at the right side of the net and lifted the puck over and off the stick of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> goalie Philipp Grubauer, who stopped 34 shots.</p>
        <p>Colorado scored with 36 seconds left in the first, pulling within 2-1. Vladislav Kamenev dropped the puck for Compher high in the right circle, and he sent the puck just under the crossbar.</p>
        <p>Faksa’s second goal came on the power play at 10:54 of the second period.</p>
        <p>NOTES: Dallas D John Klingberg didn’t play in the third period because of a lower-body injury. … LW Roope Hintz (lower body), the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>‘ scoring leader, sat out the game. D Andrej Sekera missed his fourth straight game. Coach Jim Montgomery said Sekera hurt his chest, back, both hips and a knee when he crashed into the boards on Oct. 26. … Dallas LW Blake Comeau played in his 800th career game. … Dickinson’s goal was his first point this season. He had gone without a goal for 14 regular-season games dating to April 2. . Colorado rookie D Cale Makar received his team-leading 11th assist on Compher’s goal. C Nathan MacKinnon also had entered the game with 10 assists. … Colorado had season highs of eight power plays (0 for 8) and seven penalty kills (6 for 7). … The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>‘ seven power plays were a season high. The eight penalty kills tied their season-high eight from Oct. 6 at Detroit. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> has had to kill at least five penalties in each of the last three games, allowing only one goal in 18 penalty kills. … Faksa’s two-goal game was his first since March 25 at Winnipeg.</p>
