      <h1>People Are Posting Their Genitals on Reddit to Get STI Diagnoses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <p>Over the past year, the number of Reddit posts in which people post pictures of injuries and diseases to <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/googled-syphilis-symptoms-help-public-health-researchers-predict-new-cases">crowdsource medical advice</a> has just about doubled.</p>
      <p>That includes people with STIs, who are sharing pictures of their genitals so that the doctors — and armchair specialists — of Reddit can share their wisdom, <i><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/people-are-turning-to-dr-google-reddit-for-std-medical-diagnoses.html">CNBC </a></i><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/people-are-turning-to-dr-google-reddit-for-std-medical-diagnoses.html">reports</a>. The rising trend, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2753884?guestAccessKey=04d5272e-2067-4f91-b210-8fca1223cd20&amp;amp%3butm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp%3butm_medium=referral&amp;amp%3butm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp%3butm_content=tfl&amp;amp%3butm_term=110519">found in research</a> published in the journal <i>JAMA</i> on Tuesday, is correlated with an <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/stds-highest-rates">all-time high</a> in STD rates — a damning sign that access to medical care remains poor.</p>
      <p>Of the posts in the message board r/STD, a page on Reddit dedicated to discussion of sexual health, over half of posts were asking for help diagnosing genital ailments, according to the study.</p>
      <p>It’s good that people are finding a community that can help them with sexual health, an area of medicine that too often comes with social stigma. It’s possible to remain somewhat anonymous by making a new account on Reddit — known as a burner — and posting a picture that doesn’t reveal anything else.</p>
      <p>“This can overcome some of the embarrassment that might come with going to ask a doctor,” UC San Diego physician Eric Leas, who led the study, told <i>CNBC</i>.</p>
      <p>But there are already services that let people do the same thing without the risk of getting bad advice from someone on Reddit — apps like STD Triage or First Derm can <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/i-hired-an-online-dermatologist-heres-what-happened/">connect people</a> directly to doctors, letting them share pictures and get diagnoses or advice in return.</p>
      <p>Of course, those apps cost money and Reddit is free.</p>
      <p>“Social media was not built to deliver health care,” UC San Diego scientist and study co-author Alicia Nobles told <i>CNBC</i>. “Currently, we don’t know if STDs, or other health issues, can be accurately diagnosed online, especially since people’s requests vary in the information they provide.”</p>
