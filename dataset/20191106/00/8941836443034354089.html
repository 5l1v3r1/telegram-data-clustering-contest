      <p>DENVER (AP) - The Latest on Colorado’s statewide elections (all times local):</p>
      <p>11 p.m.</p>
      <p>A ballot measure that would legalize sports betting in Colorado is too close to call.</p>
      <p>Votes for and against Proposition DD were running nearly equal with more than 1.2 million ballots cast in Tuesday’s election.</p>
      <p>Republicans and Democrats in Colorado’s Legislature referred the measure to voters. It would allow sports betting and tax it to help fund a state water conservation plan.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>If approved, it would allow Colorado’s 33 casinos to offer in-person and online wagering on professional, collegiate, motor and Olympic sports in May.</p>
      <p>Voters rejected a measure to allow the state to keep excess tax revenue for schools and roads.</p>

        <p>Colorado voters have rejected a ballot measure asking if the state could keep tax revenue that otherwise would be refunded under limits set by the state constitution.</p>
        <p>Democrats who control the statehouse had referred the measure, called Proposition CC, to Tuesday’s ballot.</p>
        <p>Proposition CC asked if the state could keep revenue in those years when it has a surplus and is required to return that money to taxpayers.</p>
        <p>The revenue would have been allocated to transportation and transit, K-12 schools and higher education.</p>
        <p>Voters also are deciding whether to legalize sports betting in Colorado.</p>
        <p>10:24 a.m.</p>
        <p>A ballot measure to let state government keep rather than refund excess tax revenue and another proposition legalizing sports betting topped Colorado’s off-year election ballot Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Both measures were sent to the ballot by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorados-legislature/">Democrat-led Legislature</a>, in accordance with the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, a 1992 amendment to the state constitution that requires voter approval of any tax increases, bonding or revenue retention measures.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Proposition CC hope its passage would lead to the state investing billions of dollars in modernizing roads and schools to keep up with rapid population growth.</p>
        <p>Backers of Proposition DD, the bipartisan sports betting proposal, were counting on Coloradans’ previous willingness to approve “sin taxes” - in this case to bring sports gambling out of the black market and tax it to pay for water conservation.</p>
