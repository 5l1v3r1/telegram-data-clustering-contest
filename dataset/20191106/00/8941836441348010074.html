      <p>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a> is expanding its website on privacy with more explanations about its commitments, though its policies and practices aren’t changing.</p>
      <p>The new site Wednesday is part of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a>’s ongoing push to distinguish itself from data-hungry, advertising-fueled rivals such as Google and Facebook.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a>’s privacy website is mostly a users’ guide with papers on how to prevent apps and other third-party services from unnecessarily tracking users’ location and behaviors.</p>
      <p>The company’s actual privacy policy hasn’t changed.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Many of the new privacy enhancements were announced earlier as part of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a>’s iOS 13 software update for iPhones. Changes include the ability to sign in to third-party services with an Apple ID account rather than Facebook’s or Google’s, plus more notices and warnings about apps tapping location data.</p>
