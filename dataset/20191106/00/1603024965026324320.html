      <p>A blip in the rally, after rallying for 7 consecutive sessions in a row but the upside still remains intact, suggest experts.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P BSE Sensex closed above 40,200 while Nifty50 held onto 11900. The final tally on D-Street – the S&amp;P BSE Sensex fell 53 points to 40,248 while the Nifty50 closed with losses of 24 points to 11,917 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sectorally, the action was seen in telecom and FMCG space while profit-taking was seen in consumer durables, healthcare, capital goods, and metal index.</p>

      <p>In the broader market – the S&amp;P BSE Mid-cap fell 1.13 percent while the S&amp;P BSE Smallcap index was down 0.8 percent.</p>
      <p>On the macro front, activity in India's dominant services industry contracted for a second consecutive month in October due to muted demand, a private business survey showed on November 5, driving business optimism to a near-three year low.</p>
      <p>The big question in front of investors is --- have we topped out? Well, going by technical charts, there are signs of a slowdown in momentum but if the index manages to hold above crucial support levels such as 11880-11900, Nifty has a chance of hitting 12K.</p>
      <p>The rupee gained 8 paise to close at a fresh five-week high of 70.69 against the US dollar on Tuesday following foreign fund inflows and gains in Asian peers after the Chinese central bank cut interest rates.</p>
      <p>On the institutional front, FPIs were net buyers in Indian markets for Rs 473 cr while the DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 1593 cr, provisional data showed.</p>
