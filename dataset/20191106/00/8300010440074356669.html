      <p>HIGHLAND, Calif. (KABC) -- The 53-year-old operator of a Highland day care facility has been arrested on suspicion of willful cruelty to a child and false imprisonment, authorities said.<br/><br/>On Sunday evening, deputies from the Highland police station contacted the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Crimes Against Children Detail about an investigation involving a 5-month-old girl and a 1-year-old boy who attended Drinkard-Batiste Family Child Care, also known as Lullaby 24 Hour Childcare Private Preschool &amp; Infant Care, which has been a licensed business for over 20 years.<br/><br/>The two children were allegedly victims of child abuse and endangerment, the sheriff's department said in a statement.<br/><br/>Detectives responded to the day care facility in the 7000 block of Nye Drive on Monday afternoon and contacted its operator, Rosalind Drinkard-Batiste, authorities said.<br/><br/>"Following an extensive investigation," the news release said, Drinkard-Batiste was taken into custody and booked. Her bail was set at $100,000.<br/><br/>Drinkard-Batiste spoke to Eyewitness News by telephone about the allegations.<br/><br/>She said they stem from a disgruntled employee that she recently hired and had to write up on several occasions. She said she has turned over 15 videos to investigators that she believes will support her.<br/><br/>She believes investigators were misinformed about the situation and she believes she will be vindicated. She wouldn't elaborate on the nature of the allegations.<br/><br/>Neighbors also spoke up in her defense.<br/><br/>"She's not a bad person. She would never hurt a child or put a child in danger. Ever," said neighbor Ben Munoz.<br/><br/>"If I had my grandkids living here with me, regardless of this, I know her that well, I would still take my grandkids over there. Because I know her character."<br/><br/>Drinkard-Batiste's license does not show any violations or complaints on file against the daycare. The website for the facility states Drinkard-Batiste has over 34 years of childcare training and education, as well as child abuse background clearance through the Department of Justice.<br/><br/>But investigators, who did not release information on who reported the allegations, say they believe there may be additional victims.<br/><br/>"We're asking anyone who may have had their children being cared for at this home daycare facility to come forward if they feel that their children were a victim," sheriff's spokesperson Jodi Miller said.<br/><br/>A California Department of Social Services spokesperson said no action has been taken against the daycare's licensing, but the facility is currently non-operational.<br/><br/>Anyone with information about the case is urged to call sheriff's Detective Shaunna Ables 909-387-3615.</p>
