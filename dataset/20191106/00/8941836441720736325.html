      <h1>Review: No sophomore slump for country singer Luke Combs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">KRISTIN M. HALL</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luke-combs/">Luke Combs</a>, “What You See Is What You Get” (River House Artists/Columbia Nashville)</p>
      <p>Not many artists break out on their first record, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luke-combs/">Luke Combs</a> did it without much fanfare, dropping an album two years ago that has spent 50 weeks on top of Billboard’s country chart and tied the all-time record set by another country sensation, Shania Twain.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luke-combs/">Combs</a> has fed his rabid fan base with a deluxe re-release of his debut album and a five-song EP before putting out this sophomore record. As the title track suggests, “What You See Is What You Get,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luke-combs/">Combs</a> is speaking directly to a working class crowd with an average Joe attitude about his own life, even as he has become country music’s next big star.</p>
      <p>He has a creative flourish with vowel harmony in “Lovin’ On You,” stringing together similar sounding words in a syncopated style that’s a little like rapping, but slower. “I like a two-door old Ford, wood board back porch, three chords and the truth,” with an emphasis on the “or” sound.</p>
      <p>He twirls around words in his North Carolina drawl, like “Long neck, ice cold beer never broke my heart,” with his larger than life vocals matched with a stomping drum rhythm that sounds unique among so much smoothness of mainstream country melodies.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luke-combs/">Combs</a>, at the top of a new class of neo-traditionalists in country music, has clearly learned a lot about writing solid honky tonk boogies from studying the catalog of Brooks &amp; Dunn, who appear as featured guests on his song “1, 2 Many.”</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luke-combs/">Combs</a> really sounds akin to a top-notch vocalist like Chris Stapleton when he gets pensive, slows it down and lets his fully emotive vocal range take center stage. Two slower standouts on the 17-song set are “Dear Today,” a demo-tape reminder to himself to not take his time for granted, and “Even Though I’m Leaving,” a classic father-son story song about saying goodbye.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luke-combs/">Combs</a> should be less worried about a sophomore slump than making more room for all those platinum plaques.</p>
