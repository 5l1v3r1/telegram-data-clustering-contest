      <h1>US veteran ‘feeling whole’ year after penis transplant</h1>

      <p>More than a year after performing the world’s most extensive penis transplant, doctors say their patient has recovered and reports “feeling whole” again.</p>
      <p>The U.S. veteran lost both legs and his genitals from a blast in Afghanistan. Last year, Johns Hopkins University surgeons rebuilt the man’s pelvic region, transplanting a penis, scrotum and part of the abdominal wall from a deceased donor.</p>
      <p>Doctors described the procedure in a letter in Thursday’s New England Journal of Medicine, and said their patient, who hasn’t been identified, recovered sexual and urinary function.</p>
      <p>Only three other successful, but less complex, penis transplants have been reported, two in South Africa and one at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
