      <p>Coral Lytle, who will now have to register as a sex offender for life, wept as she was taken into custody in a Tulare, California courtroom.</p>
      <p>Family members of the victims, who were 14- and 15-year-old high school freshmen at the time of the crimes, lashed out at Lytle.</p>
      <p>“Your name will always be equated with being a sex offender and rapist, because that is what now defines you,” said one of the mothers of the victims in a statement <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/article236928058.html">obtained by the Fresno Bee.</a></p>
      <p>The crimes occurred in the fall of 2017. The victims were said to be boyfriends of Lytle's daughters.</p>
      <p>"Coral Lytle is a predator, and this office was prepared for years to tell that to a jury. While I am grateful that she will serve prison time and have to register as a sex offender, the sentence doesn’t reflect the lifetime impact she made on her victims," District Attorney Tim Ward told <a href="https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/tulare-woman-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison-and-lifetime-sex-offender-registration/">KSEE</a>.</p>
      <p>Lytle, a mother of four, plead no contest in October to 21 felony sex counts with the boys, according to <a href="https://abc30.com/tulare-woman-who-had-sex-with-daughters-teen-boyfriends-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison/5671399/">KFSN</a>. </p>
