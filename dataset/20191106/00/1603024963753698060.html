        <b>ICICI Direct's research report on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/computers-software/techmahindra/TM4">Tech Mahindra</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Tech Mahindra (TechM) reported a healthy performance on all fronts. The key highlights for the quarter were constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% QoQ (better than ours and Street estimates), record deal wins (increased 3.1x QoQ to US$1.5 billion) and growth in digital revenues (11.8% QoQ, 37.4% YoY). Digital now contributes 39.0% of overall revenues. The revenue beat was driven by the better-than-expected performance in the enterprise segment, which grew 4.8% sequentially.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>Further, considering most margin headwinds being absorbed in FY20E, we believe FY21E could witness EBIT margin expansion to 14.3%. Hence, we maintain our BUY recommendation with a revised target price of Rs 900/share.</p>
