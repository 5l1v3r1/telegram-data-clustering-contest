      <p>Jeremy Corbyn will pledge to end “in-work poverty” and the need for food banks if Labour wins power at the snap General Election.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader is using a speech in Telford, Shropshire, on Wednesday to insist the party will deliver “real change” and that he will be a different kind of prime minister if elected on December 12.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn will also say he will make sure that more than 100,000 “genuinely affordable” homes are built every year and that rough sleeping comes to an end.</p>
      <p>He will say he would be a “very different kind of prime minister” who “only seeks power in order to share power”.</p>
      <blockquote>I want a Labour government to be judged by whether it changes people’s lives for the better after five years</blockquote>
      <p>The Labour leader will say: “The politics I stand for is about sharing power and wealth with people who don’t have a lot of money and don’t have friends in high places.”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn will add: “The future is ours to make. I want a Labour government to be judged by whether it changes people’s lives for the better after five years.</p>
      <p>“Judge us on the real change we deliver, the concrete improvements to the lives of millions.</p>
      <p>“Judge us on whether in-work poverty still exists in five years’ time.</p>
      <p>“Judge us on whether people are still sleeping rough after five years of a Labour government.</p>
      <p>“Judge us on whether proud women and men are still having to depend on food banks five years into a Labour government.</p>
      <p>“Judge us on whether we’ve got Brexit sorted within six months so we can get on with delivering the real change that Britain needs.</p>
      <p>“Judge us on whether we’ve unleashed a Green Industrial Revolution, created hundreds of thousands of green energy jobs in the communities that need them most and significantly reduced our greenhouse emissions.</p>
      <blockquote>I will be a very different kind of prime minister. Not the kind of prime minister who believes he was born to rule. Not the kind who thinks politics is a game</blockquote>
      <p>“For me, real politics, the politics I stand for, is about sharing power and wealth with people who don’t have a lot of money and don’t have friends in high places – to take control of their own lives.</p>
      <p>“My job as leader, and my party’s job, is to champion those people, and bring about real change.</p>
      <p>“So if you, the British people, elect a Labour government on December 12, I will be proud to be your prime minister. Because I will be a very different kind of prime minister. Not the kind of prime minister who believes he was born to rule. Not the kind who thinks politics is a game.</p>
      <p>“But the kind of prime minister who only seeks power in order to share power – because it isn’t about me, it’s about all of us.”</p>
      <blockquote>Unfortunately for Jeremy Corbyn, he will be judged on his dismal record as Labour leader</blockquote>
      <p>Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: “Unfortunately for Jeremy Corbyn, he will be judged on his dismal record as Labour leader.</p>
      <p>“Given his track record of broken promises, very few people will believe a word he says.</p>
      <p>“He promised to end unlimited immigration from the EU, he promised to leave the single market and he promised to respect the result of the referendum.</p>
      <p>“Now he is saying that he will try to negotiate a deal that does none of those things and he wants to hold two more referendums.”</p>
