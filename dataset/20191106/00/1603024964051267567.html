      <p>Punjab National Bank on November 5 reported a profit at Rs 507.1 crore in Q2FY20, though asset quality weakened sequentially. Other income, PPoP and lower provisions compared to the year-ago period helped the lender report a profit during the quarter.</p>
      <p>The numbers were better than expected. An analysts' poll conducted by CNBC-TV18 had expected the bank to report a loss of Rs 1,521.5 crore. The bank had reported a loss of Rs 4,532.35 crore in the year-ago period due to a spike in provisions.</p>
      <p>Net interest income during the September quarter increased 7.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,263.8 crore, with credit degrowth of 0.7 percent YoY. Deposits in Q2FY20 increased 7 percent YoY.</p>
      <p>At 1017 hrs, Punjab National Bank was quoting at Rs 63.80, down Rs 0.95, or 1.47 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 64.90 and an intraday low of Rs 63.35.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
