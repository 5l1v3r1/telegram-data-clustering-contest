      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - A settlement has been reached over a deadly Honolulu high-rise fire, although the amounts to be paid by insurance companies to plaintiffs remains confidential.</p>
      <p>The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that a settlement conference was concluded Tuesday regarding the July 2017 Marco Polo building fire that killed four people.</p>
      <p>Officials say the fire at the 568-unit building was one of the worst in modern Honolulu history, requiring the efforts of about 130 firefighters.</p>
      <p>A judge has ordered defendants to make financial disbursements out of an escrow account by Jan. 15.</p>
      <p>The settlement appears to resolve several lawsuits filed over the fire that caused an estimated $107 million in damage.</p>
