      <p>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) - Saint Mary’s got a familiar test from Wisconsin’s defense at an unfamiliar venue.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ford scored 26 points, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malik-fitts/">Malik Fitts</a> added 16 and the 20th-ranked Gaels hung on to beat Wisconsin 65-63 in overtime in the season opener for both teams on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>“Wisconsin is hard to get baskets on,” Saint Mary’s coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-bennett/">Randy Bennett</a> said. “We just kept grinding and making them work, covering the on-balls and just tried to wear them out.”</p>
      <p>Saint Mary’s led the entire second half before Wisconsin closed the gap and took a brief lead in overtime. But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malik-fitts/">Fitts</a>‘ basket with 55 seconds to play gave the Gaels the lead for good.</p>
      <p>Freshman Kyle Bowen hit 1 of 2 free throws with 4.4 seconds remaining for the Gaels, and Wisconsin had a chance to win it, but Aleem Ford’s deep 3-pointer at the buzzer was short.</p>

      <p>Aleem Ford made a layup with 52 seconds left that tied the game at 54, and he also had a 3-point attempt to win it in regulation that missed just before the buzzer. He finished with seven points.</p>
      <p>It was the Gaels’ first visit to the Sanford Pentagon, which will also welcome Minnesota and Oklahoma for a game on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Saint Mary’s went on a 21-3 run that erased an eight-point deficit and put the Gaels ahead 30-20 just before the break. Wisconsin went without a field goal for a six-minute stretch.</p>
      <p>Jordan Ford, a first-team All-West Coast Conference player last year, fueled the run, scoring 15 points all in the final seven minutes of the half, including three 3-pointers. He finished the night 11-for-24 from the field, including 4-for-8 from beyond the arc.</p>

        <p>“I was just feeling out the game, feeling out how they were playing us,” Ford said. “It only takes one or two shots to get me going. Once I got one 3 down, I was really aggressive and I think it helped our offense.”</p>
        <p>After Wisconsin cut it to 44-40 with just over 10 minutes to play, the Gaels increased it to 50-41 with a 6-1 run capped by a pair of nifty moves down the lane by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/malik-fitts/">Fitts</a>.</p>
        <p>Wisconsin didn’t fade, however, and Nate Reuvers’ 3-pointer with 4:08 to play cut it to 50-49.</p>
        <p>The Badgers shot 42.3% from the field while the Gaels finished at 39.3%. Saint Mary’s out-rebounded Wisconsin 36-28, including 13 on the offensive end, led by Mattias Tass with rebounds.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Saint Mary’s: The Gaels got a strong test early in the season from a Big Ten opponent that never let them build a big lead. Saint Mary’s was the second-ranked team in the West Coast Conference in the preseason, behind No. 8 Gonzaga.</p>
        <p>Wisconsin: The Badgers were picked to finish sixth out of 14 teams in the Big Ten. Their conference opener is Dec. 7 against Indiana.</p>
        <p>LETDOWN</p>
        <p>D’Metrik Trice, Wisconsin’s top returning scorer, wasn’t a threat most of the night and finished with 10 points on 3-of-7 shooting. He missed his only field goal attempt in the first half. His first basket was a 3-pointer early in the second half. Trice rimmed out a wide-open 3-pointer with Wisconsin trailing 54-52 with 1:37 remaining.</p>
        <p>HE SAID IT</p>
        <p>“This is a game I’ll remember for the rest of my life, just because this place is just so cool.” - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-bennett/">Bennett</a> on playing at the Sanford Pentagon.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Saint Mary’s hosts Winthrop on Monday.</p>
        <p>Wisconsin is home to Eastern Illinois on Friday.</p>
