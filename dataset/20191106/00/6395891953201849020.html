      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Alec Baldwin filed a defamation lawsuit Friday against the man who says Baldwin hit him in the face during an argument over a New York City parking space.</p>
      <p>Baldwin wrote in his lawsuit that contractor Wojciech Cieszkowski's claim that he was violently assaulted by the actor is "objectively false."</p>
      <p>"When two New Yorkers get into an argument over a parking space, typically what happens is they exchange a few sharp words and then move on with their lives," Baldwin wrote in the suit filed in Manhattan state Supreme Court. "But that is not what happened here."</p>
      <p>The lawsuit says Cieszkowski made up a false story about the skirmish in an effort to extort money from Baldwin. "Hospital records and video surveillance footage prove that it was a lie," the complaint says. "But Cieszkowski told it to the police and medical professionals anyway."</p>
      <p>Police arrested Baldwin after the Nov. 2, 2018, scuffle over a parking spot in front of Baldwin's Manhattan apartment building. The actor pleaded guilty to harassment in January and agreed to take an anger-management class.</p>
      <p>Cieszkowski sued Baldwin claiming that Baldwin's assault was "physically painful and psychologically traumatic."</p>
      <p>The Pearl River, New York resident referenced Baldwin's recurring "Saturday Night Live" role as President Donald Trump in his lawsuit filed in March and amended May 17. "When you're a star, they let you do it - hit 'em right in the face," the lawsuit said. "Like the man he plays on television, Alec Baldwin is an entitled celebrity with a long history of verbally and physically mistreating others he sees as beneath him."</p>
      <p>Baldwin wrote in the lawsuit that he "lightly pushed Cieszkowski in the chest with one hand" but did not seriously injure him.</p>
      <p>"In fact, Cieszkowski's supposed 'injuries' were so minor, or nonexistent, that his discharge instructions were to take a single dose of Tylenol," the former "30 Rock" star wrote.</p>
      <p>Douglas Lieb, a lawyer for Cieszkowski, called Baldwin's lawsuit "a desperate tactic designed to silence Mr. Cieszkowski."</p>
      <p>"Mr. Cieszkowski won't be deterred from holding Mr. Baldwin accountable for his bullying," Lieb said Tuesday. "Mr. Cieszkowski looks forward to his day in court before a jury of ordinary people like him."</p>
