      <p>DENVER (AP) - A former Denver high school basketball coach has been sentenced to a second prison term after pleading guilty to sexual abuse of a 14-year-old student.</p>
      <p>The Denver Post reports 56-year-old Craig Debiase was sentenced to 12 years for attempted sexual exploitation of a child.</p>
      <p>A judge handed down the maximum legal sentence Oct. 25 following a plea agreement in which prosecutors dropped 10 additional counts of sexual assault of a child.</p>
      <p>A woman testified the former Bishop Machebeuf High School coach sexually assaulted her for three years beginning in 2002.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the woman was one of at least eight victims abused by Debiase.</p>
