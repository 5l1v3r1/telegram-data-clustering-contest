      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - A new federal report into last year’s fatal crash involving a self-driving car in suburban Phoenix says the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> vehicle couldn’t anticipate the actions of jaywalkers.</p>
      <p>The National Transportation Safety Board report also says the SUV wasn’t designed to slam on the brakes to reduce the severity of an unavoidable accident.</p>
      <p>A 49-year-old woman was killed in the March 2018 crash while pushing a bicycle across a dark Tempe street.</p>
      <p>It was the first fatality in the country involving a self-driving vehicle.</p>
      <p>The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office hasn’t decided whether to file charges against the driver.</p>

      <p>According to the Arizona Republic, the NTSB released more than 400 pages of documents this week ahead of a Nov. 19 meeting during which the board will discuss the probable cause of the crash.</p>
