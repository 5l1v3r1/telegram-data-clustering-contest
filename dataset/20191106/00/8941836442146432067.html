      <p>ATHENS, Ohio (AP) - Sam Sloman matched his career-best 53-yard field goal with 3:48 to play, Ryan McWood and Kameron Butler combined a clutch sack and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> (Ohio) edged rival <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ohio-24/">Ohio 24</a>-21 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The game marked the official 150th anniversary of the first collegiate game and was close all the way. The game was tied at 7 at halftime and the teams combined for 24 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>After Ohio quarterback Nathan Rourke’s second rushing touchdown tied the game with 8:58 to play, the RedHawks (5-4, 4-1 Mid-American Conference) took more than five minutes to grind out 40 yards before Sloman’s kick.</p>
      <p>Rourke got the Bobcats to the 37 but after an incomplete pass he was sacked for an 8-yard loss and after a 5-yard penalty for third-and-23 he threw two more incompletions.</p>
      <p>Jaylon Bester ran for 83 yards and two touchdowns for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>, which is now in control of the MAC East Division.</p>
