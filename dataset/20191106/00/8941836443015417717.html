      <p>SAO PAULO (AP) - A small soccer team from outside Sao Paulo will play in Brazil’s top division next year with a deep-pocketed sponsor behind it.</p>
      <p>Bragantino, which last played in the country’s main soccer competition in 1998, secured its spot in next year’s Brazilian championship by beating Guarani 3-1. But it will head into next season with a new name, Red Bull Bragantino.</p>
      <p>The club received an investment of nearly $15 million from the energy drink maker this season, a figure that will reportedly double for 2020.</p>
      <p>Bragantino, which reached the Brazilian league’s final in 1991 but lost to Sao Paulo, leads its current league by eight points with five matches to play.</p>
