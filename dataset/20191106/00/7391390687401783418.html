      <p>Kaia Gerber and Pete Davidson have been spotted a together a few times. Most recently, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7652753/Kaia-Gerber-Pete-Davidsons-date-hometown-Malibu.html">Gerber and Davidson spent time in her hometown</a>, Malibu, California<i>. </i>On Tuesday, Nov. 5, the <i>Daily Mail </i>published photos from their reported visit, which may have been a date. Davidson is usually spotted in New York City, where he is a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member. (Bustle previously reached out to Davidson's manager and Gerber's reps for comment on the rumors, but has not yet received a response.)</p>
      <p><i>Daily Mail </i>reported that Davidson and Gerber went to dinner at Nobu before he drove her home, to her parents' Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber's mansion. This Malibu dinner wasn't the first time that the <i>SNL </i>cast member and the model have been seen together. According to <i>Us Weekly</i>, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pete-davidson-has-lunch-with-kaia-gerber-after-margaret-qualley-split/">Davidson and Gerber got lunch together</a> in New York at a restaurant called Sadelle's on Oct. 20. An eyewitness told <i>the </i>publication, "Pete appeared happy to be with Kaia, and she seemed like she was into Pete, though there was no PDA."</p>
