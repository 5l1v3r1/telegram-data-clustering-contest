      <p>BOSTON (AP) - Massachusetts health officials say a third state resident has died from a vaping-related lung illness.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Public Health announced Wednesday that a man in his 50s from Worcester County died, after telling officials he vaped both nicotine and the marijuana compound THC.</p>
      <p>Officials say more than 200 suspected cases of vaping-associated lung injury have been reported to the health department since September.</p>
      <p>The agency reported the first two deaths last month - a woman in her 40s from Middlesex County and a woman in her 60s from Hampshire County.</p>
      <p>Federal health officials have tallied nearly 1,900 cases of vaping-related lung illness nationwide, including nearly 40 deaths.</p>
