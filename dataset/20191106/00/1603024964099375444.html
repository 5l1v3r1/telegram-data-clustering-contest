      <p>With the term of the current Maharashtra Assembly ending on November 9 and the government formation stand-off still unresolved, a delegation of the BJP, the single largest party in the House, would meet Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on November 7.</p>
      <p>A delegation of the BJP, to be led by state unit president Chandrakant Patil, will meet Koshyari "with a message approved by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis," senior leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He was speaking to reporters outside Varsha, the official residence of the chief minister.</p>

      <p>"The details of the meeting with the governor will be shared with media later," Mungantiwar said.</p>
      <p>He also informed that the party has decided to initiate procedure to select a new state unit president.</p>
      <p>He said incumbent Chandrakant Patil will remain in the next Cabinet.</p>
      <p>"The procedure to select new state BJP chief will be completed by December 31," Mungantiwar said.</p>
      <p>The BJP has adopted the policy of one person one rank.</p>
      <p>Patil, believed to be a close confidante of party chief Amit Shah, took charge as the state BJP president in July this year.</p>
      <p>He held Revenue ministry in the outgoing government.</p>
      <p>The BJP and the Sena are locked in a stand-off over the post of chief minister in new government and sharing of ministerial portfolios.</p>
      <p>In the recent assembly polls, the BJP won the maximum 105 seats in the 288-member House. The Sena won 56 seats.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
