      <h1>Robert Joseph, former envoy, warns over Iran nuclear centrifuge moves</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/lauren-meier/" target="_blank">Lauren Meier</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/department-of-state/">State Department</a> officials are warning of rising risks attached to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s announcement that it will begin injecting uranium gas into over 1,000 centrifuges at one of its main underground facilities beginning at Thursday at midnight.</p>
      <p>The latest move, announced Wednesday, will allow <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> to enrich uranium “far beyond any limitation that it agreed to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> nuclear agreement,” Marc Ginsberg, a former U.S. ambassador to Morocco, told a Capitol Hill briefing organized by a leading umbrella group of anti-regime organizations.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event hosted by the Organization of Iranian-American Communities on Capitol Hill, he said “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> is determined to get nuclear weapons, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> is determined to inflict pain and suffering on America and its allies in the Middle East.”</p>
      <p>The discussion largely focused on the increase in domestic suppression and regional aggression by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tehran/">Tehran</a>, and highlighted speakers including Sens. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, and John Boozman, Arkansas Republican.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Robert Joseph, the former envoy for nuclear nonproliferation under the Bush administration, said “the urgency to act should be evident to all. This is a call to action.”</p>

      <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> is moving step by step to openly reconstitute its nuclear weapons capabilities,” Mr. Joseph said.</p>
      <p>He explained the latest development constitutes a “strong bipartisan resolve to meet the threat.”</p>
      <p>“Only a free and democratic <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> will end the threat, the terrorist threat, the national threat, and the nuclear threat that we face today,” Mr. Joseph added.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>, Behrouz Kamalvandi, told state television that the uranium enrichment will rise up to 4.5%, but is “reversible” if European nations allow Iranian oil to be sold in its markets.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The 4.5% level, while significantly below weapons-grade levels, is enough to help power <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s only nuclear power plant, the Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>U.S. sanctions have been enforced on Iranian oil as well as its economic industry in the wake of the President Trump’s withdrawal in 2018 from the Obama-era nuclear accord, and after several military altercations over the summer between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> and the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>The latest move also increases pressure on European countries to remain in an agreement that has been subject to scrutiny as several nations have accused <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> of violating their accord. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has threatened to withdraw from the deal at the start of 2020 if promised relief from economic sanctions is not delivered.</p>
        <p>If <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> were to pull out of the deal with European nations, various surveillance methods and accountability procedures would be at risk of ending.</p>
        <p>“We cannot tolerate unilateral fulfillment of our commitments and no commitment from their side,” Mr. Rouhani said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Several international organizations have condemned <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tehran/">Tehran</a>’s recent steps to breach the 2015 deal, and European Union spokesperson Maja Kocijancic said the group is “concerned” by the announcement.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/department-of-state/">State Department</a> spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement that “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> has no credible reason to expand its uranium enrichment program, at the Fordo facility or elsewhere, other than a clear attempt at nuclear extortion that will only deepen its political and economic isolation.”</p>
