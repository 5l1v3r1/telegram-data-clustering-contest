      <p>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/debra-stephens/">Justice Debra Stephens</a> has been elected by her fellow members of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-supreme-court/">Washington Supreme Court</a> to be chief justice next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/debra-stephens/">Stephens</a>, 54, will replace current Chief <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-fairhurst/">Justice Mary Fairhurst</a>, who announced last month she will retire from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-supreme-court/">high court</a> in January to focus on her health as she fights a third bout of cancer.</p>
      <p>The chief justice presides over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-supreme-court/">court</a>’s public hearings, serves as the administrative head of the state’s judicial branch, and is the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-supreme-court/">court</a>’s main spokesperson.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/debra-stephens/">Stephens</a> will serve the final year of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-fairhurst/">Fairhurst</a>’s term as chief justice. The next full, four-year term election for chief justice will occur in November 2020.</p>
      <p>In an emailed statement, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/debra-stephens/">Stephens</a> wrote that she was honored by the selection and wrote: “We will all miss Mary greatly.”</p>

      <p>“She has been an amazing and inspirational leader for so many years, and I hope to continue in her tradition,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/debra-stephens/">Stephens</a> wrote.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-fairhurst/">Fairhurst</a>, 62, was first elected to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-supreme-court/">court</a> in 2002 and was elected chief justice by her colleagues in 2016.</p>
      <p>She was first diagnosed with colon cancer in late 2008, and it later spread to a lung. After a final treatment in 2011 and several years of no evidence of disease, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-fairhurst/">Fairhurst</a> said that the cancer returned late last year - appearing in her lungs, liver, thyroid and spleen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-fairhurst/">Fairhurst</a> continued to work while undergoing chemotherapy. She said her decision to retire became clear after she asked her doctor for her life-expectancy prognosis and learned she had between nine months and two years.</p>

        <p>“I’m an overachiever, and I believe in miracles so I’m not accepting that as a death sentence. But I am accepting it as the universe telling me I need to focus on my health and spend time with my family and friends and let the good work we’ve been doing here on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-supreme-court/">court</a> continue with those who have more energy than I have going forward,” she said in an interview last month.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/debra-stephens/">Stephens</a>, who previously served as a judge for Division Three of the Court of Appeals, was first appointed to the state <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a> in January 2008. She was elected to a six-year term in November 2008, then re-elected in 2014.</p>
        <p>Early next month, Gov. Jay Inslee is expected to appoint a new justice to fulfill the remaining year of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mary-fairhurst/">Fairhurst</a>’s term, and the seat will be open for election in 2020.</p>
        <p>Both the new justice and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/debra-stephens/">Stephens</a> as the new chief justice will be sworn in Jan. 6.</p>
        <p>The other members of the court are: Justices Barbara Madsen, Charles Johnson, Susan Owens, Steven Gonzalez, Sheryl Gordon McCloud, Charles Wiggins and Mary Yu.</p>
