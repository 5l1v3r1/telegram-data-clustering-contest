      <h1>Trial to begin for Omoyele Sowore, a New Jersey journalist imprisoned in his native Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:24:29+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 00:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/" target="_blank">Ricardo Kaulessar, North Jersey Record</a></address>
      <p>Omoyele Sowore's family and friends are hoping the Haworth resident will come back to New Jersey soon.</p>
      <p>The journalist is standing trial beginning Wednesday in his home country of Nigeria on <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/2019/09/22/owoyele-sowore-bergen-county-journalist-arrested-nigeria/2411816001/">charges that followed his Aug. 3 arrest</a> while he was organizing a peaceful pro-democracy protest.</p>
      <p>He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include organizing a protest, insulting Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and transferring U.S. money to a Nigerian account. </p>
      <p>Sowore is the founder of Sahara Reporters, a pro-democracy, anti-corruption online news service that has been critical of the Nigerian government.</p>
      <p>Since his August arrest, he has been held in a prison in Nigeria's largest city, Lagos.</p>
      <p>The requirements of his bail, set at $829,000, prevent Sowore from talking to the press. </p>
      <p>During his time in prison, his wife, Opeyemi, and their two children have received support from their Haworth neighbors, <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/haworth/2019/10/28/omoyele-sowore-nigerian-journalist-imprisoned-receives-rally-support-from-haworth-nj/2483034001/">who helped organize an event on Oct. 28</a> near Borough Hall calling for his safe release and return to the U.S.</p>

      <p>Sowore told NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey that she was "truly humbled by the outpouring of support and prayers from my community. The <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/haworth/2019/10/28/omoyele-sowore-nigerian-journalist-imprisoned-receives-rally-support-from-haworth-nj/2483034001/">Tie a Yele Ribbon gathering</a> last week brought such comfort and strength to our family."</p>
      <p>She said their father's imprisonment and trial has been "very hard" on their children. </p>
      <p>"They miss their father dearly. We continue to pray for his safe return home to us in New Jersey," Sowore said.</p>

      <p>Sowore said her husband is being represented in court by Femi Falana, a human rights attorney and activist, and the legal team for him will update her about the trial. A judge in Nigeria's Federal High Court called for an expedited trial that could end as soon as Friday. </p>
      <p>Omoyele Sowore's family and supporters have also called upon their congressional representatives to help get the 48-year-old journalist back to New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who represents Sowore's district in Congress, said, "We've continued to be in close touch with the State Department and with Mr. Sowore's family as this has developed."  </p>
      <p>Expressing support for Sowore have been organizations including Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights and the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa. </p>
      <p>California Rep. Karen Bass said in a statement, "I stand with the human rights and international community in declaring that the continued detainment of Mr. Omoyele Sowore is a flagrant violation of his human rights."</p>
