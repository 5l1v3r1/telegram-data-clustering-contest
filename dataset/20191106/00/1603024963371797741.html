      <p>Lashing out at the authorities for failing to curb severe air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region, the Supreme Court Wednesday said it is a question of life and death of crores of people here but it is "very unfortunate" that they are not bothered about poor people and letting them die.</p>
      <p>"Can you permit people to die like this due to pollution? Can you permit the country to go back by 100 years," observed a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.</p>
      <p>"We have to make government responsible for this," the bench said and asked, "Why can't government machinery stop stubble burning?"</p>

      <p>Coming down heavily on state governments, the top court said that if they don't bother about people, they have no right to be in power.</p>
      <p>"You (states) have forgotten the concept of welfare government. They are not bothered about poor people, this is very unfortunate," said the bench, also comprising Justice Deepak Gupta.</p>
      <p>"You just want to sit in your ivory towers and rule. You are not bothered and are letting the people die," the bench said.</p>
      <p>It also questioned as to why the state governments cannot collect and purchase stubble from farmers.</p>
      <p>"We expect more from democratic government of the country to deal with issue of stubble burning and curb pollution," the bench said, adding that "it is a question of life and death of crores of people. We have to make govt responsible for this".</p>
      <p>Terming the situation as shocking, the apex court on Monday had summoned Chief Secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
