        <b>Sharekhan's research report on<a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/electricals/bharatelectronics/BE03"> Bharat Electronics</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>We expect revenue and earnings to clock CAGR of 14.4% and 7.7% (owing to high base effect led by execution of EVM order in FY2019) during FY2019-2021E. Order book remains robust at Rs. 56,178 crore, at 4.6x of FY2019 revenue provides strong earnings visibility, however timely execution remains a key. BEL reported a poor show in Q2FY2020 as revenue; EBITDA and PAT were lower by 19%, 36% and 41% y-o-y respectively owing to absence of significant EVM order which was in base quarter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>We reiterate our Buy rating on Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) with unchanged price target of Rs. 140.</p>
