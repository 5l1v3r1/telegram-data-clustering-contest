      <p>Share price of <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/construction-contracting-real-estate/godrejproperties/GP11">Godrej Properties</a> jumped over 2 percent in early trade on November 6 after the company reported a 50 percent YoY rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 31 crore for the quarter ended September 2019.</p>
      <p>Total income for the quarter declined 22 percent from the year-ago to Rs 370 crore.</p>
      <p>“The overall environment in the real estate sector remains challenging. This provides Godrej Properties with tremendous opportunity to drive market share growth in residential real estate.
