        <b>UEFA Champions League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Liverpool 2-1 Genk</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 05 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Anfield Stadium</p>
      <p>Liverpool moved to the top of Group E following a 2-1 victory over Genk in the UEFA Champions League at the Anfield Stadium on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The defending champions give a run to Naby Keita, James Milner as well as last season’s semi-final and final hero Divock Origi.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk came close to breaking the deadlock inside the first nine minutes when he headed a corner from Trent Alexander-Arnold, which went off target.</p>
      <p>Liverpool didn’t wait long to get the noses in front after Georginio Wijnaldum flicked home a loose ball in the area following poor defending from Genk who failed to clear Origi’s cross.</p>
      <p>Chances followed for the Reds when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slipped a ball to Keita, who failed to beat Gaetan Coucke with successive attempts from close range after 24 minutes.</p>
      <p>Genk levelled the playing field five minutes to halftime when Mbwanna Samatta rose to nod home a dangerous delivery to the area from Bryan Heynen.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp and his opposite number Felice Mazzu came out for the second half unchanged from the first spell.</p>
      <p>Liverpool regained the front foot through Oxlade-Chamberlain who finished off a layoff from Mohamed Salah on 53 minutes on the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>Salah scuffed a big opportunity for a third six minutes later from the cusp of the penalty area after getting the better of Sebastien Dewaest, but the Egyptian dragged the attempt wide.</p>
      <p>Klopp switched his structure in the last 15 minutes, as Sadio Mane pulled off the training coat to replace Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
      <p>Genk pushed for the equaliser in the final few minutes of the match, but the sixth time European champions ran out victors in the end.</p>
