      <p>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Alabama’s Student Government Association is warning students they could lose their block seating for the rest of the season if they “engage in disruptive behavior” during the LSU game.</p>
      <p>Jason Rothfarb, the SGA’s vice president of student affairs, sent out a letter citing the increased security at Saturday’s game between the second-ranked Crimson Tide and No. 1 LSU. President Donald Trump is expected to attend the game, and Alabama is warning fans to arrive early and expect longer waits getting into Bryant-Denny Stadium.</p>
      <p>A later statement from the SGA said the letter was “meant only to remind students about heightened security and the consequences of altercations or other behaviors unbecoming of a University of Alabama student, as defined in the Capstone Creed.”</p>

        <p>It said there was no “political context” intended and that “the SGA strongly affirms its belief in free speech and the rights of all students to express their opinions.”</p>
