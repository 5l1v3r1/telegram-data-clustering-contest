      <p><b>Topline</b>: A former quality control engineer at Boeing has claims that up to 25% of oxygen systems on the 787 Dreamliner aircraft could be faulty, according to the BBC.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whistleblower John Barnett <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50293927">told</a> the BBC that safety was compromised in a bid to get planes off the production line more quickly, meaning faulty parts were deliberately fitted onto the 787 Dreamliner at one Boeing factory in North Charleston, South Carolina.</li>
        <li>Barnett, who worked at Boeing for 32 years until his retirement in March 2017, said he identified problems with cosmetically damaged emergency oxygen systems in 2016. The findings prompted him to arrange tests on 300 undamaged systems, where he found that a quarter of them were not deploying when they were supposed to.</li>
        <li>The 57-year-old also claimed that the company lost track of several parts in the assembly process, while workers under pressure fitted parts of the airplane from scrap bins. He blamed the issues on what he says was a culture of meeting targets and cost-cutting, allegations that have been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/07/29/ex-boeing-engineer-says-workers-were-pressured-to-keep-costs-down-amid-737-max-grounding/#4972ab1c2e9a">leveled</a> against Boeing by other whistleblowers.</li>
        <li>But Boeing has rejected Barnett’s claims and told the broadcaster that it implements a “rigorous inspection process,” adding that passenger oxygen systems undergo multiple tests.</li>
        <li>However, the plane maker did admit that it in 2017 it had “identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly,” but that they were not placed onto aircraft and that they addressed their supplier about it, the BBC reported.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: The world’s biggest plane maker has come under intense scrutiny following two fatal crashes in five months involving its 737MAX model, which has been grounded since March. The aviation giant, already on its back foot, faces additional pressure with new claims about safety issues with the flagship 787 Dreamliner and negative publicity around structural issues with older models of the 737NG aircraft.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent: </b><i>The Guardian</i> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/06/boeing-737-cracks-ryanair-grounds-three-planes-due-to-cracking-between-wing-and-fuselage">reports</a> that Ryanair has grounded three 737NG planes after cracks were discovered on the pickle fork—the part of the aircraft that strengthens the connection of the wing to the body of the plane. Ryanair follows Southwest Airlines, Qantas, Gol Linhas Aereas and Indonesia's Sriwijaya Air in grounding 737NG aircraft that were discovered to have the same structural flaw.</p>
