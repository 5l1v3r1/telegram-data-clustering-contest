      <p>It’s a Van Gogh! It’s a Matisse! It’s a… Samsung? As a member of the Samsung Frame Series, this TV turns into a stunning piece of art when not in use. The device will automatically cycle through its digital artwork via its art mode feature, which adapts the image on the screen to display optimally based on room light conditions. While a little gimmicky in its description, in person, it’s hard not to notice this Samsung, even when it’s not in use — and that’s part of the point. With multiple supported HDR formats, Dolby Digital Plus sound and excellent motion clarity, this TV is a showstopper (both when it’s on and idling in the background).</p>

      <h3>Samsung 55-inch Q60R Series Smart TV</h3>

      <p>The Samsung Q60R series is a great way to get access to Samsung’s QLED technology without having to shell out the big bucks on much more expensive offerings. This TV comes with a 4K resolution, support for HDR and offers Samsung’s Quantum Processor 4K. </p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, Samsung’s QLED tech is built to deliver bright, vivid colors and a natural image. While entry-level models in Samsung’s QLED range, like this one, can’t handle black levels as well as the company’s more expensive QLED offerings, their blacks are still deep and relatively natural — which seriously helps deliver quality content. Last but not least, the 55-inch size of the TV is perfect for immersive watching in small-to-medium living rooms. All that to say, if you’re looking for an ultra-high-end TV at a relatively affordable price, this is the one to get.</p>

      <p>Looking to step things up a little when it comes to TV size? The Q60R is also available in a 65-inch model, which is perfect for larger living rooms and ultra-immersive content. The TV still leverages Samsung’s awesome QLED tech, and like the smaller TV, it still offers the ultra-smart Tizen operating system that allows you to connect the TV to your smart home, watch all your favorite content, and so on.</p>
      <p>At $999.99, the 65-inch Samsung Q60R TV is an absolute steal — and well worth considering if you'd like a large TV for a bit less.</p>

      <p>The Samsung Q60R series is great, but if you want to take things to the next level, it’s worth considering the Samsung Q70 Series. The Q70 takes the awesome QLED tech and adds a new technology called local dimming, which makes for much deeper black levels and a higher level of contrast. The end result is that the image will look a lot more natural, especially during night scenes and other dark images. More dimming zones is better, and this TV offers 48.</p>
      <p>The TV still offers the awesome smart tech on offer by the other TVs on this list, and at $1,200, it is a great option for a high-end TV. </p>

      <p>65 inches is pretty big, but if you really want to impress, perhaps it’s worth considering a 75-inch TV instead.

      <p>The discounts are bigger here too — while the 75-inch Samsung Q70 is normally available for $2,700, the TV has been discounted by a whopping $700 to $2000.</p>
