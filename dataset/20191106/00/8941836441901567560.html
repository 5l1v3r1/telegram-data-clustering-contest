      <p>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Latest on New Jersey’s election (all times local):</p>
      <p>9:55 p.m.</p>
      <p>New Jersey voters agreed to a ballot question to let veterans living in retirement communities get a $250 property tax deduction.</p>
      <p>The question was the only statewide referendum on Tuesday’s ballot.</p>
      <p>Legislative estimates show the deduction would carry a cost to taxpayers of $350,000 to $550,000 annually. That’s just a small fraction of the state’s roughly $39 billion budget.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>It’s unclear, though, exactly how many beneficiaries the expanded deduction would affect.</p>
      <p>Also on the ballot are all 80 of the Democrat-led General Assembly seats, and one state Senate election, where voters are picking Democrat Rep. Jeff Van Drew’s successor.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>8 p.m.</p>

        <p>Polls in New Jersey’s election to select all 80 General Assembly members have closed.</p>
        <p>All the seats in the Democrat-controlled Assembly were atop the ballot for New Jersey voters in Tuesday’s election.</p>
        <p>There were also local races and a statewide ballot question to decide if veterans residing in retirement communities should get a $250 property tax deduction.</p>
        <p>There was also a single state Senate seat on the ticket in southern New Jersey’s 1st District to fill the seat vacated when Democrat Jeff Van Drew went to Congress.</p>
        <p>County offices have been accepting mail-in ballots for weeks, though.</p>
        <p>State data show roughly 600,000 mail-in ballots have been sent. The last time the Assembly topped the ballot in 2015, about 114,000 or nearly 10% of ballots cast were through the mail.</p>
        <p>5:25 a.m.</p>
        <p>Polls open at 6 a.m. in New Jersey’s elections.</p>
        <p>At the top of the ballot Tuesday are all 80 of the seats in the Democrat-led General Assembly.</p>
        <p>A number of local races and a statewide ballot question on whether veterans living in retirement communities should get a $250 property tax deduction are also on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Voters in the 1st District are also electing a successor to fill Rep. Jeff Van Drew’s state Senate seat since he was elected to Congress.</p>
        <p>Polls are open until 8 p.m. County offices have been accepting mail-in ballots for weeks, though.</p>
