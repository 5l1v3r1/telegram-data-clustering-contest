      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/chile.html">Chile</a>'s President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/sebastian-pinera.html">Sebastian Pinera</a> said on Tuesday that he will not resign in the face of deadly <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/sebastian-pinera.html">protests over inequality</a> and poor social conditions that have entered their third week.</p>
      <p>Asked by the BBC in an interview whether he will step down, the billionaire conservative leader said: "No."</p>
      <p>"These problems have been accumulating for the past 30 years," Pinera said. "I am responsible (for) part of it and I assume my responsibility, but I'm not the only one."</p>
      <p>The violence gripping one of Latin America's most prosperous countries forced the government to cancel separate international economic and climate summits and open talks with the left-wing opposition.</p>

      <p>Chile's football federation on Tuesday called off an international friendly match with Bolivia slated for the National Stadium in Santiago on November 15.</p>
      <p>The decision threw into doubt Santiago's ability to host the South America Copa Libertadores club championship final on November 23.</p>
      <p>South American football authorities were meeting in Asuncion to consider whether to maintain the troubled Chilean capital as the venue for the showpiece final.</p>
      <h3>Economic slowdown expected</h3>
      <p>In his interview, Pinera defended his decision to declare a state of emergency but promised to look into allegations of police violence and abuse.</p>
      <p>The interview came as the president announced a package of measures for small and medium-sized businesses hit by the unrest.</p>
      <p>Some 6,800 companies affected by rioting, looting and fires will benefit from financial aid and tax deductions.</p>
      <p>Protesters clashed with police and looted stores at the close of a huge rally on Monday that marked the start of the third week of protests in Santiago.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered in the Plaza de Italia, the epicentre of the unrest over economic inequality and a raft of other social woes and tried to march on the presidential palace in downtown Santiago.</p>
      <p>Fights broke out with police trying to contain them, with officers firing water cannon and tear gas. One officer was hit in the face with a Molotov cocktail.</p>
      <p>Looting and vandalism were reported in the cities of Vina del Mar, Valparaiso and Concepcion.</p>
      <p>Protesters organised rallies on Monday under the slogan "This is not over."</p>
      <p>Some citizens returned to work despite the vandalism that has damaged the underground train network.</p>
      <p>"There are many alleged complaints about excessive use of force and if that took place I can guarantee you that it will be investigated," Pinera said.</p>
      <p>"There will be no impunity," he said, defending the stepped-up security measures as "democratic and constitutional."</p>
      <p>Pinera held inconclusive talks with opposition parties last week but made no reference to them in segments of the interview aired by the BBC.</p>
      <p>Protesters are calling for constitutional reform. Chile's current constitution dates back to the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.</p>
      <p>A survey by pollster Cadem published on Sunday indicated that 87 percent of Chileans favoured such reforms.</p>
      <p>The study indicated Pinera's approval rating had plunged to 13 percent.</p>
      <p>The government said Chile's economy grew three percent in September but it forecast a contraction of 0.5 percent in October due to the unrest.</p>
