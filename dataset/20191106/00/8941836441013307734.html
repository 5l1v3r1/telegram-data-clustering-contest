      <p>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - A prominent Hungarian mayor caught on video taking part in an orgy says he is resigning despite being re-elected last month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zsolt-borkai/">Zsolt Borkai</a>, a former Olympic champion gymnast and mayor of the western city of Gyor since 2006, said Wednesday that he is resigning effective Friday, to avoid hindering the city’s development.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zsolt-borkai/">Borkai</a> wrote in a letter to Gyor’s residents that “I draw the conclusions and accept responsibility.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zsolt-borkai/">Borkai</a> ran as a candidate of Prime Minister Orban’s Fidesz party and his scandal was considered one of the causes of Fidesz’s surprisingly weak results in the Oct. 13 municipal elections. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/zsolt-borkai/">Borkai</a> resigned from Fidesz on Oct. 15 but said then that he would continue to serve as mayor.</p>
