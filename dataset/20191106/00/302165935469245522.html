      <p>VALENCIA, Nov 6 — Valencia’s hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in six years received a boost with a 4-1 win over Lille in Group H yesterday.</p>
      <p>Nigeria forward Victor Osimhen gave the visitors a first-half lead before Dani Parejo, Geoffrey Kondogbia, Ferran Torres and an Adama Soumaoro own goal claimed all three points for the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>Valencia’s victory moves them level on seven points with Chelsea and Ajax, who drew 4-4 in the other game in the group.</p>
      <p>“The team has always believed, at 1-0 we also believed, we went to sleep for the first goal, but the team managed to react, the players were incredible, it is a performance we all needed,” Valencia coach Albert Celades told broadcasters Movistar.</p>
      <p>Lille can no longer reach the knockout stages due to their head-to-head record against the three other clubs.</p>
      <p>The French club’s boss Christophe Galtier said his side remained in the tie up until Soumaoro put the ball in his own net.</p>
      <p>“Until the 81st minute we tried to stay in the game, we made changes which were meant to have an impact. From the 81st to the 90th it was a nightmare,” Galtier said.</p>
      <p>Galtier made three changes from the weekend’s loss at Marseille including bringing in Osimhen for Jonathan Ikone, who was ruled out after a car accident.</p>
      <p>Celades brought in centre-back Gabriel for Mouctar Diakhaby as the French youth international served a suspension for a red card received in the reverse fixture in October.</p>
      <p>The visitors dominated the early moments thanks to their high press and took a deserved lead after 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>Valencia captain Parejo’s attempted pass inside Lille’s half was deflected into Osimhen’s path.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old sped past centre-backs Gabriel and Ezequiel Garay before nutmegging Jasper Cillessen for his second goal in four European games this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Second-half comeback</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spaniards, who sit in 13th in La Liga, were level 20 minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Parejo made up for his first-half error by delicately chipping a penalty kick after referee Sergei Karasev punished Jose Fonte for handball.</p>
      <p>Celades’ side pressed on looking for the winner and Osimhen threatened the hosts’ back four with his searing speed on the counter-attack.</p>
      <p>Valencia’s efforts were rewarded after 82 minutes.</p>
      <p>Left-back Jose Gaya played in a cross and Soumaoro’s attempted clearance trickled over the line at the back post.</p>
      <p>They extended their lead two minutes later with a superb long-range strike from French-born Kondogbia and Torres hit home in the 90th minute to seal the three points.</p>
      <p>Valencia host Chelsea in the next round on November 27 and Lille play Ajax in northern France. — AFP</p>
