      <p>Last week, the U.S. Navy celebrated the USS <i>Gerald R. Ford</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier">CVN 78</a>), sending the troubled aircraft carrier to sea for the first time in 15 months. But the Navy also released a set of <a href="https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=111313">troubling statistics</a> that show the Navy’s own business case for the <i>Ford</i> class aircraft carrier is crumbling, with the <i>Ford</i> offering far less of an efficiency boost over the Navy’s legacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier"><i>Nimitz</i></a> class carriers than expected. The decline in performance was stark. Days before <a href="https://news.usni.org/2019/10/25/worlds-most-expensive-warship-starts-sea-trials-after-more-than-a-year-of-repairs">the USS <i>Ford </i>went to sea</a>, Secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer, restated his business case for abandoning older but proven <i>Nimitz</i>-class carriers on October 23, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-navy-in-an-era-of-great-power-competition/">boasting</a>, “I get 30 percent more sortie generation, 25 percent fewer people on board, and a maintenance cycle that’ll be improved compared to the <i>Nimitz</i>, it is an efficiency game-changer. So let me abandon an older vessel and move to the newer fleet.”</p>
      <p>Spencer sounded confident. But in the space of just eight days, after USS <i>Ford </i>returned from sea trials, marking the triumphant end of a grueling 15-month post-shakedown availability/Selective Restricted Availability, the Navy crushed Secretary Spencer’s business case, reporting a five percent increase in crew and operation and maintenance numbers that were higher than expected.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=111313">Navy press release</a> noted that the work done by the USS <i>Ford</i> would now be “executed with a 20 percent reduction in crew, at a significant cost savings, when compared to <i>Nimitz</i>-class ships. The <i>Gerald R. Ford</i>-class carrier offers a 17 percent reduction — approximately $4 billion per ship — in life cycle operations and support costs compared to the earlier <i>Nimitz</i> class.”</p>
      <p>The three primary performance estimates used to sell the <i>Ford</i>–high sortie generation rates, big crew reductions and lower operating costs–will continue to decay. And as the <i>Ford’s</i> original rose-tinted performance estimates collapse under real-world testing, the $13 billion USS <i>Ford</i> will start to look more and more like a $5 billion <i>Nimitz</i>.</p>

        <b>Spencer’s Failing Business Case</b>
      </p>
      <p>Secretary Spencer regularly uses sortie generation rate, crew reductions and lower operating costs to sell The <i>Ford</i> Class. He extolls the <i>Ford’s</i> “business case” before Congress, marrying unproven statistics with a home-spun appeal to what he claims are standard U.S. private-sector business practices. </p>
      <p>But Spencer’s estimates of American business practices are just as pliable as the <i>Ford’s</i> performance estimates. In an April 2019 <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/2019/4/the-fy20-national-defense-authorization-budget-request-for-the-department-of-navy">hearing</a> before the House Armed Services Committee, Spencer proselytized, “When, in fact, a new platform is presented to anyone who is modernizing in the 20 percent improvement range, people abandon assets to make the case to move towards more effective, more efficient, and, in our case, more lethal platforms.”</p>
      <p>But in the space of six months, American businesses—at least according to Spencer—had changed the goal posts by five percent. At his October appearance at the Brookings Institution, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-navy-in-an-era-of-great-power-competition/">Spencer chortled</a>, “Abandoning an asset is a tough thing to do, but if you look at fleets, whether aviation, trucking, taxi, whatever the case may be, industry moves on about a 15 percent efficiency. So, if you can develop an airplane that’s more than 15 percent more fuel efficient, or carry more people, the industry will move to that platform.”</p>
      <p>If the Navy Secretary’s defense of the USS <i>Ford’s</i> business case continues down this myopic course, taxpayers will soon realize that they have paid three times as much for a new aircraft carrier that may only offer a few percentage points of efficiency over the legacy <i>Nimitz </i>class in sortie generation, crew size and annual operational costs.</p>
      <p>And unless the Secretary of the Navy intends to look even sillier than he does today, the <i>Ford</i> selling points need to change.  </p>

        <b>This Is Just Going To Get Worse:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Navy Secretary’s slavish devotion to the <i>Ford’s</i> failing business case is perplexing. Informed observers have warned for years that the three foundational metrics used to “sell” the <i>Ford</i> Class—crew size, life cycle costs and sortie generation rate—were at risk.</p>
      <p>Topping things off, the Navy has an ugly habit of overselling crew-reduction, with rosy initial predictions rarely holding up under real-world conditions. The <i>Ford </i>is no different. The “minimally-manned” <i>Ford</i> already has more sailors aboard than were originally expected. The <a href="https://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2018/pdf/navy/2018cvn78.pdf">original berthing capacity</a> for the <i>Ford</i> was for 4,660 sailors, but 2017-18 estimates ranged from 4,656 to 4,758. That estimate seems to have grown even more in the interim. While concrete numbers are hard to come by, what we do know is that the crew growth forced the ship to add berthing spaces, and, given that the final staffing requirements for the new catapults, arresting gear, radar, elevators and aircraft are still poorly understood, even more sailors will likely be needed. Over time, the <i>Ford’s</i> crew seems set to grow to within ten to fifteen percent of the legacy <i>Nimitz</i> Class.</p>
      <p>For a naval vessel, recovery from an over-optimistic reduction in crew size is a tough process. Expanding a “minimally manned” crew has cascading effects. Hotel service margins shrink, endurance predictions plummet and innumerable secondary impacts cascade throughout the ship and fleet. It may be easy to add in another bunk into berthing spaces, but adding a few hundred additional crew demands more freezer space, more refrigerator capacity, replenishment support and so forth. It is not an easy fix.</p>
      <p>Navy ship life cycle and operations support costs are another area where the Navy’s initial rosy estimates rarely pan out. According to Eric Wertheim’s exhaustive ship compendium, the 2013 issue of the <a href="https://www.usni.org/press/books/naval-institute-guide-combat-fleets-world-16th-edition"><i>Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World</i></a>, <i>Ford</i> advocates had hoped for a 30 percent reduction in maintenance costs and a far longer 43 month maintenance cycle (A <i>Nimitz </i>maintenance cycle is 32 months). With current estimates now suggesting only a 17 percent reduction in operations and maintenance costs, the trend lines are not healthy. The <i>Ford’s </i>operational costs seem likely to continue spiraling, failing to recoup the hefty procurement cost differential between the legacy <i>Nimitz</i> class and the new <i>Fords</i>.</p>
      <p>Operations and maintenance costs also fail to capture the extra infrastructure modifications of the <i>Ford</i>. One example of unaccounted cost are the expensive shipyard modifications required before the new <i>Fords </i>can be serviced in America’s naval shipyards—somehow the <i>Ford</i> is just big enough to force the wholesale rebuilding of the Navy’s handful of carrier-ready dry docks.</p>
      <p>The final statistic is sortie rate. The only reason why the USS <i>Ford’s</i> sortie generation rates have remained steady at thirty percent over the past few months is because the sortie generation rates have not been formally tested. But performance to date is distressing. In fact, the <i>Ford</i> has only generated <a href="https://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2018/pdf/navy/2018cvn78.pdf">747 sorties</a> in the two years it has been commissioned, so, at this point, extolling the <i>Ford</i> as a better sortie generator than a <i>Nimitz</i> class aircraft carrier is, at this point, factually wrong.</p>
      <p>The <i>Nimitz </i>Class has demonstrated a sustained <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/667092.pdf">sortie generation rate</a> of 120 launches and recoveries over a twelve-hour flight day, sustaining that level of operation for thirty days. The Navy hopes the <i>Ford</i> will demonstrate 160 sorties a day over the same time period. The goal for the <i>Ford’s </i>surge sortie rate, which testers hope will be achieved and sustained over four days of continuous, 24-hour a day flying, is 270 sorties, versus a proven 240 sorties for the <i>Nimitz</i> Class.</p>
      <p>Reaching those operational goals will be hard. It is unlikely the <i>Ford’s </i>targeted performance level will be met without additional personnel and contractor support. The electromagnetic launch and recovery systems aboard the <i>Ford</i> are still experimental and may struggle under a high operational tempo in sub-optimal conditions. The <i>Ford’s</i> sortie generation rate target may be achievable once, under ideal test conditions, but, unless something dramatically changes in the operational makeup of the carrier wing’s composition, the USS <i>Ford</i> will be hard-pressed to meet <i>Nimitz</i> class performance levels when deployed.</p>
      <p>Secretary Spencer knows his metrics are at risk. The <a href="https://www.dote.osd.mil/">Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation</a>, the Pentagon’s weapons testing agency, cautioned in its <a href="https://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2018/pdf/navy/2018cvn78.pdf">fiscal year 2018 testing report</a>, “Unrealistic assumptions underpin the SGR (sortie generation rate) threshold requirement. These assumptions ignore the effects of weather, aircraft emergencies, ship maneuvers, and current air wing composition on flight operations.” In plain English, the <i>Ford</i> will struggle to meet its sortie generation performance targets.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Why Keep Doing It?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the three major metrics that underpin the business case for the <i>Ford</i> are failing, why do top Navy leaders continue to use them? There are certainly many other potential benefits to the <i>Ford</i>; ideally, the ship positions the United States to operate unmanned aircraft at sea, allowing a far wider range of aircraft to operate from the vessel than a legacy carrier equipped with a steam catapult might. The Navy is solving immense technical challenges inherent in electromagnetic systems. Surely some of the twenty-three new technologies added to the ship are working well and can be discussed in a public forum.</p>
      <p>Put bluntly, the<i> Ford</i> is an audacious technological gamble whose challenges should have been far more openly embraced to inspire both the American people as well as future naval recruits.</p>
      <p>Continuing on the current course is a recipe for disaster. Insisting upon comparing the <i>Ford</i> class aircraft carrier to the legacy <i>Nimitz</i> class makes no sense. The <i>Ford’s</i> statistical top-line is not going to improve for some time. No semantic gamesmanship can overcome the obvious fact that the<i> Ford’s</i> original business case is failing and must be reoriented.</p>
      <p>And finally, it does not build confidence when, in the space of eight days, the Navy’s senior leadership are unable to keep their stories straight on the <i>Ford’s</i> three fundamental performance goals—goals that have been presented in testimony before Congress. It only makes observers wonder if this erratic messaging reflects poor knowledge of the facts or just poor judgment.</p>
