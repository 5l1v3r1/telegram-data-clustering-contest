      <p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/pharmaceuticals/lupin/L">Lupin</a>, India's third-largest drugmaker said it plans to seek USFDA re-inspection of its Goa and Somerset plants by the first quarter of the calender year 2020.</p>
      <p>"I think there's another two months of work that we want to put in before we put them up for the re-inspection," Nilesh Gupta, Managing Director of Lupin told reporters in a post-earnings conference call.</p>
      <p>While the Goa plant is under a warning letter since 2017 for violation of current good manufacturing practices, the Somerset plant was classified under official action indicated (OAI) status.</p>

      </p>
      <p>USFDA classifies OAI for plants found in an unacceptable state of compliance, attracting agencyâ€™s regulatory and administrative action such as withholding new approvals, warning letters and import alerts.</p>
      <p>Both the warning letter and OAI status put a lid on new approvals.</p>
      <p>Lupin US business has been hit by regulatory issues at four of its plants; Goa, Pithampur Unit-2, Mandideep Unit-1 and Somerset plant, which came into Lupin's fold through Gavis acquisition.</p>
      <p>The regulatory actions have put a lid on several new approvals that are crucial for propelling growth.</p>
      <p>"We're obviously not happy with the total compliance track record that we have at this point," Gupta said.</p>
      <p>Gupta said the drugmaker launched a programme called Quality First, across its entire network of manufacturing sites to upgrade and strengthen quality and compliance systems</p>
      <p>"The programme spans across all our sites, covers people processes, products, SOPs (standard operating procedures), training, it covers everything," Gupta said.</p>
      <p>"There are key sets of people driving each of the initiatives across. Obviously, it's not something that you can complete across the company in six months. But there is a lot of ground that we will cover in Pithampur in the next six months," Gupta said.</p>
      <p>Gupta said Pithampur Unit-2 and Mandideep Unit-will probably be in the second tranche of sites that we will offer for re-inspection.</p>
      <p>To lead the quality function, Lupin appointed Johnny Mikell as President and Global Head of Quality of the company.</p>
      <p>Mikell who was previously heading quality function at Canadian drugmaker Apotex will help steer the company towards enhanced standards of quality and compliance.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
