      <h1>Woody Harrelson says he was ‘mentored’ by Mike Pence, used</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>Actor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/woody-harrelson/">Woody Harrelson</a> on Tuesday elaborated on his past friendship with Vice President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mike Pence</a>, saying he used to be “quite religious” and that the former Indiana governor used to mentor him on Bible-related matters.</p>
      <p>During an interview on comedian Marc Maron’s podcast, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/woody-harrelson/">Mr. Harrelson</a> recalled how he attended Hanover College in Indiana at the same time as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mr. Pence</a> in the early 1980s and how he sought <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mr. Pence</a>’s guidance on a sermon he was set to deliver at the school.</p>
      <p>“I did a sermon when I was 17, and then I did another one at Hanover College,” he said, Yahoo <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/woody-harrelson-on-dining-with-donald-trump-and-giving-sermons-with-mike-pence-012036515.html">reported</a>. “In fact, this is kind of bizarre but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mike Pence</a> was two years older at the same school, at Hanover, and he was the guy who kinda mentored me through it.”</p>
      <p>The “Zombieland” star described <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mr. Pence</a> as the person you went to for help on the subject. He also talked about a grueling dinner he had in 2002 with now-President Trump, Melania Trump and then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.</p>
      <p>“You realize how a second can be fast or a second can feel like forever,” he recalled. “[Mr. Trump] just wants to talk about himself and he does continuously.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/woody-harrelson/">Mr. Harrelson</a> has talked about his 2002 dinner with the Trumps and his relationship to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mr. Pence</a> in the past. In August, he <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/8/woody-harrelson-recalls-brutal-dinner-with-trumps-/">told</a> Esquire that Mr. Trump completely hijacked the conversation during the dinner and gave everyone else at the table very little chance to speak.</p>
      <p>“It got so bad I had to go outside and burn one before returning to the monologue monopoly,” the actor said. “Listen, I came up through Hollywood, so I’ve seen narcissists. This guy was beyond.”</p>
      <p>During the same interview, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/woody-harrelson/">Mr. Harrelson</a> said he remembered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-pence/">Mr. Pence</a> as “nice” and “sincere.”</p>

        <p>“He struck me as a nice guy, very sincere,” he said. “I don’t know how well we’d get along now, but we got along OK then.”</p>
