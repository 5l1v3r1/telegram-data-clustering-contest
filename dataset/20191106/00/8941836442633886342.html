      <p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Authorities say a 51-year-old Florida man groped a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/walt-disney-world-resort/">Walt Disney World</a> worker dressed as a princess during a photo opportunity at the Magic Kingdom.</p>
      <p>An Orange County Sheriff’s Office affidavit says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-sherman/">Brian Sherman</a> and his wife posed for pictures with the woman on Saturday afternoon. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-sherman/">Sherman</a> said the character was his favorite before putting his arm around her and groping her breast.</p>
      <p>The affidavit says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-sherman/">Sherman</a> sat on one side of the woman, and his wife was on the other side. Coworkers told investigators the victim wasn’t able to move before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-sherman/">Sherman</a> groped her. She was crying when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-sherman/">Sherman</a> left the room.</p>
