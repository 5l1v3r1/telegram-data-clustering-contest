      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Church is investigating how two nuns on separate charity missions to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa">Africa</a> became pregnant.</p>
      <p>The nuns were sent to their home countries in Africa from their order in Sicily to complete missionary work, Italian news outlet <a href="http://www.ansa.it/sicilia/notizie/2019/11/01/suora-accusa-dolori-in-ospedale-scopre-di-essere-incinta_4df18622-10e8-43dd-bb66-580c6f6b5490.html">ASNA</a> reported last week.</p>
      <p>One nun, age 34, discovered she was pregnant after she was given an ultrasound following complaints of stomach pains.</p>
      <p>The other nun, a mother superior originally from Madagascar who cared for the elderly, also found herself pregnant, the report said.</p>

      <p>She left the order to return to her home country, the report said. The other is expected to leave the order to raise her child.</p>
      <p>A church official told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10279237/nuns-missionary-work-pregnant/">The Sun</a> an investigation was being opened into the breaching of the "strict rules of chastity."</p>
