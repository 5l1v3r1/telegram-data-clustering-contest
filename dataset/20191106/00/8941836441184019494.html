      <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Snake fungal disease has been confirmed in California for the first time.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Fish and Wildlife says Wednesday testing confirmed the disease in an emaciated California kingsnake found in Amador County. The snake was euthanized.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the department says the fungus was found this week in a Florida watersnake discovered dead in Sacramento County, suggesting the original case wasn’t isolated.</p>
      <p>The department says snake fungal disease is an emerging disease that has been detected in 30 species in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., the fungus has primarily been found in eastern states and the Midwest and was also detected in Idaho last year.</p>
