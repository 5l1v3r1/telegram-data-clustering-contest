      <h1>Engineers Create Tiny 'Artificial Sunflowers' That Bend Towards The Light</h1>

      <p>When it comes to squeezing maximum amounts of energy out of the daylight hours, plants have a head start thanks to evolution.</p>
      <p>Now, engineers have designed solar panels that mimic the sunflower's sun-chasing talent, through clever use of nanotechnology.</p>
      <p>By moulding temperature-sensitive materials into thin, supportive structures, scientists have come up with tiny 'stems' that bend towards a bright light source, providing a moving platform that could dramatically improve the efficiency of a range of solar technologies.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the University of California Los Angeles and Arizona State University refer to their system as a sunflower-like biomimetic omnidirectional tracker. Or 'SunBOT', if you like your acronyms.</p>
      <p>In biological terms, any general movement in response to specific changes in the environment is described as a nastic behaviour. Flowers that open at dawn and close at dusk are a good example of this.</p>
      <p>Chemists have had little trouble making <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19475411.2012.744884">synthetic nastic materials</a> and structures that open and close, or bend and twist in response to changes in light intensity or fluctuating temperatures.</p>
      <p>But nature has another, slightly more complicated behaviour that directs the movements of organisms towards good things and away from threats. </p>
      <p>These tropic behaviours are what we see when sunflowers tilt their flowers to face the Sun, <a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/sunflowers-always-face-follow-sun.html">warming their reproductive bits</a> in order to attract pollinators.</p>
      <p>Sun-chasing actions, or heliotropism, would be mighty handy for things like photovoltaics, which are most efficient when bathed in a dense glow of radiation hitting their surface straight-on, rather than from a more shallow angle.</p>
      <p>In practical terms, compared to rays from an overhead illumination source, light coming in at an angle of around 75 degrees carries as much as 75 percent less energy. </p>
      <p>To solve this problem of oblique-incidence energy-density loss, the research team looked to gels and polymers that respond predictably to light or heat.</p>
      <p>A handful of different materials were selected as candidates worth closer investigation, including a hydrogel containing gold nanoparticles, a tangle of light-sensitive polymers, and a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystalline_elastomer">liquid crystalline elastomer</a> embedded with a light-absorbing dye.</p>
      <p>Each arrangement was shaped into a millimetre-wide thread several centimetres in length. When targeted by a laser, the tiny artificial stalks responded rapidly to the light's warmth, shrinking on one side and expanding on the other to cause the thread to kink and lean towards the laser.</p>
      <p>To put their synthetic sunflowers to the test, the researchers assembled an array of SunBOTs and submerged them in water, letting them sit right at the water-air boundary.</p>
      <p>To detect the harvesting capabilities of their invention, the team then determined how much light was converted to heat by measuring the water vapour their setup generated.</p>
      <p>Changes in the amount of vapour indicated that the SunBOTs were up to four times better at harvesting energy at steep angles than a boring old flat, static surface.</p>
      <p>By demonstrating that a variety of materials could serve as a synthetic tropic material, the researchers argue their devices could potentially be a solution for just about any system that experiences a loss of efficiency due to a moving energy source.</p>
      <p>For example, lawns of these miniature sun-worshippers could theoretically be used to tilt just about any solar process towards the light, from itty-bitty solar cells to evaporation devices that can purify water.</p>
      <p>According to the SunBOTs' designers, the sky (if not beyond!) seems to be the limit for this kind of technology.</p>
      <p>"This work may be useful for enhanced solar harvesters, adaptive signal receivers, smart windows, self-contained robotics, solar sails for spaceships, guided surgery, self-regulating optical devices, and intelligent energy generation (for example, solar cells and biofuels), as well as energetic emission detection and tracking with telescopes, radars and hydrophones," <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-019-0562-3">they write in their report</a>.</p>
      <p>Even if just a handful of those predictions eventuates into real-world use, the future of synthetic tropic materials is certainly looking brighter.</p>
