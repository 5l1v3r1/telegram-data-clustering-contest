      <p>After sitting on the market for several years, “The Pinnacle” penthouse at the top of New York City’s famed Woolworth Building is relisted with its first furnished renderings and a lower price.Originally listed for $110 million in 2017, the property, which spans the top five floors of the tower, is now priced at $79 million.</p>
      <p>Though the home is offered as a fully-unfurnished “white-box” unit, developer Alchemy Properties hired award-winning architect David Hotson to create renderings of its interiors. Since the unit has a cylindrical layout, the new photos aim to help potential buyers envision living in the uniquely-shaped space.</p>

      <p>Hotson is known for designing the Skyhouse penthouse at 150 Nassau St., which was awarded “Best Apartment of the Decade” by <i>Interior Design</i> magazine in 2015</p>
      <p>Commissioned by F.W. Woolworth and designed by Cass Gilbert, the 58-story Woolworth Building was the tallest structure in the world when it was completed in 1913.  Alchemy Properties, together with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heathersenison/2019/02/22/the-next-park-avenue-a-look-at-manhattans-newest-residential-corridors/#7e3cf01d39e3">French architect Thierry W. Despont</a>, renovated 106-year-old landmark’s tower into 32 condos, which have a starting price of $2.85 million.</p>
      <p>Sales for the condos are being handled by Alchemy Properties, and Stan Ponte and Joshua Judge of Sotheby's International Realty.</p>

      <p>The 9,680-square-foot penthouse, which occupies floors 50 through 55, features a private 408-square-foot observatory on the 58th level, along with exclusive elevator access, 24-foot ceilings and more than 125 windows.</p>
      <p>“The Pinnacle at The Woolworth Tower Residences has been described by some as a ‘castle in the sky’ and by others as the ‘highest mansion in Manhattan,’” Ponte and Judge said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“However a buyer may think of the space, it is ultimately a home, and the renderings and proposed design by award-winning architect David Hotson allows potential purchasers to understand how they could live in this penthouse of penthouses,” they said. “In particular, David Hotson’s brilliant use of vertical sight-lines, floor plans that maximize light and air, breathtaking floating staircases and internal elevators have literally ‘elevated’ the space from a landmark penthouse to a piece of art.”</p>

      <p>Amenities in the building include a lounge and entertaining area, a wine cellar and tasting room, a gym, and a 50-foot saltwater pool.</p>
      <p>On the ground floor, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heathersenison/2019/03/08/historic-new-york-ceilings-restored-to-old-new-york-grandeur/#6f4c7bc57466">original coffered ceiling from Woolworth’s personal office</a> on the 40th floor was restored and relocated to the condo’s private lobby at the 2 Park Place entrance. To bring the ceiling back to its original grandeur, Alchemy Properties brought in artisans from Canada, who cleaned each coffer with a cocktail of baby shampoo and seaweed, while reinforcing their backings with Kevlar.</p>
