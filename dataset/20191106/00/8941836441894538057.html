      <h1>Mayor: Roxbury residents support ‘Nubian Square’ name chan</h1>

      <p>BOSTON (AP) - An effort to rename the square in a historically black <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a> neighborhood to Nubian Square isn’t dead, despite the failure of a citywide referendum.</p>
      <p>Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh said Wednesday that voters in the Roxbury neighborhood, where the name change is being proposed, overwhelmingly approved the proposal to rename Dudley Square in Tuesday’s election.</p>
      <p>His office said 1,986 Roxbury residents voted in favor of the non-binding referendum to 957 against. The ballot question failed citywide, with 46% in favor and 54% against.</p>
      <p>Because of the strong support in Roxbury, Walsh said his office will be meeting with name change advocates to discuss next steps.</p>
      <p>“I am proud of the community for their continued advocacy on this issue,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press.</p>

      <p>Walsh said among the next steps is having the Nubian Square Coalition officially petition the city’s Public Improvement Commission for the name change.</p>
      <p>Supporters argue the commercial center should be renamed because Roxbury resident Thomas Dudley was a leading politician when Massachusetts legally sanctioned slavery in the 1600s.</p>
      <p>But opponents counter that slavery was also part of the ancient Nubian empire, which ruled over swaths of modern-day Egypt and Sudan thousands of years ago.</p>
      <p>Roxbury is the neighborhood where a young Martin Luther King, Jr. preached and Malcolm X grew up.</p>

        <p>It remains a center of the state’s African American community. More than 50% of its roughly 60,000 residents are black, according to census data.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston/">Boston</a> has debated a number of name changes in recent years as the city reconciles with its slavery ties and racist past.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Red Sox successfully petitioned to change the name of Yawkey Way near Fenway Park back to the original Jersey Street.</p>
        <p>Under longtime team owner Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox were the last Major League Baseball franchise to integrate.</p>
        <p>Other groups have also been calling for years for the city to rename Faneuil Hall , downtown landmark built by Peter Faneuil, a wealthy 18th-century slave owner.</p>
        <p>They’ve suggested the famous hall - where leading colonists debated independence from England - after Crispus Attucks, a black man killed during the Boston Massacre.</p>
        <p>Attucks is considered the first casualty of the American Revolution.</p>
