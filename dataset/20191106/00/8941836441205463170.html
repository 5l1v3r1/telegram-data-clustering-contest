      <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - South Korean has offered to send a delegation to check on South Korean-built facilities at a long-stalled joint tourist resort in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a>, Seoul said Wednesday, as the North is pushing to tear them down.</p>
      <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently ordered the destruction of South Korean-made hotels and other facilities at the North’s Diamond Mountain resort, saying they appear “shabby” and “unpleasant-looking.”</p>
      <p>Seoul’s Unification Ministry sent a message Tuesday proposing a delegation dispatch to conduct safety checks on those facilities, but ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> hasn’t responded. He said the dates for a delegation trip to the mountain could be determined through consultations with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a>.</p>
      <p>South Korea earlier proposed face-to-face talks on the issue. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> has rejected that and insisted on document exchanges.</p>
      <p>South Korean-run tours to the mountain resort, once a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation projects, was halted in 2008 when a North Korean soldier fatally shot a South Korean tourist who the North says entered a restricted area. The tours had been a source of hard currency for the impoverished country.</p>

        <p>The latest development on the mountain tours comes amid a standstill in a U.S.-led diplomacy aimed at depriving <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> of its nuclear weapons. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> has earlier called for the tours’ restart, but South Korea couldn’t do so while international sanctions remain in place over the North’s nuclear program.</p>
