      <h4>A century and a half of research and discovery</h4>
      <p>This week is a really special one for all of us at <i>Nature</i>: it’s 150 years since our first issue, published in November 1869. (That makes it our sesquicentenary, by the way.) We’ve been working for well over a year on our anniversary issue, which is published today. There was a buzz in the London office when the print issue landed on our desks this morning, and we’re just as excited about what you’ll find online.</p>
      <p>It’s been humbling and rewarding to look back at the amazing research that we’ve helped to communicate over that time. It reminded us all why we love science and work as hard as we do. We really hope you find some surprises in the issue. And we’re already planning how we can do better, and do even more for science, scientists and society, next year — when we’re 151.</p>

      <p>A century and a half has seen momentous changes in science, and <i>Nature </i>has changed along with it in many ways, says <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03304-x">an Editorial in today’s anniversary edition</a>. But in other respects, <i>Nature </i>now is just the same as it was at the start: it will continue in its mission to stand up for research, serve the global research community and communicate the results of science around the world.</p>
      <p><i>Nature </i>would also like to hear from you about how we can improve — <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03304-x">please tell us your thoughts in the poll</a> included at the end of the Editorial.</p>

Droegemeier’s first major project since taking on his role in February comes amid government investigations into sexual harassment in academia, conflicts of interest and foreign influence in research. “I am hopeful that their efforts to go through this process reflect serious attempts to listen, and are not just theatre,” says chief scientific officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges, Ross McKinney.</p>

      <p>South Korea’s government wants to stop academics from participating in conferences that have little academic value. Universities will have to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03372-z">vet academics’ plans to travel overseas for conferences</a> to “prevent researchers from engaging in poor academic activities”. The order comes after a government report found that 574 professors from 90 universities around the country had participated in conferences that the ministry called “weak”.</p>

      <p>There were female scientists 150 years ago, but to read <i>Nature</i>’s early issues, you would hardly have known it. Historian Claire Jones looks at how women, including those who aren’t lauded today like Curie or Lovelace, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03361-2">carved out scientific careers in a time</a> when learned societies, journals and universities were often hostile or closed to them.</p>
