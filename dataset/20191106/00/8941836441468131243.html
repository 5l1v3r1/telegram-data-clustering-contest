      <p>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) - Winnipeg Jets forward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bryan-little/">Bryan Little</a> remained hospitalized Wednesday, a day after being struck near the ear by a puck.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bryan-little/">Little</a> was skating behind the net midway through the third period in a 2-1 home loss to New Jersey when teammate Nikolaj Ehlers fired a rising slap shot from the point. The puck hit Little on his left side and he fell to the ice, putting his head in his hands as blood dripped.</p>
