      <p>Emma Watson, originally of <i>Harry Potter </i>fame, spoke to activist Paris Lee for <i>British Vogue</i> about the pressures of starring in the franchise, her fears on turning 30, and her activism for the magazine’s <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-december-issue-british-vogue-2019">December 2019 edition</a>. The edition will feature Emma Watson on its cover.August 2020 will mark 20 years since <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/890287.stm">Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint</a> were cast as the core trio of characters in the <i>Harry Potter </i>film series. They went on to star in eight movies, taking them on a journey lasting over a decade, ending with <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2</i> in July 2011.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Paris Lee for <i>Vogue</i>, Watson opened up on her experience since <i>Harry Potter</i>, saying she decided to go to therapy to sort through her thoughts and feelings of guilt about starring as Hermione Granger in the franchise:</p>
      <p>“I’ve sat in therapy and felt really guilty about it. I’m like, why me? Somebody else would have enjoyed and wanted this aspect of it more than I did. And I’ve struggled a lot with the guilt around that. I’m like, I should be enjoying this a lot more, I should be more excited and I’m actually really struggling.”</p>
      <p>It’s refreshing to see somebody of Watson’s fame and history given the opportunity to be candid about her experience of the pressures of being in a role with such high expectations from the age of eleven. Whilst the world saw her as Hermione Granger for over a decade, Watson said remaining rooted in her own identity helped her eventually “find peace”:</p>
      <p>“Part of what’s helped me find peace is there were moments when it got so big where I almost had vertigo and felt it got so big that I felt l disconnected, and part of the peace within myself is remembering my identity.</p>
      <p>“I am someone’s daughter. I am my mother’s daughter, I am my father’s daughter, I am a sister. I belong to a family. I come from a place, I have roots. There’s a whole big existence and identity that I have that’s really important and weighted and solid, that has nothing to do with any of that.”</p>

      <p>Since <i>Harry Potter</i>, Daniel Radcliffe has starred in projects on stage and screen, from <i>Equus</i> on the West End and Broadway and <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead </i>at The Old Vic<i>, </i>to<i> 2</i>012<i> </i>movie<i> The Woman In Black</i>, and lately TV series <i>Miracle Workers, </i>on which he served as executive producer on several episodes. Rupert Grint appeared in 2017 TV series <i>Sick Note</i>, served as producer and star in ongoing TV series, <i>Snatch</i>, and will star in <i>Servant</i>, which he discussed on a panel at New York Comic Con 2019.</p>
      <p>Emma Watson has had arguably the most diverse and impressive career since ending <i>Harry Potter</i>, seeing her go from starring in the 2012 movie adaptation of <i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower, </i>to bringing to life a new imagining of Disney’s Belle in the live-action remake of <i>Beauty and the Beast </i>in 2017. She will also star as Margaret “Meg” March in Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of <i>Little Women </i>this Christmas, calling the character a feminist for her decisiveness:</p>
      <p> “Her choice is that she wants to be a full-time mother and wife. To Jo [Saoirse Ronan], being married is really some sort of prison sentence. But Meg says, ‘You know, I love him [John Brooke, who is played by James Norton] and I’m really happy and this is what I want. And just because my dreams are different from yours, it doesn’t mean they’re unimportant.”</p>
      <p>Outside of her acting career since <i>Harry Potter,</i> Emma Watson has given her voice and platform to women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and sustainability campaigns. She serves as <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/partnerships/goodwill-ambassadors/emma-watson">UN Women Goodwill Ambassador</a>, advocating the <a href="https://www.heforshe.org/en">HeforShe</a> campaign to end gender inequality. Watson kicked off the campaign at a special event at the<a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/emma-watson-gender-equality-is-your-issue-too"> UN Headquarters in 2014</a> with a rousing, bold speech on being a feminist and ending sexual harassment, closing with a memorable call to action: “Ask yourself–if not me, who? If not now, when?”</p>
      <p>She has since served on global summit panels for years, and and earlier this year sat down with <a href="https://www.mukwegefoundation.org/2019/05/video-emma-watson-in-conversation-with-dr-mukwege/">Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Denis Mukwege</a> in London for a sombre conversation organised by New York Times about gender-based violence, and Mukwege’s work as a human rights activist and doctor working to end the use of rape as a weapon of war.</p>
      <p>Watson also contributed to the original <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46766149">TimesUp</a> campaign and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45818699">#MeToo fund</a> to support victims of sexual harassment after <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2017/10/08/harvey-weinstein-fired-from-the-weinstein-company/">Harvey Weinstein</a> was exposed by several women in the movie industry for subjecting them to sexual harassment and assault. She also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/emma-watson-launches-workplace-harassment-legal-advice-line">set up a hotline </a>for victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
      <p>Telling Lee about the <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-on-fame-activism-little-women">perceived struggles of turning 30</a>, and her newfound happiness in being single (which she calls being self-partnered in an effort to reclaim the happier parts of being single), she said:</p>
      <p>“I was like, ‘Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30? This is not a big deal…’” she shares. “Cut to 29, and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I feel so stressed and anxious. And I realise it’s because there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around. If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you’re still figuring things out… There’s just this incredible amount of anxiety.”</p>
