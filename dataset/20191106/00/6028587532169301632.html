      <p>Facebook said late Tuesday that roughly 100 developers may have improperly accessed user data, which includes the names and profile pictures of individuals in certain Facebook Groups.The company <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2019/11/05/changes-groups-api-access/">explained in a blog post</a> that developers primarily of social media management and video-streaming apps retained the ability to access Facebook Group member information longer than the company intended.</p>
      <p>The company did not detail the type of data that was improperly accessed beyond names and photos, and it did not disclose the number of users affected by the leak.</p>
      <p>Facebook restricted its developer APIs—which provide a way for apps to interface with Facebook data—in April 2018, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke the month before. The goal was to reduce the way in which developers could gather large swaths of data from Facebook users.</p>
      <p>But the company’s sweeping changes have been relatively ineffective. More than a year after the company restricted API access, the company continues to announce newly discovered data leaks.</p>
      <p>“Although we’ve seen no evidence of abuse, we will ask them to delete any member data they may have retained and we will conduct audits to confirm that it has been deleted,” Facebook said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The social media giant says in its announcement that it reached out to 100 developer partners who may have improperly accessed user data and says that at least 11 developer partners accessed the user data within the last 60 days.</p>
      <p>Facebook has been reviewing the ways that companies are able to collect information and personal data about its users since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html"><i>New York Times</i> reported</a> that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested data of millions of users. Facebook later said the firm connected to the Trump campaign may have improperly accessed data on 87 million users.</p>
      <p>The Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mnunez/2019/07/24/ftcs-unprecedented-slap-fines-facebook-5-billion-forces-new-privacy-controls/#13f0183c5668">$5 billion fine</a> as a result of the breach. As part of the 20-year agreement both parties reached, Facebook now faces new guidelines for how it handles privacy leaks.</p>
      <p>“The new framework under our agreement with the FTC means more accountability and transparency into how we build and maintain products,” Facebook’s director of platform partnerships, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=678106196&amp;story_fbid=10157721394281197">Facebook post</a>.</p>
      <p>“As we work through this process we expect to find examples like the Groups API of where we can improve; rest assured we are committed to this work and supporting the people on our platform.”</p>
