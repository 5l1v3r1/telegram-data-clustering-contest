      <p>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - The head of the North Dakota agency that promotes tourism and economic development has hired an attorney after a critical audit of the agency.</p>
      <p>Commerce Director Michelle Kommer told the Legislative Audit and Fiscal Review Committee Wednesday that she hired the lawyer in the wake of an audit released last month.</p>
      <p>Among the findings was that the agency violated the law on bidding uncompetitive contracts totaling more than $87,000 for the state’s new “Be Legendary” logo. Kommer says the agency did nothing wrong.</p>
      <p>The audit also alleged the agency improperly charged more than $850,000 to a wrong two-year budget cycle. The audit says the agency incorrectly made payments totaling nearly $124,000 to unapproved subcontractors.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem has called on South Dakota authorities to help investigate the agency.</p>
