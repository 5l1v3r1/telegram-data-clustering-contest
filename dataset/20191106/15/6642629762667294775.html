      <p>British Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> urged voters to back his Conservatives in a December 12 election or face the "horror show" of two referendums next year if Labour's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/jeremy-corbyn.html">Jeremy Corbyn</a> were elected.</p>
      <p>Officially launching the start of campaign from outside his Downing Street residence, Johnson said that if he were returned to power with a majority he would get on with ratifying his <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> deal straight away.</p>
      <p>"Come with us, get Brexit done and take this country forward, or, and this is the alternative next year, spend the whole of 2020 in a horror show of yet more dither and delay," he said.</p>
      <p>"[Labour] would spend the whole of 2020 having two referendums, one on Scotland ... and another referendum on Brexit."</p>
