      <h1>Jeremy Clarkson's plans to build Diddly Squat farm shop approved amid neighbour fury</h1>

      <p>Jeremy Clarkson has had controversial plans to build a 'Diddly Squat' farm shop on his country estate APPROVED.</p>
      <p>The presenter's new project was met with fierce objection by locals who feared it could kill off nearby businesses when first pitched earlier this year.</p>
      <p>But the scheme was given the green light by council officers yesterday (Tues) - leaving the 59-year-old free to start building.</p>
      <p>The staunch Remainer has already received EU funding for his farm in Chadlington, Oxon. - which he has dubbed 'Diddly Squat' due to its poor crop yields.</p>

      <p>The new development will include the "erection of a lambing shed and farm shop, including car parking and associated landscaping" which has "potential for occasional film-making", according to documents.</p>
      <p>Conditions for the build include proper access routes, a surfaced car park and an agreement not to film for more than nine months in a 27-month period.</p>
      <p>The former Top Gear host is currently making a farming show for Amazon Prime based on his experiences as an "inept townie".</p>

      <p>But a planning statement published in July on behalf of Mr Clarkson said: "The primary reason for the proposed lambing shed and farm shop is to allow Diddly Squat Farm to diversify.</p>
      <p>"The buildings will therefore be constructed regardless of whether filming takes place."</p>
      <p>A statement from the local parish council, submitted in September, said: "Chadlington Parish Council has no objection to this application as long as filming is for farming activities only and local produce only is sold."</p>

      <p>It also raised concerns about potential traffic hazards.</p>
      <p>Numerous locals spoke about about the development prior to approval - fearing the presenter would damage the area's appeal.</p>
      <p>But an email from a business development officer at West Oxfordshire District Council said Mr Clarkson's farm was "heavily reliant on the EU Basic Payment Scheme and has to plan ahead".</p>
      <p>He added that it was "completely appropriate for the business to look at diversification".</p>

      <p>Speaking to the BBC previously, Mr Clarkson said he didn't "blame" residents for their concerns - adding "otherwise what is the point in planning permission".</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>According to documents published online, the farm shop can sell goods made on the site and goods made by local producers - as long as the local authority has sanctioned the sale first.</p>
      <p>This is so as to keep within the council's definition of 'local producer', which is someone based solely within West Oxfordshire boundaries.</p>
      <p>The roof of the shop must also be covered in "materials" approved by the local authority.</p>
      <p>A previous planning statement said the buildings would not be "as incongruous features in the wider Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty".</p>
