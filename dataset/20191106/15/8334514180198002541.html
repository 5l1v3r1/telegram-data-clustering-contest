      <p>NAIROBI (Reuters) - A group of Kenyan banks on Wednesday committed 10 billion Kenyan shillings ($97 million) in loans to small and medium businesses under a new mobile phone-based loan service targeting a fast-growing segment which has traditionally been under-served.</p>

      <p>Mobile phone-based lending has grown in the East African nation, mainly due to the success of telecom operator Safaricom’s M-Pesa platform, the world’s first such service pioneered in 2007.</p>
      <p>Known as Stawi, the service has garnered 100,000 customers who have already borrowed 100 million shillings during a trial phase started in May, the Kenya Bankers’ Association said.</p>
      <p>It is now looking to lend 10 billion shillings in the next phase, it said, without giving a timeframe.</p>
      <p>Stawi is backed by KCB Group (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/KCB.NR">KCB.NR</a>), NCBA Bank (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NCBA.NR">NCBA.NR</a>), Cooperative Bank of Kenya (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/COOP.NR">COOP.NR</a>) and Diamond Trust Bank (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/DTK.NR">DTK.NR</a>).</p>
      <p>Businesses which sign up can borrow between 30,000 shillings and 250,000 shillings, at a 9% annual interest rate - equal to the central bank rate - with repayment periods of one month to 12 months, the association said.</p>
      <p>“It will use customer transactions to generate reliable data to assess the creditworthiness of these enterprises,” President Uhuru Kenyatta told a formal launch ceremony for Stawi.</p>
      <p>KCB and NCBA already offer personal lending and savings on mobile phones together with Safaricom (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SCOM.NR">SCOM.NR</a>) using its M-Pesa platform.</p>
      <p>Small and medium businesses have long complained about a lack of access to credit, or of being charged high interest rates due to a perception by lenders that they are too risky.</p>
      <p>The situation has been compounded by a cap on commercial lending rates, which parliament decided to remove on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>At least 1 million customers were shut out of lending by banks when the government imposed the rate cap in 2016, the bankers’ association said, as lenders deemed them too risky.</p>
      <p>Lending to small and medium-sized businesses dropped by 1.9 trillion shillings since the cap was imposed, it added.</p>
      <p>The government says small and medium enterprises account for more than 80% of all the businesses in the country, provide about 75% of jobs, and about 30% of the annual gross domestic product.</p>
      <p>Kenyatta warned bankers against shunning lending to the sector in favor of relatively safer government bonds.</p>
