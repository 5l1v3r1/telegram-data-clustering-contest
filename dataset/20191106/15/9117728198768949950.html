      <p>Speaking to talkSPORT, Jordan said: <i>“Everyone has their own view on this, but I am of the view he’s already surpassed Michael.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Michael started with me so there is a love affair there, but there is a situation some people may not fully grasp.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“At the time I handled people like [Rubens] Barrichello, [Eddie] Irvine, [Giancarlo] Fisichella and [Jean] Alesi, and every time we went to sign a contract with Michael Schumacher or Ferrari it always had conditions in it, where what we saw in Austin wouldn’t have been allowed to happen.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Lewis, if he had in his contract the same things, he would have had to been able to pass [Valtteri] Bottas [to win the race].</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You can’t have that in a competitive sport, where one part of the team dictates to the other. For me, that is a flaw factor for Michael.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Seven World Championships… how many would he have won if he hadn’t had the influence and support of the other people in the team?"</i>
      </p>
