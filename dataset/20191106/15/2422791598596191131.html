      <p>TORONTO -- Barrick Gold Corp. raised its dividend as it reported a third-quarter profit boosted by a one-time gain related to its Turquoise Ridge mine, which is part of its Nevada Gold Mines venture with Newmont Goldcorp Corp.</p>
      <p>The gold miner says it will raise its quarterly dividend by a penny to a nickel per share, helped by its operational performance and a growth in cash flows.</p>
      <p>The increased payment to shareholders came as Barrick, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, said it earned nearly US$2.28 billion or $1.30 per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from a loss of $412 million or 35 cents per share a year ago.</p>
      <p>Revenue totalled $2.68 billion, up from $1.84 billion in the same quarter last year before the company merged with Randgold Resources Ltd.</p>
      <p>On an adjusted basis, Barrick says it earned $264 million or 15 cents per share in its most recent quarter compared with an adjusted profit of $89 million or eight cents per share in the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>Analysts on average had expected a profit of 11 cents per share on $2.82 billion in revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
