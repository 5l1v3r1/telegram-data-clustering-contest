      <p>A SIM deal offering 45GB of data for just £15 is undercutting the major mobile networks as Black Friday gets near.</p>
      <p>Smarty, which uses the Three network, is selling <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=10933&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Smarty&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsmarty.co.uk%252Fplans%252Flarge%253Futm_campaign%253Dawin%2526utm_medium%253Daffiliates%2526utm_source%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.digidip.net%25252F%2526utm_content%253DDiscount%252BCode%2526awc%253D10933_1573053351_016ad96d9dfeec9d45f47f7bbdc3a520%5D%5D">45GB of data for the price of 8GB</a> and has also thrown in a host of extras to entice customers to switch from the likes of O2, Vodafone, GiffGaff and Three before Black Friday.</p>
      <p>It says if users do not use all of the data each month they will cut up to £10 from the next month's bill, meaning users could be paying just £5 for the SIM.</p>
      <p>The is a one-month contract so can be stopped at any time and the 45GB data limit will be in place for the first 12 months of use - just in time for Black Friday 2020.</p>
      <p>The contract also comes with unlimited calls and texts and is available online <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=10933&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Smarty&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsmarty.co.uk%252Fplans%252Flarge%253Futm_campaign%253Dawin%2526utm_medium%253Daffiliates%2526utm_source%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.digidip.net%25252F%2526utm_content%253DDiscount%252BCode%2526awc%253D10933_1573053351_016ad96d9dfeec9d45f47f7bbdc3a520%5D%5D">here.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But how does it stack up against the rest of the industry's <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/black-friday-sim-mobile-deals-17171697">Black Friday SIM deals</a> ?</p>
      <p>The answer is surprisingly well. Three is currently offering <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=10210&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Smarty&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.three.co.uk%252FStore%252FSIM%252FPlans_for_phones%5D%5D">unlimited data for £20 a month</a> but that deal ties you in to a 24-month contract. Unlimited data for 12 months is £21 per month. Even the hefty 30GB deal is priced at £18 a month.</p>
      <p>Three has been known to drop the price of an unlimited SIM to as little as £10 and with Black Friday coming up users may want to hold off to get an equivalent deal.</p>
      <p>Vodafone's unlimited SIM is <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=1257&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Smarty&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.vodafone.co.uk%252Fmobile%252Fbest-sim-only-deals%5D%5D">£23 per month</a> , while 20GB of data is £20 per month. EE is selling <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=5571&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Smarty&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fshop.ee.co.uk%252Fsim-only%252Fpay-monthly-phones%5D%5D">50GB of data</a> for £24 per month and 25GB of data for £20 per month.</p>
      <p>The major phone companies cannot compete with Smarty at the moment but should offer cheaper deals for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>However, BT is offering a <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=3041&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Smarty&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bt.com%252Fmobile%252Fsim-only-deals%252F%5D%5D">30GB deal for £17.</a> The deal also comes with BT Sport on mobile, extra speed 4G and a free JBL speaker worth £119. It is also offering a 100GB version for £20 a month and a 20GB version for just £14 a month with the speaker freebie and BT Sport.</p>
      <p>The deals are even cheaper if you already have BT Broadband and it could be the main competitor to the Smarty deal.</p>
