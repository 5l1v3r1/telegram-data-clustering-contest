      <p>Tributes were pouring in on Wednesday for trail runner and animal lover Wesley Sweetnam who was killed in an apparent house robbery in Noordhoek, Cape Town. </p>
      <p>"Along with Wesley's endurance and astonishing talent, he was known for his soft heart, big smile and even bigger personality," said company K-Way. </p>
      <p>Sweetnam was one of the <a href="http://www.kway.co.za/team-view/wesley-sweetnam/">company's ambassadors</a>, and was famous for his trail running, including the Otter Run. </p>

      <p>"He was a ray of sunshine and an inspiration to many - for truly living his life to the fullest," the company wrote on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"We extend our condolences to the friends and family of Wesley. Know, that you are in our thoughts and forever part of our family." </p>
      <p>Western Cape police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut said: "The circumstances surrounding the death of a 30-year-old male are being investigated after he was shot and killed at his Noordhoek residence on Sunday morning at around 05:50 by an unknown suspect who is yet to be arrested.</p>
      <p>"The motive for the murder is suspected to be robbery."</p>
      <p>Just days ago, the company was wishing Sweetnam well for an event. </p>

      <p>K-Way's biography of Sweetnam describes him as a person who loved nature and the outdoors, hiking mountains above Kalk Bay as a child with his brother and father, and moving on to challenging trail runs.</p>

      <p>His Facebook profile was turned into a place of condolences, with one person writing: "We just lost a super gem," and another saying: "The magnitude of the loss of your life is indescribable."</p>
      <p>The company's Facebook page showed the fundraising and outreach that he and the co-owner did for pets living with less fortunate families.</p>
