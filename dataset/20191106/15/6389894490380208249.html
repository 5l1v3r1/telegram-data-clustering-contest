      <h1>Crispin Odey quits Jupiter short position as wife Nichola Pease appointed chair</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:26:42+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Menin</a></address>
      <p>Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey has ended his short position in Jupiter Fund Management after his wife, veteran fund manager Nichola Pease, was appointed chair of the group.</p>
      <p>Jupiter announced today that Pease will take over as its non-executive chairman when Liz Airey steps down in March.</p>
      <p>Regulatory filings had shown that Odey’s hedge fund, Odey Asset Management, held a short position in Jupiter as late as 31 October – the last date for which information is available.</p>
      <p>But Odey confirmed to <i>City A.M.</i> that his firm no longer has a short position in Jupiter. Odey said he had ended his short position in Jupiter by Monday, adding: “it was time to get out of it”.</p>
      <p>Odey also confirmed his firm will not trade in Jupiter shares while Pease remains in position there. A similar arrangement had been in place while Pease sat on the board of Jupiter rival Schroders.</p>
      <p>“We’ll have no position in Jupiter from now on,” Odey told <i>City A.M.</i></p>
      <p>Odey first disclosed a short position of 0.97 per cent in the FTSE 250 fund manager in February, and filings show the position has fluctuated since then.</p>
      <p>Odey had been gradually reducing the position since mid-October, when it rose to one per cent.</p>
      <p>Pease and Odey are worth a combined £775m, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list.</p>
      <p>Pease’s appointment comes at a time of significant management change for Jupiter, after chief executive Andrew Formica joined in March and Wayne Mepham joined as chief financial officer in September.</p>
      <p>Jupiter senior independent director Jonathan Bond said Pease was an “outstanding successor to our outgoing Chairman and brings significant relevant experience to the board.”</p>
      <p>“At a time when Jupiter is moving forward under new leadership and with a refreshed plan to grow the business, Nichola’s industry expertise will prove invaluable.”</p>
      <p>“Jupiter is an exceptional firm with a high-quality team and an ambitious strategy to build the business over the next five years. I look forward to joining the Board at a very exciting time for the business,” said Bond.</p>
      <p>He also thanked Airey for her work with Jupiter, saying: “We have benefitted immensely from her long and successful stewardship”.</p>
      <p>Pease said: “Jupiter is an exceptional firm with a high-quality team and an ambitious strategy to build the business over the next five years. I look forward to joining the Board at a very exciting time for the business.”</p>
      <p>Results released in July showed Jupiter had recorded a modest first-half improvement under Formica, but outflows of client cash continued following the loss of a star fund manager earlier in the year.</p>
