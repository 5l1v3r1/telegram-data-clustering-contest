      <p>Here at Undercard Superstar, we’re in the business of your business! Just follow our sound betting advice, and you too can refer to yourself as <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1191686317614227456">self-sheltered</a> after my betting advice leaves you without a home!</p>
      <p>As usual, we’ll take a hundred dollars and divide it among five fights.</p>
      <p>Let’s make some cashola.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Alexander Volkov -280 over Greg Hardy ($35)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Zabit Magomedsharipov -285 over Calvin Kattar ($20)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rustam Khabilov -170 over Sergey Khandozhko ($10)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>KSI +160 over Logan Paul ($5)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Grigorii Popov -205 over Davey Grant ($30)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A failsafe is that if Hardy finds himself in trouble, he’ll find a way to get himself DQ’d or turn it into a no-contest, so you’re bound to at least break even! Heavy money!</p>
      <p>Magomedsharipov, much like his Dagestanian fighting brothers are icy-cold brutally efficient war machines, not to ever be confused with War Machine.</p>
      <p> </p>

        <b>Last Week: $ +5.53</b>
        <br/>
        <b>Year To Date: $ -128.31</b>
