      <p>(NEWPORT NEWS, Va.) — A Democratic candidate who lost a random drawing that determined control of the Virginia House of Delegates nearly two years ago has won a rematch against her Republican opponent.</p>
      <p>Shelly Simonds defeated four-term Del. David Yancey handily Tuesday in a race for the 94th District in Newport News.</p>

      <p>The close 2017 race between the two went to a recount, then to court. Eventually, officials used the luck of the draw, placing the name of each candidate on a piece of paper and each piece of paper in a separate film canister. The canisters were put into a cobalt blue-and-white ceramic bowl made by a local artist and stirred around. The canister containing Yancey’s name was drawn, giving him the win.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Simonds won nearly 58% of the vote. Yancey won about 40%.</p>
