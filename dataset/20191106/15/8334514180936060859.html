      <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has approved European lawmaker Adina Valean as the commissioner-designate for Romania, a spokesperson for the transition team told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Romania’s centrist government had nominated Sigfriend Muresan, another European lawmaker, alongside Valean.</p>
      <p>“Both candidates had interviews with the President-elect and did well. The President-elect decided for Adina Valean to take on the portfolio of transport”, a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Valean will have to face European lawmakers on November 14 in Brussels before her nomination can be formally confirmed. The objective is still for the new 28-nations bloc’s executive to start as of Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>The United Kingdom has yet to name a candidate.</p>
