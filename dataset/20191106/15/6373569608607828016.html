      <h1>Schoolgirl 'vomited' after bus driver ordered her off for being 10p short</h1>
      <h2>The 13-year-old, who suffers from anxiety, was left distressed by the incident</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:01:35+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Humphries, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>A schoolgirl was ordered off a bus by a driver for being 10p short.</p>
      <p>The girl, 13, suffers with anxiety, and was so distressed by the incident she vomited in the street afterwards.</p>
      <p>The bus driver allegedly kept her money, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/schoolgirl-ordered-bus-being-10p-17206842">Liverpool Echo</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Dad of the traumatised girl Gary Jones, 52, said he was "fuming" about the incident and wanted a written apology from the driver.</p>
      <p>She was getting on the Arriva bus in Bootle at around 7.30am on Wednesday, October 23, when the unsavoury incident occurred.</p>

      <p>Mr Jones said: "She got on and she handed over her money and the driver said 'you're 10p short, you will have to get off the bus'.</p>
      <p>"She just got off on Southport Road but he kept her money as well. She suffers with anxiety and I have taken her to the doctors, and she threw up while she was walking away.</p>
      <p>"I had to get my older daughter to take her to school.</p>
      <p>"It is out of order, it isn't right."</p>
      <p>Mr Jones says he contacted  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/arriva-north-wes">Arriva</a>  the same day and was told customer services would look into the incident and respond within 10 days.</p>
      <p>After the ECHO contacted Arriva, Mr Jones claims he received a phone call offering a three month bus pass and an apology.</p>
      <p>He said: "They told me the driver was being dealt with in a disciplinary but they couldn't tell me the details.</p>
      <p>"I wanted an explanation of why he done it and a written apology, but they won't give me that."</p>
      <p>When contacted by the ECHO a spokeswoman for Arriva said they could not comment on internal disciplinary cases.</p>
