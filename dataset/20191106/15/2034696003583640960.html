        <b>The Hollywood star was speaking about her struggles with addiction</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jamie Lee Curtis has spoken about her problems with drug addiction in a new interview, and spoke about once taking cocaine and freebasing with her Dad, actor Tony Curtis.</p>
      <p>Speaking as part of <a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/features/jamie-lee-curtis-sober-recovery-addiction-1203392102/"><i>Variety</i></a>‘s ‘Recovery’ issue, which sees stars talking about issues surrounding addiction, the actor discussed being 20 years sober and detailed one particular story from her past.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“I knew my dad had an issue because I had an issue and he and I shared drugs,” Curtis said, before expanding: “I did cocaine and freebased once with my dad. But that was the only time I did that, and I did that with him.”</p>
      <p>She added that “drugs were very much a family problem”.</p>

      <p>Continuing to discuss her addiction, Curtis said: “I was the wildly controlled drug addict and alcoholic. I never did it when I worked. I never took drugs before 5 p.m. I never, ever took painkillers at 10 in the morning.</p>
      <p>“It was that sort of late afternoon and early evening — I like to refer to it as the warm-bath feeling of an opiate. It’s like the way you naturally feel when your body is cool, and you step into a warm bath, and you sink into it. That’s the feeling for me, what an opiate gave me, and I chased that feeling for a long time.”</p>
      <p>Curtis is set to star in Halloween Kills, the latest instalment in the horror series, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/jamie-lee-curtis-shares-first-glimpse-halloween-kills-2555548">shared a glimpse of progress on the film last month</a> as filming began.</p>
      <p>“I do not like horror movies,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/film-interviews/jamie-lee-curtis-interview-2018-halloween-2390925">she admitted to <i>NME</i> in an interview last year</a>.</p>
