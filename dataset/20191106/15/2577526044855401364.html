      <h1>Doom Meets Borderlands in Cunningly-Named Crossover Mod BorderDoom</h1>

      <p>In the pantheon of first-person shooters, I think it’s fair to say that the original <i>Doom</i> ranks somewhat higher than the Borderlands series, but that hasn’t stopped one fan from combining the two: Welcome to BorderDoom.</p>
      <p>As the name suggests, BorderDoom is a mod that combines the aesthetic of iD’s iconic shooter with the loot-shooting mechanics of Gearbox’s sci-fi series. Now, instead of an arsenal of pre-approved weapons, downed enemies will drop guns. Those guns will have randomised stats, so if your boomstick isn’t cutting it in later levels, you can swap it out for something that packs more of a punch.</p>
      <p>BorderDoom’s stats match those found in <i>Borderlands</i>, meaning you’ll now have to pay attention to your magazine size and recoil. To help out, however, the mod also introduces a shield, which should help soak up damage in those tougher fights. And if those still prove difficult, the collection of new weapons - which includes scoped snipers and some kind of vampiric wizard’s staff - should help.</p>
      <p>You can check out the mod for yourself via the <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&amp;t=35978">ZDoom</a> forums (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/doom/mod-borderlands-borderdoom">PCGamesN</a>).</p>
