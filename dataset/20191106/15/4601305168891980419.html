      <p>A company in South Korea will give you a funeral for free, but you have to be alive while it happens.</p>
      <p>Hyowon Healing Center opened in 2012 and promises visitors improved lives through simulated deaths.</p>
      <p>Over 25,000 people have participated in mass “living funeral” services, the business claims.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-livingfunerals/dying-for-a-better-life-south-koreans-fake-their-funerals-for-life-lessons-idUSKBN1XG038">Reuters</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Once you become conscious of death, and experience it, you undertake a new approach to life,” said 75-year-old Cho Jae-hee, who participated in a recent living funeral as part of a “dying well” program offered by her senior welfare center.<br/><br/>Dozens took part in the event, from teenagers to retirees, donning shrouds, taking funeral portraits, penning their last testaments, and lying in a closed coffin for around 10 minutes. <br/><br/>University student Choi Jin-kyu said his time in the coffin helped him realize that too often, he viewed others as competitors.<br/><br/>“When I was in the coffin, I wondered what use that is,” said the 28-year-old, adding that he plans to start his own business after graduation rather than attempting to enter a highly-competitive job market.</blockquote>

      <p>There have been previous rounds of coverage of the “death healing” operation, including <a href="http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=6225">this biomedical review</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/world/what-in-the-world/korea-mock-funeral-coffin.html">New York Times piece</a> from years back -- and there are lots of interesting videos to watch.</p>
