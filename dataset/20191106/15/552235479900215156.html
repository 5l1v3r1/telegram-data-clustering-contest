      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Stewarton</a> man has been found guilty of conning hotels across Scotland by making fake bookings for New Year’s Eve entertainment.</p>
      <p>John Allardice denied being embroiled in the fraudulent scheme, which involved advertising musicians for hire between January 2014 and December 2015.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Sheriff Thomas Ward found Allardice, of Bowes Rigg in Stewarton, guilty of the charge.</p>
      <p>Allardice, 47, had advertised the musicians for hire for New Year’s Eve and the early hours of New Year’s morning and made bookings at multiple four-star venues – all to the tune of £6620.</p>
      <p>Bookings were made with the Stonefield Castle Hotel in Tarbert, Argyll &amp; Bute; The Auchrannie Hotel in Arran; Eight Acres Hotel in Elgin, Moray; and Tinto House Hotel in Symington, South Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Yet Allardice had no ability to carry out these bookings and fulfilled none of them.</p>
      <p>He was convicted of obtaining the funds through fraud and will be sentenced later this month.</p>
