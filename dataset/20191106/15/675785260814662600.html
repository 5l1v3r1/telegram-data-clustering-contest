      <h2>Kim Jong-un has agreed to allow a celebration in the capital Pyongyang next offering tourists a chance to party in the hermit state. A British tour company will be offering packages to visit in March 2020.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:54:17+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Party lovers have been invited to a St Patrick's Day booze-up - in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/north-korea">North Korea</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/north-korea">Kim Jong-un</a> will allow a celebration in capital Pyongyang in March next year after a UK-based tour company were given the green light to offer pub crawls around the city.</p>
      <p>Smiling Grape Adventure Tours have been given permission to mark the occasion in the hermit state.</p>
      <p>The Cambridge-based holiday firm will take a group over to enjoy a tour of the city's best pubs, bars and microbreweries in March 2020.</p>
      <p>And revellers who brave the trip will ever be given tours of some of North Korea's vineyards to sample local wines – making them the first western visitors to do so, reports the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/north-korea-invites-westerners-mark-20822184">Daily Star</a> .</p>

      <p>Matt Ellis, the director of Smiling Grape Adventure Tours, said that despite sanctions, there is a booming beer industry in the country.</p>
      <p>“The drinking culture is big in North Korea,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A shortage of fuel due to the sanctions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs makes it difficult for beer to be shipped around the country, so there are many microbreweries.</p>
      <p>“Microbreweries are everywhere – hotels, restaurants, bowling alleys, karaoke bars and department stores.”</p>
      <p>The tour boss even said the local residents would get into the spirit and mark the day dedicated to the patron saint of Ireland.</p>
      <p>He said: “The North Koreans have many celebrations similar to St Patrick’s Day throughout the year, from the birthdays of the leaders to significant dates in the country’s history.</p>
      <p>“As in Ireland, North Korea uses these holidays to celebrate its cultural identity.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure experiencing an Irish celebration will be quite new to them, but the North Koreans are friendly, kind and inquisitive folks.</p>

      <p>“When you visit you will find the people are warm, welcoming and will ask many questions about your life."</p>
      <p>North Korea’s most famous beer is Taedonggang, which is named for the river that runs through Pyongyang.</p>
      <p>And if it tastes strangely familiar, that’s because the brewery was founded with equipment from the defunct Ushers brewery of Trowbridge, Wiltshire.</p>
      <p>“This is a much more funky, full-bodied and bitter style than the beers of South Korea,” Mr Ellis explained.</p>
      <p>However, North Korea's wines are reportedly not quite as good, with them mostly being used for medicinal purposes.</p>
      <p>“As Western drugs are scarce and medical supplies suffer from chronic shortages, the North Koreans turn to traditional medicines as an alternative," he added.</p>

      <p>“There is the awesome looking snake wine, which has a dead snake floating inside the bottle and is produced to cure short-sightedness and hair loss."</p>
      <p>However, anyone who goes should be careful about any drunken antics that risk offending the country's thin-skinned leader Kim.</p>
      <p>Despite allowing foreign visits, North Korea has on several occasions arrested tourists and sentenced them to hard labour.</p>
      <p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=otto+warmbier+daily+star&amp;oq=otto+warmbier+daily+star&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4255j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">American student Otto Warmbier</a>  was arrested and imprisoned after allegedly attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel.</p>
      <p>He fell into a coma shortly after his sentencing and never regained consciousness, and died within a week of his return to the US in 2017.</p>
      <p>Asked about the wisdom of taking tourists for a boozy trip to the country, Mr Ellis said: “We will be mixing with the locals in the microbreweries, pubs, bars and restaurants.</p>

      <p>“It is well known that alcohol can bring people together as well as helping to bring their guard down.</p>
      <p>“With lower inhibitions from both sides our guests can learn much about their lives in this fascinating and isolated country.”</p>
      <p>The tour, which departs from China, will run from March 15 to March 20, 2020, and is priced at £1,295.</p>
