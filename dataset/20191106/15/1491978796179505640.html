      <h3>GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS GOALS</h3>
      <p>On Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea and Ajax served up an instant Big Cup classic. Eight goals were scored. Two were penalties. Another two were own goals. The penalties were expertly converted, while one of the own goals twanged off someone’s big, startled, confused face in the grand music-hall manner. There was a double sending off for two separate incidents during the same passage of play, one of them a hilariously harsh handball decision. A three-goal comeback was completed in 11 minutes. A late winner got ruled out by VAR, while the side down to nine men were sending their full-backs upfield on the overlap during added time. Also, there was only one set of fans in attendance, so the whole thing was played out in a very surreal, lopsided atmosphere indeed. And they say the group stage is the boring bit.</p>
      <p>Thing is, they used to have a point. We’re only just past the halfway mark in the groups, and already we can file Tuesday night’s 4-4 alongside a 4-3, a 6-2 and <i>that</i> 2-7. Throw in a 6-0 and a 4-3 in Big Vase, plus last week’s preposterous 5-5 draw in the Tin Pot at Anfield, and something very strange is happening in elite football right now. Competent defending hasn’t been this far out of fashion since 1925, when the First Division was producing scorelines such as 11-2, 10-0, 1-7 (twice), 8-3 (twice), 7-3, 6-3 (five times) and 5-3 (four times). That particular carry-on was put down to confusion over the new offside law, although the contemporary half-time diet of cooking brandy, cheroots and industrial-strength speed must also have had some bearing, surely. But there are no such excuses today. We can’t even blame this on VAR, even though we’d like to. What’s going on?</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, we’re on board. And it would seem that Frank Lampard is as well, his post-match quotes suggesting he’s buying into the reckless pleasures of freewheeling fun bigstyle. “I had some mad nights over the years, but this is certainly right up there,” he grinned, feeling all warm and fuzzy. “We need to tighten up for sure, but with that spirit we can go places.” The suggestion implicit that the latter might be more important to him than the former. It’s a brave philosophy which guarantees entertainment, though not necessarily trophies. But then again what’s more important? We’ll be talking about Tuesday evening for years to come, while all traces of Sarriball have already been erased from the memory banks.</p>

      <h3>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h3>
      <p>“It’s total [effing] bullsh!t. We’re not going to London. We’re not going anywhere. We’re playing in Los Angeles. This is our home, and this is where we are planning to be for a long [effing] time” – the LA Chargers owner Dean Spanos, there, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/los-angeles-chargers-london-move-uk-tottenham-hotspur-uk">with some strong effing views</a> on rumours of a groundshare between Tottenham and his NFL team.</p>

      <h3>FIVER LETTERS</h3>
      <p>“I’m sure Mike Riley’s meeting with Premier League managers re VAR will be productive with decisions made on how to move forward (Tuesday’s Bits and Bobs). Chances are these decisions will then be reviewed and overturned a few minutes after everyone’s left by someone at Stockley Park” – Dave Hassall.</p>
      <p>“Just to clarify it was the Old Bill who ‘suggested’ Orient move the game against Brighton U21s. I might have actually bothered to go for the chance of seeing some pwopah nawty Dutch fans having a tear up down the Leyton Technical” – John De la Cruz.</p>
      <p>“He’s been very prolific recently… is Oliver Billenness Noble Francis in disguise?” – Johnny McIntyre (and 1,056 suspicious others).</p>
