      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her coalition partners said on Wednesday they would keep working together after welcoming a report which they said showed how much the government had achieved but also how much it still had to do.</p>

      <p>The review of the government’s legislative achievements started a process that could ultimately end the loveless coalition as it will form the basis of a political assessment by both blocs on whether to carry on in government.</p>
      <p>Merkel agreed to a ‘half-time review’ of the government’s work to help persuade the reluctant Social Democrats (SPD) to join her conservatives in a “grand coalition” in 2018.</p>
      <p>But after sharing power for more than 1-1/2 years, the coalition has struggled to overcome divisions on issues from climate protection to fiscal and migrant policy, and has failed to agree on pension reforms sought by the SPD.</p>
      <p>Despite the differences dogging the coalition, and the work that remains to be done by the government, Merkel said: “This report shows that we are capable of working together.”</p>
      <p>Olaf Scholz, an aspiring SPD leader who is Deputy Chancellor and finance minister, echoed the comments by Merkel, who has said she will not seek a fifth term as chancellor in the next election, due in 2021.</p>
      <p>“I welcome the report which shows what we have achieved... We still have a lot to do,” he said.</p>
      <p>Many SPD members want their party to leave the coalition but support for both the conservative and center-left blocs has slumped since the last election in 2017, making a new election an unwelcome option.</p>
      <p>The future of the coalition depends largely on the SPD. A party conference in December will choose a new leader, after a ballot of members later this month, and is expected to decide whether to stay in or ditch the coalition.</p>
      <p>The leadership contest pits pro-coalition Scholz, running on a ticket with little known politician from the former Communist East, against skeptic Norbert Walter-Borjans.</p>
      <p>Politics professor Andrea Roemmele of the Hertie School of Governance told ARD television the coalition’s arguments undermined its achievements.</p>
      <p>“This coalition gives the impression of a bickering married couple with divorce hanging in the air... at some point voters want to see compromise rather than continual strife,” she said.</p>
