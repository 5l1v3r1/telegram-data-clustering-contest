      <h1>Fox is only cable network to air coverage on ABC News not running Epstein story</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:52:35+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Brest</a></address>
      <p>Fox News has been the only cable news outlet to cover the recent revelation that ABC News didn't run an interview that anchor Amy Robach conducted with one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers years ago.</p>
      <p>Project Veritas released a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-had-it-all-abc-host-claims-network-squashed-epstein-story-three-years-ago-in-leaked-video">video</a> Tuesday of Robach discussing the information she received years earlier from Virginia Roberts Giuffre on a hot mic.</p>
      <p>She voiced her frustration about the network's refusal to run her story and claimed that Buckingham Palace had threatened ABC News after finding out that Prince Andrew was implicated in her reporting. She also expressed her belief that Epstein, the convicted sex offender who was found dead in his jail cell in August, was murdered because of what he knew about "powerful men," despite his death having been ruled a suicide.</p>
      <p>"It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton, we had everything," she stated. "I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. And now it's all coming out, and it's like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it."</p>

      <p>In the 24 hours since <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/spot-on-lawyer-for-epstein-accuser-defends-abc-news-reporter-amy-robach-against-network">Project Veritas released the video</a>, Fox News is the only cable news network to cover the story both on its website and on the air, according to a review of footage using Grabien, a television clipping service. Each of Fox News's shows from 5:00 p.m. through 10:00 p.m. on Tuesday featured coverage of the Robach story except <i>Special Report with Bret Baier</i>.</p>
      <p>Comparatively, CNN, MSNBC, NBC News, and CBS News all failed to cover the Robach story on the air. NBC News is the only one of those outlets to have a story about the incident on its website. However, it was published by the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>A representative for CNN pointed the <i>Washington Examiner </i>to CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter's nightly newsletter when asked about its decision not to report on the story.</p>
      <p>Stelter's Tuesday night newsletter referenced the story, and after writing a summary of the events, he commented, "Tuesday's video clip caused widespread outrage, particularly on the Right, with many [commentators] using it to stoke hatred of the media writ large. Personally, the most troubling part to me is Epstein's usage of high-profile, high-priced lawyers to intimidate news outlets."</p>
      <p>Following the release of the Project Veritas video, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/own-it-fox-news-meteorologist-roasts-abc-news-amy-robach-for-epstein-hot-mic-comments">Robach released a statement</a> claiming that her comments were "caught in a private moment of frustration" and added that her interview with Giuffre "didn't air because we could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC's editorial standards about her allegations."</p>
      <p>Stelter, MSNBC/NBC News, and CBS News did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/abc-news-whistleblower-ashley-bianco-fired-from-cbs-news-for-accessing-the-video">Ashley Bianco</a>, 25, an Emmy-winning producer for <i>CBS This Morning</i>, is the former employee who obtained the footage of Amy Robach. She was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/megyn-kelly-teases-interview-with-abc-news-epstein-whistleblower">interviewed by Megyn Kelly</a>; the interview will be released on Friday afternoon.</p>
