      <h1>‘Climate Changeup’: Yankees Hire Environmental Science Adviser</h1>
      <h2>Allen Hershkowitz hopes to make climate change a regular feature on the sports pages of American media whether fans like it or not.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:26:04+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Penny Starr</a></address>
      <p>And the new environmental science adviser for the New York Yankees hopes to convince people to embrace global warming just like the team they love.</p>
      <p>Yale University’s Climate Connections program <a href="https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/11/the-new-york-yankees-go-to-bat-on-climate-change/">reported</a> on the development:</p>
      <p>To understand the influence of sports, look no further than fans’ passion during last month’s World Series.</p>
      <p>Sports teams have a massive platform, and Allen Hershkowitz believes they can use it to encourage a cultural shift on climate change.</p>
      <p>“Every day, in every city with a newspaper, there’s a sports section,” Hershkowitz said. “There’s not a science section every day, but there is a sports section.</p>
      <p>“I am the only environmental science advisor in professional sports,” Hershkowitz said. “I cannot tell you how influential it is.”</p>
      <p>The article said that “under his guidance” the Yankees signed the United Nations Sports for Climate Action Framework, “a pledge to raise awareness and achieve climate goals.”</p>
      <p>Hershkowitz said the move inspired other sports to follow suit.</p>
      <p>“The NBA, they signed the climate pledge,” Hershkowitz says. “The U.S. Tennis Association signed the pledge once the Yankees did. Wimbledon. Tennis Australia. Minnesota Wild. I mean, I could go on and on.</p>
      <p>“Hershkowitz hopes that as more teams get involved, so too do their fans, and that could be a win for the climate,” the Yale articles said.</p>
      <p>The Green Sports Blog <a href="https://greensportsblog.com/allen-hershkowitz-yankees-enviro-science-advisor-01302019/">praised</a> Hershkowitz’s resume:</p>
      <blockquote>The longtime senior scientist, ex-President of the Green Sports Alliance and Founding Director of Sport and Sustainability International (SandSI) becomes the first person to hold such a title in team sports history. Already a major advance in the Green-Sports movement, the Yankees’ move has the chance to be a true game changer. The Yankees have been at the forefront of the Green-Sports movement since they moved into the new Yankee Stadium in 2009, often with Hershkowitz’ counsel as a consultant.  Sustainability initiatives include:</blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Diverting 85 percent of waste from landfill by recycling and composting, very close to the 90 percent threshold required to claim Zero-Waste status</li>
        <li>Innovating on energy efficiency through the introduction of LED lighting and more</li>
        <li>Measuring, reducing and offsetting the team’s greenhouse gas emissions impacts. The latter includes the distribution of thousands of life-saving, high-efficiency cookstoves to women in Africa</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hershkowitz also a senior scientist at the left-wing Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).</p>
      <p>“The Yankees have always been devoted to supporting the best interests of our community, our fans and our players, and we believe effective eco-friendly initiatives are a key element of our interactions,” Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ principal owner and managing general partner, said in a statement published on the Green Sports Blog website. “We have made significant strides throughout the years, and as such, Yankee Stadium is proud to promote a zero-waste economy, and stand as one of the most successful recycling and composting venues in all of sports…We look forward to even more improvement under Allen’s guidance.”</p>
      <p>The Green Sports blog also warned the Yankees that they have to do two things to make this “progress” real:  “Climate change, not spoken of much by the Yankees to this point, must consistently and clearly be communicated as a prime focus of the Yankees’ environmental efforts, and engage fans — those who attend games and the larger number who follow the team on TV, online and elsewhere — to take positive environmental actions.” </p>
