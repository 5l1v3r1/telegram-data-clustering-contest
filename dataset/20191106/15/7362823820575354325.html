      <p>The founder of Spanx is hopelessly devoted to Olivia Newton-John’s pants.</p>
      <p>Sara Blakely, who founded the shapewear brand in 2000, has revealed herself as the new owner of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/olivia-newton-john-grease-leather-pants-jacket">skintight satin pants</a> Olivia Newton-John famously wore while portraying Sandy Olsson in the 1978 film adaptation of “Grease.”</p>

      <p>The pants, along with the leather jacket that Newton-John wore during the finale of the film, were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-newton-john-grease-outfit-auction">auctioned off</a> on Saturday for $162,500 and $243,200, respectively. The items were among hundreds up for bid from the personal collection of Newton-John, 71, who was selling the pieces in an effort to raise money for her Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Australia.</p>
      <p>Blakely revealed herself as the winning bidder of the pants — as well as one of the film’s Pink Ladies jackets — on “CBS This Morning,” where she claimed she intends to frame the pants in the Spanx headquarters in Atlanta.</p>

      <p>“I have been the biggest fan of Olivia since I was a little girl, since ‘Grease’ came out,” Blakely said, explaining that as soon as a friend told her the pants were up for bid, she knew she had to get them.</p>

      <p>“I’m gonna frame them, and hang then at Spanx, because we have black faux leather leggings … they have become a cult following, and they’re inspired off of Olivia’s pants,” she added, while modeling a pair of the black Spanx leggings herself.</p>
      <p>“I had to own them as the Spanx founder.”</p>
      <p>Blakely added that she had even hired Newton-John, whom she called “the O.G. of black leggings,” to sing at her wedding over a decade ago.</p>
