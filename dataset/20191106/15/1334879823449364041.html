      <p>Do you know your WHY? Here’s mine: ”To inspire, empower, and educate people everywhere so that they can improve their lives and achieve their goals.” Every single thing I do in my career–my motivational speaking work, my writing, my podcast, and every one of my business ventures–revolves around my WHY.</p>
      <p>And this first book on our list will teach you how to find your own WHY, and how to draft your own WHY statement so that you can articulate your purpose to the world effectively and elegantly.</p>

      <p>The author of this book, Cal Newport, told me on my podcast<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/851870/career-books#footnote_plugin_tooltip_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> that being able to sustain your focus for long periods of time is like a super-power. And I believe it. Especially these days–when people are more distracted than ever–it’s crucial to be capable of focusing on your work without succumbing to distraction.</p>
      <p>This book will teach you how to do that, which is why it’s one of the best career books out there.</p>

      <p>Designing Your Life teaches you how to take a design-based approach towards your life in order to live better and optimize the life you lead in every way, and in every area.</p>
      <p>The book was co-authored by Bill Burnett, one of Apple’s original designers; and Dave Evans, a mechanical engineer, and previous VP of Talent for Electronic Arts. Bill and Dave also teach a popular class together at Stanford that teaches students how to leverage design-thinking to customize a personal and professional lifestyle optimized for maximum fulfillment. This career book is based on their Stanford life-design class.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t matter how old you are or how successful you are in your career, there’s <i>always</i> room for improvement. And that’s what this book is all about: becoming a student of your craft.</p>
      <p>Mastery is about <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/10-things-remember-you-want-what-you-love-for-living.html">falling in love with what you do</a>, even when it gets hard. This book taught me about how important it is to choose a career that you’re willing to work on becoming better and better at for the rest of your life… Because if you can find that, as the old saying goes, <i>“you’ll never have to work a day in your life.”</i></p>

      <p>Influencing others is an art. Do it wrong and you come off as sleazy. But if you do it right, you can win the admiration of others and advance your career.</p>
      <p>Learning how to deal with people is one of those skills you won’t learn about in most classrooms. You won’t find it in any business training manuals, either. But if you can learn how to do it, it’ll pay off more than any other specialized skill you can learn–regardless of what industry you’re in. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> is a crucial career book no matter who you are.</p>

      <h3>Which Book Will You Read First?</h3>
      <p>Now that you’ve got this list of career books, there’s only one question left… Which one do you read first? Should you go out and get all of them immediately? Should you read them all at once?</p>
      <p>So many options. So little time. Ultimately, it’s totally your decision what you do with this list and how you apply it to your life and career.</p>
      <p>But if I may, here’s what I would suggest you consider as you get started:</p>
      <p>If you’d prefer to read an entire book, I would highly suggest that you read just ONE book at a time. Sometimes, when we see something new and exciting, we have tendency to want to do/learn/read it all at once… and as we all know, this is nearly impossible to do without stressing ourselves out. So, choose a book. And then commit to reading it from start to finish.</p>
      <p>If you’re in a rush, try <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible audiobooks</a>, or book summary apps such as <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">Blinkist</a> or <a href="https://instaread.co/">InstaRead</a>.</p>
