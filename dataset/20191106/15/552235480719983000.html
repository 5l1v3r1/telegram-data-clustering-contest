      <h1>Builders at Edinburgh Christmas Market spotted balancing on plank at top of railings</h1>
      <h2>A photo of the two workers has sparked further safety fears after a picture emerged of worrying scaffolding at the market.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:43:18+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>A picture of two builders using a plank of wood to balance on a fence while working at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> Christmas Market has fuelled further safety fears about the upcoming event.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/">Daily Record</a> reported on Tuesday that the world famous festive market would not open to the public until it is deemed safe, after a worrying picture was shared of wonky scaffolding balancing on a slope in Princes Street Gardens.</p>
      <p>Now, a photo taken by a passer-by has emerged which shows two workers using a risky method to put up what looks like a decorative panel on the outer fence of the marker.</p>
      <p>In the picture, taken on Friday, two builders can be seen using two planks of wood to balance on top of a spiked fence</p>
      <p>The person who took the photo said he and two of his work colleagues were astounded when they saw what was happening in such a busy street.</p>
      <p>He told the Daily Record that he has been working in contract management for the building trade for more than two decades.</p>

      <p>He said: “We were walking down Princes Street at about 4.15pm on Friday night for a night out when we saw what these clowns were doing.</p>
      <p>“All three of us are well versed on health and safety, so we’ve all seen some things in our time.</p>
      <p>“When builders are doing something as ridiculous as this, they usually do it away from view - so to see it in such plain sight is something I’ve never seen before.</p>
      <p>“We all had a laugh and a joke about it at first, but we then realised how shocking it actually was.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to see the contractor do an investigation on this, as the whole fiasco is shocking.”</p>
      <p>Underbelly, the firm organising the Christmas market have confirmed that they are now looking into the incident.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Underbelly said: "Thank you for drawing this to our attention. This contractor is not working in accordance with our health and safety policies. </p>
      <p>"We are looking into the matter and will take it up with the staff concerned to ensure there is no repeat occurrence.</p>
      <p>"The health and well-being of all our staff and visitors is our primary concern.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, a photo shared by Corstorphine Climate Action showed wonky scaffolding balancing on a slope at Princes Street Gardens.</p>
      <p>And last month, <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-councillors-not-shown-controversial-17166443?_ga=2.88327195.1889116731.1572851403-1111584120.1565592773">Edinburgh Live</a> told how the company behind the Capital’s Christmas market was handed a two-year contract extension, without councillors being shown the design of a controversial steel platform structure yet to receive planning permission.</p>
      <p>It was signed off by the culture convener and his deputy.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh-city-council">Edinburgh City Council</a> have since launched an investigation into whether correct processes were followed.</p>
      <p>The Edinburgh Christmas Market is seen as a huge money spinner for the local economy in the area as thousands descend on the capital city.</p>
