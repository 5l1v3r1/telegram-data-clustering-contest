      <p>Secretary of State for Wales, and British Conservative Party politician Alun Cairns has resigned after his former aide was accused of sabotaging a rape trial. The Welsh secretary reportedly denied knowing about it.</p>
      <blockquote>"This is a very sensitive matter, and in the light of continued speculation, I write to tender my resignation as Secretary of State", Cairns said in a letter to the British PM.</blockquote>

      <p>The statement comes after BBC Wales reported about an email sent to him by Geraint Evans, his special adviser in August 2018 mentioning the matter.</p>
      <blockquote>"I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court", the letter said as quoted by BBC Wales.</blockquote>
      <p>Former aide Ross England was reportedly suspended as a candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan and as an employee, last week after aspects of the court case appeared and the party claimed a "full investigation will be conducted".</p>
      <p>Several politicians immediately called for Cairns to be <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911041077221636-ross-england-conservative-rape-sabotage/">removed as Welsh secretary</a> and withdrawn as a general election candidate in relation to this rape trial.</p>
