      <p>Union Minister Prakash Javdekar is facing growing condemnation after a video of him humiliating and bullying a Times Now journalist went viral on social media. In the viral video, Javdekar, who holds the Ministry of Environment, Forest &amp; Climate Change as well as  Information &amp; Broadcasting Ministry, is seen expressing his displeasure at the manner in which the Times Now journalist Muhammad Wajihullah spoke to him.</p>

      <p>Surrounded by reporters, Javdekar singles out the Times Now journalist as he reacts angrily, “<i>kya naam hai appka</i>? (What’s your name?).” The reporter replies, “Wajihullah.” A visibly angry minister admonishes him by asking, “Wajihullah. <i>Kaun saa paper se ho</i> (Which newspaper are you from)?” “Times Now,’ say the reporter. Javdekar then lectures him by saying ‘<i>to dhang se baat karo na</i> (Talk to me properly).’</p>
      <p>The minister then leaves the venue by warning him that he will speak to Wajiullah’s boss Navika Kumar.</p>

      <p>Navika Kumar has often faced flak for her <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/boycottnetflix-trends-after-times-nows-navika-kumar-called-indias-nancy-grace-and-pm-modi-condemned-for-hostility-towards-minorities-in-hasan-minhajs-video/237543/">alleged biases</a> for the BJP. She was in the news in June this year when American Indian comedian Hasan Minhaj called her India’s own Nancy Grace for her questionable media ethics.</p>
