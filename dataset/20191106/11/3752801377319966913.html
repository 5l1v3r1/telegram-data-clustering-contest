      <p>A Cape Town primary school security guard has been fired after he allegedly sexually abused a pupil, <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-11-05-guard-fired-after-sex-abuse-claims-at-primary-school/">Times Live</a> has reported.</p>
      <p>Western Cape education department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond reportedly said officials had become aware of the alleged incident on October 22.</p>
      <p>A meeting was then scheduled with police and the pupil's parents, according to the publication.</p>
      <p>"The police advised the school that the parents needed to lay a charge. The parents have not yet done so, according to our information," Hammond reportedly said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>She told Times Live that the guard had been employed by the school governing body, but had since been dismissed.</p>
      <p>A social worker is reportedly providing counselling at the school.</p>
      <p>The matter has been referred to SAPS child protection services.</p>
      <p>In October 2017, a security guard was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting up to 87 girls at a Soweto primary school where he worked, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/soweto-school-guard-accused-of-sexual-assault-to-appear-in-court-20171018">News24</a> reported.</p>
      <p>According to the SAPS' 2018/19 crime statistics, there was an increase in sexual offences against children, with 24 387 children falling victim, a 3.8% increase on the previous period.</p>
