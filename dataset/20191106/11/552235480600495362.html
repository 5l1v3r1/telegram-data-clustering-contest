      <h1>Troon boss quits after nightmare start to the season</h1>
      <h2>The 34-year-old had been in charge of the West Premiership outfit since June but announced his departure on twitter this morning.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:00:13+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>Jonathan Baillie has stepped down as Troon manager after a nightmare start to the season.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old had been in charge of the West Premiership outfit since June but announced his departure on twitter this morning.</p>
      <p>His resignation comes on the back of a 1-0 defeat at Rossvale on Saturday which left Troon languishing second bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>The Portland Park side have lost 10 of their 13 league games played so far.</p>
      <p>Baillie admitted he feared the axe in an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/AyrshireJuniors">Ayrshire Juniors</a> reporter Lewis Moynihan after the latest defeat.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "Absolutely there's worry, we are getting beat every week. </p>
      <p>"We've lost three on the spin in the league – I've got to be under pressure as we are down at the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>"If the club feel the need to make a change then that's fine, I'm not going to have any complaints; the results speak for themselves."</p>
      <p>And this morning, posting on his personal twitter page Baillie said: "Monday night I left my position as manager of Troon. Many mitigating factors but ultimately results not been good enough."</p>
