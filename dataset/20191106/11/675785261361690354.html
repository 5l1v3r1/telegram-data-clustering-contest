      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:54:35+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">Liam McInerney</a></address>
      <p>A young man who penned a heartbreaking letter about the death of his dad in Afghanistan as a little boy has revealed how he had begged his father not to go.</p>
      <p>Callum Telford was just ten years old when his soldier dad Matthew Telford was gunned down by a turncoat Afghan policeman in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> in 2009.</p>
      <p>Now, on the tenth anniversary of his dad's death, the Surrey 20-year-old has finally opened up about his final encounter with his hero.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Remembrance Sunday</a> , Callum said: "Before he left to go he was stood at my front door and obviously I was really upset.</p>
      <p>"I turned around and said to him to not go because something bad will happen to him.</p>
      <p>"That is something that has haunted me up until now."</p>

      <p>He also revealed that he hasn't seen his grandparents - Matthew's mum and dad - for almost four years and described how the trauma crippled his family.</p>
      <p>Callum, 20, said: "It is difficult and I feel like when we are together it seems like a raw topic again.</p>
      <p>"I think the last time I saw my grandparents was the last time I saw my brother which was three or four years ago.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"I do still feel part of my dad's family but it is difficult for us to be together.</p>
      <p>"Regardless of what we are doing there is always, for me personally, a negative atmosphere."</p>
      <p>Sergeant Matthew Telford, 37, was gunned down on November 3, 2009, along with four others by a turncoat Afghan policeman - days before the date he had promised his son he would return.</p>
      <p>Callum - his eldest boy - is now in his third and final year of a criminology course.</p>
      <p>He wrote a letter after his dad's death that melted hearts across the UK.</p>

      <p>It read: "I will miss my Dad's sense of humour and I loved his jokes. He was the BFG.</p>
      <p>"My Dad was and still is my hero. He died for his country and I am very proud of him for that.</p>
      <p>"I will miss playing football with him. I will miss him throwing me on to the sofa.</p>
      <p>"He was and still is the best dad in the world. I will miss him very much. R.I.P Daddy."</p>
      <p>Callum still remembers writing the letter and has now recalled the moment he was told the tragic news.</p>
      <p>"I was in my bedroom and I was fast asleep," he said. "My mum came up and said to me that she needed to tell me something.</p>
      <p>"She told me that my dad had died and I thought she was joking - I don't really know why."</p>
      <p>The death of his dad broke up the family and Callum admitted that he has not seen his brother or grandparents in years.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Callum's parents Matthew and Nicola divorced when he was a baby and the soldier moved to Grimsby where he remarried and had a son called Harry, now 14, with new wife Kerry.</p>
      <p>This led to a difficult childhood for Callum who said: "It was only within the last four years of my dad being alive that we started to get a lot closer."</p>
      <p>But his untimely death resulted in a family split and Callum, who lives in Woking, Surrey, with his mum, rarely sees his half brother and grandparents in Grimsby.</p>
      <p>Callum said the army charity Scotty's Little Soldiers has been invaluable in helping him grow up without a dad.</p>

      <p>However, now he is an adult, Callum wishes more help was available.</p>
      <p>"As soon as you hit 19 you don't really get the support you did as a child," he said.</p>
      <p>"They can't keep going forever so I understand why it has a certain cut off but I do think there could be some more.</p>
      <p>"Even if it is not physical help then just a bit more mental support."</p>

      <p>Callum, who works part time in a bar, has been dating his girlfriend Holly Fowler for two years and described her as "the most understanding" person he has ever met.</p>
      <p>He is also a part time DJ and said his love of music was inspired by his father's fondness for German artist Paul van Dyk.</p>
      <p>Callum is still passionate about football - and he misses playing with his dad during those visits in Grimsby.</p>
      <p>But he confessed that changing his team from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> to Arsenal when he was 14 would not have pleased his dad.</p>
      <p>"He would have been absolutely disgusted," Callum, whose dad was a United fan, joked.</p>

      <p>But he added: "I do hope he would be proud of me.</p>
      <p>"I hope he would at least be proud of me for doing something I enjoy doing, that I am passionate about like he was passionate about what he was doing."</p>
      <p>The young man now hopes to rekindle his relationship with his younger brother Harry once he is finished studying at Brighton University.</p>
      <p>"It is something I have dwelled on about my dad not being here that I don't have the relationship with my brother that I could potentially have had if he was still here," Callum said.</p>

      <p>"I know he is always there and whenever I message him he is always there to talk but it would be nice spending some physical time with him."</p>
      <p>Callum will spend the significant anniversary celebrating his dad's life.</p>
      <p>He added: "I will phone my brother and phone my grandparents and have an extensive chat with them.</p>
      <p>"I will have a meal here and go out with my mum and my girlfriend."</p>

      <p>Callum said he never considered joining the armed forces but said his dad "wouldn't have changed anything" in his 20 year career.</p>
      <p>"As I got older I do completely comprehend that he's done a job for his whole life that he has enjoyed doing.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a job it was a career and he absolutely loved it.</p>
      <p>"He wouldn't have changed it for the world."</p>
