      <p>A Malaysian man who killed a pregnant cat by putting it into a laundrette dryer has been sentenced to 34 months in jail, official media reported, in a case that sparked outrage.</p>
      <p>K. Ganesh was handed the prison term Tuesday after being found guilty of breaking animal protection laws at the self-service laundry outside Kuala Lumpur in September last year, official news agency Bernama reported.</p>
      <p>He will remain free on bail for now as he plans to appeal.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old was the second man to be sentenced over the killing after a taxi driver was jailed for two years for the crime in January.</p>
      <p>Malaysians reacted with fury when CCTV footage went viral showing the cat being stuffed into the dryer late at night.</p>
      <p>Two men then inserted tokens into the machine to set it running and left. A female customer later found the animal’s carcass and the matter was reported to the police.</p>
      <p>Sentencing Ganesh, Judge Rasyihah Ghazali said: “I hope this sentence will serve as a lesson to the accused and the public to not be cruel to animals.”</p>
      <p>He was also fined 40,000 ringgit ($9,700), Bernama reported late Tuesday. AFP could not immediately contact Ganesh’s lawyers.</p>
      <p>A third person was earlier detained over the killing but prosecutors dropped the case.</p>
