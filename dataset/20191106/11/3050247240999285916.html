      <h1>Bakkt Set to Smash Bitcoin Trading Volume Record in November</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:11:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) futures trading on the Intercontinental Exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt">Bakkt</a> platform is seeing a considerable rise in average daily volume so far this month compared to September and most of October.</p>
      <p>Volumes yesterday, Nov. 5, hit close to their all-time-high — with 1061 traded contracts worth $10 million, a 96% increase over the previous day.</p>
      <p>According to tracking data <a href="https://twitter.com/BakktBot/status/1182201604990230530">compiled</a> by Twitter account Bakkt Volume Bot (@BakktBot) — which is not affiliated with Bakkt but rather with a Dutch journalist and crypto author Gert-Jan Lasterie — the platform had posted its all-time-high for traded contracts on Oct. 25. </p>
      <h3>November on course to smash October volumes</h3>
      <p>At the current pace, Bakkt should trade over $200 million in BTC futures contracts in November. </p>
      <p>Bakkt Volume Bot’s data reveals that as of late October, Bitcoin futures trading has been significantly and consistently higher than during the first month of the platform’s launch.</p>

      <p>When compared to data on the Bitcoin spot markets, this <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-hits-new-all-time-high-with-over-450-bitcoin-futures-contracts-traded">strong uptick</a> in Bakkt volume appears to correspond to a period of volatility kicking off — with Bitcoin falling below $7,500 and rapidly soaring to over $10,400 in late October, before settling closer to the $9,300 range in recent days.</p>
      <h3>Catch-up</h3>
      <p>Notwithstanding the more robust volume posted on Bakkt, volumes are still a considerable way off from the almost <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance_futures">$970 million</a> in daily traded volume currently on the Binance Futures platform.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, Bakkt’s much-anticipated contracts — the first of their kind to be physically settled in Bitcoin — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkts-much-anticipated-bitcoin-futures-trading-platform-goes-live">went live</a> on Sept. 22.</p>
      <p>The platform’s underwhelming volumes in its first week were immediately unfavorably <a href="https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1175567382032592896">compared</a> to the fiat-settled BTC futures on CME, which first launched back in December 2017.</p>
