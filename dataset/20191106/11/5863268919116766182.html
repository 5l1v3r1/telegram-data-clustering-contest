      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday expressed strong anger over postgraduate training doctors – who have been protesting against Medical Teaching Institutions (MTI) Act and possible privatisation of the hospitals – for suspending treatment to patients and not appearing in the hearing today despite of court’s orders.</p>
      <p>Justice Jawad Hassan presided over hearing of a petition against protesting doctors and remarked: “I will see which doctor refuses treatment to patients […] we will direct crackdown against protesting doctors today.”</p>
      <p>“There is no concept of doctors going on strike all over the world […] who gives license to these doctors?” the court asked.</p>
      <p>Health department officials told the court that the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) issues license to the medical practitioners.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the court has again summoned concerned authorities and representatives of protesting doctors in the next hearing.</p>
