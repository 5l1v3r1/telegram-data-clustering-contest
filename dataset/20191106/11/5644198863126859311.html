      <p>HONG KONG: A knife-wielding man on Wednesday (Nov 6) attacked a pro-Beijing lawmaker who has taken a tough stand against <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-protests-critical-condition-police-update-12060710">anti-government protests in Hong Kong</a>, police said, as more demonstrations were planned for the Asian financial hub.</p>
      <p>Legislator Junius Ho, his assistant and the alleged attacker were taken to hospital with unspecified injuries following the assault, police said.</p>

      <p>Video posted online showed the moment the attack took place.</p>
      <p>A man holding a bouquet of flowers approached Junius Ho on Wednesday morning as the politician was campaigning with party members in his constituency of Tuen Mun, a town on the outskirts of Hong Kong near the border with China.</p>
      <p>The man gave Ho the flowers, asked to take a picture and then pulled a knife from his bag before striking his victim in the chest.</p>
      <p>Ho and his aides quickly subdued the man who could be heard shouting in Cantonese: "Junius Ho, you scum!"</p>
      <p>A police source, who declined to be named, told AFP that Ho received a stab wound to the left side of his chest and the attacker was arrested.</p>
      <p>Ho, 57, was conscious when he got into the ambulance.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement posted online that he had suffered a knife wound to the upper left part of his chest, but said his life was not at risk. Two of his colleagues were also hurt, he said.</p>
      <p>The attacker's motive was unknown but Ho gained notoriety among anti-government protesters in July when he was filmed laughing and shaking hands with suspected triad gang members who assaulted peaceful demonstrators.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The attack on Ho comes amid more than five months of sometimes violent political unrest in the former British colony-turned semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Alongside Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam and police chief Stephen Lo, Ho has become one of the most loathed establishment figures among protesters.</p>
      <p>He has long been one of the most stridently pro-Beijing politicians in the city.</p>
      <p>But he shot to notoriety on Jul 21 after he was filmed shaking hands with a group of men in the town of Yuen Long who went on to beat protesters with sticks and poles, hospitalising 40 people.</p>
      <p>He has delivered multiple speeches supporting Hong Kong's police force and echoing Beijing's condemnations of protesters, often using incendiary language.</p>
      <p>Last month he accused a prominent opposition lawmaker of "eating foreign sausage" because she is married to a British journalist.</p>
      <p>After the Yuen Long attack, Ho's office was ransacked by protesters and the graves of his parents were also vandalised.</p>
      <p>Discussion of the incident went viral in mainland China, where the Internet is heavily censored.</p>
      <p>Four hashtags related to the stabbing racked up 550 million views and more than 71,000 posts on Chinese social media by mid-afternoon.</p>
      <p>The state-run People's Daily and Global Times newspapers also linked to a video of the stabbing on Twitter - a platform they have embraced to reach international audiences but is banned inside China.</p>
      <p>Lam strongly condemned the attack when she met reporters in Beijing.</p>

      <p>Further protests were planned on Wednesday at some of Hong Kong's universities, activists said. Police fired water cannon to disperse protesters at a Guy Fawkes-themed march on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>China's Communist Party said on Tuesday it would not tolerate any "separatist behaviour" in Hong Kong, after some of the protesters called for independence.</p>
      <p>What started as a protest against a proposed China extradition Bill has widened into the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping's rule since he came to power in 2012.</p>
      <p>Protesters are demanding an end to perceived Chinese meddling in the territory's affairs, as well as universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, among other demands.</p>
      <p>Tensions have risen again in recent days after a teenager was left in a coma when he fell one storey inside a car park where police were firing tear gas at projectile-throwing protesters on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Beijing denies interfering and blames foreign governments for fuelling the unrest.</p>
      <p>Xi met Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday in Shanghai, vouching support for her administration.</p>
      <p>Following the meeting, Lam denied rumours that the government was considering an amnesty for protesters charged with offences.</p>
