      <p>The Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after three ducks were found in Wishaw.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s animal welfare charity was alerted to two Indian runner ducks by a motorist on November 4.</p>
      <p>A further single muscovy duck was found the next day just a few streets away from where the first two ducks were picked up.</p>
      <p>Scottish SPCA animal rescue officer Stephanie Kirk said: “The Indian runner ducks were found on Campbell Street which is a busy road.</p>

      <p>“Luckily the birds were uninjured and we are grateful to the member of the public for reporting this as they could have been hit by a car.</p>
      <p>“We were then alerted to a muscovy duck in a nearby area.</p>
      <p>“All three of the ducks found are domesticated breeds, so we feel it’s likely they’ve come from the same place.</p>
      <p>“If anyone has any information, we would urge them to call our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.”</p>
