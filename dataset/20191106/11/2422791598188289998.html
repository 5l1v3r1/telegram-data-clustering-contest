      <h1>Supreme Court set to hear Uber case with implications for gig economy</h1>

      <p>OTTAWA -- The Supreme Court of Canada is set to start to hear a case today brought by Uber with potentially significant implications for the gig economy.</p>
      <p>The company has challenged an Ontario Court of Appeal decision that found the company's contract clause that requires arbitration, rather than allowing class-action lawsuits, was invalid and unconscionable.</p>
      <p>The lower court ruling came about after David Heller, a driver for UberEats, tried to launch a class-action lawsuit to force the company to recognize drivers as employees and provide them a minimum wage, vacation pay, and other protections in the Employment Standards Act.</p>
      <p>Uber successfully had the proposed class action stayed because of a clause in the contract that requires all disputes go through mediation in the Netherlands. The process costs US$14,500, while as a driver Heller was making about $20,800 to $31,200 a year before taxes and expenses.</p>
      <p>Ontario's highest court ruled in November last year that the clause amounts to illegally outsourcing an employment standard.</p>
      <p>The case comes amid wider scrutiny about what obligations technology firms have to the people who find work through their platforms, and whether they are employees.</p>
      <p>California passed a law in September that codified most contract workers including through tech platforms as employees. Uber, Lyft and DoorDrash have pledged US$90 million to overturn the law in a ballot measure.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Ontario Labour Relations Board is looking into whether people who deliver for Foodora are employees as part of a challenge on a union vote among some workers.</p>
      <p>Heller's proposed class action, seeking $400 million, has sought to launch it on behalf on Ontario Uber drivers who have worked for the company since 2012.</p>
      <p>Uber, in its appeal to the Supreme Court, claims that the agreements entered into with drivers are licensing agreements, not employment agreements, and that the company had to establish a uniform, global dispute resolution system because of the enormous number of drivers on the platform.</p>
