        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): WhatsApp is witnessing a drop in downloads after it was revealed that foreign cyber-criminals were allegedly spying on Indian journalists and activists via the instant messaging app.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the last week, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911041077219305-indian-government-finds-gaps-in-whatsapps-reply-on-spyware-issue/">WhatsApp</a> downloads saw a staggering 80 per cent decline in India – the largest market for the Facebook-owned messaging app, with over 400 million users.</p>
      <p>According to mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower, WhatsApp downloads in the country mid-October stood firm at 8.6 million, however, between 26 October and 3 November, the app downloads dived to just 1.8 million, media <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/%20tech/news-analysis/pegasus-%20spyware-whatsapp-downloads-in-%20india-are-down-by-80-percent-%207607941.html">reported</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>At a time when data privacy has become a priority to tech-savvy Indians, their quitting WhatsApp citing security concerns and moving to other options does not come as a surprise.</p>
      <p>Reaping the benefits of WhatsApp's ill-fate in India, end-to-end encrypted apps -- Telegram and Signal witnessed an increase in downloads by 63 per cent and 10 per cent respectively across the country.</p>
      <p>While the user-base of the US-based "Signal" messenger increased to 9,600 users from 5,900 users, the German "Telegram" app grew its user base to 920,000, up from the previous 840,000 users in India.</p>
      <p>Earlier last week, WhatsApp <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077189928-indian-govt-seeks-clarification-from-whatsapp-on-latest-data-breach---report/">confirmed</a> that the Israeli cyber Intelligence Company NSO Group was snooping on Indian activists and journalists via spyware called "Pegasus" that can compromise a device and get access to all of a target's data.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, the Facebook-owned messaging app claimed it informed the Indian authorities about the vulnerability in May 2019.</p>
      <p>However, a government official recently said India's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) could not fathom the magnitude of the situation due to the advisory being full of 'technical jargon'.</p>
      <p>Although WhatsApp has end-to-end encryption, the actual contents of the shared messages are not checked.</p>
      <p>"Pegasus" spyware is believed to have entered the messaging app via infected links shared as chats on the app.</p>
