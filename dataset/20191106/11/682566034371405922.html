      <p>Cape Town -<b> Serena Williams </b>needs to play in more tournaments in preparation for the Grand Slams, according to former WTA star<b> Daniela Hantuchova</b>.</p>
      <p>The 2019 campaign has been another case of so close, but yet so far for Williams in terms of equalling Margaret Court's all-time major record of 24.</p>
      <p>The 23-time Grand Slam winner reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals again, but came up short against Simona Halep at SW19 and Bianca Andreescu at Flushing Meadows.</p>
      <p>Williams has played a reduced schedule since returning to action following the birth of her daughter, but Hantuchova feels she should add a few more events to her calendar.</p>
      <p>"I do hope it happens for her, as a reward for the champion she is," she told the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/sports/tennis/ashleigh-barty-wta-finals.html">New York Times</a></i>.</p>
      <p>"But I do believe she should play a few extra tournaments to be able to handle those finals better and so things can come automatically in the big moments."</p>
