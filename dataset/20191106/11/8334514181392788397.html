      <p>PADUA, Italy (Reuters) - Italian finance police searched offices of several companies working for state-controlled shipbuilder Fincantieri, as part of an investigation into suspected corruption, fraud and worker exploitation, the prosecutor’s office in Venice said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor added in a statement that 34 people were under investigation for alleged “systematic exploitation” of foreign workers - mainly from Bangladesh and Albania - in shipyards in the port city of Marghera, close to Venice, working on orders for Fincantieri.</p>
      <p>The searches involved 19 different companies in seven different Italian regions and 12 Fincantieri managers, the statement said, without specifying whether the executives were under investigation.</p>
      <p>Fincantieri was not immediately available for comment.</p>
