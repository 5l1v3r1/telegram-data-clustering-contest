      <p><b>Advance Base</b> (aka Owen Ashworth, who used to go by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone) has been covering <b>Lucinda Williams</b>‘ 1992 song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2f8DCPCdTE">“Sweet Old World”</a> on tour this year, and following requests from fans for Owen to record it, he did just that. His version is still recognizable as “Sweet Old World,” but he really turns it into something that sounds like it could’ve been an Advance Base original. Owen says:</p>
      <blockquote>“Sweet Old World” deals with the grief &amp; confusion that follows the suicide of a loved one. The lyrics are tender &amp; devastating, like many of Lucinda Williams’ best, but the song is ultimately an affirmation of every good &amp; beautiful thing that makes life worth living. Advance Base’s cover replaces the original’s traditional country rock instrumentation with an upbeat electronic arrangement of analog synthesizers, Optigans &amp; drum machines.<br/><br/>I started covering “Sweet Old World” during the Advance Base summer 2019 tour, &amp; this recording was made at the request of a handful of show attendees in the US, Canada &amp; UK who were kind enough to email me or tell me in person how much the cover meant to them. This single is for them.</blockquote>
