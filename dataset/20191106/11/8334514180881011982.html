      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Wednesday that France would set immigrant quotas for professionals, marking a precedent with a measure long sought by the country’s right-wing parties.</p>
      <p>Better regulation and curbing of immigration is a topic that President Emmanuel Macron has said would be at the heart of the next presidential election in 2022.</p>
      <p>“Our will is to make choices in how we welcome (the migrants): set quantitative goals or quotas, both expressions suit me, for professional immigration”, Philippe told a news conference.</p>
