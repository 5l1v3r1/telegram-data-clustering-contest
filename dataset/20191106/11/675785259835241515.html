      <p>An attempted murderer who tried to kill his ex and injected heroin into his baby daughter's mouth has died while serving his prison sentence.</p>
      <p>Roger Weir, 52, attacked the victim with a meat cleaver, and squirted the Class A drug into the baby's mouth to "get at" her.</p>
      <p>He was behind bars at HMP Berwyn in Wrexham when he was admitted to the town’s Maelor hospital on October 16 with severe abdominal pains.</p>
      <p>He died in the intensive therapy unit 12 days later.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination was carried out by Home Office pathologist Dr Brian Rodgers who gave the provisional cause of death as cancer of the liver.</p>
      <p>At a brief hearing at Ruthin John Gittins, senior coroner for North Wales East and Central, said it was mandatory to hold an inquest as Weir was in custody at the time.</p>

      <p>The inquest was adjourned to a date to be fixed.</p>
      <p>Weir, of Poole in Dorset, was jailed for 18 years at Winchester Crown Court in 2012 after admitting attempting to murder his ex-girlfriend Gillian Blackmore.</p>
      <p>The court heard how he went to her flat in Eastleigh on May 7, 2012, armed with a specially adapted flare gun capable of firing bullets.</p>
      <p>He told her “I want you dead” before firing the gun at her, then beat her with a baton and attacked her with a meat cleaver.</p>
      <p>Miss Blackmore managed to escape and raise the alarm, and police found her covered in blood.</p>

      <p>Weir told police he was angry that she had a new partner, a police community support officer.</p>
      <p>The court also heard how he squirted heroin into the mouth of his 20-month-old daughter to “get at” Miss Blackmore.</p>
      <p>He admitted administering a noxious substance but the prosecution accepted he had not wanted to murder the toddler, having acted “in the heat of the moment”.</p>
      <p>The baby spat most of the heroin out and was not harmed.</p>
      <p>A Prison Service spokesman said: “HMP Berwyn prisoner Roger Weir died in hospital.</p>
      <p>“As with all deaths in custody there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.”</p>
