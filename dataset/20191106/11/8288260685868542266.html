      <p>Britain's worst Elvis Presley impersonator has been left 'All Shook Up' after being banned from a look-a-like contest - for being 'too rubbish.'</p>
      <p>Organisers of the annual King's Crown Elvis tribute contest told stunned Simon Goldsmith he could not compete because they did not want him 'laughed off stage.'</p>
      <p>Simon, 46, works as a postman by day and raises money for charity at night by turning into the King of Rock 'n' Roll and belting out hits wearing a white, sequin clad suit.</p>
      <p>And while he admits he's a 'bit low budget' and probably the 'eighth best Elvis tribute' in his home village, he says he always puts on a good show.</p>
      <p>Contest organisers had told Simon he could not take part in last month's event because they 'did not want to embarrass anyone' and claimed his act was 'too comical.'</p>
      <p>Simon, who admits he is probably Britain's worst Elvis tribute, said: "I might look a bit rubbish, but I can sing and put on a really good show!</p>
      <p>"I don't look anything like Elvis, but I can sing like him pretty well.</p>
      <p>"I just want to do something different and to be fun. You see a lot of Elvis tributes who just go through all his tracks but I do something different.</p>
      <p>"People really enjoy what I do and if it makes people happy then that's a job well done!</p>
      <p>"I applied for the competition in February but I was rather suspicious of it because these competitions always sets alarm bells ringing.</p>
      <p>"You either get one for a variety of different acts or you got one where it's a bunch of old friends performing straight and it turned out to be the latter.</p>
      <p>"I sent the organiser some pictures and a video of me but I think he did a bit of digging because he asked for some other ones that weren't comical.</p>
      <p>"I just said we'd leave it there but when I saw the quality of some of them that got in I thought I could have done that!"</p>

      <p>As Harry Isaac Presley, Simon covers modern songs including Britney and does a varied amount of Elvis looks- including Zombie Elvis.</p>
      <p>Simon, from Suffolk, explained: "I did it as a one off on New Year's Eve in 2005 so that was my first public outing. It was just for fun.</p>
      <p>"Then it all changed when my dad passed away in a hospice in 2009.</p>
      <p>"There was a world record attempt for the longest ever Elvis marathon and the world record then was 42 hours. I tried to beat it in 2010 but I only got to 35 hours before I had to stop.</p>

      <p>"That's when I got a bit of press coverage and it just grown from there. I do a lot of charity events and I've done a marathon dressed as Elvis.</p>
      <p>"I think it's great and we've made lots of money over the years.</p>
      <p>"My act is a spoof Elvis tribute act. It's more of an Elvis tribute tribute!</p>
      <p>"It's quite slapstick and I don't take myself too seriously and I do alternative songs. I cover songs that weren't even around in his era like Britney Spears but I sing it in his style."</p>

      <p>Simon had planned to donate the £1,000 prize money from the Ipswich-held competition to St Elizabeth Hospice in memory of his late-dad.</p>
      <p>But after his application was rebuffed, he checked out of 'Heartbreak Hotel' and decided to fund raise himself and raised over £2,600 in just three days.</p>
      <p>He added: "I did some gigs and concerts and I couldn't believe how much money was raised. My target was £1,000 but in the end it was over £2,000."</p>
      <p>Andy Sexton, the organiser of the King's Crown Elvis tribute act competition, said he didn't accept Simon's application because he was "too comical."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "Our Elvis competition is not a comedy show.</p>
      <p>"It's all getting a bit silly now. Every Elvis tribute act in the competition are serious, they don't clown about and there's a certain standard that they all have to meet.</p>
      <p>"Anyone could enter it otherwise, I could do Elvis a little and enter myself but these guys are professionals.</p>

      <p>"If you were going into a Madonna competition and you do a bit of comedy and then the ten other Madonna's blow you out of the water you would feel a bit silly.</p>
      <p>"I'm the organiser and I didn't pick him it's as simple as that, if he's refused, he's refused. I choose between 10 to 12 to enter and they have to be the best.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want people laughing at him."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Although he admires Simon's charitable work, Andy claims he just wasn't right for the competition because Elvis "doesn't dress up as a zombie."</p>
      <p>He continued: "He does a lot of charity work and I'm not going to take that away from him. I take my hat off to him for all the money he has raised for charity, he gets my total respect for that.</p>

      <p>"My competition is small fry compared to some other competitions. He's making himself look silly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I turned four others away exactly the same, I'm never nasty. I would tell them that they haven't been accepted this year but that I would consider them for the next year.</p>
      <p>"Elvis didn't dress up as a zombie or anything like that, it just wasn't his humour. He would have got laughed off stage and I didn't want that for him, I'm not a cruel guy.</p>
      <p>"This is a serious competition and people pay money to get into it and watch it."</p>
