        <i>Former England international denies assaulting ex-Barnsley manager in stadium tunnel</i>
      </p>
      <p>Joey Barton, the manager of Fleetwood Town football club, will go on trial next year accused of assaulting the former Barnsley manager Daniel Stendel during an incident following a match.</p>
      <p>Barton, 37, is alleged to have pushed Stendel at Barnsleyâ€™s Oakwell stadium on 13 April, leaving him with a damaged tooth.</p>
      <p>The former England international pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when he appeared at Sheffield crown court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A provisional trial date was fixed for 1 June 2020.</p>
      <p>Barton, of Widnes, Cheshire, stood in the dock, flanked by a security officer, for the 15-minute appearance.</p>
      <p>He spoke to confirm his name and date of birth, that he was a UK national, and that he understood various matters outlined by the judge. He entered a not guilty plea to the single charge.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and Burnley midfielder was charged following an incident in the tunnel after the League One match, which ended in a 4-2 victory for the home team.</p>
      <p>Barton was granted unconditional bail by Judge Jeremy Richardson.</p>
