      <p><b>Kendra Malia</b> of NYC witch house band <b>White Ring</b> has passed away. The band revealed the sad news in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitering999/posts/10156730448737361">post</a> on their Facebook, which reads, “On October 31st 2019 Kendra Malia left us, I really don’t know what else to say at the moment except I love you Kendra. KENDRA FOREVER.”</p>
      <p>White Ring emerged in the early 2010s with an EP, a split with oOoOO, and a few other singles, before going on a seven-year hiatus and re-emerging in 2018 with their first full-length album, <i>Gate of Grief</i>. Just last month, they put out the two-song <i>Slow Burned</i> 7″, featuring the song “Shaken to Sleep” which got a video release earlier this week (watch below). They had just gone on a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitering999/photos/a.439136247360/10156580652652361/?type=1&amp;theater">fall Europe tour</a> before Kendra’s sudden passing. In addition to White Ring, Kendra also sang guest vocals on “Slaves” off King Dude’s 2011 album <i>Tonight’s Special Death</i>.</p>
      <p>Rest in peace, Kendra. You’ll be missed.</p>
