      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/QuentinTarantino?CMP=ILC-refresh">Quentin Tarantino</a> may have been busy releasing a new film in 2019, but that hasn’t stopped him from going to the cinema.</p>
      <p>Every year, the director gets very vocal about the films he has been enjoying over the past 12 months, and – despite it being only November – he has named his favourite movie of the year.</p>
      <p>Tarantino was a big fan of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/crawl-film-trailer-release-date-reactions-alligator-horror-film-kaya-scodelario-a8996801.html"><i>Crawl</i></a>, the Sam Raimi-produced alligator thriller released this summer.</p>
      <p>The film follows a young woman (played by Kaya Scodelario) who, while trying to save her father (Barry Pepper) during a Category Five hurricane in Florida, finds herself trapped in a flooding house with nothing for company but alligators.</p>
      <p>Tarantino named the film as his favourite to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/dark-waters-oscar-jokers-tarantino-scprsese-ray-romano-1202774166/"><i>Deadline</i></a> journalist Pete Hammond. </p>
      <p>“Tarantino told me that, as incredible as he says it might sound, he thinks his favourite film so far this year just might be – wait for it – <i>Crawl</i>,” he wrote. “That’s right, the alligators-in-a-hurricane movie directed by Alexandre Aja that Paramount released a couple of weeks before QT’s movie came out in July.”</p>
      <p>It is nice to know that, despite being busy with the press tour for his own film, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood"><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i></a>, Tarantino found time to seek out the competition.</p>
      <p>Sony is pushing Tarantino’s film for Best Picture, Best director and Best Original Screenplay at next year’s Oscars. Campaigns have also been launched for its lead stars, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/leonardo-dicaprio-best-films-inception-martin-scorsese-christopher-nolan-shutter-island-list-a8775786.html">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>, in the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories, respectively.</p>
