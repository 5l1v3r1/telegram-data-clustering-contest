      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> has admitted he felt “incredibly angry” that his long-time collaborator <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ant-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> did not confide in him about his addiction struggles from the beginning.</p>
      <p>McPartlin took a break from his television commitments due to an addiction to subscription painkillers and his <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/ant-mcpartlin-drink-driving-guilty-plea-wimbledon-dec-presenter-a8307021.html">conviction for drink-driving in 2018.</a></p>
      <p>His departure meant that Donnelly was left to present <i>Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway</i> alone, while <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/holly-willoughby-im-a-celebrity-co-host-ant-mcpartlin-dec-donnelly-itv-a8512451.html">Holly Willoughby stepped in</a> to co-host the most recent series of <i>I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!</i></p>
      <p>This year, the iconic presenting duo are reuniting for the next series of<i> I’m a Celebrity</i> and a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/ant-mcpartlin-additction-channel-5-documentary-air-date-a8843501.html">new documentary entitled <i>Ant and Dec's DNA Journey.</i></a></p>
      <p>Speaking at the London press screening of the documentary, Donnelly said he thought he had lost his best friend.</p>
      <p>“It has been a tough couple of years and it has tested the bond we have shared since we were 13 years old,” he said. “I was incredibly angry at the start, so angry…</p>
      <p>“I was disappointed that he didn't ever come to me and say, 'I am struggling, I need you,' because that is what I would do if the shoe was on the other foot.</p>
      <p>“And he never came to me and that hurt me a lot.”</p>
      <p>When asked if he believed he may have lost his friendship with McPartlin, Donnelly replied: “Yes. There was a point where I thought that that was it. </p>
      <p>“There were times where I wasn't sure it was going to survive. Times where you didn’t know it needed to survive or you wanted it to survive.”</p>
      <p><i>Ant &amp; Dec's DNA Journey</i> airs on Sunday 10 and Monday 11 November on ITV. </p>
      <p><i>I'm a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! </i>begins on ITV on 17 November.</p>
