      <p>JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- Police say a pedestrian was killed when she was struck by a stolen vehicle in Queens Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The crash happened at about 9:15 p.m. on Archer Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard in Jamaica.</p>
      <p>According to police, the driver traveling in a stolen Hyundai Sonata jumped a curb and hit the woman, who was pinned under the vehicle.</p>
      <p>A responding NYPD sergeant injured his shoulder lifting the front of the vehicle off the woman. His injury was minor, but the victim died at the hospital.</p>
      <p>The driver apparently ran away from the scene.</p>
      <p>Police had at first detained a <a href="https://abc7ny.com/woman-fatally-struck-when-stolen-car-jumps-curb-in-queens/5674999/">38-year-old neighborhood man</a>, but later determined he was not involved in the crash.</p>
      <p>Officials are now examining surveillance cameras in the area to try to find video of the person behind the wheel.</p>
