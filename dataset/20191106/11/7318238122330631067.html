      <p>Foreign tourists were among eight people injured in a stabbing attack in the Jordanian city of Jerash, the country's public security directorate has said.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policejo/photos/a.584626844936779/2543441995721911/?type=1&amp;theater">statement</a>, the directorate said four Jordanians, three Mexicans and one Swiss national were among those injured.</p>
      <p>In a statement to Euronews, the Swiss Federal Department for Foreign Affairs said they were aware of the knife attack and their representation in Amman is assisting the Swiss victim.</p>
      <p>Early reports had indicated that the victims were Spanish citizens, but Spain's foreign minister said this was not the case.</p>
      <p>Footage captured after the attack was later shared across social media, and showed one person lying on blood-soaked ground as another appeared to use a cloth to place pressure on a wound to the back.</p>
      <p>Another person, also covered in blood, was seen sitting on a nearby wall.</p>
      <p>Natalie, who witnessed the scene, said she and her tour group of American citizens were close to the Roman city’s hippodrome before a guide told them there had been an "accident".</p>
      <p>"We came out [and] we saw the crowd and blood. I thought it was a fight. There wasn’t even police tape and people weren’t treated yet."</p>

      <p>Speaking to Euronews, Natalie said, "you could have walked through the blood ... [later] police were running around."</p>
      <p>Natalie added she and her husband were "shook" when they later saw police standing near a machete on the ground, but it is not known if this was connected to the stabbings.</p>
      <p>In a thread on Twitter, another <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacySeller">witness</a> described the "shock" he felt.</p>
      <p>He added that the attacker appeared to be dressed in "black, militant gear, including head covering".</p>

      <p>Speaking to Reuters, bus driver and eyewitness Ali El Agrabawi said he was stabbed after leaning towards a man carrying a knife when the group was stopped at a cafeteria.</p>
      <p>"He passed in front of me and I leaned towards him. I slipped, and he stabbed me. I then backed away, moving towards the policeman. He gave the policeman a slight stab. I tried to attack him from behind. I pushed him to the ground. Afterwards, all the policemen came and took him."</p>
      <p>In an earlier statement to Facebook, the security directorate said one person had been arrested after the attack and that investigations had since been launched.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson added that all the injured are still receiving treatment and their condition is all "moderate", except for a Jordanian security official and one Mexican tourist, who were described as "critical".</p>

      <p>Mexico's Foreign Affairs secretary has tweeted that the three Mexican tourists injured were on a guided tour of the city of Jerash.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a hospital near Jerash, the Jordanian Minister of Health Saed Jaber said that the situation has been controlled, and both cases are stable."</p>
      <p>"Two cases were transferred by helicopter to King Hussein Medical City after contacting them, because they need specific, or possible, rearrangement."</p>

      <p>The British Embassy is in contact with local authorities and urgently seeking information for tourists following the incident.</p>
      <p>Jerash, a city situated north of the Jordanian capital Amman, is an area popular with tourists due to the ancient Roman settlement located on the outskirts.</p>
