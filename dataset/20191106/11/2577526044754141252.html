      <h1>New Red Dead Redemption 2 Mods Let You Skip its Opening Chapters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:30:25+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>I’ve heard mixed things about <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> since its console release last year, and now that the game has arrived on PC, I can’t say its modding community is doing my impression of it any favours.</p>
      <p>The first few hours of Rockstar’s cowboy epic take place in and around a unique camp in which you’re introduced to its main characters and taught to navigate its world, before eventually moving on to a new camp at the end of the first chapter. If you’re a new player, that’s great news, as it sounds like a good way to gear up for the rest of your adventure. But if you learned the perfect way to skin a rabbit the first time around, I can imagine it gets a little tedious.</p>
      <p>Enter the burgeoning community of Red Dead Redemption modders. Not content with <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/05/the-first-red-dead-redemption-2-pc-mods-have-already-arrived">turning Arthur Morgan into the Joker</a>, they’ve now started sharing save files to help you skip swathes of the early game. Popular modding site <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2?tab=new+this+week">Nexusmods</a> currently hosts seven mods, two of which will skip you to the end of the intro, and a third that’ll take you all the way to the beginning of chapter 3.</p>
      <p>Personally, a subsection of the community dedicated to helping you skip through massive chunks of a story-driven game doesn’t sound like the greatest advert ever, but I’ll admit that repeatedly playing through tutorials you’ve already done doesn’t sound much fun either.</p>
