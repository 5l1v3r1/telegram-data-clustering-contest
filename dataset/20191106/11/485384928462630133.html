      <p>Fifty years ago this week, beloved entertainer Carol Burnett appeared on the very first broadcast of a quirky television program that featured a bunch of furry puppets.</p>
      <h3>Key points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sesame Street was developed in conjunction with a developmental psychologist</li>
        <li>Its mission was to help low-income and minority children overcome education barriers</li>
        <li>Studies have shown exposure to the show improves a child's educational readiness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That show was Sesame Street and Ms Burnett, like a lot of kids, was instantly hooked.</p>
      <p>She would return to the show multiple times, including visits to demonstrate to pre-school viewers where her nose was and to smooch a rubber duckie.</p>
      <p>"I was a big fan. I would have done anything they wanted me to do," she said.</p>
      <blockquote>"I loved being exposed to all that goodness and humour."</blockquote>
      <p>This first episode of Sesame Street — sponsored by the letters W, S and E and the numbers 2 and 3 — aired on November 10, 1969.</p>
      <p>It was a turbulent time in the US, rocked by the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
      <p>Newt Minow, who was the US Federal Communications Commission chairman at the time, famously said television was becoming "a vast wasteland."</p>
      <p>Enter Sesame Street: Creators Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett worked with Harvard University developmental psychologist Gerald Lesser to build the show's unique approach with legendary puppeteer Jim Henson.</p>
      <p>Today the show reaches 120 million children globally.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't about if kids were learning from TV, it was about what they were learning from TV," said Steve Youngwood, the chief operating officer of Sesame Workshop.</p>
      <blockquote>"If they could harness that power to teach them the alphabet and their numbers as opposed to the words to beer commercials, you may be able to make a really big difference."</blockquote>
      <h3>Multiculturalism at the heart of Sesame Street's mission</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The show was designed by education professionals and child psychologists with one goal: to help low-income and minority students aged 2–5 overcome some of the deficiencies they had when entering school.</p>
      <p>Social scientists had long noted white and higher income kids were often better prepared.</p>
      <p>So, it wasn't an accident that the show was set on an urban street with a multicultural cast.</p>
      <p>Diversity and inclusion were baked into the show. Monsters, humans and animals all lived together peacefully.</p>
      <p>Bert, Ernie and the gang made an instant impression on actress Sonia Manzano, who starred in the show and wrote for it from 1971–2015 — including getting married on air.</p>
      <blockquote>"I was raised without seeing people of colour on television. So, when I was given the opportunity to be a person of colour on television, I jumped at it," said Ms Manzano, who is of Latino descent.</blockquote>

      <p>Over the years, Sesame Street has welcomed many more.</p>
      <p>It became the first children's program to feature someone with Down syndrome.</p>
      <p>It's had puppets with HIV and in foster care, invited children in wheelchairs, dealt with topics like jailed parents, homelessness, women's rights, military families and even girls singing about loving their hair.</p>
      <p>It introduced the bilingual Rosita — the first Latina Muppet — in 1991.</p>
      <p>Julia, a 4-year-old Muppet with autism came in 2017 and this year has offered help for kids whose parents are dealing with addiction and recovery.</p>
      <p>So important is the show that PETA recently asked for the creation of a vegan Muppet.</p>
      <p>"We are a mirror to society here even though we're dealing with birds and chickens and monsters," said Matt Vogel, the puppeteer who portrays Big Bird and the Count and who grew up watching Sesame Street.</p>
      <h3>Funding cuts have threatened to halt show's mission</h3>

      <p>There have been a few bumps in the road however, like Roosevelt, an early puppet whose stereotypical African American dialect offended many.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-24/katy-perry-pulled-from-sesame-street/2272706">Singer Katy Perry showed a little too much for some parents in 2010</a>, and Cookie Monster, in the face of an obesity epidemic, had to moderate his adoration of cookies to "a sometimes food."</p>
      <p>Others in the US have challenged the use of federal funds going to the program, which is technically a non-profit that earns millions on licensing for everything from lunch boxes and toys to nappies and commercials for Farmers Insurance.</p>
      <p>Big Bird in 2012 found himself unexpectedly in the presidential race when Mitt Romney said he would defund public broadcasting if elected.</p>
      <p>The US Government gives about 4 per cent — less than $US5 million ($7.25 million) a year — to the show in grants.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the longtime PBS show inked a five-year pact with HBO that gave the premium cable channel the right to air new episodes nine months before they air on PBS.</p>
      <p>That prompted some criticism that Sesame Workshop favoured viewers who could afford HBO over those who could not.</p>

      <h3>Sesame Street does improve educational readiness</h3>
      <p>In 2016, Wellesley College economics professor Phillip Levine and economist Melissa Kearney at the University of Maryland produced one of the most widely cited studies about the impact of Sesame Street.</p>
      <p>They compared households that got the show with those who didn't and found that the children exposed to Sesame Street were 14 per cent more likely to be enrolled in the correct grade level for their age at middle and high school.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/wef/status/1102633573989928961" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>"There's no question that the introduction of 'Sesame Street' was a good thing," Mr Levine said.</p>
      <blockquote>"Early childhood intervention does have the ability to improve lifelong learning among children."</blockquote>
      <p>Sesame Street is shown in more than 150 countries, has won 193 Emmys, 10 Grammys and will get a 2019 Kennedy Centre Honour for lifetime artistic achievement in December, the first time a television program will receive the award.</p>
      <p>But the show is still going strong despite an explosion of cheap online alternatives with bright colours and songs all vying for attention — one recent study found kids as young as 2 had a daily screen time diet of 3 hours.</p>
      <p>"There's a different version of a wasteland right now. And in some ways that motivates us even more to make sure that we, and the industry at large, doesn't give into that," the Sesame Workshop's Youngwood said.</p>
      <blockquote>"We have to earn their time every day as opposed to view that it's the entitlement."</blockquote>
