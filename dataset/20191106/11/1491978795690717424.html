        <i>Charges over attack in August on Guardian journalist deemed too serious for lower court</i>
      </p>
      <p>Three men charged with offences related to a late-night assault on Guardian journalist Owen Jones outside a pub in Islington, north London will have their case heard in a crown court.</p>
      <p>At a short hearing on Wednesday morning, a magistrates court sent the case to Snaresbrook crown court because the charges were deemed too serious to be dealt with by the lower court.</p>
      <p>Jones, 35, said he had been celebrating his birthday with friends when he was attacked at about 2am outside the Lexington public house in Islington, north London on 17 August.</p>
      <p>James Healy, 39, from Portsmouth; Liam Tracey, 34, from Camden, London; and Charlie Ambrose, 29, from Brighton, had been charged with actual bodily harm and affray.</p>
      <p>They did not enter a plea at the hearing and spoke only to confirm their names, address and nationality. They were told they had to appear at Snaresbrook crown court on 4 December.</p>
      <p>The three were granted bail subject to two conditions: not to make contact with Jones in any way, and not to enter the Lexington pub until the trial concludes.</p>
