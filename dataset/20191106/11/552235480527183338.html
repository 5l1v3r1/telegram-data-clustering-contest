      <h1>Celtic’s Europa League rivals Cluj receive big bonus BEFORE a ball has been kicked</h1>
      <h2>The Romanians have been handed a timely boost ahead of their group match with Rennes.</h2>

      <p>Celtic's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> rivals Cluj have been handed a timely cash boost ahead of their group match against Rennes on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The Romanian side have been hit with financial problems off the field as players and staff were promised a bonus from their European exploits this season, including their elimination of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The payment was delayed but Dan Petrescu's side will belatedly receive a £30,000 bonus as a cash injection from UEFA will arrive before kick-off against the French side.</p>
      <p>And that means that every player in the squad that has played in all of their 11 European games this season will receive £30,000 in payments and bonuses.</p>

      <p>Petrescu had earlier warned: "In every business in the world, if you promise wages and bonuses, then you have to pay what you are due.</p>
      <p>"It's not a good situation for the club to be in."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rennes">Rennes</a> will be boosted by the return of their veteran keeper Romain Salin for the clash...which will mean they won't have to field 16-year-old keeper Pepe Bonet.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Rennes had keeper Edouard Mendy sent off against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cfr-cluj">Cluj</a> last month and he is suspended for the clash and back-up veteran Salin was injured, meaning they had to use youngster Bonet as a sub against the Romanians.</p>
      <p>But Salin has recovered and the 35-year-old will be in goals at Cluj.</p>
