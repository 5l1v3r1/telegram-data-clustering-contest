        <b>Another season, another Drivers' and Constructors' Championship double for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a>, all might seem plain sailing from the outside, but Toto Wolff has insisted even a dominant season like 2019 has had its highs and lows.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> wrapped up World Championship number six for himself at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, P2 enough to seal the title. Mercedes have won 14 of the 19 races this season including an eighth race winning streak at the start of the season. </p>
      <p>It looks from the outside that it has been relatively easy for the Silver Arrows as a sixth double in as many years was comfortably completed. However, Toto Wolff has insisted this was far from the case.</p>

      <p><i>"Every championship seems the most difficult, but this year certainly had ups and downs,"</i> Wolff said as quoted by <a href="https://nl.motorsport.com/f1/news/toto-wolff-mercedes-f1-lewis-hamilton-wereldkampioen-austin/4592811/">Motorsport</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We got off to a great start, but for a long time, we didn't have the best package on Saturday. We managed to make the least mistakes on Sunday and I think that was the best.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The key to winning the championship. </i>
        <i>The fact that we were back in shape in Austin, with Valtteri who won this race and Lewis who secured the championship with a very strong pace, made this race the highlight of the year for me."</i>
