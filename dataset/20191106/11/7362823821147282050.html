      <p>“Na,” Suzuki said in response to whether he expected Trump’s hug. “I just enjoyed my time with my teammates."</p>
      <p>Suzuki was widely criticized for wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap while at the White House, but he brushed off the criticism. He added there was no animosity between his teammates regarding who went to the celebration and who didn’t.</p>
