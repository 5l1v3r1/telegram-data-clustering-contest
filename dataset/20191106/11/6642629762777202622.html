      <p>David Dimbleby has criticised the language used by politicians as "demeaning to democracy".</p>
      <p>The former Question Time host, 81, is back on the BBC with a Panorama programme about <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a>.</p>
      <p>Discussing the conversations he had with people while making the programme, he told BBC Radio 4's Today: "A particular thing that comes through is anger with the politicians and with the language that's used in politics.</p>
      <p>"That is incredibly important. The language of the 'surrender act' and all the stuff we've heard in the House of Commons has been quite demeaning to democracy."</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> has been criticised for describing attempts to block a no-deal break with the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> as the "surrender act".</p>
      <p>The former election night host also told the Radio 4 programme: "I've been following politics for a long time, and I've never seen a country more divided, mainly over the Brexit issue.</p>
      <p>"We started this film expecting October 31 to be the end, 'die in a ditch' ... no, it didn't happen.</p>
      <p>"Everywhere there is this irritation, discontent and incomprehension about why Parliament hasn't been able to implement what seemed to be a simple question in the referendum.</p>
      <p>"It's done terrible damage. It's complicated, and people don't like that."</p>
      <p>Dimbleby said his words to the nation on referendum night had backfired.</p>
      <p>"The referendum created a division. It asked people to be either A or B. No options, I think that was inevitably divisive.</p>
      <p>"When I said on referendum night: 'That's it, we're out', people thought: 'Oh well, that will happen tomorrow morning.'</p>
      <p>"I've been teased everywhere. 'You said, We'd be out. We're not.' It's my fault!"</p>
      <p>The veteran presenter dismissed quips by Today presenters that he had retired, saying: "I never said I was retiring! You stop doing one programme and you start doing others."</p>
      <p>And he said of not fronting this year's election night coverage, which will be hosted by Huw Edwards: "It will be weird for me, I love elections but I think 10 is enough."</p>
