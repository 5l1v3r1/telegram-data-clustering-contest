      <p>"Servant" will be the first major new series to land on ‌Apple TV‌+ following its launch last week. Apple debuted "The Morning Show," "See," "For All Mankind," and "Dickinson" as the major shows to kick off the service on November 1. <br/><br/>While Apple plans to upload new episodes of its hour-long shows like "The Morning Show" every Friday until their season finales, "Servant" is premiering on a Thursday with 10 episodes that last for 30 minutes each. This will be similar to the way the 30-minute show "Dickinson" was released on November 1. <br/><br/>Head to the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv.213/">MacRumors Apple TV+ forum</a> to join in discussions for all of the new shows that have launched, and will soon launch, on Apple's streaming service.</p>
