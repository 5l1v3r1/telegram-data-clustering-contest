        <b>Former foreign minister M Morshed Khan has resigned from the BNP as vice-chairman citing personal reasons.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He announced his resignation in a letter addressed to the party's Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I have resigned due to personal reasons. After thinking long and hard, I've come to the conclusion that I have nothing more to contribute to the party. Therefore I've resigned from the party," Morshed told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>The senior politician also criticised the BNP's leadership and said, "BNP is a massive party with huge popularity and public acceptance. This party is now running its operations over Skype. It's turned into the 'Bangladesh Nationalist Skype Party'. This is painful."</p>
      <p>"I believe the next generation must assume leadership roles within the party -- that would be my recommendation."</p>
      <p>Morshed's aide handed over the resignation letter to BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi at the party headquarters in Naya Paltan on Tuesday, according to an office staffer.</p>
      <p>But Rizvi said he was unaware of the matter when contacted.</p>
