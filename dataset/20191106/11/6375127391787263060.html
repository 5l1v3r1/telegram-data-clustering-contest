      <h3>A 37-year-old waitress was killed the other night by a still unidentified motorcycle-riding gunman who shot her in the face while she was playing cards in a wake in San Andres Bukid, Manila.</h3>
      <p>Margarita Santos, of 1664 Onyx St., San Andres Bukid, was killed on the spot while the suspect escaped aboard his plateless motorcycle.</p>
      <p>The Manila Police District-Crimes Against Persons Investigation Section (MPD-CAPIS) said that the incident took place at around 10 p.m. at a wake being held near the corner of Onyx and Estrada Streets.</p>
      <p>The victim was reportedly playing cards with two friends when the suspect arrived and shot her at close range, hitting her in the left cheek.</p>
      <p>The suspect then sped away toward Zobel Roxas Street while the victim was brought to the hospital where she was declared dead on arrival.Â </p>
