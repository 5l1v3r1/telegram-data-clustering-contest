      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/us-puerto-rico">Puerto Rico senator</a> awaiting trial on fraud charges <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">was taken into custody</a> Wednesday morning by federal authorities in connection with an investigation into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/corruption">alleged corruption</a> that also resulted in the arrests of seven others, officials said.</p>

      <p>Following Nazario's arrest, Puerto Rico's Senate President, Thomas Rivera Shatz, asked for Nazario's resignation. A spokesperson for Nazario told the Associated Press the senator maintains his innocence.</p>
      <p>Nazario was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/regulation/corruption">previously arrested</a> by federal authorities in September 2018 on charges of wire fraud and falsifying documents, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-pr/pr/senator-abel-nazario-qui-ones-indicted-and-arrested-falsifying-documents-and-wire-fraud">according</a> to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Puerto Rico. He was accused of defrauding his employees while serving as the mayor of Yauco, a southwestern town in Puerto Rico, where he was an elected official from 2000 until December 2016.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors allege that, while he was mayor, municipal employees were required "to work two voluntary hours per day" — which the U.S. Department of Labor determined was a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Nazario agreed to pay nearly $590,000 in back wages to 177 employees.</p>
      <p>Authorities, however, said they later learned the city of Yauco was withholding employees’ wages, despite Nazario’s pledge that he would not retaliate against workers.</p>

      <p>Nazario benefited from the money withheld from employees, investigators said. Then-Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló — <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/puerto-ricos-governor-resigns-over-offensive-messages-corruption-allegations">who resigned in August amid protests</a> — asked for Nazario's resignation, but he refused to step down.</p>
