      <p>Joe Swash has added more fuel to the rumours he and Stacey Solomon secretly got married during their romantic family holiday to the Maldives - by flashing what seems to be a wedding ring.</p>
      <p>The former I'm A Celebrity star was spotted on his way out of Dancing On Ice training in Essex, where he's been taking part in gruelling practice sessions with pro skater Alexandra Schauman.</p>
      <p>Dad of two Joe, 37, grinned as he spotted the cameras, before raising up his left hand to flash the gold band sitting on his ring finger.</p>
      <p>Joe kept tight-lipped as he left the ice-rink, dressed casually in a black tracksuit and matching cap.</p>

      <p>It came after he, Stacey, her sons Zachary, 11, and Leighton, seven, plus their baby son Rex jetted out to the Maldives for a sun-drenched romantic trip.</p>
      <p>While they were out there, Stacey shared a family picture of them all that sparked secret wedding rumours - because all the boys were wearing formal suits.</p>
      <p>Her eldest sons were in crisp beige linen jackets with white ties shirts and ties, while baby Rex beamed in his little linen rompersuit and bow-tie.</p>
      <p>Stacey and Joe were much more casually dressed, with Stacey in a flowing blue tunic dress and Joe in a matching cornflower blue shirt and beige shorts.</p>

      <p>Fans were convinced the formal outfits were a nod to Joe and Stacey's wedding ceremony, congratulating the two on tying the knot.</p>
      <p>But the couple have since revealed the truth behind the speculation.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> yesterday, Stacey said: "Hey, we just need to clear up.</p>
      <p>"Lots of people had messaged and commented to say they thought we got married. I'm only just reading through them all now and I'm like, 'Oh my god'."</p>
      <p>"We didn't get married," Joe interjected.</p>

      <p>Stacey then confirmed: "We wouldn't secretly get married anyway because I'd be so over the moon, I'd tell everyone.</p>
      <p>"All our families would be there, my family and Joe's family."</p>
      <p>Joe also cleared up the confusion about his ring, saying it definitely wasn't a hint at his marital status.</p>
      <p>"The rings I'm wearing are from my dad, he passed away when I was a kid so I wear them for luck," he explained.</p>
      <p>Stacey cheekily added that she had been expecting Joe to get down on bended knee considering what a romantic hotspot it is.</p>
      <p>"Secret gutted myself, would've been a great place for a proposal."</p>
      <p>Next time, Stacey!</p>
