      <h1>Angelina Jolie, 'The Eternals' cast evacuate set after bomb scare</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:56:25+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Hollywood star Angelina Jolie and other cast members from Marvel’s upcoming film <i>The Eternals</i> got a bit of a scare when a bomb was reportedly found on set this week.</p>
      <p>Multiple media outlets reported that production of the project was halted when the film’s crew found an unidentified object in the near vicinity, confirmed <i><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1089906/angelina-jolie-and-the-eternals-cast-evacuated-from-set-over-reported-bomb-scare">E! News</a></i>.</p>
      <p>“We have learnt that an unidentified object was found on the set where 2nd unit filming was taking place,”<i> E! News</i> wrote. “Per safety protocol, the area was inspected and deemed safe, and production resumed. No cast was present but the crew was asked to clear the area while the inspection occurred.”</p>

      <p>The filming was taking place on an island that was previously used as a German military base during the Second World War. Jolie is  shooting the project alongside A-listers Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek.</p>

      <p>“It was obviously terrifying – the bomb could have been there for decades untouched but who knows what might have happened if it was disturbed,” an insider told <i>The Sun</i>. “Some of the biggest stars in the world were on set and nobody was taking any chances. Fortunately, experts dealt with it.”</p>
      <p>Jolie has had a successful run of films this year, including starring in the newly released <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</i> where she returns as the misunderstood horned character.</p>

      <p>However, it seems like the Disney’s queen of darkness has had a slow first week, regardless of it being a $185 million film, opening with a disappointing $36 million, according to the<i> Los Angeles Times.</i></p>
      <p>On the personal front, Jolie recently opened up about her high-profile divorce from <i>Troy</i> actor Brad Pitt. The former Hollywood duo abruptly parted ways in 2016, after two years of marriage and over a decade together. <i>The Eternals</i> is slated for release late next year.</p>
