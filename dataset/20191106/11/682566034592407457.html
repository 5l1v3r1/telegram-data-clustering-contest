      <p>Lucknow - <b>West Indies</b> skipper <b>Kieron Pollard</b> won the toss and elected to bowl first in the opening one-day international against <b>Afghanistan</b> in smog-hit Lucknow on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>North India has been in the grip of severe pollution and schools were shut in New Delhi, with authorities declaring an emergency situation in the national capital.</p>
      <p>The air pollution in Lucknow - some 550km to the east - has also been "very unhealthy" with the reading for pollutants in the atmosphere hitting 249 micrograms per cubic metre on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The recommended World Health Organisation safe daily maximum is 25.</p>
      <p>Leg-spinner Hayden Walsh, who has played an ODI for the United States, makes his debut for West Indies alongside paceman Romario Shepherd.</p>
      <p>"We would want to exploit the moisture on the track," Pollard, the newly appointed limited-overs captain whose team lost the warm-up game to the Afghans, said at the toss.</p>
      <p>"We are playing four fast bowlers."</p>
      <p>Afghanistan, who have kept their home base in India since 2015, will play their first international game in Lucknow after away moving from Dehradun due to the lack of good hotels.</p>
      <p>The war-torn nation, who lost their opening Test to India inside two days last year, recently beat Bangladesh in a one-off five-day game under new captain Rashid.</p>
      <p>"We would want to go out and play positive cricket," said Rashid, the team's ace spinner.</p>
      <p>"We will take positive energy from the Bangladesh series. We have youngsters in our squad."</p>
      <p>Both captains did not discuss the air quality at the venue.</p>
      <p>Every winter, the northern states of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are blanketed by a poisonous smog of car fumes, industrial emissions and smoke from stubble burning on farms.</p>
      <p>Sunday's Twenty20 between India and Bangladesh was severely affected by pollution with Indian media reporting that two Bangladesh players vomited on the pitch at Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla ground.</p>
