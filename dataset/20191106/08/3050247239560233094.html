      <h1>‘Bullish for Bitcoin’ — China Scraps Plans to Ban Cryptocurrency Mining</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:22:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:22</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) mining will not face a state crackdown in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">China</a>, authorities have confirmed in new official documents. As noted by Blockstream CSO <a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1191962358429691909">Samson Mow</a> and others on Nov. 6, mining no longer features on a list of industries Beijing considers undesirable. </p>
      <h3>“Bullish for Bitcoin”</h3>
      <p>The change came via a <a href="http://www.ndrc.gov.cn/gzdt/201911/W020191106310206237723.pdf">new edition</a> of China’s Industrial Structure Adjustment Guidance Catalog, which will take effect from the start of 2020.</p>
      <p>“China’s National Development and Reform Commission has removed #cryptocurrency mining from the list of industries they want to eliminate. Bullish for #Bitcoin,” Mow commented.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-state-macroeconomic-planning-agency-mulls-ban-on-crypto-mining">previous incarnation</a> of the document earlier this year had conversely included Bitcoin mining as one of the government’s targets.</p>
      <p>The news marks a rare boon for Bitcoin-related activities in China, a country where cryptocurrency outside the control of the central bank remains all but banned.</p>
      <h3>BTC markets calm</h3>
      <p>The recent <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-blockchain-is-the-future-but-keep-it-rational-avoid-aircoins">endorsement</a> of blockchain technology from president Xi Jinping coincided with a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-chart-now-looks-ridiculous-after-record-gains-analyst">dramatic rise</a> in BTC/USD, after which local media <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-warns-against-cryptocurrency-speculation-amid-blockchain-hype">cautioned</a> on misinterpreting the remarks as supportive of crypto. </p>
      <p>Following the most recent announcement, however, little appeared to change on Bitcoin markets.</p>
      <p>Mining has long formed a profitable industry in China, with cheap electricity meaning major participants still reside there. Canaan Creative, one of the biggest Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers, will reportedly undergo a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-mining-giant-canaan-to-go-public-in-us-in-november-sources">$400 million</a> initial public offering, or IPO, later this month.</p>
