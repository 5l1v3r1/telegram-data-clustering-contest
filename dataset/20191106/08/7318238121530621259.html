      <h1>Serbian leader uses side door of TV studio as protest blocks entrance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:59:46+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author">EuronewsÂ </a></address>
      <p>Hundreds of Serbian opposition protesters have blocked the main entrance to the building housing the country's state broadcaster, forcing the visiting Serbian president to use a side door.</p>
      <p>Aleksandar Vucic managed to dodge the angry protest on Tuesday night, which was organised in opposition of the perceived government control of Serbian media.</p>
      <p>It came as Vucic was due to give a live interview to the broadcaster, RTS TV, which is accused by protesters of allowing the president to stage his media appearances and avoid difficult questions.</p>
      <p>Vucic denies these accusations.</p>

      <p>A special police unit stepped in on Tuesday to prevent violence between the opposition protesters and around 100 of Vucic's supporters.</p>
      <p>Vucic posted a photo on Instagram from inside the RTS studio, saying he had gone in via the side entrance.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank everyone for their support," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Most opposition parties are set to boycott next year's parliamentary elections over accusations that there is not a level playing field for the campaign. European Union-mediated talks between them and Vucic's Serbian Progressive party have not yet reached agreement.</p>
      <p>The Alliance for Serbia, a loose grouping of opposition political parties and movements, have been staging weekly rallies for almost a year to protest the rule of Vucic's Progressive Party of Serbia, which they say is autocratic, corrupt, and stifling media freedoms and democracy.</p>
      <p>Vucic and his party have denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>Serbia has dropped 14 places on the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, ranking 90th of the 180 states.</p>
