      <h1>Microsoft Movies and TV app apparently has a future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:12:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:12</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft has been increasingly getting out of the consumer content business, shuttering the Groove music store and their ebook store.</p>
      <p>One application which inexplicably kept going is the Movies and TV app and service, and, going by a tweet by <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/rudy-huyn-completed-journey-ends-up-at-microsoft/">new Microsoft employee Rudy Huyn,</a> the plan is to develop it even further.</p>

      <p>Rudy indicates that Microsoft is looking for a Senior Engineer to “build the future of Microsoft Movies &amp; TV (and more)” with the job post noting:</p>
      <blockquote>We build and maintain applications and services that power Microsoft Movies&amp;TV on hundreds of millions of Windows 10 based devices including Xbox, HoloLens and Surface.</blockquote>
      <p>Of course, Microsoft does have a built-in market for videos with their Xbox product, but with plans to once again make a phone, one wonders if we are seeing a revival of Microsoft’s consumer ambitions.</p>
