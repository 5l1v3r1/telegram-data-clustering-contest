      <h1>Ally McCoist delivers emphatic Celtic and Rangers verdict as he hails Europa League heroics</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox legend has been thrilled watching the Premiership sides on the continent so far this term.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:20:15+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:20</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Ally McCoist believes Celtic and Rangers have been "a breath of fresh air" in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League </a>this season.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow giants are both in contention to qualify for the knock out stage after big performances against Lazio and Porto last time out.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon's side came from behind to stun the Italians at Parkhead and a repeat result at the Stadio Olimpico on Thursday could see <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> through if results elsewhere go their way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>, meanwhile, are bidding to follow up an impressive draw in Portugal with three points against the Primeira Liga big guns.</p>

      <p>And Ibrox icon <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ally-mccoist">McCoist</a> insists those exploits have provided a timely boost for Scottish football, with each result influencing the all-important UEFA coefficient.</p>
      <p>"Celtic and Rangers have been a breath of fresh air," McCoist told <a href="https://talksport.com/">talkSPORT</a>.</p>
      <p>"Celtic got a great result against Lazio at home, now that'll be very, very tough for them (in Rome).</p>
      <p>"Rangers, I thought, were excellent in Porto and they've got a tough one at home.</p>
      <p>"I think both teams are flying the flag, which is good to see - because we need a little bit of a boost, don't we?"</p>

      <p>Celtic currently sit top of Group E on seven points, and victory in Rome combined with anything but a Rennes win against Cluj would clinch qualification.</p>
      <p>Rangers' task is taller, with all four teams in Group G within three points of each other.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard's side sit second with four points, two behind leaders Young Boys and level with Porto.</p>
      <p>Feyenoord currently prop up the group with just three points.</p>
