      <h1>Indonesian mother hides newborn in washing machine out of shame that she had it out of wedlock, baby dies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:26:56+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>A woman in the Indonesian city of Palembang has been arrested on suspicion of infanticide, in which the victim is her own newborn baby.</p>
      <p>The suspect, identified as 36-year-old Sutina, was a babysitter who worked at the residence of South Sumatra’s former vice governor Ishak Mekki. On Monday, she gave birth to her baby by herself at the mansion. A couple of hours after the birth, she wrapped up the baby in cloth and hid it inside a washing machine.</p>
      <p>“I put the baby in the washing machine, but I didn’t set it to tumble. I just wrapped it in a blanket because I was ashamed,” Sutina told reporters at a press conference held by local police yesterday, <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4773511/kisah-horor-sutina-bunuh-bayi-di-tabung-mesin-cuci?single=1">as quoted by </a><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4773511/kisah-horor-sutina-bunuh-bayi-di-tabung-mesin-cuci?single=1"><i>Detik</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Sutina explained that she had the child out of wedlock, and that her boyfriend went MIA after finding out she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>The babysitter said she never intended to kill the baby because she was only going to keep the baby in the washing machine for a little while.</p>
      <p>“My plan was to take the baby to an orphanage, I had no intention to kill,” she said.</p>
      <p>Sutina’s colleague at work found the baby after she heard its cries from inside the washing machine. The baby was then taken to a hospital, where it passed away.</p>
      <p>Authorities say they’re conducting an autopsy on the baby to determine the cause of death.</p>
      <p>Sutina was charged with infanticide under Indonesia’s Child Protection Law, and may face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.</p>
      <p>Giving birth out of wedlock is generally considered taboo in Indonesia, and that stories about mothers dumping babies are depressingly common. In Bali, a woman is currently on trial for <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/bali-prosecutor-demands-7-years-prison-for-26-y-o-woman-who-allegedly-killed-her-newborn/">allegedly killing and dumping her newborn in a trash can in order to hide the shame of having the baby out of wedlock</a>.</p>
