      <h3>Maruti Suzuki’s S-Presso was the 8th best-selling passenger vehicle in the month of October 2019</h3>
      <p>Maruti Suzuki’s newly launched S-Presso marked the entry of a whole new segment called the “mini-SUV” in the Indian market. The first of its kind, S-Presso has certainly received a positive response in the country, and the Japanese carmaker managed to sell 10,634 units of the car in its first month of going on sale i.e. October 2019.</p>
      <p>Maruti Suzuki has priced the S-Presso between Rs 3.69 lakh and Rs 4.91 lakh (ex-showroom India), which makes it rival the brand’s very own entry segment Alto, and other cars including the also newly facelifted Renault Kwid, the Tata Tiago among others. The S-Presso has managed to outsell all its competitors from other manufacturers and was placed on eighth in terms of total sales; the top-10 list of which was largely dominated by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, with 8 cars out of the 10.</p>
      <p>The S-Presso packs a tall-SUV like stance along with funky looks at an affordable price, something which the manufacturer believes pleases the young audience. Powering the S-Presso is a 998 cc engine that churns out 67 HP of max power and 90 Nm peak torque, and is paired to a 5-speed manual transmission with an optional AMT.</p>

      <p>The S-Presso is available in four trims, namely Std, LXi, VXi and VXi+. The top-variant gets a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system integrated with Maruti’s Smartplay Studio 2.0, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. It also comes with steering mounted audio and Bluetooth controls, front power windows, a 12V power socket, HVAC and a rear parcel tray.</p>
      <p>In terms of safety, the S-Presso complies with the latest government norms, which means it gets a driver side airbag, ABS with EBD, front seat-belt reminders, high-speed alert, speed sensing door auto lock and rear parking sensors as standard. An additional passenger airbag is also offered on the top-end VXi+ variant.</p>
