      <p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/"><i>The Wrap</i></a> reports that Andy Serkis, who’ll direct <i>Venom 2</i>, is in line to play Bruce Wayne’s trusted butler, Alfred Pennyworth.</p>
      <p>The Penguin was most memorably played by Danny DeVito in Tim Burton’s <i>Batman Returns</i>. Meanwhile, since 1989, Pennyworth has been played by Michael Gough, Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons.</p>
      <p><i>The Batman</i> is expected to start filming in early 2020 ahead of a release date of 25 June 2021.</p>
