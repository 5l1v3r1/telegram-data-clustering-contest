        <b>Cannot wait.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Christopher Nolan has debuted the cryptic new trailer for <i>Tenet</i>, his forthcoming eleventh project.</p>
      <p>In the first clip from the British director’s latest movie, we see <i>BlacKkKlansman</i> star John David Washington surveying a series of bullet-holes littered across a reinforced pane of glass.</p>
      <p>The action then cuts to footage of a riot squad heading into action, alongside what appears to be a particularly brutal interrogation.</p>
      <p>In true Nolan style, the mystery intensifies right at the end as Washington’s character is seen wearing an oxygen mask, before the screen fades to white.</p>
      <p>Although the project remains shrouded in secrecy, an official IMDB listing describes the film as “an action epic revolving around international espionage, time travel, and evolution.”</p>

      <p>The film, which is set for release on July 17 2020, also stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Robert Pattinson,  Himesh Patel, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Dimple Kapadia, and Michael Caine. Ludwig Göransson, who won an Oscar for his work on <a href="http://nme.com/tag/black-panther"><i>Black Panther</i></a>, will handle the score.</p>
      <p>Pattinson revealed earlier this year that<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/robert-pattinson-locked-in-a-room-to-read-the-script-for-christopher-nolans-next-film-2472859"> he was locked in a room to read the script for the film</a>. “I don’t have it myself,” he told <i>USA Today, </i>adding that it was “unreal”.</p>
