      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, November 6 – Just like many tourists who have visited Batu Caves, South Korean DJ Soda was in for a special yet amusing experience by the site’s long-tailed residents recently.</p>
      <p>The South Korean DJ, whose real name is Hwang So-hee, posted her wild yet hilarious encounter with one of the cheeky monkeys at Batu Caves on Instagram, and set social media users abuzz.</p>
      <p>The 32-second video contained a compilation footages of her freaking out and screaming as the monkey tried to jump over her head and snatch the food she was holding to feed them.</p>
      <p>The short clip was also accompanied by a caption saying her throat is hurting so bad due to screaming a lot.</p>

      <p>Despite having to deal with a mischievous creature, the 31-year-old artist never failed to entertain the furry macaques of the historic site.</p>
      <p>DJ Soda arrived in Malaysia on November 1 and has since been exploring the town in her signature yellow limousine.</p>
      <p>Her visit to Kuala Lumpur is part of her tour where she performed in Y Club Kuala Lumpur last Friday.</p>

      <p>Apart from Batu Caves, she also visited KL Tower and tried the famous Damansra Uptown Village Park’s nasi lemak along with other local delicacies such as gulai ayam and keropok.</p>
      <p>In another video, the young DJ was seen eating a packet of nasi lemak with her hands in true Malaysian fashion.</p>
      <p>“It was a real hectic day till I couldn't have my meals.</p>
      <p>“So I ate this famous nasi lemak ayam like a pig which is from Village Park where locals queue for it,” she wrote on her Instagram.</p>
