      <p>Charlie Nicholas claims Celtic got lucky against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> as he tipped the Italians to exact revenge this week.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon's side roared back from a goal down to defeat the Serie A giants 2-1 on a stirring <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> night at Parkhead in October.</p>
      <p>It was a recovery <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charlie-nicholas">Nicholas</a> described as "brilliant" - but he believes Simone Inzaghi's side should've been out of sight before Ryan Christie and Christopher Jullien turned the result on its head.</p>
      <p>The former Hoops striker predicts an angry reaction from the Serie A giants and is backing a narrow 1-0 home win at the Stadio Olimpico on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11854247/charlie-nicholas-europa-league-predictions-how-will-arsenal-man-utd-wolves-celtic-rangers-do">Sky Sports</a>: "I am feeling a bit awkward about this one. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> did brilliantly to beat them with a last-gasp winner first time around.</p>

      <p>"I did flag up a 2-1 win, but they were fortunate. Celtic needed to take a good scalp eventually.</p>
      <p>"In this one, do they attack, counter-attack or sit in? They are not a team that naturally sit in. Domestically, they have 70 per cent of the ball.</p>
      <p>"Celtic are getting better at it and Neil Lennon is asking them to play the ball forward much quicker.</p>
      <p>Lazio will be angry and agitated as they should have gone two or three up at Celtic Park. The Serie A side must win here to stay in the group.</p>
      <p>"Cluj will win I think so it may come down to head-to-head with these two sides. Lazio went fourth in Serie A and will get their revenge in this one."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Nicholas has predicted <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> will earn a repeat of their 1-1 draw in Estadio do Dragao as Porto head for Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos secured a precious point last time out and a similar result would keep Steven Gerrard's side in contention to reach the knockout stage.</p>
      <p>Nicholas added: "It is hard to pin who wins this group and this result will leave it wide open with a draw."</p>
