        <b>France has announced the death of a top jihadist leader in Mali, as it continues to push for European support in fighting the Islamist insurgency in the Sahel.</b>
      </p>
      <p>French Defence Minister Florence Parly told the AFP news agency that French troops killed Ali Maychou, a Moroccan, and co-founder of Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), or the Group to Support Islam and Muslims.</p>
      <p>He was "the second most-wanted terrorist in the Sahel, including by the Americans", after JNIM's number one Iyad Ag Ghaly, she said, on board a French government plane, returning from an official visit to the region.</p>
      <p>The group has claimed responsibility for the biggest attacks in the Sahel since its official launch in 2017. It is made up of several jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).</p>
      <p>Maychou was killed during the night of 8-9 October, with the help of Malian troops and US support, Parly said.</p>
      <p>He joined AQIM in 2012 before co-founding JNIM with Ghaly and expanding it in the Sahel.</p>
      <p>
        <b>France seeking support in Mali</b>
      </p>
      <p>France’s Barkhane force, with 4,500-troops, has been in the Sahel since 2014, supporting the Malian government, <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/tag/g5-sahel/">along with Mali’s African neighbours</a> and 13,000 United Nations peacekeepers, to contain the Islamist insurgency. But continued deadly assaults have shown the fragility of the region.</p>
      <p>In the latest attack claimed by militants allied with the Islamic State armed group, <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20191102-mali-terrorist-attack-military-post-kills-54-mainly-soldiers-jihadist-g5-sahel">on Friday, gunmen shot dead 49 Malian troops</a> at an army base near the border with Niger. Over the weekend, <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20191103-islamic-state-group-claims-mali-attacks-killed-50-including-french-soldier-menaka">two Malian soldiers and a French soldier were killed</a>.</p>
      <p>Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said Friday's attack shows the help of foreign forces is "necessary more than ever".</p>
      <p>France has been trying to convince European partners to boost military assistance, and Parly said on Tuesday in Mali that a decision was imminent.</p>
      <p>"By 2020, special forces from European countries will be deployed in Mali alongside the French special forces to pass on exceptional know-how" to Mali's army, she said during a visit to the northern city of Gao.</p>
      <p>She added that around a dozen countries had been approached to join the unit -- to be named "Takuba", which means "sabre" in the Tuareg language/</p>
      <p>Participation is conditional on votes in national parliaments but Parly said she was "optimistic".</p>
