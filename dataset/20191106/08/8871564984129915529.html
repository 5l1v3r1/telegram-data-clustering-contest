      <p>Yes, <i>Cats. </i>One of the longest-running shows in both West End and Broadway history, premiering at the New London Theater in 1981 where it played a record of 21 years and staged around 9,000 performances — <i>that </i>musical — will be staged at Parañaque City’s Solaire Theater for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The multiple-Tony-award-winning production, based on T.S. Eliot’s <i>Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats,</i> features seven of its beloved feline characters (say the names with us): Rum Tum Tugger, Mr. Mistoffelees, Macavity, Jennyanydots, Old Deuteronomy, Grizabella, and Skimbleshanks, all of whom converge for a night at the Jellicle Ball.</p>
      <p>If that all sounds gibberish, know that the role of Grizabella, once played by Lea Salonga in 2010, will be reprised by theater darling Joanna Ampil. Tickets start at PHP1,567 (US$30), and are available at the Ticketworld <a href="https://www.ticketworld.com.ph/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=A2CFBF21-3FA6-4A2C-B196-F99464F34E23">website</a>.

      <p><b>Date: </b>Nov. 7, Thursday<b><br/>Venue: </b>Xylo at the Palace, 36 9th Ave, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig</p>
      <p>Filipino-Canadian singer-rapper duo Soliven and Neeko, jointly known as Manila Grey, will be performing at the hip Taguig City club Xylo at the Palace. The duo describes their sound as a bridge between “modern Eastern aesthetics with atmospheric R&amp;B and rap sonics.”</p>
      <p>Translation: you can dance to it, and given Xylo at the Palace is a pretty roomy club, go do your thing. Despite moving to Canada, Manila Grey is keen to rep Filipino culture and include Filipino elements in their music videos, including rice cookers and Asian convenience stores.</p>
      <p>Feel like tucking in to this club party? Door charge is at PHP1,500 (US$30).</p>
