      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/ziont">Zion.T</a> says he and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/jeon-so-mi">Jeon So Mi</a> are collaborating on new music.<br/><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/02/jeon-so-mi-teases-collaboration-with-the-black-label-labelmate-ziont"><br/>This past February</a>, Jeon So Mi shared a photo of herself in the studio with Zion.T and other producers at <b>The Black Label</b>, and it looks like they're working on more music together. In an interview for his upcoming album '<b>May</b>', Zion.T expressed, <i>"It might be sudden, but I wish to work with an artist I don't know well. Instead of it feeling like a collaboration with an artist I already know well, I want to try producing the entire concept and more. I think it would be fun."<br/><br/></i>Along with his hopes to focus on producing, he said about his labelmate Jeon So Mi, <i>"Jeon So Mi is in my agency, and I meet up with her often to talk about songs. I let her listen to songs and ask her if she thinks it'd be good for her to sing and if she wants to try it. We're working hard together."<br/><br/></i>Stay tuned for updates!</p>
