      <p>A man <a href="https://asnn.prod.ewscripps.psdops.com/news/national/suspect-in-custody-one-day-after-texas-mass-shooting">arrested</a> in connection with a mass shooting at a college homecoming party has been <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Accused-Greenville-Shooter-Released-After-Exculpatory-Evidence-Discovered-Sheriff-Says-564529501.html">released</a> after a district attorney <a href="https://www.kxxv.com/hometown/texas/suspect-in-shooting-at-college-halloween-party-in-east-texas-that-killed-2-and-injured-a-dozen-more-has-been-released">dropped capital murder charges against him.</a></p>
      <p>Brandon Ray Gonzales was released from jail on Tuesday. He was arrested Oct. 28 in connection with a <a href="https://asnn.prod.ewscripps.psdops.com/news/national/at-least-2-killed-and-10-injured-in-texas-mass-shooting">mass shooting</a> that killed two and injured six others at an event center in Greenville, Texas on Oct. 26.</p>
      <p>Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said Gonzales was released after "additional information" had come to light, according to the <a href="https://www.kxxv.com/hometown/texas/suspect-in-shooting-at-college-halloween-party-in-east-texas-that-killed-2-and-injured-a-dozen-more-has-been-released">Associated Press.</a></p>
      <p>The Oct. 26 shooting occurred at an event space called The Party Spot in Greenville, Texas. The shooting happened during a homecoming party for students and alumni of nearby Texas A&amp;M-Commerce.</p>
      <p>Gunfire also broke out at a <a href="https://asnn.prod.ewscripps.psdops.com/news/national/gunfire-breaks-out-at-vigil-held-for-victims-of-mass-shooting-at-texas-party">vigil for the victims</a> of the shooting the following night.</p>
      <p>In the hours after the shooting, investigators told reporters they had trouble identifying suspects due to a lack of witness cooperation. Meeks echoed those sentiments on Tuesday upon Gonzales' release.</p>
