        <b>'This Is How' is out now.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The estate of the late <a href="http://nme.com/artists/george-michael">George Michael</a> has released ‘This Is How (We Want You To Get High)’, the first posthumous track to arrived from the late music icon.</p>
      <p>The track will feature on the soundtrack of <i>Last Christmas</i> – the upcoming movie inspired by his legendary back catalogue.</p>
      <p>It received its  first play on BBC Radio 2’s <i>The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show</i> on Wednesday, November 6.</p>
      <p>“The previously unreleased track, which was recorded during George’s final studio sessions, is his first original material to be shared for seven years,” a press release said.</p>
      <p>“The lyrics, written exclusively by George, see the star addressing society’s ills with his trademark blend of self-deprecation and wry humor.”</p>
      <p>It is also accompanied by a lyric video which features animations of Michael performing.</p>

      <p>An upbeat effort, Michael sings on the track:<i> “Your daddy was a drinker”, “My daddy was a toker”</i></p>
      <p>The soundtrack for the festive movie will feature three Wham! songs, including ‘Last Christmas’ and ‘Everything She Wants’, alongside 12 of Michael’s solo songs.</p>
      <p>The festive rom-com is directed by <i>Bridesmaids</i>‘ Paul Feig and stars Emilia Clarke as a fed-up seasonal worker who keeps bumping into Henry Golding’s character around London in serendipitous circumstances.</p>
      <p>It also stars Emma Thompson, who has penned the film, as Clarke’s mother.</p>
      <p>Speaking recently, Thompson explained how Michael gave<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/emma-thompson-on-how-george-michael-gave-his-blessing-to-write-last-christmas-film-2562466"> her his personal blessing to create the upcoming film.</a></p>
      <p>“He was just the loveliest guy you could imagine,” she recalled of their meeting. “[He loved] all of these themes in the movie; he was passionate about homelessness, and he had this great social conscience.”</p>
      <p>Thompson continued: “I got really enthused and we started to write, and then – of course – he had that tragic early death in 2016, on Christmas Day. So we lost him, and I miss him so much.”</p>
