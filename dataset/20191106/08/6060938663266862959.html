      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:30:57+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Since stepping up on the big screen with her film ‘Kedarnath’ followed by the hugely successful ‘Simmba’, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sara-Ali-Khan">Sara Ali Khan</a> has had all eyes on her. With her films making as much noise as her love life, and her popularity growing by the day, things are only looking up for her.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a career in show business was not the only option on the beauty’s mind. The beauty, who earned a degree from Columbia University before pursuing her Bollywood dreams, revealed in an interview that she would have pursued a career as a lawyer or a politician if she didn’t take up acting.</p>
      <p>Elaborating further, she also said that studying abroad gave her a sense of independence and made her more tolerant and inclusive. She even says that she encourages her brother to study someplace far from home.</p>
      <p>Currently busy working on ‘Coolie No. 1’ with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Varun-Dhawan">Varun Dhawan</a>, the actress is also awaiting the release of director Imtiaz Ali’s romantic flick ‘Aaj Kal’ that will see her share the screen with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kartik-Aaryan">Kartik Aaryan</a>.</p>
