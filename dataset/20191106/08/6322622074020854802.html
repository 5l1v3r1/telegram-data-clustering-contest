      <p>SEOUL (Nov 6): A South Korean service is offering free funerals - but only to the living.</p>
      <p>More than 25,000 people have participated in mass “living funeral” services at Hyowon Healing Center since it opened in 2012, hoping to improve their lives by simulating their deaths.</p>
      <p>“Once you become conscious of death, and experience it, you undertake a new approach to life,” said 75-year-old Cho Jae-hee, who participated in a recent living funeral as part of a “dying well” program offered by her senior welfare center.</p>
      <p>Dozens took part in the event, from teenagers to retirees, donning shrouds, taking funeral portraits, penning their last testaments, and lying in a closed coffin for around 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>University student Choi Jin-kyu said his time in the coffin helped him realize that too often, he viewed others as competitors.</p>
      <p>“When I was in the coffin, I wondered what use that is,” said the 28-year-old, adding that he plans to start his own business after graduation rather than attempting to enter a highly-competitive job market.</p>
      <p>South Korea ranks 33 out of 40 countries surveyed in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Better Life Index. Many younger South Koreans have high hopes for education and employment, which have been dashed by a cooling economy and rising joblessness.</p>
      <p>“It is important to learn and prepare for death even at a young age,” said Professor Yu Eun-sil, a doctor at Asan Medical Center’s pathology department, who has written a book about death.</p>
      <p>In 2016, South Korea’s suicide rate was 20.2 per 100,000 residents, almost double the global average of 10.53, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
      <p>Funeral company Hyowon began offering the living funerals to help people appreciate their lives, and seek forgiveness and reconciliation with family and friends, said Jeong Yong-mun, who heads the healing center.</p>
      <p>Jeong said he is heartened when people reconcile at a relative’s funeral, but is saddened they wait that long.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have forever,” he said. “That’s why I think this experience is so important - we can apologize and reconcile sooner and live the rest of our lives happily.”</p>
      <p>Occasionally he has dissuaded those contemplating suicide.</p>
      <p>“I picked out those people who have asked themselves whether ... they can actually commit suicide, and I reversed their decision,” Jeong said.</p>
      <p>The message of personal value resounded with Choi.</p>
      <p>“I want to let people know that they matter, and that someone else would be so sad if they were gone,” he said, wiping away tears. “Happiness is in the present.”</p>
