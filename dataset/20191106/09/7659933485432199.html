      <p>Qatar and Turkey reaffirmed their desire to scale up bilateral relations and create a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” Doha’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani tweeted following a ministerial meeting with Turkish officials.<br/><br/>Ankara is considered a major ally of Doha which is dealing with a prolonged boycott by fellow Gulf Arab states.<br/><br/>After signing a military cooperation agreement, on April 28, 2014 between the Qatari Ministry of Defense and the Turkish Ministry of Defense, Ankara established a military base in Qatar.<br/><br/>Doha has acted in defiance of the Arab League last month when it voiced support for the Turkish operation against Kurdish forces in northeast Syria.<br/><br/>Other Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, condemned Turkey’s “aggression” as a threat to regional peace and security and a violation of Syria’s sovereignty.<br/><br/>According to AFP, Qatar, which supported the Syrian opposition in the conflict against the Syrian regime, failed to condemn the Turkish attack amid criticism from several Arab countries.<br/><br/>Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu personally thanked Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad for supporting the operation during a meeting in Doha. In a tweet, he described Qatar as a “brotherly” nation and conveyed the greetings of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.<br/><br/>Turkey and Qatar have grown closer since Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain launched a boycott of Doha over its links to extremist groups. Ankara boosted its military presence in Qatar and Doha promised support for Turkey’s economy.</p>
