      <p>Celtic have signed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/callum-mcgregor">Callum McGregor</a> on a new five-year contract.</p>
      <p>The stylish midfielder is the latest player in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>’s squad to be tied down on a long deal following Scott Bain and James Forrest.</p>
      <p>It’s a one-year extension for McGregor who was previously under contract until 2023. He will now remain with the champions until 2024.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has been a massive part of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>’s incredible treble Treble haul. He has made 290 appearances in the Hoops, scoring 55 times.</p>
      <p>McGregor’s trophy haul reads: five league titles, three Scottish Cups and three Betfred Cups.</p>
      <p>Last season’s player of the year will be one of Lennon’s first names on his teamsheet for Thursday night’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> showdown with Lazio.</p>
      <p>Last week Bain and Forrest signed new deals while the manager also strongly hinted at fresh terms for skipper Scott Brown.</p>
      <p>McGregor is also seen as a successor to Brown’s captaincy.</p>
      <p>A club statement read: "Celtic are delighted to announce that Callum McGregor has signed a new five-year contract that will see him remain at the club until at least the summer of 2024."</p>
