      <p><b>THE HAGUE, NetherlandsÂ (AP)</b> - Global retailer Ahold Delhaize says soaring online sales and a strong performance in the United States have driven up revenue, while net profit edged lower in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Stop &amp; Shop, Food Lion and Hannaford stores in the United States, said Wednesday that sales based on constant exchange rates rose 2.9% to 16.7 billion euros ($18.5 billion) compared with the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>Net profit fell 4.1% to 453 million, excluding currency rate fluctuations, due in part to higher insurance and other costs.</p>
      <p>Sales rose 2% in the company's U.S. stores.</p>
      <p>CEO Frans Muller says, "We saw a strong overall performance at our U.S. brands, particularly at Food Lion and Hannaford."</p>
