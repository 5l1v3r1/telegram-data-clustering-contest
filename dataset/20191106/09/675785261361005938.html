      <h1>Piers Morgan monsters Tory chairman over doctored election video in TV car crash</h1>
      <h2>The Tories doctored a clip of Labour on ITV's Good Morning Britain - now chairman James Cleverly has been savaged on exactly the same show. Karma is a cruel mistress</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T09:04:44+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 09:04</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>You might call it a punishment to fit the crime.</p>
      <p>The Tories' chairman has been absolutely monstered on breakfast TV for putting out a doctored video - of someone, er, being 'monstered' on breakfast TV.</p>
      <p>James Cleverly, who was savaged by ITV host Piers Morgan for cynically editing footage of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> on the previous day's Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>In a car crash interview, Mr Cleverly spent more than 10 minutes trying to pretend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-push-fake-news-doctored-20818433">a "fake news lie" of Keir Starmer talking about Brexit</a> was not doctored, when it clearly was to anyone who has eyes.</p>
      <p>In the end he tried to shut down host Piers Morgan and leave for a different interview - as he said exasperated: "for goodness sake Piers, let me finish!"</p>

      <p>Well, the person the Tories didn't let finish was Mr Starmer.</p>
      <p>Yesterday's original GMB interview saw Piers Morgan ask the Shadow Brexit Secretary why he thought the EU would give Labour a good deal, if there was a risk they'd campaign against it in a second referendum.</p>
      <p>Their doctored video, viewed well over a million times, inserted several seconds of video showing Sir Keir's face in silence - apparently after the question.</p>
      <p>But in reality, Sir Keir immediately replied: "Well, Piers, I have been talking to the EU, to political leaders across the EU 27 countries for the last three years, and I know very well what the parameters are of any deal they would do with a Labour government.</p>
      <p>"We actually explored some of it in the cross-party talks that we were in with the government six months or so ago.</p>
      <p>"So I know that a customs union and single market alignment, and protection of workers' rights and environmental rights and consumer rights is something that can be negotiated."</p>
      <p>Mr Cleverly was also slammed over the video by the BBC today, where Radio 4 host Nick Robinson told him: "You put something out deliberately to mislead."</p>
      <p>But by far the most scathing criticism was from Piers Morgan - who said James Cleverly's "shameless" refusal to accept the video was doctored was "staggering".</p>
      <p>"You seem completely unconcerned," he raged at the Tory HQ chief. "The Conservative Party website, the official one, posted a fake video, that had a fake moment that never happened, on TV.</p>
      <p>"If you're prepared to do that on day one of a campaign, why should we believe any video or anything that you guys put up?"</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>James Cleverly insisted: "The official Conservative Campaign HQ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account put out your video.</p>
      <p>"What we did is because we wanted to make sure the video was short and punchy we had to take out an awful lot of the waffle."</p>
      <p>Mr Cleverly neglected to mention that CCHQ only shared the full interview after criticism about its doctored version.</p>
      <p>"He did answer the question. You may not like the answer!" Piers Morgan told him. "You changed the video... It's misleading and it's a lie!"</p>
      <p>Even a Tory candidate apologised last night after sharing the video.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Johnny Mercer said: "It would appear this has inexplicably been doctored at the end. I apologise and will remove it. The original interview was bad enough."</p>
      <p>Piers Morgan said: "Johnny Mercer, who retweeted the fake one, has now put a grovelling apology out on his Twitter account for putting out basically a lie.</p>
      <p>"And I'm staggered frankly that you're not prepared to sit here - you've always struck me as an honourable, straight talker - how can you defend this? It's fake news!"</p>
      <p>Mr Morgan added he was "talking a load of flannel" and "defending fake news."</p>
      <p>Yet Mr Cleverly continued to defend the fake video in a cringeworthy exchange.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "In the whole of that exchange, Sir Keir Starmer who is the Shadow Brexit Secretary was unable to credibly explain Labour's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> position. That's why we had to shorten the video.</p>
      <p>"I would suggest that if people want to see the full video they can go to the official CCHQ Twitter feed."</p>
      <p>Asked if the party doctored the video, Mr Cleverly said: "We edited the video just like you edit stuff on your programme."</p>
      <p>Eventually after several interruptions he snapped: "For goodness sake Piers, let me finish!</p>
      <p>"I've now got to go to the next studio for the next interview. We've already overrun."</p>
      <p>In other news, the Tory election campaign will finally launch today when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> gives a street in Downing Street and a West Midlands rally.</p>
      <p>For the avoidance of doubt, our video in this story was edited for length.</p>
