      <p>Fired <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Disney">Disney</a> employee Steven van Soeren is suing the company, claiming it spied on him by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Hacking">hacking</a> his phone and computer and that he was the target of discrimination and harassment over his new parental status. </p>
      <p>Van Soeren worked as a product designer at BAMTech and Disney Streaming Services from August 2016 until he was fired in May 2019.</p>
      <p>According to the lawsuit, Disney terminated Van Soeren’s employment without cause and did not provide severance pay. </p>
      <p>Van Soeren alleged that while he worked for Disney Streaming Services, he was subject to “a work environment displaying a pattern and practice of discrimination and evidence of discriminatory animus” due to his partner’s pregnancy.</p>
      <p>According to the lawsuit, “numerous” colleagues “discussed and referenced matters that Plaintiff had only discussed at home with his spouse, and/or viewed through his Google Chrome internet browser” last year, leading van Soeren to conclude that Disney employees had hacked into his home computer.</p>
      <p>Van Soeren alleged that his boss, senior director of UX and design Brian McConnell, “blurted out to Plaintiff, ‘maybe you shouldn’t have a kid’” even though he had never been told about the pregnancy and that another colleague knew he had been googling whether carcinogens were in the food made at sandwich shop Subway. </p>
      <p>As well as the alleged spying, Van Soeren claims McConnell and other DSS employees “continued to harass, taunt and intimidate Plaintiff throughout his spouse’s pregnancy and the birth of his child”. </p>
      <p>McConnell allegedly verbally abused Van Soeren with comments such as “f*** you, Steve” as well as calling him the “tallest midget” and saying that “everything he said was stupid”.</p>
      <p><i>The Independent</i> has contacted Disney for comment.</p>
