      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/pharrell">Pharrell Williams</a> has spoken out against a federal jury’s ruling that his hit song “Blurred Lines” illegally copied from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MarvinGaye">Marvin Gaye</a>’s “Got to Give it Up”.</p>
      <p>In 2018, a federal appeals court upheld a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/blurred-lines-copyright-ruling-upheld-robin-thicke-pharrell-marvin-gaye-latest-a8267941.html">controversial copyright infringement verdict</a> against singer Robin Thicke and Williams over the 2013 chart-topper. They were told to pay half of the song’s royalties to Gaye’s family and make a one-off payment of $5.3m (£4m) in damages.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the long-winded legal battle, Williams told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnahkJevp64"><i>GQ</i></a>: “It hurt my feelings because I would never take anything from anyone. And that really set me back.”</p>
      <p>After producer Rick Rubin, who took part in the conversation, commented that “Blurred Lines” sounds “nothing like” Gaye’s classic, Williams replied: “Nope. But the feeling was. You can’t copyright a feeling… All salsa songs sound pretty much the same.” </p>
      <p>While it was an extremely popular song, “Blurred Lines” was met with a considerable backlash at the time of its release because of its lyrics about sex and consent.</p>
      <p>Williams recently said the public’s reaction to the track <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/pharrell-blurred-lines-backlash-sexist-metoo-feminism-culture-a9155256.html">made him realise we are “living in a chauvinist culture”</a> and said he was “embarrassed” by the attitude towards women expressed in some of his older songs.</p>
