      <p>LONDON, Nov 6 — A new track recorded by George Michael in his last studio sessions before his 2016 death was released today, in which the late British pop idol sings about social ills.</p>
      <p><i>This Is How (We Want You To Get High)</i>, his first original material since 2012, will play at the end of upcoming festive film <i>Last Christmas</i>, itself inspired by Michael’s solo tunes and hits from his Wham! days.</p>
      <p>One of the best-selling artists of all time, Michael, who rose to fame in the 1980s as part of duo Wham!, died at his home on Christmas Day 2016, aged 53. A coroner said he died of natural causes.</p>
      <p>“The previously unreleased track, which was recorded during George’s final studio sessions, is his first original material to be shared for seven years,” a press release said.</p>
      <p>“The lyrics, written exclusively by George, see the star addressing society’s ills with his trademark blend of self-deprecation and wry humour.”</p>
      <p>Against a catchy melody, Michael’s distinctive vocals belt out lines like “Your daddy was a drinker”, “My daddy was a toker”, “I will always try to get my life together” and “This is how we want you to get by on your sorry lives”.</p>
      <p>An accompanying lyric video features animation of Michael over the years.</p>
      <p>The Grammy Award-winner, who had several drug-related run-ins with the law, began working on the song in 2012. It was finalised in the studio in 2015.</p>
      <p>Born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou to Greek Cypriot immigrant parents, Michael was known for Wham! and solo hits like <i>Last Christmas</i>, <i>Careless Whisper</i> and <i>Faith</i>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Last Christmas</i> film, starring Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding about a woman working as an elf in a Christmas shop, takes its name from the 1986 Wham! festive tune.</p>
      <p>The soundtrack for the romantic comedy, co-written by Oscar winner Emma Thompson, features 12 Michael solo songs and three Wham! tunes.</p>
      <p>“Emma had a meeting with him and he was intrigued because... the intention was never to make his story, it was to make a story inspired by a song,” David Livingstone, a producer on the film, told Reuters, referring to a meeting Thompson had with Michael to discuss a screenplay.</p>
      <p>Thompson heard the new tune and three other unreleased Michael songs last year when working on the soundtrack.</p>
      <p>“It’s not like a song that’s been dug out of the vaults, that’s been sitting there unused because it wasn’t good enough. It was a song that he intended to do something with and this is its new home,” Livingstone said.</p>
      <p>“(It) does feel like it’s tailor-made.” — Reuters</p>
