      <p>Bill Turnbull is set to make his breakfast TV comeback - by replacing Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>Controversial Piers hosts the ITV1 daytime favourite each morning from Monday to Thursday.</p>
      <p>The former newspaper editor routinely makes headlines through his controversial takes, on-air rants and explosive interviews.</p>
      <p>But the Arsenal fan is set to be replaced by Bill, it has emerged.</p>

      <p>The ex-BBC Breakfast host reunited with his former co-host Susanna Reid today.</p>
      <p>Bill was asked to return to morning telly by his former co-host Susanna during an emotional interview on today's GMB.</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old presented his last episode of BBC Breakfast with Louise Minchin back in February 2016 before being diagnosed with incurable prostate cancer back in November 2017.</p>

      <p>Susanna asked: "What would you think about, on a day where Piers Morgan perhaps has been incapacitated.</p>
      <p>"Why don't you come and sit next to me and present the programme?"</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Bill confirmed he would "love" to join Susanna on the sofa again.</p>
      <p>Bill said: "I would love to. Name the day. I wouldn't do it full-time. It's a little bit stressful and stress isn't good for the cancer. But every once in a while would be great."</p>
      <p>He cheekily added: "What are you doing tomorrow?"</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Piers gave his blessing after the cheeky on-air exchange.</p>
