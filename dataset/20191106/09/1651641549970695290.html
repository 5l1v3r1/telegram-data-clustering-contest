      <p>Microsoft today released a new update for Microsoft To Do for iOS app in Apple App Store. This Version 2.4 update brings support for FaceID if you use To Do app with Mobile Device Management.</p>
      <p>Microsoft <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/latest-microsoft-to-do-for-ios-update-brings-dark-mode-support/">last month updated the To Do app</a> with dark mode support for iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 users. With the new update, Microsoft has extended the dark mode support. Dark mode is now supported in the help articles too, so you can rest your eyes while you search through our tips and tricks.</p>
      <p>Microsoft recently added URL preview in To Do. With this update, if don’t want to see a preview of a URL in your notes, you can turn it off in To Do app settings.</p>
      <p>This update also includes the following bug fixes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We fixed an issue that cropped up in iOS 13 which meant that hashtags were no longer clickable.</li>
        <li>Depending on your time zone due dates occasionally shifted by a few hours. We fixed that now.</li>
        <li>We made a whole bunch of accessibility improvements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Download the updated To-Do app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790">here from App Store.</a></p>
