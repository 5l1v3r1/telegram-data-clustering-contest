      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 6 — German sportswear maker Adidas said today it remains confident of hitting full-year financial targets after a profit slip in the third quarter, buoyed by fast-rising sales.</p>
      <p>In July-September, Adidas’ bottom line fell back 1.8 per cent year-on-year, to €646 million (RM2.9 billion), slightly beating forecasts from analysts surveyed by Factset.</p>
      <p>But revenues surged 9.1 per cent to €6.4 billion.</p>
      <p>Double-digit growth in China and North America was Adidas’ biggest sales driver, while Europe inched up more tentatively.</p>
      <p>Its flagship brand with the three stripes sold six per cent more even in a year without mammoth sporting events, while struggling US subsidiary Reebok also lifted sales slightly.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile growth in online sales slowed to 14 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 76 per cent a year before.</p>
      <p>Despite the growth, operating, or underlying profit at Adidas also fell back, shedding 0.3 per cent to reach €897 million.</p>
      <p>The operating result was weighed down by advertising costs as the company looks to rev up sales in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>“We confirm our full-year outlook and remain confident about a significant top-line acceleration during the fourth quarter,” chief executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Bavarian group expects to make net profits between €1.88 and €1.95 billion this year, up between 10 and 14 per cent on 2018’s result. — AFP</p>
