      <p>According to media reports, Rubis is planning to spend at least Ksh5 billion in the acquisition that will make it the largest oil marketer in Kenya.</p>
      <p>Rubis spent close to Ksh36 billion to acquire 97.6 percent stake at KenolKobil in a deal that was filled with turbulence, with reports of insider trading.</p>

      <p>Currently, Gulf Energy has a market share of 5.8 percent while KenolKobil, as of June, had a market share of 15.4 percent. This means that the total market share for Rubis, upon Gulf acquisition, will shift to 21.2 percent.</p>
      <p>Total is the current market leader is Total at 16.4 percent followed by Vivo Energy (Shell) at 16.2 percent, and could be dwarfed by the takeover.</p>
