      <p>Sinn Fein Councillor Antóin Watters has welcomed confirmation of extra resources to deal with the scourge of so<br/>called ‘boy racers’ in the North Louth area.   </p>
      <p>At Today’s Joint Policing Committee meeting, Cllr Watters raised the issue with Gardaí saying “we urgently need to<br/>have this issue addressed before someone is seriously hurt or killed. The number of incidents reported to me by<br/>concerned residents and citizens over the past few weeks has intensified.” </p>
      <p>The Gardaí confirmed to Cllr Watters that they planned to carry out a specific operation to tackle the ‘boy racers’ and<br/>also confirmed they would allocate extra resources to the operation. </p>
      <p>Cllr Watters also took the opportunity to raise the cross-border burglary gangs who are operating in South Armagh at<br/>present. </p>
      <p>He said: “Last night seen a packed public meeting held in the South Armagh village of Meigh where concerned<br/>residents and elected representatives alike felt the way forward was a joined-up cross-border approach. </p>
      <p>There was a clear message from that meeting was that ‘we deserve better’ and both the PSNI and the Gardaí need to have a<br/>focused effort on apprehending these people who are using the border as a ‘safe passage’.”</p>
      <p>The Gardaí confirmed to Cllr Watters that they are liaising with the PSNI on a daily basis and are aware of potential<br/>targets and are carrying out extra checkpoints in the border corridor.</p>
      <p>Cllr Watters is asking all residents in the North Louth area to report anything suspicious and to look out for each<br/>other in their neighbourhoods, especially in the rural areas and to help the Gardaí in whatever way you can to make<br/>our communities safer.   </p>
