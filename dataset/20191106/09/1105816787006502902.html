      <p><b>KHARTOUM: </b>Sudan’s first-ever satellite for conducting research in military, economic and space technology has been launched by China, the northeast African country’s ruling body said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who heads Sudan’s sovereign council, announced the launch of the satellite at a meeting of his top security officials held in Khartoum.</p>
      <p>China’s state news agency, Xinhua, reported that the satellite was launched on Sunday from north China’s Shanxi Province.</p>

      <p>“The satellite aims to develop research in space technology, acquire data as well as discover natural resources for the country’s military needs,” a statement issued by the council said.</p>
      <p>The spokesman of the ruling body Mohamed al-Fakhi Sulaiman told AFP that “in a few months the satellite would be monitored from Sudan”.</p>
      <p>“China launched the satellite as it is a partner in this project.”</p>

      <p>Sudan, which is battling an economic crisis, has been involved in a national space programme for decades covering activities such as remote sensing and geoinformatics.</p>
      <p>In 2013, the then Sudanese government of now-ousted leader Omar al-Bashir established the Institute of Space Research and Aerospace (ISRA) as part of an overall plan to develop space technologies.</p>
      <p>Bashir was ousted by the army in April following a nationwide protest movement against his rule of three decades.</p>
      <p>The protests were triggered by the economic crisis led by an acute shortage of foreign currency and high inflation.</p>
