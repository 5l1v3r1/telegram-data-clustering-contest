      <p>Jordi Alba is injured again. The left-back suffered a relapse of a hamstring injury in the game against Slavia Prague on Tuesday. It's the same injury he picked up against Borussia Dortmund earlier this season.</p>
      <p>SPORT revealed at that time he would be out for three weeks and that's how long he was sidelined for. This time, he could be out for a little longer, up to a month, due to the club being extra precautious.</p>
      <p>It's not that he was rushed back the first time, but Barça didn't perhaps ease him back as they should have done given his importance to the team. That's clear given Ernesto Valverde's use of Junior Firpo.</p>
      <p>If he is feeling good, he could return for the first time against Borussia Dortmund on Nov. 27. It's difficult to imagine him playing before then.</p>
      <p>Alba knew immediately during the Slavia game what had happened and asked to be taken off. He was so worried that he was close to tears. He feels he's not having much luck with injuries at the moment and it's limiting him reaching his best form.</p>
