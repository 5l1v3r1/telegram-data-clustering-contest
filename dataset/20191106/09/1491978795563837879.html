        <i>A first-ever conference in São Paulo will mark a high point for a theory that has thrived under the far-right President Bolsonaro</i>
      </p>
      <p>Siddhartha Chaibub’s suspicions that the Earth wasn’t really round were first aroused when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/17/study-blames-youtube-for-rise-in-number-of-flat-earthers">stumbled across a YouTube video</a> while living in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.</p>
      <p>“I was always very sceptical about things,” said the 35-year-old freelance designer, who soon dived deep into the flat Earth universe: reading, watching videos and joining a dedicated WhatsApp group.</p>
      <p>By the end of 2015, he was convinced. “The model that is imposed on us – that the Earth is spherical – is full of contradictions,” he said.</p>
      <p>Today, his YouTube channel Professor Terra Plana (Flat Earth Professor) – featuring videos such as “25 examples that prove Nasa is a fraud” and “gravity doesn’t exist” – has nearly 29,000 subscribers.</p>
      <p>Like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/27/is-the-earth-pancake-flat-among-the-flat-earthers-conspiracy-theories-fake-news">Britain</a> and the United States, Brazil is seeing a revival of flat Earth theory: 7% of the population – 11 million Brazilians – believe that the Earth is flat, according to the polling firm Datafolha. The poll noted believers were more likely to be religious or poorly educated.</p>
      <p>Last week, Chaibub and three of his flat Earth fellows got their biggest break yet when they appeared on the country’s most-watched talkshow, The Night, to promote Brazil’s first ever flat Earth convention this Saturday in São Paulo.</p>
      <p>The location of the event will only be disclosed on the day, organizers say, for security reasons. “There is a lot of prejudice,” said Chaibub</p>
      <p>Critics attribute Brazil’s most recent flat Earth craze to poor public education, copycatting from abroad and to the increase in social media use.</p>
      <p>“The internet gives a voice to these idiots,” said Fernando Lang da Silveira, a professor of physics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in southern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil">Brazil</a>.</p>
      <p>He said that like climate change denial and creationism, flat Earth theory had a base of Christian fundamentalism.</p>
      <p>In Brazil, the power and influence of the evangelical Christian church has grown significantly in recent decades: around a quarter of the population identifies as evangelical and these voters played a large part in bringing the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to power.<br/><br/>Chaibub, who says he is a Catholic, admits that part of flat Earth culture is influenced by Bible verses, but denied that the movement is religious – or political.<br/><br/>Accusations of links to the flat Earth movement have dogged Bolsonaro’s government.</p>
      <p>In January, the science minister, Marcos Pontes – South America’s first astronaut – <a href="http://www.bandnewsfm.com.br/2019/01/02/astronauta-marcos-pontes-tenho-um-no-no-estomago-quando-ouve-que-a-terra-e-plana/">said that he felt a “knot in the stomach” </a>when he heard suggestions that the Earth is flat.</p>
      <p>But just a few months later, Olavo de Carvalho – a former astrologer who is considered the intellectual guru of Bolsonaro and his inner circle – prompted <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/br/mauroalbano/terra-plana-olavo-de-carvalho">outrage and ridicule</a> when he <a href="https://twitter.com/opropriolavo/status/1133838337570217984">tweeted</a>: “I didn’t study the subject of the flat Earth. I just watched a few videos of experiments that show that aquatic surfaces are flat – and so far I haven’t found anything to refute them.”</p>
      <p>Carvalho – who has also claimed Pepsi was sweetened with aborted foetuses and that oral sex can cause cancer – dined with Bolsonaro and Steve Bannon in Washington during the Brazilian president’s state visit to the US in March.</p>

      <p>When questioned about flat Earthism, the foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/15/brazil-foreign-minister-ernesto-araujo-climate-change-marxist-plot">an Olavo disciple who believes climate change is a Marxist plot</a> – also seemed sympathetic to the movement, saying: “For me, the Earth is round. But it’s important to have this spirit of questioning,”</p>
      <p>Brazil abounds in folk legends, and has long been home to a thriving subculture of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1999/aug/14/brazil">new-age truth-seekers and UFO-spotters</a>.</p>
      <p>One of the country’s most popular authors, Paulo Coelho, claims to have had “experiences” with aliens “<a href="https://paulocoelhoblog.com/2009/05/25/ufo-s/">more than once</a>” – although he recently clarified to the BBC that he <a href="https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-49665128">knew the </a><a href="https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-49665128">Earth wasn’t flat</a>.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Gleiser, a Brazilian professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College in the United States and winner of this year’s Templeton Prize, described the resurgence of the theory as “very sad”.</p>
      <p>“We’re living in very strange times. The idea of being popular for being outrageous is coming from the leadership,” he said.</p>
