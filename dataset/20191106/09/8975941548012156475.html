      <h4>Des Moines, Iowa</h4>
      <p>Population: 208,020</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why it’s a great place for antiquers: It anchors the easternmost point of the Iowa Antiques Trail.</li>
        <li>Why it’s a great place to live: Des Moines, how do we love thee? Let us count the ways: short commutes, nationally renowned farmers markets, a booming millennial population, tons of job opportunities and a median home price of $130,000. We could go on, but those are the highlights.</li>
        <li>Best place to score an amazing deal: The DAV Thrift Store is a nonprofit secondhand store that supports disabled veterans.</li>
        <li>Best place to buy an investment piece: The Brass Armadillo Antique Mall. With more than 450 vendors and 45,000 square feet of retail space, you’re sure to find what you’re looking for. A 1930s stove for $500 or a pair of <a href="https://brassarmadillo.com/marketplace/product/pair-of-mid-century-modern-lamps-with-circle-pattern-on-a-neutral-base-and-square-lamp-shade/">mid century lamps for $150</a>?

      <ul>
        <li>Why it’s a great place for antiquers: Take advantage of all the great antiques passed on by Florida’s retirees. Micanopy is just outside of Gainesville, which is not a destination usually associated with antiques, so you won’t have much competition in your hunt.</li>
        <li>Why it’s a great place to live: Small-town charm and home prices (the official population is just 600 and the median home price is $185,000), just 18 minutes south of Gainesville. And it borders gorgeous Tuscawilla Preserve.</li>
        <li>Best place to score an amazing deal: Outreach Thrift offers lower-than-usual thrift prices in a nicer-than-usual surroundings — think boutique-y shop fronts and nicely organized racks.</li>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Why it’s a great place for antiquers: There are tons of antique stores, coupled with lots of hidden thrift store gems. Eureka Springs is a lovely destination with tons to do even if you’re not particularly into antiques (re: your good-natured-but-long-suffering partner or best friend.)</li>
        <li>Why it’s a great place to live: It’s incredibly affordable. The median home price is $176,000. Also: it’s beautiful. Nestled in the Ozarks, it’s been a vacation destination since the 1800s and has long been known for its healing waters, Victorian architecture, historical significance and as a haven for artists.</li>
        <li>Best place to score an amazing deal: The Good Shepherd Thrift Store donates its profits to the humane society and it’s filled with amazing deals — that’s a win/win. It was recently voted one of the best thrift stores in Northwest Arkansas.</li>

      <p>Population: 36,291</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Where to fuel up for a day of treasure-hunting: In their own words, The Tin Lizzie Cafe is “a cross between your grandmother’s kitchen – where you can smell the comfort food cooking – and an eclectic museum.” Try the bagel and egg sandwich or a sandwich called “Unclaimed Happiness.” </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Lawrence, Kan.</h4>
      <p>Population: 91,305</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why it’s a great place for antiquers: Lawrence is a win/win/win for antiquers — antiques are often more reasonably priced in the Midwest vs. the coasts. Antiques are usually more affordable in small cities vs. big cities. And because Lawrence is a college town and college kids are rarely interested in antiques, you won’t have much competition.</li>
        <li>Why it’s a great place to live: Lawrence offers you the best of both worlds — a college town, small city vibe that’s only 40 minutes from Kansas City (population: 500,000).</li>
        <li>Best place to score an amazing deal: The Social Service League Thrift Store is a treasure trove of affordable finds and overlooked vintage. If you’re a senior citizen, visit on a Wednesday for 60% off.</li>

        <li>Where to fuel up for a day of treasure-hunting: You haven’t visited Kansas if you haven’t eaten at local chain Big Biscuit. Be sure to order one of their signature Sticky Biscuits, an oversize biscuit loaded with raisins, cranberries, pecans and buttercream frosting.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Scottsdale, Ariz.</h4>
      <p>Population: 227,471</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why it’s a great place for antiquers: Another city favored by retirees and all the vintage furniture they no longer want. Also: Scottsdale is a high-income city which means the flea markets and thrift stores haven’t been picked over.</li>
        <li>Why it’s a great place to live: Scottsdale is regularly ranked as one of the best places to live and one of the best places to retire in the U.S. Why? There are equal opportunities to work (the city’s top employers include Honor Health, General Dynamics and a branch of the Mayo Clinic) and play — there are more than 200 golf courses and some of the hottest nightclubs in the region.</li>
        <li>Best place to score an amazing deal: White Dove Thrift Shop sells the usual thrift finds as well as the occasional high-end antique — like <a href="http://whitedovethrift.org/images/just-arrived/745.jpg">this Rosenthal Versace Medusa teapot.</a></li>
        <li>Best place to buy an investment piece: Twenty-five minutes south of Scottsdale, Vintage Joe’s is worth the drive — and it has the five-star Google ratings to prove it. Check out merchandise like a vintage guitar signed by Alice Cooper and first edition comic books.</li>
        <li>Where to fuel up for a day of treasure-hunting: Breakfast Club is an extremely beloved local haunt, with three locations spread over Scottsdale and Phoenix. Order their Huevos con Masa for a bit of Southwestern flair to start your day. </li>

      <ul>
        <li>Why it’s a great place for antiquers: Long a haven for retired folks, Daytona Beach’s antique stores and flea markets are filled with vintage finds from thousands of transplants downsizing into their new, smaller homes. And antique lovers reap the benefits.</li>
