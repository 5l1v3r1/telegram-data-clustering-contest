      <p>"The satellite aims to develop research in space technology, acquire data as well as discover natural resources for the country's military needs," a statement issued by the council said.</p>
      <p>Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported that the Sudan Remote Sensing Satellite (SRSS-1), was launched on Sunday from the northern Chinese province of Shanxi.</p>
      <p>Spokesman of the ruling body,Â Mohamed al-Faki Suleiman told AFP news agency that "in a few months the satellite would be monitored from Sudan".</p>
      <p>"China launched the satellite as it is a partner in this project," al-Faki said.</p>
      <p>Sudan, which is battling an economic crisis, has been involved in a national space programme for decades covering activities such as remote sensing and geo-informatics.</p>
      <p>In 2013, the then-Sudanese government led by President Omar al-Bashir established the Institute of Space Research and Aerospace (ISRA) as part of an overall plan to develop space technologies.</p>
      <p>Al-Bashir was removed by the army in April following a nationwide protest movement against his 30-year rule.</p>
      <p>The protests were triggered by the economic crisis led by an acute shortage of foreign currency and high inflation.</p>
