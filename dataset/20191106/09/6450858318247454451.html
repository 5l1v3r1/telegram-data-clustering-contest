      <p>Pro-AV manufacturer Ugreen is jumping the gun on Black Friday with a week of discounts on its charging products, including PD (Power Delivery) chargers and USB-C cables. These discounts are live until November 10th in the UK only.</p>

      </p>
      <p>For starters, there’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Charger-Delivery-Samsung-Nintendo/dp/B07S7NQYFS/?ascsubtag=06-3777311-11-0000000">17% discount</a> on its 18W USB-C PD Charger, down from an already reasonable £10.79 to just £8.99.</p>
      <p>Apple has traditionally been a Scrooge with the chargers it includes in the box with its iPhones. Even the latest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777311-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpc-peripheral%2F7-days-of-amazing-discounts-on-usb-c-charging-tech-up-30-3777311%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Freview%2Fiphone%2Fiphone-11-3702921%2F">iPhone 11</a> still ships with a puny 5W charger. Luckily, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777311-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpc-peripheral%2F7-days-of-amazing-discounts-on-usb-c-charging-tech-up-30-3777311%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Freview%2Fiphone%2Fiphone-11-pro-3702928%2F">iPhone 11 Pro</a> at last comes with a proper 18W charger.</p>
      <p>So if you own an iPhone 11 or model previous to this, here’s an excellent way to buy a trustworthy 18W charger to power-up your device much faster. <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MU7W2B/A/18w-usb-c-power-adapter">Apple's own 18W charger</a> costs a whopping £29.</p>

      <p>There are also a bunch of USB-C cables discounted in the promotion.</p>
      <p>You can buy a 3.3ft USB-C to Lightning cable for £10.19, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lightning-UGREEN-Certified-Braided-Compatible-Space-Grey/dp/B07NL5MR1Q/?ascsubtag=06-3777311-11-0000000">15% off the standard price</a>.</p>
      <p>There are USB-C to USB-C cables (which can handle charging at up to 60W) from 1m to 2m, at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Braided-Delivery-Compatible-MacBook-Space-Grey/dp/B07PLSDPYN/?ascsubtag=06-3777311-11-0000000">offers of up to 20% off</a>. The 1m USB-C to USB-C cable costs £5.95 (15% off) and the 2m version is 20% off at £6.39.</p>
      <p>You can also buy the same but with one of the USB-C ends at a 90-degree angle, which should reduce the potential for cable splitting. The 90-degree USB-C to USB-C cables is priced at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Delivery-Braided-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B07PLT7G3C/?ascsubtag=06-3777311-11-0000000">£6.74 for 1m length</a> and at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-Delivery-Braided-Compatible-MacBook/dp/B07PHGS5W6/?ascsubtag=06-3777311-11-0000000">£8.74 at 2m</a>.</p>

      <p>Ugreen’s biggest discount is 31% off its 4-port USB hub, although this is still USB-A only, not USB-C. It’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/UGREEN-High-Speed-Splitter-Extension-Compatible-Black/dp/B07M5LMGXZ?ascsubtag=06-3777311-11-0000000">down from £11.99 to £8.24</a>, and is a bargain if your old USB-A computer lacks all the USB ports you need.</p>
      <p>For the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/pc-peripheral/usb-c-hubs-3683402/">best USB-C hubs</a>, we have tested those adapters that work with the latest USB-C laptops.</p>
