      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> celebrities seem to be enjoying their rendezvous with the common man during their morning walks and vacays, stories of which are later shared on social media. First off it was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> who tweeted about his morning walk experience with his daughter Nitara. The actor spoke about an old couple’s random act of kindness, as they offered Akshay and his daughter the ‘most delicious gur-roti’. “Today’s morning walk turned into a life lesson for the little one. We walked into this kind, old couple’s house for a sip of water and they made us the most delicious gur-roti. Truly, being kind costs nothing but means everything,” posted Akshay.</p>

      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anushka-Sharma">Anushka Sharma</a> also spelled her experience in the hills. The actress has been holidaying with cricketer hubby <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> in Bhutan and during a trek the couple enjoyed a cup tea of team with ‘a warm family’. Describing her experience Anushka wrote, “During our 8.5 km uphill trek we stopped by a small village on a mountain to pet and feed a baby calf who was born just 4 months ago. While we did that the owner of the house asked us if we were tired and wanted to have a cup of tea? So we went in to the home of this beautiful and warm family who had absolutely no idea who we were and yet they treated us with such warmth and love. We spent some time with them chatting and drinking tea and the whole time they just know us as two tired trekkers!”. The ‘Pari’ actress added that it was indeed a ‘cherished memory’.</p>

      <p>And on Sunday it was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anupam-Kher">Anupam Kher</a> who treated his ‘morning walk friends’ to a brunch at a city hotel. The actor posted a video of the overjoyed bunch of kids and shared, “Humbling &amp; gratifying to take my morning walk friends to a hotel for brunch. We laughed, sang songs &amp; ate. Great time together. When the bill came, one of them whispered, "Uncle!! Bill zyada to nahi aaya na?" This came from a child who sleeps on the streets of Mumbai. Jai Ho”.</p>
