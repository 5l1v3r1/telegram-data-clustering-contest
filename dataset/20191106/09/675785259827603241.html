      <h1>Fortnite star Ninja claims Epic Games was 'too heavy-handed' with ban of Brit teen</h1>
      <h2>Ninja has leapt to FaZe Jarvis' defence, after the youngster was banned from Fortnite for cheating in the popular game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T09:15:12+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>He’s one of the biggest names in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-games">gaming </a>industry, and now Fortnite star Ninja has waded into the debate of whether Jarvis Kaye should have been banned from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
      <p>Jarvis, known as FaZe Jarvis, broadcast a video of him using ‘aimbots’ - a tactic that is banned on Fortnite - to his two million YouTube subscribers.</p>
      <p>Epic Games, the developer behind Fortnite, immediately banned Jarvis from the game, sparking a fierce debate of whether cheating should result in a permanent ban.</p>
      <p>Now, Ninja has leapt to Jarvis’ defence, claiming that Epic Games’ punishment was ‘too heavy-handed.’</p>

      <p>He said: “He’s still super young, so I think he’s just a stupid kid making a stupid decision, and didn’t really think about it.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t a tournament, wasn’t a Cash Cup, it should be maybe a six-month ban from competitive. Permanent though?”</p>
      <p>Jarvis has over two million subscribers on YouTube, who regularly tune in to see the youngster playing Fortnite.</p>

      <p>Ninja claims that this large following should be a reason for Epic Games not to permanently ban him.</p>
      <p>He added: “Without your content creators, there’s a negative impact on your game.</p>
      <p>“I think (what he did) was incredibly stupid, but a permanent ban is just silly. What else is he going to play?</p>
      <p>“He has to transition over from one of the most popular games, and one that’s made him skill-wise, and career-wise, and now he has to play another game.”</p>
      <p>Ninja also drew comparisons with YouTuber Logan Paul, who drew controversy last year for point g a video showing dead bodies in Japan’s ‘Suidcide Forest’.</p>
      <p>He said: “Logan Paul literally filmed someone hanging in a forest and his channel didn’t get banned and he’s been perfectly fine.</p>
      <p>“In that aspect, he was a YouTuber, a big one, and he didn’t get banned. YouTube decided that he was big enough to not get banned.”</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Epic Games for comment.</p>
