      <p>Several fire crews were attacked as they dealt with more than 350 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bonfire-night">bonfires</a> on their busiest night of the year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-fire-and-rescue-service">Scottish Fire and Rescue Service</a> (SFRS) handled 882 calls from members of the public during the late afternoon and evening of November 5.</p>
      <p>Fire crews responded to around 359 bonfires between 3.30pm and 11.30pm on Tuesday, November 5.</p>
      <p>Crews also reported being attacked six times over the course of the night but no firefighters were seriously injured.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Officer John Dickie, SFRS director of response and resilience, condemned the attacks on crews.</p>
      <p>He said: "Any number of attacks on emergency service responders is completely unacceptable.</p>
      <p>"This type of behaviour not only prevents our crews from bringing any emergency to a safe and swift conclusion but it can impact on our emergency service colleagues including the police when they have to escort us at the scene."</p>
      <p>SFRS had appealed to people to attend organised events rather than "do-it-yourself fireworks displays" or illegal bonfires.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Officer Dickie said: "Bonfire Night is our busiest night of the year by far, and indeed it tops off one of our busiest four-week periods in the year.</p>
      <p>"In addition to attending the numerous deliberate fires and bonfires, our firefighters continued to respond to the full range of emergencies we face day-to-day.</p>
      <p>"Our frontline crews and Operations Control personnel and support staff have shown extreme dedication over this period and I would like to pay tribute to their professionalism, skill and hard work which enabled them to help protect communities.</p>
      <p>"In addition, I must thank our partners and indeed communities across Scotland for their assistance and support."</p>
      <p>Firefighters dealt with an overall estimated total of 665 incidents over the course of the night.</p>
