      <h1>Best Microsoft Surface Deals November 2019</h1>
      <h2>We love Microsoft's range of Surface devices but why pay full price when you can grab one of these deals?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T09:15:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author">Somrata Sarkar</a></address>
      <p>Over the years, Microsoft has proven that it's Surface devices are not only here to stay but they are some of the best Windows devices around competing with the likes of Dell, Lenovo and HP. There's a wide range of options so you'll find a Surface that's right for your needs and we've found all the best deals and discounts available.</p>
      <p>The Surface range boasts a sleek and powerful line of touchscreen laptops, 2-in-1 tablets, and all-in-one PCs too. They pack stunning displays, speed and versatility into slick, lightweight designs, breaking the old notion of PCs as clunky business computers. On the contrary, these premium PCs are closer to Apple MacBooks and iPads and sometimes outperform them.</p>
      <p>That said, Surface devices can be expensive, reaching well into the thousands depending on the model and configuration you choose. That’s why we’ve rounded up the best Surface offers out there, along with buying advice, so you can spot the deals from the duds. This is the current range:</p>

      <h3>Best Microsoft Surface Deals 2019</h3>
      <p>Here's how much the Surface Pro 6 costs today from all of the major retailers.</p>
      <h3>Surface accessories</h3>
      <p>Keep in mind Surface Pro tablets don’t come with the Type Cover or other accessories, so you will have to buy them separately. This mounts on to the price which is why we recommend looking for bundle deals, whichever retailer you shop from. Alternatively, if you do not find a bundle, it's a good idea to check if the discount offered is significant enough to offset the price of buying accessories separately.</p>
      <p>Type Covers, the detachable keyboards for Surface tablets, will probably be the most useful accessory to buy. There are two version, so ensure the one you buy is compatible with the Surface model you have. The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-go-signature-type-cover/90KBCCPW6FSV/1R9P">Surface Go Type Cover usually retails for £99.99/$129.99</a> while the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pro-signature-type-cover/920k9q46v4bz">Surface Pro Type Cover retails at £149.99/$159.99</a>.</p>
      <p>We've also listed the RRPs for other Surface accessories below so it's easier to spot how much you're really saving. Some retailers can inflate the original price to make a discount look greater than it really is.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pen/8zl5c82qmg6b?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">Surface Pen - RRP £99.99</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/search?q=Surface+Mouse">Surface Mouse - RRPs from £29.99 to £79.99</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-dial/925r551sktgn?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">Surface Dial - RRP £89.99</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Where to find Microsoft Surface deals</h3>
      <p>With the release of the Surface Pro 6, you can expect to see deals and discounts on older Surface Pro models. The first place to check for deals is at the Microsoft store itself. For instance, you can now <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Surface-FJR-00002-12-3-Inch-PixelSense/dp/B072PSF7HR?ascsubtag=06-3684757-11-0000000">get a Surface Pro (5th gen) for £649</a>.</p>
      <p>Also check out the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/collections/microsoftsurfacedeals?cat0=devices">Surface deals page </a>where, at the time of writing, you can save over £500. When Microsoft offers deals, other retailers may also follow suit, so knowing Microsoft’s discount is a useful indicator of how much you’re actually saving. Remember to compare the specs of the model you’re buying against the price set by Microsoft for the same configuration.</p>
      <p>Retailers sometimes unfairly use images of the Surface tablets with the Type Cover as well, even though the Type Cover is not included. Ensure you double check the details before adding to cart. </p>
      <p>Of course, comparing prices against different retailers and e-retailers such as the ones below is always a good idea:</p>

      <h3>Refurbished Microsoft Surface deals</h3>
      <p>With so many models about, the year of the model on offer also affects the price. The latest version may not have the most competitive discount, while an older model with a competitive discount may not have the most advanced specs.</p>
      <p>If you’re happy with an older model of a Surface device that’s been pre-owned, you could save shopping refurbished. We would recommend that the model you buy is certified refurbished, as these are rigorously tested and backed by Microsoft to work like new. You also get a one-year hardware warranty.</p>
      <p>Refurbished deals can be found directly on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/collections/refurbishedsurface/pc">Microsoft’s site</a>. Keep checking if there's nothing in stock.</p>
      <h3>Microsoft Surface student discount</h3>
      <p>Microsoft also offers up to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/b/student">10% discounts to students, parents and teachers</a> and includes a range of devices.</p>
      <p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3684757-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Ftablets%2Fmicrosoft-surface-deals-3684757%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftech-advisor.studentbeans.com%2Fuk">Tech Advisor’s dedicated student deals site</a> is another place to get a discount on Microsoft Surface products.
