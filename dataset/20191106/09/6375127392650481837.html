      <h3>Tagudin, Ilocos Sur Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez was shot dead by still unidentified assailants late afternoon last Tuesday.</h3>
      <p>The Office of the Court Administrator disclosed that Bañez, 54, was on his way to his home in La Union when unidentified suspects shot him at close range.</p>
      <p>Bañez was rushed to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival.</p>
      <p>He was the fifth active judge killed since the start of the administration of President Duterte.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta condemned the killing of Bañez and called on law enforcement agencies to “exert their best efforts and be relentless in their investigation.”</p>
      <p>“On behalf of the Judiciary, I strongly condemn the killing of Regional Trial Court Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur. I call on the law enforcement agencies to exert their best efforts and be relentless in their investigation for the immediate apprehension of those responsible for this atrocious and dastardly act. I also extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Judge Bañez,” he said in a statement.</p>
