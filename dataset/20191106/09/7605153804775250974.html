        <b>KISUMU, Kenya, Nov 6 – Police in Kisumu have launched a manhunt for four men accused of defiling a 13-year-old girl.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The victim, a Class VII pupil, was reportedly defiled in Ofunyu village in Kisumu East sub-county on the outskirts of the lakeside city, Elija Omumbo a local Chief confirmed.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The minor was admitted at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) for treatment after the incident that occurred Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Omumbo said the minor’s mother reported the matter noting that known suspects are closely being trailed.</p>
      <p>“One of the four suspects was positively identified by the minor and that gives the police a good lead to nab all the perpetrators,” the mother who sought to remain anonymous said.</p>
      <p>The suspect, she said, is a Form IV student and candidate for the Kenya Certificate Secondary Education (KCSE) at a local secondary school in the area.</p>
      <p>The suspects forcefully took the victim away on a motorbike to a house in the area and defiled her repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Her mother said two other suspects were also involved but did not take part in the act.</p>
      <p>The mother, however, accused the police in Nyamasaria of impeding arrests even after one suspect was identified.</p>
      <p>“I had to report the matter again at Kondele Police Station where the matter is currently being probed,” she added.</p>
