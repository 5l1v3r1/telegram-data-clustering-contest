      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 6 — German carmaker BMW said today it was on track to hit performance targets for 2019 despite “difficult conditions”, after the third quarter brought rising sales and profits.</p>
      <p>BMW’s bottom line swelled 11.5 per cent to over €1.5 billion (RM6.9 billion), lifted by the comparison to 2018’s weak third quarter that was weighed down by new emissions tests.</p>
      <p>“We are performing at a high level in comparison with our competitors and considering the difficult conditions our business is facing,” chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Oliver Zipse said BMW was “well on our way to reaching our targets for the year as a whole.”</p>
      <p>But bosses’ objectives call for pre-tax profit to fall “significantly below” 2018’s level over the full year.</p>
      <p>Between January and September, the measure fell 35 per cent year-on-year.</p>
      <p>BMW’s profits met forecasts from analysts surveyed by Factset, but it was able to beat expectations on revenue — up 7.9 per cent, at €26.7 billion — and operating, or underlying profit, which gained 32.9 per cent to reach €2.3 billion.</p>
      <p>The group operating margin, closely watched by investors, increased one per centage point, while the automobile division alone added 2.2 points year-on-year.</p>
      <p>Over the full nine months, BMW’s earnings have been weighed down by €1.4 billion of provisions it had to set aside over a European Commission cartel probe.</p>
      <p>Brussels accuses BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler of secret deals not to compete on emissions reduction technologies.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the group added that its results were also lifted by cost-cutting measures, as BMW — like other carmakers — looks to foot the bill for costly investments in new technologies such as electric and autonomous driving.</p>
      <p>It aims to find €12 billion of annual savings “by the end of 2022”.</p>
      <p>One key measure will be slimming down BMW’s product line, with half its combustion-powered cars slashed in favour of electric models from 2021. — AFP</p>
