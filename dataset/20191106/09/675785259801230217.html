      <p>This past September, Vin shared a touching message to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to honour Paul on what would have been his 46th birthday as he revealed that Meadow regularly checks up on him.</p>
      <p>The legendary actor wrote: "I reflect on how lucky I am to call you my brother. The tears never go away, but they change... from that of mourning to that of grace.</p>
      <p>We only hope to make you proud. Speaking of which, guess what message I woke up to... your daughter. Meadow sending me love on this day."</p>
      <p>He added: "Wow, she knows me so well. She has your heart. Happy birthday... it’s amazing, but somehow you continue to make the world a better place."</p>

      <p>Paul Walker died in November 2013 when the Porsche Carrera GT he was riding in spun out of control, struck three trees and burst into flames on a street in California.</p>
      <p>The actor, aged 40 when he died, had starred in films including She's All That and Varsity Blues, but was best known for appearing as Brian O'Conner in The Fast And The Furious franchise.</p>
      <p>Following Paul's death his brother Cody stepped in to help finish filming of Furious 7.</p>
      <p>Producers digitally superimposed Paul's face onto Cody's body, and the movie's ending features a modified scene in which the character drives off into the sunset.</p>
      <p>His character is still alive in the Fast And The Furious universe and was mentioned twice in 2017's The Fate Of The Furious.</p>
