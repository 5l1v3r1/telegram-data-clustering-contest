      <h1>No Love for Drones as Kenya Aircraft Regulator Issues Another Warning to the Public</h1>

      <p>Unmanned flying vehicles popularly referred to as drones have been under scrutiny by regulators that appear to echo their distaste for the devices.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Kenya drone enthusiasts <a href="https://techweez.com/2016/08/24/drones-in-kenya/">started engaging regulators</a> to provide them with operating licenses. The plan was to register drones with the KCAA (Kenya Civil Aviation Authority) before receiving an RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) certificate. A few weeks later, <a href="https://techweez.com/2016/11/23/drones-in-kenya-2/">KRA confiscated more than 1000 drones</a> that were reportedly brought into the country without proper documentation.</p>
      <p>In early 2017, the state followed the footsteps of Rwanda by <a href="https://techweez.com/2017/02/14/kenya-finally-approves-drone-regulations/">approving a draft legal framework</a> for remotely piloted aircraft systems. Later on, people were given the go-ahead to apply for a drone operating license, <a href="https://techweez.com/2018/03/21/kenya-legalizes-drones/">although the requirements were quite harsh</a>, including strict operation time, height restrictions and models.</p>
      <p>In mid-2018, the development was then set back after the proposal by the KCAA named the Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems Regulations, 2017, <a href="https://techweez.com/2018/06/18/kenyan-legislators-invalidate-drone-regulations/">was shot down by MPs</a>. The lawmakers cited minimal public participation during the formulation of the regulations, privacy issues and inconsistencies in the act such as fines.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to fix some missteps, the KCAA <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/05/09/uas-draft-regulation-kcaa/">announced the staging of a participation forum</a> for public comments, views, and feedback on the proposed drone regulations. The meet was concluded in May 2019.</p>
      <p>Now, the KCAA is reminding the public again that flying drones is illegal. The announcement was distributed in the dailies.</p>
      <p>“The public is hereby reminded of this prohibition that shall apply to any person who imports tests, operates, procures, assembles, manufactures, or maintains a Remotely Piloted Aircraft in Kenya wherever they may be and operation in Kenya,” reads a statement from KCAA.</p>
      <p>As mentioned, the KCAA has been amending the annulled regulations. At the moment, the edited proposal is awaiting prerequisite approval.</p>
      <p>By the way, you are liable to a prison sentence of up to 12 months, or a fine of hundreds of thousands of shillings or both if KCAA nabs you being creative with drones.</p>
