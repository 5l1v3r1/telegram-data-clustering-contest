      <p>Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Mohammed bin Saeed Al Jaber hailed on Tuesday the signing of the Riyadh agreement between the legitimate government and Southern Transitional Council (STC), saying it is an opportunity to achieve a political solution in the war-torn country.<br/><br/>In remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat, he said that agreement underscores that the “solution to the crisis is possible through honest and serious dialogue.”<br/><br/>The dialogue must be serious about ending the war and the use of force to reach political goals, he added.<br/><br/>“Saudi Arabia is the main and honest backer of the political solution,” he stressed. “The opportunity is ripe to reach a political solution.”<br/><br/>Jaber hailed Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz and the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, in making dialogue possible between the Yemeni parties.<br/><br/>This culminated in the Riyadh agreement, which “would pave the way for a new phase of security, stability and development in Yemen,” he continued.<br/><br/>The agreement is another achievement by Saudi Arabia in line with its political efforts to resolve the crises in Yemen, he noted. He cited the Kingdom’s support for the Gulf initiative and comprehensive national dialogue.<br/><br/>The Riyadh agreement will allow the legitimate government to bring all of its members to the interim capital, Aden, allowing it to fulfill its commitments and duties towards the people and state, Jaber went on to say.<br/><br/>The Yemeni people have great trust in their country’s leadership and they have great respect to Saudi Arabia, he added.<br/><br/>Dialogue and diplomacy are the best ways backed by the Kingdom to resolve any disputes between brothers, said the envoy.<br/><br/>King Salman sponsored the signing ceremony that took place in the Saudi capital on Tuesday. The ceremony was attended by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and STC chief Aidarous al-Zubaidi and several senior officials.<br/><br/>Jaber hailed Hadi and the STC leaderships for meeting the calls for dialogue and agreeing on reaching a peaceful solution to their differences.</p>
