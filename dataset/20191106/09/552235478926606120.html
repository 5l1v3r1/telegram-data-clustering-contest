      <p>A Larkhall teen was delighted to represent her town in a national competition.</p>
      <p>Nicole Baird headed to Blackpool last month to compete in the final of Miss Junior Teen Great Britain.</p>
      <p>The 13-year-old was at the seaside town’s The Globe to compete against other youngsters for the title.</p>
      <p>Miss Junior Teen Great Britain do not hold beauty contests, instead it is a competition celebrating teenagers, their achievements and their goals.</p>
      <p>It is about empowering teens, having fun, making friends and incredible memories.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the competition said: “We intend for the girls to make new friends and aim to make each and every contestant feel like a queen.</p>
      <p>“Most importantly, we open the doors to fun and exciting, confidence-building opportunities for our finalists and winners.</p>
      <p>“The Miss Teen Great Britain pageant empowers our finalists and teaches them to recognise their successes, and to celebrate them.”</p>
      <p>Despite not winning, Nicole had an amazing time.</p>
      <p>Her mum Angela explained: “She represented Larkhall with pride and, despite not winning, she loved the whole experience.</p>
      <p>“She made friends and to be picked from thousands to reach the top 42 girls in Great Britain, in our eyes she is a winner.</p>
      <p>“We are so proud of her achievements and would like to say thanks to everyone who has supported her.</p>
      <p>“These include Larkhall Councillor Jackie Burns, Lesley Rundell from Larkhall Post Office and Harry Boyd of Fernaigair Church.</p>
      <p>“We would like to thank her sponsor too, R&amp;L Roofing and L’Perfection in Larkhall, who did her hair, and we would like to thank her high school, Larkhall Academy, who also supported her.”</p>
