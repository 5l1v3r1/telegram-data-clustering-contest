      <h1>Rick and Morty season 4 release date, episodes, and character news</h1>
      <h2>Here's all you need to know about season 4 of Rick and Morty, including the UK release date, teaser, images, and more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:30:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Painter</a></address>
      <p>Following an agonising wait for fans, <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-adult-swim-uk-3701403/">Adult Swim</a> officially renewed Rick and Morty back in May 2018, promising not only a fourth series but an incredible 70 episodes, spanning several seasons. Though the animated series has always had a cult following, it was season 3 that catapulted Rick and Morty into the mainstream, and it’s not hard to see why.</p>
      <p>Here’s all you need to know about Rick and Morty season 4, from the possible release date to episode information, returning cast members and the latest teasers.</p>
      <h3>When will Rick and Morty Season 4 be released?</h3>
      <p>Rick and Morty will be back on screens - in the US at least - from <b>10 November 2019.</b></p>
      <p>The bad news is that when it comes back it will only be for a scant five episodes. "Half the season you deserve, but all the season we can handle," as the season 4 trailer (below) puts it.</p>
      <p>The good news is that Adult Swim renewed Rick and Morty not only for season 4, but for a whopping 70 episodes across several seasons, so there's a lot more to come.</p>
      <p>When the show does return to the UK it will have a new home: the show is moving to Channel 4, with the first three seasons available on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-all-4-abroad-3684837/">All4</a>, and season 4 due on the channel when it eventually comes out, with repeats on E4.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, accordingly to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685380-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Frick-and-morty-3685380%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.movies.yahoo.com%2Frick-and-morty-channel-4-uk-141525771.html%3Fguccounter%3D1">Yahoo News</a> this won't be coming until <b>January 2020</b>, so UK fans will still have to hang on to get those new episodes. </p>
      <h3>Watch the trailers</h3>
      <p>We've had a couple glimpses of footage from the new season so far. The first was a typically odd release date teaser:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Then we got a full trailer for season four just a month before the premiere date:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We've also seen the release of a handful of mini-episodes appearing on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685380-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Frick-and-morty-3685380%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fadultswim">Adult Swim YouTube channel</a> following the end of season 3.</p>
      <h3>Season 4 images</h3>
      <p>We also have a couple images from the upcoming season, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685380-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Frick-and-morty-3685380%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fcomic-con%2F2019%2F07%2F16%2Frick-and-morty-photos-season-4%2F">released to Entertainment Weekly</a> ahead of the show's San Diego Comic-Con panel. The first shows Rick wandering through an alien planet of wheat, though fortunately it looks more Gladiator than Theresa May.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile the second is classic Rick and Morty: an angry Rick, some angrier robot crocodiles, and a dead (?) robot on the floor.</p>

      <h3>How many episodes will Rick and Morty season 4 feature?</h3>
      <p>Despite the first season packing in 11 episodes, season two and three of Rick and Morty have both featured 10 episodes, suggesting that’ll be the format going forward.</p>
      <p>With season four dropping five episodes in November, it seems likely that there's another five to come - probably early next year - that will round it out to ten.</p>
      <p>However, co-creator Dan Harmon discussed the idea of longer seasons during an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685380-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Frick-and-morty-3685380%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Ftv%2F2017%2F09%2F26%2Frick-morty-dan-harmon-interview%2F">interview with EW</a> that leads us to believe otherwise.</p>
      <p>“<i>I would like to think I’ve learned enough from my mistakes in season three that we could definitely do 14 now, but then I have to say, ‘Yeah but you’re the guy who says we can do 14 who turned out to be wrong so we’re not listening to you now’,</i>” Harmon remarked.</p>
      <p>“<i>The nice healthy way to approach this is I want to prove it with the first 10 of season four – prove it to ourselves, to production, to the network – that it’s so easy that we’ll earn additional episodes.</i>”</p>
      <p>So, from that, we expect season 4 of Rick and Morty to feature 10 episodes, but we’re hopeful that Harman can achieve the dream of a 14-episode season. We’d appreciate an extra four episodes of classic Rick and Morty action, that’s for sure!</p>
      <h3>Rick and Morty season 4 cast</h3>
      <p>We imagine that the original cast will return for season 4, with Justin Roiland voicing both Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith and Chris Parnell taking on the role of Morty’s father, Jerry. Spencer Grammer is tipped to be back as Morty’s sister Summer and, of course, it wouldn’t be complete without Sarah Chalke voicing Rick’s daughter, Beth.</p>
      <p>We also expect a handful of celebrity guest appearances as there were in season 3. The last season saw cameos from the likes of Nathan Fillion, Susan Sarandon, Tony Hale and more, and given the heightened interest from season two to three, we could be seeing more impressive cameos in the upcoming season.</p>
