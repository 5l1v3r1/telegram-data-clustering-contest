      <p>More than eight years after she published her breakout novel, author of <i>The Night Circus</i> has returned with an all-new book. You can <a href="https://www.booksontape.com/1-libraryreads-pick-the-starless-sea-by-erin-morgenstern-is-a-full-cast-audiobook/">start listening to Erin Morgenstern's <i>The Starless Sea</i> audiobook</a> right now, exclusively on Bustle.</p>
      <p>Published on Nov. 5, <i>The Starless Sea</i> follows Zachary, a university student who finds a book containing a true story from his childhood. Investigating how his life came to be chronicled in such a way, Zachary finds himself slipping into a previously unseen world of myths and fairy tales, where he finds two new friends — the pink-haired Mirabel and the handsome Dorian. <i>The Starless Sea</i> is a fantastical journey through a world made of legends, which <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/erin-morgenstern-didnt-have-internet-for-2-years-while-she-wrote-the-starless-sea-19285924">Morgenstern spent two years disconnected from the internet</a> to write. Writing the novel — considering the success of her first book, a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller with a dedicated fan base — was no easy feat.</p>
      <p>“You have something very large to live up to,"<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/erin-morgenstern-didnt-have-internet-for-2-years-while-she-wrote-the-starless-sea-19285924"> she told Bustle in an interview</a> published this week. "I had to try to forget that as much as I could."</p>
      <p>The audiobook version of <i>The Starless Sea</i> features a full voice cast that includes Dominic Hoffman (<i>Grey's Anatomy</i>), Dion Graham (<i>The Wire</i>), Bahni Turpin (<i>O.G.</i>), Fiona Hardingham (<i>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</i>), Allan Corduner (<i>Homeland</i>), and Jorjeana Marie (<i>Listen to Grandpa, Andy Ling</i>). You can start listening to Erin Morgenstern's new audiobook today, exclusively on Bustle.</p>
