      <h1>Rangers squad revealed as Scott Arfield looks for recall in Porto clash</h1>
      <h2>Steven Gerrard's men host the Portuguese giants at Ibrox on Thursday night hoping to take a huge step towards qualifying for the last 32.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:02:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>Rangers have a clean bill of health for their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> clash against Porto at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox side take on their Portuguese rivals on Thursday night with a fully fit European squad to pick from.</p>
      <p>Injured winger <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jordan-jones">Jordan Jones</a> isn't included in the 22-man squad while the likes of Greg Docherty and Jamie Murphy also aren't named.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-arfield">Scott Arfield</a> will be hoping for a recall to the starting lineup after being benched for Sunday's Betfred Cup win over Hearts.</p>
      <p>Greg Stewart missed out completely and will hope to be involved but Steven Gerrard is unlikely to make many changes to his side.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and Porto are tied on four points apiece in Group G, with Young Boys top on six points and Feyenoord bottom on three.</p>
