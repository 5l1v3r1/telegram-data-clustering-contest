      <p>The anticipated launch of Disney+ is less than a week away and while there are some <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482217/30-major-disney-movies-that-wont-be-on-disney-day-one">major Disney movies</a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2483930/22-major-disney-tv-shows-that-wont-be-on-disney-day-1">TV shows</a> that fans will have to wait for, the service will have plenty of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482952/6-bizarre-movies-disney-will-have-on-day-one">old</a> and new content to watch right away. The launch lineup just got a whole more stacked though because Disney+ just moved up the release of this year’s <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, the biggest movie of all time, to day one. Check it out:</p>

      <p>That’s right, you can watch <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2470714/avengers-endgame-review"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> over and over to your heart's content through Disney+ starting next Tuesday, November 12. That is if you live in the US, Canada or the Netherlands of course. Subscribers in Australia and New Zealand will have to wait an extra week until November 19. Either way, that's earlier than Disney+ subscribers were expecting to be able to watch the climactic chapter in Marvel Studios’ Infinity Saga.</p>
      <p>Back when <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> was still in theaters, before it surpassed <i>Avatar</i> and before it released on Blu-ray, it was announced that The Russo Brothers’ film would not arrive on Disney+ <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471495/avengers-endgame-already-has-a-disney-release-date?pv=search">until December 11</a>. That’s not necessarily an inordinate amount of time to wait, after all, the Blu-ray is available and this is the kind of movie worthy of a purchase.</p>
      <p>But as you can see in the video above, fans were itching to have <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> available at launch. So in response to the fan demand, and as an obvious final push before launch, Mickey Mouse used the Infinity Stones, of which he surely has many, to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483270/one-version-of-avengers-endgame-let-another-avenger-survive-the-snap">snap his fingers</a> and make it happen. Disney+ will be streaming <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> on day one, nearly a month earlier than was initially intended.</p>
      <p>Disney and its shareholders want to hit the ground running and the more subscribers the service has right away, the rosier the outlook is for the future. Assembling as much quality content as possible to present to consumers at launch bolsters the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2483091/disney-will-cost-more-than-apple-tv-but-bob-iger-has-thoughts">value proposition</a> of Disney+ and might compel someone who was thinking about waiting a while until the library grows to pull the trigger.</p>
      <p>And while there will be plenty of catalog content as well as new movies and TV shows like <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2483675/Lady-And-The-Tramp-Review-A-Disney-Doggie-Rom-Com"><i>Lady and the Tramp</i></a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2483720/the-mandalorian-the-6-biggest-facts-we-learned-from-the-trailers-so-far"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, Disney+ will actually be pretty weak as far as MCU offerings go on day one. Due to existing licensing deals many MCU movies, including most of the Phase 1 titles, will not be on Disney+ right away. So having the biggest MCU movie on the service out the gate helps mitigate that weakness.</p>
      <p><i>Avengers: Endgame</i> isn’t the only thing that will be on Disney+ on day one, the <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1190313014236348417">Disney+ Twitter account</a> also recently announced that the former box office king James Cameron’s <i>Avatar</i> will also start streaming in all territories on November 12.</p>
