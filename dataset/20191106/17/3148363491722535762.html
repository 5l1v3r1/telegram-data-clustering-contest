      <h1>Breitbart Launches 'B Inspired News' on Instagram</h1>
      <h2>The left believes in a different America.  That’s what they’re selling, and the only way to sell something different is to point out the flaws in what currently exists. That’s what the left does. It has to. It has to object to the fundamental character of America in order to justify its desire to change it.</h2>
