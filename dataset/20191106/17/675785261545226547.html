      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> will not star in this year's series of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> despite recent reports suggesting he was in the line-up.</p>
      <p>The legendary boxer, 31, was previously thought to appear in this year's celebrity jungle line-up but the claims have now been ruled out as he is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/breaking-tyson-fury-return-wwe-20824789">set to return to WWE this Friday</a> .</p>
      <p>The Gypsy King made his official WWE debut at the Crown Jewel event against Braun Strowman in Saudi Arabia last week and is now returning to the wrestling organisation.</p>
      <p>Fury signed up to WWE last month as he continues to promote his rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> next February.</p>
      <p>"I've got a big fella called <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> to see to on February 22 and we'll go from there," he recently said.</p>

      <p>Reports of Tyson's continuing WWE success come after the 6’9 heavyweight champ’s odds of entering the celebrity jungle plummeted from 20/1 down to 7/2 in the past 24 hours.</p>
      <p>After his spell in the WWE and the launch of his new book, reports suggested that I'm A Celeb bosses were keen to get the unbeaten boxer into camp in the Australian Outback.</p>
      <p>Rumours speculated that his younger brother, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tommy-fury">Tommy Fury's</a> recent stint in popular ITV2 dating show <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> was how the Furys quickly established themselves as household names.</p>
