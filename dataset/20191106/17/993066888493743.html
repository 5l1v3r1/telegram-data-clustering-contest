      <p>CARL Frampton's multi-million pound courtroom showdown with ex-manager Barry McGuigan will be heard in January, a judge confirmed today.</p>
      <p>The former word champion boxer's lawsuit centres on allegedly withheld earnings from up to seven fights.</p>
      <p>Proceedings at the High Court in Belfast have been hit by a number of delays.</p>
      <p>But following a review hearing Mr Justice Colton told lawyers he would set a date for January 20.</p>
      <p>He also directed Mr Frampton's representatives to set out and quantify the scale of damages being claimed.</p>
      <p>The development comes ahead of the Belfast boxer's return to the ring later this month in Las Vegas, where he is due to take on Tyler McCreary in a super-featherweight bout.</p>
      <p>Mr Frampton (32) is suing Mr McGuigan, his wife Sandra McGuigan and Cyclone Promotions (UK) Ltd, claiming a failure to pay purse money from his bouts.</p>
      <p>His case involves alleged earnings in excess of Â£4 million, the court was previously told.</p>
      <p>The writs form the basis of a counter-claim to separate proceedings brought against Mr Frampton in London by the McGuigan family-run Cyclone Promotions.</p>
      <p>The former two-weight world champion from the Tigers Bay area of north Belfast split with Cyclone in 2017.</p>
      <p>He is facing an action from his former promoters for alleged breach of contract.</p>
      <p>Mr Frampton is counter-suing on a number of grounds, including an alleged appropriation of fight earnings and a breach of the terms of an International Promotional Agreement (IPA).</p>
      <p>His lawsuit refers to contracts for fights in Northern Ireland, England and the United States during an association stretching back to 2012.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the McGuigans have stressed all of the allegations are categorically denied.</p>
