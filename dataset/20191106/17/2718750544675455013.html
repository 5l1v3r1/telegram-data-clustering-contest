      <p>To quote a very wise woman: <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/08/whoopi-goldberg-is-done-with-marriage.html?mid=twitter_cut">I don’t want somebody in my house</a>. But that doesn’t stop the central couple in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/m-night-shyamalan-in-conversation.html">M. Night Shyamalan’s</a> new psychological thriller for Apple TV, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/m-night-shyamalans-servant-gets-release-date-on-apple-tv.html"><i>Servant</i></a><i>, </i>from doing just that anyway. Starring Lauren Ambrose and Toby Kebbell as mourning Philadelphia parents who try to move on with their lives after the unexpected loss of their infant son, they hire a “servant” (more like a housekeeper-slash-nanny) to care for, TWIST,<i> </i>a doll that’s essentially Child 2.0. “She took it hard,” the husband explains. “This is the only thing that brought her back.” Too bad their live-in servant (Nell Tiger Free) starts getting <i>really </i>into her job and creeps the hell out of everybody in the house. The ten-episode series will debut on November 28.</p>
