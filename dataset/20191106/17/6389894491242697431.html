      <p>The Chinese company which has reemerged as a frontrunner to buy British Steel is thought to have lofty ambitions the country’s second-biggest steelmaker.</p>
      <p>Jingye Group, which is hoping to strike a deal for the manufacturer by the middle of this month, is chaired by businessman Li Ganpo, one of the richest men in China.</p>

      <p>Ganpo and a group executives arrived in the North of England last week for a tour of the company’s flagship Scunthorpe plant and its factory on Teesside.</p>
      <p>Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin, whose constituency houses British Steel’s biggest plant, said members of the delegation from Jingye Group were “very keen” in doing a deal.</p>
      <p>“He [Li Ganpo] has quite an ambitious desire for the steelworks,” he added.</p>
      <p>British Steel employs around 5,000 people in the UK, and supports about 20,000 further jobs in the supply chain. It is one of Network Rail’s main suppliers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cityam.com/chinese-steel-maker-jingye-in-new-bid-for-british-steel/">Jingye reentered the fray as a bidder</a> for the company when negotiations with Ataer Holding, an investment arm of the Turkish military’s pension fund, did not come to fruition during a period of exclusivity with the Official Receiver, which is managing the negotiations.</p>
      <p>Ataer is still “an interested and active bidder,” Dakin told <i>City A.M.</i>, but Jingye’s overtures to buy the manufacturer are thought to be more attractive to the Official Receiver.</p>
      <p>Gill Furniss, Labour’s shadow steel minister, said: “At this moment in time the workforce needs some reassurance.”</p>
      <p>She blamed the government for not closing the deal with Ataer while the exclusivity agreement was still in place. “I’m disappointed the government hasn’t done its bit.”</p>

      <p>Other bidders are thought to include Liberty Steel, which is owned by Indian businessman Sanjeev Gupta.</p>
      <p>However, the Chinese firm is hoping to reach an agreement with the Official Receiver by 10 November, according to the Financial Times.</p>
      <p>The Official Receiver and Jingye Group were not available for comment.</p>
