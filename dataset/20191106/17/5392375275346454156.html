      <h3>Vivo Y5s specifications</h3>
      <p>Knowing this fact, there aren’t any differences. The Vivo Y5s bears the same 6.53″ FHD+ display with a teardrop notch atop housing the 16MP selfie snapper.

      <p>Vivo’s romance with MediaTek continues with the Vivo Y5s since it sports the Helio P65 chipset. The horsepower is coupled with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of Internal Storage.  Software side, the handset runs Android 9 Pie-based FunTouch OS 9.2 straight out the box. If you’re familiarized with Vivo’s traditional skin, then you know that Game Cube, Multi Turbo, and AI-based digital assistant Jovi are making a comeback. Last but not least, the device draws power from a generous 5,000mAh battery with 18W fast-charging.</p>
