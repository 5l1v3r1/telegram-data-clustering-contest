      <p>A second man has admitted trying to rob Arsenal stars Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Ozil of their 200,000-British-pound ($260,000) watches in a moped ambush.</p>
      <p>Jordan Northover, 26, pleaded guilty to attempting to steal the high-value items from the Premier League footballers in Platts Lane, Hampstead, north-west London, on July 25, Harrow Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>New CCTV released by Scotland Yard shows Kolasinac standing beside his close friend Ozil's gold-trimmed black Mercedes G class 4x4 before the two attackers pull up.</p>
      <p>Despite being threatened with what appears to be a knife, the burly Bosnian defender, 26, remains unfazed.</p>
      <p>The full-back, nicknamed The Tank, then chases off the pair, who were disguised by helmets and dark clothing.</p>
      <p>The club's 350,000 pound-a-week ($450,000) German midfielder Ozil, 31, remains in his vehicle with his wife Amine before speeding off and taking refuge in a Turkish restaurant after being pursued by the raiders.</p>
      <p>Police said a key breakthrough came when a moped without number plates was spotted by a concerned member of the public in a cul-de-sac in Borehamwood, south Hertfordshire.</p>
      <p>Inquiries revealed it was the same bike used in the raid, said the Metropolitan Police.</p>
      <p>CCTV from a local pub showed Northover and Ashley Smith visiting a short time after the offence, with their clothes and a motorcycle helmet found on grassland near the bar.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Jim Corbett, of Scotland Yard's Operation Venice, said: "Northover and Smith attempted this brazen robbery after travelling around streets nearby, looking for people to rob.</p>
      <p>"Northover didn't hesitate to draw a weapon when making demands, but he didn't bargain on being challenged and the pair went away empty-handed.</p>
      <p>"This case demonstrates how important community information can be."</p>
      <p>At a previous hearing at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court, the value of one of the watches was given as 200,000 pounds.</p>
      <p>Following the ordeal, World Cup winner Ozil told the Athletic sports site that he was scared for his wife as the attackers pursued his car.</p>
      <p>He said: "They told him directly 'Give us your watch!'</p>
      <p>"Sead's reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers.</p>
      <p>"We were newlywed and I was scared about my wife. I was scared about Sead.</p>
      <p>"I saw one chance to drive. If they got to my wife, something terrible might have happened to her.</p>
      <p>"I started driving but they followed. I was driving very fast but they kept coming close on the moped.</p>
      <p>"I tried to move the car, block them, escape, but each time they would be there.</p>
      <p>"My wife was extremely scared."</p>
      <p>Ashley Smith, 30, has already admitted his role in the attempted raid.</p>
      <p>Smith, of Archway, north London, will be sentenced at Harrow Crown Court on Friday, judge Rosa Dean said.</p>
      <p>Northover will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
