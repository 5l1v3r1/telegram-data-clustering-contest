      <h1>Tesla to unveil truck inspired by 'Blade Runner' Nov. 21</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:10:05+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Trudell</a></address>
      <p>Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk set a date for the debut of the electric-car maker’s first pickup and further tied the truck to the famous sci-fi movie that inspired its design.</p>
      <p>Tesla will unveil the truck Nov. 21 in Los Angeles, near the factory where Musk’s other company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., builds rockets, Musk tweeted Wednesday. In a follow-up post, he said the date was “strangely familiar” and shared a link to the opening credits and scene of the 1982 film <i>Blade Runner</i>, which was set in November 2019.</p>

      <p>Musk, 48, has made reference to the movie before in discussing the truck. He told Recode a year ago he wanted Tesla to design “a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, <i>Blade Runner</i> pickup truck.” He released a teaser image of the truck in March.</p>
      <p>“I think the Tesla Cybertruck is our best product ever,” Musk said during Tesla’s latest earnings call on Oct. 23.</p>
