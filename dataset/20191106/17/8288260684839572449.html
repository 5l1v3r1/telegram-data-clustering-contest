      <h1>David Walliams rules out Strictly appearance for six-word reason</h1>
      <h2>The comic struggled to learn a routine to one of rapper MC Hammer's songs for his forthcoming Sky One and Now TV comedy Cinderella: After Ever After, which also stars Sian Gibson</h2>

      <p>David Walliams has ruled himself out of ever appearing Strictly Come Dancing, saying he is "one of the world's worst dancers".</p>
      <p>The Little Britain star, 48, who has previously claimed he wanted to be part of the show's first same-sex couple, said he recently discovered he was "so hopeless" on the dance floor.</p>
      <p>The comic struggled to learn a routine to one of rapper MC Hammer's songs for his forthcoming Sky One and Now TV comedy Cinderella: After Ever After, which also stars Sian Gibson.</p>
      <p>He said: "I realised I am one of the world's worst dancers.</p>
      <p>"I had a choreographer who helped me and she said: 'There are only two people who are worse dancers than you. That's Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth.'</p>

      <p>"That's not bad company actually.</p>
      <p>"People always say: 'When are you going to do Strictly?'</p>
      <p>"I found out the answer is never. I am so hopeless at dancing. It took me so long to even get to that, which is pretty pathetic."</p>
      <p>Walliams hoped the dance would riff on the recent trend of flash mobs, a kind of spontaneous group dance, at weddings.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: "It was just supposed to be a spoof on... you know when you go to wedding and people do that little routine. It was meant to be a spoof on that.</p>
      <p>"But my goodness me. We wrote it in and you go: 'Oh they dance to MC Hammer.'</p>
      <p>"It's very easy to write that as a stage direction...</p>
      <p>"(But) weeks and months of dance lessons and still no idea how to do it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"And in those costumes as well... It was quite hot. We were there in June. It was hot."</p>
      <p>The hour-long special will explore what happened to the princess following the events of the famous folk tale, memorably retold by Disney.</p>
      <p>Cinderella: After Ever After, which also stars Sir Tom Courtenay and Celia Imrie, will air over the Christmas period.</p>
