      <p>Denueve's family said in a statement released Wednesday that the 76-year-old actress suffered a "very limited and therefore reversible" stroke. The statement, by the actress' representative, Artmedia, says "fortunately, she has no motor deficits (but) must, of course, take some time to rest."</p>
      <p>Deneuve was hospitalized in Paris but the family did not disclose the name of the facility.</p>
      <p>Deneuve has been filming "De son vivant" directed by Emmanuelle Bercot.</p>
