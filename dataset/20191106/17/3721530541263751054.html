      <p>Indie mobile game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/16/17688840/holedown-ios-android-brick-breaker-grapefrukt-games"><i>Holedown</i></a>, the highly addictive and very cute planetary digging game, is coming to Nintendo Switch, developer Grapefrukt Games announced today. The Switch version will come with an exclusive new feature: two-player local cooperative play.</p>
      <p>If you’ve never played <i>Holedown</i>, the Android and iOS game has you shoot happy little smiling balls at blocks in an attempt to burrow deeper and deeper into a planet’s core. <i>Holedown</i> is relatively simple — simply drag and aim your machine-gun fire of cheerful ball friends at strategic angles and watch the bouncy destruction unfold — but strangely compelling as you aim for higher scores and deeper depths. There’s a bit of a progression system, but the fun lies in maximizing your score once you reach the planet that allows for endless play. It’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mobile/2018/9/14/17852176/best-android-iphone-games">quite good</a> (and was nominated for a Game Developers Choice Award this year).</p>

      <p>The two-player version will let each player control their own little worm buddy, doubling up on the block-smashing with color-coded balls.</p>
      <p><i>Holedown</i> will be released Nov. 13 through the Nintendo Switch eShop. The console version will cost $9.99. The Android and iOS versions cost $3.99.</p>
