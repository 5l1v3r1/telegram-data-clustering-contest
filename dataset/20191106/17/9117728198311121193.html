        <b>Racing Point have been given the go ahead to build their new factory after planning permission was granted for the team to start construction, with the factory expected to be completed in 2021. Racing Point are currently sixth in the constructors' standings, but with a gap of 18 points to fifth placed Renault, they will be understandably looking to fight off Toro Rosso in the remaining two races.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The team formerly known as Force India will be hoping to return to the level of 2016 and 2017, when they managed P4 in the constructors' standings on a very small budget, exceeding all expectations.</p>

      <p>The new factory will be next to their current one at their Silverstone base. Team boss Otmar Szafnauer told motorsport.com: <i>"I’m really happy that we were able to get planning permission in the timeframe that we wanted.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Now it’s time to just finalise some details and do the groundbreaking in the first quarter of next year. What we want to try to do if possible is move in during the summer break in 2021.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"If we’re growing the team, the current place is not big enough. We’re going to increase the team size by another 10-20%, and to do that you need space."</i>
