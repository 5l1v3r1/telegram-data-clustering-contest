      <p>An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday ordered that a 54-year-old pastor, Abayomi Oladele, accused of raping his neighbour’s two daughters, be remanded in a correctional centre, pending legal advice.</p>
      <p>Chief Magistrate B.O. Osunsemi, who did not take the plea of the defendant, ordered that he be remanded at the Kirikiri Correctional Facility, Apapa, Lagos.</p>
      <p>Mr Osunsemi ordered the police to duplicate the case file to the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions, and adjourned the case until December 31.</p>
      <p>Mr Oladele, who resides in Ifako–Ijaiye in Lagos, is charged with defilement.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the police prosecutor, Ezekiel Ayorinde, alleged that the suspect raped his neighbour’s daughters, aged eight and 14, in his room.</p>
      <p>Mr Ayorinde told the court that the defendant committed the offence in August between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. at his residence.</p>
      <p>Mr Ayorinde alleged that the defendant lured the two sisters into his room and raped them.</p>
      <p>He submitted that the girls’ mother reported the case at the police station and the defendant was apprehended.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria reports that the offence contravenes Section 137 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015, (Revised) and stipulates life imprisonment on conviction. (NAN)</p>
