      <h1>Black Friday and Cyber Monday Deals Kick in on Skyroam X WiFi Smartspot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:30:56+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>This Black Friday, you can pick up a Skyroam WiFi smartspof for 30 per cent off.</p>
      <p>The offer kicks in from November 26, with 30 per cent off the <a href="https://www.skyroam.com/uk/solis-x-wifi-smartspot">Skyroam Solis X Travel Bundle</a> that includes a travel case, multi-connector cord, and a five day pass card for £179.90. The Solix X usually costs that on its own, so if you're a frequent traveller, you might want to give it a look when it goes live in a couple weeks. That price will hold through Cyber Monday, until December 3.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can pick up the <a href="https://www.skyroam.com/uk/solis-lite">Solis Lite Travel Bundle</a> for 35 per cent off during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. For £119.90 you'll get the hotspot, the Skyroam power bank kit (with power converter and a multi-connector cord to enable power charging of various Android, i-Product and micro USB devices), and a five daypass card.</p>
      <p>For an added bonus on Cyber Monday, when you buy 10 day passes, 1-month unlimited subscription, or 12 months of GoData, you'll get a Skyroam Solis 4G LTE Hotspot and Power bank for free.</p>
