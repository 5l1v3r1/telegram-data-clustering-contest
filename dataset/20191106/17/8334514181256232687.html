      <p>A senior official of the Trump administration said a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a long-awaited interim trade deal could be delayed until December, as discussions continue over terms and a venue.</p>
      <p>Stocks were mostly flat before the report, pausing after their recent run to record highs.</p>
      <p>The year end is typically a bullish time for stocks, but the trade war is still a risk, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Also, “there’s been concern the market was moving toward overbought conditions,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.DJI">.DJI</a> fell 36.34 points, or 0.13%, to 27,456.29, the S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX">.SPX</a> lost 3.93 points, or 0.13%, to 3,070.69 and the Nasdaq Composite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.IXIC">.IXIC</a> dropped 39.58 points, or 0.47%, to 8,395.10.</p>
      <p>The recent rally had been fueled by signs of progress in trade talks between the United States and China and a mostly upbeat earnings season.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 energy index .SPNY fell 1.9% following declines in oil prices, while the S&amp;P tech index .SPLRCT was down 0.2%.</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.78-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 48 new lows.</p>
