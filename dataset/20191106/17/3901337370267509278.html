      </p>
      <p>After just one win in the opening eight league games, the Citizens announced on Sunday night that McCarthy's contract had been terminated.</p>
      <p>Assistant coach Vasili Manousakis will take charge of the first team while the club prepare to bring in their new head coach.</p>
      <p>McCarthy's last match in charge ended in a 1-0 defeat to Maritzburg United at the Cape Town Stadium, leaving the side in 13th position.</p>
      <p>The Citizens will come up against a Polokwane outfit in a bit of a slump of their own, having lost their last four matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Rise and Shine find themselves in eighth position ahead of tonight's encounters, although they could rise as high as third with a victory this evening.</p>
      <p>These two sides have already met in the MTN8 this season, with Polokwane claiming a 2-0 win at Newlands Stadium in August.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
