        <i>Gary Younge | Boris Johnson | Classical music | Japanese honesty | Commons Speaker</i>
      </p>
      <p>Well done, Gary Younge, on your appointment as professor (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/gary-younge-to-join-manchester-university-as-sociology-professor">Report</a>, 6 November). You have a rare talent that makes a reader feel present. I recall a May 2014 article recounting your two meetings with the late Maya Angelou which does it in spades: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/28/maya-angelou-american-titan-died-86-appreciation">As her car pulled away</a> after dropping me off at the hotel, she put her head out of the window, waved, and shouted like a teenage girl: ‘That’s swanky!’ She was 74 and high on life.”<br/><b>Siobhán Ní Chuanaigh</b><br/><i>Dublin, Ireland</i></p>
      <p>• David Dimbleby’s vox pop sessions for Panorama, previewed on Radio 4, included a woman from Merthyr who declared she would be voting for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> because “he has balls of steel”. Does she have any evidence for this assertion? I think we should be told. Even if true, is testicular composition a good basis for our voting decisions?<br/><b>Cherry Weston</b><br/><i>Wolverhampton</i></p>
      <p>• I’m happy my colleague Stephen Morris has had his violin returned (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/03/former-police-officer-praises-gene-who-returned-250k-violin">Report</a>, 4 November). When I left my viola on a train at West Hampstead in 1990 after a long day in the pub, I never saw it again. I hope it gives its current custodian the pleasure that only a viola can.<br/><b>Bill Hawkes </b><br/><i>Canterbury, Kent</i></p>
      <p>• In 1992, while living in Tokyo, I left my bag on a train at Ginza station at around 1pm. At 10.15pm I happened to get on the same carriage going home, and there it was, untouched. <br/><b>Peter Stewart </b><br/><i>London</i></p>
      <p>• It’s a shame I was not eligible to be Speaker. I certainly feel like I need to be dragged to work some mornings (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/04/general-election-news-latest-health-chief-urge-parties-not-to-use-nhs-as-political-weapon-live-news">MPs vote for Hoyle as new Speaker of the Commons</a>, 5 November).<br/><b>Michael Cunningham</b><br/><i>Wolverhampton</i></p>
