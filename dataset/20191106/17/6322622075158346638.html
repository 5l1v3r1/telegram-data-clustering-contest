      <p>NEW YORK (Nov 6): Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said the central bank’s three interest-rate cuts this year have left the U.S. economy in a good place.</p>
      <p>“We’ve made a nice adjustment that takes account of risk management concerns,” Evans told reporters Wednesday, after a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.</p>
      <p>“The setting of policy is good for the real risks that the economy is facing,” Evans said. “It’s good for getting inflation to 2%.”</p>
      <p>Fed officials last week cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point for a third time this year, the first reductions since the financial crisis. They cited the combination of trade-policy uncertainty, slowing global growth and below-target inflation as a rationale for the cuts, which partially unwound more than 2 percentage points of increases between December 2015 and December 2018.</p>
      <p>In a press conference explaining the latest decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it would take “a material reassessment” of the outlook for policy makers to adjust rates again. A stronger-than-forecast report on jobs published Nov 1 reinforced investors’ perceptions that easing is over for now, according to the prices of futures contracts linked to the central bank’s benchmark overnight rate, which currently stands just above 1.5%.</p>
      <p>“The economy is in a good place now,” Evans said. “The consumer has been very strong. I think the most recent data reflect that.”</p>
      <p>New York Fed President John Williams shared the view that the central bank’s actions were helping support the economy.</p>
      <p>“Monetary policy is moderately accommodative,” he said Wednesday at a separate event in New York. “I see this as a reflection of some of these factors global factors especially that are causing or fostering slower growth, and also the fact that inflation is still a few tenths below” the Fed’s 2% target, he said.</p>
      <p>The Fed has been below that goal for most of the last seven years, a shortfall that Williams said has been making it harder to lift price pressures higher.</p>
      <p>“People expect inflation to stay very low and I think that’s a factor that’s holding inflation down,” he said.</p>
