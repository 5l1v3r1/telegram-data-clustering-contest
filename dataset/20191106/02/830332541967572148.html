      <h1>Last month was the warmest October on record globally</h1>
      <h2>Here's what it means for climate change</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T02:50:40+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 02:50</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren M. Johnson, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - As we rolled into November, scientists discovered last month was the warmest October on record globally.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-october-2019">European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service</a>, which analyzes temperature data from around the planet, said October 2019 was the warmest in their data record, which goes back to 1979.</p>
      <p>Globally, October was 0.69 degrees Celsius (1.24 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the average of all the Octobers in the 30-year span from 1981-2010, Copernicus said in its report. Last month narrowly edged out the previous record for October, set in 2015, by only 0.01 degrees Celsius (0.018 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
      <p>Taking only European temperatures into account, October 2019 was the third-warmest going back to 1979. The same months in 2001 and 2006 were warmer, Copernicus said.</p>
      <p>The heat was spread out across the globe.</p>
      <p>"Temperatures were much above average in large parts of the Arctic, while much of western USA and Canada experienced much below average temperatures," the report said.</p>
      <p>This year has seen multiple other hottest-month records, including July, which Copernicus said was the warmest month of all on record, replacing the record set in July 2016. <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/another-exceptional-month-global-average-temperatures">Every month in 2019</a> has ranked among the four warmest for the month in question.</p>
      <p>According to Copernicus, 2016 through 2018 have been the three warmest calendar years on record.</p>
      <p>Monthly temperatures over the past 12 months have averaged close to 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.16 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels, Copernicus said. A report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in November 2018 warned of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/27/world/climate-change-un-emission-report-2018-wxc/index.html">impacts to climate and weather</a> if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels.</p>
      <p>Tuesday's report came the same day <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/world/climate-emergency-scientists-warning-intl-trnd/index.html">more than 11,000 researchers from around the world</a> issued a grim warning of the "untold suffering" that will be caused by climate change if humanity doesn't change its ways.</p>
      <p>Copernicus assesses that since the 1970s the overall average rate of warming of the world is around 0.18 degrees Celsius (0.32 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade.</p>
      <p>CNN's Emma Tobin, Ivana Kottasov√° and Isabelle Gerretsen contributed to this report.</p>
