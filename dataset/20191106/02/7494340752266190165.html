      <h1>Facebook Sued by California Over User-Data Practices Subpoenas</h1>

      <p>California revealed for the first time an 18-month investigation into Facebook's privacy practices and accused the social media giant in a court filing on Wednesday of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-06/california-sues-facebook-over-subpoenas-on-user-data-practices">hampering the investigation</a>. From a report:<i> Revelation of the probe is the latest bad news for Facebook, which is already under <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/10/22/1554223/47-us-attorneys-general-are-investigating-facebook-for-antitrust-violations">investigation by 47 U.S. states</a>. Some states, particularly New York and Nebraska, have raised concerns that Facebook and other big tech companies engage in anti-competitive practices, expose consumer data to potential data theft and push up advertising prices. Facebook had no immediate comment. The Facebook investigations are part of a larger landscape of probes of big tech firms by the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. California's investigation began in 2018 as a probe into the <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/03/22/0553224/facebook-knew-of-cambridge-analytica-data-misuse-earlier-than-reported">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> but "expanded over time to an investigation into whether Facebook has violated California law, by among other things, deceiving users and ignoring its own policies in allowing third parties broad access to user data," the agency said in a court filing.</i></p>
