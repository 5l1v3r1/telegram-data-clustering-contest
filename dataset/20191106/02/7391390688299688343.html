      <p>In a new interview with <i>Us Weekly</i>, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/meghan-king-edmonds-sick-of-the-abuse-after-jim-edmonds-split/">Meghan King Edmonds has responded to Jim’s</a><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/meghan-king-edmonds-sick-of-the-abuse-after-jim-edmonds-split/on-jims-claims-that-she-should-be-worried-about-money/"> </a>latest claims about their divorce. On Monday, Nov. 4, the outlet<i> </i>released a story in which <i>The</i> <i>Real Housewives of Orange County </i>alum shared her thoughts on Jim and the nanny's allegedly unprofessional dynamic, trying to repair their relationship after Jim's text indirections came to light in June<b>,</b> being caught off-guard by the divorce, Jim's family's comments, "[enduring] prolific controlling by Jim," and how little she communicated with <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jim-edmonds-admits-meghan-king-edmonds-split-drama-spiraled/">Jim before he provided a statement</a> to <i>Us Weekly </i>on Oct. 30. She told the magazine that when her estranged husband “gave the ‘nice’ interview” last week, he was speaking on her behalf without her permission. She shared, “At that time I had not exchanged one text message with him and I have still not spoken to him on the phone."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/104652-9-reasons-to-love-meghan-king-edmonds-from-real-housewives-of-orange-county-this-ones-for">The former reality star</a> also said that it is “not fair to [her]” that he implied the two had discussed trying to iron things out. She explained, “He is not my mouthpiece, and I believe the facade he presented is false and manipulative to the public while using and taking advantage of me. I’m sick of the abuse and I won’t engage anymore — and I don’t have to.” She also detailed that his alleged “prolific controlling" has included "hurl[ing] insults at me for a battery of made-up indiscretions" on her Instagram posts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4dyE_qgo-c/">Meghan shared a link to the <i>Us Weekly</i> interview</a> on Instagram, writing, "I’m sick of the ABUSE. Here’s MY TRUTH."</p>

      <p>On Oct. 25, <i>Us Weekly </i>reported<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/meghan-king-edmonds-jim-edmonds-split-after-5-years-of-marriage/"> Jim had filed for divorce from Meghan </a>after five years of marriage. The news was accompanied by rumors regarding <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/meghan-king-edmonds-got-more-suspicious-of-jim-after-sexting-scandal/">Jim allegedly having an affair with Carly Wilson</a>, their family’s nanny. The dissolution of Jim and Meghan's marriage occurred four months after Jim's sexting scandal broke. In June, he admitted to <i>Us Weekly </i>that he "<a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/meghan-king-edmonds-husband-jim-edmonds-denies-cheating/">engaged in an inappropriate conversation with" another woman</a> via text, but maintained that there was not any "physical contact."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/96666-7-jim-edmonds-facts-that-prove-hes-the-most-interesting-real-housewives-of-orange-county-husband">retired professional baseball player </a>responded to the accusations involving Wilson on Instagram on Oct. 28 in a since-deleted post. Per <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>, the caption read, "<a href="https://www.etonline.com/meghan-king-edmonds-husband-jim-denies-cheating-with-the-nanny-its-disgusting-and-irresponsible">For someone to accuse me of sleeping with her</a> is not only wrong, it’s disgusting and irresponsible." <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4LoY4apDjN/">Wilson has also denied the rumors</a>. In a post that went up on her blog on Oct. 29, <a href="https://www.meghankedmonds.com/broken/">Meghan said that while she does not know </a>if they slept together, she does claim both parties lied about hanging out socially, a move that left her with questions. She wrote, “I’ve gone back and forth with my thoughts for a couple days but as I write this, I don’t think he did. But I still don’t understand why he’d lie. And why would she lie?”</p>
      <p>The following day, <i>Us Weekly</i> released a statement from <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/jim-edmonds-addressed-the-meghan-king-cheating-rumors-amid-their-divorce-drama-19284290">Jim where he said he and Meghan</a> had a "rough" go of it for the last couple years, "were lacking quality time together," and "are exhausted and feel [their] life has become one of distrust, kids, work, house, sleep and repeat." He also called Meghan "a truly special woman," said he "[loves] his family," and promised to "make it right again."</p>
