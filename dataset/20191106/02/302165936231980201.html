      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 6 — Hong Kong singer Joey Yung has apologised over a picture of her donning a face mask deemed as supporting protests in the island state.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued through her official Instagram account on yesterday, Yung described the photo as innocent and merely to keep her fans updated.</p>
      <p>“It did not cross my mind that a photo that was taken for fun could lead to the current controversy.</p>
      <p>"For this, I offer my sincerest apologies! I feel sad to have made my family, colleagues, friends and those who love me worry.”</p>
      <p>Explaining the reason behind the photo, Yung said it was to share her joy of flying off to work.</p>
      <p>“It is just to share my recent development. I did not think that my speech would have such a serious impact. It is indeed my oversight,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I love the motherland, love Hong Kong, never supported Hong Kong's independence, and I also love peace and hope everything will return to normal soon.”</p>
      <p>Yung said she would prove herself through her actions.</p>
      <p>“I will continue to share positive energy through my music.”</p>
      <p>Her post had since received over 18,000 likes.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Yung's photo had been flagged by an internet user branding Yung wanting an independent Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The situation escalated quickly and Yung, who took the picture while on a flight, was removed from a gala event in China.</p>
