      <p>KING HUSSEIN BRIDGE, Jordan (AP) — Israeli authorities have released two Jordanian citizens who’d been detained for two months and returned them to Jordan.</p>
      <p>Heba al-Labadi and Abdul Rahman Miri crossed the King Hussein Bridge back into Jordan on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Israel arrested Labadi on Aug. 20 and Miri on Sep. 2. They were held in administrative detention, which allows for open-ended detentions without filing charges against people suspected of security offenses. Labadi was hospitalized last week due to her deteriorating condition after over a month on hunger strike.</p>
      <p>Last week, Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultation to protest the detentions. That’s further strained the tense ties between the two neighbors, who signed a peace treaty 25 years ago. As part of the deal, Israel says Jordan will return its ambassador to Israel.</p>
