      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T02:56:52+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 02:56</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia">Virginia</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats">Democrat</a> who lost her 2017 bid for a seat in the state's House of Delegates in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-keep-virginia-house-of-delegates-majority-after-drawing-of-lots">random drawing</a> following a tie is the projected winner of Tuesday's election.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-wins-virginia-house-seat-in-recount-by-single-vote">Shelly Simonds</a> ousted her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/republicans">Republican</a> opponent Del. David Yancey to flip the 94th District seat, garnering 58 percent of the vote to Yancey's 40 percent, the Associated Press projected.</p>
      <p>Democrats also took control of the state Senate on Tuesday for the first time in 25 years.</p>

      <p>Simonds won her third bid for the House of Delegates in a rematch against the four-term Yancey, who was reelected after winning a random drawing following a tie vote in 2017. Both candidates had received 11,608 votes each in the Newport News district.</p>
      <p>Simonds initially led by one vote, but a recount and a court challenge determined that both candidates received the same number of votes.</p>
      <p>This year's election featured harsh rhetoric between the progressive Simonds, a seven-year veteran of the Newport News School Board, and her GOP opponent, the <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/government/elections/dp-nw-elex19-94th-delegate-20191106-3zgnfvbhezgszfco4qjktbbgti-story.html">Daily Press</a> reported Tuesday.</p>

      <p>She accused Yancey of being as untruthful as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, while he blamed her for the poor record of Newport News schools, according to the publication.</p>

      <p>Simonds also ran on a gun control platform, promising to introduce gun legislation to crack down on firearms trafficking and increase penalties for those who sell stolen guns or use them in crimes.</p>
      <p>She was one of several candidates endorsed by former President Barack Obama.</p>
