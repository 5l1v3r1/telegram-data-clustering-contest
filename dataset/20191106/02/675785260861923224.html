      <h1>Mark Bright recalls night he and Ian Wright were held at gunpoint after road rage row</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: In his moving new autobiography, Bright details the night an angry driver pulled a gun on him and team-mate Ian Wright</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T02:38:58+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 02:38</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Bright</a></address>
      <p>Mark Bright is the former striker who went from foster care to the Premier League and Wembley cup finals.</p>
      <p>During his six years with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , he forged one of English football's deadliest double acts with Ian Wright and helped the London club to the FA Cup final in 1990.</p>
      <p>Bright, who started his professional at Port Vale, also enjoyed spells at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , Sheffield Wednesday and Charlton before his retirement at the end of the 1998-1999 season.</p>
      <p>He has since returned to Palace, where he currently acts as an academy coach and a trusted lieutenant of owner Steve Parish.</p>
      <p>As part of his new autobiography, which traces his journey from loving foster homes to the big time, Bright details the night a heated roadside argument led to an angry driver pulling a gun on him and teammate Wright.</p>

      <p>Before Christmas, the players got the chance to relax at a party thrown by Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic company, who were sponsoring our shirts.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Thomas, who was playing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and was a big friend of Ian Wright, came along as well.</p>
      <p>He volunteered to be the driver with Ian, Geoff Thomas and me as the passengers.</p>
      <p>It was late as we drove back through pretty deserted streets to my flat.</p>
      <p>At some traffic lights we pulled up alongside a car and we could see a man and a woman having some kind of argument.</p>

      <p>The guy in the other car suddenly looked across and wound his window down. “What are you looking at?” he shouted at us.</p>
      <p>This was a red rag to a bull for Wrighty. “What you looking at then?” Ian screamed back at him and, just for good measure, as we pulled away he stuck a finger up at the guy.</p>
      <p>We were still in high spirits, but the laughter soon disappeared when I spotted the other guy was obviously following us.</p>
      <p>Wrighty wasn’t impressed. “Mitch, pull over,” he said. “What’s he going to do? There’s four of us.”</p>

      <p>Mitchell dutifully pulled over so the three passengers could get out to confront the guy.</p>
      <p>“What are you going to do about it?” Wrighty smirked, but the guy didn’t blink.</p>
      <p>He bent down behind the door of his car, pulled out a gun and pointed the thing straight at us.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to count to five,” said our friend with the gun. “And if you lot don’t get in your car and f off, I’m going to start shooting. One... two...”</p>

      <p>We were all in shock as poor old Mitch drove as fast as he could to my flat. The bloke must have been a maniac to do what he did, and we all knew maniacs don’t operate in the same way that normal people do.</p>
      <p>When we got to my flat, we virtually fell out of the car because we were desperate to get inside.</p>
      <p>The reality was, we s*** our pants.</p>
