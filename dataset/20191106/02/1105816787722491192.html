      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) is committed to constructing Mohmand and Diamer-Bhasha dams as early as possible, said Wapda Chairman Muzammil Hussain.</p>
      <p>He was chairing a meeting of Implementation Committee on Diamer-Bhasha, Mohmand Dams (ICDBMD) to discuss various matters pertaining to land acquisition and resettlement, procurement and financing of both projects.</p>
