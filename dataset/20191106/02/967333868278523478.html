      <p>US President Trump was reported last month to be on the verge of pulling his country out of the Open Skies Treaty, which was signed in 1992 and went into effect a decade later.</p>
      <blockquote>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has warned US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a letter dated 18 October that the pact was "one of the last working trust-building mechanisms between Europe and Russia", the <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/usa-entspannungspolitik-open-skies-1.4668965">Sueddeutsche newspaper reported</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>Russia and the United States have repeatedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910271077162289-russia-to-oppose-possible-us-withdrawal-from-open-skies-treaty--lawmaker/">accused each other of violating</a> the Opens Skies Treaty but — country to the fate of the INF missile pact— no irregularity would justify its cancellation, the German government argued.</p>
      <p>Earlier, head of Russia's National Nuclear Risk Reduction Centre, Sergei Ryzhkov, announced that Russia would carry out this week observation flights under the treaty in Germany and in Italy as well.</p>
      <p>According to the official, the observation flight over Italy will be carried out using the Russian Antonov An-30B aircraft. An observation flight over Germany will be carried out on the Russian Tupolev Tu-154m aircraft. The maximum range of the flight over Germany will be 1,300 kilometers (about 808 miles).</p>
