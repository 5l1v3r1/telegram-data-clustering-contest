      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-4-everything-we-know/">Diablo 4</a> may be a while off – it doesn't even have a release date – but gameplay footage doing the rounds shows a lot of early promise. Take for instance the 24 minute gameplay video embedded below (via Game Informer) featuring the game's Barbarian: dialogue is fully-voiced, the environments are suitably dank, and it's unmistakably a Diablo game.</p>
      <p>I'm no big fan of the Diablo series – it kinda just looks like Diablo 3 to me – but Tyler and James are experts and have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/is-diablo-4-dark-enough/">written at length about the new art style</a>. Still, despite how advanced this demo looks the game isn't coming out any time soon – not even 'Blizzard' soon, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-4-offline-mode/">according to Blizzard itself</a>.  </p>
