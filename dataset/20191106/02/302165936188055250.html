      <p>PARIS, Nov 6 — Last season’s Europa League finalists Arsenal and 2017 champions Manchester United can clinch places in the last 32 of the competition this week, while group leaders Celtic face a “titanic game” away to Lazio.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have won just twice in nine Premier League outings but are chasing a fourth straight victory in Group F away to bottom side Vitoria Guimaraes today.</p>
      <p>Gunners boss Unai Emery has stripped Granit Xhaka of the captaincy in the wake of an emotional outburst towards supporters in last month’s draw at home to Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>“I was speaking with him this morning and I decided he’s not one of the captains in our group and I decided that and I told him this morning,” Emery said yesterday. “He accepted my decision.”</p>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who wore the armband at the weekend against Wolves and will take over the role full-time, was also left out the travelling squad along with Mesut Ozil and David Luiz.</p>
      <p>United can punch their ticket to the knockout phase tomorrow with another win over Partizan Belgrade, the Serbian side coached by former Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team registered a 1-0 win in Belgrade a fortnight ago and are one of just two clubs yet to concede a goal in the competition.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian urged his United players to bounce back from Saturday’s 1-0 loss at Bournemouth that left them a dismal 10th in the table.</p>
      <p>“You have got to react, you have got to recover,” said Solskjaer, who is still without Paul Pogba because of an ankle problem.</p>
      <p>“We have two more games before the international break, we’ve got a chance tomorrow to qualify in Europe and then Brighton at home — so we need a response.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Huge incentive’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Back-to-back home wins have fired Celtic top of Group E and the Scottish champions could qualify with three points in the Italian capital, if Rennes fail to beat Cluj.</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon’s side will make the trip full of confidence after setting up a League Cup final clash with Rangers following a 5-2 win over Hibernian.</p>
      <p>“We know what a huge incentive it is to go to Rome and get a result, and off the back of the semi-final win and the feel-good factor, psychologically, the players will all be in a good place,” said Lennon.</p>
      <p>“It’s a titanic game ahead of us, we know the calibre of opposition we’ve got on Thursday night in Lazio, but it’s not beyond us.”</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard’s Rangers face two-time European champions Porto at Ibrox knowing a victory would leave them well positioned in Group G.</p>
      <p>Wolves will look for a third consecutive win in Group K at home to Slovan Bratislava having recovered well from an opening loss in their first European campaign since 1980.</p>
      <p>Record five-time winners Sevilla, who have maximum points and top Group A, will advance with victory away to Luxembourg’s Dudelange, while Roma travel to Borussia Moenchengladbach in Group J.</p>
      <p>The two sides drew 1-1 in Italy a fortnight ago when Lars Stindl converted a contentious stoppage-time penalty for Gladbach.</p>
      <p>Eintracht Frankfurt, who lost to eventual champions Chelsea on penalties in last season’s semi-finals, will look to keep the momentum going against Standard Liege after Saturday’s 5-1 demolition of Bayern Munich. — AFP</p>
