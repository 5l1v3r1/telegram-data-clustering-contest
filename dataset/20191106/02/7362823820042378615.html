      <h1>Fashion and travel blogger Alexandra Lapp, 44, credits age for her success</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T02:01:53+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 02:01</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>If age is an obstacle for women in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/style-and-beauty">fashion </a>and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/fitness-blogger-adderall-drug">blogging</a>, Alexandra Lapp may be the exception to the rule.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old fashion and travel influencer, who has more than 260,000 followers on Instagram, believes she’s found success in an otherwise ageist industry because of her age, not in spite of it.</p>
      <p>“I guess a big success factor is surely my age as there are not a lot of women blogging past 40,” Lapp told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7635919/Fashion-travel-influencer-Alexandra-Lapp-says-40-success.html">Daily Mail</a>.</p>

      <p>“But there are many women of my age and older with buying power out there looking for styling advice and inspiration.</p>
      <p>“I never expected to receive that kind of visibility that fast, therefore this was a very pleasant surprise and helped me to establish myself in the fast-paced blogger industry swiftly.”</p>
      <p>Lapp, who began blogging in 2015 after encouragement from her sister, retired from modeling at 42.</p>
