      <p>BOSTON (AP) — Melania Trump is visiting a Boston hospital’s cuddling program that aims to help infants born dependent on drugs or alcohol.</p>
      <p>The first lady’s stop Wednesday at Boston Medical Center is part of her “Be Best” initiative.</p>
      <p>The hospital developed the program to nurture babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. The hospital also works with expectant mothers who misuse drugs or alcohol.</p>
      <p>Proponents say cuddling helps lower stress in infants born to addicted women. It includes parental presence at the infant’s bedside, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding.</p>
      <p>The White House says that after being briefed on the programs, Mrs. Trump is scheduled to tour the hospital’s pediatric unit and meet with children who have been successfully treated.</p>
      <p>The Boston Globe reports that about 250 workers at the hospital plan to protest the first lady’s visit.</p>
