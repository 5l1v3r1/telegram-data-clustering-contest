      <p>The Popeyes chicken burger craze has gripped America, with videos emerging of impatient customers ranting and fighting over the delicious meal.</p>
      <p>The £3.10 dish originally launched in August, however it sold out in two weeks and was only just reintroduced on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Friends of Mr Davis described his death as 'senseless', while police called it 'pointless'.</p>

      <p>Police Chief Hank Stawinski said: "Something we have to question in terms of how we're interacting with one another as a society, is how does a confrontation over cutting line lead to a death.</p>
      <p>"People are asking how something so pointless could occur. This is pointless, this is disrespectful and that's why I'm asking for the community's help."</p>
      <p>Mr Davis suffered a single stab wound and was rushed to hospital, however he died 51 minutes later.</p>
