      <p>LONDON: Everton midfielder Andre Gomes has been discharged from hospital just two days after suffering a horrific ankle break.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international had surgery on Monday on the fracture dislocation of his right ankle that he suffered during the second half of Sunday's 1-1 draw with Tottenham.</p>

      <p>"Following a successful operation yesterday, Andre Gomes has now been discharged from hospital and will continue his rehabilitation under the care of our medical team," Everton said in a statement posted on the club's Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>Gomes fell awkwardly after being tackled from behind by Son Heung-min, who was subsequently sent off.</p>
      <p>The South Korean was distraught when he saw the extent of the damage to Gomes, but his <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/football-son-s-red-card-for-gomes-challenge-rescinded-12066706">red card was overturned on appeal</a> on Tuesday.</p>
