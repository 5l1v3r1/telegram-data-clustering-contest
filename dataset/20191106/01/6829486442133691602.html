      <h1>‘Sunrise’ Just Loves That The Melbourne Cup Winner Is A Horse That “Grew Here, Not Flew Here”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T01:02:05+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 01:02</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>It’s well established that <a href="https://junkee.com/melbourne-cup-torture/227397">the Melbourne Cup is deeply problematic</a> event for many Australians — often criticised as a vortex of awful combining animal cruelty, binge drinking, and toxic masculinity. So maybe it’s not so surprising that, thanks to <i>Sunrise</i>, a touch of racism has just been added to that mix.</p>
      <p>Yep, somehow <i>Sunrise</i> and Channel 7 have managed to code the story of the Melbourne Cup’s winner with deeply xenophobic rhetoric.</p>
      <p>The moment came as the panel and guest, <i>Herald Sun</i> journalist Andrew Rule, were discussing the background of the winner, Vow and Declare. Vow and Declare was born in Melbourne, a fact that should mean nothing to anybody, but was incredibly important to the folks over at <i>Sunrise</i>.</p>
      <p>“It’s a lovely story,” Rule said. “This is the horse that grew here, not flew here.”</p>
      <p>The “grew here, flew here” rhetoric is one that has long been associated with a particularly virulent strain of Australian nationalism. It’s been a rallying call for racists over the years, particularly popular around Australia day, when it is used to other and objectify anyone who isn’t white.</p>

      <p>That racist rhetoric didn’t just stop there, mind you, and it continued in other aspects of the Channel 7 coverage. In <a href="https://7news.com.au/sport/horse-racing/vow-and-declare-wins-the-2019-melbourne-cup-c-541170">a televised news report on the Melbourne Cup yesterday</a>, presenter Ann Sanders calmly told the audience that Vow and Declare had “repelled a host of foreign invaders.”</p>
      <p>Later in the same segment, reporter Michelle Bishop mangled a reference to increasingly popular protests against the animal cruelty at the heart of the cup, while doubling down on the “homegrown” aspect of the story.</p>
      <p>“It’s just awesome for racing, because we’ve gone through a really tough period with animal cruelty and all of the rest of it. And this is a local horse getting home.”</p>
      <p>Keep up the good work, Australian television.</p>
