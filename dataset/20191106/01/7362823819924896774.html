      <p>The scope of the damage from California's Kincade Fire can be seen from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space">space</a> in a disturbing new satellite image.</p>
      <p>The newly released image was taken on Sunday by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/nasa">NASA's</a> Terra satellite, according to the space agency's press release.</p>
      <p>That satellite is equipped with a special instrument that harnesses thermal infrared channels to detect heat on the Earth's surface.</p>
