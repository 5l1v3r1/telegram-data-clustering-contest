      <p>GERRY Adams has paid tribute to veteran republican Richard 'Dickie' Glenholmes, who died on Monday after a lengthy illness.</p>
      <p>Originally from the Short Strand area of east Belfast, Mr Glenholmes was imprisoned twice for IRA activity, including a lengthy jail sentence in England.</p>
      <p>His daughter Eibhlin was once also the most wanted woman in Britain and was a recipient of a so-called 'on the run' letter.</p>
      <p>Former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams said he was a "proud Ballymacarrett man who dedicated his life to the republican cause".</p>
      <p>"In the hard years when the British imprisoned him without trial and he was locked away for years in England he kept the faith. So did Lily," he said.</p>

      <p>"A republican in her own right, Lily was the perfect partner to Dickie and a wonderful grounded and strong Irish woman.</p>
      <p>"Dickie believed in freedom and in equality. And when the opportunity was created to achieve republican objectives through peaceful and democratic means he embraced it.</p>
      <p>"He was also a husband, a father, grandfather and great grandfather who loved his family. To his wife Lily, his children Eibhlin, Richard, Damien and Michelle and to their families I want to extend our deepest condolences," he added.</p>
