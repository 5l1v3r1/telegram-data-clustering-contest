      <h1>Sanders Rails Against Las Vegas Ordinance to 'Criminalize' Homelessness</h1>
      <h2>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Tuesday released a statement railing against a proposed Las Vegas ordinance that critics say would “criminalize” homelessness by making it illegal to sleep in the streets when beds are available in nearby shelters.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T01:32:01+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 01:32</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Bleau</a></address>
      <p>The City Council is expected to consider an ordinance on November 6 that would make it <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/las-vegas/las-vegas-homeless-camping-ban-faces-legal-logistical-hurdles-1874954/">illegal</a> to camp out or sleep in the streets of the city and in residential areas “when beds are available at established homeless shelters,” according to the <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal</i>. Penalties include a $1,000 fine or six months in jail, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/help-homeless-or-criminalize-them-las-vegas-debates-public-sleeping-n1075111">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Sanders came out against the proposal with force.</p>
      <p>“Homelessness isn’t a crime, it’s a symptom of the greed that is destroying housing in America,” Sanders <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/469065-sanders-comes-out-against-las-vegas-proposal-to-criminalize-homelessness">said</a> in a statement, according to the <i>Hill.</i></p>
      <p>“We are in the middle of a national housing crisis, with Nevada having the greatest shortage of affordable housing for the lowest income earners, while the wealthiest have it all,” he continued. “That has got to change.”</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Hill</i>, the Sanders campaign is planning to “utilize its email list to urge residents to attend a rally outside Las Vegas City Hall on Wednesday, when the city council is set to vote on the proposal.”</p>
      <p>However, some councilmembers say that the ordinance is not intended to “put folks in jail.”</p>
      <p>“This ordinance is not to put folks in jail,” Councilwoman Victoria Seaman said, according to the <i>Las Vegas Journal-Review</i>.</p>
      <p>“It’s to help them get them where they need to go and not have the encroachment upon businesses where you have folks sleeping in doorways,” she added.</p>
      <p>Councilman Brian Knudsen said:</p>
      <blockquote>I look at this as an effort of desperation, really, to try to figure out how to manage a situation that is almost unmanageable. The city’s taking really proactive steps, but it’s not enough, and it’s not fast enough.</blockquote>
      <p>Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman also rejected the implication that the proposed ordinance will hurt the homeless population.</p>
      <p>“The city believes the ordinance will be a benefit to the homeless population, while at the same time protecting the health and safety of the entire community,” Goodman said.</p>
      <p>“The city has always demonstrated compassion for the needs of the growing homeless population, understanding the public safety of everyone is a top priority,” she added.</p>
      <p>Sanders has declared the public housing crisis one of his top priorities, pitching a $1.5 trillion housing plan and calling for a “homes guarantee.”</p>
      <p>“In the richest country in the history of the world, every American must have a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home as a fundamental right,” his campaign website <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/housing-all/">states</a>.</p>
      <p>Sanders has faced backlash on the campaign trail for what some have described as his campaign’s tone-deaf moves, reportedly <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/21/sanders-displace-homeless-sacramento-campaign-event/">displacing</a> part of the homeless population to hold a rally in Sacramento, California, in August.</p>
      <p>The socialist senator was also <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/23/bernie-sanders-faces-backlash-over-pretty-white-queens-rally-that-rally-wasnt-for-us/">criticized</a> by residents of Queens, who claimed that he largely ignored them, despite holding a rally in the area because it is, as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) described, “ground zero for the fight for public housing.”</p>
