      <p>TWO Armagh brothers wanted over the deaths of 39 migrants in a lorry in Essex still cannot be arrested in the Republic.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Ronan Hughes (40) and his brother Christopher (34), who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking, are in Co Monaghan.</p>
      <p>The Hughes family has links to an address in Tyholland in the border county.</p>
      <p>However, it is believed that gardaí do not have the power to arrest them because Essex Police have not yet obtained a European Arrest Warrant (EAW).</p>
      <p>The EAW, which can often take weeks to be processed, is required because the alleged crimes were not committed in the Republic.</p>

      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Stoten said officers had already spoken to Ronan Hughes on the phone but needed to meet him in person.</p>
      <p>It is understood Ronan Hughes, a convicted cigarette smuggler, has had telephone conversations with both Essex Police and the PSNI.</p>
