      <h1>FBI offers assistance to Mexican authorities after deadly attack on Americans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T01:00:43+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Gibson</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi">FBI</a> has offered assistance to the Mexican government as authorities investigate the brazen killing of nine American citizens by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/mexican-cartel-violence">drug cartel</a> gunmen in northern <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico">Mexico</a> on Monday, officials told Fox News.</p>
      <p>It was unclear of Mexican authorities have taken up the offer. It came hours after Mexico rejected <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s overture to "wage war" on the country's drug cartels in response to the brutal slayings.</p>
      <p>“If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing &amp; able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!”</p>

      <p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador thanked Trump but declined the help, saying, "The worst thing you can have is war."</p>
      <p>"We declared war, and it didn't work," Lopez Obrador said, referring to the policies of previous administrations. "That is not an option."</p>
      <p>Officials said at least six children, including 8-month-old twins, and three women living in a faith-based community called La Mora in the Mexican state of Sonora were fatally shot after their convoy came under assault from gunman believed to be affiliated with drug cartels.</p>
      <p>One woman was killed as she exited a vehicle to wave her hands and demonstrate she wasn't a threat, prosecutors said.</p>

      <p>Six more children were wounded and one was missing following the ambush. All nine victims had dual American-Mexican citizenship. They were on their way to visit relatives in Mexico and one was headed to an airport in Phoneix to meet her husband.</p>
      <p>The victims are believed to be members of the extended LeBaron family, who live in La Mora, as part of an offshoot of t<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/mormon">he Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> around 70 miles south of Douglas, Ariz.</p>
      <p>Mexican Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo said the gunmen possibly mistook the convoy for that of a rival drug gang.</p>
      <p>The area where the bloodshed took place is a remote, mountainous region where the Sinaloa cartel has been engaged in a bloody turf war. Many of Mexico's drug cartels have become more brazen in recent years, killing women and children in battles with rival groups.</p>

      <p>"Lately it's getting worse. This is a whole new level," said Taylor Langford, a relative of the dead who splits his time between the Mexican community and his home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Herriman, Utah.</p>
      <p>The killings have put a spotlight on López Obrador's crime-fighting strategy, dubbed "'<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexican-president-hugs-not-bullets-security-deadly-violence">hugs, not bullets</a>."</p>
      <p>Last month, Mexican forces released a son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman after cartel gunmen launched a counterattack in Culiacan, Sinaloa.</p>
      <p>López Obrador said the decision stopped the gunmen from targeting innocent civilians and ultimately saved lives</p>
