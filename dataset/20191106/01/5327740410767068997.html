      <h1>Poppies from the First World War tour country as symbol of hope, resilience</h1>

      <p>Two years ago when Heather Campbell was sorting through a box of books she came across a Bible from her grandmother. Tucked inside was an envelope carrying a yellowing letter and a poppy from Flanders Fields sent during the First World War.</p>
      <p>“When I discovered that poppy in the Bible it was like — I don’t know if this is going to sound silly — it was almost like a tap on the shoulder, a quiet yet powerful whisper from the past,” Campbell said in a recent interview.</p>
      <p>“I was really quite shocked.”</p>
      <p>That poppy was among the many flowers that her great-grandfather, lieutenant-colonel George Stephen Cantlie, sent home with letters to his family. Cantlie served as the first commander of the 42nd Battalion of the Royal Highlanders of Canada.</p>
      <p>The flowers are now part of a touring exhibit called War Flowers that is on display at the Chateau Ramezay Historic Site and Museum of Montreal until early January. It will then move to Edmonton.</p>
      <p>“This exhibit tells stories in a way that balances hope and love with reality, reaching across continents,” said Campbell, who is a registered nurse in Toronto.</p>
      <p>Cantlie enlisted when he was 48 years old in 1915. He fought in battles in Belgium and France.</p>
      <p>He sent his wife and one of his five children pressed flowers from the battlefield with his letters.</p>
      <p>In a recording shared by Campbell her late aunt Elspeth Angus, who was Cantlie’s grand-daughter, describes how he came about his daily ritual.</p>
      <p>“Every night, without fail while he was over there, he wrote two letters. During the day … he would pick a flower no matter what it was, whether it was a dandelion or a rose, a forget-me-not, or a daisy, and put it between two pieces of paper that he had brought over with him and press it in a book to dry out so he could use it.”</p>
      <p>The letters to his baby daughter Celia were only a few words long.</p>
      <p>In one dated July 4, 1916, he wrote: “Dear Wee Celia: With much love from Daddy. At the front Flanders. 1916.” Folded inside is a twig with red poppies.</p>
      <p>Another letter dated “Flanders, At the Front. 28.6.16,” contains daisies. “Dear Wee Celia,” it reads. “From the trenches and shell holes with much love from Daddy.”</p>
      <p>Campbell said the letters and flowers are “probably a translatable story into any time of war, any type of adversity.”</p>
      <p>“Maybe this is a universal message to everyone that people do survive the best they can,” she said.</p>
      <p>“They still can find beauty amidst things that are pretty horrific, and we should celebrate that and remember that. It’s really symbolism, isn’t it?”</p>
      <p>Her mother described Cantlie as kind and gentle. He died aged 89 on Aug. 30, 1956, when Campbell was about two years old.</p>
      <p>Campbell said her aunt recognized the historical significance of the letters she inherited and put the exhibition into motion.</p>
      <p>Viveka Melki, the curator of War Flowers, said she was touched by the simplicity of the letters.</p>
      <p>“This man sends these letters even in the darkest of times. He sends them to his daughter as a symbol of beauty amongst darkness,” she said.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t write an extensive letter, but he writes what’s essential — I love you.”</p>
      <p>Flowers are fragile but they still grew in the middle of battlefields, said Melki.</p>
      <p>“Flowers are a strange thing, aren’t they? They almost have a sacred quality to them.”</p>
      <p>Nancy Holmes, associate professor of creative and critical studies at the University of British Columbia, said the flowers sent a message of hope.</p>
      <p>“And if you send flowers to your family — dried flowers or pressed flowers — they are going to imagine that at least you are some place where there is flowers growing so it can’t be that bad,” she added.</p>
      <p>Stacey Barker, a historian at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, said flowers are not what come to mind when someone thinks about the First World War.</p>
      <p>“You think about mechanized warfare and the horrors of the frontline and death and killing and these flowers are really a stark juxtaposition,” said Barker.</p>
      <p>She said it was “quite poignant” that Cantlie found “these little bits of life on the battlefield.”</p>
      <p>“These little, beautiful, fragile things in the midst of absolute carnage and horror and devastation. He was able to find these living, beautiful, delicate things to send home.”</p>
