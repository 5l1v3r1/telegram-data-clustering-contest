        <b>BACK IN THE DAY</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Irish News, November 6 2009: </b>Jamie Conlan’s decision to switch pro after a multi-title winning amateur career faces a first exam with a scheduled four-round debut at flyweight against Kuwait-born Anwar Alfadi at the Odyssey Arena, Belfast tonight.</p>
      <p>He campaigns out of Sheffield and is without a win. Alfadi has drawn two of five contests.</p>
      <p>One of the contests shared was with Belfast’s Luke Wilton over six rounds.</p>
      <p>Wilton, who opened with three wins, is 1-2-1 in his last four and is matched with fellow novice Kevin Colgan (1-0).</p>
      <p>Conlan’s super-middle stable mate at Breen’s Gym, Joe Rea (6-1-1-1NC), opens the show. Rea’s only loss to date was to Martin Murray in the Prizefighter series last November. His opponent is debut-maker Philip Townley.</p>
      <p>Neil Sinclair (32-7) contests his 40th pro bout. Budapest’s Janos Petrovics (18-28) opposes.</p>
