      <p>The funeral of legendary TV host Gay Byrne will take place on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 85-year-old, who was famous for his time presenting The Late Late Show and a weekend day radio show for more than 30 years, passed away on Monday following a long period of ill health.</p>
      <p>His funeral will take place on Friday at 12pm at the Pro-Cathedral in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Lord Mayor of Dublin Paul McAuliffe yesterday opened the book of condolence to allow people to express their sympathies to Mr Byrne's family.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin and RTE broadcasters Joe Duffy and Ryan Tubridy were among the well-known faces who arrived to sign.</p>
      <p>Crowds of fans also queued in a bid to express their sympathies.</p>
      <p>Sharon Lee from Dublin said she was there to pay her respects to "the king of Irish radio".</p>
      <p>"I think it's lovely that we can come here and sign a book of condolence and pay our respects to him in some way and to his wife Kathleen and their children," she said.</p>
      <p>"It was like he was the father to us all. It was sad that he passed but we will always have fantastic memories of a wonderful man."</p>
      <p>Sean Latten from Dublin said he had listened to Byrne since he began his career and was saddened by his death.</p>
      <p>"My particular memory of Gay Byrne is that every year, on the first of May, he always played for our Blessed Lady, Bring Flowers of Our Rarest, an old-fashioned Catholic song and that always struck a chord with me," he said.</p>
      <p>Tributes have continued to flood in for the Irish TV star, who retired from The Late Late Show in 1999.</p>
      <p>He continued to work across tv and radio, on shows Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and Gaybo's Grumpy Old Men.</p>
      <p>Following his passing, former RTÉ broadcaster Mike Murphy described the 85-year-old as a "once-off".</p>
      <p>Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, he said: "He would never have stopped. He just wanted to continue and continue until he left the Late Late show, in whatever year it was, and I remember a few years later he said to me, do you know something, I could have kept going for another few years. He simply loved it."</p>
      <p>TV presenter Graham Norton said: "How lucky are we that Gay found us? He could have been doing something else, he could have been doing lots of other things.</p>
      <p>"He found television so early and had this kind of weird instinct and understood the medium completely. Those people are so rare. There was no sense of him being a 'presenter', he just was, he was just Gay Byrne on the television".</p>
      <p>TV presenter Dara Ó Briain said Mr Byrne had a "huge" presence in Ireland, describing him as "legendary, instinctual broadcaster; that rarest thing, a gifted listener; and an interviewer of huge emotional intelligence. An enormous life" while fellow tv presenter, Eamonn Holmes described him as "the broadcaster we all wanted to be".</p>
