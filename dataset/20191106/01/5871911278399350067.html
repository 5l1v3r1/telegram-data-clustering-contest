      <h1>Bulls hilariously troll LeBron James with dancing tacos during introductions (Video)</h1>

      <p>LeBron James has made a habit of drawing attention to himself, and his opposition often looks to capitalize on him putting a target on his back.</p>
      <p>James is active on social media, attempting to remain in the spotlight, and that’s where he birthed his “Taco Tuesday” movement — which he even tried to trademark, but failed.</p>
      <p>So when James and the Lakers traveled to Chicago for Tuesday’s game against the Bulls at United Center, his opponents couldn’t help but poke fun at it.</p>
      <p>James was introduced during player introductions, and that’s when the Bulls had a person in a taco costume dance behind him, which was quite funny.</p>
