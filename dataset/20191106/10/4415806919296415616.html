      <p>A George Michael song from the pop star’s final recording sessions will be released almost three years after his death.</p>
      <p>This Is How (We Want You To Get High) began in early 2012, and its finishing touches were added in late 2015.</p>
      <p>Michael died at the age of 53 on Christmas Day 2016.</p>
      <p>His lyrics in the song see the star “addressing society’s ills with his trademark blend of self-deprecation and wry humour”, Michael’s record label said</p>

      <p>The track features in the finale to Last Christmas, a new rom-com inspired by the music of Michael and Wham! due to hit cinemas later this month.</p>
      <p>The movie, which stars Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke, Emma Thompson and Henry Golding, has a soundtrack featuring Wham! tracks and songs from Michael’s solo career.</p>
      <p>Thompson developed various versions of the script and talked through ideas with Michael before his death.</p>

      <p>Michael’s sisters Melanie and Yioda, his father Jack and longtime manager David Austin said: “We hope fans and lovelies everywhere rejoice in hearing this great new song written as ever with Yog’s immense passion and pride.</p>
      <p>“This new track we proudly send as his gift to you this season to bring you all love and festive joy.”</p>

        <i>This Is How (We Want You to Get High), co-written and co-produced by Michael and collaborator James Jackman, will be released by Virgin EMI on November 6. </i>
