      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:17:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>There are 649 patients waiting for beds in Irish hospitals today.</p>
      <p>The INMO's Trolley Watch figures found 464 patients are waiting in the emergency department, while 185 are in wards elsewhere in the hospital.</p>
      <p>The worst-hit hospitals today are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cork University Hospital – 65</li>
        <li>University Hospital Limerick – 57</li>
        <li>Letterkenny University Hospital - 48</li>
        <li>Sligo University Hospital - 42</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The number is down from yesterday's figure of 679 which was the <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/this-is-simply-obscene-679-patients-waiting-on-trolleys-in-irish-hospitals-highest-figure-of-2019-961932.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">highest figure of the year so far</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking yesterday, Phil Ní Sheaghdha - INMO General Secretary - said the numbers were "simply obscene".</p>
      <p>"Winter has not even started, and Irish hospitals are overwhelmed. Our members are faced with an inhumane working environment, while patients are put at ever-increasing risk."</p>
      <p>The INMO had earlier found that last month was the worst-ever October for overcrowding and the second-worst month since records began.</p>
      <p>There were <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/11452-on-trolleys-inmo-warns-of-risks-following-worst-ever-october-for-overcrowding-960867.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">11,452 patients on trolleys in Irish hospitals over the course of the month</a>.</p>
