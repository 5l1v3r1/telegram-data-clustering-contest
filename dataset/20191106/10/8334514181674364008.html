      <p>BEIJING (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday he had raised the situation in Hong Kong, rocked with unrest since several months, with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.</p>
      <p>“I shared our concerns and those of Europe”, he said during a news conference at the end of a three-day trip to China.</p>
      <p>“We have repeatedly called on the parties involved to dialogue, to show restraint, to de-escalate,” he said, adding he had told Xi the “core of the issue (is) to stress the need for a de-escalation through dialogue”.</p>
