      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kevin-the-carrot">Kevin the Carrot</a> has had to wangle his way out of a pickle in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ALDI">Aldi</a>‘s 2019 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/christmas-advert">Christmas advert</a> as the popular anthropomorphic vegetable faces the menacing “Leafy Blinders”.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, Kevin the Carrot has become a popular fixture of Aldi’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/christmasgifts/best-alcohol-christmas-crackers-gin-whisky-wine-champagne-miniatures-a9184506.html">Christmas</a> campaigns, starring in adverts for the German supermarket since 2016.</p>
      <p>This year’s advert, which was first teased last week, sees the festive character go up against a gang of Brussels sprouts inspired by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/peaky-blinders">Peaky Blinders</a><i>, </i>a Birmingham street gang led by Cillian Murphy in the BBC drama of the same name.</p>
      <p>Led by the threatening Russell Sprout, the mob have Kevin tied up against a cheese grater, angry that he and his family have made the carrot one of the more popular vegetables on the Christmas dinner table.</p>
      <p>With the help of a tomato called Tiny Tom, named after Tiny Tim in Charles Dickens’ <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, Kevin is able to escape the grasp of the Leafy Blinders and make his way to a circus tent, just in time for his big performance.</p>

      <p>Kevin the Carrot immediately takes to the stage, banging the floor with a cane as the audience cheer in anticipation.</p>
      <p>He then breaks into the tune of Robbie Williams’ “Let Me Entertain You”, with the lyrics changed for a festive twist.</p>
      <p>“Sprouts are gone and Kevin’s here, shower me with festive cheer, break those mince pies over here, with cream!” Kevin bellows.</p>

      <p>The carrot continues singing as his wife, Katie the Carrot, performs an acrobatic trick, styled similarly to Zendaya’s character Anne Wheeler from the 2017 musical <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-greatest-showman"><i>The Greatest Showman</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“Decorate your Christmas tree, smother me in cranberries, what’s that flying over me, reindeer?” Kevin chants.</p>
      <p>The musical performance features a variety of acts, including dancing mince pies, snowmen, Brussels sprouts swinging from the roof and at the centre of the stage, a mouth-watering Christmas feast.</p>

      <p>Near the end of Kevin’s performance, Russell Sprout enters the tent, wearing his <i>Peaky </i><i>Blinders</i>-esque flat cap and holding a sign that reads: “Sprouts rule.”</p>
      <p>The sprout is thrown into the air, landing inside a cannon that then promptly ignites.</p>
      <p>As Kevin, Katie and their three carrot children gather together, a tagline appears on the screen that reads: “Put on an amazing show this Christmas.”</p>
      <p>Several fans of Kevin the Carrot expressed their excitement over Aldi’s dazzling Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>“Who had their alarms set for this? Aldi you certainly get us all revved up and excited for Christmas when Kevin is soon to arrive,” one person wrote.</p>
      <p>“They get better and better each year,” another remarked.</p>
