      <h1>Adina Valean approved as Romania's European Commissioner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:04:36+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>Keeping her promise to have the first gender-balanced college, future President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has approved MEP Adina Valean as the EU Commissioner for Romania, a spokesperson for the transition team told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, the President of Romania had also proposed MEP Siegfried Muresan to become the country's commissioner.</p>
      <p>“Both candidates had interviews with the President-elect and did well. The President-elect decided for Adina Valean to take on the portfolio of transport”, a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Valean will now face European lawmakers on November 14 in Brussels before her nomination can be officially confirmed — with the objective of having the new college start on December 1.</p>
      <p>Ioan Mircea Pașcu, the 70-year-old former Romanian defence minister, was set to fill-in as commissioner for Corina Crețu, who quit over the summer to become an MEP.</p>
      <p>But in September, Pașcu wrote on Facebook that Romania's ambassador to the EU had told him that she had received instruction to revoke his candidacy. Later, a spokesperson for the Romanian representation to the EU confirmed in an email to Euronews that the nomination had been withdrawn.</p>
      <p>The UK is now the only country that has to name a candidate.</p>
