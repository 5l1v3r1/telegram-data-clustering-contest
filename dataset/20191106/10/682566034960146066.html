      <p>Cape Town - <b>Chippa United</b> will have a tough task on their hands as they welcome Absa Premiership pacesetters <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> to the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Chilli Boys have yet to taste a victory after nine league matches this season and sit rock bottom in the standings on four points.</p>
      <p>Chippa can take heart from their performance on Sunday even though it was a Telkom Knockout clash.</p>
      <p>The team from Port Elizabeth were in the lead twice against Mamelodi Sundowns before eventually playing to a 2-2 draw and lost the match on penalties.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi, meanwhile, will be aiming to keep up their perfect away record this campaign which has seen them take 12 points from their four matches on road.</p>
      <p>The Soweto giants do though come off a gruelling derby against Orlando Pirates in which they prevailed on penalties and might have an eye already on the weekend.</p>
      <p>The second Soweto derby in the space of seven days will take place on Saturday and some Chiefs players might just be caught thinking too far ahead and Chippa might see a chance to sneak something.</p>
      <p>The game kicks off at 19:30 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday.</p>
