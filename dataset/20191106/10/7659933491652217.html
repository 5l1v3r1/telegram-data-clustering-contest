      <p>Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said that breaking away from the occupation is not a slogan, but a push for the Palestinian national product and openness to the world.<br/><br/>Shtayyeh, speaking at the opening of the Palestinian Industries Exhibition 2019, added that the government has designated a day for the national product with the goal of helping disengagement from the Israeli economy and as a step closer to total independence.<br/><br/>He pointed to the importance of economic openness to the world, applauding the visits made by the government to Jordan, Egypt and Iraq, in addition to preparations for government delegations and businessmen to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Russia to discuss the prospects of economic cooperation.<br/><br/>Shtayyeh also noted that imports from countries other than Israel have gone up 16%, signaling the Palestinian marketâ€™s openness increasing.<br/><br/>He saluted the Chambers of Commerce and Industry, representative bodies of the private sector, banks, telecommunications companies, and other security agencies for bringing security to the economy and helping in creating jobs.<br/>Shtayyeh insisted that disconnecting from the Israeli economy is the way despite all the threats received by the Palestinian Authority on the matter.<br/><br/>There have been conflicting reports on Israel revoking permits that allow Palestinian merchants to move freely in Israel as part of the sanctions it began against the PA in response to the freeze on the import of calves from Israel.<br/><br/>Israel has threatened to take a series of measures against the Palestinian Authority because of its continued boycott of Israeli cows.<br/><br/>The Israeli authorities are considering barring the Palestinian Authority from importing goods.</p>
