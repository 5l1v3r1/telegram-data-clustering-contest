      <h1>O'Gara: The call Eddie Jones didn't make that may have cost England RWC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:35:25+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>La Rochelle head coach Ronan O’Gara has suggested that Eddie Jones’ refusal to bend the rules during the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> final may have cost <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> the match.</p>
      <p>Star tighthead <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/kyle-sincker-brutally-knocked-out-just-minutes-into-rugby-world-cup-final/">Kyle Sinckler was forced to leave the field</a> with concussion after just three minutes and he was replaced by Leicester’s Dan Cole. England then conceded multiple penalties as their scrum was decimated by the Springbok pack.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.englandrugby.com/">England</a> went on to lose 32-12 in what was ultimately a convincing win for the South Africans, who deservedly claimed their third Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>Ex-Ireland flyhalf O’Gara was speaking with <i>Virgin Media Ireland’s</i> Nathaniel Cope and gave an insight into his own win at all costs philosophy. The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> playmaker said he was left scratching his head at why the England head coach didn’t make the call to get Cole off the pitch – by hook or by crook.</p>
      <p>“Eddie Jones, if you’re in his head, is plotting worst-case scenario probably, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/dan-cole/">Dan Cole</a> comes in and he’s in for 77 minutes. You don’t have extra legs for him or expertise at tighthead.</p>

      <p>“What are you to do?”</p>
      <p>“The coach in me was saying, essentially, do you bend the rules and become cynical and make them uncontestable scrums. The game was decided by penalties up front.</p>
      <p>“You have to find a way to win no matter what it takes. If you get in trouble, you’ve got a World Cup winners’ medal.”</p>

      <p>There is certainly no doubt that England’s scrum meltdown was the central hinge on which the game swung. Sir Clive Woodward said as much at full time.</p>
      <p>Woodward, who guided England to 2003 World Cup success, told ITV: “No doubt, the better team won. At this level of rugby, if you can’t scrum properly, if you’re going to give five or six penalties at your scrum against a team like this, you’re always going to come second.</p>
      <p>“England will be bitterly disappointed, to go down 32-12 in a World Cup final. They just couldn’t fire a shot because we couldn’t get first phase ball.”</p>
