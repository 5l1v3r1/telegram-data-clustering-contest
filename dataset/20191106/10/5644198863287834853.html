      <p>WASHINGTON: A top ally of President Donald Trump admitted he told a Ukraine official that military aid was contingent on Kiev investigating Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden, testimony released Tuesday (Nov 5) showed.</p>
      <p>In some of the most damning evidence to the House impeachment inquiry of Trump yet, Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, said he told a senior Ukraine official that US military aid would likely not be released until Kiev made clear it would investigate Biden and his son's ties to Ukraine energy firm Burisma.</p>

      <p>Sondland admitted he laid out the allegedly illegal quid pro quo, which Trump has repeatedly denied, in a Sep 1 discussion with Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>He said it was the culmination of months of pressure placed on Kiev, primarily via Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, to open "anti-corruption" investigations into the Bidens and into Trump's unfounded belief that Ukraine assisted the Democrats in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Sondland told Yermak "that resumption of US aid would not likely occur until Ukraine provided the anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for weeks," he told investigators.</p>
      <p>Sondland, appointed ambassador by Trump after donating US$1 million to his inauguration, was fully aware of the linkage made between the US$391 million in US military aid and Ukraine helping Trump prepare to fight for reelection next year.</p>
      <p>"I presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement" Zelensky was told to make regarding Biden and 2016 probes.</p>
      <p>Sondland admitted to impeachment investigators that he understood the linkage was "improper."</p>
      <p>Asked if it was illegal, Sondland responded: "I'm not a lawyer, but I assume so."</p>
