      <p>Babies are expensive.

      <p>This Angelcare bundle, available at Mothercare while it's still trading, includes a movement sensor pad as well as a baby monitor and 5in video display.</p>
      <p>This means you can monitor the nursery and respond if there is crying, but also be alerted to reduced movement.</p>

      <h3>4. Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep</h3>

      </p>
      <p>The Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep machine is a must-have for any new mum and dad. Rather than boil the kettle, mix the boiling water with the formula, and then wait for the milk to cool before giving it to your screaming baby (or babies) to drink, you can use the Perfect Prep to prepare the formula quickly and know that the milk will be the prefect temperature.</p>
      <p>The Perfect Prep machine is particularly useful when you are thumbling around in the early hours trying to prepare a night-time feed.</p>
      <p>Amazon has money off right now, so it's a great time to purchase one.</p>

      </p>
      <p>No matter how you protect your baby from germs at some point you will have to face a cold, or worse. Find out how high their temperature is with this handy little gadget. We find it much easier to use than the flimsy film thermometer you have to hold on their forehead (because kids never stay still long enough for them to work!) This takes a second!</p>

      <p>There's a choice of five lullabies that will hopefully sooth your baby to sleep.</p>
      <p>You also have a range of 250m outdoors - so you could probably get to the bottom of the garden, though not all the way down the road.</p>
