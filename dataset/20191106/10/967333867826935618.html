      <p>Pictures of freaky “eggs” of various sizes captured by Oulu resident and amateur photographer Risto Mattila during a stroll on the nearby beach Marjaniemi in Ostrobothnia have become an Instagram hit.</p>
      <p>By his own admission, this is is the first time Mattila has encountered this 30-metre assemblage of oval egg-shaped ice floes in the 25 years he has been living near the sea.</p>

      <p>“My wife and I stood there marvelling at the remarkable natural phenomenon. Since I had a camera with me I decided to preserve this unusual sight for posterity”, Mattila <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11050766">told</a> national broadcaster <i>Yle</i>.</p>
      <p>Pictures of the weird formations, later published by <i>Yle,</i> left the Finnish public mystified and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911011077195604-kitten-hitches-a-450-km-ride-from-norway-to-denmark-underneath-truck/">scratching their heads</a> over how these <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201909161076814845-alien-fish-with-huge-bulging-eyes-caught-off-norways-coast---photo/">may have appeared</a>. Some joked about eggs without a hen to brood them.</p>

      <h3>Nothing Supernatural</h3>
      <p>Ice specialist Jouni Vainio of the Finnish Meteorological Institute explained that while indeed rare, the “ice eggs” have a perfectly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201909201076844923-straight-from-rehab-polar-bears-facelift-raises-eyebrows-in-norway---photo/">scientific explanation</a>.</p>
      <p>To appear, they require a seldom seen combination of near-freezing air and water conditions.</p>
      <p>The “eggs” are formed around a tiny particle revolving in the frigid ebb and flow, such as a snowflake, a small stone or even a bit of flotsam, with ice slowly growing around it and getting polished by the back-and-forth movement of the water. The right amount of wind is key.</p>
      <blockquote>“Too much wind would prevent the ball from forming. On the other hand, if calm, the water would just freeze on the beach in an even layer”, Vainio continued.</blockquote>
      <p>He also stressed that Mattila was lucky to encounter the eggs, because they only tend to appear for a short period of time, either melting down or congesting into a large chunk of ice, where individual objects are no longer discernible.</p>
