      <p>VIENNA, Nov 6 — When Vienna’s ORF Radio Symphony Orchestra marks its 50th anniversary with a special concert today, it will be under the baton of its new chief conductor who, for the first time in Austria, is a woman.</p>
      <p>Top-tier orchestras in Vienna — arguably the world capital of classical music — are traditionally a predominantly male preserve.</p>
      <p>But industry observers see the arrival in September of US conductor Marin Alsop at the helm of the ensemble as a sign that even deeply conservative Vienna is beginning to change with the times.</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old American — who has previously been chief conductor of orchestras in Bournemouth in Britain, Baltimore in the United States and Sao Paolo in Brazil — said her reception in the Austrian capital has been “very warm”.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t felt this kind of welcome in a long time,” she told AFP after a recent rehearsal.</p>
      <p>Globally, only four percent of conductors are women and the situation is no different in Vienna.</p>
      <p>The city’s world-famous Vienna Philharmonic, whose New Year concert is broadcast to more than 90 countries across the globe, started admitting women only in 1997.</p>
      <p>And men still vastly outnumber women on the podium of that orchestra’s home, the legendary Musikverein concert hall.</p>
      <p>More than half of Vienna’s music students are female, but they are still a relatively rare sight in conducting classes.</p>
      <p>In the rarefied world of conducting, sexist stereotypes — that women lack the necessary strength and authority to lead an orchestra — are deep-seated.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the renowned Latvian maestro Mariss Jansons caused a storm when he said in a newspaper interview that seeing a woman on the podium was not “my cup of tea”, a remark he quickly apologised for.</p>
      <p>Alsop said that at the outset of her career concert promoters tended to hire her because they mistakenly thought her name was that of a man.</p>
      <p>But that was not the case for the ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra.</p>
      <p>“When Marin was suggested to me, I was electrified,” the orchestra’s director Christoph Becher said at a recent symposium on gender equality organised by Vienna’s University of Music and Performing Arts.</p>
      <p>“I proposed her name to my musicians and they were enthusiastic,” he said.</p>
      <p>Patricio Canete-Schreger, head of music at the city council’s culture department, is convinced that Alsop’s presence will help speed up change in the sector.</p>
      <p>He noted that the music university has just appointed a woman as its head for the first time in its 200-year history and has also introduced diversity targets for its conducting programme.</p>
      <p>“These are all excellent signs,” Canete-Schreger said.</p>
      <p>For the students, however, gender is not an issue.</p>
      <p>“Whether you’re a man or a woman, the technique in leading us doesn’t change,” said one young trombonist, 22-year-old Tobias Grabher. — AFP</p>
