      <p>University of Nairobi (UoN) lecturer, Hannah Inyama who kept her dead son’s body in the house for close to two weeks is not fit to stand trial, a court was told.</p>
      <p>According to an investigating officer who appeared before Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga, the don is not mentally stable to stand trial in her teenage son’s murder case.</p>
      <p>Inyama, the officer told the court, will be on medication for the next couple of weeks after a mental assessment test concluded that she was not in her right state of mind.</p>
