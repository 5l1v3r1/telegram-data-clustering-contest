      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Hundreds of convenience stores plan to close all day Wednesday while store owners rally to oppose a proposed ban on menthol cigarettes and to "demonstrate the critical role they play providing vital resources to communities," organizers said.</p>
      <p>Members of the Boston Convenience Store Owners Association and other independent stores across the state -- about 1,000 of them in total, according to organizers -- on Monday will post notices informing customers of the closures and explaining "the risks associated with such a ban including the failure of proposed bans to prevent minors from accessing and using tobacco, racial inequality, food security, and crime."</p>

      <p>The association plans a rally on the steps in front of the State House at noon on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The conversation around banning flavored tobacco and <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/judge-rules-gov-baker-dph-overstepped-authority-in-vaping-ban/1005444298">vaping</a> products has put a spotlight on the question of banning menthol cigarettes, and retailers have mounted a campaign that included a rally last week on City Hall Plaza featuring about 100 store owners and a retired federal law enforcement official.</p>
      <p>The Ways and Means committees of both branches are reviewing legislation (H 4089/S 2357) based on a bill originally filed by Sen. John Keenan of Quincy and Rep. Danielle Gregoire of Marlborough to ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products, including mentholated cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Legislative leaders have mostly avoided saying whether they view menthol as a flavor that ought to be banned, but public health advocates have argued that a flavor ban would be ineffective if it doesn't address menthols.</p>
