      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is giving itself good marks for its performance, halfway through its term, but it's unclear whether that will secure its survival for another two years.</p>
      <p>The coalition of Merkel's center-right Union bloc and the center-left Social Democrats agreed when it was formed last year to assess its halftime performance. That was a novelty agreed during tortuous talks to form the often bad-tempered coalition of necessity.</p>
      <p>Merkel's Cabinet signed off Wednesday on an upbeat report. Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, said that in some areas the government already has achieved two-thirds of its aims.</p>
      <p>But it remains unclear whether other members of the governing parties will be so generous. Scholz's party is expected to consider in December whether to stay in the government.</p>
