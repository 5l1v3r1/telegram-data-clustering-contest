      <h2>WARNING - GRAPHIC PHOTOS: Three mothers and six children from the LeBaron Mormon community were slaughtered by drug cartel gunmen in an appalling attack in northern Mexico</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:11:40+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Grieving relatives found a baby's blood-stained bottle of milk and car seat at the gruesome scene where members of a Mormon family were massacred in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mexico">Mexico.</a></p>
      <p>Distraught members of the LeBaron Mormon community wept and hugged as they peered inside a burned-out SUV that was carrying a mum and four children who were murdered.</p>
      <p>They also gathered miles away where two other vehicles were riddled with bullets in a slaughter blamed on ruthless drug cartel gunmen armed with assault rifles.</p>
      <p>More than 200 shots were reportedly fired during the execution of three mothers and six children, who were travelling in three vehicles that may have been mistaken for a rival cartel.</p>
      <p>A prosecutor said the family members - including six-month-old twins and a two-year-old boy - may have been killed by members of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mormon-family-massacred-gunmen-linked-20822900">an offshoot linked to El Chapo's Sinaloa Cartel.</a></p>

      <p>Relatives of the victims - many of them dual US-Mexico citizens - have been sharing grim photos of the crime scenes to bolster their calls for a tough response from the Mexican and American presidents.</p>
      <p>A family member recorded footage of a smouldering vehicle with the charred remains of a mother and four children inside.</p>
      <p>Rhonita Miller, 30, and the kids - Howard Miller, 12, Krystal Miller, 10, and twins Titus and Tiana Miller, both eight months - were killed when the SUV was sprayed with bullets and destroyed by fire.</p>
      <p>Mum Dawna Langford, 43, and two of her children - Trevor Langford, 11, and Rogan Langford, two - died in a second vehicle. Seven of her children survived, five of whom were wounded.</p>

      <p>Christina Johnson, 29, was shot dead at point-blank range when she got out of a third vehicle with her arms in the air to suggest she was surrendering and unarmed on the remote dirt road in the northern state of Sonora.</p>
      <p>Her seven-month-old daughter, Faith, miraculously survived unharmed and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mormon-family-massacre-grieving-dad-20821665">has been reunited with her father, Tyler Johnson.</a></p>
      <p>Mexican officials said the cartel may have mistaken the family for members of a rival gang, but relative Lafe Langford rejected that theory.</p>
      <p>He told Reuters: "They were targeted and they were killed on purpose."</p>
      <p>Mrs Miller's sister-in-law, Kendra Lee Miller, told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/06/americas/mormons-attacked-us-mexico-border-wednesday/index.html">CNN</a> her family was recently threatened by cartels over where it can travel.</p>

      <p>"Cartels have taken too many of our family members," she added.</p>
      <p>The Mormon community and drug traffickers have had conflict in the past.</p>
      <p>Relatives said Mrs Johnson saved her daughter's life by placing the baby's car seat on the floor before she was attacked.</p>
      <p>Bullets "just missed" her tiny body, according to family.</p>
      <p>Photos posted by family show Mr Johnson with a huge smile as he cuddles Faith on a sofa at home.</p>

      <p>The girl was initially feared dead, but was found alive in the car hours after the attack.</p>
      <p>The massacre happened at three different scenes near the Mormon community of La Mora, about 70 miles south of the US border, on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Mum Christina Johnson has been hailed a hero for saving her seven-month-old daughter Faith, who miraculously survived the massacre unharmed as bullets "just missed" her tiny body.</p>
      <p>Faith's grandmother, Connie LeBaron, wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook:</a> "My son Tyler reunited with his baby Faith just now.</p>

      <p>"God is so good for sparing her life.</p>
      <p>"She is a living angel and has brought hope to our family."</p>
      <p>The victims were members of the LeBaron family, a breakaway Mormon community whose ancestors settled in northern Mexico after leaving Utah.</p>
      <p>The early Mormon settlers in Mexico fled the threat of arrest in the United States for practicing polygamy.</p>

      <p>Family said the Langford children who survived were Kylie, 14, who was shot in the foot; Devin, 13, who was not injured and walked for hours to raise the alarm; McKenzie, nine, whose arm was grazed by a bullet; Cody, eight, who was shot in the face and the leg; Jake, six, who escaped without injury; Xander, four, who was shot in the back; and eight-month-old Brixon, who was shot in the chest.</p>
      <p>Devin hid his brothers and sisters with tree branches as he walked 14 miles home to get help.</p>
      <p>The five wounded children were airlifted to a hospital in Tuscon, Arizona, and a critically injured boy was transferred to a hospital in Phoenix.</p>
      <p>Family members said Mrs Miller was driving to Phoenix, Arizona, with her children to pick up her husband from the airport as he returned home from working in North Dakota.</p>

      <p>Her car blew a tyre and she returned to the community to get another vehicle and left again just before Mrs Johnson and Mrs Langford left with their children.</p>
      <p>Mrs Johnson and Mrs Langford were heading to the neighbouring state of Chihuahua for a wedding due to take place on Friday, according to family.</p>
      <p>LeBaron family members have demanded a tough response from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and US President <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump.</a></p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, Trump threatened to "wage war" against drug cartels.</p>
      <p>A oossible suspect has been arrested in Mexico as authorities hunt the gunmen, according to officials.</p>

      <p>Mexico's Ministerial Agency for Criminal Investigations said the man was holding two bound and gagged hostages in the border town of Agua Priests, Sonora.</p>
      <p>The man was armed with assault rifles and a huge cache of ammunition, the agency said.</p>
      <p>Mexican officials were investigating the reason for the attack, but said it may have been a case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>The LeBaron community is well-known in the region and has had run-ins with drug cartels in the past.</p>

      <p>Members of the family were murdered years ago.</p>
      <p>Alex LeBaron, a relative, told Reuters that the gunmen surely knew who they were targeting.</p>
      <p>He added: "We've been here for more than 50 years. There's no-one who doesn't know them.</p>
      <p>"Whoever did this was aware. That's the most terrifying."</p>
      <p>Mrs Miller and her children were found in a burnt Chevrolet Tahoe near the village of San Miguelito, according to state prosecutors.</p>

      <p>Mrs Langford and her children were found in a a white Chevrolet Suburban just over 10 miles away.</p>
      <p>Mrs Johnson's body was discovered about 50ft from her Suburban near the Sonora-Chihuahua border, with her baby daughter alive inside.</p>
      <p>Cesar Augusto Peniche, the attorney general for Chihuahua, said a violent cartel called Los Jaguares (The Jaguars) operates in the region and its members may have been involved.</p>
      <p>Los Jaguares is aligned with the Sinaloa Cartel once run by drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who was jailed in the US earlier this year.</p>
      <p>It is warring with at least two rival cartels for regional control of the lucrative drug corridor into the United States, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page set up to support the victims' relatives had raised more than £65,000 as of Wednesday morning.</p>
