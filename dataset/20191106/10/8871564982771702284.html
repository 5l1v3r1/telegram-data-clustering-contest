      <h1>US fugitive shoots pregnant wife hostage, self in standoff with Thai police</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:06:16+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>An American fugitive shot his pregnant Thai wife he was holding hostage before turning a gun on himself today during a standoff with police in the far eastern reaches of Thailand.</p>
      <p>Two days after the couple and a third suspect held on drug-related charges stabbed a cop in a daring Pattaya courtroom escape, Bart Allen Helmus shot Sirinapa Wisetrit, his three-months pregnant wife, who he’d taken hostage as police closed in on their whereabouts. He then turned the gun on himself. </p>
      <p>Sirinapa was mildly injured and taken to a hospital. Helmus was taken to a hospital.</p>
      <p>Acting on a tip, police moved in on the three suspects in Sa Kaeo’s Wattananakorn district – just a few kilometers from the border with Cambodia – after their dramatic and violent escape from the Chonburi province courtroom where they were to be tried on a variety of drug-related charges.</p>
      <p><b>Update</b>: <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/american-fugitive-who-shot-thai-wife-hostage-brain-dead">American fugitive who shot Thai wife hostage ‘brain dead’</a></p>
      <p>It was during negotiations with police that Helmus took Sirinapa hostage. The third suspect, Ton Nintet, surrendered to police.</p>
      <p>It had been nearly two full days since a manhunt was launched for the trio after they were filmed by a security camera stabbing Capt. Thanamet Pothipan with a knife and forcing a guard to give them keys, at which point they managed to escape the premises and drive away in a pickup truck. </p>
      <p>
        <i>Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that Helmus was sent to a hospital and pronounced dead. It’s unclear at this time whether he has died or remains in an unresponsive state.</i>
