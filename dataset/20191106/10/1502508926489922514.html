      <h1>Pakistan, China to expand CPEC scope to copper, gold, oil and gas sectors</h1>

      <p>Pakistan and China have agreed to set a new direction to the USD 60 billion CPEC for future cooperation by largely shifting away from infrastructure projects and scouting for copper, gold, oil and gas sectors, according to a media report.</p>
      <p>The Express Tribune reported that the decision to expand the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor scope to copper, gold, oil and gas sectors was taken during the 9th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting that was co-chaired by Planning Minister Khusro Bakhtiar and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) Vice-Chairman Ning Jizhe.</p>
      <p>"The JCC meeting was fruitful, discussions successful and the agreed framework is promising," Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing said, while addressing the media along with the planning minister.</p>
      <p>The Chinese ambassador said the JCC had set a new direction for the CPEC. He said the discussions also took place to shift the Chinese manufacturing unit to Pakistan and providing Chinese financing facilities for future projects.</p>
      <p>"If we could put all energies and Pakistan could provide enabling environment, the newly agreed framework has the potential to transform Pakistan from low-income to a middle-income country in the next five to six years," Bakhtiar hoped.</p>
      <p>Bakhtiar said oil and gas sectors have the potential to attract USD 8 to USD 10 billion Chinese investment in the next three years.</p>
      <p>The planning minister stated that copper and mineral development would benefit both the countries as China remained one of the largest copper importers.</p>
      <p>He maintained that the revival of the Pakistan Steel Mills with the help of China could also reduce the import bill by USD 4 billion.</p>
      <p>The minister declared that Pakistan's security challenges had roots in its neighbourhood and to meet the challenges, there was a need to completely fence the country's borders with Afghanistan and Iran.</p>
      <p>He said that border fencing with Afghanistan would be completed by next year, while the Iran border would be fully fenced in two to three years.</p>
      <p>“Until there is 100 per cent border fencing, Pakistan's security cannot be 100 per cent guaranteed,” Bakhtiar said.</p>
      <p>Ning Jizhe underscored that bilateral economic cooperation would proceed as planned for the mutual benefit of both the brotherly countries.</p>
