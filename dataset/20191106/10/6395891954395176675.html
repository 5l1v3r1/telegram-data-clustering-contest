      <p><b>TEHRAN, IranÂ (AP)</b> - Iran says it'll start injecting uranium gas at midnight into 1,044 centrifuges at the underground Fordo facility.</p>
      <p>That's according to Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, who spoke to Iran's state television on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Kamalvandi says the centrifuges there will enrich uranium up to 4.5%.</p>
      <p>The development will mark Tehran's latest step away from the nuclear accord with world powers since President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal over a year ago.</p>
      <p>Iranian officials have said these steps are "reversible" if European nations that also signed the deal find a way to allow Iran to sell its oil on foreign markets and compensate Tehran for U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran agreed not to operate the Fordo centrifuges.</p>
