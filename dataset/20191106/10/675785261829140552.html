      <h2>Arsenal are facing off against Vitoria Guimaraes on the unusual Europa League game night of Thursday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:30:19+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal are back in Europa League action as they face bottom of the group Vitoria SC - but on a bizarre Wednesday game night.</p>
      <p>After a disappointing draw at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on Saturday, the Europa League comes as a welcome distraction for Unai Emery where qualification to the knockout stages can be all but confirmed with a win.</p>
      <p>Last season’s finalists have won each of their three opening Group F fixtures and have kept a clean sheet in two of them.</p>
      <p>Yet, undoubtedly, their most difficult European fixture this season came against Wednesday’s opponents when the Gunners twice had to come from behind to take all three points.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the match...</p>
