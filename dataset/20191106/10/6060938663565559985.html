      <p>MUMBAI: Australian great <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Adam-Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> feels the third umpire should be able to spot <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/no-balls">no-balls</a> although he is all for the fourth umpire to take the call in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a>, provided correct decisions are made.</p>
      <p>Gilchrist made the comments after the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/IPL-governing-council">IPL governing council</a> proposed to have a dedicated "no-ball" umpire to reduce the number of howlers in the lucrative league.</p>
      <p>"It is pretty challenging for the on-field umpire to look down there, look up there, have everything else going on. Surely there was a replay last year that showed it was a no-ball.</p>
      <p>"That should be allowed, whether you need a fourth umpire, may be not why can't the third umpire just look at the replay and just go not out," he said.</p>
      <p>"That is the simpler version I would have thought. If it means having a fourth one (umpire) and he is going to get the right decision I am all for it," said the former wicketkeeper batsman.</p>
      <p>Will the extra umpire slow things down?</p>
      <p>"No because they can make the decision in an instant. I work in broadcast, they can have a replay within five seconds," Gilchrist added.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of hue and cry during the last IPL, when some debatable decisions were made with regards to front-foot no-balls.</p>
      <p>India skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> even had a heated word with Indian umpire S Ravi, who failed to spot a no-ball by Mumbai Indians' Sri Lankan legend Lasith Malinga, which proved costly for the Royal Challengers Bangalore during one of the IPL matches.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the concept of having a 'no-ball' umpire could be tried in a domestic tournament before a final call is taken on the matter.</p>
