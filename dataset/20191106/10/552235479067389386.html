      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:48:46+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:48</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Leaked pictures of a new <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> top have emerged online as fans got a glimpse ahead of its release.</p>
      <p>The SFA are set to unveil the new strip this weekend, but kit manufacturers Adidas have appeared to jump the gun as the new jersey appeared in shops overseas in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Rumours were doing the rounds on social media, but it's authenticity is yet to be confirmed. On the shelves in the States, it was priced at $90 which is roughly £70.</p>
      <p>The home top is the standard navy blue colour with hoops across it and red and white colours on the sleeves.</p>

      <p>The new kit will be used for Scotland's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> play-off that will be played in March.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> has named his 25-man squad for his two remaining group games against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>

      <p>The dead rubber double header might not have any significance as Scotland cannot qualify for the tournament, but the national team will be looking to build momentum towards the crucial game next year.</p>
      <p>Arsenal star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> has been omitted from the squad as Unai Emery asked for him to be left out so the left-back could regain full fitness.</p>
