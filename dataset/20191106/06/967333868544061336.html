      <blockquote>According to The Hill, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/469164-democrats-flip-virginia-state-senate">Democrats won</a> at least 21 of the 40 seats in the state Senate, and 51 seats in the 100-member House of Delegates. Several races were ongoing as vote tallies reportedly proceed into the night.</blockquote>
      <p>Republicans held slim majorities in the state House and Senate heading into election night.</p>
      <p>The results indicate a major win for the Democrats, who now <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911041077223911-dems-release-first-impeachment-probe-transcripts/">control every level of power</a> in what was considered a swing state just a few years ago, The Hill said.</p>
      <p>Dems now control all three statewide elected offices, both US Senate seats and both chambers of the General Assembly. Democrats also <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911041077217312-andrew-yang-says-trump-impeachment-weakens-democrats-before-2020-elections/">hold seven of Virginia's eleven seats</a> in the US House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>Long a Republican-controlled state, the Democratic Party, in the wake of the rising unpopularity of the Trump administration, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077203965-democratic-candidate-beto-orourke-announces-withdrawal-from-us-presidential-race/">won control on Tuesday</a> of the Virginia government for the first time since 1994.</p>
