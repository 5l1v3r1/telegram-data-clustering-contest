      <p>Small <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">British</a> manufacturing firms are their most pessimistic since just after the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> referendum in 2016 as they face political uncertainty at home and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/trade-war.html">trade wars</a> abroad, according to a <a href="https://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/articles/sme-activity-remains-listless/">survey</a> published on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Confederation of British Industry's gauge of optimism for small and medium-sized manufacturers fell to minus-32 percent in the three months to the end of October, down from minus-28 percent in the three months to July.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The figures represent the difference between the proportions of respondents who said they were optimistic against those who expressed pessimism about the future.</p>
      <p>Companies reported weak new orders - especially from clients in Britain - and little enthusiasm to raise investment spending.</p>
      <p>"Firms are caught between the perfect storm of perennial Brexit uncertainty at home, and sluggish growth in the global economy," Alpesh Paleja, the CBI's lead economist, said.</p>
      <p>"As well as hitting output, orders and hiring, these issues are depressing investment plans across the board."</p>
      <p>Whichever political party wins Britain's December 12 national election must ensure the country leaves the European Union with a transition deal and then push ahead with negotiations for a new, long-term trade relationship with the bloc, he said.</p>
      <p>Britain's economy shrank in the second quarter of 2019 but is widely expected to have shown some growth in the July-September period, thus avoiding a recession.</p>
      <p>As well as Brexit, British manufacturers are facing up to a slowdown in the global economy caused by trade tensions between the United States and China.</p>
      <p>The CBI's survey showed almost two-thirds of the 240 companies which took part cited political or economic conditions abroad as likely to limit export orders, a survey record high.</p>
