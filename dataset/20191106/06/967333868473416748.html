        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a phone conversation agreed to boost ties between the two countries through a strong bilateral free trade agreement after Britain leaves the EU, White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom. The two leaders again reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the Special Relationship through a robust bilateral free trade agreement once the United Kingdom <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911051077224894-second-brexit-referendum-now-very-likely---journo/">leaves the European Union</a>. The President also stressed the need for NATO allies to robustly fund their defences”, Judd Deere said.</blockquote>
      <p>A Downing Street spokesperson <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911061077232349-johnson-deal-not-a-proper-brexit-but-as-good-as-uk-will-get---pundit/">said in a statement on Tuesday</a> that Boris Johnson urged Donald Trump to lift tariffs on goods, including Scotch whiskey and also asked the US president not to impose tariffs on car exports.</p>
      <p>Last month, the United States slapped a 25 percent-tariff on Scotch whiskey and other European products in retaliation for European Union subsidies on large aircraft.</p>
      <p>Separately, Washington has threatened to impose tariffs of as much as 25 percent on EU vehicles and its parts. The Trump administration is due to decide whether to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201910181077084128-eu-regrets-record-us-tariffs-over-airbus-sees-no-other-way-but-to-retaliate--trade-chief-/">enact the duties by 14 November.</a></p>
      <p>The tariffs have already been delayed once by six months, and trade experts say that could happen again.</p>
      <p>The economic dispute has been ongoing since the mid-2000’s when a complaint was lodged under then-US President George W. Bush, but leaders on both sides have been reluctant to take any measures against crucial allies.</p>
