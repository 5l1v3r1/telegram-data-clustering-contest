      <h1>Earth Just Experienced Its Hottest-Ever October</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CBS News: <i>Last month <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/earth-just-experienced-its-hottest-october-ever/">was the hottest ever October on record globally</a>, according to data released Friday by the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-september-2019#">Copernicus Climate Change Service</a>, an organization that tracks global temperatures. The month, which was reportedly 1.24 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average October from 1981-2010, narrowly beat October 2015 for the top spot. According to Copernicus, most of Europe, large parts of the Arctic and the eastern U.S. and Canada were most affected. The Middle East, much of Africa, southern Brazil, Australia, eastern Antarctica and Russia also experienced above-average temperatures. Parts of tropical Africa and Antarctica and the western U.S. and Canada felt much colder than usual, however. While all major oceans experienced unusually low temperatures, air temperatures over the sea were still much higher than average. <br/><br/>October is following a 2019 trend. The hottest-ever September follows a record-setting summer, which included the hottest-ever June and July and the second-hottest August. Overall, 2019 will make history as one of the top five warmest years on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Temperatures from November 2018 to October 2019 were above average for "virtually all of Europe," and most other areas of land and ocean, Copernicus said.</i></p>
