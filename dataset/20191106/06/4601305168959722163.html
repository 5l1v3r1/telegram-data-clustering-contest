      <h1>Two years ago, Juli Briskman was fired for flipping off the Trump motorcade; now she's been elected as a Virginia county supervisor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T06:59:50+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 06:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>In 2017, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/11/06/woman-who-flipped-off-trump-go.html">Juli Briskman flipped off Trump's motorcade</a> as she cycled past it near her northern Virginia home, and her employer, Akima LCC, fired her.</p>
      <p>Briskman had been working as Akima's social media director, and she was fired for violating the company's social media policy. This wasn't merely ridiculous because "riding a bicycle" is not "social media" activity -- but also because Briskman had -- in her capacity as social media director -- reported an Akima exec for calling a subordinate a "fucking Libtard asshole" in a public Facebook discussion of Black Lives Matter, with no meaningful consequences for the exec.</p>
      <p>The manifest injustice of her dismissal -- losing your job for flipping off the most divisive President in more than a century -- prompted an outpouring of support <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/11/13/woman-fired-for-flipping-off-t.html">and more than $142,000 in donations</a> to a Gofundme campaign.</p>
      <p>Now, Briskman has parlayed that public support into something more meaningful: a successful campaign to be elected as supervisor for the Algonkian District in Loudoun County, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Briskman ran on a <a href="https://www.briskmanforsupervisor.com/">platform</a> of school funding, rules for local property development, local government transparency, and a reversal of the Republican incumbent's $14m tax cut, which deprived local government of the cash it needed to provide services.</p>
      <blockquote>The county reliably votes for Democrats at the state and federal level, but Republicans maintain control of the board, 6 to 3, and Republicans have represented the county in Congress for nearly 40 years. <br/><br/>Democrats hope voter hostility toward Trump, combined with a recent population boom and demographic changes, will help them oust Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) in November and turn the Board of Supervisors blue in 2019 county elections.</blockquote>
