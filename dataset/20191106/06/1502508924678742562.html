      <p>Amid the stand-off over government formation in Maharashtra, senior <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sanjay-raut">Sanjay Raut </a>meet NCP chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar </a>in Mumbai on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"This was a courtesy call," Raut told reporters later.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bjp">BJP </a>and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>are locked in a bitter tussle over sharing of the chief minister's post and ministerial portfolios in new government in the state.</p>
      <p>There has been no headway in government formation after results of the state Assembly polls were declared on October 24 in which the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bjp">BJP </a>won 105 seats, Shiv Sena-56, NCP- 54 and Congress-44.</p>
      <p>Raut, who is a Rajya Sabha member, earlier said his party was firm on a written assurance from the senior alliance partner over power sharing, including rotation of the chief minister's post for two-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>He also claimed that there was a "consensus" between the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bjp">BJP </a>and the Shiv before the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/maharashtra">Maharashtra </a>Assembly polls on sharing the chief minister's post.</p>
      <p>The NCP on Tuesday said a political alternative can be worked out in the state if the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>declared that it had snapped ties with the BJP.</p>
      <p>Sources in the NCP said their party wants Arvind Sawant, the lone Shiv Sena minister in the Union government, to resign before going ahead further with the Uddhav Thackeray-led party.</p>
