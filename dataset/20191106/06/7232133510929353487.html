      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After struggling to settle above $9,500, bitcoin started a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/05/bitcoin-btc-price-showing-positive-signs-but-lacking-momentum/">downside correction</a> against the US Dollar. BTC corrected lower and traded below the $9,400 and $9,350 levels. However, the price stayed above the $9,200 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>At the outset, the price is consolidating in a contracting range above the $9,200 support. The last swing high was near $9,435 and the last swing low was near $9,278. The price is currently moving higher above the $9,300 level.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,435 high to $9,278 low. An immediate resistance is near the $9,350 and $9,375 levels.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,435 high to $9,278 low is near the $9,350 level. More importantly, there is a major breakout pattern forming with resistance near $9,375 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Therefore, an upside break above $9,350 and $9,375 could set the pace for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/04/bitcoin-btc-price-stable-above-9k-but-can-it-climb-again/">more upsides</a> in the near term. The next major resistance is near the $9,500 area, above which bitcoin may perhaps accelerate towards $9,600 and $9,800.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the triangle at $9,280. If there is a downside break, the price could retest the $9,200 support. Any further losses below $9,200 might clear the path for a push towards the $9,000 and $8,960 support levels.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin seems to be preparing for the next break either above $9,375 or below $9,280. Having said that, a downside break below the $9,200 support area won’t be easy. Thus, there are high chances of an upside break above the $9,375 and $9,400 resistance levels in the near term.</p>
      <p>Technical indicators:</p>
      <p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is likely to move back into the bullish zone.</p>
      <p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is currently declining and is just below the 50 level.</p>
      <p>Major Support Levels – $9,280 followed by $9,200.</p>
      <p>Major Resistance Levels – $9,375, $9,400 and $9,500.</p>
