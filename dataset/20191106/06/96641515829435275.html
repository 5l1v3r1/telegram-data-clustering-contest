      <h1>‘Red Dead Redemption 2’ PC launch hasn't had the best start</h1>
      <h2>Rockstar has even updated its PC launcher, to no avail.</h2>

      <p><i>Red Dead Redemption 2 </i>finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/04/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-november-5/">launched on PC</a> this week, but much like the escapades of the game's gunslingers, things haven't quite gone according to plan. Players have reported a raft of problems, including issues with the launcher, freezing and recurring crashes.</p>
      <p>The usual go-to fixes for these sort of hiccups -- updating graphics drivers and disabling anti-virus software, for example -- haven't done a whole bunch to remedy matters. As such, Rockstar announced a new update for its games launcher -- but that's not helped either, with scores of players taking to <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1191855189390766081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1191855189390766081&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.trello.services%2Ftweets.html%23%257B%2522secret%2522%253A%2522kNRhwAvbxfUGZETLlHhsb45C8A8j1HxcyZOpe75q7xpbSUqtwWZK6eeNCJpyccA4%2522%252C%2522context%2522%253A%257B%2522version%2522%253A%2522build-4008%2522%252C%2522member%2522%253A%2522594bfad506cca44ad6214754%2522%252C%2522permissions%2522%253A%257B%2522board%2522%253A%2522write%2522%252C%2522card%2522%253A%2522write%2522%257D%252C%2522organization%2522%253A%2522535db1366cfbe3051ea534e7%2522%252C%2522board%2522%253A%2522535db14bdaa739561e16a033%2522%252C%2522card%2522%253A%25225dc2068bc7c3b22a65631240%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522attachment-sections%2522%257D%252C%2522locale%2522%253A%2522en-US%2522%257D">Twitter</a> to complain that they're still unable to play the game, despite following Rockstar's troubleshooting guide to the letter.</p>

      <p>The company has yet to say anything about the continued problems, although with the game set to launch on Steam next month it's undoubtedly working on a fix. EA and Ubisoft rolled out their own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/rockstar-games-launcher-pc/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD5PI_wRz2-KvAEHL6ABvB9C3mF9Nan_gzpXSvXaawt1yt4d2aEeUSbTeYToHq-WgcGoAli5ulR2ddzGJCtDXJLiILBj6yi9g0jxQJG6HOMqzCtpAArW2w9mzDRS7n0JoCKpE4IzYiQElDp5JiAtDz7fNZLsER8ZvuF-Nb1Ar_ai">PC games launchers</a> with relative ease, so it's not a good look for Rockstar that it's already struggling.</p>
