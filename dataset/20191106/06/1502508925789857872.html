      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>Group Corp plunged on Wednesday to a quarterly loss that was far larger than analysts' estimates, hit by the falling valuations of some of its biggest tech bets such as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber-technologies">Uber Technologies </a>.</p>
      <p>The Japanese investment giant recorded an operating loss of 704 billion yen ($6.46 billion) in the July-September quarter. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>recorded an operating profit of 706 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.</p>
      <p>The loss compared with an operating loss of 48 billion yen forecast on average by four analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The group's first quarterly loss in 14 years casts doubt on founder Masayoshi Son's high-risk strategy of investing in cash-burning startups, as he is trying to raise a second giant investment fund.</p>
      <p>The investment conglomerate said its $100 billion Vision Fund recorded an unrealised loss of 537.9 billion yen for the six months as the value of its tech bets such as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>and Uber tumbled.</p>
      <p>The Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund, which is run by ex-Deutsche Bank banker Rajeev Misra, has invested $70.7 billion in 88 <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>at the end of September. Those investments are now worth $77.6 billion excluding exits, it said.</p>
      <p>Last month <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>was forced to spend more than $10 billion to bail out office-sharing startup <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>after its IPO attempt flopped.</p>
      <p>With increased market scrutiny over the path to profitability for many of its bets on unproven startups, SoftBank is struggling to take them to market - an essential step to unlock capital to keep its investment juggernaut growing.</p>
      <p>The value of most of the fund's listed investments, including Uber, Slack Technologies and Guardant Health fell over the quarter.</p>
      <p>At Uber that slide has continued as losses continue to mount and a post-IPO share lock-up ends, with its shares hitting new lows this week.</p>
      <p>SoftBank's investing activities are propped up by other pillars of Son's empire including domestic telco SoftBank Corp, which on Tuesday reported a 9% rise in second-quarter operating profit, beating estimates, buoyed by its cash-cow mobile business.</p>
      <p>SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.</p>
