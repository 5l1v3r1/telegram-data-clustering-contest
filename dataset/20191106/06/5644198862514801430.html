      <p>European champions Liverpool moved a step closer to qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage with a laboured 2-1 win over Belgium's Genk at Anfield on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>LIVERPOOL, England: European champions Liverpool moved a step closer to qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage with a laboured 2-1 win over Belgium's Genk at Anfield on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Liverpool, who fielded a weakened side ahead of Sunday's top-of-the-table Premier League clash with Manchester City, top Group E with nine points after Napoli, who have eight, and Salzburg, on four, drew 1-1 in Italy.</p>

      <p>Liverpool took an early lead through Georginio Wijnaldum before Ally Mbwana Samata levelled in the 41st but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain got the winner eight minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>"Every game is tough in the Champions League. It's a boring saying but it's true. We need to finish the job now. We are in a good position," said left-back James Milner.</p>
      <p>Napoli visit Anfield on Nov. 27 with Liverpool hoping to guarantee qualification for the last 16 before their final group game at Salzburg on Dec. 10.</p>
      <p>Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp named forwards Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane as substitutes, giving a start to Belgian striker Divock Origi against the club where he began his career as a youth player.</p>
      <p>The home side took the lead in the 14th minute with a close-range effort from Wijnaldum after James Milner's low cross from the left bounced off Sebastien Dewaest and fell to the Dutchman who scooped home.</p>
      <p>Klopp's side had several chances to extend their lead but lacked the killer touch in front of goal with Mohamed Salah below his usual level of sharpness, wasting a good chance by blasting wide after another slip-up from Dewaest.</p>
      <p>However, against the run of play, Liverpool were pegged back four minutes before the break, when Tanzanian striker Samatta met Bryan Heynen's corner with a superbly-angled near-post header.</p>
      <p>Again, Liverpool were on top after the interval, with Origi missing a good chance and Virgil van Dijk flashing a header just wide.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain, playing in a less familiar advanced role, restored the hosts' advantage in the 53rd, collecting a neat pass from Salah on the edge of the box and beating Genk keeper Gaetan Coucke with a low drive on the turn.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were comfortably in control from then on but keeper Alisson Becker had to be alert nine minutes from the end to push out a dangerous shot from the impressive Heynen.</p>
      <p>Genk, who remain without a win in the group stage and are bottom with one point, can take some heart from a performance which caused Klopp's side plenty of frustration at an unusually quiet Anfield.</p>
      <p>"With a bit of luck, it could even have become 2-2," said Genk defender Casper De Norre. "Conceding only two goals at Anfield is not too bad. You know you're put under pressure, that is something you can never avoid here."</p>
