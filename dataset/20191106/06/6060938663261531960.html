      <p>NEW DELHI: Veteran Indian tennis star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahesh-Bhupathi">Mahesh Bhupathi</a> on Wednesday refused to admit that he has been replaced as captain of India for the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup">Davis Cup</a> tie against Pakistan saying he is available and believes he is "still captain".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/All-India-Tennis-Association">All India Tennis Association</a> on Monday named Rohit Rajpal, a former India player and chairman of the national tennis federation's selection panel, as the non-playing captain after Bhupathi also refused to travel to Pakistan citing security concerns for the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group I tie.</p>
      <p>"To everyone so concerned for my thoughts and comments. All I know is from a phone call with Mr. Chatterjee (AITA Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee) on Monday where I was told that Rohit is replacing me as captain because I wasn't comfortable going to Pakistan (love the country been there before - not this time)," Bhupathi tweeted.</p>

      <p>"I have not heard from the AITA since Monday or after the ITF addressed the players concerns on venue and approved a neutral location - so I am available and believe in am still captain unless I hear otherwise! Glad to "comment" when I know what I know," he added.</p>

      <p>Veteran <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/rohan-bopanna">Rohan Bopanna</a>, one of the players who refused to go to Islamabad because of security issues, tweeted on Tuesday expressing his surprise over AITA changing the captain before <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Tennis-Federation">International Tennis Federation</a> (ITF) shifted the Asia/Oceania Group I tie from Islamabad to a neutral venue.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, AITA has slammed the players criticising them for appointing a non-playing captain, saying it is not their decision to make.</p>
      <p>"It is not the players' prerogative to comment on administrative matters," Chatterjee told IANS.</p>
      <p>Bopanna said he was shocked that none of the players were "asked or even informed" that the captain was going to be changed.</p>
      <p>"They were not supposed to be informed. It is the committee's decision at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). I spoke to him and I feel he is overstepping," said Chatterjee.</p>
      <p>Asked if he had a word with Bhupathi, Chatterjee said: "I had a word with Mahesh. Our job is to inform them about our decisions and that's what I did."</p>
      <p>The tie will be held on November 29 and 30. The tie was earlier scheduled to be held on September 14-15 but was postponed to November after a security review by the ITF in August. The postponement had come in the wake of pleas from India to shift the tie to a neutral venue or postpone it given the heightened tensions between the two countries.</p>
