      <p>East Kilbride Thistle assistant boss Stevie McPhillips insists daft mistakes cost them the chance to record back-to-back wins for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>The Jags lost 2-0 away to Larkhall Thistle, despite dominating the game at Gasworks Park, and were left to rue defensive errors.</p>
      <p>After a 1-0 win over Glasgow Perthshire last week and with gaffer Gary Hamilton on holiday, McPhillps was looking to lead the club to successive victories and a first away win in the league.</p>
      <p>But it wasn’t to be as Larkhall took the points thanks to a Graham Gracie strike and a Jack Currie penalty early in the second half.</p>
      <p>McPhillips said: “The scoreline didn’t reflect the true story of the game.</p>
      <p>“First half, we totally dominated and just couldn’t score. We had a few shots blocked.</p>
      <p>“But in the second half we made a daft mistake in the 55th minute. We got caught with too many players up the park and we lost a stupid long ball over the top and the boy scored.</p>
      <p>“They got a dubious penalty for their second goal 10 minutes later and in between that we missed a one-on-one with the keeper for 1-1. We hit the post and bar as well.</p>

      <p>“The Larkhall boys said to us it’s a completely different team we’ve got to the one that lost 4-0 to them in the League Cup section at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>“They said we were the better team. I know it’s easy to say that when they’ve won the game anyway, but we were and it’s two daft mistakes that have cost us.</p>
      <p>“The way we are setting up now, I don’t think we should fear anyone. The last two games we’ve played really well.”</p>
      <p>The Jags dropped to 13th in the table after a fifth defeat on the road. However, attention now turns to Saturday’s West of Scotland Cup first round tie with Renfrew.</p>
      <p>The clash was due to take place at the Showpark, but the Jags have switched it to Renfrew’s 4G surface at New Western Park, kick-off 1.45pm.</p>
      <p>The Showpark was waterlogged this week and McPhillips said: “I’m happy for it to be switched because it menas we get it played. There’s been a lot of rain and our pitch doesn’t hold up well to that.</p>
      <p>“I think we’d give anyone a game right now, the way the boys are playing.</p>
      <p>“Renfrew are a league above us, so Saturday will be a good test for us.”</p>
