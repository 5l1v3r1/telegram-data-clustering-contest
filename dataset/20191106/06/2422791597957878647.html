      <h1>Software behind self-driving Uber crash did not recognize jaywalkers</h1>

      <p>An Uber self-driving car that struck and killed a woman last year in Arizona failed to recognize her as a pedestrian because she was jaywalking, U.S. transport regulators said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The woman had been crossing the street "at a location without a crosswalk; the system design did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians," the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In a preliminary report, the NTSB had already determined that the car's software spotted the 49-year-old woman nearly six seconds before the vehicle hit her, as she walked across the street at night with her bicycle in Tempe, a suburb of Phoenix.</p>
      <p>According to the latest report, which was issued ahead of a November 19 hearing to officially determine the accident's cause, the system at no time "classified her as a pedestrian" but rather, considered her an object.</p>
      <p>When the software determined that a collision was imminent approximately 1.2 seconds before impact, it suppressed any "extreme braking or steering actions" to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.</p>
      <p>It did, however, produce "an auditory alert to the vehicle operator as it initiated a plan for the vehicle slowdown."</p>
      <p>Following the March 2018 accident, Uber suspended its autonomous driving testing in all locations in the United States but resumed the program several months later.</p>
      <p>The company has assured the NTSB that new technology in the cars will correctly recognize pedestrians in similar situations and trigger braking more than four seconds before impact.</p>
      <p>According to the report, 37 crashes involving Uber automatic test vehicles operating in autonomous mode occurred between September 2016 and March 2018, excluding the Arizona crash.</p>
