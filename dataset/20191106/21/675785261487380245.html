      <h1>Adidas unveil official Euro 2020 match ball ahead of next summer's tournament</h1>
      <h2>The Uniforia is designed to celebrate the togetherness that next year’s tournament will inspire across the continent as part of its new look</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T21:14:23+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>With the 2020 European Championship fast approaching, Adidas have released the new official match ball which will be used be the 24 participating teams.</p>
      <p>The Uniforia - named in honour of the unity and the euphoria that football can bring - is designed to celebrate the togetherness that next year’s tournament will inspire across the continent as part of its new look.</p>
      <p>The revamped format will see the competition played out across 12 different European countries for the first time ever.</p>
      <p>And drawing inspiration from the tournament’s new look, Uniforia’s design commemorates the notion of crossing bridges, blending borders and diversity of fan and athlete through a unique collision of art and football.</p>

      <p>The design of the ball features bold, black brush-stroke style lines running across the ball, symbolising the blurring of boundaries and crossing of borders as reflective of the competition’s new transcontinental format.</p>
      <p>This new ball offers the same high-performance structure and panels as recent FIFA World Cup models, but with a unique 'Hi-White' material – allowing for better visibility on the pitch for players.</p>
      <p>Anika Marie Kennaugh, product designer at Adidas, said: “When designing an official match ball, we always look to reflect culture; what is the spirit of the street that we can proudly showcase in the stadium.</p>
      <p>"What we saw in our cities – all our key cities – is the need to come together and unite for change.</p>

      <p>"As one of the major sporting events in the world, Euro 2020 is a great opportunity to proudly showcase the power of unity and to celebrate sport as a connector of people, ideas and creativity.”</p>
      <p>The Euro 2020 games will take place in 12 host cities – London, Glasgow, Dublin, Bilbao, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, St. Petersburg, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Bucharest and Baku.</p>
      <p>The GPS coordinates of each stadium feature within intricate designs on Uniforia, commemorating this unique and historic format.</p>
      <p>The ball was revealed on Wednesday night at a star-studded event in London, attended by a host of footballers including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> trio N’Golo Kante, Michy Batshuayi and Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>
