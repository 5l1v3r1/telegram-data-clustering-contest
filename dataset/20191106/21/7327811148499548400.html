      <p>JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- The search is on for the driver of a stolen car who fatally struck a woman in Queens and fled without trying to help her.</p>
      <p>It happened Tuesday night right outside Jamaica Station, where there is pedestrian traffic around the clock.</p>
      <p>NYPD said officers attempted to stop the stolen vehicle, but the suspect declined to pull over and police went after him.</p>
      <p>At some point, the suspect bailed out of Hyundai Sonata, but the vehicle was not fully stopped and kept rolling.</p>
      <p>The driverless vehicle struck the victim in the crosswalk on Archer at Sutphin Boulevard around 9:15 p.m.</p>
      <p>Police have a tentative identification on the victim but have no family notification and are looking for anyone who might know her</p>
      <p>Cell phone video captured the moments right after it happened, as first responders and bystanders ran to help.</p>
      <p>"I saw a car on top of a lady's head," one eyewitness said. "Police officers came, and some citizens, to help pick up the car so that she could be removed."</p>
      <p>A responding NYPD sergeant suffered a minor injury to his shoulder while lifting the front of the vehicle off the woman.</p>
      <p>The victim was rushed to the hospital, but she did not survive.</p>
      <p>Police initially detained a 38-year-old neighborhood man but later determined he was not involved in the crash.</p>
      <p>Now, while one family tries to cope with a devastating loss, investigators are checking area surveillance cameras as they work to track down the driver.</p>
