      <h1>New York: $800K Soros Campaign Fails to Oust Hard-on-Crime Prosecutor</h1>
      <h2>A Political Action Committee (PAC) funded by billionaire George Soros spent more than $800,000 to take down a hard-on-crime New York state District Attorney, but voters re-elected her on Tuesday.</h2>

      <p>In Monroe County, New York, voters re-elected District Attorney Sandra Doorley with 56 percent against Democrat Shani Curry Mitchell, who had promised not to prosecute low-level drug crimes. Doorley, on the other hand, has gone after opioid, heroin, and fentanyl drug dealers with homicide charges when their clients have fatally overdosed.</p>
      <p>The New York Justice &amp; Public Safety Political Action Committee, funded by Soros, <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/10/20/sandra-doorley-shani-curry-mitchell-monroe-county-district-attorney-race-george-soros-pac-buys-ads/3978724002/">spent</a> more than $800,000 in television ads to take Doorley down and elect Mitchell.</p>
      <p>Soros, as Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/05/12/george-soros-funding-da-campaigns-throughout-northern-california/">reported</a>, has put millions of dollars into flipping District Attorney races in states like California, Texas, and Virginia for progressive, pro-jailbreak, anti-drug enforcement candidates.</p>
      <p>Last year, Soros-funded PACs spent nearly $300,000 campaigning for progressive District Attorney candidates in northern California. Likewise, Soros spent almost a million dollars to help elect Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzalez, who refuses to prosecute lower-level drug crimes.</p>
