      <p>Morgan is expecting a baby girl in April, approximately three months before the start of the Olympics.</p>
      <p>“I hope to get back on the field as soon as possible,” Morgan told USA Today. “After having a healthy baby, I want to get back with the national team and look forward to playing in Tokyo.”</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Morgan announced she was pregnant two weeks ago on various social-media accounts, along with husband Servando Carrasco.</p>
      <p>Morgan said she has no doubt she still will be an elite performer after having a child.</p>
      <p>“There are so many women that have been able to come back to their respective sport after pregnancy and continue to have a successful family while playing their sport that they love at the highest level,” Morgan said. “I plan to follow in those footsteps and be one of those women who have a family and carry my daughter around as I’m going to the next city to play. And I still want to continue to enjoy the sport that I’ve been playing for all my life.”</p>
      <p>Morgan excelled in the Women’s World Cup earlier this year, scoring six goals to help the U.S. win the title.</p>
      <p>Overall, Morgan has 107 international goals in 169 matches.</p>
      <p>Carrasco is a midfielder for the Los Angeles Galaxy. He and Morgan met when both were college soccer players at Cal. They married in 2014.</p>
