      <h2>Man City were forced to play Kyle Walker in goal for the last 10 minutes after substitute Claudio Bravo was sent off against Atalanta</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T21:53:41+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 21:53</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City ended up with Kyle Walker playing in goal in their Champions League clash with Atalanta at the San Siro.</p>
      <p>First choice goalkeeper Ederson was substituted at half-time as a precaution ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> after picking up an injury in the first-half.</p>
      <p>And things got worse for Pep Guardiola's side when his replacement, Claudio Bravo, was sent off for bringing down Atalanta striker Josip Ilicic with 10 minutes remainding.</p>
      <p>The Chilean protested the decision and it was checked by VAR, but he was rightly shown a straight red card for preventing a clear goalscoring opportunity.</p>
      <p>It led to Walker being introduced from the bench to put on the goalkeepers' shirt, tasked with stopping the resulting free-kick from a dangerous position as his first involvement.</p>

      <p>The free-kick was fired low and straight at Walker, but he nervously kept the ball out despite spilling it then safely gathering.</p>
      <p>There was a significant display before the substitution with some confusion, seemingly over a problem with the electronic board used to announce substititons.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Walker was introduced in place of Riyad Mahrez, with City being held to a 1-1 draw in Italy at the time.</p>

      <p>Raheem Sterling opened the scoring early on and their perfect record in the Champions League this season looked set to continue.</p>
      <p>But Gabriel Jesus missed a penalty which would have put them 2-0 up before Mario Pasalic scored a leveller shortly after the break.</p>
      <p>Bravo's chance to impress after Ederson's injury blow went badly wrong, but he could have another opportunity to make amends if the Brazilian is ruled out at the weekend.</p>

      <p>His injury was believed to be minor and his withdrawal just a precaution.</p>
      <p>They will still face a nervous wait to see if he is fit to feature against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday, after a nervy end to Wednesday night's Champions League clash with 10-men.</p>
      <p>Bravo's suspension for City's next Champions League game against Shakhtar Donetsk on November 26 could see veteran Scott Carson feature in the matchday squad.</p>
