      <p>Whether it's allergies, dandruff, itchy skin, or you just want a gentle pet shampoo, the <a href="https://cleanerpaws.com/best-oatmeal-shampoo-for-dogs/">best oatmeal shampoo for dogs</a> can help. Everything from age to specific skin issues can determine the right shampoo for your dog's needs.<b> </b>Plus, all the shampoos in this roundup, no matter its specialty, are highly rated.</p>
      <p>Oatmeal baths are known to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/colloidal-oatmeal-baths">help soothe various human skin woes</a>, like eczema and poison ivy. But oatmeal is a great natural remedy for canine skin issues, too. Since a dog's <a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/grooming/evr_dg_shampoo_for_dogs">skin pH level is different than ours</a>, most dogs need shampoos designed for them that are extra-gentle; oatmeal shampoo, specifically, can help relieve everything from allergies to hot spots. Some <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-shampoos-for-cats-18179266">oatmeal shampoos work for cats</a> dealing with dry skin and other skin concerns, too. However, unless a dog shampoo explicitly states that it’s safe for cats, <a href="http://www.vetstreet.com/dr-marty-becker/can-i-use-dog-shampoo-on-my-cat">you shouldn’t use it on feline friends</a>.</p>
      <p>The picks below all contain oatmeal, mostly colloidal oatmeal. Colloidal<b> </b>oatmeal<b> </b>still has <a href="https://oatcosmetics.com/what-is-colloidal-oatmeal/">bran, traditionally milled out of most oatmeals</a> and oat flours, which is the source of oatmeal's skin soothing benefits. The picks also contain other skin-nourishing ingredients — like aloe and vitamin E. In addition to containing quality ingredients, most are free from soap, parabens, sulfates, and artificial colorants and fragrances, all of which can potentially irritate your dog's skin. Many are pH-balanced and one is even hypoallergenic. I’ve even included two picks that are tear-free and puppy-safe, too.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://dogstruggles.com/best-oatmeal-shampoos-dogs/">best oatmeal shampoos for dogs</a> below. From warding off fleas to neutralizing odor, there should be a pick to suit your dog's needs.</p>

      <h3>5. The Best Oatmeal Shampoo For People With Multiple Dogs And Even Cats</h3>

      </p>
      <p>For about $0.23 per ounce, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07923MZ9R?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18811183-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07923MZ9R">John Paul Pet's oatmeal shampoo</a> is great for washing all your dogs affordably. From the Paul Mitchell brand, but designed for pets, this pH-balanced pick is formulated with sensitive skin in mind, and it's safe for both cats and dogs. Similar to others on this list, it contains soothing, moisturizing ingredients including oatmeal, aloe, almond oil, and chamomile. However, this isn't the most natural option, as it doesn't claim to be hypoallergenic or paraben-free, and definitely includes sulfates, artificial fragrances, and artificial colors — but Amazon shoppers love it enough to give it a 4.8-star rating. If you don't need this much shampoo, this pick is also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006UZKKO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18811183-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0006UZKKO&amp;linkId=6af00d7c2506d3224947726906b83281">available in a smaller size</a>.</p>
      <p><b>What fans are saying:</b> “I have been using this shampoo on my dogs and cats for years. It's fantastic for dry, irritated or allergy-inflamed skin. It has a pleasant scent while washing, but it's mild, and doesn't linger after you rinse your fur baby off, so fragrance it not an issue for sensitive-types. All you smell is clean animal! It makes their fur/hair feel soft as well. And I absolutely love that John Paul tests this on people instead of animals!”</p>
      <h3>6. The Best For Flea And Tick Control</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00920YHOO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18811183-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B00920YHOO">Sentry Pet Care Flea &amp; Tick Shampoo With Oatmeal For Dogs &amp; Puppies (63.5 ounces)$18|AmazonSee on Amazon</a>
      </p>
      <p>Combining soothing oatmeal with two medications for managing ticks and fleas — Permethrin and Piperonyl Butoxide — this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00920YHOO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18811183-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B00920YHOO">shampoo by Sentry</a> offers the moisturizing qualities of oatmeal with powerful tick and flea protection. However, while it should be effective at ridding your pup of pests, know that <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/PermGen.html">permethrin is an insecticide</a>, meaning this pick might not be ideal for those who don’t want to use chemicals on their dog. Also, <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/PermGen.html">cats are very sensitive to permethrin</a>, so do not use it on cats or kittens.</p>
      <p>Because this pick isn't advertised as being free from soap, parabens, sulfates, or artificial colors and fragrances — nor does it claim to be hypoallergenic or pH-balanced — it might not be ideal for dogs with extra-sensitive skin. But it is well rated for managing ticks and fleas.</p>
      <p><b>What fans are saying:</b> “This is a really great flea and tick shampoo for our dogs. We have three dogs, two small and one large. We bathe them once every two weeks and this controls fleas and ticks fairly well. We use this in conjunction with our flea regime as well, and seems to help a lot more than just the usual flea and tick shampoos. I like the fact that it is very gentle on our dogs, and would recommend this to most people.”</p>
