      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Mark, 57, and Ruth Chalmers, 59, from Halifax, say welcoming grandchild Koby is “better than winning the lottery” after watching helplessly for years as daughter Natalie, 31, struggled to conceive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T21:37:34+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 21:37</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Thornton, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lucy-thornton/</a></address>
      <p>An “ecstatic” couple have revealed how their £1million lottery win “made their lives” after it helped them become grandparents.</p>
      <p>Mark, 57, and Ruth Chalmers, 59, used some of their winnings to fund their daughter Natalie’s IVF treatment after she had tried for six years to conceive.</p>
      <p>Their daughter had “given up hope” of becoming a mum after suffering fertility problems and enduring five operations.</p>
      <p>The “devastated” 31-year-old was unable to get IVF on the NHS as her partner, Nigel Armitage, 35, had children.</p>
      <p>But her dreams came true after her parents scooped £1million in the EuroMillions raffle in February 2018.</p>

      <p>Today, Mr and Mrs ­Chalmers, of Halifax, West Yorks, said their first grandchild was “better than winning the lottery”.</p>
      <p>The first decision they made after their win was to fund her £8,000 IVF treatment. Two months later she was pregnant after her first attempt and on December 10 last year Koby was born.</p>
      <p>Ruth, a former wages clerk at Tesco, said. “I never thought I’d have a grandchild. It was heartbreaking to watch what Natalie went through for six years. I’ve seen her in tears and in pain.</p>

      <p>“If I could have done, I’d have had one for her, but it wasn’t possible. I thought it was so unfair that because of where she lived she couldn’t get IVF on the NHS. I never thought the day would come I’d be able to take that pain away.”</p>
      <p>Ruth remembers the call that changed her life, saying: “I was in China with my niece on holiday and Natalie called to say, ‘I can’t believe it, the first time and it’s worked – you’re going to be a grandma’. We both burst into tears.”</p>
      <p>Dad Mark said Natalie couldn’t stop crying when she called him.</p>
      <p>He said: “In between tears I heard, ‘I’m pregnant’. I asked her, ‘Why the hell are you crying?’.”</p>

      <p>Mark had just taken early retirement after 33 years with Mars when he won.</p>
      <p>They were planning to take money out of his own pension to pay for IVF.</p>
      <p>Natalie, who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome, said she was distraught after doctors had told her she may need to have her tubes removed.</p>
      <p>“The lottery has made all our lives. I’m so happy,” Natalie said.</p>
      <p>“I had about five operations. They made holes in my ovaries to see if that helped.</p>

      <p>“I thought I’d never have children. So when it happened I was in total shock.</p>
      <p>"It didn’t really sink in until he was born and then I cried and thought, ‘he’s mine’.”</p>
      <p>Mark told how he believes winning the lottery is “fate” and revealed he left his ticket in his wallet for about a month before he checked it.</p>
      <p>He works as a landscape gardener three days a week with his brother and Ruth cares for her grandson.</p>

      <p>Both daughters, Natalie and Leanne, 34, were given a house by their parents, who bought themselves a home with 2.8 acres for their daughters’ “pension pots”.</p>
      <p>“It’s every dad’s dream to see their kids sorted,” Mark said.</p>
      <p>“My grandson has enriched my life.”</p>
      <p>The couple joined 18 winners from Yorkshire and their partners to mark the National Lottery’s 25th birthday.</p>
