      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> play <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/red-star-belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> this evening, needing to win to boost their hopes of qualifying for the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Champions-League">Champions League</a> knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Spurs reached the final in Madrid last season but have made an underwhelming start to this season’s tournament, drawing with Olympiacos and then being hammered at home by Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>But their confidence was boosted by beating today’s opponents Red Star 5-0 at home at the end of October – although the Serbian side are likely to be a different proposition in their own backyard. Follow live coverage below, after updates from Lokomotiv vs Juventus.</p>

Nothing seemed to happen for long periods and then out of nothing absolute chaos.<br/> <br/>It happened twice. <br/> <br/>Tottenham managing to find the back of the net with their attempt and Red Star failing with theirs.<br/> <br/>As both teams want the three points expect a more focussed line of attack in the second half. </p>

What has happened there?! <br/> <br/>Tottenham break after a good tackle from Lo Celso and they have three men facing two defenders. Lo Celso gives the ball to Kane in the box and he hits the post. The ball then comes to Son who has a shot blocked on the line. Dele Alli looks like he was fouled as the ball comes back out to Kane. Kane fires a shot that hits the post again, bounces out, hits Son's knee then comes off the crossbar. Finally Lo Celso gets to the ball and he puts it into the back of the net!</p>
