      <p>A riot police officer screams in agony as flames engulf her body after Molotov cocktails are hurled during protests in Chile.</p>
      <p>Clashes between police and demonstrators have broken out in Santiago following weeks of unrest over the government’s economic policies, including low salaries and poor healthcare.</p>
      <p>The violence has seen vandalism, arson attacks and looting in one of Latin America’s richest nations, where there is also anger at the yawning gap between rich and poor.</p>
      <p>Police have responded by using tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and water cannons against the protesters.</p>
      <p>Two police officers were engulfed in flames and helped by colleagues who used fire extinguishers and their hands.</p>

      <p>The two women, María José Hernández Torres, 25, and Abigail Catalina Aburto Cardenas, 20, both members of the Santiago police special forces, are in serious condition in hospital, police said.</p>
      <p>Chile’s Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel visited the pair in hospital on Monday evening and denounced the attack as “pure violence... nothing to do with the legitimate demands of citizens.”</p>
      <p>He said: “It was a violent, cowardly aggression against two police officers who were working to protect the safety of our compatriots.”</p>

      <p>The two women are among 800 police officers injured in the demonstrations over the last two weeks, along with 1,650 protesters who have been hospitalised, according to human rights groups.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a Chilean prosecutor said today he would seek court approval to investigate 14 police officers for allegedly torturing protesters during the three weeks of intense unrest and rioting in the country.</p>
      <p>Manual Guerra, the prosecutor for Santiago East, said the investigation was related to two separate cases during a nine-day state of emergency in the capital Santiago from October 18.</p>

      <p>One related to the actions of 12 police officers in Nunoa, a bohemian suburb of Santiago, where protestors defied a curfew to conduct successive nights of large but mainly peaceful demonstrations in a central square, a spokesman for Guerra told Reuters without providing further details.</p>
      <p>The second related to two officers in the lower-middle class area of La Florida who were accused of beating a young man who was handcuffed, the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The alleged abuses took place against a backdrop of 20 days of mass rioting, looting and, more recently, peaceful protests <br/>over endemic inequality in one of Latin America's richest nations.</p>

      <p>Today, a lorry blockade of some major highways over high road tolls caused commuter chaos.</p>
      <p>President Sebastian Pinera on Wednesday sent a law to parliament to guarantee a minimum wage of $480 a month, part of an ambitious social spending plan announced last month as the protests grew.</p>
      <p>"We are responding with action and not just good intentions to those things that people have demanded with so much force," he said in a televised speech.</p>
