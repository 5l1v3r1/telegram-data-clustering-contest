      <p>The Rania fandom is buzzing at the possibility of another member being added to the group. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/flaylas/?hl=en">Her Instagram is @flaylas</a> and she was seen in a photo with Rania members Namfon and Larissa. It is just as a rumor right now as no one knows if she is an official member or not.</p>
