      <p>Theatregoers screamed in terror and a theatre in London's West End was evacuated after part of the ceiling collapsed during a show.</p>
      <p>Audience members suffered head injuries after falling masonry crashed down onto the auditorium at Piccadilly Theatre shortly before 8pm tonight.</p>
      <p>Witnesses described hearing screams from audience members, who had been watching a performance of Death of a Salesman.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police said a "few" people had suffered minor injuries and that emergency services remained on scene.</p>
      <p>Journalist Martin George, 41, who was sitting in the Grand Circle, said there were screams coming from the audience as part of the ceiling came crashing down.</p>

      <p>Mr George said: "About 10 minutes into the performance you could hear this slight dripping sound in the [Grand] circle and people were looking around, wondering what was happening, but the play carried on.</p>
      <p>"As the minutes passed, the dripping became more frequent and it sounded like more water was coming through the ceiling, causing a few people to get up and move.</p>
      <p>"The sound eventually got so loud that we stood up and started to leave, as we were wondering what was going to happen.</p>

      <p>"Then, as we stood up, this huge chunk of ceiling, about three to four metres across, crashed down.</p>
      <p>"There were people screaming at that point and everyone got up and streamed down the stairs."</p>
      <p>London Fire Brigade said around 1,100 were evacuated from the theatre before they arrived.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: "Firefighters are attending the Piccadilly Theatre where a section of plaster has fallen from the ceiling during a performance. Around 1,100 people evacuated the theatre before we arrived. Contact @Ldn_Ambulance for casualty details."</p>
