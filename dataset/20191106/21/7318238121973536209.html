      <h1>Labour deputy and Corbyn critic Tom Watson standing down as MP</h1>

      <p>Labour party deputy leader Tom Watson has announced he is standing down as an MP at the next election on December 12.</p>
      <p>In a letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn which was shared on his Twitter profile, Watson said that serving the party "had been the privilege of a lifetime".</p>
      <p>He added that his decision was "personal, not political."</p>

      <p>Watson, who had represented West Bromwich East since 2001, had clashed with Corbyn over the change in direction of the party since the left-winger was elected leader in 2015, most notably over Brexit.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year there was a bid by the Corbynite left of the party to abolish Watson's post, who had frustrated Corbyn loyalists with his criticisms of the handling of the scandal over anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>In his letter, Watson alludes to "the disagreements we have had inside the party are well-known; now is not the time to rehearse them again."</p>
      <p>But in his response to Watson on Twitter, Corbyn too played down the differences between the two Labour veterans.</p>

      <p>Corbyn's letter was even more genial than Watson's, referring to to their "convivial chats about about [...] cycling, exercise and horticulture."</p>
      <p>"I hope the horseradish plants I gave you thrive," he said.</p>
