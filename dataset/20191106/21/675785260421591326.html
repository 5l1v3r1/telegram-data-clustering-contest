      <h1>Voice of The Mirror: The Tories are busy proving they are unfit for government</h1>
      <h2>The resignation of Alun Cairns, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s callous Grenfell comments and James Cleverly caught doctoring a campaign video</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T21:27:51+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 21:27</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>The Tories have spent the first few days of the election proving why they are unfit for government.</p>
      <p>We have already seen the resignation of Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s callous comments on Grenfell and party chairman James Cleverly caught out doctoring a campaign video.</p>
      <p>Voters will question why this inept, malicious and underhand party should be anywhere near power.</p>
      <p>If they are so incompetent at running a campaign, why would they be any better at running the country?</p>
      <p>While the Tories lurch from one blunder to the next, shadow chancellor John McDonnell today sets out plans for a more prosperous Britain, including a new social transformation fund to fix a decade of Conservative austerity.</p>

      <p>Over the next five years Labour is pledging to spend £150billion on schools, hospitals, care homes and housing and transfer power and investment from London to the north.</p>
      <p>Only Labour has the vision and the will to bring real change to all parts of the country.</p>
      <h3>Cuts that cost</h3>
      <p>Doctors are warning the NHS is set for its worst-ever winter crisis.</p>

      <p>The British Medical Association fears more than a million patients will have to wait more than four hours at A&amp;E with a shortage of beds stranding thousands on trolleys.</p>
      <p>The evidence is already there as Nottingham University Hospital Trust declaring a critical incident this week because of the pressure.</p>
      <p>NHS staff are doing everything they can to provide the best possible care over winter.</p>

      <p>The fault lies with a Tory government that has starved the health service of funds.</p>
      <p>If there is a major health crisis they deserve to pay the price at the ballot box.</p>
      <h3>Top prize of all</h3>
      <p>Spending lottery winnings to help your daughter get IVF treatment is rare.</p>
      <p>But now Mark and Ruth Chambers are proud grandparents and their life has never been richer.</p>
