      <h1>General election: Boris Johnson strives to get campaign back on track by promising January Brexit</h1>
      <h2>He has lost a cabinet minister and suffered a serious of missteps on the first day of the campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T21:29:22+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson tried to get his election campaign back on track after it was rocked by a series of Tory disasters and scandals including the resignation of a Cabinet minister.</p>
      <p>Desperately trying to shift the focus he unveiled his party's slogan to "Get <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Done" and promised he would put his deal back to the Commons as soon as parliament returns after the election.</p>
      <p>He said: "On day one of the new parliament in December we will start getting our deal through so we get Brexit done in January and put the uncertainty behind us."</p>

      <p>Entering the stage to loud rock music an ebullient Mr Johnson told a crowd of activists in Birmingham's NEC: "It great to see so many of you here ... at the beginning of what I think is the most important election our country has faced for a generation."</p>
      <p>In his typically verbose style the PM's speech compared Labour's Brexit policy to "the suicidal knights in monty python", the "blocked" parliament to an "anaconda that has swallowed a tapir" and said his deal was ready to go - in the microwave.</p>
      <p>The crowd laughed appreciatively as he joked: "You just whack it in the microwave, gas mark... I'm not very good at cooking.</p>
      <p>Gas mark 4 it is there. It is ready to go. Prick the lid."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: "I have heard some people in the last few days trying to attack our deal.</p>
      <p>"My friends I think they are trying to cast aspersions on it. They remind me a bit of candle-sellers at the dawn of the age of the electric light bulb.</p>
      <p>"Or the makers of typewriters on beholding their first lap top computer</p>
      <p>"They have a terrible sense that they are about to lose their market</p>
      <p>He insisted: "This deal delivers everything I campaigned for for Brexit."</p>
      <p>Earlier the Tory leader addressed the nation from the steps of Downing Street urging voters to "come with us" to get Brexit done.</p>

      <p>But as he kicked off his bid to win back power at a big Tory rally in the West Midlands last night his campaign was already in meltdown.</p>
      <p>Cabinet minister Alun Cairns was forced to resign after lying about his knowledge of an allegation that a Tory candidate had sabotaged a rape trial.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> urged him not to fight the election at all after it emerged he planned to stay on.</p>

      <p>In a desperate attempt to distract from the party’s woes, Mr Johnson ludicrously compared Mr Corbyn’s leadership to the forced removals and deaths of millions of Soviet peasants.</p>
      <p>The PM made the bizarre comparison as he tried to distract from a string of scandals in his own party including a doctored campaign video, a failed bid to use the civil service to cost <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> policies and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacob-rees-mogg">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> ’s shameful comments on the Grenfell tragedy.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson visited Buckingham Palace to formally tell the Queen about the December 12 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> - but was again in hot water after breaking with convention and talking about his private audiences with the Queen, saying “she always asks the best questions.”</p>
      <p>A No 10 source said: “It hasn’t been an ideal 24 hours, but we’re getting the barnacles off the boat now. The campaign launches with the PM shortly and from then on it’s no distractions.” </p>
