      <p>A theatre in London’s West End has been evacuated after part of its ceiling collapsed during a show.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to Piccadilly Theatre on Denman Street shortly before 8pm tonight after part of the ceiling crashed down into the auditorium.</p>
      <p>Witnesses described hearing screams from audience members, who had been watching a performance of Death of a Salesman.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police said a “few” people had suffered minor injuries and that emergency services remained on scene.</p>
      <p>Journalist Martin George, 41, who was sitting in the Grand Circle, said there were screams coming from the audience as part of the ceiling came crashing down.</p>

      <p>Mr George said: “About 10 minutes into the performance you could hear this slight dripping sound in the [Grand] circle and people were looking around, wondering what was happening, but the play carried on.</p>
      <p>“As the minutes passed, the dripping became more frequent and it sounded like more water was coming through the ceiling, causing a few people to get up and move.</p>
      <p>“The sound eventually got so loud that we stood up and started to leave, as we were wondering what was going to happen.</p>
      <p>“Then, as we stood up, this huge chunk of ceiling, about three to four metres across, crashed down.</p>

      <p>The London Ambulance Service, London Fire Brigade and Metropolitan Police were called to the scene and road closures are in place around the theatre, Scotland Yard said.</p>
      <p>The Met Police tweeted: “Everyone is out of the theatre. A few people have suffered minor injuries. Road closures in place. Motorists advised to use alternative routes.”</p>
      <p>It is not the first time a ceiling has collapsed in one of London’s theatres.</p>
      <p>In 2013, 80 people were injured – seven seriously – after part of the Apollo Theatre’s ceiling collapsed on top of them.</p>
      <p>More than 700 people were inside the Shaftesbury Avenue venue – which was 45 minutes into the National Theatre’s performance of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time – when the incident took place.</p>
