      <p>A brief panic occurred at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Wednesday after a false alarm caused authorities to believe there was a possible hijacking situation.</p>
      <p>The Royal Netherlands Marechaussee said it was investigating a "suspicious situation" on an aircraft at about 7:30 p.m. local time. About an hour later both the police and the airport confirmed that passengers and crew members were safely removed from the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Air Europa tweeted shortly after to explain that the a warning that activates hijacking protocols was accidentally triggered on a flight from Amsterdam to Madrid.</p>
      <p>"Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and sound waiting to fly soon," the airline said. "We deeply apologize."</p>
      <p>Schiphol is the main international airport in the Netherlands. The hub flies to 326 destinations and served 71 million passengers last year, according to its website.</p>
