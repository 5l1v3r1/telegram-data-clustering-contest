      <p>The dissolution of the current Parliament means that both the House of Commons and the House of Lords end their activity. A new House of Commons <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911041077218240-uk-parliament-set-to-elect-new-speaker-to-replace-john-bercow-on-eve-of-dissolution/">will be elected</a> on 12 December, while the Lords will retain their positions.</p>
      <p>Under normal circumstances, a new Speaker of the House is also elected, along with the House of Commons, but this year, Lindsay Hoyle <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911041077222041-uk-parliament-elects-sir-lindsay-hoyle-as-its-new-speaker/">was elected early</a> to replace John Bercow following his September resignation.</p>
      <p>Under the Fixed-term Paliaments Act 2011, the UK Parliament must be reelected every five years, which means the next general election was supposed to take place in 2022. However, on 29 October, the House of Commons <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911061077232349-johnson-deal-not-a-proper-brexit-but-as-good-as-uk-will-get---pundit/">voted for early elections</a> in December over the ongoing political Brexit impasse.</p>
