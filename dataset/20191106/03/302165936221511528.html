      <p>KUCHING, Nov 6 — A war of words broke out between Assistant Minister of Coastal Roads Datuk Juhaihi Narawai and Ba’Kelalan assemblyman Baru Bian during Question Time in the Sarawak State Assembly this morning.</p>
      <p>It all started when Julaihi, answering questions from Yussibnosh Balo (GPS-Telian), told Pakatan Harapan (PH) representatives in the federal government to “<i>jangan takut boss</i>” and get more funds for Sarawak.</p>
      <p>He said many infrastructure projects, approved by Barisan Nasional (BN) government before last year’s general election being dropped after PH took Putrajaya.</p>
      <p>As examples, Julaihi listed the proposed construction of bridges in Batang Lupar, Batang Igan and Batang Rambungan.</p>
      <p>An upset Baru stood up and accused the state assistant minister of making improper remarks against another member and demanded Julaihi retract his remark.</p>
      <p>Baru, who is also the federal works minister, said the infrastructure projects had been approved by the previous government without putting aside the money for them.</p>
      <p>“There is no issue of being <i>takut</i> (afraid) of the boss. We are a responsible government and we will execute the projects within the financial capability of the federal government,” he said.</p>
      <p>Julaihi then asked Baru to explain why the federal government had approved more projects in the peninsula if the funds were insufficient for Sarawak.</p>
      <p>Speaker Datuk Amar Asfia Awang Nasar also intervened at this point and told Yussibnosh to pose his two supplementary questions for Juhaili.</p>
      <p>Baru, who is also Selangau MP, later told reporters that he felt compelled to rebut the assistant minister because the latter made an “improper motive”.</p>
      <p>“When you impute an improper motive, I have to stand up,” he said.</p>
      <p>Baru added that he is not afraid of the “boss”, saying that in the federal Cabinet meetings, ministers had freedom of speech.</p>
      <p>“There is no such thing of scared of the boss. When you look at your responsibilities as the Cabinet members, we discussed issues very openly.</p>
      <p>“If you look at the Budget 2020, special focus has been put on Sarawak and Sabah,” he said.</p>
