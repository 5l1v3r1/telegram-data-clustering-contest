        <b>A road safety campaigner who built a fake speed camera from guttering and drainpipe has taken it down because motorists caught on it was not real.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mike Lacey, 73, built the £40 dummy device in a bid to slow down drivers on the A1 dual carriageway outside his home in Beeston, Bedfordshire.</p>
      <p>However, drivers began "beeping their horns" at the improvised camera in a snub to his efforts, he said.</p>
      <p>"Its exposure as a fake was its undoing," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Lacey said the removal of covers from a real camera nearby was "having the desired effect for the time being" in reducing speeds in the area.</p>
      <p>Highways England has been asked for comment.</p>
      <p>It previously acknowledged Mr Lacey's "commitment to safety and his ingenuity" but made a complaint to Central Bedfordshire Council.</p>

      <p>Mr Lacey, a retired petrochemical engineer, said he was prompted to install the dummy camera on the side of his Grade II listed home 18 months ago because drivers were reaching 90mph (144km/h) on the road, which has a 50mph (80km/h) limit.</p>
      <p>The village of Beeston, between Biggleswade and Sandy, is effectively split in two by the A1.</p>
      <p>Mr Lacey said there had been fatalities along the stretch of road in the past, and two major speed-related crashes in the past three months alone.</p>
      <p>"This is a very neglected section of road. My fake average speed camera worked until it got exposed," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Lacey built the device using guttering and drainpipe bought at a DIY store.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-45680617">he told the BBC in October 2018</a> that a Central Bedfordshire Council officer asked him to remove the fake camera following a complaint from Highways England, which said it distracted drivers.</p>
      <p>He refused, claiming: "The camera I've put up works. You can actually see brake lights coming on."</p>
