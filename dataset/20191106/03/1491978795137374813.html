        <i>Junius Ho hospitalised after attack that comes amid protests</i>
      </p>
      <p>The pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho has been attacked in an apparent stabbing in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p>
      <p>Ho, who is running in the upcoming district council election, was out campaigning in his constituency on Wednesday when he was attacked.</p>
      <p>In a video of the incident, a man holding a bunch of flowers approaches and speaks to Ho, then reaches into his bag and pulls out an implement, believed to be a knife, which he uses to stab Ho.</p>
      <p>The man could be heard shouting in Cantonese: “Junius Ho, you scum!”</p>
      <p>The attacker was arrested by police, <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/11/06/just-pro-beijing-hong-kong-lawmaker-junius-ho-attacked-tuen-mun/">according to Hong Kong Free Press</a>. Ho was taken to Tuen Mun hospital with a stab wound to his chest. The the alleged attacker and one of Ho’s aides were also taken to hospital with injuries, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3036492/hong-kong-lawmaker-junius-ho-injured-along-two-others-knife">South China Morning Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Alongside Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam and police chief Stephen Lo, Ho has become one of the most loathed establishment figures among democracy protesters.</p>
      <p>He has long been one of the most stridently pro-Beijing politicians in the city.</p>
      <p>He attracted criticism after he was captured on a video that went viral shaking hands with men in white T-shirts. The video followed an attack on protesters and other MTR passengers by a group of men in white T-shirts at Yuen Long MTR station in July, which resulted in 45 people being injured.</p>
      <p>Ho denied that the people he shook hands with had any connection to the attackers at Yuen Long.</p>
      <p>The attack on Ho comes amid more than five months of sometimes violent political unrest in the former British colony-turned semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Further protests were planned on Wednesday at some of Hong Kong’s universities, activists said. Police fired water cannon to disperse protesters at a Guy Fawkes-themed march on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>China’s Communist Party said on Tuesday it would not tolerate any “separatist behaviour” in Hong Kong, after some of the protesters called for independence.</p>
      <p>What started as a protest against a proposed China extradition bill has widened into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/chinas-xi-jinping-expresses-high-degree-of-trust-in-hong-kongs-carrie-lam">gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s rule</a> since he came to power in 2012.</p>
      <p>Protesters are demanding an end to perceived Chinese meddling in the territory’s affairs, as well as universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, among other demands.</p>
      <p>Beijing denies interfering and blames foreign governments for fuelling the unrest. <br/>Xi met Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday in Shanghai, vouching support for her administration.</p>
      <p>Following the meeting, Lam denied rumours that the government was considering an amnesty for protesters charged with offences.</p>
