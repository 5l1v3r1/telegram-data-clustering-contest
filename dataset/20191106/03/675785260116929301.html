      <p>Kai Havertz believes he has what it takes to play for clubs outside of Germany as the Bayer Leverkusen star continues to be linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>The German midfielder is widely considered one of the most talented players in Europe and is expected to be one of the most in-demand players in next summer's transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are reportedly considering <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-weigh-up-80m-20818878">a potential Â£80million move</a> for the 20-year-old, who scored 17 goals in the Bundesliga last season and has two to his name so far this campaign.</p>
      <p>Havertz has also been linked with the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , and refused to rule out a move abroad, despite insisting that he remains focused on the current season.</p>

      <p>"I think I've picked up enough international experience at Leverkusen," he told Spanish publication <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2019/11/05/5dc0f115ca47418c028b45c5.html">Marca</a> in an interview.</p>
      <p>"I know the rhythm of these international matches and I'm confident that I can go abroad at any moment and play at clubs outside of Germany.</p>
      <p>"For the moment, I want to have a good season. Afterwards, we'll see."</p>
      <p>Havertz is also attracting plenty of attention from teams within Germany, with defending Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich among those thought to be most interested in the youngster.</p>

      <p>"They're probably the biggest club in Germany and there are many players that were very successful at a young age that went there," he added. "Therefore, I get linked with Bayern, but we'll see what happens.</p>
      <p>"There are players that want to stay close to their family and others say, 'I want to live in another country'.</p>
      <p>"There's something clear: if you want to be a star in Germany, you can't go wrong with Bayern."</p>
      <p>Havertz is expected to in action when Leverkusen host Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Peter Bosz's side still yet to pick up a point in Group D.</p>

      <p>And despite slipping to a 1-0 defeat in their first meeting with Diego Simeone's side, the midfielder is confident things will be different this time around.</p>
      <p>"We're playing at home and our own fans give us a bit of a boost," added Havertz, who is yet to open his goalscoring account in Europe this season.</p>
      <p>"Now we know, after the first game, how they play. I think we did quite well at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
      <p>"We have a big chance to get something out of this game."</p>
