      <h1>Masvidal: Mayweather-McGregor showed me how boxers can’t read MMA fighters that well</h1>

      <p>After winning the “BMF” title at UFC 244 with a win over Nate Diaz, Jorge Masvidal looked at some plans outside of MMA. One of them is a boxing match against newly-crowned WBO light heavyweight champion Saul “Canelo” Alvarez.</p>

      <p>“I can box. I can hit hard. I’ve got different angles. I’m not going to get tired in a 12 round boxing event, especially if I have time to prepare for it,” Masvidal said <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/4/20947950/ufc-244-mma-news-interview-boxing-jorge-masvidal-canelo-alvarez-fight-new-york-nate-diaz">during the post-fight scrum</a>. “It’s just kind of fate. He’s fighting today, I’m fighting today. I heard we f—king killed him on the pay-per-views.”</p>
      <p>On Monday’s episode of the Ariel Helwani MMA Show, “Gamebred” double-downed on his callout.</p>
      <p>“I’m dead serious about trying to fight Canelo Alvarez, man,” he said. “They’ll give me a nice little change, I’d take my talents over there, and I’m going for the off button, man. I feel like I can shock the world.”</p>
      <p>Masvidal is actually liking his chances against the multiple-time world champion boxer, based on how he saw the 2017 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor unfold.</p>
      <p>“In the wake of Conor and Mayweather, it showed me a lot of things that I thought were good and bad,” Masvidal said. “I saw they can’t read us as well as they can read a boxer. Our movements are different. How we cover distance is different. Those things give them problems.</p>
      <p>”I think I can throw enough punches that I can attack Canelo and put him on his ass. I’d be going for the knockout, obviously. Nothing else. This is not to disrespect Canelo, because I think the dude is a beast. I think he’s a stud.</p>
      <p>“It would be an honor to get in the ring with him,” he added. “But he did say some sh-t like no MMA fighter would be a challenge and this and that. I beg to differ.”</p>

      <p>Masvidal capped off 2019 with a three-fight win streak and the “baddest motherf—ker” title to boot. He currently holds a record of 35-13 (with 18 wins by stoppage).</p>
