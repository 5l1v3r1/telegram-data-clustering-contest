      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/hong-kong.html">Hong Kong</a> police fired tear gas at pro-democracy protesters in the early hours of Wednesday as demonstrators marked the one-month anniversary of the mask ban.</p>
      <p>Protesters were seen setting up makeshift barricades in Tseung Kwan O, a residential area in the city, where early on Monday, a university student reportedly fell off an upper floor of a carpark building after police fired tear gas.</p>
      <p>Hospital officials said on Tuesday the student was fighting for his life.</p>
      <p>Police could not immediately provide details.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said investigations would be carried out to determine exactly what happened, and that the case drove home the government's message that violence must cease.</p>
      <p>Late on Wednesday, China's Vice Premier Han Zheng said Beijing supports more aggressive measures to tackle the unrest that has roiled the city.Â </p>
      <p>Han said the protests were damaging the "one country, two systems" formula under which the Asian financial hub has been governed since its handover from Britain to Beijing in 1997.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations began in the autonomous Chinese city over a since-scrapped extradition bill and escalated in mid-June.</p>
      <p>Protesters have kept up their calls for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police behaviour, among other demands.</p>
      <p>While the number of people who take part in the mostly weekend rallies has dwindled from the millions who participated in June, the violence and vandalism have escalated.</p>
      <p>Authorities have refused permits for many recent protests, making them illegal from the outset and activists liable to be arrested.</p>
      <p>The past five months of anti-government protests in the former British colony represent the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/xi-jinping.html">Xi Jinping</a>'s government since he took over leadership in late 2012.</p>
      <p>Protesters are angry at China's perceived meddling with Hong Kong's freedoms, including its legal system, since the Asian financial hub returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies the accusation.</p>
