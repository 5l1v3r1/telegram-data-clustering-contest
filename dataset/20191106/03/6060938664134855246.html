      <h1>Chelsea, Ajax draw Champions League thriller as Liverpool win and Barcelona held</h1>

      <p>PARIS: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jorginho">Jorginho</a> scored two penalties as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chelsea">Chelsea</a> came roaring back from 4-1 down to draw 4-4 with nine-man <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajax">Ajax</a> in a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/uefa-champions-league">Champions League</a> classic on Tuesday, while holders <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Liverpool">Liverpool</a> claimed a narrow victory and a stuttering Barcelona were held.</p>
      <p>There was also a rousing comeback win for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Borussia-Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> over <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Inter-Milan">Inter Milan</a> and a big success for Valencia, but the greatest drama came at Stamford Bridge.</p>

      <p>Ajax appeared to be heading for a stunning victory when Hakim Ziyech set up Donny van de Beek to put them 4-1 ahead 10 minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Before that, Jorginho quickly levelled from the spot after Tammy Abraham's own goal gave the Dutch champions a second-minute lead, but a Quincy Promes header and a Kepa Arrizabalaga own goal made it 3-1 at the break.</p>
      <p>After conceding again, Cesar Azpilicueta poked in from close range for Chelsea to pull it back to 4-2, and then came the crazy moment midway through the second half which really gave them hope.</p>
      <p>In one fell swoop, Italian referee Gianluca Rocchi sent off Ajax's Daley Blind and dismissed Joel Veltman for a second caution for a handball in the box seconds later. Jorginho then converted the resulting penalty.</p>
      <p>Teenager Reece James made it 4-4, and Chelsea thought they had gone in front when Azpilicueta fired in, but that goal was disallowed for an Abraham handball.</p>

      <p>"I can't explain the game. For all the things we might analyse back, the madness of the game, we are here for entertainment I suppose and anyone who watched that has to say what a game of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/delhi-dynamos">football</a>. Respect to Ajax, what a spectacle," Chelsea boss Frank Lampard told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>The result means Ajax, Chelsea and Valencia are level on seven points atop Group H, with the Spaniards coming from behind to beat Lille 4-1.</p>
      <p>Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen put Lille ahead at half-time, but Dani Parejo's penalty restored parity and Valencia then scored three times in the last eight minutes.</p>
      <p>Adama Soumaoro's own goal was followed by a stunning Geoffrey Kondogbia strike and a Ferran Torres effort. Lille are eliminated.</p>
      <p>Liverpool won 4-1 in Genk two weeks ago and looked on course for another comfortable victory against the Belgians when Georginio Wijnaldum gave them the lead at Anfield.</p>

      <p>However, with manager Jurgen Klopp resting several players ahead of this weekend's clash with Manchester City, the reigning European champions were pegged back.</p>
      <p>Tanzanian striker Mbwana Ally Samatta headed Genk level before the interval, and it took a fine strike by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to win the game.</p>
      <p>"The plan was to win the game and we did that, so job done," admitted Klopp.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are top of Group E, a point above Napoli, who could have qualified for the last 16 with a win against Salzburg but were held to a 1-1 draw.</p>
      <p>Erling Braut Haaland's early penalty -- the 19-year-old's seventh Champions League goal this season -- gave Salzburg the lead, before Hirving Lozano equalised.</p>
      <p>In Germany, Inter looked to be heading for a second straight win against Dortmund as they raced into a 2-0 half-time lead with Lautaro Martinez and Matias Vecino scoring.</p>

      <p>Yet Dortmund fought back in the second half to win the game as Achraf Hakimi grabbed a brace either side of a Julian Brandt goal.</p>
      <p>It is a result that leaves Dortmund second in Group F, three points ahead of Inter and one behind Barcelona, who are still top despite a 0-0 draw at home to Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi almost scored one of his finest goals, hitting the woodwork at the end of an exhilarating run in the first half.</p>
      <p>Barcelona had not failed to score in a home Champions League group game in seven years and this result followed a shock weekend defeat at Levante.</p>

      <p>"We haven't been convincing, either on Saturday or today, and we know there is a lot of pressure now on the team. We have to respond," said coach Ernesto Valverde.</p>
      <p>RB Leipzig top Group G after goals by Diego Demme and Marcel Sabitzer gave the Germans a 2-0 win at Zenit Saint Petersburg.</p>
      <p>Lyon are two points behind them in second following a 3-1 defeat of Benfica.</p>
      <p>Joachim Andersen and Bertrand Traore scored for Lyon either side of a goal from Memphis Depay, who has now netted in all four Champions League games this season. Haris Seferovic scored for Benfica.</p>
