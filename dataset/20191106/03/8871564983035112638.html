      <h1>15 killed in suspected rebel attacks in Yala: Thai military</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T03:11:34+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 03:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>At least fifteen people were killed and another four injured in attacks by suspected Muslim rebels in Thailand’s violence-wracked south, an army spokesman said on Wednesday, the largest death toll in years.</p>
      <p>The Malay-Muslim south has been in the grip of a bloody insurgency that has killed more than 7,000 people over the last 15 years.</p>
      <p>Late Tuesday militants struck two checkpoints in Yala province manned by civil defence volunteers, opening fire on them as a group of villagers stopped to talk, southern army spokesman Pramote Prom-in told AFP.</p>
      <p>“Twelve were killed at the scene, two more (died) at the hospital, and one died this morning,” said Pramote, adding that the rebels took M-16 rifles and shotguns from the checkpoints.</p>
      <p>The areas surrounding the checkpoints have been closed off and are currently under forensic investigation, he said.</p>
      <p>Rebels seeking autonomy for the culturally distinct region bordering Malaysia have been fighting the Buddhist-majority Thai state, which colonised the area over a century ago.</p>
      <p>The grinding conflict is characterised by tit-for-tat attacks that usually target symbols of the Thai state and its security forces but civilians from both Muslim and Buddhist communities often get caught in the crossfire.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s attack marked the largest coordinated effort “in a very long time”, said Don Pathan, an expert on the so-called “deep south”.</p>
      <p>The incidents have been fewer in recent years, but the hits have been “more intense”.</p>
      <p>“It is a reminder that they are still here,” Pathan said.</p>
      <p>The rebels accuse the state of railroading their distinct culture as well as carrying out routine abuses which go unpunished.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s violence comes months after the death of a Muslim man, Abdulloh Esormusor, who was left in a coma after being interrogated at a notorious Thai detention centre.</p>
      <p>Suspects are routinely taken for interrogation and held under emergency laws in detention centres where rights groups have documented torture.</p>
      <p>Days after Abdulloh’s detention, four people were killed in a late-night attack on a military outpost, fuelling speculation of a retaliatory operation.</p>
      <p>A week later several small bombs exploded in Bangkok, injuring four people as the city hosted a major summit attended by top diplomats, including US secretary of state Mike Pompeo.</p>
      <p>Thailand has linked the bombs to southern insurgents and said the devices used were similar to those found in the south — though no group ever claimed responsibility in the attacks.</p>
