      <h1>Hunt for vandal targeting cars in Keyham and Ford</h1>
      <h2>Victims are waking up to find their cars sprays, scratched and tyres stabbed</h2>

      <p>A vandal who has been targeting cars in Keyham and Ford over the past month and a half is being hunted by police.</p>
      <p>Investigators say several vehicles have been hit in the two areas during the last six weeks, with the culprit sometimes repeatedly vandalising cars.</p>
      <p>Some victims have revealed their cars have suffered scratches, being scrawled over with black marker pens and sprayed with a red paint, often two or three times within hours of each attack.</p>
      <p>Others have had their car tyres slashed or stabbed with a sharp implement.</p>

      <p>One female victim told Plymouth Live that their car was repeatedly vandalised in Alfred Road, leaving them fearful that they were being personally sought out by the suspect.</p>
      <p>She suffered the first attack on September 21 and has since seen her car, a white Fiat 500, hit several more times, with tyres slashed, bodywork scratched or marked or painted on.</p>

      <p>Police believe there may be more victims in those areas, but they have yet to come forward because they have even passed it off as a one-off or have been able to wipe clean their vehicles - particularly those where a red paint has been used - and decided not to report it as a criminal damage.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman has told Plymouth Live the attacks appear to have taken place "predominantly" at night and have been focused in the Keyham and Ford areas.</p>

      <p>They say they are very keen to hear from anyone who has been spotted acting suspicious in these areas during the evenings and appear to be loitering around vehicles.</p>
