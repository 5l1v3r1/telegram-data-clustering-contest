      <p>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) â€” A North Carolina police officer who happened to be at a hospital for an investigation intervened in a struggle Wednesday between a deputy and a suspect who was trying to take his gun. The suspect was killed and the deputy was injured, authorities said.</p>
      <p>A deputy had taken the suspect to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center for medical attention, Cumberland County Sheriff Ennis Wright said at a news conference Wednesday. While there, the suspect tried to take the deputy's gun, Wright said.</p>
      <p>"Luckily, one of the Fayetteville PD's officers was there to help subdue the subject," Wright said.</p>
      <p>The Fayetteville Police Department said in a tweet that the officer "ran to assist the deputy." The officer was at the hospital for another investigation, police Chief Gina Hawkins said.</p>
      <p>The suspect, who had been arrested Tuesday night on charges involving a home invasion, was killed, authorities said, while the deputy suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Wright described the deputy as being in good condition.</p>
      <p>The struggle began about 8:20 a.m. Wednesday in the emergency department, Hawkins said.</p>
      <p>The State Bureau of Investigation will handle the investigation since the suspect was killed in an officer-involved shooting, Hawkins said. Authorities have not released the names of the officer, deputy or suspect.</p>
