      <p>SAN DIEGO, Cali. -- Two murder suspects who escaped from a Northern California jail <a href="https://www.10news.com/news/northern-california-murder-suspects-captured-in-mexico-after-jail-escape">were captured at the San Ysidro Port of Entry</a> , the largest land border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana.</p>
      <p>Suspects Jonathan Salazar and Santos Fonseca escaped from a Monterey County detention facility on Nov. 3 after authorities said the men exploited a “blind spot” in jail security.</p>
      <p>The men cut a hole through a bathroom ceiling, climbed through and then arrived at a back door that they kicked open.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Customs and Border Protection officials say Salazar, 20, and Fonseca, 21, attempted to re-enter the U.S. from Mexico at the port of entry’s PedWest facility late Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Officers learned through database searches that the men were wanted for the jail escape and apprehended them.</p>
      <p>The men were transferred to Monterey County Sheriff’s Department custody.</p>
      <p>Salazar and Fonseca had been in custody since 2018, and both were awaiting trial on murder charges in separate cases.</p>
