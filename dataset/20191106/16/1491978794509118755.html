        <i>Inflation, droughts and power cuts are causing ‘a real crisis of existence’, demonstrators say</i>
      </p>
      <p>Civil servants in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> are demanding higher pay as economic conditions in the southern African country continue to deteriorate.</p>
      <p>Growing discontent in the public sector is a further challenge to the government of President <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmerson-mnangagwa">Emmerson Mnangagwa</a> as it struggles to battle soaring inflation, collapsing confidence in the country’s multiple currencies, the effects of an acute drought and rolling power cuts.</p>
      <p>A small group of civil servants marched in Harare, the capital, on Wednesday. Authorities allowed the demonstration but deployed a heavy police presence.</p>
      <p>Organisers of the protest talked about “a real crisis of existence”.</p>
      <p>David Dzatsunga, the secretary general of the Apex Council, a grouping of government workers’ unions representing 230,000 employees, said civil servants should be described as “civil slaves”.</p>
      <p>“No matter what happens, we have made a statement as civil servants [today] that we are dying and we are dying slowly,” he said. “Even others who were supposed to march with us in solidarity cannot come. I don’t know what we should do. I think our conversations must now be around what is it we should do as workers in this country. Our situation is dire.”</p>
      <p>Inflation in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> has reached 175% and basic goods – including food and medicine – are increasingly rare. Fuel prices have quadrupled since the start of the year.</p>
      <p>Obert Masaraure, leader of Artuz, which represents rural teachers, said that many of his union’s members earned less than US$40 (£31) per month, barely enough to buy flour, sugar and cooking oil for a family of four.</p>
      <p>“Our members are severely incapacitated. They can’t afford the basics,” Masaraure said.</p>
      <p>Mnangagwa took power after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/harare-reacts-robert-mugabe-death-zimbabwe-legacy-misrule">Robert Mugabe</a>, the former president, was ousted in a military takeover nearly two years ago.</p>
      <p>Mnangagwa, a former spy chief, won a disputed election in 2018 with a pledge to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/21/millions-face-hardship-as-zimbabwe-comes-close-to-meltdown">revive the economy</a>, tackle widespread corruption and end the country’s international isolation.</p>
      <p>The government has launched a series of initiatives aimed at bolstering the economy, and earlier this week the Zimbabwe anti-corruption commission (Zacc) detained a cabinet minister for abuse of office alleged to have cost the government $3.7m. Officials at the commission said further arrests could be expected.</p>
      <p>However, Mnangagwa has been either unable or unwilling to push through measures that might have convinced investors and multilateral institutions to provide the funds to resuscitate the economy.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party, said <a href="https://nehandaradio.com/2019/11/06/joram-gumbo-arrest-political-game-churches/">the graft charges were a ‘publicity stunt’</a>.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to break a strike by medical staff, who also want a pay rise, the government fired 77 doctors earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Piers Pigou, an expert at the International Crisis Group, said the move was aimed at making clear that protest would have consequences.</p>
      <p>“There’s a fear factor involved. The government clampdown on doctors is intended to send a message. People are hunkering down. It’s all survival at the moment,” Pigou said.</p>
      <p>Many of the economic problems are a legacy of decades of mismanagement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/28/mugabe-buried-in-low-key-ceremony-as-family-snub-national-plans">under Mugabe, who died in September.</a></p>
      <p>The rising prices reminded many of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/zimbabwe">economic collapse a decade ago</a>, when hyperinflation emptied shelves of basic foodstuffs and led the country to abandon its currency.</p>
      <p>In January, Mnangagwa announced an increase in fuel prices of more than 100%, triggering widespread protests that left at least 17 people dead and scores injured when soldiers opened fire on the strikers.</p>
      <p>The situation in rural areas is particularly bad, aid workers in Zimbabwe said, though there is growing evidence of widespread malnutrition in cities too.</p>
      <p>A government document early this year said about 7.5 million people – about half of the country’s population – in both rural and urban areas would require emergency food aid between February 2019 and March next year.</p>
