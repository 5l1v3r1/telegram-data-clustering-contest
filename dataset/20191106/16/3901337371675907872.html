      <p>Despite their precarious position on the Absa Premiership log, Baroka FC seem to be oozing with confidence ahead of tonight’s match against Mamelodi Sundowns.</p>
      <p>Bakgaga will host Downs at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in an important match for the Limpopo outfit, after winning only two of the nine matches played so far in the campaign. </p>

      <p>Baroka are in 14th place on the log with only eight points out of a possible 27. The team’s head coach Wedson Nyirenda has been linked with an exit in recent weeks, due to the poor run of form.</p>
      <p>Despite all of that, there is a celebration currently underway at the Limpopo outfit, with the club ecstatic about playing their 100th match in Mzansi’s top-flight, since their promotion in 2016 under charismatic coach Kgoloko Thobejane.        </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Downs still have a number of players currently with injuries – with the likes of Oupa Manyisa, Anthony Laffor, Lucky Mohomi, Emiliano Tade, Themba Zwane, Phakamani Mahlambi and Gaston Sirino all expected to miss the Baroka match.     </p>
