        <i>Late-night hosts discussed the refreshed testimony from Gordon Sondland and Donald Trump’s latest rally performance</i>
      </p>
      <p>Late-night hosts addressed the shifting testimony from Gordon Sondland and Trump’s latest instance of bragging at a rally.</p>
      <h3>Jimmy Kimmel: ‘They’re very effective against perjury’</h3>
      <p>The host of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live started by covering Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. Sondland’s original testimony on allegations that Trump demanded a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, represented a denial – but Sondland now claims his memory has changed.</p>
      <p>“I wonder what jogged his memory?” Kimmel asked. “Maybe he started taking those omega-3 supplements. They say they’re very effective against perjury.”</p>

      <p>He then played footage of Trump showing off at a rally, recounting compliments from Lou Dobbs, who reportedly claimed he was the greatest president of all time. “Can you imagine anyone else in the world talking like that?” he asked. “Stroking themselves so vigorously in front of other people. It’s crazy. We have a crazy person running our country.”</p>
      <p>Trump also claimed he was getting no credit for the recent killing of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and instead the dog involved is getting more praise. “It took three years but our president is finally feuding with a dog,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kimmel also joked about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> Jr’s new book Triggered which is filled with anger toward Obama, liberals and the media. “Basically, for $18 you get to read his father’s Twitter account,” he joked.</p>
      <p>In the book, Don Jr claims his father cannot be racist because as a kid he was allowed to hang out with Michael Jackson. “Nothing says I love my son more than leaving him in a room with Michael Jackson,” Kimmel said.</p>
      <h3>Stephen Colbert: ‘I’m beginning to think this Trump fella might get impeached’</h3>

      <p>On The Late Show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> started by saying: “I’m beginning to think this Donald Trump fella might get impeached.”</p>
      <p>He then also brought up Sondland’s latest testimony. “The evidence is pretty damning in that it’s exactly what we already knew,” Colbert said, before claiming this should be “game, set, match” for the inquiry over Trump’s behaviour.</p>
      <p>Colbert shared information that Jay Leno was reportedly at a dinner with Zelenskiy and Jared Kushner as the Ukrainian president is a big fan of his work. “I’m just being told that Jay Leno is the new president of Ukraine,” he joked. “Sorry Conan, better luck next time!”</p>
      <p>New reports have also suggested that Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, was worried about being fired by tweet by Trump. “There’s nothing worse than being fired by tweet. Except maybe getting divorced by Snapchat,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Trevor Noah: ‘I thought you said squid pro quo’</h3>

      <p>On The Daily Show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/trevor-noah">Trevor Noah</a> also spoke about Sondland’s updated testimony. “We can’t even edit our tweets, but this guy’s walking into Congress like, ‘Oh, you guys said quid pro quo! I thought you said squid pro quo,’” he joked.</p>
      <p>Noah continued: “I feel bad for Sondland, because he was the first to testify and he probably thought everyone was gonna have his back and say there was no quid pro quo. But then instead everyone snitched on him.”</p>
      <h3>Seth Meyers: ‘A 40-year-old waiting to be picked up from soccer’</h3>

      <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers also covered Sondland. “If that’s something you just remembered then think of all the small stuff you’re forgetting,” he said. “Somewhere there’s a 40-year-old man still waiting to be picked up from soccer.”</p>
      <p>He moved on to Trump’s rally which saw him stand in front of supporters wearing ‘Read the testimony’ T-shirts. “I get the feeling they didn’t bring them from home,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meyers also joked about Donald Trump Jr’s new book Triggered which he said was almost called Dad, Do You Love Me Yet? before also mentioning his Michael Jackson anecdote. “‘That guy always creeped me out,’ said Michael Jackson,” he quipped.</p>
