      <p>Fears of hepatitis A swirled in Somerville, New Jersey, this week, after the <a href="https://www.co.somerset.nj.us/Home/Components/News/News/3438/17">health department there reported</a> that a food handler in a local grocery store could have exposed shoppers to the infectious disease.</p>
      <p>New Jersey's current hepatitis A outbreak, which began in 2018, has swelled to 504 cases as of early November.</p>
      <p>It's also part of an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm">ongoing nationwide outbreak</a> of the infectious disease, which began in 2016 and has led to 27,634 infections and 16,679 hospitalizations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>Hepatitis A, a highly contagious liver infection that's typically spread by coming in contact with feces from a person already infected, has killed 275 people in 30 states from 2016 through Nov. 1.</p>

      <p>Despite the New Jersey grocery store incident, and contrary to what many people believe, most people don't contract the disease from contaminated food or water.</p>
      <p>Instead, hepatitis A tends to be spread person-to-person, with the vast majority of infections occurring among people who are homeless or inject drugs, or among men who have sex with men.</p>
      <p>California's 2016 to 2018 outbreak, for example, spread primarily among homeless encampments along the coastline, prompting then-Gov. Jerry Brown to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hepatitis-california-outbreak-triggers-state-emergency/story?id=50513882">declare a state of emergency</a>.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of the disease include fatigue, sudden nausea and vomiting, dark urine, clay-colored stool and jaundice, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-a/symptoms-causes/syc-20367007">according to the Mayo Clinic</a>. Unlike hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which also affect the liver, hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease, and is not typically fatal.</p>
      <p>The best defense against the disease is thorough hand-washing or getting the hepatitis A vaccine, which is 95% effective and lasts for 11 years.</p>
