      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A jury was seated on Wednesday in the trial of President Donald Trump’s adviser Roger Stone, a court official said, setting the stage for opening arguments in a criminal case stemming from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old veteran Republican political operative - a self-described “dirty trickster” and “agent provocateur” - has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing justice, witness tampering and lying to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Stone has been a friend and ally of Trump for some 40 years.</p>
