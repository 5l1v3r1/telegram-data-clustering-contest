          <b><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Facebook</a> is the largest social media service on the planet, with over 2 billion users — over a quarter of the world's population.</b>
        </li>
        <li>As such, policing Facebook is a tremendous challenge. One of the service's biggest policing issues is with fake news stories, which was a particularly big problem in the US during the 2016 presidential election cycle.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Despite Facebook's efforts to stop the spread of fake news, the massive social media service is still rife with it: In 2019, the top 100 fake news stories on Facebook were viewed over 150 million times — "enough to reach every registered voter at least once," according to Avaaz, the non-profit that did the study.</b>

      <p>In 2019, many <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Facebook</a> users saw news posts that claimed President Donald Trump's grandfather was, "a pimp and tax evader," and that his father was a member of the KKK — none of which is true.</p>
      <p>Facebook's 2 billion-plus users also had access to a post claiming that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed a ban on motorcycles (she didn't), and that House speaker Nancy Pelosi was diverting Social Security funding for the Trump impeachment inquiry (she wasn't). </p>
      <p>These are just a few of the most-shared political fake news stories of 2019, according to a new study from the non-profit Avaaz. The top 100 fake news stories on Facebook in 2019 were viewed over 150 million times — "enough to reach every registered voter at least once," according to the report. </p>
      <p>Here are the top 10 fake-news stories of 2019:</p>
