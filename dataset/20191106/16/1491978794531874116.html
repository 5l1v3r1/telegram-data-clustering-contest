        <i>Erdoğan decries US for ‘communications campaign’ over jihadist’s death</i>
      </p>
      <p>A woman married to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-isis-leader-killed-us-donald-trump">slain Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> has been captured and is in Turkish custody, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said.</p>
      <p>Erdoğan made the announcement during a speech in Ankara on Wednesday but did not provide any further details. “The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel,” Erdogan said, criticising the US for a “communications campaign” over the jihadist’s death.</p>
      <p>“But, I am announcing it here for the first time: we captured his wife and didn’t make a fuss like them. Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother-in-law in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a>.”</p>
      <p>It is not clear when or how the unidentified woman was arrested by Turkish forces, but Ankara said earlier this week it had captured several of the jihadist’s relatives, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/sister-of-killed-isis-leader-captured-says-turkish-official">including his elder sister Rasmiya Awad</a>, in the northern Syrian town of Azaz, in Aleppo province.</p>
      <p>The Isis leader blew himself and three children up in a tunnel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/nowhere-left-to-run-how-the-us-finally-caught-up-with-isis-leader-baghdadi">after US special forces </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/nowhere-left-to-run-how-the-us-finally-caught-up-with-isis-leader-baghdadi">entered his heavily-fortified compound in Syria’s Idlib province</a> during a raid on 26 October.</p>

      <p>According to Baghdadi’s brother-in-law Muhammad Ali Sajid, who is in Iraqi custody, he had four wives when he last met him in the summer of 2018 – the maximum allowed under Islamic law. It is not clear if any of his wives were present during the US attack.</p>
      <p>One of the women is an Iraqi known as Nour, the daughter of one of his aides. At one point, Baghdadi was also believed to be married to a German teenager, but she was reported to have fled his house in 2016.</p>
      <p>Ex-wife Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi national, also left him in 2009 while pregnant. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/al-baghdadi-wife-son-arrest-lebanon-fake-passport">She was arrested in Lebanon in 2014</a> and freed a year later in an al-Qaida<b> </b>prisoner swap.</p>
      <p>Awad was reportedly arrested in a trailer on Monday in a part of north-west Syria under Turkish control, along with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children.</p>
      <p>Turkish officials claim she possesses valuable intelligence regarding Isis operations. It was not immediately clear if her capture produced intelligence that led to the capture of the unidentified wife.</p>
      <p>The US raid on Baghdadi’s compound was a major blow to the extremist group, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/23/isis-defeated-us-backed-syrian-democratic-forces-announce">lost control of its last slivers of territory in Syria</a> in March this year.</p>
      <p>Isis has since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/islamic-state-new-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-abu-ibrahim-al-hashimi-al-qurayshi">announced </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/islamic-state-new-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-abu-ibrahim-al-hashimi-al-qurayshi">Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi as Baghdadi’s successor</a>, but little is known about him. Intelligence officials believe the name is a nom de guerre</p>
