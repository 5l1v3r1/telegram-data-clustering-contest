      <p>The Los Angeles artist is set to release her <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/poppy-announces-new-album-disagree-releases-title-track-2553876">third album ‘I Disagree</a>‘ in January, and has already previewed the project with its title track and ‘Concrete’.

      <p>Now, Poppy has shared another glimpse at the upcoming LP with the twisted sounds of ‘Bloodmoney’. “<i>What do you believe when everyone is watching/ What do you believe when nobody is watching</i>,” Poppy asks at the top of the track, which contains eardrum-rupturing bass and heavy drums.</p>
      <p>With the track carrying religious themes throughout, the accompanying video sees Poppy – dressed in an all-white – standing in front of a red neon crucifix before ascending into the air. Elsewhere, she furiously battles with a number of figures donning black boilersuits.</p>
