      <p>"Officers are at the scene along with the Kent Fire and Rescue Service and ambulance crews, and are offering assistance where needed."</p>
      <p>Self-employed businessman Richard Hurley, 32, is at Maidstone Hospital and told <a href="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/maidstone/news/57-treated-after-chemical-leak-215719/">Kent Online</a> the scene looked like a "complete lockdown".</p>
      <p>He told the website: "Nobody is being allowed into the hospital and big white hazard tents have been set up outside.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of activity, I'd describe it as a full-scale operation.</p>
      <p>"I can see five police cars, a couple of vans and now there are quite a few ambulances queuing up."</p>
      <p>An air ambulance was reportedly called to the scene alongside other emergency services.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said: “Our hospital sites are currently preparing for the arrival of a number of patients who are experiencing breathing difficulties following a suspected chemical incident in Maidstone.</p>
      <p>”As a precautionary measure a hazardous materials tent has been erected outside the emergency department to help us manage those patients.</p>
      <p>“While our Emergency Departments (EDs) are open as normal, we would encourage people to only use our EDs for emergency and life-threatening situations during this period to help us focus our resources on those who need it most.”</p>
      <p>An ambulance spokesman said: "We are responding to an incident in Sutton Road, Langley near Maidstone, following a suspected chemical leak at a premises reported to us at approximately 2.20pm today.</p>
      <p>"Ambulance crews, including our Hazardous Area Response Team and the air ambulance service, are at the scene.</p>
      <p>"We have assessed and treated 57 people at the scene for breathing difficulties.</p>
      <p>"A number have been discharged from our care.</p>
      <p>"No patients are currently in a serious condition."</p>
