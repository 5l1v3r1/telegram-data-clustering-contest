      <p>A member of the U.S. Air Force went missing during a training jump over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday. The Air Force <a href="https://www.airforcespecialtactics.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2010351/update-search-ongoing-for-special-tactics-airman-after-training-jump/">said in a statement</a> Wednesday that crews were still searching for the airman.</p>
      <p>The Air Force said the airman "departed a C-130 aircraft" Tuesday morning over the Gulf of Mexico about 4 miles south of a military base in the Florida Panhandle. On Wednesday, crews have been searching a 700 square-mile area off the coast of the Panhandle between Fort Walton Beach and Pensacola.</p>
      <p>The unidentified airman is with the Air Force's special operations force — known as <a href="https://www.airforcespecialtactics.af.mil/About/Special-Tactics/">Special Tactics</a> — from the 24th Special Operations Wing based at <a href="https://www.hurlburt.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheets/Article/204585/hurlburt-field/">Hurlburt Field</a>, which is the headquarters for Air Force Special Operations Command.</p>
      <p>The Air Force, Coast Guard and the Army were involved in the search, the Air Force said. The incident was under investigation.</p>
