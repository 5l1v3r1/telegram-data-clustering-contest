      <p>It's never too early to grab a bargain, even if they're Christmas bargains and we're only in November.</p>
      <p>EE's <a href="https://shop.ee.co.uk/christmas-deals">early bird Christmas deals</a> are throwing in a free 43” Toshiba Ultra HD 4K TV or Nintendo Switch with select handsets, as long as you nab them before November 25.</p>
      <p>Here's the list of shiny new phones you can get with your freebie on EE's pay monthly plans:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Samsung A80 – £44 per month (£50 upfront cost) on a 10GB Essentials Plan</li>
        <li>Samsung A70 – £39 per month (no upfront cost) on a 10GB Essentials Plan</li>
        <li>Samsung A40 – £31 per month (no upfront cost) on a 10GB Essentials Plan</li>
        <li>Huawei P30 Pro – £59 per month (£50 upfront cost) on a 10GB Essentials Plan</li>

      </ul>
      <p>EE is also offering pay monthly deals on accessories and consoles, spreading the cost over 11 months. The catch is you need to have signed up for a 24-month handset plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Xbox One S All Digital Edition with 3 x games (Minecraft, Forza Horizon 3 and Sea of Thieves) - £17 a month with a £12 upfront cost</li>
        <li>PlayStation 4 Bundle with additional controller - £25 a month with no upfront cost</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch v1.1 (2019 edition) - £30 a month with no upfront cost</li>
        <li>Apple AirPods 2nd Gen - £14 a month, no upfront cost and comes with a £20 audio and Smart Home voucher</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're an existing customer and are within the first 17 months of your contract, you can also grab yourself one of these deals.</p>
      <p>SIM only customers get a Christmas treat too, with triple data for six months. You can check out all of the available offers on <a href="https://shop.ee.co.uk/add-to-plan/xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition?CTTag=CT_Sal_XmasCampaignPage_XBox1S_Q1_2019">EE's website</a>, but with Black Friday sales on the horizon, you may want to wait until the tail end of the promotional period before committing to anything.</p>
