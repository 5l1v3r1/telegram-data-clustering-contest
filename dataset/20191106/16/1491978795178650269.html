      <p>My brother Dan Lobb, who has died aged 80, was a designer of optical instruments for spacecraft, working at the<a href="https://www.csagroupuk.org/about/our-history/"> Scientific Instrument Research Association</a> (Sira) in Chislehurst, Kent, from the 1960s onwards.</p>
      <p>Early on in his career, he became a designer of laser projector-based flight simulators, and spent a year in the US working at the <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil/">Naval Research Laboratory</a>, in Washington. Then, in the 80s Sira began developing optical instruments for space satellites, mainly for the <a href="https://www.esa.int/">European Space Agency (ESA)</a>. As an inventor of uniquely clever designs, a driver of computer analyses to optimise the shapes of the lenses and mirrors, and a very good physicist and mathematician, Dan was central to the work.</p>
      <p>One of his designs, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576599002076">CHRIS</a> (Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) was intended only as a demonstration model for a one-year mission launched on an experimental satellite in 2001, but is still flying today, providing research data for environmental scientists worldwide.</p>
      <p>In the last three decades, Dan became the pre-eminent designer of imaging spectrometers, which enable the measurement of environmental properties such as crop health, water quality and atmospheric pollution.</p>
      <p>Born in Ilford, east London, five months before the outbreak of the second world war, Dan was one of four sons of Mary (nee Davey), a skilled potter, and Richard Lobb, an insurance clerk who enjoyed painting. Fearing the arrival of enemy bombs, the family moved out to Bookham and then Fetcham in Surrey.</p>
      <p>Dan went to Dorking grammar school and then to Imperial College London to study physics. He did well and went on to a postgraduate year for a diploma in optics, before his career began, in 1962, at Sira. There he met Pat Openshaw, who worked at Sira as a librarian. They married in 1968 and settled nearby. Dan shone at Sira: in optics, he had discovered his true metier.</p>
      <p>After Sira closed down in 2006, its space team joined Surrey Satellite Technology (SSTL), a company specialising in small, inexpensive satellites built quickly, often for developing countries. Dan’s inventive designs enabled the company to develop instruments that rivalled the performance of those from larger competitors.</p>
      <p>His work for the ESA’s environmental monitoring programmes included imaging spectrometers for the mapping of atmospheric pollution (Sentinel-5 Precursor) and photosynthesis in vegetation (Flex). A recent major achievement was his design of a complex field splitter for Nasa’s flagship astronomy satellite the <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb Space Telescope</a> – comprising 97 mirrors in an instrument the size of a hand.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Dan received a Royal Aeronautical Society award for specialist contributions in aerospace.</p>
      <p>Dan, a big man both physically and intellectually, with a lovely sense of humour, was dedicated to his family. He is survived by Pat, their children, Jane, Toby and Andrew, and by his brothers, James, Andrew and me.</p>
