      <p>Lady Gaga has said her Oscars performance with Bradley Cooper was "orchestrated" to look as if they were in love.</p>
      <p>The A Star Is Born co-stars set tongues wagging after they performed an intense version of the film's hit song Shallow at the Academy Awards this year.</p>
      <p>But Gaga told Elle magazine that the pair "mapped the whole thing out".</p>
      <p>Speaking to guest interviewer Oprah Winfrey, she said: "Quite frankly, I think the press is very silly.</p>
      <p>"I mean, we made a love story.</p>
      <p>"For me, as a performer and as an actress, of course we wanted people to believe that we were in love.</p>

      <p>"And we wanted people to feel that love at the Oscars.</p>
      <p>"We wanted it to go right through the lens of that camera and to every television that it was being watched on.</p>
      <p>"And we worked hard on it, we worked for days."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The singer, 33, went on: "We mapped the whole thing out - it was orchestrated as a performance.</p>
      <p>"In truth, when we talked about it, we went, 'Well, I guess we did a good job!"'</p>
      <p>Discussing Ally, her character from the film, Gaga said she "had to relive a lot of my career doing that role".</p>

      <p>And she said when she looked at the Oscar that Shallow won (for best original song), she "saw pain".</p>
      <p>She said: "I film it as living the character, and it's a moment in my life, so I relived it all again, and it took a long time for it to go away.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"When I won the Oscar for Shallow, I looked at it, and a reporter asked me, 'When you look at that Oscar, what do you see?' And I said, 'I see a lot of pain.'</p>
      <p>"And I wasn't lying in that moment. I was raped when I was 19 years-old, repeatedly.</p>
      <p>"I have been traumatised in a variety of ways by my career over the years from many different things, but I survived, and I've kept going.</p>
      <p>"And when I looked at that Oscar, I saw pain. I don't know that anyone understood it when I said it in the room, but I understood it."</p>
