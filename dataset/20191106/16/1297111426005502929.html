      <p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders can be proud of their 2019 report card.</p>
      <p>The Riders finished with a 13-5 record after opening the CFL season at 1-3. Saskatchewan clinched first place in the West Division for the first time since 2009 and that accomplishment contributed to the overall A grade.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan earned a bye to the division final on Nov. 17 and will host the winner of Sunday’s West Division semifinal between the Calgary Stampeders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
      <p>Here’s how the Riders grade out, position by position, following the regular season:</p>

        <b>PLAYER PERSONNEL</b>
      </p>
      <p>General manager Jeremy O’Day deserves a high grade for signing Fajardo to a free-agent contract and later to a two-year extension. O’Day also bolstered the Riders with free-agent signings like Powell, Johnson, Leonard and receivers Cory Watson and Manny Arceneaux. <b>GRADE</b>: A.</p>
