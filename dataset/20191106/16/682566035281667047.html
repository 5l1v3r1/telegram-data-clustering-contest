          <b>Boardroom fights, clashing egos - How things unravelled for Benni McCarthy at CT City</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>McCarthy was sacked on Monday after a disastrous spell with the Citizens claiming just two wins in their last 18 league encounters.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Riekerink comes with a vast amount of coaching experience having managed teams such as Ajax Amsterdam, Turkish giants Galatasary and most recently SC Heerenveen.</p>
      <p>"What I can bring to the club is my experience from my years of coaching, Reikerink said. "I hope we achieve results that fit with the ambitions of the club."</p>
      <p>"I'm really proud to be back here and I'm really proud to coach this team."</p>
      <p>The Dutchman is believed to have beat out former Ajax Cape Town head coach Muhsin Ertugral to the job - who was spotted in Cape Town - and has an excellent relationship with CT City boss John Comitis.</p>
