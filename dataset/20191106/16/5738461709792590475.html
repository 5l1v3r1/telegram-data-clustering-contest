        <b>Vinny Perth feels Dundalk FC can show the forward strides made by Irish football in Friday night’s Unite the Union Champions Cup first leg against Linfield (7:45pm).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lilywhites will travel to Windsor Park for the first leg licking their wounds from <a href="https://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/section/161/soccer">Sunday’s painful FAI Cup final loss to Shamrock Rovers</a>, before the return fixture at Oriel Park on Monday.</p>
      <p>Perth touched on the All-Ireland league proposal, which has received a setback in recent days following the IFA’s statement of non-support, when speaking of the Linfield tie.</p>
      <p>“We’re such a professional group and knowing these players... we’ll be back on the training ground, recovering and preparing for what is another big weekend potentially for Irish football.</p>
      <p>“I hope it goes well, the two games against Linfield. I know the All-Ireland league got a setback, but, hopefully, it’s a good game and occasion.</p>
      <p>“A bit like today (FAI Cup final), I think today was a very good occasion for Irish football.</p>
      <p>“On the pitch I think we’ve made great strives for Irish football and League of Ireland, so I think this is another opportunity.”</p>
