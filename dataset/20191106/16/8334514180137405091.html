      <p>Under the agreement, Nio will manufacture and produce at mass scale a self-driving system designed by Mobileye, which will be integrated into Nio’s electric-vehicle consumer lines, as well as Mobileye’s driverless ride-hailing services.</p>
      <p>Shares in Nio surged 23% on the news.</p>
      <p>The self-driving kit provided by Israel-based Mobileye includes the vision processing chip, camera, radar and lidar sensors, as well as safety and mapping software.</p>
      <p>Nio will also develop a version of self-driving electric vehicles that Mobileye will deploy as robotaxis for ride-hailing services in global markets.</p>
      <p>No financial details of the partnership were disclosed.</p>
      <p>The companies plan an initial release in China beginning in 2022, Mobileye President and Chief Executive Officer Amnon Shashua told Reuters in an interview on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The deal with Nio will also enable us to harvest data in compliance with Chinese regulations and improve mapping to support autonomous driving,” Shashua said.</p>
      <p>Shashua said his company also had “strategic partnerships with a number of Chinese carmakers” to work on autonomous cars, without elaborating further.</p>
      <p>The Mobileye CEO added that a rollout in China was more efficient as the regulatory environment was centralized and the Chinese government was working on standardizing Mobileye’s safety model for self-driving cars into law.</p>
      <p>Manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly skeptical about the speed of adoption of fully automated self-driving systems, because of their high cost, complexity, and regulatory hurdles.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, they have begun focusing on deploying more advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), which share components, but cost much less and can generate much-needed revenue to help defray the cost of developing full self-driving systems.</p>
      <p>Mobileye on Tuesday said it powers ADAS in car models of more than 27 automakers.</p>
      <p>Money-losing and cash-burning Nio is the most prominent among dozens of Chinese electric-vehicle startups vying to become the next Tesla Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>). All are hampered by dwindling demand in the world’s largest car market, reduced government subsidies for EVs and nagging concerns over the China-U.S. trade war.</p>
      <p>Nio on Tuesday said the partnership with Mobileye aligned with its mission to provide premium, smart electric cars and allowed it to maintain an edge over electric vehicle competitors.</p>
