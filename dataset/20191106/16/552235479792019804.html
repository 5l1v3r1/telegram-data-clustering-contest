      <p>A brutal murderer who savagely beat his own gran to death was found naked and dead in his prison cell after suffering a burst blood vessel in his brain.</p>
      <p>Callous killer Garry Kane, 47, who was jailed in 2013 for bludgeoning his 87-year-old grandmother to death, died in maximum security prison <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/gangland-hitman-slashed-razor-inmate-20389925">HMP Shotts</a> , Lanarkshire in 2018, five years into a life sentence.</p>
      <p>A fatal accident inquiry heard the former paratrooper was discovered by a female warder at approximately 7.35am in his cell.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Allan McKay, who presided over the probe at Hamilton Sheriff Court, said: "He was naked, lying on the cell floor, and had a fresh laceration to his forehead. He was unresponsive."</p>

      <p>The court heard Prison Officer Natalie Walker rendered first aid. She could not find a pulse and radioed for assistance.</p>
      <p>Two prison nurses battled for 20 minutes but were were unable to find a pulse despite numerous cycles of CPR and Kane was pronounced dead by paramedics.</p>
      <p>A pathologist found Kane had been killed by the spontaneous rupture of a cerebral artery.</p>
      <p>The wound on the left side of his forehead was said to be consistent with his head hitting on a hard surface, such as his stone bedframe, as a result of his "terminal collapse".</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/murderer-jailed-brutally-killing-gran-13320046">His death</a> occurred sometime between prison lockdown at 9pm on the 10th September 2018 and 7.34am on the 11th.</p>
      <p>Sheriff McKay ruled in a written determination: "This was a non-survivable event.</p>
      <p>"Early intervention would not have improved his chances of survival."</p>
      <p>Kane was jailed after murdering his grandmother Kathleen Milward in her home in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire in 2012.</p>
      <p>She had taken him in after he was thrown out by his mother for stealing to buy drugs.</p>

      <p>The High Court in Glasgow heard he argued with the old lady, then hit her over the head with a blunt object at least three times.</p>
      <p>His blows left her skull exposed and he broke a bone in her neck as he throttled her.</p>
      <p>Mrs Milward suffered a total of 26 injuries during the brutal attack. His DNA was found under her nails, showing that she struggled with him for her life.</p>
      <p>Kane went out to buy heroin after the killing.</p>
      <p>Judge Lord Matthews, who ordered him to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sisters-at-war-after-killer-grandson-1530544">serve a minimum of 17 years</a> , told him: "You were found guilty of the murder of your own grandmother. No words of mine can bring home the enormity of that.</p>

      <p>"What made it more heinous was that she was murdered in her own home, where she was entitled to feel safe, in brutal circumstances."</p>
      <p>Lord Matthews said he could only rationalise that the crime was committed because of Kane's "craving" for heroin.</p>
