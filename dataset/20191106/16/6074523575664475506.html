      <p>U.S. prosecutors charged Asa Saint Clair, the president of a nonexistent United Nations affiliate, with fraud Wednesday, alleging he defrauded investors using the IGOBIT digital token.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors with the Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/president-purported-intergovernmental-organization-indicted-cryptocurrency-scheme#_ftn1">alleged</a> that Saint Clair lured investors to buy into the “World Sports Alliance” using his IGOBIT digital currency, promising investors equity the in organization from 2017 to September 2019.</p>
      <p>According to the indictment, IGOBIT was never built, and the project’s investors did not receive the tokens they were promised.</p>
      <p>“As alleged, Asa Saint Clair used World Sports Alliance, a sham affiliate of the United Nations, as a vehicle to defraud lenders,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. “Saint Clair allegedly defrauded investors in IGOBIT, a digital currency he claimed WSA was developing, but which turned out to be the fraudulent bait with which to lure victim investors.”</p>
      <p>Instead, Saint Clair is said to have siphoned off the money for his personal use.</p>
      <p>“Saint Clair allegedly touted his company as promoting the values of sports and peace for a better world, yet defrauded all those who invested in his sham company,” Special Agent-in-Charge Peter Fitzhugh said in a statement. “As alleged, Saint Clair used the money he earned through deceit to fund a lavish lifestyle for him and his family.”</p>
      <p>Saint Clair faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of wire fraud.</p>
      <p>The World Sports Alliance did not immediately respond to CoinDesk request for comment.</p>
