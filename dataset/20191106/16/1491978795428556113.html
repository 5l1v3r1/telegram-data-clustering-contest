      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> has blocked the leftwing campaigner Chris Williamson from standing as a candidate in the general election after he was suspended over accusations he had downplayed antisemitism in the party.</p>
      <p>The MP for Derby North was one of three former Labour MPs who were told they will not stand as candidates following a day-long meeting of the party’s ruling body.</p>
      <p>A decision has not yet been made by the national executive committee (NEC) on the future of the former minister Keith Vaz, who was given an unprecedented <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/keith-vaz-suspended-from-commons-for-six-months">six-month ban from parliament</a> for offering to buy cocaine for sex workers and obstructing inquiries by the standards commissioner.</p>
      <p>He is one of six prospective candidates who will face questions this week from an NEC endorsement panel, consisting of three NEC members, before the party decides whether they can stand.</p>
      <p>It comes amid mounting criticism of the party over its decision to allow Vaz to keep the party’s whip and membership, despite a damning verdict from the Labour-led standards committee.</p>
      <p>Martin Bell, the anti-sleaze campaigner who unseated the scandal-hit Tory MP Neil Hamilton in Tatton in 1997, told the Guardian he would endorse a local independent candidate if Labour chooses to allow Vaz to run.</p>
      <p>“I saw the behaviour of Vaz for myself during a standards and privileges committee inquiry when I was an MP. I think it would be important for someone to take a stand against him if Labour let him run as their candidate,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bell, a former war reporter known for his white suit, stood against Hamilton after the Guardian accused the Tory MP of taking “cash for questions” from Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods.</p>
      <p>Wednesday’s meeting of the NEC was made up of representatives of unions, MPs and party members. It had endorsed about 600 candidates out of 632 by the early evening.</p>
      <p>Williamson was suspended in February after he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/27/chris-williamson-says-labour-has-been-too-apologetic-about-antisemitism-video">recorded on video</a> telling a meeting that Labour had been “too apologetic” over antisemitism allegations that had led to the party being “demonised”.</p>
      <p>He was readmitted to the party and issued with a formal warning after a hearing of an NEC antisemitism panel in June, prompting an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/chris-williamson-back-in-labour-party-after-antisemitism-remarks">outcry from MPs</a>, peers and Jewish groups. He was suspended again in July.</p>
      <p>Labour also imposed a separate suspension on 3 September over additional allegations of misconduct. Last month, Williamson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/10/chris-williamson-loses-legal-bid-over-labour-party-antisemitism-suspension">lost a high court bid</a> to be reinstated to the party.</p>
      <p>The Jarrow MP, Stephen Hepburn, was also kicked off the party’s candidates’ list over allegations of sexual harassment. Hepburn, 59, allegedly targeted a female party member in her 20s at an Indian restaurant 14 years ago, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/exclusive-labour-mp-stephen-hepburn-subject-to-sex-harassment-complaint_uk_5c824ae4e4b0d9361626d678?guccounter=1">according to HuffPost</a>.</p>
      <p>The Labour party has referred the case to its ultimate disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee. Hepburn has previously said he “completely refutes” the allegation.</p>
      <p>Roger Godsiff, the Birmingham Hall Green MP, has also been dropped as a candidate, although he never lost the Labour whip, a source confirmed.</p>
      <p>Godsiff faced a re-selection battle after Labour members demanded a trigger ballot in his constituency following a row over his support for demonstrators against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/31/school-defends-lgbt-lessons-after-religious-parents-complain">LGBT equality lessons</a> in a Birmingham primary school.</p>
      <p>Godsiff declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Hepburn and Williamson have been approached for a comment.</p>
      <p>Diane Abbott was among NEC members calling for Vaz to stand down. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last week: “I think he should consider his position. I think he himself should agree not to be a candidate.”</p>
      <p>Other shadow ministers have told the Guardian that Vaz, himself an NEC member, could become a distraction during what is expected to be a hard-fought election campaign. “Right now, the Tories are seen as the party of sleaze. We don’t need this,” said one.</p>
      <p>However, the NEC has received letters of support from community groups and fellow MPs calling for Vaz to be endorsed as a candidate, informed sources have said. “Keith is like an errant brother. He has not been suspended [by Labour] and therefore it is hard to see on what grounds the party can decide to stop him from standing again,” a senior party source said.</p>
      <p>If Vaz stands and is re-elected, he will be unable to take up his seat until his suspension ends. He could then face a recall petition to give voters in Leicester East the chance to oust him.</p>
      <p>He could face further action from the committee over comments posted to his personal website that appeared to criticise the inquiry report, the Commons was told.</p>
