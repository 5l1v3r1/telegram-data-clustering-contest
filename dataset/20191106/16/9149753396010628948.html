      <p>Who needs to wait until Black Friday in order to get some awesome cheap gaming monitor deals? Microcenter has got one of favorite gaming monitors on sale with the  27-inch ASUS ROG Swift PG279Q at its <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/458071/ROG_Swift_PG279Q_27_WQHD_165Hz_HDMI_DP_G-SYNC_LED_Gaming_Monitor">lowest price ever at $499.99.</a> Nearly $150 dollars off its normal retail price.</p>
      <p>The ROG Swift PG27Q is the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-monitor/">best gaming monitor</a> we've gotten our hands on this year. It comes with a 1440p IPS display, 4ms response time, and 144Hz (overclockable to 165Hz) refresh rate. It's G-sync compatible too, which you'd expect for the price. While it was premium at the list price, the saving you get here makes it very reasonable. At $500 dollars, there really is no reason not the consider picking up this bad boy, especially as it'll last you for several upgrade cycles of your main gaming rig.</p>
