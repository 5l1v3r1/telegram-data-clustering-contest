      <p>This week on the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/indy-football-podcast">Indy Football Podcast</a>, we ask: how much football is too much football?</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/lukedbrown?lang=en">Luke Brown</a></b> is joined by columnist <b><a href="https://twitter.com/TonyEvans92a">Tony Evans</a></b> and sports reporter <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceostlere">Lawrence Ostlere</a></b> to discuss the seemingly endless amount of fixtures.</p>
      <p>They hear from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Liverpool">Liverpool</a> manager Jurgen Klopp and wonder how on earth the Reds will manage playing in two cup competitions on two different continents in such a short period of time.</p>
      <p>The team also discuss the merits of the Fifa <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/club-world-cup">Club World Cup</a>. Is it a serious tournament that should be respected? Or a bit of pointless fun in the mould of the International Champions Cup?</p>
      <p>There is also enough time to talk about the future of international football, England’s domestic cup competitions and for Tony to rant about rugby union. Spoiler alert: He isn’t a great fan.</p>
