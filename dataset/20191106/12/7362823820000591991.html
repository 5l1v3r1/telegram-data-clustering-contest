      <p>Former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> defensive back Jermaine Whitehead apologized Tuesday for threatening fans and the media in the wake of his team’s loss to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a>.</p>
      <p>Whitehead, who the Browns released Monday, said in an Instagram post that there was “no excuse” for his actions and that his outburst was “totally out of character for me.”</p>

      <p>“I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for my actions following our game with Denver. That was totally out of character for me. I do not justify my actions, but was extremely frustrated with the way I had played and our team losing because of it. I was playing with a broken hand, but that is no excuse for my actions, and I am deeply regretful.</p>

      <p>“I want to personally apologize to anyone who I offended, especially those who I was responsive to on Twitter. My choice of words did not reflect who I am, but only what I was feeling. Also, my sincerest apologies to my teammates, coaches, the Browns organization and most of all, the fans and kids that motivate me to even pursue this dream.”</p>
      <p>He wished the Browns luck at the end of his message.</p>

      <p>Whitehead drew the fury of fans and was criticized by journalists after he missed a tackle on a Noah Fant 75-yard touchdown catch and another big play. He responded by lashing out at his fans on Twitter. According to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28003188/browns-say-safety-jermaine-whitehead-threatening-social-posts-unacceptable">ESPN</a>, Whitehead’s Twitter account was suspended before he left the locker room. He did not take questions from the media.</p>
