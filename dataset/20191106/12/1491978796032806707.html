      <p>My friend Nigel Cross, who has died aged 66, coolly straddled the worlds of literature and international development.</p>
      <p>Born in Cambridge to Barry Cross, a university academic who became president of Corpus Christi College, and his wife, Audrey (nee Crow), Nigel was educated at Clifton college, Bristol, and Sussex University, where he studied English.</p>
      <p>In 1974, following graduation, he was working in a bar on Exmoor when he met <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1546039/Victor-Bonham-Carter.html">Victor Bonham-Carter</a>, the president of <a href="https://www.exmoorsociety.com/">the Exmoor Society</a> and secretary of the <a href="https://www.rlf.org.uk/">Royal Literary Fund</a> (RLF). Victor recognised Nigel’s bookish aspirations and found him a job as the fund’s archivist, a post he held until 1984. With access to its papers of struggling authors, he wrote The Common Writer: Life in Nineteenth-Century Grub Street, published in 1985. He also produced combative book reviews for publications including the Spectator and the New Statesman.</p>
      <p>In 1975, he began a PhD in literary history at University College London, where he met his first wife, Caroline Dakers, now a professor of cultural history at Central Saint Martins in London. The couple married in 1980 and had two daughters, Harriet and Madeline.</p>
      <p>Restless in the literary world, Nigel began travelling abroad in the late 1970s. I met him during this time, and – hoping to get involved in international development – he and I set up the short-lived Arid Lands Research Agency in response to the Sahelian drought of the 70s.</p>
      <p>In 1983 Nigel became director of <a href="https://sahel.org.uk/about/">SOS Sahel</a> in London, which runs development programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Witty, self-effacing and assured, he used his skills as a communicator to coax money from donors and form a successful alliance of similar organisations in other countries, which now operates as <a href="http://sossahel.ngo/">SOS Sahel International</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1994 he moved to the Panos Institute (now the <a href="https://panosnetwork.org/">Panos Network)</a>, which promotes media and communication in the developing world. His achievements there led to him being hired in 1999 to head the<a href="https://www.iied.org/"> International Institute for Environment and Development</a>.</p>
      <p>However he had bouts of depression for which, in his own words, he “sought no treatment, preferring to drink and read poetry”. His health and relationships suffered as a result of his alcoholism, which contributed to his divorce in 2010 and later to his death.</p>
      <p>Professionally, he yearned for a return to the field. After a short interlude as a professorial fellow at Soas University of London he joined the Dutch development agency <a href="https://snv.org/">SNV</a> in 2008 as its director in South Sudan – a challenging period for that country <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/10/south-sudan-celebrates-independence">as it neared independence</a>.</p>
      <p>There he met a Ugandan colleague, Josephine Namusisi, whom he married in 2014. Latterly he lived between his book-strewn house in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and hers in Kampala.</p>
      <p>He is survived by Josephine, Harriet and Madeline.</p>
