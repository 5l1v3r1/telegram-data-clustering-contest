      <p>Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483926/doctor-sleeps-mike-flanagan-is-actively-talking-with-stephen-king-about-another-adaptation">CinemaBlend</a>, Flanagan says he’s talking to Shining and Doctor Sleep author Stephen King about where to go with a potential follow-up.</p>
      <p>“[We’re] talking actively about what’s next, and we have a great idea for that I’m not allowed to talk about yet, but it’s really cool, and yeah, I expect there will be another chance to play in that sandbox very soon,” he says.</p>

      <p>Talking of his excitement to work on <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, Flanagan said: “It’s been my dream since I was a kid to be able to adapt Stephen King, and he’s let me play in that sandbox two times; I would be thrilled to do it again.</p>
      <p>“He’s been happy both times, which is still like [mind-blown gesture], as long as that keeps up, if he’ll have me back, I’m there for the long haul. I’ll do as many as he’ll let me.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/stephen-king-doctor-sleep-redeemed-stanley-kubricks-shining-2564948">Stephen King has also been praising Flanagan’s work on <i>Doctor Sleep</i></a>, saying that he felt it “redeemed” Kubrick’s direction on <i>The Shining</i>, which he was somewhat unhappy with.</p>
      <p>“I read the script to this one very, very carefully,” the author said. “Because obviously I wanted to do a good job with the sequel, because people knew the book <i>The Shining</i>, and I thought, I don’t want to screw this up.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve enjoyed all his movies,” King said of Flanagan. “I read the [<i>Doctor Sleep</i>] script very, very carefully and I said to myself, ‘Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version of <i>The Shining</i> is redeemed for me here.’”</p>
