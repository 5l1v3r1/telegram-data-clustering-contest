      <p>A Wishaw library worker is stepping away from a life at the bookshelves after four decades of serving the public.</p>
      <p>May Young finished up at the library at the Houldsworth Centre last week after 44 years of service.</p>
      <p>And May’s colleagues were not letting her head off into the sunset without a farewell bash.</p>
      <p>She said: “I began working at Motherwell Library and then when my son Graeme was born I went back to work at Wishaw and have been here ever since.</p>
      <p>“I love working here and I’ve worked with some great people over the years.</p>
      <p>“I like a blether as well and enjoy speaking to many of the regulars who use the library nearly every day.</p>
      <p>“My husband Robert I like to travel so we will be going to Madrid in a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>“I also like walking and swimming so I will keep myself busy.</p>
      <p>“Obviously I love to read as well so I’ll be sure to come back to the library regularly though.”</p>
      <p>To thank May for all her hard work down the years, the Wishaw Library team nominated her for our Say it with Flowers competition.</p>
      <p>And we were on hand to mark 61-year-old May’s final shift last Wednesday with the presentation of a beautiful bouquet thanks to our friends at Pixie’s Petals in Newmains.</p>
      <p>One of May’s co-workers at Wishaw Library, Annette Munro, said: “May will be sorely missed by everyone who works here and everyone who uses the library.</p>
      <p>“All of our regular customers know her very well.</p>
      <p>“She started off at Motherwell Library before joining Wishaw.</p>
      <p>“Her husband retired last year so it’s a good time for her to be going although we are very sad to see her leaving.</p>
      <p>“We have a small staff at the library but we all get on well and it’s a great place to work.</p>
      <p>“We are all sorry to be losing May from our team.”</p>
