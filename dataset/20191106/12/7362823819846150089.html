      <h1>Erdogan: Turkey arrested slain ISIS leader Baghdadi’s wife, other relatives</h1>

      <p>Turkey's president on Wednesday announced the country's forces had captured multiple relatives of slain <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis">ISIS</a> leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, including one of the terrorist's wives -- but he also used the occasion to needle the United States for making "a fuss" about the mission that resulted in the most-wanted militant's death.</p>
      <p>During a <a href="https://twitter.com/ragipsoylu/status/1192050475794862080">speech</a> in Ankara, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/turkey">Turkish</a> President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the arrest of one of Baghdadi's wives and confirmed previous reports that the terrorist's sister and brother-in-law had also been taken into custody by Turkey.</p>
      <p>Turkish officials said they detained Baghdadi’s older sister, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/sister-of-isis-leader-al-baghdadi-arrested-in-intelligence-gold-mine-turkey-says">Rasmiya Awad</a>, on Monday. She was with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children when she was taken into custody.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Baghdadi, the Associated Press says, was known to have four wives.</p>
      <p>Erdogan in his speech Tuesday didn't provide any other details about the detainees, but he did appear to take a shot at U.S. leaders, noting Turkey "didn't make a fuss" after capturing the trio.</p>
      <p>"The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel. They started a communication campaign about this," Erdogan said Wednesday. "But, I am announcing it here for the first time: We captured his wife and didn't make a fuss like them. Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother-in-law in Syria."</p>

      <p>Baghdadi was killed in Syria in late October in a raid carried out by U.S. troops.</p>
      <p>Islamic State spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, considered a potential successor to Baghdadi, was himself killed in northwestern Syria in a separate attack by U.S. forces, a senior State Department official confirmed to Fox News last week.</p>
