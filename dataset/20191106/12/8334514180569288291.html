      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish prosecutors will appeal a court ruling which found five men who assaulted a 14-year-old girl guilty of sexual abuse rather than the graver crime of rape, a source at the prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The ruling, which has sparked days of protests by women activists, has revived memories of the so-called Wolfpack case which led to mass rallies across Spain last year over chauvinism and sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>Last Thursday, Barcelona’s High Court sentenced the five men to 10-12 years in prison. It ruled that their 2016 assault was not rape because the victim, who was drunk and unconscious, could neither “agree to (nor) oppose the sexual relations”.</p>
      <p>In its appeal, the Barcelona prosecutor’s office said it wanted the men instead to be charged with rape, which carries prison sentences of 15 to 20 years.</p>
      <p>Women activists have branded last week's verdict a "disgrace" and have demanded that the government reform the penal code to allow for a broader definition of rape and tougher sentences.

      <p>Spanish law currently does not legally recognize rape unless physical violence or intimidation is employed. The Socialist government, which is facing a national election on Sunday, has appointed a panel to review relevant parts of the penal code.</p>
      <p>Many European countries have revised sexual violence laws to recognize the importance of explicit consent and take non-physical forms of coercion and abuse of power into account.</p>
      <p>In the Wolfpack case a lower court ruled in 2016 that five men who gang-raped a teenager at a bull-running festival were guilty of sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>Following the mass protests and an appeal, Spain’s Supreme Court ruled in June this year that they were guilty of rape and increased their sentences to 15 years from nine.</p>
