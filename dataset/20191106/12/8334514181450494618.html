      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - New outfits designed for Britain’s Queen Elizabeth will no longer be made with real fur, Buckingham Palace said, in a move welcomed by animal rights activists.</p>
      <p>However, while the 93-year-old monarch’s future garments will be made with fake fur, she will not dispose of old outfits adorned in real fur.</p>
      <p>“As new outfits are designed for The Queen, any fur used will be fake,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>“We are not suggesting that all fur on existing outfits will be replaced, or that The Queen will never wear fur again. The Queen will continue to re-wear existing outfits in her wardrobe.”</p>
      <p>Over the years, the queen has been photographed in an array of fully fur or fur-trimmed outfits including evening stoles, ceremonial robes, winter hats and coats.</p>
      <p>Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed the move.</p>
      <p>“We’re raising a glass of gin and Dubonnet to the Queen’s compassionate decision to go fur-free,” PETA UK wrote on its Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>The news follows steps by several fashion houses to go fur-free and improve their green and ethical credentials as consumers became more environmentally aware.</p>
      <p>Last year, London Fashion Week, a trade event where designers present their latest creations on the catwalk, declared itself fur-free for the first time.</p>
