        <b>Joe Schmidt will release his autobiography ‘Ordinary Joe’ on November 21, his publisher Penguin Ireland confirmed today.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I was hesitant about putting my memories and thoughts into words but was encouraged to do so by a number of people close to me,” Schmidt said.</p>
      <p>“I’m an accidental coach and feel incredibly lucky to have worked alongside great people and to have had the opportunities that I’ve had. Coaching in New Zealand, France and Ireland has been both challenging and rewarding, but the support from everyone and particularly the fans has been phenomenal. It is something I really appreciate.”</p>

      <p>Although Ireland suffered a disappointing 2019 Rugby World Cup campaign, Schmidt’s time in Ireland with both Leinster and the national team has had a transformative impact on the sport in this country.</p>
      <p>Two European Cups with Leinster, three Six Nations titles including a Grand Slam and historic wins over the All Blacks were just some of the highlights during his time in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Schmidt will speak about his new book at three events in Dublin, Belfast and Limerick.</p>
