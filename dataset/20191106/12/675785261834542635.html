      <h1>Second man pleads guilty over Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac attempted robbery</h1>
      <h2>Ashley Smith and Jordan Northover were charged over the incident back in July</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:06:08+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>A second man has pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> stars Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac.</p>
      <p>Jordan Northover, 26, of West Yorkshire, appeared at Harrow Crown Court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Ashley Smith, 30, of Cardinals Way, north London, had already entered a guilty plea after the pair were charged with attempted robbery and threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a public place, following the incident in Platt's Lane, Hampstead, in July.</p>
      <p>Video footage emerged at the time of the attempted robbery, where two assailants approached Ozil's £100,000 Mercedes G Jeep wielding knives.</p>
      <p>They tried to steal Kolasinac's watch, who chased them away, while Ozil and his wife, Amine - who was also in the car - later sought refuge in a local restaurant where they were well known.</p>

      <p>Both players missed the start of the season for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> due to the incident.</p>
      <p>Kolasinac's wife, Bella, reportedly left England and fled back to Germany due to safety fears following the attack.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Athletic about the incident, Ozil said: "Sead’s reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers. The second one was in front of my car on his moped so I couldn’t drive.</p>
      <p>“We were newly wed and I was scared about my wife. I was scared about Sead. I wasn’t thinking about myself. I was worried they were going to open my wife’s door and they tried, so I reached across her to keep it closed.</p>
      <p>“I started driving but they followed. I was driving very fast but they kept coming close on the moped. I tried to move the car, block them, escape, but each time they would be there. My wife was extremely scared."</p>
