      <p>Talking about the collaboration, Akshay had told ETimes, “Having experienced the magic of B Praak’s voice firsthand with Teri Mitti from my film Kesari, there was not much needed to convince me to come onboard for ‘Fillhal.’ And to top it off the lyrics are so beautiful, it’s impossible to not feel anything. When I met with the lyricist, Jaani he told me it’s his best written song till date and I couldn’t agree more. This brilliant combination of a soulful voice and lyrics to match got me to make my music video debut.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the professional front, Akshay has his kitty full with interesting projects like 'Good Newwz', 'Sooryavanshi', 'Laxmmi Bomb' and 'Bachchan Pandey'.</p>
