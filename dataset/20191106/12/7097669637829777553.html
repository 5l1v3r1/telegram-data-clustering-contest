      <h1>Kentucky election: Republican appears to suffer stunning defeat one day after Trump visited and begged supporters ‘you can’t let that happen to me!’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:16:57+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zamira Rahim</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/republicans">Republicans</a> appear to have lost the race for governor in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, as voters in the state delivered a stunning upset a day after <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> urged them to back the GOP.</p>
      <p>Andy Beshear, a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democratic">Democratic</a> candidate, has a narrow lead with all votes counted and has declared victory over incumbent governor Matt Bevin.</p>
      <p>“Tonight, voters in Kentucky sent a message, loud and clear, for everyone to hear,” Mr Beshear, the current Kentucky Attorney General, said in his victory speech.</p>
      <p>“It’s a message that says our elections don’t have to be about right versus left, they are still about right versus wrong.”</p>
      <p>Matt Bevin, one of the most unpopular governors in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/us">US</a>, has refused to concede.</p>
      <p>The governor has repeatedly clashed with teachers in Kentucky. He said he was not conceding by “any stretch” and hinted that he would request a recount.</p>
      <p>“We want the process to be followed and there is a process,” he said.</p>
      <p>His apparent loss in the deeply conservative state came a day after Mr Trump appeared at a rally in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lexington">Lexington</a> and pleaded with residents to vote for Mr Bevin.</p>
      <p>“If you lose, it sends a really bad message!” Mr Trump said during the event on Monday night.</p>
      <p>He said if the Matt Bevin lost, the media would say “Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.”</p>
      <p>“This would be the greatest [loss],” the president said. “You can’t let that happen to me!”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democrats">Democrats</a> also won control of both houses in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/virginia">Virginia’s</a> state legislature on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The party is now in charge of the state’s government, for the first time since 1993.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/virginia">Virginia</a> contests were closely watched for hints as to how the 2020 presidential race could unfold.</p>
      <p>Pollsters warned against reading too much into individual races but the Democrats’ rising popularity among suburban voters in conservative states is likely to worry the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gop">GOP</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has attempted to backtrack and frame the Kentucky governor’s race in a positive tone, despite the loss.</p>
      <p>“Our big Kentucky Rally on Monday night had a massive impact on all of the races,” the president claimed on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> as the poor result emerged.</p>
      <p>“The president just about dragged Matt Bevin across the finish line, helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end,” Brad Parscale, the president’s 2020 campaign manager, added.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/us-justice-department">US Justice Department</a> said Tuesday’s state and local elections showed no evidence of successful tampering by any foreign government.</p>
