      <p>A woman who attracted fame for her middle-finger gesture to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> has continued her opposition to the president and his party by flipping a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/republican">Republican</a> seat in a local government race – and will now legislate for an area including some of the president's property empire.</p>
      <p>An image of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/juli-briskman">Juli Briskman</a> raising her middle finger at the presidential motorcade in October 2017 became a symbol of American anger at the White House as voters raged at Mr Trump’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-immigration-daca-latest-repeal-court-9th-circuit-immigration-a8625186.html">plans to introduce harsh policies restricting the residency rights</a> of child migrants as well as his response to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-puerto-rico-aid-food-stamps-hurricane-maria-a8840796.html">disaster in Puerto Rico caused by Hurricane Maria</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time of the photo, Mr Trump had been heading to the Trump National Golf Club, some 20 miles north of the White House.</p>
      <p>Now Ms Briskman, a lifelong resident of Loudon County in Washington DC’s neighbouring state of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/virginia">Virginia</a>, has won a seat on the region's board of supervisors  – and will legislate for an area that includes the Trump golf resort he had been visiting that day.</p>
      <p>"Looking forward to representing my friends and neighbours in Algonkian". she tweeted shortly after her victory.</p>
      <p>While the 52-year-old's local campaign focussed on government accountability and school funding, her willingness to fight against the presidency proved to be a driving force behind her decision to stand.</p>
      <p>“It’s not like I can run against him,” she previously told the Washington Post, “but I can run.”</p>
      <p>Ms Briskman’s 2017 protest against the president proved to be a double-edged sword for the mother of two – affording her international headlines while also resulting in her being fired from her job at government contractor Akima LCC – a firm she later filed a lawsuit against.</p>
      <p> “They walked me to my desk and then out the building. I was even told I could not get photos of my children from my computer before they bleached it,” she told <i>the Independent</i> at the time.</p>
      <p>“It was like I had embezzled a couple of million company dollars.”</p>
      <p>With 52% of the vote, she was one of four Democrats to win seats from Republican and independent officials in the county.</p>
      <p>The local poll, which also saw the state government fall into <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democrat">Democrat</a> control for the first time in 26 years, is one of a number of state and municipal elections being watched for insight into the mood of the nation in the run up to the 2020 presidential race.</p>
