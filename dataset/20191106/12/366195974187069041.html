      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics</b></u>:</p>
      <p>First time I saw you, I wasn't thinking of you and I<br/>I was just thinking of I<br/>First time we fucked was at my place, it was a couple years late<br/>But it was fate and I think you feel good about it<br/>So now we end up in this place we both hate<br/>And I think it takes a sacrifice<br/>Now face, it's not right, it's impractical<br/>For you to leave that man and come and just be mine</p>
