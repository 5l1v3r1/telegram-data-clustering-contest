      <h1>Saudi Aramco approaches Malaysian energy giant Petronas with IPO offer</h1>
      <h2>Abu Dhabi's state investor Mubadala Investment Co has also been approached by Aramco's advisers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:11:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/saudi-aramco">Saudi Aramco </a>has approached Malaysian state energy company <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/petronas">Petronas </a>to participate in Aramco's initial public offering (IPO), <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/petronas">Petronas </a>said on Wednesday, as the Middle Eastern oil giant seeks cornerstone investors for the listing.</p>
      <p>The Saudi government plans to sell 2 per cent of state-run Aramco, the world's most profitable company, in a domestic listing on Dec. 11, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The approach comes as Petronas, officially known as Petroliam Nasional Bhd, nears the start of commercial operations at a $27 billion refinery and petrochemical project built jointly with Aramco in southern Malaysia.</p>
      <p>"We have been recently approached by representatives of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/saudi-aramco">Saudi Aramco </a>to consider Petronas' participation in its initial public offering exercise," Petronas, the Malaysian government's cash cow, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>"However, we will not be providing any further comments on this matter at this time."</p>
      <p>Aramco's much-vaunted IPO was delayed as deal advisers said they needed more time to lock in cornerstone, or anchor, investors such as sovereign wealth funds. In 2016, state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China sold 77 per cent of its $7.4 billion (5.74 billion pounds) IPO to such backers.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in September that Aramco had approached Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore's GIC and other sovereign wealth funds to invest in the domestic leg of its listing.</p>
      <p>Abu Dhabi's state investor Mubadala Investment Co has also been approached by Aramco's advisers.</p>
      <p>Asked about its interest in the Aramco IPO, Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd told Reuters it "does not have any investments in the oil and gas sector".</p>
