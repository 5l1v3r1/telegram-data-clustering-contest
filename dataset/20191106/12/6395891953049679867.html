      <p><b>ROMEÂ (AP)</b> - Worried about big job losses, Italy's government is trying to convince steelmaker ArcelorMittal not to pull out of a deal to acquire a plant in southern Italy.</p>
      <p>Premier Giuseppe Conte was meeting Wednesday in Rome with Indian tycoon Lakshmi Mittal and other company executives.</p>
      <p>Officially, the world's largest steelmaker is nixing the Taranto factory deal because Italy reneged on an arrangement to give the company immunity from prosecution for any environmental damage.</p>
      <p>Taranto citizens blame the plant for local health problems.</p>
      <p>Some 10,700 steelworkers could lose their jobs, most of those in Taranto, a serious blow for Conte's struggling center-left coalition.</p>
      <p>Union leaders have called a strike at the Taranto plant.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal announced production cuts at several European plants due to weak demand and high imports.</p>
