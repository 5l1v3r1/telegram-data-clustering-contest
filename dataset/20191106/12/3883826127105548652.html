        <b>Schools should not be used as polling stations in the general election, to avoid disrupting nativity plays and Christmas concerts, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He has written to returning officers, saying there is funding available for councils to find alternative venues for places to vote on 12 December.</p>
      <p>Mr Williamson says he wants to keep disruption "to an absolute minimum".</p>
      <p>Head teachers have backed the calls to avoid using schools for voting.</p>
      <p>The timing of a general election means it risks clashing with long-arranged plans for Christmas events in schools, such as carol concerts and nativity plays.</p>
      <h3>Find a more stable alternative</h3>
      <p>Mr Williamson has written to returning officers, who are responsible for overseeing elections, urging them to avoid using schools.</p>
      <p>"In every community there will be alternatives and I would ask that, wherever possible, these are used instead," he told them.</p>

      <p>Local authorities, which are responsible for finding venues, have been told that central government will reimburse the costs of using other places as polling stations.</p>
      <p>The education secretary says he wants to make sure that "long-planned and important events" are not disrupted.</p>
      <p>Christmas events are "important highlights in the school calendar and the result of a huge amount of hard work," he says.</p>
      <p>Head teachers have welcomed the intervention.</p>
      <p>"Schools will already have in place a schedule of events for the term, including Christmas activities," said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union.</p>
      <p>"It would clearly be much better for children, parents and staff if they were able to go ahead with these events without the disruption of the school being used as a polling station."</p>
      <p>Mr Barton said there needed to be a longer-term consideration about whether schools were really "suitable venues" for polling stations.</p>
      <p>"This is the third election this year, following on from local and European elections, and it is the third general election in four years," he said.</p>
