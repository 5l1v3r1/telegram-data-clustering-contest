      <p>LONDON, Nov 6 — The dollar drifted lower against other major currencies today as investors awaited fresh developments in the US-China trade talks.</p>
      <p>As the United States and China work to narrow their differences enough to sign a “phase one” trade deal as early as this month, hopes of a breakthrough have boosted sentiment across world markets.</p>
      <p>But after sizeable moves yesterday, which included a strengthening in China’s offshore yuan to three-month highs against the dollar, currency markets moved into wait-and-see mode.</p>
      <p>That sentiment was echoed in global stock markets, which steadied after a three-day rally.</p>
      <p>“The market now wants confirmation that there is a venue, that this (phase one deal) will be signed,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.</p>
      <p>“A lot of good news was built into the price and unless we get something more, a little bit of disappointment will come through.”</p>
      <p>At 1130 GMT the dollar index, which measures the dollar’s value against other major currencies, was a fifth of a per cent lower at 97.798 after rising 0.4 per cent the previous day.</p>
      <p>The dollar was 0.2 per cent softer at 109.01 yen, although still within sight of a three-months high hit last week at 109.285.</p>
      <p>Europe’s common currency, meanwhile, was a touch firmer at US$1.1089 (RM4.59), having dropped 0.5 per cent against a broadly-robust greenback yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Swiss franc changed hands at 0.9929 to the dollar, little changed on the day, following its 0.5 per cent fall the previous day.</p>
      <p>Analysts said better-than-expected US economic data in the past week had eased expectations for further easing from the US Federal Reserve and that this boded well for the dollar outlook.</p>
      <p>A survey of the vast US service sector published yesterday showed that business sentiment had improved in October from a three-year low in September.</p>
      <p>The rebound is a welcome sign for dollar bulls as a fall in the service sector index would have suggested that the malaise among manufacturers hit by the trade war was also infecting the service sector. That followed a strong US employment report on Friday.</p>
      <p>“Latest data has helped eased concern about a sharp slowdown in growth,” said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFG.</p>
      <p>“We have now had the US ISM and jobs report and they were both stronger than expected and that provides a firm foundation for the dollar this month.”</p>
      <p>Data released today showed German industrial orders rose more than expected in September, offering a glimmer of hope for an export-powered economy hit hard by global trade tensions.</p>
      <p>The generally positive mood supported the risk-sensitive Australian dollar, which changed hands at US$0.6899. It was little changed on the day but has maintained gains of 3.4 per cent since hitting a 10-1/2-year low on October 2.</p>
      <p>China’s offshore yuan steadied around 7.00 per dollar in Europe after having risen to a three-month high of 6.9867 to the dollar yesterday on hopes for a trade truce.</p>
      <p>The currency has gained almost three per cent from its record low in the offshore trade marked in early September. — Reuters</p>
