      <h1>For under $30, HelloTalk delivers a smart, fun way for language learning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/tnwdeals/" target="_blank">TNW Deals</a></address>
      <p><b>TLDR:</b> HelloTalk is immersive language learning with native speakers and exercises to help you grasp your new tongue. And right now, it’s 87% off.</p>
      <p>Immersive learning works. It makes sense if you think about it. Plunge a student headlong into a new area of study and the sheer volume, extra practice opportunities and increased contextual learning will help make that student proficient in their new skill faster.</p>
      <p>Anyone who’s used immersion techniques in learning a new language can speak to its benefits. One study found Portland fifth-graders assigned to immersion programs did <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9903.html">13 percent better than their peers on state reading tests</a>. And that number rose to 22 percent better among eighth graders.</p>
      <p>We’re gonna assume you aren’t willing to return to middle school to learn a new language, so technology is here to help with the innovative approach offered by the folks at HelloTalk. You can get in on a <a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/hellotalk-vip-lifetime?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hellotalk-vip-lifetime&amp;utm_term=scsf-345257&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpRC&amp;scsonar=1">lifetime of their VIP language training services</a> now at <a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/hellotalk-vip-lifetime?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hellotalk-vip-lifetime&amp;utm_term=scsf-345257&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpRC&amp;scsonar=1">more than $200 off, just $29</a> from TNW Deals.</p>
      <p>At its heart, HelloTalk is language training handled primarily via cultural exchange. Once you’re a member, HelloTalk connects you with another of their 15 million members, someone who happens to be a native speaker in the language of your choice. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, that person wants to learn your language, and through a variety of exercises using texting, voice recordings, video calls and even doodles, you and your language partner are each guided to proficiency in your new language.</p>
      <p>Even if you run into trouble, HelloTalk’s intuitive language tools like a built-in translator, pronunciation aids and on-the-fly corrections will keep your conversations running smoothly. And over 115,000 reviews on the App Store and Google Play combined can attest to HelloTalk’s power, with the app receiving 4/5 stars on Google Play and 4.7/5 on the App Store.</p>
      <p>You can attack a whole new inspired approach to language acquisition with Hello Talk, especially now that their lifetime VIP services are <a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/hellotalk-vip-lifetime?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hellotalk-vip-lifetime&amp;utm_term=scsf-345257&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpRC&amp;scsonar=1">slashed by nearly 90 percent</a> with this limited-time deal.</p>
