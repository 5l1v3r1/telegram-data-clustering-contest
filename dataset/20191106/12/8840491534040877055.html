      <p>THE Mayo GAA County Board has called an emergency meeting for tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>It follows statements issued by seven clubs yesterday which challenged the reported vote of confidence taken in the officers of the board at last Monday's behind-clased-doors meeting of the organisation.</p>
      <p>Charlestown Sarsfields, Castlebar Mitchels, Larardane MacHales, Burrishoole, Ardnaree, Ballycastle and Louisburgh questioned the press release by the board which highlighted the 'resounding vote of confidence'.</p>
      <p>In a communication to clubs last night, Mayo secretary Dermot Butler appealed to clubs to desist from using social media to express their views.</p>
      <p>He said the proper forum is to go through their respective club secretaries.</p>
      <p><i>The Connaught Telegraph</i> has learned the board is investigating reports that last Monday's meeting was allegedly recorded by a person in attendance and is being circulated. </p>
