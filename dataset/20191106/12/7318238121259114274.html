      <h1>Pro-China lawmaker stabbed in Hong Kong amid anti-government tensions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:57:38+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">Linda Givetash and Caroline Radnofsky and Ed Flanagan and Associated Press </a></address>
      <p>A pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong was stabbed on Wednesday amid rising <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-police-fire-tear-gas-pro-democracy-protest-n1075606">opposition to China's control</a>over the territory.</p>
      <p>Video widely shared on social media shows a man stab Junius Ho as he was campaigning near a train station. The video shows a man appear hand Ho a bouquet of yellow flowers before taking a weapon out of his bag and stabbing him.</p>
      <p>After receiving medical treatment Wednesday, Ho told local reporters that he was left with a chest wound just under an inch deep and that his ribs blocked the blade from doing greater damage.</p>
      <p>One suspect is in police custody, according to the Hong Kong government who condemned the attack and said it "will not tolerate any act of violence."</p>
      <p>"The citizens of Hong Kong need to be peaceful, sensible and respectful to one another when expressing their views," a government statement said.</p>
      <p>The territory has been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-protests-threaten-embarrass-china-s-communist-party-anniversary-n1060281">gripped by increasingly violent protests for months</a>as anti-government activists demand political reform and the protection of historic democratic rights.</p>
      <p>The protests were initially sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill in June, but have since morphed to include demands for Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam to step down and greater democratic freedoms.</p>
      <p>Ho has become a hated figure among protesters after a demonstration in his constituency turned violent <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/police-launch-tear-gas-masked-assailants-attack-protesters-hong-kong-n1032131#">in July, leaving 45 people injured</a>. Ho was seen shaking hands with some of the attackers involved in the incident, although he has denied any collusion claiming he hadn't been aware of the violence at the time.</p>

      <p>Wednesday's attack occurred a day after Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a trade event.</p>
      <p>Xi offered his support and trust in Lam and her team, according to a report from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, while calling for unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in order to return Hong Kong to peaceful order.</p>
      <p>Lam said she would continue efforts to control the demonstrations — which includes bans on protests and the use of face coverings — in order to uphold the "principle of 'one country, two systems'" and "put an end to the violence."</p>
      <p>Ho has not been the only lawmaker to face attacks. On Sunday, district councilor <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-lawmaker-s-ear-partially-bitten-during-anti-government-n1075891">Andrew Chiu had part of his ear bitten off</a>during a demonstration at a shopping mall.</p>
      <p>Police have fired back at demonstrations with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets — measures that have protesters and other international groups raise questions over<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-police-defend-shooting-protester-lawful-reasonable-n1061086">the excessive</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-police-defend-shooting-protester-lawful-reasonable-n1061086">use of force</a>.</p>
