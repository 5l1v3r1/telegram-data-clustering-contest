      <h2>Rescuers beat the clock to reach stranded teenager as tide threatened to snatch him from rocks and sweep him out to sea on stormy night</h2>

      <p>Heroic islanders have received HM Coastguard’s highest national accolade for a cliffhanger race-against-time rescue.</p>
      <p>Rescue services, including many volunteers, saved a teenager trapped at the bottom of a 130ft cliff as the tide came in.</p>
      <p>The after-dark drama unfolded on May 9 last year (2018) at the dangerous Fethaland on the north tip of mainland Shetland.</p>
      <p>A young man was cragfast for four hours. His friend had managed to scramble back up to raise the alarm and trigger a land,sea and air operation.</p>

      <p>Coastguard teams from Lerwick, Hillswick and Sumburgh, coastguard search and rescue helicopter and RNLI volunteers were scrambled.</p>
      <p>The coastguard operations centre in Shetland coordinated the successful emergency response.</p>
      <p>Now Shetland has been awarded the prestigious Department for Transport Rescue Shield given to coastguards performing the year’s most outstanding rescue.</p>
      <p>It’s the sixth time that Shetland-based teams have been presented with the shield.</p>
      <p>It was handed over by Brian Johnson, chief executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

      <p>The rescuers worked in darkness battling gales, rough seas and a rising tide to reach the stranded climber.</p>
      <p>Johnson said yesterday (Wed): “This was the most difficult rescue in the year in the whole of the coastguard services.</p>
      <p>“It’s a really big deal. The circumstances included coordination of volunteers, scaling cliffs, and helicopter and a lifeboat.</p>
      <p>“This was real coordination from the community from a number of emergency services in a quite extraordinary rescue.”</p>
      <p>Dave Sweeney, Shetland’s senior coastal operations officer, said rescue teams navigated difficult terrain in appalling conditions on the narrow headland.</p>
      <p>The helicopter and Aith lifeboat used their night lights to illuminate the cliff-face for brave rescuer Jamie Newlands.</p>
      <p>He descended the cliff in storm force winds, rain and heavy squalls from the incoming tide to recover the casualty to the top.</p>

      <p>He was winched aboard the helicopter winched and taken to a waiting ambulance at Tingwall Airport.</p>
      <p>Despite being mildly hypothermic due to exposure the teenager was otherwise uninjured.</p>
      <p>Sweeney said: “As emergency response teams we rely heavily on each other to achieve success and this case was a prime example of that.</p>
      <p>“It was a challenging rescue and we needed all our teams’ shared expertise and resources to safely rescue the teenager.</p>
      <p>“It was teamwork at its best. We’re honoured to be awarded for our efforts on this particular rescue.</p>
      <p>“It’s a mark of recognition for all the work and dedication of the front line volunteers, paid crew members and behind-the-scenes teams that help us all save lives together.”</p>
