      <p>BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A subsidiary of China’s Huobi Group, one of the largest cryptocurrency trading platforms in the world, announced on Wednesday a $100 million investment for the creation of a data center in Argentina.</p>
      <p>Huobi Argentina’s facility, dedicated to blockchain, would be the largest of its kind in the region, the company said.</p>
      <p>Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the digital currency bitcoin, is a shared database maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.</p>
      <p>Huobi Argentina said in September it planned to establish a local team and a fiat gateway to trade or convert the Argentine peso to cryptocurrency. The company said on Wednesday that transactions with Argentine pesos would be possible by the end of November.  </p>
      <p>The investment comes as a pervasive economic crisis in Argentina prompted the government to impose stricter currency controls to prop up the rickety peso currency following President-elect Alberto Fernandez’s victory over incumbent Mauricio Macri in the October presidential elections.</p>
