      <p>Andre Gomes has thanked people who have sent him well wishes as he recovers at home following ankle surgery.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Everton midfielder suffered a fracture-dislocation to his right ankle during the club’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He had an operation on Monday, which was said to have gone “extremely well”, and on Wednesday the Portugal international provided his first public comments since the incident.</p>

      <p>In a video message on his Twitter account, he said: “Hi everyone. As you already know, everything went well.</p>
      <p>“I’m already at home with my family and I would like to thank you all for the support, the messages and the positive energy. Thank you.”</p>
      <p>Gomes is expected to be sidelined for anywhere between six months and a year given the seriousness of the injury, which left players from both sides visibly upset on the pitch at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Tottenham forward Son Heung-min, who has sent off for conceding the foul which led to Gomes’ injury, had his suspension overturned by the Football Association on Tuesday.</p>
