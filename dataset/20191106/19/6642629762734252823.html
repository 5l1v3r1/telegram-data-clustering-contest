      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a> captured a wife of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-isil-191028140353503.html">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, its president said on Wednesday, more than a week after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) leader killed himself during a raid by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">US</a> special forces.</p>
      <p>Al-Baghdadi was known to have four wives, the maximum number one can have under Islamic law at one time.</p>
      <p>"The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel. They started a communication campaign about this," said President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>.</p>
      <p>"But I am announcing it here for the first time: We captured his wife and didn't make a fuss like them. Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother-in-law in Syria," he said in a speech at Ankara University. He gave no other details.</p>
      <p>A senior Turkish official said earlier this week that Turkey had captured al-Baghdadi's sister, her husband and daughter-in-law, and hoped to gain intelligence from them about ISIL, although Ankara has not said what knowledge they may have had about the group's operations.</p>
      <p>A Turkish official said the 65-year-old sister is suspected of being affiliated with ISIL and called her capture an intelligence "gold mine".</p>
      <p>Fahrettin Altun, Turkey's communications director, said on Twitter. "The arrest of al-Baghdadi's sister is yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations."</p>
      <h3>Commando raid</h3>
      <p>Up and until his death, al-Baghdadi had moved from place to place in eastern Syria amid a tightening US-led campaign against his group. He ended up in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, an area controlled by a rival armed group.</p>
      <p>Last month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said two of al-Baghdadi's wives had also been killed at the site of the American raid.</p>
      <p>Al-Baghdadi rose from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself caliph of all Muslims, holding sway over huge areas of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html">Iraq</a> and Syria from 2014-2017 before ISIL's control was wrested away by a US-led coalition.</p>
      <p>World leaders have welcomed his death, but they and security experts warned the group, which carried out atrocities against religious minorities and horrified most Muslims, remained a security threat in Syria and beyond.</p>
      <p>ISIL said a successor to al-Baghdadi - identified as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi - had been appointed. A senior US official said last week that Washington was looking into the new leader to determine where he came from.</p>
