      <p>Cape Town – The <b>South African Football Association (SAFA)</b> president <b>Danny Jordaan</b> has surprisingly commented on <b>Benni McCarthy</b> being sacked as head coach of <b>Cape Town City</b>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/safa-eager-to-hear-benni-mccarthy-s-future-plans/666843?fbclid=IwAR3jl0sz9N6H617HOx7Y9eKlmugCOOyDGq2CXbkIUmvUIYzddhAAitUk40w">KickOff</a>, Jordaan was asked his thoughts on the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/cape-town-city-sack-benni-mccarthy-as-head-coach-20191104">Citizens ending their relationship with the former Bafana Bafana striker</a>.</p>
      <p>"Let me read first and understand what’s going on,” Jordaan said while attending an urgent SAFA press conference in Johannesburg following <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/BafanaBafana/russell-paul-resigns-as-acting-safa-ceo-20191105">Russell Paul's resignation as acting CEO of the association</a>.</p>
      <p>"As I say, I don't know what’s in his mind; I don’t know what happened (that led to his departure), so I cannot talk about it."</p>
      <p>Jordaan was then probed into answering whether McCarthy could fill a role within the association’s structures.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what his next steps or move is, we'll have to wait and see. He's a South African; he's a coach in this country and that’s why I say it's not the end of his career.</p>
      <p>"He's still in the beginning of his career but I don’t have the details, so let me not speak on something that I don’t have the facts around.</p>
      <p>"There are too many ifs. Let us sort out the ifs and then I can give you an answer. I can't go on the route to speculate - if it rains; if the sun shines."</p>
