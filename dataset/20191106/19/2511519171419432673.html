      <h1>Catholic Church investigating two nuns who returned pregnant from missionary trip to Africa</h1>
      <h2>One woman only discovered she was expecting after going to hospital with severe abdominal pains</h2>

      <p>Two <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/nuns">nuns</a> are being investigated by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/catholic-church">Catholic Church</a> after they became pregnant during missionary trips.</p>
      <p>The African women, who are from different orders in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Sicily">Sicily</a>, reportedly got pregnant while on separate missions to their home country.</p>
      <p>One of the nuns, a 34-year-old based at a convent in the northeastern town of Militello Rosmarino, in Messina, discovered she was pregnant after going to hospital with severe abdominal pains, the <a href="https://messina.gazzettadelsud.it/articoli/cronaca/2019/11/02/suora-incinta-a-militello-rosmarino-il-sindaco-una-religiosa-che-si-e-fatta-voler-bene-da-tutti-8e7a4d15-6d6f-4994-b4f4-96e0863bb738/"><i>Gazzetta del Sud</i></a> newspaper reports.</p>
      <p>The second nun, a mother superior caring for the elderly in the southeastern city of Ispica, in Ragusa, has also discovered she is pregnant.</p>
      <p>Salvatore Riotta, mayor of Militello Rosmarino, said he knew one of the nuns “well” and “regretted” the way the news had been leaked.</p>
      <p>He told reporters: "There is regret for what happened. Our community of 1,200 inhabitants is baffled by the way some have treated the news, not as secretly as it should have been.”</p>
      <p>The mayor added that the nun had taken her vows less than a year ago and was loved by everyone.</p>
      <p>Sicily’s health councillor, Ruggero Razza, said he would launch an internal investigation to find out how the pregnancies became public knowledge.</p>
      <p>He added in a Facebook post:  “I wish to express my solidarity first of all to them and to their respective orders.</p>
      <p>“I find it unfair that news that should have remained in the privacy of health facilities has become public knowledge.”</p>
      <p>The women will be able to choose whether to leave the Order and raise their children, according to the Gazzetta del Sud.</p>

      <p>The 34-year-old nun has been moved to a different order in Palermo, while the mother superior, thought to be about one month pregnant, returned home to Madagascar.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis earlier this year <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-nuns-sexual-abuse-catholic-church-priests-scandal-bishops-a8765031.html">admitted for the first time</a> that the Catholic Church has an ongoing issue with priests and even bishops sexually abusing nuns. There is no information around whether the nuns were abused in this case. </p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters aboard the papal plane in February as he returned to the Vatican from a visit to the United Arab Emirates, he said some of the nuns had been used as sex slaves and admitted more needed to be done to prevent it.</p>
      <p>“It is true ... there have been priests and even bishops who have done this. I think it is still going on because something does not stop just because you have become aware of it,” he said, according to the Associated Press. </p>
      <p>“We have been working on this for a long time. We have suspended some priests because of this.”</p>
