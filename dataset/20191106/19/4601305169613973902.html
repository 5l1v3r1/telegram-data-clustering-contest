      <p>Pantry moths are experts at finding their way into any open container of rice, flour, cereal, chips, nuts, etc. Then they breed in the boxes and bags. I hate it when I open a cabinet and a couple of moths fly out. It's even worse when I look at a bag of rice, and it is alive with motion.</p>
      <p>We've been putting our food into wide-mouth mason jars with these convenient <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SSN3L2/boingboing">one-piece plastic lids</a>. That has reduced the problem. We also started using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00ML8C7H8/boingboing">pantry moth traps</a>. These traps fold into little A-frame houses. The interior is coated with a sticky material that traps the flies. The traps also come with a postage stamp size pheromone lure to fool the pests into thinking a sexy moth is inside waiting for them. These things work well. After using them for a few weeks the only moths I see now are the dead ones stuck to the inside of the traps.</p>
