      <p>Water is a weapon of war that is deepening conflict in the Middle East, with women the worst hit, said British-Egyptian playwright Sabrina Mahfouz on the sidelines of her new show.<br/><br/>Raised in Cairo and London, Mahfouz wrote “A History of Water in the Middle East,” which retells the region’s colonial carve-up and subsequent water stresses, from Dubai to Baghdad.<br/><br/>“The weaponization of it (water) over so many centuries has obviously led to the situation now - where it just seems so much more extreme,” Mahfouz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.<br/><br/>“Access to water is just diminishing to the most non-existent levels,” she said after acting in her own show on Tuesday evening.<br/><br/>More than half the world’s population is likely to live in water-scarce areas by 2050, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.<br/><br/>Mahfouz depicts a series of women who triumph over such adversity by exploiting water shortages to their own advantage.<br/><br/>There is an Emirati who sets up a water-based dating app, helping couples conserve the world’s most precious resource, and a singing Jordanian plumber liberated by the shortages to take up a new profession fixing leaks.<br/><br/>“Women are always disproportionately affected (by war),” said Mahfouz at London’s prestigious Royal Court Theater.<br/><br/>They bear the brunt of family duties and fend off social pressures, too, she said.<br/><br/>Her stage characters discuss sexual violence against women in Yemen, who are unable even to wash, or who see their children die from water-borne diseases such as cholera.<br/><br/>But Mahfouz, elected as a fellow to Britain’s Royal Society of Literature last year, said her spirited characters were not to be pitied but lauded as women with an inner power.<br/><br/>“They’re showing a resilience and an inventiveness and an ability to adapt and succeed to try and find happiness - no matter what the external situations are,” she said.<br/><br/>The fast-paced play is a heavily condensed and edited race through history, said Mahfouz; choosing what to cover was hard.<br/><br/>“Almost every country has some sort of water-related argument with a neighboring country. ..I could only choose a few.”<br/><br/>A study in the journal Global Environmental Change found severe droughts had worsened conflicts in Arab Spring countries earlier this decade, forcing people to flee.<br/><br/>Water and climate experts point to a similar problem in Syria, where record droughts drove farming families into urban centers, exacerbating social and political tensions.<br/><br/>Egypt is at odds with its neighbors over access to the Nile and plans for a giant hydroelectric dam in Ethiopia have sparked regional tensions over restrictions to shared water supplies.<br/><br/>The most thirsty countries in the world are all in the Middle East and North Africa, with Qatar the most water-stressed country, followed by Israel and Lebanon, according to US think tank the World Resources Institute.</p>
