      <p>Last year, another iteration of the classic Hollywood story <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2458915/a-star-is-born-review"><i>A Star is Born</i></a> was brought to life by Bradley Cooper and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483681/lady-gaga-is-teaming-with-ridley-scott-for-her-first-movie-post-a-star-is-born">Lady Gaga</a>’s Jackson and Ally. The heartbreaking, music-filled epic found its most powerful element in the undeniable chemistry between the two actors. So much so, they amassed a following of fans rooting for a real love story for the pair. And then when Cooper and Gaga walked hand-in-hand to the Oscar stage and nuzzled cheeks during their <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467403/watch-lady-gaga-and-bradley-cooper-sing-shallow-at-the-oscars">passionate performance of “Shallow”</a>, thus <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/2467489/see-bradley-coopers-ex-wifes-cryptic-response-to-the-lady-gaga-rumors">the flames only fueled</a>.</p>
      <p>Not to mention how both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga dealt with breakups with their own significant others around the same time <i>A Star is Born</i> was trending. Gaga also split with her fiancé Christian Carino just before the Oscars. And Cooper and his longtime girlfriend Irina Shayk (and mother to their young daughter) <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474585/bradley-cooper-and-his-girlfriend-broke-up-so-bring-on-the-lady-gaga-rumors">called it quits earlier this year</a> as well. Were the stars were aligning just for the talented actors? Nope. Here’s what Lady Gaga says:</p>
      <blockquote>Quite frankly, I think the press is very silly. I mean, we made a love story. For me, as a performer and as an actress, of course we wanted people to believe that we were in love. And we wanted people to feel that love at the Oscars. We wanted it to go right through the lens of that camera and to every television that it was being watched on. And we worked hard on it, we worked for days. We mapped the whole thing out—it was orchestrated as a performance.</blockquote>
      <p>There you have it, the Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper rumors are only a result of acting at its finest. They really had the public fooled, though. If the Academy gave out a golden trophy for the most convincing on-screen couple, the <i>Star is Born</i> would have no doubt brought it home. As Lady Gaga tells it, the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467533/bradley-cooper-and-lady-gaga-meticulously-staged-their-steamy-oscars-performance">Oscars performance was carefully and purposefully orchestrated</a> in a way that would make viewers believe in what the song communicates. The beautiful love Jackson and Ally have in the movie. Relive it below:</p>

      <p>Lady Gaga discussed the rumors to Oprah Winfrey for <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29683686/lady-gaga-haus-laboratories-elle-interview/">Elle Magazine</a>, after the media mogul and television personality recalled the time Bradley Cooper told her if they were true, he wouldn’t be able to look Gaga in the eye at the piano. His Catholic guilt would have apparently taken over. How interesting – it sounds like it was easier for the two to play pretend then if they were thriving off actual romantic feelings for each other and conceal it from the audience.</p>
      <p>The rumors are a huge compliment to the pair’s performance as the <i>Star is Born</i> characters. Lady Gaga said they did talk about it and figured: “Well, I guess we did a good job!” The suspicions of fans seemed to only help bring authenticity to the Oscar-winning movie that recieved high acclaim and $434 million in box office earnings.</p>
      <p>Fans of the couple will certainly continue to dream and cry over the ending of <i>Star is Born</i> but hey, it’s a pretty amazing work of acting the two accomplished here!</p>
