      <h1>Ben Affleck to Juggle Heists, Kidnapping, Government Secrets in New Action Movie</h1>

      <p>The detective at the center of Robert Rodriguez’s new action thriller, <i>Hypnotic</i>, has enough to deal with considering there’s a string of high-end heists to solve, but now he’s got to find his missing daughter and untangle government secrets, too? That’s a lot to ask, but at least <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/ben-affleck-back-tattoo-ellen-video.html">Ben Affleck</a> has stepped up for the job. (Now that he’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/ben-affleck-will-no-longer-be-batman.html">no longer Batman</a>, he has to fulfill that desire to thwart extreme crimes somehow.) <i>Hypnotic </i>has the actor working again with Jeff Robinov, who produced two of his directorial efforts, <a href="http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/68101/"><i>The Town</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2012/10/movie-review-argo-ben-affleck.html"><i>Argo</i></a>, and Rodriguez is coming to this one fresh off <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/alita-battle-angel-review.html"><i>Alita: Battle Angel</i></a>. If that tenderhearted movie doesn’t get a sequel, maybe Rodriguez can find it in his vision to make this part of an <i>Alita</i> extended universe, and fold her <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/alita-battle-angels-cgi-eyes-behind-the-design.html">large-eyed</a> but larger-hearted murder bot into this movie as a super-heister, or maybe a super-partner for Affleck’s detective. It wouldn’t be <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2011/08/reviewing_the_smells_of_spy_ki.html">any crazier than <i>Spy Kids</i></a>, so why not?</p>
