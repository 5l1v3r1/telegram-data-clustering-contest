      <p>REUTERS: Saracens' representatives have pulled out of Wednesday's season launch of the Champions Cup in Cardiff, prompting European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) to consider taking action against the English Premiership club.</p>
      <p>European and English champions Saracens were docked 35 points and fined Â£5.36 million by the Premiership on Tuesday after being found guilty of breaching salary cap regulations.</p>

      <p>"EPCR is disappointed to learn of Saracens' decision to make their club representatives unavailable for today's official 2019/20 Season Launch of the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup in Cardiff," Champions Cup organisers EPCR said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"EPCR will now consider what action is appropriate in this instance and will be making no further comment at this time."</p>
      <p>Saracens said on Tuesday they were "shocked and disappointed" with the sanctions imposed by the English Premiership and will appeal against the punishment.</p>
      <p>The club will begin their European title defence against Racing 92 in Pool 4 on Nov. 17.</p>
