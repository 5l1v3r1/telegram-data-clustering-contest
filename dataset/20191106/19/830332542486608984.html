      <p>"Thank you to the members of the community, local and regional leaders for participating in the EIS and NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) process in regards to the selection of Truax Field as the proposed alternative for basing the next operational squadron of F-35As," 115th Fighter Wing commander Col. Erik Peterson said. "We are grateful for the tremendous amount of public involvement and support for the 115th Fighter Wing, our mission and our airmen. We truly value the feedback and input shared by all members of the community as well as our local, state and federal elected officials."</p>
