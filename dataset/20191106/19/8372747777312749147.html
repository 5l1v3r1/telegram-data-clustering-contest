      <p>Nine-year-old boys usually spend their birthday money on toys or video games, but one Florida boy decided to do something different.</p>
      <p>Parker Williams got $15 for his birthday and instead of buying something for himself, he decided to give his teacher at Gorrie Elementary in Tampa a pay raise.</p>
      <p>"I think more people should be nice because it's a nicer thing to do than being mean," Williams told <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/tampa-third-grader-uses-birthday-money-to-give-teacher-a-pay-raise-says-her-job-is-important/">CNN affiliate WFLA.</a> "I think she's a really kind teacher...and she spends time on everybody."</p>
      <p>Williams gave his teacher the money along with a note that said: "Dear Mrs. Chambers, I don't think that teachers get paid enough for what they do, so, will you accept this gift?"</p>
      <p>Williams' parents didn't know about the third-grader's plan and his mom said her eyes welled up with tears.</p>
      <p>They found the note afterward with Mary Hall Chambers' kind response: "I can't accept this but appreciate the gesture, Parker. Students like you are the reason I teach."</p>
      <p>Even though his teacher didn't keep the gift, Williams said he still felt like he paid it forward. "It made me feel really nice and good," he said.</p>
      <p>Parker's dad Darrell Williams put the note on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215165929689301&amp;set=a.1048031128733&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Facebook page, </a>where it quickly made the rounds.</p>
