      <h1>Meet the flying taxi that could revolutionise how we move around</h1>

      <p>A futuristic flying taxi with the potential to revolutionise where we choose to live could be airborne in little more than five years it’s been claimed.</p>
      <p>Munich-based start-up Lilium has just successfully completed the first stage of flight testing for its all-electric prototype.</p>
      <p>It wants commercial services for its aircraft — which take off and land vertically — to begin in “several locations worldwide” by 2025.</p>
      <p>Lilium said the jet will have a top speed of 300 kilometres-per-hour — making it the fastest all-electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.</p>
      <p>“Think what this means to our lives and countries,” said Lilium co-founder and CEO Daniel Wiegand.</p>
      <p>“Suddenly we can live in the countryside and work in the cities.</p>
      <p>“And instead of making all these infrastructure investments [for traditional transport] we can redirect public spending into other areas.”</p>
      <p>Wiegand, speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on Wednesday, said the jet needed just a small concrete surface to land and take off from, which included a charging facility.</p>
      <p>He also said the jet will be emissions-free, silent and able to travel 300 kilometres on a single charge.</p>
      <p>Their take-up would potentially allow pressure to be taken off major cities, which are forecast to have two billion more people living in them by 2050.</p>
      <p>“I think globally we’re facing several problems at the same time,” said Wiegand. “One of them is our population is growing, which automatically triggers more transportation need.</p>
      <p>“The second thing is in the cities we’re creating a problem of congestion, we need more roads as they get bigger.</p>
      <p>“This is why there is a desperate need for something that connects us faster.</p>
      <p>“Of course, we can do this on the ground with high-speed rail, but it would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
      <p>“And this is why we think there is such a demand for something like we do.”</p>
