      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- What a lip-smacking offer!</p>
      <p>Anyone with unpaid parking fines at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus has the option to reduce or cover the cost of their tickets with peanut butter and jelly.</p>
      <p>KTUU-TV reported the university would take donations for their annual payment tradition until Nov. 8 to help combat student hunger.</p>
      <p>Officials say the food goes to students in need.</p>
      <p>University officials say each person could use PB&amp;J payments for two citations issued within the past 45 days.</p>
      <p>Officials say two 16-ounce (454-gram) jars offer a $10 credit, three jars offer a $35 credit and five jars offer a $60 credit.</p>
      <p>Officials say any unopened commercially produced nut butter-almond, cashew, peanut butter or any flavour jam, jelly, marmalade or preserves would be accepted.</p>
