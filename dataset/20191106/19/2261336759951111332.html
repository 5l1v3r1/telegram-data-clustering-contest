      <p>Johnny Walker has said he only has himself to blame after suffering his first UFC loss this past weekend to Corey Anderson at UFC 244.</p>

      <p>Walker (17-4) suffered a first round TKO loss to Anderson at UFC 244 in New York this past weekend. The Brazilian had previously won his last three UFC appearances all by impressive finishes, earning $50,000 bonuses for all of them.</p>
      <p>Talking to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/5/20948126/johnny-walker-ufc-244-loss-corey-anderson-shogun-rua-paul-craig-mma">MMA Fighting</a> about the loss, Walker said focusing too much on the takedown threat from Anderson didn’t allow him to fight his own game.</p>
      <p>“I know it was my mistake,” Walker said. “I hesitated too much. I should have been more aggressive, but I didn’t. I had too many people talking about his takedowns, so I waited for him to shoot, and I didn’t let my game go. It was the wrong strategy. I should have listened to myself. I listened to everyone else but me. That was my mistake. I regret that.</p>
      <p>“I should have gone for the knockout right away like I always do, but I ended up changing my game and everything went wrong. But it’s alright – I’m ready for the next one.”</p>
      <p>Walker’s loss was something that drew criticism from fellow light heavyweight <a href="https://twitter.com/jonnybones/status/1190807524204695552?s=21">Jon Jones.</a> Regardless of the backlash he has received from the loss, Walker is planning to return to the octagon against the winner of Shogun Rua vs. Paul Craig at UFC São Paulo later this month.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be there (at UFC Sao Paulo) to watch it as a guest fighter,” Walker said. “I know that two more wins will get me back to where I was, so I’m not too off the rails. I’ll be back soon. It was a learning experience. I won’t ever hesitate in a fight again, brother. Never.”</p>
