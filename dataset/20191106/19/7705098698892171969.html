      <h1>The Mandalorian Pays Tribute To Classic Star Wars In New Footage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:42:10+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>In just under a week, the new <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> series, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a>, premieres on Disney+. And to keep the hype moving along, a new “One Week” trailer is here, complete with some new footage. There are some highlights worth noting, which first debuted on the <a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1192109389047447553?s=20"><b>Star Wars</b> Twitter account</a>. First off, fans hear more from Werner Herzog’s character, a powerful man who speaks to Pedro Pascal’s Mandalorian. He talks about a “revolution” that brings “nothing but chaos,” in the face of the Empire’s collapse.</p>
      <p>The trailer also provides a closer look at the Mandalorian’s spacecraft, a sleekly designed ship that can kick into hyperspace with ease. There’s even a glimpse of it making its way across the galaxy with the classic “zoom” effect.</p>
      <p>But the real fun comes in its closing seconds. The Mandalorian comes across a few unfavorable types in a cantina, in a scene similar to 0ne from the original <b>Star Wars</b>. However, instead of playing it cautiously, the Mandalorian comes out swinging. </p>

      <p>Most of the show’s story is still under wraps, even with the revealed characters and setting. But it won’t be long before fans can find out what happens next.</p>
