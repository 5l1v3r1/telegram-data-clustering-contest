        <b>BERLIN (Sputnik) - Deutsche Welle has welcomed a remark by top Russian diplomat Sergei Lavrov, who said the Foreign Ministry did not entertain the idea of stripping foreign media of their Russian licenses.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Deutsche Welle welcomes the announcement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that Russia does not see restrictions on Western media, including Deutsche Welle, as necessary or possible", the broadcaster said.</blockquote>
      <p>The media’s spokesman, Christoph Jumpelt, said that sanctions on <i>Deutsche Welle</i> would not have been justified. He denied that the outlet had apologised for the offending tweet, saying there must have been some kind of misunderstanding. </p>
      <p>The report comes after the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201908081076505990-moscow-says-deutsche-welles-actions-are-attempt-to-interfere-in-russias-affairs/">state-run German broadcaster struck up fury</a> in summer with a tweet in Russian that seemed to back the unauthorised protests against the exclusion of opposition candidates from a Moscow council race.</p>
      <p>The head of a Russian parliamentary committee probing foreign meddling said he would ask the Foreign Ministry to consider barring Deutsche Welle from operating in Russia.</p>
