      <h1>New York man arrested for allegedly dousing 2 NYPD officers with water over the summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:05:06+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author">Travis Fedschun</a></address>
      <p>A man in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">New York City</a> was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">arrested</a> Monday in connection with an incident over the summer that went viral when two <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">police officers</a> were doused with water as they were making an arrest, officials said.</p>
      <p>The New York Police Department said Darnell Hilliard, 21, was arrested at his home in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast">Harlem</a>, more than three months after the attack in July, according to a police report.</p>
      <p>The incident on July 20 went viral after a video posted to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter">Twitter</a> showed officers in Harlem getting drenched as they were making an arrest. In one video, somebody hurled a bucket that hit an officer in the head while he was arresting someone. Groups of jeering bystanders could be heard reacting as people continued to splash the officers with water.</p>

      <p>New York City Police say Hillard was seen in one of the videos, which drew outrage from police unions and even President Trump, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-out-deblasio-after-water-tossed-on-nypd-officers-should-act-immediately">who called for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to “act immediately”</a> in response to the acts seen on the videos. Officials had previously said that a total of 15 people were recorded in the video.</p>
      <p>Two other people are <a href="https://twitter.com/NYPDChiefofDept/status/1154057353836322822">facing charges</a> in connection with the Harlem incident, which at the time the NYPD <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-police-pelted-objects-drenched-water-video-reprehensible">called “reprehensible."</a></p>

      <p>Hilliard was charged by police with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration, riot, assault, disorderly conduct and harassment.</p>
      <p>But at his arraignment on Monday, prosecutors only brought some of those charges against the 21-year-old, dropping the riot charge and changing his assault charge to attempted assault, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-suspect-arrested-officer-water-dousing-harlem-20191106-aode6bxfxzhxtp3mk65yq6aftm-story.html">the New York Daily News reported</a>. He remains held on $2,500 bail and is in court again on Friday, according to the newspaper.</p>
