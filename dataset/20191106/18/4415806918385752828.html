      <p>Revenue officers have seized more than €27,000 in cash, 39,000 cigarettes and two dogs in three searches yesterday.</p>
      <p>Officers at Shannon Airport searched the checked-in luggage of an Irish national in her 30s flying to Malaga.</p>
      <p>They found two bundles of cash hidden as a Christmas present.</p>
      <p>Today, Revenue officers were granted a three-month cash detention order on the €27,000 at Ennis District Court.</p>

      <p>Also yesterday, officers seized around 39,000 unstamped cigarettes when they stopped and searched a passenger’s luggage at Shannon Airport.</p>
      <p>The ‘Benson &amp; Hedges’ branded cigarettes have an estimated retail value of around €24,900.</p>
      <p>They interviewed the Nigerian woman in her 40s who had arrived off a flight from Abuja, Nigeria, with the cigarettes, and investigations are ongoing.</p>
      <p>Also yesterday, Revenue officers at Dublin Port seized two dogs when they stopped and questioned a man and a woman who were travelling to the UK.</p>
      <p>The dogs, who did not have pet passports as required under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, were discovered in the boot of the car.</p>
