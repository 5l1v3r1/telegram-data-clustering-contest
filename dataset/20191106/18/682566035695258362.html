      <p>Cape Town - TV presenter and Motorsport analyst <b>Eddie Jordan</b> has explained the reasons why he thinks <b>Lewis Hamilton </b>has "already surpassed" <b>Michael Schumacher.</b></p>
      <p>Hamilton clinched his sixth Drivers' Championship at Sunday's United States Grand Prix, bringing his W10 home in second place after Valtteri Bottas made a late pass for the win.</p>
      <p>His sixth time means he is now just one behind Schumacher on the all-time list while also trailing the German 83 race wins to 91.</p>
      <p>But while the numbers still proclaim Schumacher to be the best, Jordan feels Hamilton is in a different league.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has their own view on this, but I am of the view he's already surpassed Michael," the former F1 team boss toldÂ <i>talkSPORT</i>.</p>
      <p>"Michael started with me so there is a love affair there, but there is a situation some people may not fully grasp.</p>
      <p>"At the time I handled people like [Rubens] Barrichello, [Eddie] Irvine, [Giancarlo] Fisichella and [Jean] Alesi, and every time we went to sign a contract with Michael Schumacher or Ferrari it always had conditions in it, where what we saw in Austin wouldn't have been allowed to happen.</p>
      <p>"Lewis, if he had in his contract the same things, he would have had to been able to pass [Valtteri] Bottas [to win the race].</p>
      <p>"You can't have that in a competitive sport, where one part of the team dictates to the other.</p>
      <p>"For me, that is a flaw factor for Michael.</p>
      <p>"Seven World Championships... how many would he have won if he hadn't had the influence and support of the other people in the team?</p>
      <p>"And I'm not just talking about team members - I'm talking about the drivers.</p>
      <p>"Lewis is already in a different league, in my opinion. He's done it on his own.</p>
      <p>"What he has done has brought great pride to his family and his people, and he can be justifiably proud."</p>
