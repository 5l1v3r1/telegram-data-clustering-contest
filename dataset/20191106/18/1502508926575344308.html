      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>on Wednesday rolled out a feature that will let users decide who can add them to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>groups</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to enable the feature</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Go to settings in your app</p>
      <p>2. Tap Account&gt; Privacy &gt; Groups</p>
      <p>3. Select one of three options: 'Everyone,' 'My Contacts,' or 'My Contacts Except'</p>
      <p>‘My Contacts’ means only users you have in your address book can add you to groups and ‘My Contacts Except’ provides additional control for who among your contacts can add you to a group</p>
