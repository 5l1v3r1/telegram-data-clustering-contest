      <h1>Former Cork City striker Sheppard signs for Shelbourne</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:48:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/stephen-barry/" target="_blank">By Stephen Barry</a></address>
      <p>Former Cork City striker Karl Sheppard has signed for Shelbourne.</p>
      <p>Sheppard returns to the club where he spent time as a schoolboy before moving to England in 2007.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old had been a regular presence for City since joining ahead of the 2015 season, winning one league title and two FAI Cups.</p>
      <p>He was one of five City players who appeared on the PFAI's transfer list, made up of players out of contract following the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Conor McCormack, Garry Buckley, Colm Horgan, and Aaron Barry, who was on loan at Bohemians this season, also featured on the list.</p>
      <p>Shelbourne, who won the First Division this year, are strengthening ahead of their return to the top flight for the first time in seven years.</p>
      <p>“I kept a close eye on Shels since I left them as a schoolboy and last season,” said Sheppard.</p>
      <p>“They’re the first club I ever went to as a boy so I have always had a soft spot for them.</p>
      <p>“Ian [Morris, manager] got in contact with me and told me about the plans for the season and I wanted to be apart of it.”</p>
