      <h1>After Pakistan, Nepal also cries foul over new Indian map</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:23:14+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>KATHMANDU: </b>Nepal has objected to a new map released by India that places the disputed area of Kalapani within Delhi’s borders, saying it was “clear” the territory belonged to Kathmandu.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, India released the new map following its decision to split occupied Kashmir into two administrative territories.</p>
      <p>On the map, India’s border cuts into Kalapani, long a source of contention between the two countries, particularly because Indian troops have been deployed in the area for more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>Nepal “is committed to protecting its international border,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>“Any border-related issue relating to the two friendly countries needs to be resolved through diplomatic channels on the basis of historical documents and evidence.”</p>
      <p>“The Nepal government will not accept any unilateral decision,” it added.</p>
      <p>An 1816 treaty established Nepal’s western boundary with India along the Kali River, but border disputes have arisen over a discrepancy between the two sides over where the source of the river is located.</p>
      <p>Rajan Bhattarai, the foreign relations advisor to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, said a solution would be sought through talks.</p>
      <p>“We have to verify the authenticity of the map and examine the borderline from our concerned authorities and experts.</p>
      <p>Then we will start talks using our diplomatic channels,” Bhattarai said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Pakistan had also<a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2092741/1-incorrect-legally-untenable-pakistan-rejects-political-maps-issued-india/"> rejected</a> the political map displaying IOK within the territorial jurisdiction of India as “incorrect, legally untenable, void and in complete violation of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions”.</p>
