      <p>Salah and the Egyptian Football Association have endured a fractured relationship over the past few years, and the 27-year-old has seemingly been dealt another slight after being overlooked for the captain's armband.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Liverpool Echo,</i> Ahmed Fathi has been retained as the Pharaohs' captain after the veteran defender reportedly refused to relinquish his role within the national team.</p>

      <p>Head coach Hossam El-Badry, who assumed the role after Egypt's disappointing 2019 Africa Cup of Nations campaign, has now confirmed that Salah will not be the nation's new captain.</p>
      <p>"The decision of the armband is the responsibility of the manager," El-Badry said.</p>
      <p>"There are no problems between Salah and Fathi. In the end, we decided the armband will go to the oldest player."</p>
