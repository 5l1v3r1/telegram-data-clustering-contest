      <p>A reporter for the College Fix attended a Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) rally at the University of Minnesota on Sunday to <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/watch-liberal-college-students-cant-name-one-democratic-accomplishment/">ask</a> leftist college students if they could name a Democratic accomplishment from the past three years.</p>
      <p>Most of the students were unable to name a single accomplishment.</p>

      <p>“Over the last three years, what is one thing the Democratic party has accomplished?” reporter Kyle Hooten asked leftist students.</p>
      <p>“I guess they have taken back the house but, I mean, they are not that good at using their authority or their power,” one student said.</p>
      <p>“I felt they haven’t really done much over three years but that might have been because Trump has been in office,” one student said.</p>
      <p>“I would say Bernie Sanders igniting his passion in people,” one student said. When Hooten pressed the student for a “tangible accomplishment,” the student had nothing to say.</p>
