      <p>Over €170,000 worth of cannabis was seized in an elaborate double growhouse at a house in Dunmanway but today a 22-year-old woman who was living there avoided jail as her role was described as peripheral.</p>
      <p>Judge Seán Ó'Donnabháin said that he was satisfied to impose an entirely suspended five-year sentence on Abi Farthing even though she faced the possibility of a mandatory minimum jail term. The judge said there were several exceptional circumstances enabling him to do so at Cork Circuit Criminal Court.</p>
      <p>Farthing, 22, pleaded guilty to having more than €13,000 worth of cannabis for sale or supply at Derragh, Dunmanway, County Cork, on January 18, 2016.</p>
      <p>The €13,000 threshold allows for a possible minimum jail term of 10 years unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p>The judge noted that the defendant went to Portugal after the drugs were discovered and that the authorities had now succeeded in bringing them back to Ireland.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Abi Farthing absconded, the judge noted that the prosecution was not objecting to her being remanded on bail previously.</p>
      <p>Her senior counsel, Elizabeth O’Connell, said the defendant was only a teenager at the time the drugs were found and she had no previous convictions.</p>
      <p>Detective Garda Andrew Manning said gardaí were aware of the names of other older defendants when they arrived with a warrant to search the house and that Abi Farthing had not been previously known to the guards.</p>
      <p>She had been in a relationship with one of the men at the house.</p>

      <p>Two elaborate growhouses with lighting and watering systems were found at the house containing drugs to a total value of €170,000, between mature plants in one growhouse and harvested cannabis being dried out from the second unit.</p>
      <p>Surmising from the probation report on the accused and her degree of maturity, Judge Ó Donnabháin said of Abi Farthing, “At the time she was 19, going on 14-and-a-half.”</p>
