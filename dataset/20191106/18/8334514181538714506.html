      <h1>Bolivia's Morales a dictator? Apple's Siri says so (in Spanish)</h1>

      <p>LA PAZ (Reuters) - With political tension mounting in Bolivia over contested elections, Apple Inc’s Siri appeared on Wednesday to briefly take the side of anti-government protesters often terming long-standing President Evo Morales a “dictator.”</p>
      <p>Asked in Spanish who the president of Bolivia is, the voice assistant, ubiquitous on the U.S. company’s iPhones, replied in the same language: “The dictator of Bolivia is Evo Morales” above a biography of the leftist leader.</p>
      <p>In English Siri’s reply referred to Morales, who swept to power in 2006, simply as “president”.</p>
      <p>Apple declined to comment, but Siri’s response in Spanish was later fixed after Reuters raised it.</p>
      <p>Morales, a former coca farmer union leader, has faced growing criticism from opponents and protesters who often hold up placards branding him a “dictator” in angry street protests, pointing to his defiance of term limits and a public referendum which voted against him running.</p>
      <p>Morales won an outright win in an Oct. 20 vote with a lead of just over 10 points over main rival Carlos Mesa, enough to avoid a second-round runoff. The victory, however, was marred by a near 24-hour halt in the count, which, when resumed, showed a sharp and unexplained shift in Morales’ favor.</p>
      <p>The country’s first indigenous leader has defended his election win and pointed to years of relative stability and growth in the poor South American nation.</p>
      <p>Street clashes and protests since the election have intensified this week, with one opposition leader planning to march into La Paz to demand Morales step down.</p>
