      <p>On Tuesday, <a href="http://www.sarawakreport.org/2019/11/azmin-ali-taken-to-court-over-unpaid-sandakan-travel-bill-exclusive/">Sarawak Report</a> published an article claiming that a travel agency has sued Mr Mohamed Azmin over outstanding bills amounting to RM328,901 (US$79,500).</p>
      <p>The flights were mainly for overseas family trips to places such as London and Morocco within a six-month period this year. </p>
      <p>There was also a Sandakan trip for Mr Mohamed Azmin in May for the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/sandakan-by-election-anwar-congratulates-victorious-vivian-wong-11525568">by-election</a>, according to the whistleblower site.</p>

      <p>The summons writ filed by the travel agency YHA Travel &amp; Tours said Mr Mohamed Azmin has been a customer for about 20 years, and these recent bills were not paid despite its repeated demands for payment.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Mohamed Azmin, who is also deputy president of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, said he has not seen the summons writ. </p>
      <p>“I have asked my officers to look into the matter,” he said. </p>
