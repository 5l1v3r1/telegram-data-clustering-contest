      <p>In an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma, Phakamani Mahlambi opened up about his relationship with Pitso Mosimane, admitting that they ‘fight’ every day.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has had a slow start to the 2019/20 campaign dealing with injury troubles which has seen him feature just four times for the Brazilians so far. </p>

      <p>Now, with Mauricio Affonso and Jose Ali Meza coming in to the fold, it has been tough for the young striker to break back into the team. </p>
      <p>However, in an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma this week, Mahlambi revealed how much of a role Mosimane plays in his everyday life at Sundowns as he looks to get back on track with his form.</p>
      <p>“Me and the coach fight every day. Not like in a bad way, because he wants the best out of me. So, every day, we are fighting,” Mahlambi said.</p>
      <p>“There’s no day that passes without him shouting at me or without him calling me. I feel like it’s a relationship between a father and a son, with the tough love inside for me to do good. He wants to see me being the best player – that’s what he told me and that’s what he is working towards. I’m happy because if he does not shout at me, maybe I will feel like he is not a good coach anymore. We fight, but I feel like it’s good,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mahlambi also opens up on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How his confidence has taken a knock…</li>
        <li>His relationship with Gavin Hunt at Bidvest Wits…</li>
        <li>His ambitions of returning to play overseas…</li>
      </ul>
