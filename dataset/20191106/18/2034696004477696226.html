        <b>"I just wanted to make a movie exactly like the first..."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Director Roland Emmerich, who helmed the 2016 film <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/first-trailer-for-independence-day-resurgence-rele-871812"><i>Independence Day: Resurgence</i></a>, has said that he now considers the sequel a mistake.</p>
      <p>The sequel to 1996’s <i>Independence</i> <i>Day</i>, also directed by Emmerich, opened to poor reviews and holds a paltry 29% approval rating on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/independence_day_resurgence">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. It grossed $389.7 million internationally, far less than was hoped.</p>
      <p>“It’s undeniably visually impressive, but like its predecessor, <i>Independence Day: Resurgence</i> lacks enough emotional heft to support its end-of-the-world narrative stakes,” reads the site’s critical consensus.</p>

      <p>Speaking while promoting his new Second World War movie <i>Midway</i>, Emmerich said he regrets not halting the production after Will Smith departed to film <i>Suicide Squad</i>.</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to make a movie exactly like the first, but then in the middle of production Will opted out because he wanted to do <i>Suicide Squad,</i>” Emmerich told <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/independence-day-director-roland-emmerich-regrets-making-sequel-170655100.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2VudHJhbHRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9kaXJlY3Rvci1jYWxscy1saWFtLWhlbXN3b3J0aC1maWxtLWEtbWlzdGFrZS8zODcyMzc2Lw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI-xaI3U1xgLiEg-s5FV3fg1cxRbqhwJoYLpwVPVFRL3jBsfnsHp3jw1e4SYxK5H10Y_e73ogJfv47hxOUV06vYMlfoQvlYL_VOtRcSzk2UMrkKoHEkFYBBm5_-5BTYe8QOgQp_7c3sohNu5U3zefXCdWp9hfbR7d71V_egQSV0g">Yahoo Movies UK</a>.</p>
      <p>He continued: “I should have stopped making the movie because we had a much better script, then I had to really fast, cobble another script together.”</p>
      <p>“I should have just said no because all of a sudden I was making something I criticised myself: a sequel.”</p>
      <p>Although Smith, the star of the original <i>Independence Day</i> dropped out, <i>Resurgence </i>did manage to keep his co-star Jeff Goldblum on board, alongside new additions Liam Hemsworth and Jessie Usher.</p>
