      <p><i>"There are some new opportunities, or different opportunities,"</i> Kubica said after the United States Grand Prix last weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We'll have to see if we can make it work. If this happens I can have a good and relaxed December, but until [then], there is no final decision and [I] have to look realistically.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Until there is no signature on the papers it's better to be realistic. It's maybe more complicated than I would like but if it's more complicated it means there are some good opportunities."</i>
