      <h1>Chinese Communists Infiltrate British Universities, Impose Censorship</h1>
      <h2>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is conducting a propaganda war in university halls across the United Kingdom, using threats and intimidation to implement a pro-Beijing narrative on campus.</h2>

      <p>The Foreign Affairs Committee has published a <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201920/cmselect/cmfaff/109/109.pdf">report</a> on the influence that the Confucius Institute exerts on professors and students at universities in the United Kingdpm.</p>
      <p>The Confucius Institute, which purports to teach Chinese language and culture, is a branch of the Chinese Ministry of Education which reports <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/30/belgium-bars-chinese-professor-suspected-spying-beijing/">directly</a> to the Communist Party’s central propaganda department.</p>
      <p>The United Kingdom has 29 Confucius Institutes, the second-highest number in any country — behind the United States — with an additional 148 “<a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/05/05/chinas-overseas-confucius-institutes-pose-powerful-threat-academic-freedom/">Confucius Classrooms</a>” across the country.</p>
      <p>London School of Economics (LSE) professor Christopher Hughes told the Foreign Affairs Committee that he had witnessed “Chinese Confucius Institute officials confiscating papers which mention Taiwan at an academic conference”.</p>
      <p>Another example occurred at the University of Nottingham, in which professors were pressured to cancel campus events that related to Taiwan and Tibet following complaints from Chinese officials.</p>

      <p>Professor Hughes, writing in 2014, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35434291.pdf">explained</a> that the Confucius Institutes not only serve as a means of stifling discussion about sensitive topics for the Beijing regime, such as the so-called ‘Three T’s’ — Taiwan, Tibet, Tiananmen — but also serves as an apparatus to watch over Chinese students who are studying abroad.</p>
      <p>One student told Professor Hughes: “The Confucius Institute, to me, functions like the closed circulation television and has the potential to scare away my critical thinking by constantly reminding me: we are watching you and behave yourself.”</p>
      <p>Another student, Ayeshagul Nur Ibrahim, a Uyghur Muslim, told the Foreign Affairs Committee that the Chinese Communist Party has been harassing her and her family since she became politically active in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The Confucius Institute has recently come under increased criticism in the West. Last month, <i>The Telegraph</i> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/30/belgium-bars-chinese-professor-suspected-spying-beijing/">reported</a> that Xinning Song, the head of the Confucius Institute at the Free University of Brussels, was banned from Belgium after security services accused him of being a spy for Beijing. He was also barred from the European Union’s passport-free Schengen zone for eight years.</p>
      <p>In the United States, Republican Senator Josh Hawley has called for a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/10/09/josh-hawley-calls-for-oversight-on-chinas-influence-on-american-colleges/">federal investigation</a> into China’s influence on American education. Hawley said: “These Confucius Institutes are, in short, a tool for China to spread influence and exercise soft power in its rivalry with the United States.”</p>
      <p>The claim by Senator Hawley is backed up by former Chinese president Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping’s predecessor, who <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/05/05/chinas-overseas-confucius-institutes-pose-powerful-threat-academic-freedom/">said</a> that the purpose of the institutes is “to cultivate and prepare a group (or army) of people to make sure the CCP will be in power in the future… and increase our CCP influence around the world.”</p>
