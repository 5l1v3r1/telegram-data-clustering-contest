      <p>French actor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/CatherineDeneuve">Catherine Deneuve</a> was admitted to a hospital in Paris after a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/stroke">stroke</a>, according to her family.</p>
      <p>Newspaper <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/catherine-deneuve-hospitalisee-apres-un-malaise-06-11-2019-8187297.php"><i>Le Parisien</i></a> reported on Wednesday that Deneuve, 76, had fallen ill overnight.</p>
      <p>The actor, who became France’s leading screen actor and a top international star in the Sixties, was in a “serious state”, added the newspaper.</p>
      <p>A family source told the French newspaper <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/culture/catherine-deneuve-hospitalisee-dans-un-etat-serieux-6597249"><i>Ouest-France</i></a> that Deneuve had suffered from a “very limited” transient ischemic attack (TIA), a type of stroke that happens when the blood flow to the brain is temporarily blocked.</p>
      <p>According to a statement by Deneuve’s agent quoted by <i>Ouest-France</i>, Deneuve’s condition is expected to be reversible.</p>
      <p>While TIAs are sometimes referred to as “mini strokes” due to the fact that they don’t seem to cause lasting damage, they can be warning signs of a potential, more serious incident, and therefore should be treated seriously, according to the <a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/tia-transient-ischemic-attack/what-is-a-tia">American Stroke Association</a>.</p>
      <p>Deneuve had been busy filming a new film titled <i>De Son Vivant </i>by actor and filmmaker Emmanuelle Bercot​.</p>
