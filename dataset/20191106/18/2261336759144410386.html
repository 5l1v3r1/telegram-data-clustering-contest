      <p>UFC light heavyweight prospect Johnny Walker had a bone to pick with Dan Hardy. All of it was rooted to Hardy’s claims of Walker taunting opponent Corey Anderson right before their fight at UFC 244 on Saturday.</p>

      <blockquote>To Johnny Walker, and anyone else that was upset with the comments I made regarding the taunting backstage… <br/><br/>After seeing the tension between the two fighters before they walked out, the reaction from Corey after the fight, as well as a conversation with members of the corner team, it was my understanding that mind games had been played. If I am incorrect, then I apologize. <br/><br/>I didn’t say it as a negative characteristic of Johnny’s, but a part of the game, and the story around the fight. Those of you that remember me as a fighter will know that I loved a bit of trash-talking. <br/><br/>In the unique atmosphere backstage, there was ample opportunity for fighters to interact before walking out. I was under the impression that something had taken place. It wasn’t my intention to pass on incorrect information. <br/><br/>I’m sure Johnny isn’t the kind of fighter to taunt his opponents, and (I) apologize for giving you that impression.</blockquote>

      <p>Anderson ended up victorious via first-round knockout, a win that he feels <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/5/20948955/ufc-244-anderson-states-case-for-title-shot-my-win-is-more-relevant-than-reyes-over-weidman-mma-news">catapults him in front of the line</a> of contenders to face current champion Jon Jones.</p>
