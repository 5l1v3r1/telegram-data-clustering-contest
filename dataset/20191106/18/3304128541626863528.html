      <p>An event promoter based in the United States has called out singer Esther Akoth for allegedly lying about not receiving payment after her performance.</p>
      <p>According to the events organizer, Sarah Okindo, madam boss as she is commonly referred to was reimbursed for her services and also received funds for her Akothee Foundation.</p>
      <p>Ms Okindo invited the “single mothers’ president” to the States in October. Akothee was picked up in a rented Toyota Land Cruiser from the airport.</p>
      <p>In a receipt seen by this writer, Okindo rented the car from October 31 to November 3 at a cost of Sh72,000.</p>

      <p>But according to the hitmaker, the organizer picked her up from the airport accompanied by her children. The car, she complained was too crowded.</p>
      <p>“…you came to the airport with your family with just one car 🙈well I love children so it wasn’t a problem for me,but we could hardly fit in🙊, you checked me into a budget hotel, I still kept my calm, I was tired so I slept,” the singer recounted.</p>
      <p>She was then booked into a low budget hotel, Fairfield Inn Marriott Blaine, that has only been operational for six months now. The hotel cost Okindo Sh4,200.</p>

      <p>Again, Okindo in a series of WhatsApp messages with Akothee asks her to create a CashApp account through which willing donors would contribute to the foundation.</p>
      <p>So impressed was Akothee with her management skills that she asked to work closely with her. This was after Okindo advised the Lotto singer to allocate every state a project.</p>
      <p>Denying the claims, the mother of five said the “Esther Akothee” in the text exchange is not her. She did however acknowledge receiving Sh500,000 from Rumba Notes Lounge – a club at which she performed while on the US tour.</p>
      <p>The monies she said were from the fans. They will be used for the borehole project under the Akothee Foundation.</p>
      <p>“I still dint recieve the donations you said you had from your rich friends as reported by my manager 🙏🏾 I have total of 5000 usd from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rumbanotes/">@rumbanotes</a> fans and Family for for the borehole project <a href="https://www.instagram.com/akotheefoundation/">@akotheefoundation</a> 🙏🏾<a href="https://www.instagram.com/rumbanotes/">@rumbanotes</a> also took charge of my expenses during my stay in America ,including your failed flights (sic),” Akothee complained.</p>

      <p>Okindo also admitted that the event had its own hiccups, but she made paid the artiste in full.</p>
      <p>Akothee has also accused the promoter of abandoning her and her manager. She also notes that she has never been in direct communication with Okindo.</p>
      <p>“Wait a minute, are you kidding me? who is Sara talking too with the name Esther Akothee ? Yet he demanded to talk to the Artist directly after cancelling the tickets and hotel 🤷‍♂️🙆‍♂️ wait I am going crazy now. What is this woman talking about , when was this which number is this ,what’s cash ap (sic),” she wrote.</p>
      <p>In a lengthy Instagram post, Akothee maintains that Okindo could have been conned in her name.</p>
