      <h1>K-Electric chairman Ikram Sehgal resigns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:46:35+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/138/salman-siddiqui/" target="_blank">Salman Siddiqui</a></address>
      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Ikram Sehgal has tendered his resignation from the post of K-Electric chairman following differences between him and board directors widened apparently over some of the issues related to the company’s business strategy.</p>
      <p>“Board members have taken decisions on certain issues which I do not support,” Sehgal, who had assumed the chairmanship of K-Electric in January 2019, said while talking to <i>The Express Tribune</i> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Almost all directors on the board were on one side (excluding me),” he said, adding that it had become morally unjustified for him to continue.</p>
      <p>He, however, declined to share specific details of the decisions which widened the differences. “It would be unethical and morally incorrect to share such details,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sehgal added that it was not justifiable to continue as the chairman in the public as well as national interest. “It is high time to quit the chairmanship of K-Electric,” he stated.</p>
      <p>He reiterated that he would continue serving Pakistan’s interests where and when required but at the moment it was better to disassociate.</p>
      <p>Speculations suggested that differences had developed over the timing of establishing an imported gas (re-gasified liquefied natural gas) based 900-megawatt power plant by the company.</p>
      <p>The board was divided whether the new plant should be set up by the current management or the expected new Chinese management, which is likely to take over K-Electric when it gets all the regulatory approvals which have remained pending for about three years.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, K-Electric’s share price increased 1.3%, or Rs0.05, to Rs3.91 with trading in 14.7 million shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX).</p>
      <p>K-Electric announced Sehgal’s resignation decision in a notice sent to the PSX in the dying moments of the trading session.</p>
      <p>“Director/chairman of the board Ikram Ul-Majeed Sehgal has resigned from the directorship of the company with effect from November 6, 2019,” the company notified.</p>
      <p>Sehgal’s appointment as K-Electric chairman back in January 2019 was considered to accelerate the long pending sale of K-Electric’s majority stake to China’s state-owned Shanghai Electric Power by the crisis-hit Abraaj Group. His resignation is feared to again slow down the acquisition process.</p>
