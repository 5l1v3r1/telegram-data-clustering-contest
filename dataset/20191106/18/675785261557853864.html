      <h2>The French World Cup winner has been out of action since the 1-1 draw against Arsenal at Old Trafford on September 30 but United are hopeful that he will return to first-team training soon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:38:37+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says "it won't be too long" before Paul Pogba returns from his ongoing ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The French World Cup winner has been out of action for the Red Devils since the 1-1 draw against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> at Old Trafford on September 30.</p>
      <p>Since then, United have recorded three wins, two draws and two defeats in the seven games they've played in the star midfielder's abensce.</p>
      <p>United are in somewhat of a miserable run of form, having suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on Saturday, and Solskjaer is hoping to call upon Pogba in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>"He (Pogba) said it himself," the Norwegian head coach told a press conference. "It won’t be too long until he’s out of his cast. He’ll work hard during the international break and hopefully, he’ll be back."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Solskjaer wants his players to 'fill their boots' in the Europa League against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday.</p>
      <p>United are looking to bounce back from another disappointing result in the Premier League with defeat to Bournemouth on Saturday by qualifying for the knockout stages of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's side have taken seven points from their three games so far but have only scored two goals, while they have managed more than one goal in a Premier League game on just two occasions this season.</p>

      <p>The Norwegian said: "We'll have to start tomorrow and hope Partizan don't remember this with joy.</p>
      <p>"I played in quite a few games at home and if you get a good start you can fill your boots and hopefully we can get off to a good start tomorrow. Front-foot football.</p>
      <p>"We've had so many games where we've been 1-0 up and now it's about, come on, let's go for the second and third because maybe we've taken a step back and said we need to get the result for me, and I'd rather these boys just go for and make a mistake or two."</p>
