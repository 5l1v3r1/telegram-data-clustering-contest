      <h1>Murder suspects who escaped California jail captured</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:34:14+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/" target="_blank">Chelcey Adami, Salinas Californian</a></address>
      <p>SALINAS, Calif. –Two murder suspects who <a href="http://bit.ly/32nkze7">escaped from the Monterey County Jail</a> in California on Sunday were captured.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2019/11/04/information-escaped-murder-suspects-california-monterey-county-jail/4156688002/">Santos Samuel Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20,</a> were locked up at the jail, facing murder charges in separate cases.</p>
      <p>They escaped by <a href="https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2019/11/04/sheriff-speaks-sureno-gang-murder-suspects-monterey-county-jail-escape/4157786002/">creating a hole in the ceiling</a>, going through a maintenance gap and kicking open a hatch blocked by construction, said Capt. John Thornburg with the Monterey County Sheriff's Office at a news conference Monday.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office announced Wednesday morning that both suspects were arrested. Sheriff's detectives took them back to Monterey County, the sheriff's office wrote on Facebook. </p>
      <p>Salinas police said Salazar was with La Posada Trece, a subset of the Sureño gang.</p>
      <p>Fonseca allegedly committed two murders on behalf of the Boronda Boys Norteño subset, police said.</p>

        <b>The Paseo: </b>
        <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/06/kansas-city-paseo-street-martin-luther-king/2506399001/">Kansas City overwhelmingly votes to remove Martin Luther King's name from historic street</a>
      </p>
      <h3>How they escaped</h3>
      <p>They escaped the jail Sunday morning through a 22-by-8-inch hole they cut in the ceiling of a communal bathroom, Thornburg said. That hole was in a blind spot from jail cameras.</p>
      <p>After climbing into the hole, they made their way through an 11-inch gap between two interior walls with plumbing pipes. They kicked open a hatch, which was obscured by construction on the jail's renovation, and climbed over a construction fence, Thornburg said. </p>
      <h3>What the men are accused of</h3>
      <p>Salazar and a teenager were arrested last summer on suspicion that they fatally shot Jaime Ortiz Martinez, 20. </p>
      <p>When the shooting occurred, Martinez was in a vehicle with his girlfriend and their 18-month-old son, said Iwa Martinez, a relative speaking on behalf of the family in 2017.</p>
      <p>After the shooting, Martinez crashed into a parking barricade at the end of the street. The woman was shot in the cheek and taken to a hospital where she was treated and released. The child was uninjured.</p>
      <p>Fonseca faces two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, on June 2, 2018,  and Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, on June 5, 2018.</p>
      <p>He was 19 years old when police arrested him and his girlfriend Alexandra Romayor, 18.</p>
      <p>At the time of the first shooting, Acosta was in the driver's seat of a parked tan Nissan Maxima on a FaceTime video call with his wife in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Three days later, Cruz was in a parked car when he was approached by a gunman and fatally shot.</p>
      <p>Police said Romayor had the handgun used in both shootings in her purse. In June, she was sentenced to 15 years to life after pleading no contest to second-degree murder in Cruz's death and being an accessory to a gun charge in the shooting of Acosta.</p>
