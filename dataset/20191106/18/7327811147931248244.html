      <p>PORT WASHINGTON, Long Island (WABC) -- A drive turned into a dive on Long Island Wednesday morning and landed two men in the hospital.</p>
      <p>Authorities say the driver of an SUV lost control on Sunnyvale Road in Port Washington just before 10 a.m.</p>
      <p>He crashed into a fence, went airborne, and splashed down in the shallow end of a backyard pool covered with a tarp.</p>
      <p>"I was in my bedroom, and I heard this really bad crash," Carol Kronenberg said. "So from what I can understand, the SUV hit my fence, flew over this fence, and ended up in my neighbor's pool."</p>
      <p>Police helped the men out of the halfway-submerged vehicle, and they were taken to North Shore University Hospital for observation.</p>
      <p>Their injuries are not believed to be serious.</p>
      <p>The cause of the crash is under investigation.</p>
