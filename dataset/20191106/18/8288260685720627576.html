      <p>Gareth Barry missed the end of last season after undergoing surgery on his knee. His contract was up this past summer, but he has finally penned a new contract and can play for West Bromwich Albion after a financial issue with Everton was resolved.</p>
      <p>Albion and Everton had been locked in talks for several weeks over the final payment owed to the Merseyside club to extend Barry’s Hawthorns tenure into a third season. But a breakthrough in the impasse has enabled Barry, 38, to sign a new deal with the Baggies that will run until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>In terms of suspensions, Nathan Ferguson served the first of a three-match ban against Stoke - and he will also sit out the Hull and Sheffield Wednesday games.</p>
      <p>His return will be pencilled in for Bristol City at The Hawthorns at the end of next month.</p>
