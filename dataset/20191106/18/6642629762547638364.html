      <p>Armed attackers killed 10 people and kidnapped two others during a raid on a village in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/democratic-republic-congo.html"> </a>(<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/democratic-republic-congo.html">DRC</a>).</p>
      <p>Donat Kibwana, a local official, accused the fighters of belonging to a rebel group.</p>
      <p>Fighters stormed the village of Kokola in Beni territory on Monday evening, Kibwana said.</p>
      <p>The rebel group known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), originally from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/uganda.html">Uganda</a>, has been operating along the DRC-Uganda border for more than 20 years, one of a number of armed factions active in the DRC's east long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war.</p>
      <p>"The mode of the attack was the same as that of the ADF," Kibwana told Reuters news agency. </p>
      <p>The attack came five days after the DRC's army <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/dr-congo-launches-large-scale-operation-rebels-191101163242390.html">launched</a> a large-scale operation against rebel groups, primarily targeting ADF fighters, in an area which is also fighting to contain the second-worst <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/ebola.html">Ebola</a> epidemic on record.</p>
      <p>"While the army launched the large-scale operations deep into the forest, the rebels took the opportunity to attack the towns and civilians," Kibwana added. </p>
      <p>Several of ADF's previous attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) group, but the extent of their relationship remains unclear.</p>
      <p>The ADF is not known to have pledged loyalty to ISIL.</p>
      <h3>Soldiers killed in clashes</h3>
      <p>Six DRC soldiers were also killed in clashes around Kokola on Monday night, according to sources cited by the Kivu Security Tracker (KST), a website that monitors violence in the region.</p>
      <p>KST, which is a collaboration between New York University's Congo Research Group and New York-based Human Rights Watch (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/human-rights-watch.html">HRW</a>), said at least eight villagers were killed. The information could not be independently verified.</p>
      <p>The presence of the rebel group, along with a constellation of other fighters and armed criminal bands, has severely hampered efforts to contain the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/ebola.html">Ebola epidemic</a>, which has infected more than 3,000 people and killed about 2,000 since August last year.</p>
      <p>An estimated 160 rebel groups with a total of more than 20,000 fighters are still active in the DRC's east.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> has tried to stabilise the country for the past 20 years with a 15,000-strong peacekeeping force.</p>
