        <b>Mercedes' Trackside Engineering Director Andrew Shovlin says that he hopes the team has done former non-executive chairman Niki Lauda proud after winning a record six drivers' and constructors' titles in succession.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lauda passed away earlier this year with kidney problems after a spell of poor health, with an outpouring of emotion from the F1 world immediately after the news was announced.</p>

      <p>All at Mercedes say they miss the great Austrian, and Shovlin said after the United States Grand Prix: <i>“Today, we all think of Niki who was such an important part of our team. Losing him was quite a massive blow, particularly to Toto [Wolff] who spent so much of his working life with him, but for all of us as well, because Niki was someone with such a big personality, such a huge figure in our sport and such a friend to the team.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I think he would have appreciated this – doing it in such fine style this year, he would have seen this as a team at the top of its game. He’d probably be telling us to work on next years car now, but I think we’ve done him proud this season.”</i>
