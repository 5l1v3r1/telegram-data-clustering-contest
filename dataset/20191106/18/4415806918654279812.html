      <h1>Limerick FC deducted 26 points to finish bottom of First Division</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:02:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/stephen-barry/" target="_blank">By Stephen Barry</a></address>
      <p>Limerick FC have been deducted 26 points after the club entered examinership.</p>
      <p>The decision was made by the independent Club Licensing Committee for the SSE Airtricity League following the appointment of an examiner to Limerick FC by the High Court in September.</p>
      <p>Limerick finished 6th of ten clubs in the First Division this season but they will now move from 36 points to 10.</p>
      <p>That means Limerick will be deemed to have finished last, one point behind Wexford Youths in the table.</p>
      <p>A statement on behalf of the league read: "The SSE Airtricity League First Division table will be adjusted to reflect the Club Licensing Committee decision on Limerick FC.</p>
      <p>"Following the appointment of an Examiner by the High Court in September 2019, Limerick FC has been sanctioned by the independent Club Licensing Committee and deducted 26 points.</p>
      <p>"The club will be deemed to have finished 10th in the 2019 SSE Airtricity League First Division table."</p>
