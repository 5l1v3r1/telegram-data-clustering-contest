      <h2>The TOWIE stars have been on and off more times than a light switch, and now it's reported that they've reconciled once more after jetting off to Dubai to resolve their issues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:50:33+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gemma-collins">Gemma Collins</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-argent">James 'Arg' Argent</a> are reportedly back on yet again.</p>
      <p>The TOWIE stars have been on and off more than a light switch.</p>
      <p>And now it's said they're giving their romance another go after jetting off to Dubai together to sort out their differences.</p>
      <p>Just last month, Gemma, 38, was said to have dumped 31-year-old Arg when he refused to go to rehab.</p>
      <p>But less than three weeks later, it's reported they've been spotted kissing and holding hands during a romantic trip to Dubai.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7655059/Gemma-Collins-James-Argent-jetting-Dubai-resolve-issues.html">MailOnline</a> reports they were seen looking romantic at the £250-a-night Palazzo Versace Hotel.</p>
      <p>A source told them: "Gemma and Arg looked more loved up than ever in Dubai. They've been staying at the Versace hotel and have been working hard to talk through their problems.</p>

      <p>"At dinner they were holding hands and instead of arguing, they seemed relaxed and content in each other's company.</p>
      <p>"Everyone's hoping their time away together will do them the world of good and they can return a happy couple."</p>
      <p>They've split and got back together numerous times in the past.</p>
      <p>And the source says Gemma has got back with Arg "sooner than expected" this time, but that she loves and cares for him and can't ignore her feelings.</p>
      <p>Their most recent split came after Gemma called 999 over fears that James had overdosed.</p>

      <p>Speaking out about the incident recently, Arg told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/james-argent-overdose-gemma-collins-20730191">OK! magazine</a> : "Gemma loves me to death. She was seriously concerned because she couldn’t get hold of me, which I understand.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t have my phone on me because it was charging downstairs. I have put her through a lot so I completely understand her worry. She remembers what she’s been through in the past with me so she thought the worst."</p>
      <p>The couple once split because Gemma was left mortified by Arg sharing a video of her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/how-stop-snoring-7-tips-5561529">snoring</a> on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>They also had a huge argument where he took aim at her over her size.</p>
      <p>She was seen on her ITVBe show Diva Forever crying her eyes out as she turned to friends and family for support.</p>

      <p>Some told her she was better off without Arg.</p>
      <p>On the most recent episode of TOWIE, the GC was seen telling pals Bobby Norris and Chloe Sims that she's single.</p>
      <p>She said: "I held on for two years and stood by someone and unfortunately it has not worked out and it is very sad.</p>
      <p>"I haven’t stopped eating with the stress and upset of everything. What can you do?"</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Gemma and Arg's representatives for comment.</p>
