      <h1>Zahabi: Everybody knows what McGregor does; it would be ‘the Masvidal show’ after two rounds</h1>

      <p>Jorge Masvidal dominated Nate Diaz in their “BMF” title bout this weekend, leading to people talking about what’s next for the surging Cuban star. Conor McGregor threw his hat in the ring, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/3/20946617/jorge-masvidal-conor-mcgregor-i-would-f-ck-that-little-guy-up-ufc-news">asking for a “three piece and a soda,”</a> but Masvidal simply dismissed the “little dude’s” chances.</p>
      <p>Renowned MMA coach Firas Zahabi fielded similar questions on a recent Ask Me Anything session, where he initially complimented McGregor in a query about who might have the best hands in MMA.</p>
      <p>“I honestly would tell you that probably McGregor is the best puncher in the UFC,” Zahabi said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqFOYJnGe7Y">his YouTube channel</a>. “If I had to choose one guy off the top of my head, I would pick McGregor right now. However, there are guys out there who are very dangerous punchers, and I would say Jorge is among the elite.”</p>
      <p>Those kind words didn’t mean the Tristar Gym coach would pick McGregor if the pair fought though. Zahabi instead said he likes Masvidal’s chances, and thinks he can dominate in the later rounds.</p>
      <p>“I think (Masvidal) beats McGregor,” he said. “I think McGregor is a great fighter. I just think Masvidal is too big. He’s a great puncher and has a great chin. If he takes McGregor past the two rounds, it’s going to be the Masvidal show.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s very smart. He’s gonna do it,” he said. “I’m not saying McGregor has no chance of winning, but he’d have to win early and he’d have to connect with the left — and everybody kind of knows now what McGregor does. I think Masvidal’s gonna have a really good game plan, come really prepared, and he’s a lot bigger.</p>
      <p>“If McGregor had a hard time with Nate, he’s going to have a tremendously difficult time with Masvidal.”</p>
      <p>After sitting out 2018, Masvidal has had a breakthrough 2019, where he stopped talented contenders in Darren Till, Ben Askren and Nate Diaz. “Gamebred” has also recently been <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/5/20950743/ufc-jorge-masvidal-mayweather-mcgregor-canelo-boxers-cant-read-mma-fighters-well-boxing-news">calling out boxing superstar Canelo Alvarez</a>, who won a belt on the same night.</p>
