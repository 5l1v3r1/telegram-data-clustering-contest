      <p>The RS 660 is a middleweight supersport that weighs 169kg and produces 100hp.</p>
      <p>At EICMA 2019, the Piaggio group had models from its portfolio of brands – Aprilia, Moto Guzzi, Vespa and Piaggio – on display. However, the stars of the show were the two new mid-capacity motorcycles – the production-ready RS 660 supersport and the naked Tuono 660 concept, which will debut in 2021. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Aprilia RS 660</b>
      </p>
      <p>The RS 660 concept was first showcased at EICMA 2018, and it immediately became one of the most anticipated middleweight supersport bikes in the world. What a lot of us will be pleased with is the fact that the bike revealed yesterday looks nearly identical to the concept – the sharp bodywork and sporty stance remains nearly the same, with the only differences coming in the form of mandatory components like the extended rear fender.</p>
      <p>The RS 660 is powered by an all-new 660cc parallel-twin that produces 100hp. Torque figures haven’t been revealed, yet, but we do know that the bike will tip the scales at just 169kg, making for a rather impressive power-to-weight ratio. The rest of the bike has been developed from the ground up as well, with a new, lightweight aluminium frame and swingarm. </p>
      <p>The RS 660 also sports a comprehensive package that’s derived from the one on the flagship RSV4. It includes a five-mode traction control system that’s assisted by a six-axis IMU, Aprilia Traction Control, Aprilia Wheelie Control, a quickshifter, engine brake control, and five self-explanatory riding modes – Commute, Individual, Dynamic, Challenge, and Time Attack. The electronics also include cruise control. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Aprilia Tuono 660 Concept</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aprilia also gave us something to look forward to at next year’s show with the Tuono 660, which is essentially a naked RS 660. It will use the same 660cc parallel-twin, but will produce a tad less power, at 95hp. We could also see a difference in the way this power is delivered, considering it isn’t as track-oriented as the RS 660. The chassis and hardware will be borrowed from the RS 660 as well.</p>
      <p>The RS 660 should go on sale soon; prices for it haven’t been disclosed yet. Will the middleweight supersport make its way to India? There’s no need of it yet, but it's certainly a bike that enthusiasts here will appreciate.</p>
