      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): Green Packet Bhd saw 131.66 million shares, which represents 14.23% of the company's total 925.4 million shares, cross off-market today.</p>
      <p>According to Bloomberg data, the shares were transacted in five blocks for a total of RM95.52 million.</p>
      <p>The transactions were carried out at between 72.5 sen (discount of 0.68%) and 75 sen (premium of 2.74%) a share.</p>
      <p>It is not immediately known as to whom the parties involved in the transactions are.</p>
      <p>The transactions came after some 35 million or 3.79% of Green Packet shares crossed off-market on Monday (Nov 4), at 75 sen a piece.</p>
      <p>On Friday (Nov 1), Green Packet announced it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with China Mobile Group Device Co Ltd to mutually explore opportunities in promoting and distributing each other’s products and services.</p>
      <p>The Chinese firm is a subsidiary of state-owned China Mobile Communications Group Co Ltd, whose other subsidiaries include China’s largest telecommunications company, China Mobile Ltd.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that on Sept 27, Singapore-based private equity firm Kendall Court's wholly-owned Summit Synergy Ltd emerged as a substantial shareholder of Green Packet with a 7.19% equity stake, after having acquired 65 million shares at 70 sen per share.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, The Edge Financial Daily wrote on Sept 19, citing sources familiar with the matter, that a foreign institutional investor from China is expected to emerge as a substantial shareholder of Green Packet, after more than 10% of the company's shares crossed off-market in the week before that.</p>
      <p>Green Packet shares closed half a sen higher or 0.69% at 73 sen today, valuing the company at RM675.54 million. Some 2.19 million shares were traded. Year-to-date, the counter has more than doubled from when it was trading at 31 sen.</p>
