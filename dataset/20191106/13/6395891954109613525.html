      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - German authorities say a 43-year-old Dutch man living in a border town was shot and seriously wounded in what is believed to have been a targeted attack on him.</p>
      <p>Muenster prosecutor Martin Botzenhardt, whose office is handling the investigation, told The Associated Press the victim was struck in a hail of bullets Wednesday morning in Gronau, fired from a white vehicle with Netherlands license plates.</p>
      <p>He wouldn't comment on Dutch media reports that the victim was a lawyer, but said "there are indications the Gronau man was targeted."</p>
      <p>Police were still searching for the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Botzenhardt said the victim, whose name hasn't been released, is currently being treated in a hospital. He had no information on his condition, but said he was able to talk to authorities after the attack.</p>
