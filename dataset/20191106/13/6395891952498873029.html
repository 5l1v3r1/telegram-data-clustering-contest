      <p><b>ZAGREB, CroatiaÂ (AP)</b> - More than 2,000 teachers and other employees in Croatia's education system have rallied in the capital of Zagreb to press for higher wages after being on strike for nearly a month.</p>
      <p>Carrying banners and blowing whistles, the protesters marched Wednesday through the city before gathering outside government headquarters in Zagreb.</p>
      <p>The unions are demanding wage hikes but talks with the government so far have yielded no results.</p>
      <p>Sanja Sprem of the Croatian teacher's union says "it's important to show the government that teachers are ready to fight for their dignity."</p>
      <p>The teachers' strike started last month, with different Croatian municipalities halting classes on different days. There are about 1,000 schools in Croatia with tens of thousands of employees.</p>
