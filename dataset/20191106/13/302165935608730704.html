      <p>ATHENS, Nov 6 — Cyprus today said it had started a process to strip 26 individuals of citizenship they received under a secretive passports for investment scheme.</p>
      <p>“Cabinet has decided to initiate a process to revoke Cypriot citizenship from 26 individuals,” Interior Minister Constantinos Petrides said.</p>
      <p>“The Council of Ministers today affirmed the will of the government for strict adherence to the terms and conditions of the Cyprus investment programme,” he added.</p>
      <p>Petrides did not disclose the nationalities or identities of the individuals concerned, but a Reuters investigation last month revealed wealthy relatives and allies of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen had received Cypriot passports under the scheme.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen has previously denied opposition allegations that members of his inner circle had passports from other countries and lived the high life overseas. — Reuters</p>
