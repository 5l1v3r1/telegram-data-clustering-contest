      <p>Cape Town - Catherine, The Duchess of Cambridge, is just like you and me. Sometimes she just wants to have a good time at the pub with her friends.</p>
      <p>Kate joined her fellow school-mums for a drink at a pub in Chelsea last month, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/mailonsunday/index.html"><b>The Mail on Sunday.</b></a></p>
      <p>How did she do it? Well, according to the publication, the 37-year-old, slipped into the Hollywood Arms via a secret entrance in a rear alleyway that her brother-in-law Prince Harry reportedly used to use.</p>
      <p>Kate went to a 'meet and greet' drinks party, held each year for parents of new pupils at Thomas's school in Battersea.</p>
      <p>Princess Charlotte started at the school - <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/everything-we-know-about-prince-george-and-princess-charlottes-r363k-a-year-school-the-prestigious-thomass-battersea-20190828"><b>which her brother George attends</b></a> - in September.</p>
