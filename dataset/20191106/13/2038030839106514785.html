      <p>Cape Town - Demi Moore has opened up about her marriage to Ashton Kutcher.</p>
      <p>The Rough Night actress and her daughters Tallulah and Rumer Willis spoke to Jada Pinkett Smith on her Facebook show, <i>Red Table Talk</i>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7649295/Demi-Moore-says-addiction-Ashton-Kutcher-devastating-Rumer-Willis-stand-it.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>During the episode, the 56-year-old opened up about her eight-year marriage to ex-husband Ashton Kutcher, who’s 15 years her junior.</p>
      <p>"The addiction and the codependency . . . like my addiction to Ashton – that was probably almost more devastating because it took me seriously away emotionally," Demi said.</p>
      <p>Her 25-year-old daughter, Tallulah, went on to reveal the impact her mom's drug and alcohol addiction had on her, <a href="https://people.com/movies/demi-moore-addiction-ashton-kutcher-was-devastating/"><b>People</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"Watching the behaviour with Ashton, those years, because everyone had left the house and it was just me living there, I felt very forgotten and I feel like I developed and nurtured a narrative where she didn’t love me and I truly believed it," Tallulah said.</p>
      <p>"I know that she does, 100 percent, but in that moment you’re hurt."</p>
      <p>Demi also went on to explain how she relapsed while on a trip with Ashton in 2014.</p>
      <p>"Ashton said, ‘I don’t know if alcoholism’s a thing. I think it’s about moderation’," Demi said.</p>
      <p>"If I’d stayed close to working my programme . . . I, of course, lived the majority of my adult life sober. I was great sober."</p>
      <p>Actress and singer Rumer (31) revealed that she didn’t like her mom and Ashton’s relationship, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/demi-moore-rumer-willis-couldnt-stand-relationship-ashton-kutcher"><b>Fox News</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"So much of that time, especially with Ashton, I was so angry because I felt like something that was mine had been taken away," Rumer said.</p>
      <p>"I think also when she wanted to have another baby and then it wasn’t happening, and there was so much focus on that, it was like ‘Oh, well, we’re not enough’."</p>
      <p>Demi and Ashton tied the knot in 2005 but decided to call it quits in 2011 and were officially divorced in 2013.</p>
