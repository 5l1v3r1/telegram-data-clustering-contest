      <p>Racist Vicki Momberg has been arrested and processed at the Douglasdale Police Station where she handed herself in on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters confirmed to News24 that the k-word ranter would be handed over to the prosecuting authorities at the Randburg Magistrate's Court.</p>
      <p>This comes after she was on the run following a warrant of arrest that was issued due to her failure to appear before the Randburg court in August after unsuccessfully appealing against her crimen injuria conviction, <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-11-03-racist-vicki-momberg-on-the-run-say-police/">Sunday Times</a> reported.</p>

      <p>The former real estate agent was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria after she called a black police officer the k-word 48 times when he came to her aid, following a smash-and-grab incident in 2016, News24 reported.</p>
      <p>The k-word rant was captured in a video which went viral.</p>
      <p>Momberg was later sentenced to two years in jail, with an additional one year suspended in March 2018.<br/><br/>She was then granted bail, pending the outcome of her appeal against her conviction and sentence which was subsequently dismissed, News24 reported.</p>
