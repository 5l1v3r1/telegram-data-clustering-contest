      <h2>It's almost time to start ripping open the Christmas advent calendar, and so Tesco has just launched half price discounts on Mars and Cadbury chocolate advent calendars</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:01:20+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>As much as we want an advent calendar filled full of booze and luxury beauty products, sometimes there's no beating a classic <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chocolate">chocolate</a> number.</p>
      <p>And now it's November, it's perfectly fine to start stocking up - especially considering that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tesco">Tesco</a> has just slashed the price of some of their most popular chocolate-filled offerings to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fgroceries%2Fen-GB%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3Dadvent%2520calendar%26viewAll%3Dpromotion%26promotion%3Doffers%26sortBy%3DpriceAscending&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Ftesco-slashes-price-cadbury-mars-20823069">just £1.</a></p>
      <p>All the classics from Cadbury and Mars are included, such as Maltesers, Dairy Milk, Galaxy and Mars bar, which are all now 50% off their usual £2 price tag if you're shopping at Tesco.</p>
      <p>Available both in store and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fgroceries%2Fen-GB%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3Dadvent%2520calendar%26viewAll%3Dpromotion%26promotion%3Doffers%26sortBy%3DpriceAscending&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Ftesco-slashes-price-cadbury-mars-20823069">online</a>, the offer will last up until Tuesday 12th November if you're ordering from the website, meaning it's likely to be available up until Monday 11th in stores.</p>

      <p>The most expensive place to pick up a Dairy Milk advent calendar is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrose.com%2Fecom%2Fproducts%2Fcadbury-dairy-milk-chocolate-advent-calendar%2F063267-32131-32132&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Ftesco-slashes-price-cadbury-mars-20823069">Waitrose,</a> where it costs a hefty <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrose.com%2Fecom%2Fproducts%2Fcadbury-dairy-milk-chocolate-advent-calendar%2F063267-32131-32132&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Ftesco-slashes-price-cadbury-mars-20823069">£2.19</a>.</p>
