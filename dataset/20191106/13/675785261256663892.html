      <h2>Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood reckons the current Leicester City boss could turn thing around at Arsenal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:48:44+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers is the "obvious" candidate to replace Unai Emery at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>That's according to former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> manager Tim Sherwood, who says if he was in charge at Arsenal he'd "certainly by trying to tap him up".</p>
      <p>The Gunners have struggled under Emery this season and have won just two of their past nine fixtures in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Fans have started to get on the Spaniard's back and a number of managers have been linked with Emery's job in recent weeks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester City</a> meanwhile are punching well above their weight under Rodgers.</p>
      <p>The northern Irishman has guided the Foxes to third in the Premier League, and Sherwood reckons Rodgers could do the same at Arsenal.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Premier League Productions, Sherwood said: "They [Arsena] might not have to go far to negotiate with another manager because he might be sitting right next to him [at the weekend].</p>
      <p>"I think Brendan Rodgers is an obvious choice for a top, top Premier League team. Would he want to leave <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> ? I'm not saying he would.</p>
      <p>"But if I was at the head of it at Arsenal, I like Brendan Rodgers, I think he's a better manager than Unai Emery. I would certainly be trying to tap him up."</p>
