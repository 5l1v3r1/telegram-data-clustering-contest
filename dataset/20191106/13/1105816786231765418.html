      <h1>Pakistan welcomes Saudi Arabia-brokered peace deal in Yemen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:17:22+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan has welcomed the conclusion of the landmark “Riyadh agreement”, as a result of the initiative taken by the Saudi Arabia leadership and supported by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government.</p>
      <p>“We believe it is a crucial and important step forward towards a political solution and durable peace and security in Yemen,” Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a tweet on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia brokered a power sharing agreement between Yemen’s internationally recognised government and southern separatists, which observers say could pave the way for a wider peace deal.</p>
      <p>The development came after the rebel missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities spiked over the summer, followed by a lull in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from the Houthi rebels, who seized the capital Sanaa and much of northern Yemen in 2014, sparking a Saudi-led military intervention the following March.</p>

      <p>Washington too is in talks with the Houthis, Assistant Secretary of Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker said during a visit to Saudi Arabia in September.</p>
      <p>He did not say whether the Americans were holding talks separately with the rebels, but analysts say they were likely happening in consultation with Saudi Arabia, a key ally of Washington.</p>
      <p>The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 as the rebels closed in on second city Aden, prompting President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi to flee into Saudi exile.</p>
      <p>Riyadh had reportedly hoped for a quick win against the Houthis, but instead waded into a quagmire that has cost it billions of dollars and hurt its reputation, while devastating the Arab world’s poorest country.</p>
      <p>The “Riyadh agreement”, hailed as a stepping stone towards ending the wider conflict, would see the government return to Aden and place armed forces from both sides under the authority of the defence and interior ministries.</p>
