      <h1>After Brief Ban, Krispy Kreme Will Allow Minnesota Student to Resell Doughnuts After All</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:44:08+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(ST. PAUL, Minn.) — Krispy Kreme has reached an agreement with a Minnesota college student who drove to Iowa every weekend to buy hundreds of doughnuts to resell them in the Twin Cities area.</p>
      <p>The company said in a statement that Jayson Gonzalez of Champlin can now work with Krispy Kreme as an independent operator. The deal also includes a 500-dozen doughnut donation when he starts up again.</p>
      <p>The <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i> <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/11/04/krispy-kreme-relents-the-donut-guy-is-back-in-business/">reports</a> the 21-year-old Gonzalez also announced the deal on his Facebook page, adding that he’s “pumped” to continue his business.</p>
      <p>Last week, Krispy Kreme told Gonzalez to stop the resell venture because it created a liability for the company. The confectionary giant said in a statement Monday that the “temporary stoppage” was to ensure product quality and regulatory compliance.</p>
