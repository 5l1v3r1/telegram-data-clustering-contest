      <h1>Apple iPad market share grows by 4% in third quarter, stronger mix of iPad Pro sales</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:35:07+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benjaminmayo/" target="_blank">Benjamin Mayo</a></address>
      <p>This week, Strategy Analytics <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191105005221/en/Strategy-Analytics-Prime-Day-Alexa-Catapult-Amazon">released its latest tablet industry</a> report detailing market share across all global manufacturers.</p>
      <p>According to the estimates, Apple’s iPad continues to be strong. Market share grew by 4% in Q3 2019 compared to the same period last year, or about 10.1 million shipments. Overall tablet sales fell by 4% with only Apple, Amazon, and Lenovo showing increased sales.</p>
      <p>In September, Apple launched the new cheaper iPad, offering a 10.2-inch screen and Smart Keyboard support for $329.</p>
      <p>Whilst this launch no doubt helped with sales, Strategy Analytics notes that overall Apple revenue from iPad grew 8% in this quarter, as reported in the company’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/30/aapl-earnings-q4-2019/">quarterly financial earnings</a>.</p>
      <p>If Apple’s units only rose 4% but its total revenue grew 8%, this means Apple is seeing a higher mix of the more expensive iPad Pro models.</p>

      <p>This is impressive as the redesigned iPad Pro lineup is almost a year old at this point and Apple did not update the model in 2019. The upcoming iPad Pro with a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/17/2019-ipad-pro/">new rear 3D sensing camera</a> is currently expected to launch <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/21/apple-ar-headset/">in early 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>The iPad continues to dominate the iPad market with 10.1 million shipments in the July-September period. The next biggest manufacturer was apparently Amazon with 5.3 million shipments, fuelled by heavy Prime Day discounts. Overall tablet sales topped 38 million units, a decline of 4%. Apple managed to increase iPad units despite a wider contracting market.</p>
