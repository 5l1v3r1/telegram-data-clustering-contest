      <p>If you've been eager to cast your eyes on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/07/tesla-pickup-truck-unveil-november/">Tesla's pickup truck,</a> you won't have to wait too much longer. CEO Elon Musk says the automaker will reveal its Cybertruck at a Los Angeles event November 21st.</p>

      <p>Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/11/tesla-annual-shareholders-meeting-2019/">talked up the truck</a> at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting in June. He suggested that Ford's F-150, which Musk called a "great truck," is a bit of a benchmark for Tesla's own vehicle (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/23/electric-ford-f-150-tow-over-a-million-pounds/">Ford's working on an electric version of that, too</a>).</p>
      <p>The Cybertruck has been crafted to "meet or exceed an F-150. If the F-150 can do it then a Tesla truck should be able to do it." Musk suggested it has a bold "cyberpunk" design, "like it came out of a sci-fi movie." It seems the rest of us will get to determine whether that's accurate in a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>Musk also noted the reveal date is "strangely familiar." The classic cyberpunk movie <i>Blade Runner</i> is set in Los Angeles in November 2019, after all.</p>
