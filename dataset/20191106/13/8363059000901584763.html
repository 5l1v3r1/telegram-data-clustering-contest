      <h1>Alt-Fuel Electric Cars Were Genuinely Popular in October Sales Data</h1>

      <p>The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has reported new car sales numbers for October, and the numbers are pretty grim across the board for all but the electric segment of the market; which it would seem is finally seeing sales numbers that approximate the electric powertrain hype.</p>
      <p>Total car sales for October were 6.7 per cent lower than in the same month of 2018, reflecting "political uncertainty" and the lack of confidence of punters when it comes to imagining how they're going to pay off their lovely new car leases when/if the country self-immolates in the near future.</p>
      <p>But for cars that are "alternatively fuelled" – which means battery-only vehicles and the strange world of the, ahem, self-charging hybrid – the news is great for once, with sales of full or part electric models now accounting for 9.9 per cent of the entire market. And the majority of that growth has come courtesy of the full electric sector too, which recorded a staggering 151.8 per cent year-on-year growth, as EVs continue to benefit from the arrival of Tesla's Model 3 and rafts of new Hyundai and Kia models arriving with larger ranges, bigger batteries and lower prices.
