      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Dane Eagle announced Wednesday his intention to run for Congress to fill the seat of Francis Rooney, who is not running for re-election for District 19 in 2020.</p>
      <p>"I am running for Congress because the future of our nation is at stake, and I will not sit on the sidelines while our country, our Constitution, and our President are under attack," writes the Cape Coral native, who has represented Florida's 77th District since 2012.</p>
      <p>Republican Francis Rooney announced last month that he has decided to not run for re-election, just days after suggesting he may be open to impeaching President Trump. He said he initially thought his goals would take three terms, but he believes he's met them in less than two.</p>
      <p>District 19 includes coastal sections of Lee and Collier counties.</p>
      <p>"I'm running for Congress to preserve our Constitution, secure our borders, defend the 2nd Amendment, clean up our waterways, and protect American jobs," writes Eagle. "And yes, I will stand with President Trump in his fight to Keep America Great."</p>
