      <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A new proposal in Florida <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/state/bill-would-require-florida-couples-to-read-marriage-guide-before-tying-the-knot?aaaa">would require couples</a> to read a marriage guide before tying the knot.</p>
      <p>State Sen. Dennis Baxley, a Republican whose district covers Central Florida, filed S.B. 682 on Oct. 28 "to combat the rising cost of divorce to Florida’s citizens."</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2020/682/BillText/Filed/PDF">READ THE BILL HERE</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The bill would create a Marriage Education Committee within the Department of Children and Families.</p>
      <p>That committee would then publish the "Florida Guide to a Healthy Marriage," a book covering important marriage topics like communication skills, parenting, conflict management, financial issues, and domestic violence.</p>
      <p>Couples who want to get married would be required to read the guide, or some other presentation that contains similar information, before a judge or clerk of court could issue them a marriage license.</p>
      <p>Under the bill, couples would have to sign an affidavit under oath saying they've read it.</p>
      <p>"The facts are mounting and the high cost of divorce impacting Florida’s Families in human and public costs must be addressed," said State Sen. Baxley in a statement. "This marriage handbook can help Florida Families build healthy families, giving them a guide to build a strong foundation."</p>
      <p>The "Florida Guide to a Healthy Marriage" would complement the current "Florida Family Law Handbook." State law requires couples to read that handbook or other marriage-related information before receiving a marriage license.</p>
      <p>The Marriage Education Committee would consist of six marriage education and family advocates, and the "Florida Guide to a Healthy Marriage" would be paid for through funding from private sources, not taxpayer money.</p>
      <p>The funds would cover the costs of the design and layout, as well as printing and distributing copies.</p>
      <p>If passed by the Florida Legislature, the law would go into effect on July 1, 2020.</p>
