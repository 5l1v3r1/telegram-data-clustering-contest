      <p>“Around noon, a man attacked tourists, a tour guide and a security officer who tried to stop him in Jerash”, a popular attraction 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the capital Amman, a spokesman for the public security directorate said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The wounded were transported to the hospital for treatment” and “the assailant was immediately arrested”, he added.</p>
      <p>He did not specify the nationality of the attacker or of those wounded, nor give details on the severity of their injuries.</p>

      <p>It is not the first time tourist sites have been targeted by attacks in FMusJordan.</p>
      <p>In December 2016, at Karak, home to one of the region’s biggest Crusader castles, 10 people were killed in an attack that also left 30 wounded.</p>
      <p>The attack was claimed by the militant Islamic State group (IS). Ten people were ultimately sentenced for carrying out the attack.</p>
      <p>The Roman ruins at Jerash are one of Jordan’s main tourist draws after the ancient desert city of Petra.</p>
      <p>Tourism is a mainstay of the Jordanian economy.</p>
