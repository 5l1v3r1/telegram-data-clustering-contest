      <h1>EICMA 2019: 2020 Kawasaki Z900 showcased</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:00:07+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aditya Jadhav  </a></address>
      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/kawasaki/z900-m669/">Kawasaki Z900</a> has been updated to the 2020 iteration and has been showcased at the ongoing EICMA 2019. The naked motorcycle now sports tweaked styling and updated electronic suit.</p>
      <p>The new motorcycle now sports an angrier fascia which is in line with the Sumogi design philosophy that we recently saw on the Kawasaki Z H2 - showcased at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019. The headlamp assembly is all LED and gets fangs like LEDs on the sides as a part of the design. The motorcycle also gets four new colour schemes to chose from - black, grey, metallic black with lime green, black with pearl white, and a combination of two shades of black.</p>

      <p>Along with the styling upgrade, the dashboard gets a new 4.3-inch TFT screen for instrumentation. The new screen features smartphone connectivity via 'RIDEOLOGYTHE APP'. The application logs the riding data that the user/rider can access post-ride.</p>

      <p>Mechanically the motorcycle stays the same but the 948cc, inline-four engine is now Euro 5 compliant. The power is rated at 124PS at 9,500rpm and 98.6Nm at 7,700rpm. The motorcycles trellis frame has undergone tweaks, so has the suspension setup. 2020 Z900 uses upside-down forks in the front and the rear gets a horizontally mounted mono-shock absorber.</p>

      <p>Currently, the Z900 on sale in India features only ABS (Antilock Braking System). On the flip side, the 2020 Z900 hosts a bunch load of electronic aids such as three-level of traction control, and two riding modes - Low and Full. On 'Low' riding mode the power is limited to 55 per cent.</p>

      <p>Other cycle parts include twin 300mm disc set up in the front and a 250mm disc setup in the rear. The motorcycle now uses Dunlop Sportmax Roadsport 2 tires.</p>
