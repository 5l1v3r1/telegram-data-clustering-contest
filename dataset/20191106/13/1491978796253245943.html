      <p><b>Name: </b>Reverse nepotism.</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> Very recent.</p>
      <p><b>Any chance you could define it for me? </b>Well, if nepotism is winning power or influence because of proximity to someone who is powerful or influential, the reverse must be being damaged by such an association.</p>
      <p><b>Are you thinking of anyone in particular?</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/samantha-cameron">Samantha Cameron</a>, the unfortunate wife of that chap who was prime minister several aeons ago and let loose the chaos now consuming the UK.</p>
      <p><b>What is her problem? I thought they were now living happily in a shed in the Cotswolds. </b>He rarely ventures out of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/30/downing-street-to-garden-retreat-david-cameron-spends-25000-on-luxury-hut">designer shed</a>, but she is a successful entrepreneur with her own fashion business.</p>
      <p><b>That is news to me.</b> You need to start reading the fashion pages. In 2017, SamCam launched <a href="https://www.cefinn.com/pages/about-us">Cefinn</a>, “a London-based label creating chic, grownup fashion for the multitasking urban woman”.</p>
      <p><b>Sounds lovely.</b> Indeed it is. “Easy to wear and elegantly understated, it’s fashion you don’t have to overthink.”</p>
      <p><b>Describes me to a T. So what is her problem?</b> The bloke in the shed.</p>
      <p><b>Dave?</b> Yes. “There are some people who don’t shop with us because of who my husband is,” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/business/samantha-cameron-suggests-david-camerons-political-career-has/">she told</a> the Women Mean Business Live conference this week, admitting that Cameron’s rock-bottom political reputation was affecting sales.</p>
      <p><b>Oh, what a shame.</b> I sense you don’t really mean that.</p>
      <p><b>You sense right.</b> <b>Odd name, Cefinn.</b> It’s pronounced “Sefin” to rhyme with “Elfin”, and is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/nov/30/sam-cam-the-brand-what-to-expect-from-the-cefinn-fashion-label">an acronym</a> derived from the first and last letters of her surname, plus her children’s initials: Elwen, Florence, Ivan and Nancy.</p>
      <p><b>Seems rather solipsistic. </b>I think it is sweet.</p>
      <p><b>Is reverse nepotism a problem generally?</b> It seems to be in the fashion industry. No one took Victoria Beckham seriously when she started out as a designer because she was a Spice Girl who had married a famous footballer.</p>
      <p><b>How about Stella McCartney? </b>Never had a problem with reverse nepotism – ex-Beatles are sacrosanct – although her success has <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1296128/JAN-MOIR-Are-McCartneys-irritating-family-Britain.html">occasionally</a> (and very unfairly) been attributed to her dad Paul.</p>
      <p><b>Do say:</b> “Isn’t SamCam best known for luxury accessories?”</p>
      <p><b>Don’t say:</b> “That’s no way to refer to our former prime minister.”</p>
