      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/son-heung-min">Son Heung-min</a> has admitted that he still feels “really, really sorry” for his involvement in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/andre-gomes">Andre Gomes</a>’ horrific ankle injury last weekend, after the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> forward scored twice in his side’s crucial 4-0 victory over <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/red-star-belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Champions-League">Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>Son bounced back from his weekend devastation as he scored two goals in <b><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/red-star-belgrade-vs-tottenham-result-champions-league-goals-lo-celso-son-eriksen-a9188546.html">Tottenham’s impressive 4-0 Champions League win at Red Star Belgrade</a></b>.</p>
      <p>He was visibly distraught after his tackle led to a horrific injury to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Everton">Everton</a> midfielder on Sunday and he was a doubt to make the trip to Serbia as a result.</p>
      <p>But he put it all behind him in Belgrade with a double in four second-half minutes to take his tally to nine Champions League goals in 2019 and five in four games this season.</p>
      <p>And goalscorer Son admitted it had been a tough week following his involvement in the incident that saw Everton midfielder Andre Gomes suffer a horrific injury on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He told BT Sport 2: “It was a really, really tough few days. I realised how lucky I am to have the supporters, my friends, my team-mates – everyone gave me such strong messages.</p>
      <p>“Of course I still feel really, really sorry about this accident and this situation.</p>
      <p>“I had to focus for the team. I had to keep going. I had to keep working hard. I think this is my right answer to all the people who support me.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham’s victory means a win over Greek outfit Olympiacos in their next Champions League match will seal their progression to the knockout stages for a third consecutive season.</p>
