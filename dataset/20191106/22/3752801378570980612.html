      <p>The government welcomed the four life sentences imposed on the 44-year-old Durban father who killed his four children.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg handed Sibusiso Mpungose four life terms for killing his children, News24's sister publication, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-durban-dad-sibusiso-mpungose-handed-4-life-terms-for-killing-his-children-20191106">The Witness</a> reported.</p>
      <p>This after he pleaded guilty to hanging Kuhlekonke, 4, Khwezi, 6, Siphesihle, 10, and stepdaughter Ayakha Jiyane, 17.</p>
      <p>Government spokesperson Phumla Williams said Mpungose's sentence should serve as a warning that crime against children and women would not be tolerated.</p>
      <p>"The government will continue to strengthen its instruments that seek to ensure the safety of its citizens, especially the vulnerable. Access to justice for victims of gender-based violence is one of the priorities of the government.</p>
      <p>"South Africans are encouraged to be responsible and speak out if they suspect a child is being abused. All members of the public must do more to protect children as they are the future of South Africa," Williams added.</p>
      <p>Mpungose said in his plea he had killed his children on September 3 in Wyebank, Pinetown, because he believed his wife was having an affair.</p>
      <p>He is set to return to court later this month to face a charge of rape.</p>
