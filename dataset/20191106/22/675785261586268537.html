      <h1>Sadio Mane hits back at Pep Guardiola over "diving" claims ahead of Liverpool vs Man City</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool forward Mane insists he is not a diver and laughed off the comments by Guardiola ahead of Man City's trip to Anfield on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:30:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Sadio Mane has claimed Pep Guardiola has tried to 'get the attention of the referee' by branding the forward a 'diver' prior to Liverpool's clash against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Guardiola made the comments after Mane was booked for simulation in Liverpool's last-gasp victory over Aston Villa, in which the Senegalese headed the winner.</p>
      <p>Mane has already won penalties against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> this season and Guardiola claimed the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> man 'sometimes dives'.</p>
      <p>But Mane laughed off the comments when pressed ahead of Sunday's clash, insisting he will not change the way he plays.</p>
      <p>“If it could be a penalty for sure I will ‘dive’ again,” he joked. “If the dive will give me a penalty then I will do it to get it back. Why not?</p>

      <p>“But what Jurgen said is correct. I do not dive.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit clever from him to get the attention of the referee but I will just play my football,” he said. “I don’t pay attention to what he’s saying because it’s part of football.</p>
      <p>“Even though I saw him commenting about it, what he said, for me, I think it’s positive.</p>
      <p>“The only thing I can say I will be ready for the team, to give everything possible, and to help my team.”</p>

      <p>Mane was pressed on his booking against Villa after the referee adjudged he went down too easily under the challenge of Frederic Guilbert.</p>
      <p>“There was contact for sure,” he said. “Maybe it was not a penalty and he didn’t give it, and he gave me a yellow card. I don’t have any problem about it.</p>
      <p>“It can happen in football and we have seen many ­people, some diving and get penalties, some got a ­penalty and the referee didn’t give it. You have to deal with it.</p>
      <p>“If I get a penalty, yeah it’s a penalty. If no penalty, no penalty, but it will never change the way I’m playing or the way I’m doing my things.”</p>
      <p>Mane is under no illusions how big Sunday's game is - with the Reds having an opportunity to open up a nine-point ap at the top with victory.</p>
      <p>He added: “It will be really really important for us to get a positive result and we will be ready, spot on from the first second until the last.</p>
      <p>“We will give everything possible to win.”</p>
