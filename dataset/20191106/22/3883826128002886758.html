        <b>United States striker Alex Morgan says she wants to play at the Olympics - three months after she is due to give birth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Morgan, 30, finished joint-top scorer at the 2019 Women's World Cup and is viewed as one of the world's best female players.</p>
      <p>Her first child is due in April 2020, three months before USA are scheduled to play at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>"It's my goal to play there," Morgan said.</p>
      <p>"It's clearly a short window but if I'm able to, I want to be there representing my country."</p>
      <p>Morgan and her husband, LA Galaxy footballer Servando Carrasco, announced last month that they were expecting a daughter.</p>
      <p>Morgan, who plays for Orlando Pride, has scored 107 times for her country in 169 appearances and won the Women's World Cup in 2015 and 2019.</p>
      <p>She was named in the FIFPro World XI in 2016, 2017 and 2019, and also won the Women's Champions League while on loan with Lyon in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Olympic Games officially begin on 24 July, though the football competition starts two days earlier.</p>
