      <p>As his father’s obsession with learning the identity of the whistleblower who’s complaint prompted the impeachment inquiry <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-whistleblower-reporters-identity">intensifies</a>, Donald Trump Jr. promoted an attempt to name the government official.</p>
      <p>Democrats and <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/why-still-calling-whistleblower-identity">some Republicans</a> have called for the whistleblower to remain anonymous, noting that the law protects whistleblowers and arguing that outing the whistleblower would endanger him.</p>
      <p>Yet, some of Trump’s closest allies have called for the whistleblower to be exposed. And Breitbart on Wednesday published a piece noting that RealClearPolitics reported on the alleged identity individual, citing anonymous officials, and linked this official to Obama adminstration officials. Trump Jr. then tweeted out Breitbart’s story.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower’s lawyers, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, responded Wednesday with a <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/whistleblower-lawyers-identity-trump-supporters">statement</a> asserting that they “will not confirm or deny any name that is published or promoted by supporters of the President.”</p>
      <p>The lawyers jabbed at Trump allies’ attempts to expose their client, saying that such efforts are driven by a “desperation to deflect from the substance of the whistleblower complaint.”</p>
      <p>“It will not relieve the President of the need to address the substantive allegations, all of which have been substantially proven to be true,” Bakaj and Zaid said.</p>
      <p>The White House told <a href="https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1192101275753701377">HuffPost reporter Yashar Ali</a> Trump did not know in advance that his son would tweet the article, nor did any senior administration officials.</p>
