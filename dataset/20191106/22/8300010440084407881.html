      <p>Vanessa Ferree's 28-year-old daughter Casie tragically passed away in September.<br/><br/>"She was the most bravest, courageous, sweet angel," Ferree said.<br/><br/>Casie battled to stay alive after suffering a horrible car accident due to a drunk driver. The accident left her paralyzed.<br/><br/>Vanessa put everything on hold, dedicating herself to give her daughter around-the-clock care, until she passed away.<br/><br/>"Where we are sitting here right now, was a hospital bed and Casie was pretty much just living in this hospital bed with Vanessa taking care of her," described Anna Guilford, a close family friend.<br/><br/>Guilford was so touched by Ferree's dedication, she wanted to pay it forward.<br/><br/>"I nominated Vanessa because she literally put her life on hold for her daughter Casie," Guilford said.<br/><br/>"I just blown out of the water that anybody even thought...I didn't even think anybody could have thought that of me," Ferree said.<br/><br/>With all the tragedy she's endured, having the support of a friend like Guilford brings a little light into her life.<br/><br/>Ferree says the world was robbed of her daughter's smile and loving energy - but keeps memories of her all around.<br/><br/>"I really wish y'all could have met her," she said.<br/><br/>Ferree is one of three "Pay It Forward" finalists announced this week leading up to Friday's big reveal. That's when the grand prize winner of $10,000 from Mathis Brothers will be announced.</p>
