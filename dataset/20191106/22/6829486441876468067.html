      <p>‘Clarity’ hitmaker Zedd and DJ Snake have been locked in to headline the second ever edition of Ultra Australia next March.</p>
      <p>The dance festival juggernaut officially landed in the country last year, after a Road to Ultra event the year before. By the looks of it, it’s here to stay: the 2020 bill will also feature Dutch producer Afrojack, along with Jeffrey Sutorius, who’s coming with his new solo project The Return Of Dash Berlin.</p>
      <p>Eric Prydz will appear on the main stage, while his techno alias Cirez D will headline the Resistance Stage. He’ll be joined there by Italian tech powerhouse Deborah de Luca, Eats Everything, Luciano, and UMEK.</p>
      <p>Ultra Australia hit Sydney on Saturday March 7 and Melbourne on March 8 — <a href="https://ultraaustralia.com/">tickets are on sale now</a>, and will set you back $160 for general admission.</p>
