      <h1>Arsenal defender William Saliba facing lengthy spell out after suffering broken foot</h1>
      <h2>The on-loan centre-back broke his fifth metatarsal in Saint-Etienne's 1-0 win against Monaco on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:25:46+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>William Saliba faces yet another spell on the sidelines after suffering a broken foot in his Saint-Etienne side's 1-0 victory over Monaco at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old centre-back joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> for a fee of Â£27m from the French club during the summer but was immediately sent back on a season-long loan.</p>
      <p>He has suffered a frustrating campaign so far, missing the start of the season while he recovered from an abductor muscle injury.</p>
      <p>He has been an ever-present in the team since returning from that injury at the end of September, helping his side keep three clean sheets and move to eighth in Ligue 1.</p>

      <p>But after the match against Monaco St Etienne released a statement on their official website confirming Saliba had broken his fifth metatarsal, an injury which could keep him out for a number of weeks.</p>
      <p>The statement read: "William Saliba, victim of an injury against Monaco last Sunday, suffered a crack in his fifth metatarsal and will miss the confrontation against Oleksandriya in the Europa League."</p>
      <p>The news will come as a blow to Arsenal manager Unai Emery, who had decided Saliba could benefit with gaining extra experience in France before progressing to his first-team squad.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the decision to be sent back to Saint-Etienne, Saliba said: "Well, it was important first of all because I wanted to prove myself for another year at Saint-Etienne, before I come to try and establish myself here at Arsenal.</p>

      <p>"This is a big club, and when you come here, you need to be ready.</p>
      <p>"So I'm going to try and have a great season with the club that developed me in order to be ready for Arsenal."</p>
      <p>The Gunners next face a tricky-looking trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City in the Premier League, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-confirms-extent-dani-20828042">may have to do so without Dani Ceballos</a> , who went off holding his hamstring during his side's 1-1 draw with Vitoria in the Europa League on Wednesday.</p>
