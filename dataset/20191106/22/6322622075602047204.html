      <p>MILAN (Nov 7): Manchester City were made to wait to book a place in the Champions League knockout stages after Atalanta came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at San Siro on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling finished off a flowing City move early on before Gabriel Jesus squandered a golden chance to double their lead by rolling a tame penalty wide on the brink of halftime.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s side were made to pay for their profligacy when Mario Pasalic’s bullet header levelled the scores early in the second half.</p>
      <p>The home side threatened to snatch a winner after substitute City keeper Claudio Bravo was sent off late on, to be replaced in goal by outfield player Kyle Walker for the closing stages.</p>
      <p>City remain top of Group C with 10 points, five ahead of Shakhtar Donetsk and Dinamo Zagreb, while the draw earned Atalanta their first point in the competition. - Reuters</p>
