      <p>London - Saracens chairman Nigel Wray has insisted the club's all-conquering team will not have to be ripped apart after being deducted 35 points and fined more than Â£5 million for breaching the English Premiership's salary cap.</p>
      <p>The reigning English and European champions are appealing against the penalty after a nine-month investigation concluded they had broken the rules.</p>
      <p>Saracens boast a star-studded squad including Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola and Mako Vunipola, who started the Rugby World Cup final for England last weekend.</p>
      <p>However, Wray believes those that have come through the club's academy will stick by Saracens.</p>
      <p>"Just to clarify, there's no obligation whatsoever to get rid of any players," Wray said in a video published on the club's official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>"If you think it's about money, you're wrong.</p>
      <p>"It's about caring, it's about love, it's about working together, and I'm very proud of all of our players and indeed everybody at Saracens.</p>
      <p>"I'm proud of their achievements and I hope there will be many, many more achievements on the field and off."</p>
      <p>Wray is accused of contravening the cap by entering into co-investment deals with players.</p>
      <p>Some of those to have lost out on titles to Saracens over recent seasons have even called for stricter punishments to be imposed such as relegation or title stripping.</p>
      <p>Exeter Chiefs have lost the Premiership final in the past two seasons to Saracens.</p>
      <p>"They should be automatically relegated," the Chiefs' chairman Tony Rowe told The Times newspaper.</p>
      <p>Former England captain Chris Robshaw accused Saracens of "cheating".</p>
      <p>"The game we love is in the world eye and the pinnacle of English rugby is illegal. I think it puts our sport in a very dangerous place," said the Harlequins flanker.</p>
      <p>"This is cheating to a certain extent and it's not a good situation for our sport to be in."</p>
