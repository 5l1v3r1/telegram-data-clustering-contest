      <h1>Model Bella Lucia shares what she did with placenta after giving birth to her son: 'It can save his life'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:36:08+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>Model <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bella-lucia-before-and-after-baby">Belle Lucia</a>, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting">gave birth</a> last month, has revealed that she's decided to store her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/christina-anstead-ate-placenta-son-birth">placenta </a>in a cord blood bank in case <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/babies">her son</a> ever gets sick.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had a lot of questions asking what I did with my placenta ... no, I didn’t eat it,” Lucia captioned an Instagram video of her son on Wednesday. “But I did bank it so if my baby ever gets sick it can save his life.”</p>
      <p>Lucia shared that she gave her placenta and umbilical cord to Cells4Life, which bills itself as the “UK’s largest cord blood bank.”</p>

      <p>“The blood is rich in stem cells which treat as many as 80+ conditions in the future (if needed) such as cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes etc,” the model added.</p>

      <p>The blood left in the umbilical cord and placenta after a baby is born has “special cells” that can treat or cure some serious diseases, according to <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parents-save-babys-cord-blood-give-away-2017103112654">Harvard Health</a>.</p>
      <p>While some parents, like Lucia, choose to keep the cord blood for themselves, the <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/119/1/165.full.pdf">American Academy of Pediatrics </a>encourages parents to give it away to a public cord blood bank.</p>
      <p>Lucia’s post drew mixed reactions from her more than 1 million followers. Some fans said they wish that they were able to save their placenta or umbilical cord, but it was too expensive.</p>

      <p>Some commenters, however, slammed the British model for storing her cord blood for personal use rather than donating to a public bank.</p>
      <p>“A shame you didn’t use a public bank!” one person said. “Actually shown to be more effective than own-samples. This is a commonly misunderstood fact.”</p>
      <p>Others admitted they weren’t even aware of the value of such cord blood banks.</p>

      <p>“Had no idea this was ‘a thing’! Fabulous!” one follower commented.</p>
      <p>“Oh wow I swear they never told me about ‘banking’ my placenta,” another person wrote. “What a shame. Mine just went to waste then.”</p>
