      <p>Shoko Nakagawa’s connection to <i>Pokémon</i> runs deep. She’s hosted several of the variety shows, including <a href="https://www.pocketmonsters.net/content/Pokenchi"><i>Pokénchi</i></a>, which currently airs in Japan. She has done <i>Pokémon</i> commercials and press conferences, she’s sung <i>Pokémon</i> anime theme songs, and she’s even voiced characters. Now, she’s doing animation.</p>
      <p>If you are keeping score, Nakagawa started hosting variety show <i>Pokémon Sunday</i> in 2006, before going on to hosting <i>Pokémon Smash</i>, <i>Pokémon Get TV</i>, and <i>Pokénichi</i>. She has voiced characters in all the <i>Pokémon</i> animated feature films since 2007, including major characters. Besides singing the <i>Pokémon Sunday</i> theme, she also sang songs for <i>Pokémon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life</i> and the <i>Pokémon XY</i> anime. Now, add “animator” to her resume.</p>
      <p>Nakagawa is a skilled artist, so considering all the <i>Poké</i> things she’s done, this seems inevitable. Below are the frames that she illustrated as well as how they will appear in the last <i>Pokémon Sun &amp; Moon</i> episode.</p>

      <p>I cannot think of any celebrity who has been more involved with Pokémon than Nakagawa. </p>
