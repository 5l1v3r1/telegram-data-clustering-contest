      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A jury has recommended a life sentence with no chance of parole for an Ohio man who killed two suburban police officers responding to a 911 hang-up call.</p>
      <p>Quentin Smith was convicted Nov. 1 of two counts of aggravated murder for fatally shooting Westerville officers Eric Joering and Anthony Morelli in February 2018.</p>
      <p>Franklin County prosecutors said Smith killed the officers in an exchange of gunfire after opening his apartment door. Smith was shot five times.</p>
      <p>The jury recommended life Wednesday instead of a death sentence. Judge Richard Frye will formally sentence Smith in about two weeks. He can't override the jury.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Frederick Benton didn't dispute that Smith shot the officers, but said it happened in "a moment of chaos, panic and crisis."</p>
