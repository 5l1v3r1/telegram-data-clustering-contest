      <h1>Qualcomm's upbeat profit forecast, results send shares higher</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:24:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Qualcomm has forecast current-quarter profit above Wall Street expectations and beaten estimates for fourth-quarter revenue from its closely watched licensing business, sending its shares up five per cent in extended trading.</p>
      <p>The world’s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips expects between 1.75bn and 1.85bn smart devices with modem chips, including 175m to 225m 5G handsets, to be sold in 2020.</p>
      <p>As Qualcomm collects license fees on devices that use cellular connections to wireless data networks, more total devices sold often results in higher revenue and profits for the company.</p>
      <p>The results come a week after Apple almed Wall Street nerves with an improvement in sales in China, the world’s largest smartphones market, and follow strong earnings from chipmaker Intel last month.</p>
      <p>Qualcomm, which generates most of its profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers and others, said revenue in the segment was $1.16bn (£900m), beating estimates of $1.10bn, according to Factset.</p>
      <p>Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of 71 cents.</p>
      <p>Revenue in the fourth-quarter fell about 17 per cent to $4.81bn, but beat analysts’ estimates of $4.70bn.</p>
      <p>The company expects first-quarter adjusted profit of $1.20 per share, above estimates of 83 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
