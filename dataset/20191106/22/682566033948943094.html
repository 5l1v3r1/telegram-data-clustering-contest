      <p>Munich -Â Managerless <b>Bayern Munich</b> reached the <b>Champions League</b> last 16 on Wednesday with two games to spare as Robert Lewandowski helped inspire a low-key 2-0 win over Olympiakos.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski's goal, his 21st in 17 games this season, was the highlight of a dull encounter at the Allianz Arena before substitute Ivan Perisic added a late second.</p>
      <p>The victory ensures Group B leaders Bayern reach the knockout stage for the 12th straight season.</p>
      <p>Interim coach Hansi Flick got off to a winning start having stepped in after Niko Kovac was sacked on Sunday following a 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Bayern expect to name a new coach by their next away game at Fortuna Duesseldorf on November 23, but Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel have already ruled themselves out.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Kovac's sacking, sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic called for a "positive" display, but Bayern's stars struggled to deliver.</p>
      <p>Flick made two key changes by dropping both Thiago Alcantara and Philippe Coutinho, both of whom were poor at Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Leon Goretzka took Alcantara's place in midfield, with Mueller replacing Coutinho and Javi Martinez playing at centre-back instead of Jerome Boateng, who was sent off against Eintracht.</p>
      <p>But Bayern still needed more than an hour to finally breach Olympiakos' defence.</p>
      <p>Just a month ago, Bayern trounced Tottenham 7-2 in north London with Serge Gnabry scoring four goals, but the German champions could not match that display.</p>
      <p>Their first clear chance came when winger Kingsley Coman cut inside with 33 minutes gone, but fired at Olympiakos goalkeeper Jose Sa.</p>
      <p>The 'keeper then denied Mueller moments later while right-back Benjamin Pavard headed off the post on the stroke of half-time.</p>
      <p>Bayern had a better start to the second half as Goretzka's header forced Sa into a good save.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski broke the deadlock on 69 minutes when he flicked Kingsley Coman's low cross past Sa.</p>
      <p>The second goal was created by two second-half substitutes as Corentin Tolisso's ball found its way to Perisic, who lashed the ball into the net.</p>
