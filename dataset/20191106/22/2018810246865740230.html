      <p>Pro-gamer <a href="https://capcomprotour.com/players/fuudo/">Fuudo</a> is a world-class <i>Street Fighter</i> players around. Yuka Kuramochi is a very popular pin-up model. The couple just announced their marriage. The two became friends in an arcade and thanks to a <i>Street Fighter IV</i> tournament.</p>
      <p>Though there is this humorous image floating around with Kuramochi and her future husband sitting despondently in a chair, the two had actually met way before this—prior to the Razer endorsements and even before Fuudo went pro.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://blogos.com/article/415195/"><i>Blogos</i></a>, the couple revealed that they met about ten years ago. “I wasn’t a pro-gamer at the time,” Fuudo said, “but often went to game centres.”</p>
      <p>“Friday was the day that all the really great players gathered at the game centre,” Kuramochi recalled. “Players who are now pros like Daigo Umehara and Tokido came, too. I was watching these great players get together and compete, and that’s where we became friends.”</p>

      <p>Via Twitter, she added that since they became friends through <i>Street Fighter IV</i>, their marriage is a “Capukon” (カプ婚), a word play on “Capcom” with <i>kon</i> (婚) meaning “marriage.”</p>
      <p>The couple first started discussing marriage about two years ago. Now that they’ve tied the knot, both will continue with their respective careers. Besides modelling, Kuramochi also overseas a woman’s pro-gaming team called G-Star.</p>

      <p>We wish them both much happiness.</p>
