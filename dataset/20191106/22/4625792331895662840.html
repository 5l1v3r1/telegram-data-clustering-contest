      <h1>Rudy Giuliani hires legal defense team as feds investigate his Ukraine work</h1>

      <p>Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has hired a legal defense team to represent him as he is <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-under-investigation-for-ukraine-work">investigated for his Ukraine work</a>.</p>
      <p>The former New York City mayor made the announcement Wednesday on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1192180682296045568">saying</a> he is "represented and assisted" by attorney Robert Costello. He also said he is being represented by Eric Creizman and Melissa Madrigal of the Pierce Bainbridge law firm.</p>
      <p>Costello is the same attorney who said he was speaking to Giuliani when he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/13/politics/michael-cohen-email-costello/index.html">emailed</a> President Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen in April 2018 that he could "sleep well tonight" because he had "friends in high places." Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan opened an investigation into Giuliani to determine whether he broke lobbying laws with his dealings with Ukraine. Authorities also arrested associates of Giuliani who were helping him look into allegations of collusion between the Democrats and Ukraine and an allegation Joe Biden improperly used his role as vice president to pressure Ukraine to lay off investigating a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/john-kerrys-son-cut-business-ties-with-hunter-biden-over-ukrainian-oil-deal">natural gas firm that employed his son Hunter Biden</a>.</p>
      <p>"The investigation I conducted concerning 2016 Ukrainian collusion and corruption, was done solely as a defense attorney to defend my client against false charges, that kept changing as one after another were disproven," Giuliani tweeted Wednesday. "The evidence, when revealed fully, will show that this present farce is as much a frame-up and hoax as Russian collusion, maybe worse, and will prove the President is innocent."</p>

      <p>Last month Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/one-sided-witch-hunt-trump-defends-legendary-giuliani-amid-reports-hes-under-investigation">defended his lawyer</a>, who has resisted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/10/15/4cdc9b70-eecd-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html">cooperating</a> with the House impeachment effort, saying he is being attacked in a "one-sided Witch Hunt."</p>
