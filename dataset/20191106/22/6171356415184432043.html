      <h1>Get a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Note 9 for $380 ($345 off) on eBay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:33:08+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/david-oh/" target="_blank">David Oh</a></address>
      <p>Even after a year since its release, the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-note9/">Samsung Galaxy Note 9</a> is a powerful top-tier phone. It has a ton of features, but the $1,000 launch price was tough to swallow. If you're still in the market for a pen-toting, all-around great performer of a smartphone, then consider this refurbished Galaxy Note 9 <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;pub=5574915657&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5336677250&amp;customid=&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Note9-N960U-128GB-Factory-Unlocked-Smartphone%2F254279015307%23viTabs_0">deal on eBay</a> that has the phone at a very low price of $380 ($345 below MSRP).</p>
      <p>When our <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/16/galaxy-note9-review-1000-one-get/">David Ruddock reviewed the 128GB Galaxy Note 9 last year</a>, he said it was probably the best smartphone you can buy. It's a year old now, but it's still worth considering. The phone comes with all the characteristics you'd expect from a proper flagship: fast SoC (Snapdragon 845), 6GB RAM, 128GB UFS 2.1 internal storage, big and bright display, generous 4,000 mAh battery that lasts an entire day and some more, and top-level photography chops. Unique to the Note line, of course, is the S Pen, which is handy for note-taking, doodling, and using it as a camera shutter button.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy Note 9 that's been posted on eBay is of the unlocked variety, meaning you can use it with any carrier in the US. The Note 9 still sells for an expensive $725 brand-new so if minor scratches and scuffs don't bother you that much (you could always cover them up with a case), then picking up a refurbished unit for $380 is a great value proposition.</p>
      <p>Note that the phone will not arrive in its original packaging, but a UL-certified cable and power adapter will be included. Shipping is free and the seller accepts returns within 60 days.</p>
