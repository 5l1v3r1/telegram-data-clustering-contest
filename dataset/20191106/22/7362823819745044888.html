      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/reality">Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino </a>is firing back at folks who claim his newer fit physique is the product of steroid use.</p>
      <p>After the official “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/jersey-shore">Jersey Shore</a>” Instagram account shared a photo of “X-Men” star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/hugh-jackman-and-ryan-reynolds-call-truce-to-fake-feud-with-ads-for-each-others-beverage-companies">Hugh Jackman </a>posing with “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/jersey-shore">Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a>” stars <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nicole-snooki-polizzi-critic-drink-alcohol-breastfeeding">Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jersey-shore-angelina-jwoww-flirting">Angelina Pivarnick</a>, Sorrentino, 37, felt it necessary to inform a commenter who suspected him of using performance-enhancing drugs that his results are due to a myriad of factors, none of which include steroids.</p>

      <p>“I am flattered you think I am on performance enhancing substance but I am not,” Sorrentino wrote. (via Us Weekly) “I am on probation and get tested biweekly for illegal substances. What you see is hard work, determination, proper diet, exercise, muscle memory, intermittent fasting, prison and genetics. You should try it sometime!! People love to throw shade on what shines. Stay in your own lane and run your own race cuz!! Do you even lift !? #clapbackseason.”</p>
      <p>Sorrentino, who has dropped 35 pounds, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mike-the-situation-sorrentino-weight-loss-prison">detailed his prison regimen</a> during an interview with Entertainment Tonight in September after he was released following an eight-month stint behind bars in Otisville, N.Y. for tax evasion.</p>
