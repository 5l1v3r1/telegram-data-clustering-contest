      <p>ATHENS: Cyprus on Wednesday (Nov 6) said it had started a process to strip 26 individuals of citizenship they received under a secretive passports for investment scheme.</p>

      <p>"The Council of Ministers today affirmed the will of the government for strict adherence to the terms and conditions of the Cyprus investment programme," he added.</p>
      <p>Petrides did not disclose the nationalities or identities of the individuals concerned, but a Reuters investigation last month revealed wealthy relatives and allies of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen had received Cypriot passports under the scheme.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen has previously denied opposition allegations that members of his inner circle had passports from other countries and lived the high life overseas.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Greek newspaper Politis reported on Sunday that Malaysian fugitive businessman Jho Low was in possession of a Cyprus passport. </p>
      <p>The report alleged that Low arrived in Cyprus in September 2015 and obtained the passport two days later through the Cyprus Investment Plan.</p>
      <p>The scheme requires an interested party to deposit €5 million (US$5.6 million) in a local bank for three years and allows them to buy a house.</p>
      <p>The report also claimed Low had commissioned a €5 million mansion on the island, due for completion and delivery within two months.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Malaysian police said Low had attempted to purchase properties in Cyprus under a different name. </p>
      <p>Police chief Abdul Hamid Bador later clarified the authorities believed Low was hiding in a remote country, but that he was not in the Cyprus islands. </p>
      <p>"It's impossible for him to get out of his hiding place so easily. He is still there hiding like a chicken," he said.</p>
      <p>Low has been charged in Malaysia and the United States over the alleged theft of US$4.5 billion from 1MDB, set up by former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.</p>
