      <h1>Amazon Australia signs up Zip Co buy now, pay later service</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T01:01:01+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 01:01</time> by <a rel="author">Nikhil Nainan</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - Amazon Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O">AMZN.O</a>) Australia unit has signed up Zip Co Ltd (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/Z1P.AX">Z1P.AX</a>) to offer its buy now, pay later (BNPL) service on the U.S. giant’s local retail website, sending shares in Zip soaring by more than 20%.</p>
      <p>The deal with the world’s biggest retailer is a massive boost for Sydney-based Zip, a relatively small player in the crowded and fast-growing BNPL sector. Its payment system went live on the Amazon Australia site on Thursday.</p>
      <p>As part of the deal, Zip will issue warrants to an affiliate of Amazon for it to buy as much as 14.6 million of its shares, representing around 4.2% of outstanding shares. The warrants may be exercised for seven years from the issue date.</p>
      <p>Zip shares jumped as much as 24.1% shortly after the market open to A$4.27, their biggest intraday jump in nearly two years.</p>
      <p>Installment-based payment options have become very popular, especially with Millennial and Gen Z shoppers, because they bypass the interest rates and many regulations associated with taking out a credit card. BNPL companies make money from vendor payments and penalty payments when shoppers are late paying back a loan.</p>
      <p>Jun Bei Liu, a portfolio manager at Sydney-based Tribeca Investment Partners, said the deal was a win for both Zip and Amazon. BNPL services serve a “very strong purpose, particularly in a slower retail environment” by attracting customers to particular retail sites, she said.</p>
      <p>However, the success of the BNPL sector has also brought greater regulatory scrutiny. Last month, the Reserve Bank of Australia said it planned to dig deeper into the sector next year.</p>
      <p>Those concerns helped end a steady rise in BNPL company shares. Zip had leaped in value from around A$1 at the start of 2019, peaking at $5.86 last month.</p>
      <p>Financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC earlier this year demanded an external auditor report of Afterpay Touch Group (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/APT.AX">APT.AX</a>), which is seen as a bellwether of the sector, for suspected non-compliance with money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.</p>
