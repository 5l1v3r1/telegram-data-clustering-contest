      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:41:19+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author">Bradford Betz</a></address>
      <p>Prosecutors on Wednesday charged a white Milwaukee man with a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/hate-crime">hate crime</a> for allegedly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/milwaukee-police-arrest-man-acid-hate-crime">throwing acid</a> on a Hispanic man's face last week.</p>
      <p>Clifton Blackwell, 61, was already facing a charge of first-degree reckless injury. The authorities added hate crime and dangerous-weapon charges that could increase his sentence if he's convicted.</p>

      <p>The victim, Mahud Villalaz, a 42-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Peru, said his attacker approached him near a restaurant on Friday and confronted him about parking too close to a bus stop, charging documents say.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Blackwell asked, "Why did you invade my country?" and, "Why don't you respect my laws?"</p>
      <p>Villalaz said he moved his car but Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him "illegal" and telling him to "go back, go back.”</p>
      <p>Villalaz said he called Blackwell a racist. After telling Blackwell "everyone comes from somewhere first," Blackwell allegedly threw acid on him, Villalaz said.</p>

      <p>Surveillance video from the restaurant recorded the attack, which left Villalaz with second-degree burns on his face. Investigators who searched Blackwell's home found four bottles of sulfuric acid, muriatic acid, and two bottles of Kleen-Out drain opener, according to the search warrant.</p>

      <p>Blackwell does not yet have an attorney, according to court records. His family said he’s a Marine Corps veteran who served during the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. A Marine official told The Associated Press that the branch has no record matching Blackwell’s name and birthdate.</p>
      <p>His mother, Jacqueline P. Blackwell, told The <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/06/hate-crime-charged-acid-attack/2510357001/">Journal Sentinel</a> he had sought care with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Milwaukee for post-traumatic stress.</p>

      <p>State court records show Blackwell was convicted in a 2006 Rusk County case of false imprisonment and pointing a gun at a person in a case where he held four hunters at gunpoint because they were on his property.</p>
