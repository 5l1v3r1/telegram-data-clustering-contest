      <p>Americans will be able to save just a little bit more in some of their retirement accounts in 2020.</p>
      <p>The Internal Revenue Service announced it is increasing its 401(k), 403(b) and most Thrift Savings Plans deferred contribution limit to $19,500 next year, up from $19,000 in 2019. Catch up contributions are also jumping $500, to $6,500 in 2020. That means Americans 50 years and older can contribute a total of $26,000 in 2020.</p>
      <p>The maximum contribution for individual retirement accounts will remain at $6,000, as will the catch-up contribution for those accounts (at $1,000). SIMPLE plans are going up to $13,500 next year, from $13,000 in 2019.</p>
      <p>The IRS has also <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-19-59.pdf">adjusted</a> the income limits for eligible deductions of IRA contributions. The phase-out range determines if a taxpayer can claim a deduction on their federal income tax return for their IRA contributions — someone who earns between the range would be limited in what they can claim, whereas someone earning past the range would not be able to claim a deduction. Taxpayers who are not covered by an employer-sponsored plan can deduct their contributions in full, according to the IRS.</p>
      <p>The new limits, beginning Jan. 1, 2020, are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The phaseout range for single account holders of traditional IRAs and heads of household who are active participants of a plan is $65,000 to $75,000;</li>
        <li>For married couples filing jointly, where the spouse who makes the IRA contribution is an active participant in a qualified account, the phase-out range is between $104,000 and $124,000;</li>
        <li>For an IRA contributor who is not an active participant but is married to someone who is, the range is $196,000 and $206,000;</li>
        <li>And for married individuals filing separately, the phase-out range for an active participant remains at $0 to $10,000.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars, have separate income limits and no deductions, and are held to these phase-out ranges for making contributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In 2020, singles and heads of households have an adjusted gross income range between $124,000 and $139,000;</li>
        <li>Married taxpayers filing jointly have a phase-out range between $196,000 and $206,000;</li>
        <li>And for married individuals filing separately, the phase-out remains at $0 to $10,000.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The total contribution limit to 401(k) and similar plans increased to $57,000, up from $56,000, and would include employee contributions as well as employer contributions.</p>
      <p>Many Americans don’t max out their 401(k) plans. Only 13% of participants did so in 2017, when the limit was $18,000, according to a 2018 Vanguard report about its investors, and they were typically participants who had higher incomes, were older and had a longer tenure at their employers. Comparatively, 9.1% of Fidelity investors with a 401(k) plan had maxed out their accounts in 2018, up from 9% in 2017 and 8.1% at the end of 2013.</p>
