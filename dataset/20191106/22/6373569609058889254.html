      <p>The name you choose your baby will define their character growing up.</p>
      <p>Choosing the right name can be the most difficult thing you'll ever have to do - apart from giving birth, of course.</p>
      <p>Baby name traditions come and go, but in a new list compiled by baby name website <a href="https://nameberry.com/blog/top-baby-names-2020">Nameberry</a> some very out-there suggestions have been thrown into the mix.</p>
      <p>The website has revealed its predictions for what could be the top 20 most popular baby names in 2020 and there are some interesting ones on the list.</p>
      <p>And if you're struggling with picking a name for your unborn child, or are going to be thinking about it soon, the following list might help.</p>
      <p>In order to create the top 20, the team at Nameberry work out which names in their database have seen the biggest increase in interest over the last year, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/most-popular-baby-names-2020-20827666">reports the Mirror Online</a>.</p>
      <p>It seems parents are getting back in to old fashioned names like Pearl, which was a top 100 name from 1880 through the mid-1920s, when it started a long decline. But it's recently been making a big comeback.</p>

      <p>Other names to make the cut take inspiration from pop culture events or celebrities, like Billie (Billie Eilish).</p>
      <p>Nameberry says: "Our top baby names are a radical departure from the official national list, which suffers from a considerable time lag. We won't know which names were  <i>really</i>  used the most often for babies in 2020 until May of 2021.</p>
      <p>"The names here offer baby namers a heads up on trends and specific names destined to get more popular in 2020 and beyond."</p>
