      <h1>'It’s a shame' - West Brom defender determined to impress after Nathan Ferguson suspension</h1>
      <h2>Latest West Bromwich Albion news | The Baggies full-back made his first league start in Monday night's win over Stoke and is keen to keep his place in Slave Bilic's starting line-up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:30:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Suart, https://www.facebook.com/West-Brom-reporter-Paul-Suart-1706553162899720/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion left-back Conor Townsend has never been more desperate to impress after finally breaking into the team.</p>
      <p>Opportunity has knocked for Townsend with Kieran Gibbs out injured and his replacement, rookie academy product Nathan Ferguson, serving a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-suspensions-hull-city-17172721">three-match suspension</a>.</p>
      <p>Their absence paved the way for Townsend’s first league start of the season in the win over Stoke on Monday night when <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion </a>kept only their third clean sheet.</p>
      <p>And the 26-year-old has no intention of relinquishing his jersey - not with a trip to hometown club <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hull-city-west-brom-tactics-17209403">Hull</a>, where he started his career as an eight-year-old, on the immediate horizon.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I have always been waiting for my chance and this is an opportunity now for me,” the former Scunthorpe defender said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a shame for Nathan because he’s been brilliant in the team and Gibbo is still injured, which is a shame too, but it is a chance for me.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I can take it, kick on and prove I’m the one that should play there.”</p>

      <p>At times last season, when called on to deputise for Gibbs, Townsend struggled with the fast pace and physicality of the Championship in his first campaign in the second tier.</p>
      <p>He feels he has acclimatised and is right at home in a team pushing for automatic promotion.</p>
      <p>“When I first came here I was new to the league,” he said. “I had played a lot of games at lower league level, but it’s different when you step up.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But I’m confident in my own ability. I know I’m good enough to be in this team.</p>
      <p>“And with us fighting at the top end of the table I just want to keep doing that and keep on proving myself.”</p>
