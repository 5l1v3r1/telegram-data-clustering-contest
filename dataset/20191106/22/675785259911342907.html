      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Helen McCourt, whose body has never been found, was murdered by Ian Simms but he may now be freed from prison</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:51:51+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author">Louie Smith, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, Fiona Duffy</a></address>
      <p>The family of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murder</a> victim Helen McCourt – whose body has never been found – will today plead with judges: “Don’t release Helen’s killer to dance on her secret grave.”</p>
      <p>Mum Marie, 76, celebrated three weeks ago when a Bill to introduce Helen’s Law was unveiled after years of campaigning.</p>
      <p>It means killers could be denied parole for not revealing where their victims are.</p>
      <p>But Marie fears it may come too late to stop Helen’s killer, Ian Simms, 63, being freed after this week’s parole hearing.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his possible release, she said: “The thought horrifies me. I cannot think of one good reason anyone could possibly believe he is safe to be released.”</p>

      <p>Marie, supported by husband John Sandwell, 72, and son Michael, 51, will beg the hearing not to consider freeing Simms before the law comes into effect next year.</p>
      <p>In her victim impact statement she will tell of her “increasing distress” at having no answers when her grandchildren ask how their Aunt Helen died.</p>
      <p>And Michael, who was 19 when Helen, 22, was killed, will reveal his fears about the danger Simms poses to the family.</p>
      <p>Marie, who launched her campaign in the Mirror four years ago, said: “Learning the Ministry of Justice was going to introduce Helen’s Law was a dream come true.</p>

      <p>“I was able to sleep at night and think of my daughter without crying. We didn’t have her back but we had created a legacy in her name.</p>
      <p>“This hearing has sent me back to hell – giving my statement is traumatic.</p>
      <p>“Reading those words brings it all back to me – just how raw the pain still is of knowing she is out there somewhere. But I have to do it for my daughter.”</p>

      <p>Thursday marks the first time Michael has felt able to attend a hearing, aware it could be the last chance to keep Simms locked up. Marie, of Billinge, near Wigan, explained: “Michael never wanted to risk coming face-to-face with Simms.</p>
      <p>“Hearing Michael read his statement for the first time – revealing the pain he still endures – will break my heart.</p>
      <p>“I lost a daughter, he lost a sister and best friend and has never got over it.”</p>
      <p>Simms was given a life sentence in 1989, with a minimum 16-year term.</p>
      <p>The two-day hearing is taking place in London.</p>
