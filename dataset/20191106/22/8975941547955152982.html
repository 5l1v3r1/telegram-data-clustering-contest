      <h1>Do you double dip your chips? New report reveals surprising trans-Atlantic cultural differences</h1>

      <p>Double dipping chips at dinner parties has always been a social faux pas — the unhygienic practice was immortalized in a classic episode of “Seinfeld.”</p>
      <p>But 17% of British people think it’s OK to dip a chip — known as crisps on their side the pond, of course — into the dip, take a bite, and then dip again, according to new research. There was a caveat: Participants would only do this around friends and family.</p>
      <p>When among strangers, nine in 10 Brits would refrain, agreeing you shouldn’t “double dip” at social events with people you don’t know, as in the “Seinfeld” episode:</p>

      <p>The Waitrose &amp; Partners seventh annual Food and Drink Report, released on Wednesday, highlights quintessentially British traits and cultural differences with the U.S. from a poll of 2,000 U.K. people about their eating habits.</p>
      <p>In the northwest of Britain guests are most likely to take a packet of chips with them to a dinner party in case they get hungry later, with 16% saying they would do this. Almost a third, 30%, said they had eaten chips in bed.</p>
      <p>The report noted a swing away from materialism toward a desire for people to share more memorable experiences with loved ones.</p>
      <p>This fueled a revival of the crumpet, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/mar/21/how-to-cook-perfect-crumpets">the small bread-like cake that comes with holes on one side</a>, with sales rising by 27%. Whilst crumpets typically are smothered with hot butter, the current trend is toward a more refined culinary experience. Brits have been topping them with lobster, cockle butter or cheddar and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13541148">Marmite</a>.</p>
      <p>Posh crumpets, tahini, celery juice, food on skewers and pink drinks are among the year’s hottest food and drink trends.</p>
      <p>Rob Collins, managing director of Waitrose, the upmarket grocer, said: “This is the year that celery juice became a social-media star, that posh crumpets graced the tables in top restaurants, and that searches for ‘tahini’ on Waitrose.com rose by 700%.</p>
      <p>“Other food trends for the year include noodles, grains, seaweed, eco cleaning products and everything on a skewer.”</p>
      <p>The number of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beyond-meat-drives-flexitarians-to-del-taco-but-same-store-sales-still-fall-short-2019-07-30">flexitarians</a> in the U.K. continues to rise. A third of Brits are eating less meat and fish than two years ago, and 32% plan to reduce their consumption further over the next two years.</p>
      <p>Shoppers are most likely to choose free-range British meat, with the top factors influencing purchase being sourcing, provenance and welfare standards.</p>
      <p>The grocery chain said sales of vegan pre-prepared meals, which are bought and heated up offsite, have overtaken their vegetarian counterparts for the first time.</p>
      <p>Charcuterie has been reimagined, using seafood instead of meat to produce octopus salami, swordfish ham and shellfish sausages.</p>
      <p>By 2025 the report predicts dinner parties with a difference. Hosts will curate a fully personalized dining experience aimed at delivering specific physiological and emotional responses for each individual.</p>
      <p>How will this be possible? The guests will provide DNA samples ahead of the event, according to John Vary, a futurologist at the John Lewis Partnership, the parent company of Waitrose.</p>
