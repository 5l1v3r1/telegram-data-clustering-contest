      <h1>Biden running fourth place in Iowa: Poll</h1>

      <p>Joe Biden is in fourth place in Iowa, a new poll shows, offering a sobering assessment for the former vice president's candidacy less than 100 days before the nation's first nominating contest.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=3647">Quinnipiac University survey</a> released Wednesday gives Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren 20% support, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg 19%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 17%, followed by Biden at 15%.</p>
      <p>The poll echoes national surveys showing Warren leading the 2020 Democratic pack, with Biden slipping further down. It's also a boost for Buttigieg, who has mired in the single digits in national polls but is now seeing investment of time and resources in Iowa pay off.</p>
      <p>"Itâ€™s a race that is up for grabs," Quinnipiac polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement. "Half of likely Democratic caucus-goers who support a candidate say they may change their minds before February 3rd."</p>
      <p>The Quinnipiac survey is the second this month that placed Biden in fourth in Iowa. A <i>New York Times</i>/Siena College poll released on Nov. 1 found Biden with 17%.</p>
      <p>In multiple conversations with reporters, Biden's campaign team has repeatedly <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-comes-in-fourth-place-in-iowa-poll-as-buttigieg-rises">tempered expectations</a> about his chances in early primary contests such as Iowa and New Hampshire. They see a path to victory in states such as South Carolina with a heavy black population. Despite outlining that strategy, a number of Biden's donors and supporters have expressed concern that early losses could spell the end of his campaign.</p>
      <p>With the addition of the latest Quinnipiac's survey, Biden's position in the Iowa caucus has fallen further in the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-6731.html#polls">RealClearPolitics</a> average of polls. He now sits six points behind Warren, two points behind Buttigieg, and is in a statistical tie with Sanders for fourth place.</p>
      <p>The Quinnipiac poll also found Biden trailing much of the front-runners in support from young voters. Only 6% of Iowa Democrats age 18-49 support him, with 28% supporting Sanders and 24% backing Warren.</p>
      <p>In the poll, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota sits at 5%, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4%. Other candidates earned 3% or less.</p>
      <p>Quinnipiac surveyed 698 Iowa likely Democratic caucusgoers from Oct. 30 through Nov 5. The margin of error was +/- 4.5 percentage points.</p>
