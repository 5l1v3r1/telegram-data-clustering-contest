      <p>BELMONT, Bronx (WABC) -- Police have arrested a suspect in connection with a <a href="https://abc7ny.com/exclusive-victim-of-violent-bronx-elevator-attack-speaks-out/5669830/">violent attack inside a Bronx elevator.</a></p>
      <p>26-year-old Joshua Marrero of the Bronx is facing charges of assault.</p>
      <p>67-year-old Ray Diaz was followed from behind when he returned to his building lobby in the area of Southern Boulevard in Belmont Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>"I went downstairs to get a cigarette because I ran out of cigarettes - it was around 11-11:30," he said, "I saw somebody hold the door but I didn't think nothing of it. And I just walked in the elevator."</p>
      <p>That man, with a hoodie over his head, asked the victim what floor he was on - and then out of nowhere came the hard blow.</p>
      <p>"Somebody knocked me down, I couldn't get up from the floor," Diaz said. "He wouldn't let me get up from the floor. He kept kicking me and kicking me in my face. Only in my face."</p>
      <p>The attack was so brutal it left him with severe bruises and cuts to the face and arm.</p>
      <p>At first police believed it was a random attack because the victim indicated he did not know the attacker.</p>
      <p>But sources close to the investigation said the man later changed his story and told police he did know the suspect, saying the incident stemmed from a past argument the two had.</p>
