      <h3>Was MacDonald’s right to sack its chief executive for a consensual relationship with an employee?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Martin Townsend, a partner at communications consultancy Pagefield, says YES.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“You can’t help who you fall in love with” is one of the great romantic clichés.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, if you are the £12.3m-per-year boss of McDonald’s, this is not an excuse you can serve up – with or without fries.</p>
      <p>When Steve Easterbrook, the company’s Watford-born chief executive, embarked on a relationship with an employee, it mattered not a jot that he was divorced or that the affair was consensual. The company’s rules ban relationships with “direct or indirect subordinates”. Easterbrook was fired and accepted the decision.</p>
      <p>Was this an overreaction? Of course not. We live in the age of #MeToo, and McDonald’s has been facing claims about the sexual harassment of staff. Easterbrook’s case may have been unconnected, but it won’t have helped.</p>
      <p>But even without these factors, any relationship between a boss and subordinate has the whiff of an unfair power dynamic about it. It neither looks nor feels right in a working environment – and any attempt to make it seem so is clutching at stripy straws.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emma Long, commercial director of BizSpace, says NO.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Britons spending so much time at the office, and lines increasingly blurring between home and work, we need to take a modern approach to romances.</p>
      <p>One in five couples meet at work, while 1.4m couple-run firms exist in the UK, proving that successful relationships and successful businesses can coexist. Conducted maturely, an office romance should not affect either individual’s judgement, nor the wider team.</p>
      <p>We do not know whether Steve Easterbrook’s consensual relationship had any negative effect on McDonald’s, though the share-price reaction suggests that investors would have preferred him to stay. The difficulty in this case is the seniority of Easterbrook. But this is also not uncommon: US research suggests that 22 per cent of workers have dated their boss.</p>
      <p>The stakes are always high: couples meeting at work are more likely to marry than those meeting elsewhere, but six per cent of workers have left a job after a romance ended. Still, workplace romances should not automatically be a sackable offence.</p>
