      <p>A man holding a bouquet of flowers approached Junius Ho on Wednesday morning as the politician was campaigning with party members in his constituency of Tuen Mun, a town on the outskirts of Hong Kong near the border with China.</p>
      <p>The man gave Ho the flowers, asked to take a picture and then pulled a knife from his bag before striking his victim in the chest.</p>
      <p>Ho and his aides quickly subdued the man who could be heard shouting in Cantonese: "Junius Ho, you scum!"</p>
      <p>Police said three people were wounded in the incident, including the attacker.</p>
      <p>A police source, who declined to be named, told AFP that Ho received a stab wound to the left side of his chest and the attacker was arrested.</p>
      <p>Ho, 57, was conscious when he got into the ambulance.</p>

      <h3>Controversial figure</h3>
      <p>Alongside Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam and police chief Stephen Lo, Ho has become one of the most loathed establishment figures among democracy protesters.</p>
      <p>He has long been one of the most stridently pro-Beijing politicians in the city.</p>
      <p>But he shot to notoriety on 21 July after he was filmed shaking hands with a group of men in the town of Yuen Long who went on to beat protesters with sticks and poles, hospitalising 40 people.</p>
      <p>He has delivered multiple speeches supporting Hong Kong's police force and echoing Beijing's condemnations of protesters, often using incendiary language.</p>
      <p>Last month he accused a prominent opposition legislator of "eating foreign sausage" because she was married to a British journalist.</p>
      <p>After the Yuen Long attack, Ho's office was ransacked by protesters and the graves of his parents were also vandalised.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been upended by nearly five months of huge and increasingly <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/tear-gas-fired-hong-kong-marks-month-mask-ban-191105232319350.html">violent protests</a> calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Beijing and the city's leadership have taken a hard line against the protests, refusing concessions.</p>
      <p>With no political solution in sight, street fights have broken out on both sides of the ideological divide with growing frequency.</p>
      <p>Pro-<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a> supporters have attacked opponents throughout the summer, often in targeted assaults against prominent government critics and opposition politicians.</p>
      <p>Eight pro-democracy figures have been attacked, including protest organiser Jimmy Sham who was hospitalised last month by men wielding hammers.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, a man with a knife attacked democracy protesters including a local politician who had his ear bitten off.</p>
      <p>But the violence is far from one-sided.</p>
      <p>Crowds of pro-democracy protesters have also routinely beaten their ideological opponents, usually in spontaneous mob violence during rallies.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, a man was beaten unconscious and stripped naked in the district of Mongkok.</p>
      <p>Beijing has shown no willingness to meet the demonstrators' demands and activists show no sign of leaving the streets with 22 consecutive weekends of unrest.</p>
