      <p>The 51-year-old broadcaster has revealed that she had battled through two bouts of depression which left her "absolutely knackered."</p>
      <p>The periods of darkness in her life brought on anxiety and made her question whether she could competently continue with her TV and radio shows.</p>
      <p>Victoria was speaking to more than 500 business leaders at Women Mean Business Live in London, in which she was in conversation with The Telegraph's Bryony Gordon.</p>

      <p>During her revealing chat, Victoria said she was gripped with insecurity surrounding her job which took her down to her lowest ebb.</p>
      <p>She suffered a second bout of depression earlier this year, a decade after the first when she was broadcasting on BBC Radio Five Live.</p>
      <p>Victoria said that her second spell, which was just months ago, was brought on by the menopause.</p>

      <p>Speaking about how her days were getting crippled by the illness, Victoria said: "I was getting to a point where I was overwhelmed and waking up at 2am then not sleeping between 2am and 4.30am when I usually get up.</p>
      <p>"I was absolutely knackered and getting slightly anxious. I thought 'I'm not good at my job anymore'."</p>
      <p>It has been a difficult few years for Victoria, who had a very public battle with cancer in 2015.</p>
