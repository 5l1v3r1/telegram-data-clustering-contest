      <p>The shooter at a college Halloween party in East Texas killed two people and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910101077014531-suspect-in-texas-walmart-mass-shooting-pleads-not-guilty-in-court/">injured a dozen more</a>, AP reported.</p>
      <blockquote>According to a media report, Gonzales was arrested and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910271077159745-two-people-reportedly-dead-several-others-injured-at-college-party-in-texas-/">jailed on a capital murder charge</a> after an arrest affidavit claimed a confidential informant told the Hunt County Sheriff's Office that the suspect opened fire at a party hall outside Greenville, Texas, on 26 October.</blockquote>
      <p>Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said Tuesday in a statement cited by AP that additional information and the refusal of witnesses to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909011076697270-witness-describes-surreal-last-moments-of-odessa-texas-shooting/">cooperate with the investigation</a> undermined the case against the suspect.</p>
