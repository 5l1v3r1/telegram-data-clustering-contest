      <h1>New SNP councillor in Glasgow criticised over £600 expenses bill</h1>
      <h2>Anne McTaggart's "telephone and ICT" bill was nearly 15 times higher than her colleagues.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T04:30:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>The SNP’s newest councillor has been criticised over a £600 “telephone and ICT” <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lord-provost-who-blew-8000-20759858">expenses bill</a>.</p>
      <p>Anne McTaggart, who defected from Labour to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeons-advisors-horror-struck-20814581">the SNP</a> last week, incurred costs nearly fifteen times higher than her colleagues.</p>
      <p>Thomas Kerr, the leader of the Tory group on Glasgow council, said:</p>
      <p>“Just as the SNP ditch their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/lord-provost-eva-bolander-apologises-20765733">Lord Provost for her dodgy expenses</a>, they pick up another councillor spending more public money than necessary.</p>
      <p>“It’s clear Cllr McTaggart has found the right home among an SNP group willing to throw away taxpayers’ cash. This money would be far better spent on schools and roads.”</p>

      <p>McTaggart was a Labour MSP between 2011 and 2016 before she was effectively deselected by party members.</p>
      <p>She made a political comeback twelve months later when she was elected as a Glasgow councillor for Anniesland and Drumchapel.</p>
      <p>On Friday, she announced she had quit Labour to join the SNP, which runs the city council as a minority administration.</p>
      <p>McTaggart said: “I really want to be part of something positive. Labour hasn’t done anything positive of note for a long time in Glasgow.”</p>
      <p>Her defection was hailed by Nicola Sturgeon who wrote that it was “great” to “welcome” her to the party.</p>
      <p>However, McTaggart is facing questions about her latest “telephone/ICT” costs.</p>
      <p>Over 80 of the 85 councillors claimed less than £50 in this category, with the overwhelming majority billing the taxpayer for £41.58.</p>
      <p>Two councillors had bills of between £50 and £60, but McTaggart’s charge came to £606.33. At £765, she also had the second highest mileage bill.</p>
      <p>SNP councillor Graham Campbell was top of list for mobile phone costs - £4,579 - which was caused by him not switching off his data roaming on a trip to Africa. He has agreed to repay most of it to the council.</p>
      <p>In 2012, McTaggart's expenses claims as an MSP hit the headlines after she billed the taxpayer for a book called “Public Speaking and Presentation for Dummies”.</p>
      <p>McTaggart did not respond to the Record’s email.</p>
