      <p>A 20-year-old college student died after drowning in a hotel pool located in East Denpasar yesterday. According to hotel staff, the victim and his friends were using the facility without permission. </p>
      <p>“The victim died by drowning because he wasn’t very good at swimming,” <a href="https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/mahasiswa-tenggelam-saat-berenang-di-kolam-renang-hotel-di-denpasar.html">I Nyoman Karang Adi Putra, who heads the East Denpasar Police, told <i>Merdeka.</i></a></p>
      <p>The incident reportedly happened yesterday afternoon, when the victim, identified as Stepanus Lende from Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara, went to Oranjje Hotel for a swim with his two friends, identified as Stevan and Maksi. </p>
      <p>At first, they started swimming in the shallow pool, before Stepanus moved on to the 2-meter deep pool and soon began to yell for help. </p>
      <p>Stevan and Maksi quickly tried to rescue him from drowning, but was unable to pull him up – the two then ran to the front of the hotel to ask for help.</p>
      <p>“They pulled the victim up to the poolside, but he was already unconscious and not moving,” Karang Adi said. </p>
      <p>According to Sugiyono, a marketing staff at the Oranjje Hotel, no one had been aware of any swimming activities that day, as the boys had not asked for permission from management. </p>
      <p>Citing witness’ statement, Karang Adi said that Stepanus and his friends often went for a swim at the hotel without permission, and would run away whenever anyone approaches to reprimand them.</p>
