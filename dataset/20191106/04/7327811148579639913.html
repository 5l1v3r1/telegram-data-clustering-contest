      <p>HAWORTH, New Jersey (WABC) -- A reporter from New Jersey will go on trial in his native Nigeria Wednesday on charges of treason and money laundering.</p>
      <p>48-year-old Omoyele Sowore is the founder of a pro-democracy publication that uncovers corruption and misconduct in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Sowore lives in the Bergen County town of Haworth, where 95 yellow ribbons have been tied around a tree.</p>
      <p>They are for a father whose two young children don't know if they will ever see him again.</p>
      <p>"I have no way of truly knowing what the end objective is. My hope and prayer is that he's able to come home," said his wife, Opeyemi Sowore.</p>
      <p>Three months ago, Omoyele Sowore went to Nigeria to plan an anti-government protest.</p>
      <p>"I got a text from him telling him that he loves me and I said OK, love you too," said Opeyemi.</p>
      <p>It was the last time she has heard from him.</p>
      <p>Sowore, a permanent US resident, will go on trial in Abuja, Nigeria's capital.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Sowore, an American citizen, hasn't heard a word from the US government about her husband, and she has no idea what might happen at his trial.</p>
      <p>The ribbons, one for each day Omoyele has been held, come from the people of Haworth.</p>
      <p>"Every time I think about it I tear up," said Mrs. Sowore. "It's truly overwhelming and warms my heart to think the community came together knowing what happened to him. He's one of them, he's a dad, a friend, he runs with many of them in the community."</p>
