      <h1>Joe Biden accuses Elizabeth Warren of 'elitism'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T04:31:51+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 04:31</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> on Tuesday called Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, D-Mass., “condescending” and elitist for comments she made last week suggesting he was running in the “wrong presidential primary.”</p>
      <p>Biden made the comments at a Pittsburgh fundraiser and in an op-ed published in Medium Tuesday. He did not mention her by name, but wrote in the op-ed that her attacks represent an “angry unyielding viewpoint” with a "my way or the highway" approach to politics.</p>

      <p>“But it’s worse than that," he wrote. "It’s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.”</p>
      <p>Biden wrote that her jabs are an “elitism” that working and middle-class Americans don’t appreciate.</p>
      <p>Warren also said he was “repeating Republican talking points” when he criticized her recently unveiled Medicare for All plan.</p>
      <p>Biden and the other Democratic presidential candidates have stepped up their attacks on Warren recently as she surges in the polls, jockeying with Biden for the top spot.</p>
      <p>Biden concluded in the <a href="https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/i-have-fought-for-the-democratic-party-my-whole-career-2ca4a2dac271">op-ed</a> that Democrats need to stop elitist attacks on each other in order to beat President Trump.</p>

      <p>It’s not the first time Warren has been called elitist. Republican Sen. Scott Brown mockingly referred to her as “Professor Warren” when he unsuccessfully ran against her in Massachusetts in 2012.</p>
      <p>The Warren campaign has yet to comment on Biden's remarks.</p>
