      <p>LUCKNOW: A cricket carnival is around as 'hosts' Afghanistan look to take their cricket forward against the touring West Indians at the Ekana cricket stadium.</p>
      <p>With both the sides camping in the city for the month-long series, the fun fare will start on Wednesday with the opening One-dayer.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan, who have made the city their third home in India, play three ODIs, three T20Is and a one-off Test here.</p>
      <p>Having won the practice game on Monday, the Afghans will feel a little confident against a side which has the fire-power to blast any team in the shorter versions of the game.</p>
      <p>But with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/chris-gayle">Chris Gayle</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Carlos-Brathwaite">Carlos Brathwaite</a>, Fabian Allen and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kemar-Roach">Kemar Roach</a> not part of the squad, West Indies will have to search for alternatives.</p>
