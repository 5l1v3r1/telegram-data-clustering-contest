      <h1>Robert Pattinson’s Questionable French Accent In ‘The King’ Stole Our Hearts</h1>

      <p><i>The King,</i> Netflix’s historical drama starring Timothée Chalamet as an approximation of Shakespeare’s Henry V, has been receiving <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-king-film-review-timothee-chalamet-robert-pattinson-netflix/">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/the-king-henry-v-agincourt-timothee-chalamet-robert-pattinson-joel-edgerton">mixed</a> <a href="https://junkee.com/the-king-reviews-timothee-chalamet/220519">reviews</a> for being dreary, if not dull. But one standout, for better or worse, depending on your mileage, is Robert Pattinson as the Dauphin, rocking long frocks and a questionable French accent.</p>
      <p>While the David Michôd-directed film is clearly supposed to help transition Chalamet from twink-heartthrob to serious actor, it’s Pattinson who steals the show in a relatively small role. Appearing over an hour into <i>The King</i>, Pattinson commands attention as Henry’s rival due to an energy that can only be described as chaotic: where Chalamet plays things quite seriously, Pattinson has a lot of fun with his menacing role.</p>

      <p>Of course, Pattinson has less to prove, having spent his post-<i>Twilight</i> years working with <a href="https://junkee.com/robert-pattinson-batman/193687">some of our most celebrated auteurs</a> (David Cronenberg, the Safdie brothers, Clare Denis, Werner Herzog). Where Chalamet cut his locks up into an ugly-hot bowl cut, Pattinson can let his Legolas rip-off wig down. As <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/robert-pattinson-the-king-performance-timothee-chalamet.html"><i>Vulture</i> put it</a>, “<i>The King</i> gives us Pattinson at his zaniest, with an accent that is a total mismatch, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p>

      <p>As The Dauphin, Pattinson is ridiculous<i> and</i> ridiculously scary. When he and Henry first meet, he threatens the king by promising he will drain his body of his blood and bury it underneath a “little French tree”: the accent, an exaggeration of French normally reserved for improv troupes yelling about baguettes, both undercuts and heightens the unhinged menace.</p>

      <p>Not surprisingly, it’s gained a lot of attention online, particularly given the line where Pattinson says Chalamet has giant balls and a tiny dick. It’s a lot, particularly when you realise the British actor is faking as a French king across from Chalamet, an American who speaks French playing an English king. It’s pretty divisive.</p>

      <p>If you’re in the ‘wtf’ boat, it might change your opinion to know that Pattinson’s character was supposed to add a lightness to an otherwise overwhelmingly serious film.</p>
      <p>“I just had a feeling he would make it fun,” director David Michôd told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-king-director-cast-robert-pattinson-razzle-dazzle-1236028"><i>The Hollywood Reporter </i></a>back in September. “I needed that. He is a supporting character. He doesn’t appear in the movie until an hour in. It was very, very important to me that when he did appear it was with razzle-dazzle.”</p>
      <p>He maybe added a little <i>too</i> much razzle-dazzle though, with many online left wishing Pattinson’s character and accent featured <i>more</i> prominently, and co-star Ben Mendelson gushing in interviews, too.</p>
