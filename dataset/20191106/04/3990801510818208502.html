      <h1>Facebook is testing facial detection tech to keep bots at bay (update)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T04:10:19+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 04:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/ivanmehta/" target="_blank">Ivan Mehta</a></address>
      <p>In order to keep its social network free of malicious bots, Facebook keeps trying out new tactics.In its latest test, it’s deploying facial recognition tech to spot fake profiles.</p>
      <p>The feature, spotted by app researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1191697008605593600?s=20">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, asks you to take a video selfie and turn your head from side to side in order to verify that you’re not a bot.</p>
      <p><span dir="auto">The text in app screenshots posted by Wong reads, </span>“We need a short video of you turning your head in different directions. This helps us confirm your identity and check you’re a real person.”</p>

      <p>There’s no word on when this feature will roll out, or when it’ll be used. Also, there’s clarity at the moment on how Facebook will store and use this data.</p>
      <p>A Facebook spokesperson told TNW over an email that the company is experimenting with this feature to determine if a real person is operating the account:</p>
      <blockquote>This test is one of the steps we use to determine that a real person is operating an account rather than a bot. It does not use facial recognition. Instead, it detects motion and whether a face is in the video.</blockquote>
      <p>If the social networking firm thinks a profile is fake, it’ll ask them to submit a short selfie video for verification. It sounds just like facial recognition to identify real users.</p>
      <p>Wong also noted the social network is trying to improve its <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1191668052028313600?s=20">verification by ID process.</a> With these new methods, Facebook could help make its social network more secure – but it remains to be seen if people will feel comfortable sharing this sort of personal data with the company.</p>

      <p>Update (06/11/2019 15:18 CST): Changed headline text from “facial recognition” to “facial detection” to reflect Facebook’s official stance.</p>
