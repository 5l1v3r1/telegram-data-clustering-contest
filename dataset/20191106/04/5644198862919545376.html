      <p>SAINT PETERSBURG: RB Leipzig closed on a place in the knockout phase of the Champions League for the first time as goals by Diego Demme and Marcel Sabitzer gave the German side a 2-0 win away to Zenit Saint Petersburg on Tuesday (Nov 5).</p>
      <p>Captain Demme opened the scoring with a very rare goal in first-half stoppage time at the Gazprom Arena and Sabitzer added the second on 63 minutes.</p>

      <p>The result leaves Julian Nagelsmann's team on top of Group G with nine points from four games, five points ahead of Zenit and Lyon and six better off than Benfica before the latter two sides meet in France later.</p>
      <p>Leipzig will therefore have the chance to secure qualification for the last 16 when they host Benfica in the next round of games on NovÂ 27.</p>
      <p>They had been in prolific form coming into this trip to Russia, scoring 14 goals in their previous two outings with a 6-1 win at Wolfsburg in the German Cup being followed by a stunning 8-0 victory against Mainz in the Bundesliga at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The visitors had an early goal disallowed as Marcel Halstenberg fired home low into the net from outside the box in the 14th minute only for a VAR review to show Christopher Nkunku had been guilty of a handball in the build-up.</p>
      <p>As half-time approached, the Russian league leaders almost broke the deadlock when a Sardar Azmoun shot trickled agonisingly past the far post.</p>
      <p>Moments later it was Leipzig who went in front at the other end, Demme rifling home low into the bottom-left corner after a Sabitzer free-kick had been blocked by the Zenit wall.</p>
      <p>Germany striker Timo Werner was only on the bench for Leipzig at kick-off despite scoring five goals and laying on five more in their last two matches.</p>
      <p>However, he was introduced on 61 minutes and two minutes later he was involved as the visitors doubled their lead.</p>
      <p>Werner collected possession on the left and found Emil Forsberg, whose pass into the box was dispatched by Austrian international Sabitzer.</p>
      <p>He had also scored the winner when Leipzig beat Zenit 2-1 in the reverse fixture two weeks ago and his latest strike ensured there was no way back for the Russians.</p>
