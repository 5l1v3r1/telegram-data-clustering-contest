        <i>Helena Bonham Carter is dating a man 21 years her junior and has decried the use of the term ‘toyboy’</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Name:</b> Toyboy.</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> Considerably younger.</p>
      <p><b>Appearance:</b> Fit.</p>
      <p><b>Why does it have to be all about looks?</b> Because apart from youth, that’s the main bit of being a toyboy.</p>
      <p><b>Not necessarily.</b> Yes, necessarily.</p>
      <p><b>I’d like to hear your definition of toyboy, in that case.</b> Toyboy (n): a younger, handsome, well-built, not terribly bright lover.</p>
      <p><b>How dare you assume that’s what women are looking for in a toyboy?</b> Sorry, are you looking for an unattractive toyboy who is older than you?</p>
      <p><b>No, but why can’t a toyboy be much younger and also very clever?</b> I don’t know, but I can’t think of an example.</p>
      <p><b>What about </b><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/06/helena-bonham-carter-sought-princess-margaret-blessing-through-psychic-the-crown"><b>Helena Bonham Carter</b></a><b>’s boyfriend Rye Dag Holmboe?</b> The name doesn’t ring a bell. Can you describe him?</p>
      <p><b>Well, he</b><b> is 21 years her junior … </b>Classic toyboy.</p>
      <p><b>That’s unfair. “Toyboy is a really sexist remark,” Bonham Carter told the </b><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/helena-bonham-carter-interview-talking-toyboys-and-tiaras-with-the-crowns-princess-margaret-xzqh9fcq9"><b>Sunday Times magazine</b></a><b> recently. “It implies he’s got nothing to offer than his body.”</b> So his body’s no good?</p>
      <p><b>Bonham Carter acknowledged that his body is “fantastic”. “But along with the body,” she said, “he’s got a great mind and a great humour.”</b> I’m sure he’s very nice. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/09/my-partner-is-much-older-than-me-is-our-relationship-unsustainable">can two people born 21 years apart</a> have enough in common to sustain a relationship?</p>
      <p><b>Bonham Carter thinks so. “He’s an old soul in a young body,” she said. “What more could I want?”</b> “Old soul in a young body” is just code. It means either “socially awkward” or “can’t dance”.</p>
      <p><b>You’re just being intolerant now. Can you imagine someone implying that a man and his beautiful, much younger girlfriend had nothing in common?</b> I can, just about.</p>
      <p><b>So what if I told you that I, as a woman, was looking for a powerfully built younger man with whom I could foster an intellectual partnership </b><b>as well as a lasting intellectual bond?</b> I’d say OK, but that you’ve come to the wrong dating agency. We just pair toyboys with cougars – no funny stuff.</p>
      <p><b>Cougars?</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/12/age-difference-dr-luisa-dillner">Mature women looking for younger men</a> to toy with.</p>
      <p><b>How impossibly reductive. Isn’t there a more sophisticated approach</b><b>?</b> There is one website offering “a space free from all existing social connotations about age-gap relationships … facilitating members to build a genuine connection with one another”.</p>
      <p><b>Perfect. What’s it called? </b>Toyboy Warehouse.</p>
      <p><b>Do say:</b> “Listen, I don’t care how many A-levels you’ve got. Just don’t call me mummy and we’ll get along fine.”</p>
      <p><b>Don’t say:</b> “Well, this is awkward – I’m sure I wrote tomboy on my profile.”</p>
