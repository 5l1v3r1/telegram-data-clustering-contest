      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- The name for Lee County's newest high school is Gateway High School.</p>
      <p>The school board officially approved the name Tuesday.</p>
      <p>There had been some contention over the latest high school's name. But according to the district, “Gateway” was the clear front runner in the survey it conducted.</p>
      <p>The other three finalists the school board was considering were: Thomas Edison, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Gabriela Mistral High.</p>
      <p>Those names were among the most submitted in an <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/name-recommendations-for-new-lee-county-high-school-announced">open call for names</a> . Then an online survey to vote among those finalists resulted in <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/survey-results-in-for-new-high-school-being-built-in-lee-county">more than 60 percent of people voting for Gateway High</a> .</p>
