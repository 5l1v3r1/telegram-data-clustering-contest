      <p>BANGKOK (Nov 6): Thailand's central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate for a second time this year to bolster flagging growth while inflation remains subdued.</p>
      <p>The central bank said it would announce measures to encourage fund outflows to slow the baht's strength later on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Bank of Thailand's (BOT) monetary policy committee voted 5-2 to cut the one-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, a record low last seen during the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>Two members favoured no policy change.</p>
      <p>In a Reuters poll, a slim majority of economists — 15 out of 28 — predicted no policy change, while 13 others predicted a quarter-point cut.</p>
      <p>In August, the committee unexpectedly cut the rate by a quarter point, the first easing since 2015, before pausing in September.</p>
