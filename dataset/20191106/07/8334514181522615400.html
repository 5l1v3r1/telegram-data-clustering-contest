      <p>BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is unlikely to allow entry to Cambodian opposition founder Sam Rainsy, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Wednesday, after the self-exiled dissident said he planned to return to Cambodia via Bangkok.</p>
      <p>At a news conference in the Thai capital, Prayuth referred to Thailand’s ties with Cambodia as a fellow member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping.</p>
      <p>“According to our commitment to ASEAN, we will not interfere in each other’s internal affairs, and we will not allow an anti-government person to use Thailand for activism,” Prayuth said.</p>
      <p>“I have ordered this, so he probably won’t get in.”</p>
