      <h2>Spurs head to Serbia after thrashing Red Star a fortnight ago to keep their Champions League hopes alive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T07:30:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>It’s been a mixed start for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> in the UEFA Champions League this season but they remain on course to qualify for the knockout stages at the halfway point of the Group Stage.</p>
      <p>A draw against Olympiakos and a battering by Bayern saw Spurs slumping towards an early <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> exit before a resurgence against Red Star Belgrade now sees them firmly back in the mix.</p>
      <p>Yet they were in a worse situation last season, only picking up a point from their opening three fixtures and they still ended up competing in June's final against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Pochettino has come under a lot of pressure with his side currently sitting in the bottom half of the Premier League, out of the Carabao Cup and making a routine Champions League group look difficult. His side desperately need a win.</p>
      <p>Here’s all you need to know ahead of the game…</p>

      <h3>Team news</h3>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Son Heung-min will be included in the starting XI following his despairing reaction to Andre Gomes' horror injury on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The South Korean was visibly upset after being sent off for his involvement in the incident which marred the draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> .</p>
      <p>He has travelled to Belgrade with Spurs, and boss Pochettino has since claimed his forward is "in a very good way".</p>
      <p>Red Star meanwhile have no fresh injury concerns since the meeting between the sides two weeks ago.</p>
      <h3>Betting odds</h3>
      <p>Tottenham 7/10</p>
      <p>Draw 3/1</p>
      <p>Red Star Belgrade 15/4</p>
