      <p>BAGHDAD: Iraqi security forces opened fire on Wednesday to disperse protesters gathered on Baghdad’s Shuhada bridge, shooting live bullets in the air, a Reuters witness said.</p>
      <p>There appeared to be no casualties.</p>
      <p>Protesters had blocked the bridge since Tuesday afternoon as part of efforts to bring the country to a standstill, with thousands continuing to partake in anti-government protests in the capital and southern provinces.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Iraqi protesters have blocked the entrance to the Nassiriya oil refinery in the south, security and oil sources told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The protesters blocked the tankers that transport fuel to gas stations from entering the refinery, which caused fuel shortages across Dhi Qar province, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Also on Wednesday, a spokeskan for prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said the blocking of Iraq's major Umm Qasr port on the Gulf by anti-government protesters had cost the country over $6 billion so far.</p>
      <p>"The closure of Umm Qasr port harms the country. Hundreds of trucks are still parked. This issue is causing massive damage to the nation. Iraq's losses have exceeded $6 billion until now," said Abdul Kareem Khalaf in a news conference.</p>
