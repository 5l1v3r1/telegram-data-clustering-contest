      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The battery-powered August View doorbell camera is now on sale again.</li>
        <li>August had paused shipping the doorbell camera in April due to some performance issues that were reported by users.</li>
        <li>The wire-free doorbell camera now offers more reliable connectivity, improved video quality, faster notifications, as well as quicker device wake-up time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>August has <a href="https://august.com/blogs/home/the-august-view-is-back">announced</a> that its battery-operated View doorbell camera is now available for purchase once again. The company had to halt shipments of the device soon after its launch in April due to Wi-Fi connectivity problems. August View is currently available only from the company's website for $229.</p>
      <p>August says it has updated the device's software to address those issues and make the View much more reliable than before. In addition to improvements to Wi-Fi connectivity, the August View now boasts better video quality, faster notifications, as well as quicker wake-up time. While the Wi-Fi performance has now been improved significantly, the August View will still not operate if you have a Wi-Fi signal of less than -70dB.</p>
      <p>When it announced that it was pausing shipments of the View in April, August allowed its customers who had purchased the doorbell camera to keep it and receive a full refund in exchange for some information on their setup and installation.</p>
