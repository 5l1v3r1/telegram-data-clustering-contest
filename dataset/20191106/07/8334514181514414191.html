      <p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Seattle’s city council race was a toss-up between a pro-business and a progressive council on Tuesday night, despite record election campaign donations from big donors, including tech giant Amazon.com.</p>
      <p>Amazon donated $1.5 million to a “Super PAC” run by the local chamber of commerce, which endorsed candidates for the seven seats up for election in the nine-seat city council. Four years ago Amazon donated $25,000 to the political action committee.</p>
      <p>Marilyn Strickland, president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said late on Tuesday, “Tonight’s initial returns are not definitive enough to call these close races.”</p>
      <p>More ballots will be counted in the coming days, although a winner might be clear after the next count on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The bellwether race is between incumbent socialist Kshama Sawant who faces challenger Egan Orion, a small business advocate who directs an LGBT pride festival.</p>
      <p>Sawant trailed on Tuesday night with 28 percent of ballots counted and did not hit the minimum percentage in the first results that her campaign thought she needs to win.</p>
      <p>“We faced an onslaught of corporate cash,” Sawant said at an election night party. “If anything we underestimated the brazenness of (Amazon CEO Jeff) Bezos, corporate real estate, and big business.”</p>
      <p>Sawant’s campaign raised over $508,000 through individual donations that averaged $70.</p>
      <p>The Seattle metropolitan area’s growing problem with homelessness - King County has the third-largest homeless population after New York city and Los Angeles County - has been a key point of friction between Amazon and the city.</p>
      <p>Amazon spokesman Aaron Toso said in a statement earlier, “We are contributing to this election because we care deeply about the future of Seattle.”</p>
      <p>“We believe it is critical that our hometown has a city council that is focused on pragmatic solutions to our shared challenges in transportation, homelessness, climate change and public safety,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, the council approved a per-employee “head tax” on the city’s biggest companies to pay for homeless services and affordable housing - only to scale it back a month later when Amazon said it might freeze expansion planning for Seattle.</p>
      <p>In response to Amazon’s $1.5 million donation, Council member Lorena González proposed a bill in October that would prohibit “foreign-influenced corporations” from making political contributions in Seattle elections. The bill defines that as a company which has one percent or more of its shares held by foreigners or foreign entities.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Amazon.com declined to comment whether or not the company would constitute a foreign-influenced corporation under the proposed law.</p>
