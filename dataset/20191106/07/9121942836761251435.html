      <p>COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) — Democrats will hold a City Council majority in Vice President Mike Pence’s Indiana hometown for the first time since the 1980s if a candidate’s one-vote victory margin holds up.</p>
      <p>Unofficial results from Tuesday’s local election show Democrats winning a 4-3 Columbus City Council majority as they defeated two Republican incumbents. The (Columbus) Republic reports that Republican Councilman Dascal Bunch might seek a recount of the 260-259 tally favoring Democrat Jerone Wood.</p>
      <p>Bartholomew County Democratic Party chairman Bob Hyatt says the council victories came from young candidates stepping up and wanting to make a difference.</p>
      <p>Republican Mayor Jim Lienhoop was unopposed for reelection. He says city leaders have worked across party lines for a long time.</p>
      <p>The county clerk says Democrats last won a City Council majority in the 1983 election.</p>
