        <i>Operation Votey McVoteface aims to help people of no fixed address take part in election</i>
      </p>
      <p>Campaigners have launched a website seeking to help people without a fixed address, such as canal boat dwellers or sofa surfers, register to vote, after the Electoral Commission said just 2% of such people were on the electoral roll.</p>
      <p>The campaign, called <a href="https://mcvoteface.org.uk/">Operation Votey McVoteface</a>, says that in many constituencies there are enough potential voters without a permanent address to sway the result.</p>
      <p>Figures <a href="https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/media/original/30901-whos-on-londons-boats-survey-summary-report.pdf">from the Canal and River Trust</a> show that Hillingdon, the west London borough in which Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge constituency is based, is one of the most common places in the capital to which boat dwellers without a fixed berth have close links.</p>
      <p>While people with a permanent address can register to vote via a simple online system, those without must print out and fill in a five-page “declaration of local connection” <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/711758/Register-to-vote-if-you-havent-got-a-fixed-or-permanent-address-England-and-Wales.pdf">form</a> and sent it to their local electoral registration office.</p>
      <p>The campaign <a href="https://mcvoteface.org.uk/">has set up a website</a> aimed at helping people without a permanent address through the registration process and also providing information about the electoral balance of particular seats and how tactical voting could remove Conservative MPs.</p>
      <p>Official figures show that at least 175,000 people in the UK have no fixed address, whether because they are homeless, sofa surf, live on boats or are members of a travelling community.</p>
      <p>Sam Lund-Harket, a member of the Votey McVoteface campaign who lives on a houseboat, said: “The system discriminates against those living in temporary accommodation or part of a travelling community. These shockingly low registration figures prove that.</p>
      <p>“The Votey McVoteface website has put registration forms for people with no fixed address online in a fillable format for the first time, with guidance as to the information required and the process to follow.”</p>
      <p>Other constituencies with large numbers of residents living in canal boats include those in Milton Keynes.</p>
      <p>The group said rising housing costs in Bristol had led to the spread of people in insecure accommodation into nearby areas such as Jacob Rees-Mogg’s North East Somerset seat, which has significant numbers of people living on boats or in vans.</p>
