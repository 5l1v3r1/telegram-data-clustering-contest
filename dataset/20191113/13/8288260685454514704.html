      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been branded a "terrorist sympathiser" by a Church of Scotland minister during an election campaign visit.</p>
      <p>The jibe came as he was entering the Heart of Scotstoun community centre in Glasgow on Wednesday, when he stopped to tell broadcasters about a scarf he was wearing, which had been given to him by representatives of the Who Cares Scotland charity.</p>
      <p>But he was interrupted by Richard Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church, who shouted: "I thought you'd be wearing your Islamic jihad scarf.</p>

      <p>"Do you think that the man who is going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?</p>
      <p>"Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Mr Cameron then accused Mr Corbyn of "running away".</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Church of Scotland later rebuked Mr Cameron.</p>
      <p>She said: "The Church of Scotland as an organisation has a long history of engaging with politicians through a number of different channels.</p>
      <p>"Whilst we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured and allows for reasoned debate."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn did not react to Mr Cameron, and was then ushered into the community centre by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.</p>
