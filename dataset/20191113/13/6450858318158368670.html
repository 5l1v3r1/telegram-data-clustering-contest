      <h2>With the OnePlus 7T out now, it's getting harder to find good deals on the OnePlus 6T. We've scoured the web to find the best offers on the OnePlus 6T in the UK, both on contract and SIM-free</h2>

      <p>The OnePlus 6T has been replaced by the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro - so now 6T availability is limited outside the US. However, if you know where to look you can still pick it up from certain places in the UK. Here, we share the best OnePlus 6T deals around, whether you plan to buy SIM-free or on contract.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, read our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oneplus-6t-3685825/">full OnePlus 6T review here,</a> grab one of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/mobile-phone/best-oneplus-6t-cases-3685902">best cases for the OnePlus 6T</a>, and check out the deals below.</p>
      <h3>OnePlus 6T price &amp; availability</h3>
      <p>The OnePlus 6T is no longer available directly from OnePlus but you can still find some models on Amazon if you want to buy SIM free. The phone sells for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07HHG6CXS?ascsubtag=06-3685837-11-0000000">£529 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage</a>. That's still a bit much to pay for a year-old phone though, especially with newer models now available, though we're hoping prices might drop as we get closer to <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>The phone is a bit tricky to find in part because it's not the latest model any more. If you'd rather grab one of the more recent phones, then see our round up of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/mobile-phone/best-oneplus-7-pro-5g-deals-3696838">best OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro deals</a> or check out the even newer <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/oneplus-7t-3700351/">OnePlus 7T</a>. </p>
