      <h3>Rights go both ways</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Cherry fired for ‘divisive’ poppy rant, Nov. 12</b>
      </p>
      <p>Canada is a free country. You can say whatever you want and do whatever you please, within reason. That includes not wearing a poppy or criticizing those who do not.  Broadcast employees are held to a certain standard, most have signed contracts with behavioural clauses that spell out what is and is not within the boundaries of the company. Usually those boundaries are in step with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council.</p>
      <p>Don Cherry was within his rights as a citizen to say what he said, however Rogers was within their rights to pull the trigger on whatever contract clause he signed off on. Freedom always comes with consequences.</p>

      <h3>Message lost</h3>
      <p>This whole issue is unfortunate. The message that Don Cherry should have tried to get across was that “ALL Canadians” should be wearing a poppy on Remembrance Day. I am Canadian, born and raised, and sometimes I do not wear a poppy each year. This whole controversy made me think about it more and wear a poppy myself.</p>

      <h3>Soldiers fought for freedom of speech</h3>
      <p>It’s ironic that Don Cherry was fired for doing what Canadian soldiers fought for, freedom of speech! This event clearly displays how low Canada has sunk. In Canada, if you are privileged, elite, racist, unethical, corrupt and a misogynist, you keep your job, while others who are guilty of a fraction of those crimes, are fired.</p>

      <h3>Choice is part of freedom</h3>
      <p>On Friday, my community mosque was filled with over 100 “you-people” who participated in a Remembrance Day ceremony. Similar ceremonies were held in Ahmadiyya mosques across Canada. So, to hear Don Cherry’s divisive comments the next day was very disappointing. If he genuinely cared about supporting veterans, he would have simply said that more people should wear the poppy. Perhaps Don doesn’t realize that these “you-people” have also served and sacrificed their lives for Canada.</p>
      <p>With that said, no one should be forced to wear a poppy. Don, I do love “your” way of life, which includes freedom to express support. Everyone has a different experience with the military. Not wearing a poppy doesn’t make you less of a Canadian.</p>

      <h3>Speaking up for veterans</h3>
      <p>Is no one speaking up for Don Cherry? All he was asking was for people to honour our veterans. I am sure that immigrants who flee their war-torn countries to Canada do honour the soldiers who fight and die for our freedom.</p>

      <h3>Honouring through voting</h3>
      <p>For many years now Don Cherry has attempted to shame Canadians into wearing poppies.</p>
      <p>I choose to honour my family members from earlier generations who fought in war, and in some cases died in war, by doing the following: I vote. Their sacrifices have allowed me to live in one of the best democracies, and therefore I vote, even when it’s inconvenient, or time consuming, or even when I think my vote won’t count. I vote because to not do so would be to disrespect those who have served in the Armed Forces.</p>
