      <p>Today, Arjun Kapoor took to his social media handles and shared Mantra and Nawab Shah's first look posters. While Nawad portrays <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ibrahim-Khan-Gardi">Ibrahim Khan Gardi</a>, Mantra can be seen as Najib-Ud-Daula.</p>
      <p>Talking about the characters, Ibrahim, is a loyalist, he served Peshwa of the Maratha Empire and was captured and killed by the Afghan Pathans during the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Third-Battle-of-Panipat">Third Battle of Panipat</a> in 1761.
