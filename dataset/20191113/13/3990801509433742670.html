        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>In August, I wrote about <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/08/27/googles-nest-hub-is-the-perfect-smart-screen-for-my-kitchen/">the Google Nest Hub</a> as my top choice for a smart device in the kitchen. It has a good screen that’s just the perfect size, and nice loudspeakers.</p>
      <p>In September, Amazon announced its response to the Nest Hub – the Echo Show 8 smart display – which features an 8-inch HD screen.</p>
      <p>In September, as an answer to that, Amazon announced its Echo Show 8 smart device with an 8-inch HD screen. The device is set to be released on November 21 for $130. However, you can pre-order it now to get it for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=tnw88-20">just $100</a>.</p>
      <p>Apart from the screen with 1280 x 800 resolution, the device has dual-channel speakers with 10W output from each channel. It also has a front-facing camera so you can call your friends and family directly from the device.</p>
      <p>And of course, Alexa is always ready to answer your question, play your music, switch on the lights, or set an alarm. The 8-inch screen should also make it easy to see the answers to your questions, or watch short videos.</p>
      <p>If you’re worried about your privacy, the device has a handy switch that kills the mic and camera with a simple toggle.</p>
      <p>Don’t just stare at the screen. Pre-order the new Echo Show 8 now at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=tnw88-20">just $100</a> ($30 off).</p>
