      <p>NEW DELHI: Low cost <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/SpiceJet">SpiceJet</a> reported a loss of Rs 462.6 crore in this July-September quarter, up almost 19% from a loss of Rs 389.4 crore in Q2 last fiscal due to higher costs and continued grounding of the airline’s Boeing 737 Max since this March.</p>
      <p>In the first six months of this fiscal, the airline lost Rs 724.3 crore — almost Rs 4 crore daily. SpiceJet scrip closed 1.2% lower at Rs 113.7 on BSE on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The airline has initiated the process of seeking damages from Boeing which indicated a likely return to service of these planes next January.</p>
      <p>SpiceJet’s operating revenue in Q2 is Rs 2,845.3 crore, up almost 52% from Rs 1,874.8 crore in same quarter last fiscal. For the same comparative period, total expenses were Rs 3,536.1 crore as against Rs 2,291.5 crore.</p>
      <p>SpiceJet chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said: “With the industry’s growth rate slowing down in the past few months the impact is evident on the bottom line. We, however, remain optimistic that the sector will regain the lost momentum as the inherent demand remains very strong. The continued grounding of the B737 Max has hit our growth plans adversely and resulted in inefficient operations and as a result, increase in costs. Nevertheless, we have added 37 planes to our fleet in the past six months to ensure smooth operations and continued growth.”</p>
      <p>“The likely return to service of the 737 MAX early next year, and as indicated by Boeing recently, would mean that SpiceJet has at its disposal more than 25 brand new planes and we look forward to it. The return of the 737 MAX will provide a huge boost to our operations and we are confident that with the rigorous scrutiny, the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly,” Singh added.</p>
      <p>The airline said its Q2 loss of Rs 462.6 crore “includes a loss of Rs 180.3 crore on account of (new) accounting standard without which the loss is Rs 282.3 crore.” It currently has a fleet of 118 aircraft using which 630 daily flights are operated.</p>
