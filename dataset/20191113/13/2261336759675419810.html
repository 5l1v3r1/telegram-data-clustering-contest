      <p>YouTuber Logan Paul lost his rematch to KSI over the weekend. And after that seemingly unsuccessful boxing venture, he is now setting his sights on an MMA run.</p>
      <p>Paul caught up with TMZ recently where he expressed his intentions to fight former WWE superstar turned UFC welterweight CM Punk.</p>
      <p>“I am (open to fighting CM Punk),” he said (transcript by <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/logan-paul-says-he-would-destroy-cm-punk-in-mma-fight-open-to-boxing-fking-psy-dillon-danis/">BJPenn.com</a>). “I think I would destroy CM Punk if I’m being honest. I don’t know if anyone would disagree with that. He lost all (his UFC fights). I know I can take him.”</p>
      <p>For Paul, Punk is just his doorway into mixed martial arts, as he eventually intends to face someone “worthy.” But at the same time, he admits he isn’t ready to face elite competition just yet.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t about CM Punk anymore. I would want to fight an MMA fight,” he said. “I would want to fight in the UFC or Bellator. Why CM Punk? Anyone, just a worthy adversary. It can’t be a world-class fighter.”</p>
      <p>Paul has also been in conflict Bellator fighter Dillon Danis. Danis was even banned from attending the boxing match against KSI, after being labeled as a “<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20956565/bellator-fighter-dillon-danis-banned-from-attending-ksi-vs-logan-paul-2-boxing-youtube-championship">high risk</a>.”</p>
      <p>While admitting he would likely be schooled in an MMA fight versus Danis, Paul is certain it would be the other way around in a boxing match.</p>
      <p>“To be honest with you I’d fight Dillon any day. Dillon, you’re a f—ing p—sy,” he said. “You’re a lot of talk and no one in the MMA community likes you. You got a few Twitter followers who are on your d-ck and that’s it. I can assure you if you came over to the YouTube space we’d f—k you up, specifically me,”</p>
      <p>“I’d probably box the guy, his BJJ game is too good for me to try and roll with him,” Paul added. “But boxing bro? MMA guys, we sparred a lot of them training for KSI because of the wild punches.</p>
      <p>“I would love to box Dillon Danis. But do the fans want to see me box Dillon? Does Dillon put people in seats? Who the f—k is Dillon Danis? He’s Conor McGregor’s friend and he’s a punk-ass kid who chirps on Twitter. He’s got fat thumbs.”</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old Punk is 0-2 in the UFC. He last fought at UFC 225 in 2018, where he lost to Mike Jackson via decision.</p>
      <p>Danis, meanwhile, is 2-0 in MMA. He last fought in June at Bellator 222, where he won via first-round submission.</p>
