      <h1>Aldi Unveils New Halloumi Burger and Brings Back Halloumi Fries</h1>

      <p>Aldi is bringing back its halloumi fries from last year, alongside Christmas halloumi treats, and a new halloumi burger.</p>
      <p>Despite being suspiciously absent from the supermarket's website, last year's halloumi fries are making a comeback, and if you want to kick it up a notch, you can serve them with halloumi burgers for an insanely cheesy feast. Both the burgers and fries are priced at £2.29, which gets you a pack of four 'patties', or a box of 10 fries.</p>
      <p>Aldi's halloumi - the actual block of delightfully squeaky cheese - is only £1.49, and if even a kitchen cretin like me can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZRlomIhl1v/?igshid=hq9z1qsp8klb">whip up a batch of halloumi fries</a> you can too - something you might want to consider if Aldi implements its two packs per customer policy again because they were just far too tasty and ended up being snapped up like hotcakes apparently.</p>
      <p>If that's tickled your fancy, just wait until December 5 when Aldi's <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/halloumi-wrapped-in-bacon/p/021469322142000"><s>pigs</s> halloumi-in-blankets</a> go on sale.</p>

      <p>The supermarket hasn't announced the price of these festive nibbles yet, but you can always knock up your own version in the interim and see how they turn out. And don't forget the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/aldi-giant-pig-in-blanket-christmas/">giant pig-in-a-blanket</a> that also rolls out next month, giving you 6ft 5inches of bacon-wrapped sausage to feed the whole family. Or just you, depending on how hungry you are. [<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/aldis-halloumi-fries-are-back-and-theyre-launching-halloumi-burgers-too-11077717/">Metro</a>]</p>
