      <p>Adam Sandler’s college acting coach once told him to “choose another path”.</p>
      <p>The revelation comes from Brad Pitt in a new interview with two actors as part of <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/features/brad-pitt-adam-sandler-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-uncut-gems-1203400765/"><i>Variety</i></a>‘s Actors On Actors series.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“This is my favourite Adam Sandler story that I heard from [film director] Bennett Miller,” Pitt says during the interview.</p>
      <p>“It was that you were at NYU, and it was an acting coach, I believe. And he said to you, ‘I want to take you out for a beer.’ This is what I’m told. You guys went to a bar, and he kindly said to you: ‘Think about something else. You have to choose another path.’ Truth?”</p>
      <p>Sandler then confirmed that the incident was true, before Pitt continued with the story.</p>

      <p>“There’s a second part to this story. This is why it’s my favorite Adam Sandler story, and I think it says a lot about you. That you ran into him at your height, when you’re getting the ultimate payday, and you’re with a bunch of friends, out at a bar. Anyone would think that’s the opportunity where you rub it in his face.</p>
      <p>“And reportedly, what you did was you introduced him to your friends, and you said: ‘This is the only teacher to ever buy me a beer.’ True?”</p>
      <p>Once again, Sandler confirms that it did in fact happen.</p>
