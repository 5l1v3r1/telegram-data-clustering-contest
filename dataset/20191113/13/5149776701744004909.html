      <h1>'Individual quality' - How Nottingham Forest ace has stepped up in teammate's absence</h1>
      <h2>Reds legend Garry Birtles on how Joe Worrall has stepped up to the plate in recent weeks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:47:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:47</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>It will be great to have Michael Dawson back for Nottingham Forest, hopefully after the international break.</p>
      <p>I can understand Sabri Lamouchi <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sabri-lamouchi-reveals-michael-dawson-3520798">not wanting to risk him</a> against Derby County, though.</p>
      <p>Dawson has been missed. We all know what he brings and what he can do.</p>
      <p>But I think <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joe-worrall">Joe Worrall</a> deserves a lot of credit for really showing what he is capable of this season.</p>
      <p>Him and Dawson had established a really good partnership; they worked very well together and were superb earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>But equally, I think you’ve got to give Worrall praise on his own. We’ve seen <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/revelation-outstanding-more-come-how-3532587">his individual quality</a> while Michael has been out injured.</p>
      <p>It would have been easy for him to drop off a bit without Dawson alongside him, but instead he’s really stepped up to the plate.</p>
      <p>He’s played a big part over the last few weeks.</p>

      <p>Worrall seems to have <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-defender-joe-worrall-3290617">benefitted from that loan spell at Rangers</a> last season, which is good to see.</p>
      <p>I’ve always said I much prefer players to go out and get game time on loan if they need to. It’s better than being sat on your backside.</p>
      <p>Go somewhere and get your chance - that’s the beauty of loan spells.</p>
      <p>Going on loan can really work in your favour, as it seems to have done with Worrall.</p>
      <p>Chema and Tobias Figueiredo have done well alongside him, but it will still be good to have Dawson back.</p>
      <p>Even while he’s not been playing, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/michael-dawson">Dawson</a> will still have been a big influence off the pitch, though.</p>
      <p>He’ll still have been making his voice heard, I’m sure. He’ll have made sure he’s still part of what’s going on.</p>
      <p>I’m sure Lamouchi realises how he can play a part like that. The players respect Dawson; they respect his attitude and the way he goes about things.</p>
      <p>It will be a big boost to have him back soon. The more fit players you have in the squad, the better.</p>
