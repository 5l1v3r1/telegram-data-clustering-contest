      <p>You don't have to be a <i>Shenmue </i>die-hard to appreciate the <i>Shenmue III</i> launch trailer.</p>
      <p>There's just something so magical about a long-dormant series springing back to life out of the blue, especially after years of near-misses and wishful thinking. This might not be your jam, but there's a universal joy here, even from the sidelines. The first few notes in the trailer are spine-tingling.</p>
      <p>It's been an arduous road leading up to <i>Shenmue III</i>'s announcement, to say nothing of its funding, production, delays, store drama, and now-fast-approaching release on <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/shenmue-3/home">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shenmue-iii-ps4/">PlayStation 4</a>. Can you believe we're less than a week out from an honest-to-goodness Yu Suzuki game? It's finally real!</p>
      <p>There are countless launch trailers every day, but this one feels justified. It's momentous.</p>
