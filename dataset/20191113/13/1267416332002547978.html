      <h1>Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro is now available in Canada</h1>
      <h2>The rumours regarding the move to a scissor switch keyboard were true</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:30:03+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/patrickorourke" target="_blank">Patrick O'Rourke</a></address>
      <p>After what <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/30/apple-scissor-keyboard-macbook-pro-mid-2020-report/">feels like endless rumour</a>s, Apple has officially launched the subtly redesigned <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/13/apple-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-scissor-switch-hands-on/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with a redesigned keyboard that features scissor switches, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro includes a physical ‘Escape’ key, minimized bezels as well as audio and thermal improvements. It’s unclear when Apple plans to bring these often-requested design changes to the rest of the MacBook lineup.</p>
      <p>Despite several attempts to fix the ‘Butterfly’ keyboard’s concerns, Apple never <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/06/25/apple-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-replacement-program/">solved its reliability issues</a>. It seems the company has plans to eventually ditch the design altogether, though for the time being, the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/07/26/apple-2018-macbook-pro/">13-inch MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/11/16/macbook-air-2018-review/">MacBook Air</a> still feature Apple’s third-generation Butterfly mechanism</p>
      <p>Other changes include reducing the 15-inch MacBook Pro’s bezels by 25 percent on the top and 34 percent on the side, resulting in this new 16-inch model.</p>
      <p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro features Intel’s latest hexa-core Core i7 and octa-core i9 processors with Turbo Boost speeds of up to 5.0GHz, resulting in what Apple says is performance faster than the highest-end quad-core 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>Regarding graphics cards, the laptop features AMD’s Radeon Pro 5000M series with a configuration that allows for up to 8GB of VRAM. There are also new 64GB DDR4 and 8TB storage options. Apple claims that the new 16-inch Pro is the only laptop to offer an internal 8TB storage option, a first for a laptop.</p>

      <p>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,999 CAD and is available now on <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca">apple.com. </a>The Cupertino, California-based company says the new laptop will be available in Apple Stores later this week.</p>
