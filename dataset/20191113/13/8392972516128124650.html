      <p>Roy Cropper will finally meet his long-lost brother tonight, in an emotional <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> storyline, which is set to leave the cafe owner shaken to the core.</p>
      <p>On Monday (November 11), the fan favourite revealed he had a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-roy-finds-his-long-lost-brother/">secret younger half-brother called Richard Lucas</a>, the product of an affair his late mum Sylvia had decades ago.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He explained how the love child was put up for adoption, so as to ensure the family scandal was swiftly buried.</p>
      <p>After some convincing from Carla, Roy agreed to go looking for his estranged sibling and the pair headed towards the address Roy believed was where his relative lived.</p>
      <p>However, when they got there, Richard's daughter Nina fobbed Roy off, denying she knew anyone with that name...</p>

      </p>
      <p>Fans were shocked, however, as Richard was later seen in the flat.</p>
      <p>And some recognised the actor from his previous role in an 80s sitcom.</p>
      <aside>Watching, he was Malcolm, his real name is Paul Bown.</aside>
      <p>Writing on Coronation Street ITV Facebook fan page, one wrote: "Apologies if this has already been asked, but could anyone tell me what sitcom Roy's brother was in?</p>
      <p>"I think it was in the 80s or 90s... Thanks in advance."</p>

      <p>Many replied with the information that it was, in fact, Watching - which also starred Liza Tarbuck and Emma Wray.</p>
      <p>One confirmed: "Watching, he was Malcolm, his real name is Paul Bown."</p>
      <p>Another added: "He was Mrs Cakeworthy's husband Colin in Green Green Grass."</p>
      <p>A third typed: "If you watched the recent serial drama A Confession, he had a small part in that. I spent about two hours racking my brain as to what he was in, then remembered he played a birdwatcher in Watching. He looks so different now."</p>

      <p>Jobbing actor Paul, 62, is probably still <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-casts-paul-bown-as-roy-croppers-long-lost-brother/">best known as fresh-faced romantic Malcolm in popular ITV sitcom Watching, which ran from 1987 to 1993</a>.</p>
      <p>More recently he appeared in an episode of ITV's true life drama serial <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/john-godden-itvs-a-confession-ruined-my-life/">A Confession</a>, playing a former cellmate of serial killer Christopher Halliwell.</p>
      <p>Over the years, he's also starred in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/drama-tv/holby-city/">Holby City</a>, Doctors, Endeavour, New Tricks, Father Brown, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/drama-tv/casualty/">Casualty</a> and The Bill.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday (November 13), the brothers are eventually reunited when the cafe owner reveals the full family backstory.</p>

      <p>Sadly, it's tinged with tragedy as Roy discovers Richard is seriously ill with pulmonary fibrosis.</p>
      <p>Spoilers suggest that Richard's goth daughter Nina, played by newcomer Mollie Gallagher, could well be <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-roy-cropper-to-move-in-with-teen-goth/">sticking around once her dad dies</a>.</p>
