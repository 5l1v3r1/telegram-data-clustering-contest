      <p>James Morrison has been dipping his toe in and out of the music scene since he won a Brit Award in 2007 for Best British Male, but last night at the Royal Concert Hall he showed that he is definitely back with a vengeance.</p>
      <p>With a new album to promote, You’re Stronger Than You Know, he delivered a set list that included some of his classics as well as new songs that he wrote during a period of turbulence in both his personal and professional life.</p>

      <p>With a very talented band and two superb backing singers, he strolled out onto the stage, strapped on his guitar and launched into his opening number Under The Influence, which he followed up with Nothing Ever Hurt Like You.</p>
      <p>New songs Cross The Line and I Still Need You demanded the crowd’s attention, which they duly gave. As he delivered an excellent stripped back Feels Like The First Time, he had them all on side.</p>

      <p>Morrison was likeable and chatty and very much at home with this audience. Getting the concert going with Undiscovered, its gospel tones soared around the auditorium.</p>
      <p>As well as past hits You Give Me Something, Broken Strings and I Won’t Let You Go, his soulful voice was put into full effect for his version of The Beatles’ classic With A Little Help From My Friends.</p>

      <p>New songs Power and Glorious had that classic Morrison sound - guitar-led with strong backing vocals and a sing-a-long chorus = plus emotionally charged lyrics.</p>
      <p>When he unleashed the hits You Make It Real and Wonderful World to bring the evening to an end, the crowd couldn’t get enough of him.</p>
      <p>He waved and strolled off stage - just as he had arrived - with no fuss.</p>
