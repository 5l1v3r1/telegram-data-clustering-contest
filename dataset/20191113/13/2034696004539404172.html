      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/camila-cabello">Camila Cabello</a> has confirmed details of her second album ‘Sophomore’, which will arrive next month.</p>
      <p>The second album from the ‘Havana’ singer will arrive on December 6, and she’ll release ‘Living Proof’, the latest track from the album this Friday.</p>
      <p>“I wanted this album to sound like what falling in love feels like, pretty impossible thing to do but I can say I gave it all I had,” Cabello wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never lived as much life as I did writing this album. It was messy and beautiful, unforgettable and at times so painful I wish I could forget. It was excruciatingly consuming and impossible not to get lost in. It was mine… and now it’s yours. I hope you love it as much as I’ve loved living it.”</p>

      <p>The complete track listing is yet to be released.</p>
      <p>In September, Capello teased that new music<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/camila-cabello-teases-new-music-2544053"> was on the way in a new video to fans.</a></p>
      <p>“I’ve learned a lot about love in my 20s, but not enough to maintain any control in the face of its power,” Cabello said in the video. “And for every new thing I learned, there was something else I couldn’t understand.”</p>
      <p>“I thought I was making art before,” she continued. “Writing songs was me making art but now I want my life to be a work of art, and my songwriting to be the camera that I take a picture of it with.”</p>
