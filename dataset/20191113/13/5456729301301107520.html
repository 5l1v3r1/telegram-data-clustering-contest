      <p>A housewife, Fatima Ishaq, on Wednesday in Kaduna dragged her husband, Hassan Haruna, before a Sharia Court in Kaduna, over his being accused of raping a minor.</p>
      <p>The petitioner who lives with her estranged husband within Kaduna metropolis, through her counsel, M.S. Abdullahi, told the court that she cannot continue living with Mr Haruna.</p>
      <p>Mr Abdullahi said that his client could no longer guarantee her respect for Mr Haruna.</p>
      <p>He told the court that his client was willing to pay back the N5,000 her husband paid as bride price in 2006.</p>
      <p>The petitioner is seeking the custody of their four children and N20,000 monthly for their upkeep.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the respondent was brought to the court in shackles for allegedly raping a minor.</p>
      <p>Mr Haruna, however, denied the charge of rape against him.</p>
      <p>“If it is because of the rape issue you want to leave me, I can swear with the Holy Quran that I am innocent even though I will oblige your divorce request,” he said.</p>
      <p>The judge, Dahiru Lawal, terminated the marriage and ordered the petitioner to return N15,000 to Mr Haruna as the bride price he paid.</p>
      <p>“The value of money in 2006 is not the same in the current situation,” Mr Lawal said.</p>
