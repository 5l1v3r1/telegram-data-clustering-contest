      <p>It seems like <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> is planning to release yet another camera-centric smartphone. As most of you probably already know, the Mi CC9 Pro aka Mi Note 10 can be referred to as a camera-centric smartphone.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi included five cameras on the back of this phone. The device comes with a 108-megapixel main camera, and a separate camera for telephoto, ultrawide, and macro shots. It actually includes two telephoto units, and two dual-LED flash sensors.</p>
      <p>The Mi CC9 Pro / Mi Note 10 managed to hit a really high score on DxOMark. The device scored 121 overall, and it matches the Mate 30 Pro in that regard.</p>

      <h3>Xiaomi may already be planning to release a new camera-centric smartphone</h3>
      <p>This phone may not retain the status of Xiaomi's best camera smartphone. If a <a href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/IfH2jkcZG">Chinese tipster</a> is to be believed, Xiaomi is preparing something else for us, soon. That device will, allegedly, trump the Mi CC9 Pro / Mi Note 10 in the camera department.</p>
      <p>More info regarding the device will be revealed during Xiaomi's AIoT event which is supposed to occur in the near future. This information was published by the tipster's official account on Weibo, but take it with a grain of salt.</p>
      <p>It is also rumored that Xiaomi is once again partnering with Samsung. As a reminder, that Bright HMX sensor that is included in the Mi Note 10 is actually an ISOCELL sensor. A camera sensor that was developed by both Samsung and Xiaomi.</p>

      <p>If we had to guess, we'd say that the phone will include a new 108-megapixel sensor. Samsung is rumored to be working on a new 108-megapixel camera sensor for the Galaxy S11, and Xiaomi may get a chance to use it as well.</p>
      <p>If that ends up being the case, Xiaomi's device will probably be released after the Galaxy S11. The Galaxy S11 is expected to arrive in February next year, soâ€¦ Xiaomi's unit will probably have to wait until then. Chances are it will arrive in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Some people already started assuming that the device in question is the Redmi K30. Well, that is possible, as that phone is expected to arrive in May next year. That may not be accurate, though.</p>

      <h3>The Xiaomi Mi 10 may include a new 108-megapixel camera</h3>
      <p>Redmi is now a separate company, technically, so the Mi 10 may be the first phone to offer that new 108-megapixel sensor. The Xiaomi Mi 10 is expected to arrive before the Redmi K30, so we'd bet that that phone will utilize such a large camera sensor.</p>
      <p>We're only guessing here, of course. The source did not really give us a lot of material to work with, so we have to try to make some assumptions.</p>
      <p>It is always possible that Xiaomi is planning something else entirely. The company tends to release quite a few devices on a yearly basis, so who knows what it's planning for 2020.</p>
