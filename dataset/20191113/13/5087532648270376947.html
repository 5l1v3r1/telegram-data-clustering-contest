      <p>Richard Plebler, former CEO of HBO who departed the company back in February is headed to Apple (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbo-ceo-richard-plepler-heading-apple-1254242">via</a> <i>Hollywood Reporter</i>).</p>
      <h3>Richard Plepler</h3>
      <p>He’s reportedly in advanced discussions to sign an exclusive production deal with Apple TV+ and it’s expected to close by the end of the year. Once it does close his company RLP &amp; Co. will create original content for Apple.</p>
      <blockquote>Sources say Apple TV+ heads of worldwide video Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht are leading the charge to secure a production deal with Plepler, who has a long roster of ties to the industry’s most sought-after creators and stars alike. Plepler would be the latest high-profile production deal the duo made at Apple and join a roster that also includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, A24, Sesame Workshop and the parent company of Peanuts.</blockquote>
