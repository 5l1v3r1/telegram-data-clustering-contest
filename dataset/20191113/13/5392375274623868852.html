      <p>Samsung already working on Android 10 for the Galaxy M20 and M30<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Several months ago, Samsung officially presented the Samsung Galaxy M20. This device was the first to reach this new series of mid-low range of the company. It did it with a number of very interesting features and today is still an option for many users thanks to its price drop. Today, we have very good news for all users who opted for this phone or who later bought a Galaxy M30. Both devices are being tested with Android 10, so their update could arrive earlier than expected.</p>
      <p>Samsung has greatly improved its support for updates in the last year, although we cannot say that it treats the mid-range or low-end devices much better. Today we can announce that the company is trying to improve support for its more modest devices. We could see updates that do not take 10 to 12 months to arrive.</p>
      <h3>The Galaxy M20 and M30 have been certified with Android 10</h3>
      <p>Wi-Fi Alliance has certified the Galaxy M20 and the Galaxy M30 with Android 10. This is great news, as it means that Samsung is working on the update for both devices. It is news that we did not expect to see in 2019, not even at the beginning of 2020. The hope for these phones is to upgrade to Android 10 at some point in the summer of 2020, but it seems that the update could come earlier.</p>

      <p>Users should have something clear when they buy a mid-range from <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a>. Android updates can take many months to arrive. This year with Android 10 the thing could change. Because on November 13, 2019, the M20 and M30 have been hunted with the new operating system. In addition, <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-starts-android-10-development-for-the-galaxy-m20-and-m30/">SamMobile</a> confirms that Samsung is already working on Android 10 for these two devices.</p>
      <p>Currently, no Samsung mobile has Android 10 officially and stably. But the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 will start receiving this OS very soon. It is curious that the second phones that could receive Android 10 are the most modest devices in the M range and not the Galaxy A50, for example.</p>
      <p>At this time we cannot confirm when these devices will be updated. But the reality is that the whole process is being carried out much earlier than expected. Maybe not in 2019, but in early 2020 the Samsung Galaxy M20 and M30 could be updated to Android 10 in an official and stable way.</p>
