      <p>Apple has today unveiled the first redesign of the MacBook Pro line since the switch to the Touch Bar and USB-C ports three years ago.<br/><br/><b>Must read: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/volta-xl-a-cable-that-can-stop-you-destroying-your-precious-macbook/"><b>Volta XL: A cable that can stop you destroying your precious MacBook</b></a><br/><br/>One of the biggest -- but perhaps not the most obvious -- difference with the new <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/the-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-gets-a-bigger-screen-and-a-brand-new-keyboard/">MacBook Pro is the switch to a bigger 16-inch display</a>. The larger screen size is likely aimed at content creators who like the mobility of the MacBook Pro platform, but who also value every pixel of screen real estate they can get their eyes on.</p>

      <p>The new 16-inch MacBook Pro also features an updated keyboard, as Apple tries to work the kinks out of the <a href="http://zdnet.com/article/is-apple-finally-ditching-macbooks-problem-butterfly-keyboard/">flawed butterfly mechanism</a> it has been <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-offers-free-keyboard-replacement-program-for-macbook-macbook-pro-refreshes-macbook-pro-lineup/">pushing for the past four years</a>. Apple finally admits defeat and throws out the butterfly mechanism and returns to a scissor mechanism for what it is calling a Magic Keyboard. The keys on the 16-inch MacBook Pro are wider than those found on the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro, and feature more key travel. The key caps are now also removable, and it seems that Apple has put effort into making the keyboard more repairable.<br/><br/>In another throwback, the keyboard now features a physical ESC key that sits along with the Touch Bar (yes, the new MacBook Pro retains the Touch Bar).</p>
      <p>The new laptop also features a louder speaker. Oh, and the headphone jack lives to survive another MacBook Pro refresh.<br/><br/>The battery has been beefed up to 100 watt-hour, and Apple claims that this gives it an 11-hour battery life, a whole hour more than the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro it replaces.</p>
      <p>The base 256GB SSD has been bumped up to 512GB (and can be taken all the way to 8TB, a first for a notebook), and the AMD Radeon Pro 555X GPU has been upgraded to Radeon Pro 5300M and 5500M silicon. However, the starting price of $2,399 is unchanged from the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro.<br/><br/>Apple has also worked on cooling to allow the system to run at higher power for sustained periods of time. The improvements include a new fan design with a larger impeller with extended blades along with bigger vents, which results in a 28% increase in airflow, and a 35% larger heatsink to allow for greater heat dissipation. According to Apple, these changes allow the 16-inch MacBook Pro to "sustain up to 12 more watts during intensive workloads than the previous design."</p>
