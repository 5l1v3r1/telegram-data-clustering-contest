      <h1>Air pollution shuts schools in Iran's capital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:11:41+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>TEHRAN: </b>Schools in Tehran were ordered to be closed on Wednesday after the Iranian capital was cloaked in dangerously high levels of air pollution, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Governor Anoushiravan Mohseni-Bandpey said kindergartens, preschools and primary schools would be shut in the city and the counties of Gharchak, Pishva and Varamin.</p>
      <p>“The air quality index for the city of Tehran still has not passed the unhealthy status for sensitive groups,” he was quoted as saying by state news agency <i>IRNA.</i></p>
      <p>Average concentrations of hazardous airborne particles hit 133 micrograms per cubic metre in the city and were as high as 150 for 10 districts, he said.</p>
      <p>That is far above the World Health Organisation’s recommended maximum of 25 micrograms per cubic metre on average over a 24-hour period.</p>

      <p>Warnings were issued for children, pregnant women, the elderly and people suffering from cardio-vascular or respiratory diseases to stay indoors.</p>
      <p>Many people were seen wearing face masks to avoid fumes as they waited for buses on the sides of traffic-choked streets of southern Tehran during morning rush-hour.</p>
      <p>A layer of thick smog covered Tehran on Tuesday, but it appeared to dissipate in northern areas on Wednesday morning with fewer school buses on the roads.</p>
      <p>Air pollution was the cause of nearly 30,000 deaths per year in Iranian cities, <i>IRNA</i> reported earlier this year, citing a health ministry official.</p>
      <p>Each winter, Iran’s sprawling capital suffers some of the worst pollution in the world through thermal inversion — a phenomenon that traps hazardous air over the city.</p>
      <p>According to a World Bank report last year, most of the pollution in the city of eight million inhabitants is caused by heavy duty vehicles, motorbikes, refineries and power plants.</p>
