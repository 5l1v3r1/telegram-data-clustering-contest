      <h1>Google fires staffer, suspends two others, amid rising workplace tensions</h1>
      <h2>Workplace political battles are steadily eroding Google’s open culture.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:38:33+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Timothy B. Lee</a></address>
      <p>Google has fired a staffer who allegedly leaked the names of Google employees and their personal details to the news media, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/one-google-staffer-fired-two-others-put-on-leave-amid-tensions">Ryan Gallagher reports</a> in a scoop for Bloomberg News. Two other Googlers have been put on leave for violating company policies, Google told Gallagher.</p>
      <p>A Google spokeswoman told Gallagher that one of the employees "had searched for and shared confidential documents outside the scope of their job, while the other tracked the individual calendars of staff working in the community platforms, human resources, and communications teams." The tracking made affected staff uncomfortable, the spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Google's move represents the latest sign of growing tensions between labor and management at Google. Until recently, Google was known for having one of Silicon Valley's most open workplace cultures. Employees could access information about projects they weren't working on. Rank-and-file employees could ask tough questions of senior management at weekly "TGIF" meetings that were broadcast throughout the company.</p>
      <p>But that open culture has begun to break down as the polarization of the broader American political culture has seeped into Google's workplace. Two years ago, for example, Google engineer James Damore <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/google-fires-engineer-who-crossed-the-line-with-diversity-memo/">wrote a controversial memo</a> suggesting that biological differences could help explain the gender gap among engineers at Google. The memo leaked, and Damore was fired.</p>
      <p>Last year, a Googler <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/google-cofounder-called-trumps-election-deeply-offensive-in-leaked-video/">leaked a video</a> of a TGIF held shortly after the 2016 election, in which senior Google executives expressed dismay about the election of Donald Trump. Not long after that, thousands of employees around the world <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/google-offices-from-mountain-view-to-atlanta-protest-sexual-misconduct/">walked out of their offices</a> to protest Google's handling of sexual harassment issues. Google also faced employee pressure to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/google-employees-demand-that-google-stop-work-on-censored-chinese-search/">cancel plans</a> for a censored Chinese search engine and to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/google-reportedly-wont-renew-controversial-drone-imaging-program/">stop working</a> on a military contract relating to drones.</p>
      <p>Google management has responded by restricting employee access to sensitive documents. And in August, Google <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/google-bans-political-discussion-on-internal-mailing-lists.html">announced new rules</a> restricting political discussions on internal mailing lists.</p>
      <p>On internal discussion forums, some employees expressed dismay at the evolution of Google's corporate culture.</p>
      <p>“As a company we’ve prided ourselves on transparency and information-sharing,” wrote an employee in a post leaked to Bloomberg. "One of the big benefits of Google is that you can see what everyone else is working on, and how it all fits together. But I guess we’ve abandoned that now. And that both disappoints and terrifies me.”</p>
      <p>But Google's management may not have had a good alternative. Some of the rancor inside Google pits labor against management. But other controversies have pitted workers against one another over hot-button issues like race, gender, and partisan politics. Googlers were not only attacking each other on internal forums, some were leaking the details of these disputes publicly, often embarrassing Google in the process.</p>
      <p>And so Google is increasingly becoming like a normal company—one where most employees are given information only on a need-to-know basis, and employees are discouraged from discussing politics on the job.</p>
