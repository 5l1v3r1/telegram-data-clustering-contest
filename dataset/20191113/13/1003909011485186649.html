      <h1>Atco Blue Flame Kitchen: 3 Easy Weeknight Pasta Meals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:00:03+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen</a></address>
      <p>A perennial crowd pleaser, most families have a pasta recipe or two in their repertoire. Here are three of our favourites for a quick and hearty weeknight meal.</p>
      <p>Our Simple Tomato Pasta is almost as easy as buying a jar of premade sauce and just as flavourful. Enjoy as is, or add ground meat, vegetables, herbs, and/or spices for a dish that is uniquely your own.</p>
      <p>Our Tomato Chili Rosé Pasta features a creamy sauce made with fresh grape tomatoes, ground chicken, baby spinach, red pepper flakes, and Parmesan cheese. Fat-free sour cream adds richness to the dish without being too heavy. The ruffled edges of Mafalda pasta, which resembles lasagna, but skinnier, are perfect for picking up the delicious sauce, but if you can’t find it at your grocery store, any short pasta will do.</p>
      <p>Most gratin recipes require making a béchamel sauce, adding time and dishes to the cooking process. Our Four Cheese Pasta Gratin uses canned cheddar cheese soup as the base, alongside Monterey Jack, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese, making this decadent meal foolproof.</p>
