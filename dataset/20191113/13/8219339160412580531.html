      <p>Apple today <a href="https://amzn.to/2q3dZMM">announced the new high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> which replaces the existing 15-inch lineup. The new MacBook Pro heralds the return of scissor switch keyboard with a ‘Magic Keyboard’, a six-speaker system, up to 8-core processor, and up to 64 GB RAM.</p>
      <p>The new keyboard brings back a physical Escape key and 1mm of key travel. You can configure the new MacBook Pro with up to 8 TB of SSD storage. The new MacBook Pro is available today, starting at $2399.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Apple VP Tom Boger described the new MacBook Pro as featuring a “larger display, blazing-fast performance, the biggest battery possible, the best notebook keyboard ever, awesome speakers and massive amounts of storage”.</p>
      <p>The new 16-inch screen features a resolution of 3072×1920 which means it is higher density panel at 226 pixels-per-inch.</p>
      <p>The new Magic Keyboard offers a physical Escape key, an inverted T arrow key arrangement along with the Touch Bar. Apple says the new keyboard features an Apple-designed rubber dome, with 1mm of travel and a stable feel. Obviously, many customers are glad to say goodbye to the uncomfortable/unreliable butterfly keyboard design.</p>

      <p>Apple says it has improved the thermal performance of the new laptop which helps sustain CPU and GPU running at full speed for longer. The new models feature 6- and 8-core CPUs and up to 64 GB RAM. The new baseline GPUs offer up to 2.1 times faster graphics performance than the previous standard configuration.</p>
      <p>Apple is claiming the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is the first notebook in the world to offer an 8 TB option for internal storage. As standard, the new MacBook Pro comes with 512 GB SSD — double the previous generation.</p>
      <p>The new MacBook Pro chassis also houses a new speaker design “to bring musicians, podcasters and video editors the most advanced audio experience ever”.</p>
      <p>You can order the new MacBook Pro today from the Apple Online Store. It will be in stores later this week.</p>
