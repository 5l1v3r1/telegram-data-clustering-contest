      <p>ICY is amazing</p>
      <p>original post: <a href="https://pann.nate.com/talk/348255173">pann</a></p>
      <p>1. [+90, -4] I read a post that talked about ‘ICY’ and TWICE flopping hardㅋㅋㅋ JYP girl groups are so popular and there are a lot of anticipations for their digital sales. But they get hate for no reason.</p>
      <p>2. [+71, -6] DALLA DALLA is so good, I still listen to it these days</p>
      <p>3. [+66, -3] ITZY should win the rookie of the year award</p>
      <p>4. [+46, -3] I personally find ‘Feel Special’ to be the best song of TWICE. The song really classy.</p>
      <p>5. [+39, -1] The antis kept saying that TWICE was flopping but they did well digitally on the charts full of ballad songs and their physical sales were big, too. What flop?ㅜㅜ</p>
      <p>6. [+34, -19] I was the only one who was boycotting BLACKPINK?</p>
      <p>7. [+32, -1] All those groups are amazing and their songs are good, stop trolling</p>
      <p>8. [+30, -16] On the current top 100 of Melon chart, DALLA DALLA , Fancy, ICY and Feel Special are the only girl group songs there. JYP girl groups are amazing.</p>
      <p>9. [+29, -1] JYP girl groups are the best</p>
      <p>10. [+27, -10] BLACKPINK was the real flop but people were bashing JYP girl groups.</p>
      <p>11. [+19, -0] JYP girl groups’ popularity is huge.</p>
      <p>12. [+15, -2] Mamamoo from a small agency but it seems they’re really doing well … amazing</p>
