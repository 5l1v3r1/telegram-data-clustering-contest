      <h1>Undeclared Viagra ingredient triggers libido-boosting supplement recall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:59:07+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">Madeline Farber</a></address>
      <p>A dietary supplement intended to boost libido in both men and women is facing a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/product-recalls">recall</a> because the product contains an ingredient found in Viagra, a popular erectile dysfunction medication.</p>
      <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) late last week announced the recall of Med Man’s Up2 Dietary supplement because the product is contaminated with sildenafil, an “FDA-approved prescription drug for erectile dysfunction,” according to a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/med-man-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-up2-due-presence-undeclared-sildenafil">news release on the recall. </a></p>

      <p>“The presence of sildenafil in Up2 products renders them unapproved drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established, therefore subject to recall,” the FDA continued.</p>

      <p>Sildenafil has the ability to react with nitrates in some prescription drugs, namely nitroglycerin. This reaction may cause the user’s blood pressure to drop to dangerous, life-threatening levels, the FDA said. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or heart disease often take nitrates and are most at risk in this instance. </p>
