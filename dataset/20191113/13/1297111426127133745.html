      <h1>Regina Pats eager to get 'back in the saddle'</h1>
      <h2>The Regina Pats have six days off before they return to action on Saturday at the Brandt Centre versus the Prince Albert Raiders.</h2>

      <p>Practise doesn’t necessarily make perfect for the Regina Pats.</p>
      <p>Although the WHL club is trying to take advantage of a break in its schedule, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-drop-back-and-forth-affair-in-winnipeg">the Pats would rather play their way into a rhythm after a recent string of tight losses</a>.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of guys who don’t have as many games under their belt in the WHL; nothing replicates the reps they get and the intensity at that level,” said Pats assistant coach Brad Herauf, whose club is idle until Saturday’s home date with the Prince Albert Raiders.</p>
      <p>“(The time off) allowed us to do some tinkering within our systems in practice, but a lot of times guys get better by doing that stuff in games. There are goods and bads but I personally like playing more games. Sometimes it’s nice to get back in the saddle.”</p>
      <p>Regina is in the midst of a soft spot in its schedule that includes just four games in 27 days. It should have been five games, but <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/fridays-pats-broncos-game-postponed-due-to-ice-plant-issue">Friday’s contest against the Swift Current Broncos was postponed because of an ice issue at the Brandt Centre</a>.</p>
      <p>This period of inactivity is especially tough on the players who reside near the bottom of the depth chart.</p>
      <p>“It affects those guys the most,” said Herauf, who’s running practice this week while Dave Struch is with Team WHL for the Canada Russia Series (Wednesday in Saskatoon and Thursday in Prince Albert).</p>
      <p>“We have eight defencemen right now and, for a couple of those young guys, it’s kind of a numbers game. If we’re playing a game or two during the week, the rotational guys are getting more reps. Guys are getting in the lineup more often versus sitting out for sometimes almost 10, 12 days in between games. That’s kind of the nature of being a 13<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup> forward or a seventh, eighth defenceman. It’s hardest on them.”</p>
      <p>Despite some scheduling challenges, the Pats believe they’ve made strides in recent games. They’ve picked up four points in their past five contests following a 10-game losing skid.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been happy with our game for the most part,” Herauf said. “Our breakdowns (have been costly). Goaltending has cost us some games. Some execution in our play without the puck has cost us some games. It’s just (about) getting better all the way around.”</p>
      <p>There remains a fine line between winning and losing for the Pats (2-12-2-0), who’ve had five of their past six losses decided by a single goal. The club’s lack of firepower is especially evident in those tight games.</p>
      <p>“Other teams have a bigger margin for error when you have goal scorers who can score you out of problems,” Herauf noted. “When we had Adam Brooks and Sam Steel, there were a lot of times where we would be furious with the way we played, but we won the game. A lot of times now it has been the opposite.”</p>
      <p>In time, the Pats believe their performance will be reflected in the outcome. It’s all part of the rebuilding process.</p>
      <p>“We’re continuing to strive to get better,” Herauf added. “If we can get that consistent effort, we’ll be happy as coaches. For the most part since the start of the year we’ve scored the first goal more times than not. We’re prepared. We come out ready to play. Our starts haven’t been the problem. It has been our finish and our ability to maintain that level of execution throughout the 60 minutes.”</p>
