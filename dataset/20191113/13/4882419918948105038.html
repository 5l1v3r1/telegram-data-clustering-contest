      <p>Barcelona don't plan on making any big moves in the short-term. Instead, they expect to move three players on in January but not sign anyone.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde feels the squad is well compensated and there will not be any incomings save any serious injuries between now and the winter window opening. Barça did make signings last January but none of the loans they brought in worked.</p>
      <p>There's interest in many Barça players and the club hope to move some on. There are already firm offers for Moussa Wague and Carles Aleña.</p>
      <p>Aleña looks set to go on loan without an option to buy. Real Betis, Granada, Getafe and Celta Vigo, as well as several Italian teams, have all asked. Barça prefer a project in Spain and Celta is his most likely destination at the moment.</p>
      <p>Wague's case isn't as clear. Valverde wanted him in the first team this season as the backup right-back but he hasn't had a single chance in an official match. It's likely he plays in the Copa and the club will look to loan him or sell him with a buyback option. He has options across Europe.</p>
      <p>The main operation, though, involves Ivan Rakitic. He's clear that he needs to play more and has accepted he will probably have to leave in January.</p>
      <p>Rakitic has offers from the Premier League, but his preference would be to stay in Spain, or to go to Italy, where there is plenty of interest, too.</p>
