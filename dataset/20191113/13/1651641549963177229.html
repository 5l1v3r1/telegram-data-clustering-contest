      <p>British actor Rahul Kohli has joined a host of video game streamers in the move to Microsoft Mixer.</p>
      <p>Joining the likes of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ninja-has-already-hit-1000000-active-subscribers-on-microsofts-mixer-platform/">Ninja</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/another-twitch-star-moves-to-microsoft-mixer/">Shroud</a> and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/king-gothalion-is-also-making-the-switch-from-twitch-to-mixer/">King Gothalion</a>, Kohli has launched his very own Mixer channel. The actor, <a href="https://twitter.com/RahulKohli13/status/1194517037239783424?s=20">who has expressed his wish to be referred to as Supergirl Guest Actor Rahul Kohli</a>, started his Mixer career with a stream of Star Wars Battlefront 2.</p>
      <p>Kohli’s Mixer channel is Star Wars focused at the moment. The channel description currently reads: “That really unknown actor who decided to exclusively play and stream as many LucasArt’s Star Wars titles as possible.” You’re not that unknown, man. We’ve seen you on Funhaus.</p>

      <p>Kohli isn’t just a guest star for Supergirl, although that is undoubtedly where most people will know him from. The actor is also known for his role as Ravi Chakrabarti in iZombie and Manager in EastEnders.</p>
      <p>In the world of video games, the actor has pulled some impressive performances in the past year. With his first video game appearance as Garcia the Gregarious in Avalanche’s Rage 2 and his second apparence as <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/review-gears-5-best-campaign/">Gears 5</a>‘s entertaining Fahz Chutani, Kohli <i>could</i> be the next Nolan North. <i>Could be.</i></p>
