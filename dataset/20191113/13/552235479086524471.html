      <p>A talented East Kilbride care worker has been impressing experts with her amazing baking.</p>
      <p>Anna Dillon from Drumsagard, Cambuslang bakes extraordinary cakes. She is currently a home-carer in East Kilbride.</p>
      <p>Anna started baking around five years ago when she still owned a snack van.</p>

      <p>She said: “It started with just tray bakes and such, but then people asked me to make birthday cakes. It was just basic ones to start with but I started to move on to extreme cakes and I really enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve baked so many cakes now and make them look as good as I can.”</p>
      <p>Anna has put many celebrities into cake form, such as Rob Brydon, Steven Tyler and even Sylvester Stallone.</p>

      <p>And her talent hasn’t gone unnoticed, as she has won awards for her skills.</p>
      <p>“I have entered into the Cake International competition in Birmingham and been awarded gold, silver and bronze medals for my cakes.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see myself as the best out there, but it is nice to see people like what I am doing.”</p>

      <p>Despite Anna’s amazing talents, you won’t be seeing her on the likes of Bake Off anytime soon.</p>
      <p>“I was going to apply, but because I have sold my cakes for money I am not classed as an amateur. I would love to go on.”</p>
      <p>Anna will also have a busy 2020, helping organise and judge a new bakery competition in Scotland.</p>

      <p>“There is a definite lack of competitions of that nature in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“I’ve teamed up with Melanie Andrews MBE to be a judge of one next year. I want to show everyone the talent of some of these cake makers. They are incredible.”</p>
