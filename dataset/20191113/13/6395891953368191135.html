      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - An early morning fire in a three-story home has left a Massachusetts fire lieutenant dead and another firefighter in serious condition.</p>
      <p>Worcester Fire Chief Michael Lavoie says Lt. Jason Menard and his crew became trapped on the third-floor after the fire was reported at about 1 a.m. Wednesday. Menard helped two members of his crew escape but he himself was unable to get out.</p>
      <p>Menard and three other firefighters were taken to the hospital. Menard was declared dead, another firefighter was in serious condition and two were treated and released.</p>
      <p>Menard leaves behind a wife and three children.</p>
      <p>Menard's death comes less than a year after the on-duty of death of Worcester firefighter Christopher Roy, and about a month before the 20th anniversary of the deaths of six Worcester firefighters in a warehouse blaze in December 1999.</p>
