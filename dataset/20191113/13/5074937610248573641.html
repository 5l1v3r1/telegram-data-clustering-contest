      <p>Effia-Kwesimintsim (W/R), Nov.13, GNA - Mr Jojo Acquah, the Municipal Chief Executive of the Effia-Kwesimintsim Municipal Assembly (EKMA), has given the assurance that all the Government flagship programmes and interventions would be duly executed in the Municipality.</p>
      <p>He said though the Assembly was among the newly created assemblies, it was working hard to mobilise all available resources to facilitate and improve upon the lives of people within the Municipality.</p>
      <p>Mr Acquah said this during the maiden Meet-the-Press to deliberate on government flagship programmes and projects in the Municipality and that all the programmes were moving on steadily.</p>
      <p>The MCE said his team of dedicated young men and women were working assiduously for the development of the area.</p>
      <p>Touching on what the Assembly had been able to do in the Educational sector, Mr Acquah mentioned the Takoradi Senior High School (TADISCO) and Takoradi Technical Institute (TTI) as the only schools in the area  benefitting from the Free Senior High School.</p>
      <p>He said in this regard TADISCO got a girls dormitory block and a six- unit-classroom block.</p>
      <p>Mr Acquah said a total of 12,275 pupils from 24 Kindergarten and primary schools were benefiting from the School Feeding Programme, resulting in an increase in enrollment and reduction in school dropouts in the Municipality.</p>
      <p>A total of GH¢165,113 has been disbursed to 122 tertiary students made up of 56 males and 66 females under the District Level Scholarship Programme.</p>
      <p>On Agriculture, Mr Acquah said 701 farmers, comprising 432 males and 269 females, had been registered under the Planting for Food and Jobs with the beneficiary farmers cultivating maize, tomato, and pepper.</p>
      <p>He said 571 farmers had also been registered under the Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) with two cash crops; oil palm and coconut; being cultivated. </p>
      <p>On Security and Safety, Mr. Aquah said the Assembly had been able to construct a police station at Kwesimintsim and erected traffic lights on most of the major roads within the Municipality including Asakae and Kwesimintsim Junction and Airport Ridge Junction.</p>
      <p>He said nine community watchdog committees had been formed to beef up security in the various communities.</p>
      <p>Touching on Internally Generated Funds of the Assembly, he indicated that GH¢1,751,082.90 had been collected as at September, this year, as against GH¢3,657,200.00  projected for the year.</p>
      <p>The programme also saw the launch of the District Level Election and the Referendum to be held on December 17, with a call on the media to educate the public on those processes.</p>
