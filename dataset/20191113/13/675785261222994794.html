      <h1>Murderer sentenced to death gets another last meal on death row as appeal rejected</h1>
      <h2>Ray "Jeff" Cromartie, 52, told the Board of Pardons and Paroles in Georgia, US, he is innocent despite being convicted for the 1994 murder of shop owner Richard Slysz</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:45:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murderer</a> sentenced to death will tonight have his final meal for the second time after his first scheduled execution was suddenly axed.</p>
      <p>Ray "Jeff" Cromartie, 52, had a desperate appeal to stop his execution rejected.</p>
      <p>The killer was originally scheduled to die October 30 but he insisted he did not shoot dead shop owner Richard Slysz during a robbery some 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>He appealed the decision after requesting his first meal, local media says. It's unclear what that was.</p>
      <p>And he will receive lethal injection in Georgia, US, tonight after a giant second last meal of macaroni and cheese, steak, rice and gravy, a steak and cheese sandwich, a double cheeseburger, French fries, a side of ranch dressing, a strawberry milkshake and layered cake with white icing.</p>
      <p>He has always conceded he and his co-defendant Corey Clark were guilty of robbery but claimed neither he or his pal didn't know who pulled the trigger to shoot Mr Slysz.</p>

      <p>The Board of Pardons and Paroles in Georgia, US, dismissed his argument.</p>
      <p>Mr Slysz, 50, was murdered at Junior Food Store in Thomasville, near the Florida border.</p>
      <p>But Clark and getaway driver, Thad Lucas, were both cleared of murder charges.</p>
      <p>They were imprisoned for the roles in the heist but released in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>Speaking previously after Cromartie made his appeal, Melven Johnson, of the Thomasville Police Department, said: "A jury has found him guilty and sentenced him to death.</p>
      <p>"I think to give these families and this victim some satisfaction and let them get this off their minds, it needs to happen."</p>
