      <h1>Arnold Schwarzenegger criticised for driving 'tank' to run errands despite being a climate activist</h1>

      <p>Cape Town - Arnold Schwarzenegger made running errands look like a military mission when he was recently spotted driving around in a tank-like SUV.</p>
      <p>The 72-year-old was seen struggling to get back into his military-style vehicle which reportedly costs between $18 000 and $70 000 (R270 000 and R1 million), <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/arnold-schwarzenegger-drives-tank-climate-change"><b>FOX News</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>Fans of <i>The Terminator </i>star found his choice of transport odd as he’s known to be an outspoken activist against climate change.</p>
      <p>This outing came days after his widely publicised bicycle ride with climate change activist Greta Thunberg (16), <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/12/arnold-schwarzenegger-runs-errands-in-tank-like-suv/"><b>Page Six</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>But social media users have taken to twitter to accuse the former Governor of California of being a hypocrite, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7672069/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-72-drives-new-100K-Pinzgauer-military-vehicle-California.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>One user posted pictures of the star’s military vehicle and a private jet and wrote, "It would be a shame if Greta Thunberg found out just how big of a hypocrite Arnold Schwarzenegger really is..."</p>

      <p>"Hey Arnie where’s your Hummer, you hypocrite. Arnold Schwarzenegger meets his 'friend and hero' Greta Thunberg #ClimateChangeHoax," another wrote.</p>
      <p>Arnie isn’t the only Hollywood A-lister to have met with Greta.</p>
      <p>Leonardo DiCaprio recently revealed it was an honour to speak with the young activist and posted a photo of the two of them together.</p>
