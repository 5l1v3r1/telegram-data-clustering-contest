      <h1>ISL 2019-20 | Team of the “weak” after Game Phase 2</h1>

        <b>Indian Super League has completed four rounds of matches after every team has now played four games before the League paused for the international break for two weeks. Let's take a look at players, whose performance were far from average in between matchdays November 1 - November 10.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Amrinder Singh - <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/mumbai_city_fc">Mumbai City FC</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The former ISL golden glove winner had consecutive outings as the Mumbai City FC custodian conceded eight goals in his last two games, and the fact that it was in his home stadium, Mumbai Football Arena, only makes it worse. The goalkeeper, who is also in the Indian international team under Igor Stimac, has looked shaky from set-pieces against a strong Goa and would need to buckle up in the upcoming matches. Mumbai's Jorge Costa, who plays a defensive tactic, could not hold visiting teams Goa and Odisha as both managed to score four goals each. The goalkeeper's blind positioning was a huge concern.</p>
      <h3>Defenders</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Subhashish Bose - Mumbai City FC</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mumbai City head coach Jorge Costa pays a heavy-duty for the Indian international left-back in the absence of injured foreigners in the defence. However, the Mumbai left-back couldn't also rise to the occasion because his all Indian defence partners could not hold the fort and committed individual errors. Bose was struggling to contain the Goan attack from the flanks and moreover, the young defender could not move up with the ball.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lucian Goian - <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chennaiyin_fc">Chennaiyin FC</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The Romanian defender is a workaholic in the defence, however, the veteran skipper could not manage to silence the Bengaluru forwards, conceding three goals in the process. His team's struggles in the front with no goals in 540 minutes haven't helped his cause either and the veteran enforcer's lacklustre duty against Bengaluru and ATK in the last phase has cost his side dearly. For a player of his experience, he should have led his defence to secure at least one point against stronger oppositions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tiri - Jamshedpur FC</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tiri is a big name in ISL. The tall Spanish defender has been the key to Jamshedpur head coach Antonio Iriondo's plans especially after Spaniard was phenomenal in stoping Bengaluru at the Furnace a few weeks back. However, in a highly physical battle against ATK on harsh weather conditions saw Tiri struggling to contain the in-form ATK boys Roy Krishna, David Williams, and Edu Garcia. Tiri fouled Roy Krishna inside the box for the first penalty and lose most of the physical battles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pritam Kotal - ATK</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pritam Kotal is one of the best Indian defenders in the league. He is a regular in the national team under Stimac and had a decent campaign so far, the season. However, his outing against Jamshedpur on harsh weather was disappointing. The ATK captain made sloppy fouls to earn a silly yellow card and was also terrible with his passing accuracy of 56%. However, his defensive partners Agus Garcia and Anas Edathodika saved his face and the day for ATK.</p>
      <h3>Midfielders </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Mouhamadou Gning - <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/kerala_blasters_fc">Kerala Blasters FC</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Kerala Blasters' new singing from Senegal, Gning is an important player under coach Eelco Schattorie. The defensive midfielder has crucial duties in the absence of Kerala's injured midfielders, both in the defence and midfield. However, the Senegalese midfielder's two sloppy fouls cost Kerala an important away win against Hyderabad. His first foul in the penalty box resulted in a Stankovic penalty and when he fouled Nikhil Poojary outside the box, it was a dangerous position from where Marchelinho struck a beautiful banana kick to ease it past Kerala custodian Rehanesh. However, the Sengalesee midfielder's work rate has been unquestionable, especially against Odisha with his midfield partner Sergio Cidoncha.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nikhil Kadam - <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/northeast_united_fc">NorthEast United FC</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The midfielder had two disappointing matches against Goa and Hyderabad. He was passing poorly at an average of around 50 % in both the matches and things looked really bad when the Highlanders coach Robert Jarni substituted him in both matches. His team had more coordination in the midfield without him and despite his successful tackles in the defensive third, he would need to up his passing game.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/vinit_rai">Vinit Rai</a> - Odisha FC</b>
      </p>
      <p>Odisha FC head coach Josep Gombau was confident of a win against an injury-plagued Kerala and they should have had one. But, midfielder Vinit Rai with Odisha captain Tebar could not take the initiative forward as they looked to struggle to keep the ball passing under pressure. Rai had an average passing of 68% and his failure to control the game in the midfield saw the Blasters eventually hold on to a draw.</p>
      <h3>Forwards</h3>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/robin_singh">Robin Singh</a> - Hyderabad FC</b>
      </p>
      <p>For an injury-plagued side like Hyderabad FC, their experienced Indian players like Robin Singh should take initiatives to convert the chances in the attacking third. However, even with coach Phil Brown's support, the Indian forward has regularly misfired at the front. The main problem of Robin Singh is his inability to keep the balls and with a passing accuracy of just over 50 %, he struggles to move the ball. Younger teammates of him made better chances in Hyderabad.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nerijus Valskis - Chennaiyin FC</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chennaiyin FC coach John Gregory signed the Lithuanian International forward Nerijus Valskis this season in hope of curing the goal-scoring drought at the Chennaiyin front. However, with the club four games old already, Chennaiyin could not even find the net once. For Chennai's 540-minute goal-scoring drought, one cannot blame Nerijus alone obviously. There are other players like Dragos, Crivellaro, Schembri, who should take equal blame, but with a passing accuracy of just 54%, Valskis has struggled a lot and his misfiring at goal also hints at lack of confidence.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Manuel Onwu - <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bengaluru_fc">Bengaluru FC</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Carles Cuadrat signed fellow Spanish forward, Manuel Onwu, in the place of their former talisman Miku. The Venezuelan had left a huge void in the Bengaluru attack which Manuel Onwu has failed to fill so far. He had many chances against Jamshedpur but failed to score past a Subrata Pal, who was in fine form. However, the Spaniard can’t be written off considering his experience in Spain.</p>
