      <h1>Kanye West's support for Trump, comments on slavery condemned by Atlanta pastor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:45:16+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Caleb Parke</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>'s recent remarks about slavery and his support of President Trump does not sit well with a Georgia pastor.</p>
      <p>Dr. Jamal Harrison Bryant, who pastors New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, where West <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-jesus-christian-kardashian-sunday-service">preached a 10-minute mini-sermon about "radical obedience to Jesus"</a> in September, took to his pulpit Sunday to bash the newly born-again believer's comments.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Bryant acknowledged that West's new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-jesus-king-album-song-charts">"Jesus Is King"</a> album is "hot" and "good," but he blamed the entertainer and fashion mogul for making Trump, whom he called West's "orange friend," feel comfortable enough to launch his new re-election campaign initiative <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/black-voices-trump-campaign-liberal-media">"Black Voices for Trump"</a> on Friday in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>"It's in between the songs," Bryant told his congregation Sunday, according to <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/pastor-atlanta-sunday-service-condemn-kanye-west-trump-support">Complex</a>. "I can't rest with Kanye saying slavery was an option....black people should vote Republican because that's the group that kept us free...when Kanye would endorse Donald Trump, who has never done a thing for black people. And because he endorsed him, Donald Trump thought he could come to Georgia and nobody would check him."</p>

      <p>On the same day Trump launched "Black Voices for Trump," the 42-year-old rapper <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-black-americans-not-vote-democrats-power">encouraged black voters in the United States</a> not to vote for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats">Democrats</a> at an event in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a>.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>“Own your power. Your power is not to just vote Democrat for the rest of our lives," West said. "That’s not the power.”</p>
      <p>During his appearance at the Fast Company Innovation Festival that same day, West also revived speculation that he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-running-for-president-2024">someday may seek the highest office in the land</a>.</p>

      <p>"When I run for president in 2024, we're going to definitely- yo whatchu all laughing at?" West reacted to the laughing crowd. "When I run for president in 2024, we would've created so many jobs that, in fact, I'm going to walk."</p>
      <p>Bryant, in turn, has vowed that he would not "bow down or sell-out" in speaking about his denouncement of West and Trump. Sunday was not the first time the reverend has spoken against West. He blasted the hip-hop artist for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-trump-mental-slavery">saying it's "mental slavery"</a> to make political decisions based on race at a Salt Lake City service in October.</p>

      <p>"That's the Republican Party that freed the slaves," said West, who has been defending himself against critics who have slammed him since he came out last year as a Trump supporter.</p>

      <p>Bryant was so offended by West's views, he decided to <a href="https://e-news.us/new-birth-missionary-baptist-church-redirects-kanye-wests-sizable-donation-to-morris-brown-after-trump-exaltation/">redirect a "sizeable" donation</a> the recording artist made to his church to Morris Brown College, where West's mother used to work.</p>
