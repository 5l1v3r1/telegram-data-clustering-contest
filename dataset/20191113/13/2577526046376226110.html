      <h1>The First Disco Elysium Mods Have Arrived</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:15:38+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>I still have a long way to go with my first <i>Disco Elysium </i>runthrough, but I know I'll be coming back to it after my stint with my current well-meaning, but incredibly stupid, character. That's partly because I want to experience the game from the perspective of a character who actually understands what a detective's job is, but also the result of the game's burgeoning modding community.</p>
      <p>It's still in the very early stages, but modder Castar has created a framework for the game over on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/discoelysium/mods/4">Nexusmods.</a> By Castar's own admission, it's pretty barebones, but should make developing new mods for the game easier in future. As a starting point, Castar has developed an <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/discoelysium/mods/5">Advanced Character Creation</a> tool, which "provides an alternate way to create your character." Rather than using abilities to improve your skills, you'll be given a set number of points which can then be used to directly improve on those same skills, giving you a little extra control over the way your character interacts with the world.</p>
      <p>The new modding tools don't really extend to things like UI and graphics (although that hasn't stopped a few Reshade mods from showing up), but should give writers significant freedom over <i>Disco Elysium</i>'s script, potentially even adding new emotions into the mix at some point in the future. Developer ZA/UM has plans for everything <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/04/disco-elysium-devs-want-to-make-an-expansion-a-sequel-and-a-tabletop-game">from an expansion to a tabletop game</a>, but until those arrive, this could be your first opportunity to explore a little bit more of Revachol.</p>
