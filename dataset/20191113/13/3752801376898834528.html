      <p>Dhaka â€“ Two packed trains rammed into each other in Bangladesh on Tuesday, killing at least 16 people and injuring nearly 60 others, police said.</p>
      <p>Three coaches were sent crashing off the tracks at Mondobhag station in the town of Kasba when a Dhaka-bound train and a locomotive bound for Chittagong collided.</p>
      <p>"At least 16 people have been killed. And another 58 were injured. We have sent the injured to different hospitals in the region," local police chief Anisur Rahman told AFP.</p>
      <p>Cranes and other lifting gear were brought in to rescue trapped passengers, many of whom were asleep when the early morning crash took place.</p>
      <p>"There was a loud noise, then I saw the train was completely ripped apart," one injured passenger told Somoy TV.</p>
      <p>"All the people around me were crying. There was blood everywhere. Some people had broken hands and legs," another told the broadcaster.</p>
      <p>"My son was with me. I still don't know what happened to him," the man added.</p>

        <b>'Three coaches badly mangled'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hayat ud Doula Khan, a government official in the district, said the Dhaka-bound Turna Nishitha train hit the Chittagong-bound Udayan Express at about 03:00, as the Udayan was about to go through Mondobhog station.</p>
      <p>Khan told AFP that the Turna Nishitha should have waited outside the station to let the other train pass and that an investigation had been started. A Bangladesh railway official told reporters that faulty signals could be to blame.</p>
      <p>"Three coaches were badly mangled, and the victims are from these coaches," Khan said, adding that train services out of Dhaka had been halted because of the accident.</p>
      <p>Train accidents are common in Bangladesh and are often caused by poor signalling or other rundown infrastructure.</p>
      <p>According to the Shipping and Communication Reporters Forum (SCRF), a private media research group, between January 1 and June 30 this year, at least 202 rail accidents took place in the South Asian country of 168 million people, where some of the track is a century old.</p>
      <p>In June, a train plunged into a canal after the bridge it was crossing gave way. Five people were killed and 100 injured.</p>
      <p>The SCRF said pedestrians using mobile phones while crossing tracks, negligence by railway employees and poor maintenance of lines and bridges were the main cause of crashes.</p>
