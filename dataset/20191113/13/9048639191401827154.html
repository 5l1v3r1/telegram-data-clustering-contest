      <p><b>NEW YORK (AP) —</b> A Roman Catholic bishop named by Pope Francis to investigate the church’s response to clergy sexual abuse in Buffalo, New York, has himself been accused of sexual abuse of a child.</p>
      <p>An attorney for the alleged victim notified Catholic officials in New Jersey this week that he is preparing a lawsuit on behalf of a client who says he was molested by Brooklyn Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio in the 1970s, when DiMarzio was a priest in Jersey City. In a letter, lawyer Mitchell Garabedian says 56-year-old Mark Matzek alleges he was repeatedly abused by DiMarzio when he was an altar boy.</p>
      <p>DiMarzio says there is no truth to the accusation.</p>
      <p>Buffalo Bishop Joseph Malone has come under fire for his handling of a clergy abuse scandal that has roiled the diocese.</p>
