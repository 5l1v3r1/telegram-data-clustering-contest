      <p>“I went to see his body yesterday and I was begging him to open his eyes,” said Ms Moss said.</p>
      <p>“I want him to come home. I just want Ronald back.</p>

      <p>“He would always come and see me, and he looked out for all of my kids. If any harm came to them he sorted it all out.</p>
      <p>“He came out of prison a couple of weeks ago, after being inside for 14 days, and he rang me and said, ‘Mam, I’m out’.</p>
      <p>“I was laughing at him and joked when his next holiday would be. That was the last time I got to speak with him properly.”</p>
      <p>Ms Moss celebrated her 50th birthday three days before Ronald died and he left her a voicemail wishing her a happy birthday, but she said she cannot bring herself to listen to it.</p>

      <p>“I was watching a DVD of him last night acting about and being silly,” Ms Moss said.</p>
      <p>“He would dress up like a woman when we were at parties and make everyone laugh.</p>
      <p>"He always had the biggest grin on his face.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we’re having him cremated and I want his ashes with me. I want him to be near me all the time.”</p>
      <p>Sally Godwin, who Mr Portz had children with, has been charged with murder.</p>
