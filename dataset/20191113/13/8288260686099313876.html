      <p>These shocking pictures show the wreckage of two supercars which were involved in a horrific high-speed smash.</p>
      <p>The devastating collision involved a grey Ferrari 458, costing up to £200,000, and a red Porsche 911, worth around £100,000.</p>
      <p>Ferrari driver Carl Hartley, 32, was speeding in Sheffield, South Yorks, on May 20 last year when he lost control of his vehicle.</p>
      <p>His car smashed into fellow speeding motorist Henry Hibbs, 27, who was in his Porsche and suffered minor injuries.</p>
      <p>Both drivers appeared at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday (Tues), when they were found guilty of dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>The court heard a number of witnesses told investigators the motorists' were driving "dangerously" and "unsafely" prior to the smash.</p>

      <p>Both vehicles were captured on numerous CCTV footage at various locations exceeding the speed limits of the road they were on.</p>
      <p>The court heard Hartley, from Swadlincote, Derbs, fled the scene of the crash.</p>
      <p>When officers eventually caught up with the offender he admitted being involved but claimed his brakes had failed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The airbag unit from his Ferrari was examined and it was found the bags were deployed when the car was travelling at 68mph in a 50mph zone.</p>
      <p>No damage to the braking system was found.</p>
      <p>Assistant police sergeant McEnery, who led the investigation, said: “I would like to thank the members of the public who came forward and assisted us with this investigation.</p>
      <p>“Your help and commitment to making South Yorkshire a safer place does not go unnoticed.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A/PS McEnery also stated the roads should not be used as racetracks, adding that they have speed limits for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>He said: “Vehicles racing and travelling at speed are a dangerous combination, both drivers were extremely lucky that neither were seriously injured or caused injury to an innocent road user.”</p>
      <p>Hartley and Hibbs, from Ollerton, Notts, will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
