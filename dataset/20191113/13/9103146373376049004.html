Six-time champions Express FC host the reigning Uganda Premier League champions KCCA FC at 4 pm at the Kabaka Kyabagu Stadium in Wakiso.<br/> <br/>The champions who are still recovering from the humiliating of 4-1 defeat to Algerian side Paradou AC in the CAF Confederations Cup return to action with the aim of defending their title.<br/> <br/>KCCA head coach Mike Mutebi anticipates a tight game basing on the rich history between the clubs.</p>

      <p> “KCCA FC against Express FC is a derby, and you know what happens in a derby.No one is bigger than the other. It is always the most well-organised team that takes the day,” Mutebi reasoned.<br/> <br/>He said the return of three of his key players who missed the clash with Police clash was a big boost for his side.<br/> <br/>“They were not missed because like I always say, every player at the club is good. Those who played did a good job, but Mustafa Kizza, John Revita and Muziramu Mutyaba are starters, so their return is a big boost in some way,” Mutebi said.</p>
