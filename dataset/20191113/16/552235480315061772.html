      <p>Requests for a school crossing patrol for four Cambuslang primary schools have been rejected by South Lanarkshire Council for a second time this year.</p>
      <p>New Road, Overton Road and Woodland Crescent were all assessed by South Lanarkshire Council, which found “insufficient” demand to justify new patrols to assist pupils at Park View, Hallside, Cairns and St Cadoc’s primaries.</p>
      <p>Traffic and transportation engineer Stuart Laird told the council’s roads safety forum last week that the criteria for a crossing patroller was not met on any three of the roads used on the school commute.</p>
      <p>Roads staff assessed all sites in August and September to determine the pedestrian demand and vehicle flow at <br/>the busiest times in the school day.</p>
      <p>Neither New Road (45 per cent) or Woodland Crescent (44 per cent) reached the 50 <br/>per cent threshold for an additional assessment to consider other environmental factors.</p>
      <p>The demand on the third route, Overton Road, was assessed at 28 per cent.</p>
      <p>Mr Laird said the criteria used was based on “national best practice” and was last updated in 2015.</p>
      <p>But parents have branded the assessments as “useless’ and argue the problems on the roads, particularly Woodlands Crescent, which leads to Cairns and St Cadoc’s primaries, are well documented.</p>
      <p>Gayle Murphy, who has two children at Cairns Primary, said: “Any time we have seen the assessments done it’s one person at one bit of the road.</p>
      <p>“They have not been up and down Woodland Crescent and assessed crossing at different points.</p>
      <p>“We have the shops at the end of the road so we have trucks parked up there, school buses dropping off from the high school and the traffic itself is a nightmare. All of these factors mean a crossing is desperately needed.”</p>
      <p>Explaining up to 600 children use Woodlands Crescent to get to school or nursery, Gayle added: “If there was a safe crossing, even traffic lights, not necessarily a person, but some sort of facility, it would put people off bringing cars because they would know they could walk to school safely.</p>
      <p>“I would definitely feel more conformable if something was put in place.”</p>
      <p>The council’s road safety forum agreed in March that further assessments of New Road and Woodland Crescent should take place.</p>
      <p>It followed a campaign earlier in the year when parents were again told the roads did not meet the criteria for a school crossing patroller.</p>
