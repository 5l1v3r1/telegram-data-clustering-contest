      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Mike Evans, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Michael_Thomas/?tps=1">Michael Thomas</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tyreek-Hill/?tps=1">Tyreek Hill</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Julio-Jones/?tps=1">Julio Jones</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Amari-Cooper/?tps=1">Amari Cooper</a> top my Week 11 fantasy <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Walker/?tps=1">football</a> wide receiver rankings for 2019.</p>
      <p>Chris Godwin, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Julian-Edelman/?tps=1">Julian Edelman</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/DeAndre-Hopkins/?tps=1">DeAndre Hopkins</a>, Cooper Kupp and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Brown/?tps=1">John Brown</a> round out my top 10 options for Week 11.</p>
      <p>If you don't have an elite option, there are plenty of capable pass catchers with great Week 11 matchups. Be sure to check out my <a href="https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2019/11/12/Fantasy-football-Week-11-best-adddrops-from-waiver-wire/9321573578163/">weekly waiver wire article</a> if you are in need of a new player at the position.</p>
      <p>You should target players who have a good chance to score a touchdown and get a lot of looks from their respective quarterbacks, when considering who to start at wide receiver.</p>
      <p>You should remove <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Green_Bay_Packers/?tps=1">Green Bay Packers</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_York_Giants/?tps=1">New York Giants</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Seattle-Seahawks/?tps=1">Seattle Seahawks</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tennessee-Titans/?tps=1">Tennessee Titans</a> players from your lineup, as those teams have Week 11 byes.</p>
      <p>Here are some of my favorite players in this week's rankings:</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOP SHELF</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers/?tps=1">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> star Mike Evans is my No. 1 wide receiver for Week 11. Evans has been scorching hot since Week 3, with either a touchdown and/or 82 receiving yards in six of seven games during that stretch. He also has averaged one touchdown per game in each of his last seven contests. Evans has scored three times and is averaging 153 receiving yards per game in his last three games. All of Evans' stats point in his favor for Week 11, and that's before you consider he is set to face the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-Orleans-Saints/?tps=1">New Orleans Saints</a>, a unit allowing the ninth-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Evans and fellow Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin are both top-six options in Week 11.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_England_Patriots/?tps=1">New England Patriots</a> veteran Julian Edelman is my No. 7 option for Week 11. Edelman is tied for the fifth-most targets in the NFL. He is <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tom_Brady/?tps=1">Tom Brady</a>'s go-to target. The Super Bowl LIII MVP had a season-high 10 catches in Week 9, before the Patriots Week 10 bye. I expect the Patriots to come out hot after having the week off to rebound from their first loss of the season. Edelman will be going up against a <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Philadelphia-Eagles/?tps=1">Philadelphia Eagles</a> defense allowing the sixth-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Start Edelman as a WR1 going forward, especially in points-per-reception formats.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SNEAKY PLAYS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cincinnati-Bengals/?tps=1">Cincinnati Bengals</a> remain winless and turned to a new quarterback in Week 10, but <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tyler-Boyd/?tps=1">Tyler Boyd</a> remains a fantasy football starting option. Boyd has just one score on the season, but I think he could elevate to WR2 status in Week 11 against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Oakland-Raiders/?tps=1">Oakland Raiders</a>, a unit allowing the third-most fantasy points per game to the position. Boyd is my No. 17 option this week due to the matchup.</p>
      <p>D.J. Moore is my No. 18 option for Week 11, landing in WR2 territory. The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Carolina_Panthers/?tps=1">Carolina Panthers</a> pass catcher has a matchup against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Atlanta-Falcons/?tps=1">Atlanta Falcons</a>, a unit allowing the seventh-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Moore has back-to-back games with at least 100 receiving yards entering this great matchup. He should post at least seven catches and has a chance to get to 100 receiving yards once again in Week 11.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LONGSHOTS</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Washington-Redskins/?tps=1">Washington Redskins</a> rookie Terry McLaurin had five touchdowns in his first five career games, but hasn't scored since Week 6. I like his chances to rebound in Week 11 against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Jets/?tps=1">New York Jets</a>, a defense tied for allowing the most touchdowns to wide receivers and allowing the second-most fantasy points per game to the position. The Jets and Redskins should have a close game here and McLaurin should post low-end WR2/high-end WR3 numbers. I have the rookie at No. 19 in my weekly rankings.</p>
      <p>Deebo Samuel is another rookie who should have a big Week 11. The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/San-Francisco-49ers/?tps=1">San Francisco 49ers</a> pass catcher went off for a season-high 112 yards on eight catches in Week 10. He should post similar numbers in Week 11 against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Arizona-Cardinals/?tps=1">Arizona Cardinals</a>, a unit allowing the 10th-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Samuel is my No. 25 option this week and is also one of my favorite waiver wire/free agent pickups.</p>
