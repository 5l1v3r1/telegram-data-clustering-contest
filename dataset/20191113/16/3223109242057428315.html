      <h1>More Nickelodeon Is Coming to Netflix</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:54:19+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>Between Marvel superheroes and animated princesses, Disney+ may seem like the only game in town when it comes to <a href="https://www.geek.com/geek-pick/cut-the-cord-and-subscribe-to-these-streaming-tv-services-1704574/">streaming TV services</a> that won’t accidentally radicalize your kids like YouTube. But plenty of 90s kids like me will tell you that <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/10-best-classic-nickelodeon-episodes-on-nicksplat-1750672/">Nickelodeon’s cartoon cast of characters</a> are arguably more meaningful to our childhood than anything Mickey Mouse stuck his fingers in. And the streaming service seizing this opportunity is Netflix thanks to a new deal with the orange slime factory.</p>
      <p>“Netflix and Nickelodeon today announced that they have formed a new, multi-year output deal to produce original animated feature films and television series,” both companies said in a statement. “Based both on the Nickelodeon library of characters as well as all-new IP – for kids and families around the world.”</p>

      <p>It’s not too surprising. As the statement later says, earlier this year Netflix was the exclusive home for two long-awaited NickToons specials: <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/invader-zim-and-rockos-modern-life-tv-movies-bring-nickelodeon-to-netflix-1797301/"><i>Invader Zim Enter: The Florpus</i> and <i>Rocko’s Modern Life: Static Cling</i></a>. These older-skewing retro revivals just made more sense on streaming than on actual TV.</p>
      <p>But it’s nice to know that Nickelodeon won’t be left out of the streaming war engulfing all out entertainment. They have too much to offer! Netflix and Nick are already working on special based on <i>The Loud House</i> and <i>Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>. And there’s still the <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/avatar-the-last-airbender-gets-another-live-action-remake-on-netflix-1752715/">live-action <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> Netflix show</a> still looming on the horizon.</p>
      <p>For more on Nickelodeon, well, we have a lot of posts on <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>. Read our review of the inexplicable <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/why-and-how-is-there-a-spongebob-squarepants-broadway-musical-1727557/">SpongeBob Broadway musical</a>.
