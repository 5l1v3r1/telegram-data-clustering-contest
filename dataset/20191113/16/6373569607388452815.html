      <h1>Anger after Plymstock Broadway fish and chip shop is refused</h1>
      <h2>Praxis Real Estate Management says the refusal is a 'kick in the teeth' that will sterilise the shopping centre</h2>

      <p>The owners of The Broadway in Plymstock have reacted angrily to a decision by Plymouth City Council to refuse planning permission for a new local fish and chip shop in the shopping centre.</p>
      <p>According to the Refusal Decision Notice from <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-city-council">Plymouth City Council</a>, the fish and chip shop, which was set to replace the empty retail unit at 34 The Broadway, was refused planning permission due to its 'odour and noise' and because of its 'unhealthy food environment'.</p>
      <p>Praxis Real Estate Management, which owns The Broadway, says the refusal comes as Plymouth City Council's Joint Local Plan prohibits planning permission being granted for a new takeaway if the proposed site falls within 400 metres of a school.</p>
      <p>Praxis says the 'bizarre' decision to refuse planning permission for the new fish and chip shop is a 'kick in the teeth' that will 'effectively sterilise the shopping centre in terms of the much-needed hot food takeaway trade'.</p>
      <p>According to the Refusal Decision Notice from Plymouth City Council, the proposed new takeaway was refused as its site is close to <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymstock">Plymstock </a>school, and thus conflicts with the Plymouth and South West Devon Joint Local Plan 2019, and also conflicts with National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to 'enable and support healthy lifestyles through the access to healthier food'.</p>
      <p>The planning permission was also refused because the 'odour and noise levels' from the take-away would cause 'an adverse impact on neighbouring residential amenity,' according to the council.</p>
      <p>Councillor Michael Leaves, who represents Plymstock Radford ward, told Plymouth Live that the Joint Local Plan prohibiting the takeaway is a "good ruling" and he supports the idea that take-aways 'must not be near the schools'.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Praxis Real Estate Management, which owns The Broadway, Mr Richard Allen said: "At a time when the retail industry is under constant siege, with national and local retailers closing left right and centre, Plymouth City Council ought to be bending over backwards to encourage investment in The Broadway, but instead they have taken a decision to refuse planning permission for a vital new business for reasons that we think most people will find impossible to understand.</p>
      <p>"A hot food takeaway is a perfectly complimentary use for a shopping centre, and a much needed local neighbourhood facility."</p>
      <p>"This decision will not only kill a new local business, with all of the implications for local jobs and investment, but it will also make our job of leasing vacant shops twice as hard by severely limiting the leasing options available to us.</p>
      <p>"Quite frankly, this decision by the council could not be better calculated to harm the shopping centre and the community of Plymstock that it serves if it tried," Mr Allen added.</p>
      <p>Praxis also said that in spite of this setback, there has been an increase in small, independent, local and family-run businesses locating within the shopping centre in recent months.</p>
