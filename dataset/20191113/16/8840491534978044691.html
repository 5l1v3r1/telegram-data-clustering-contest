      <p>AN appeal has been issued to An Garda Siochana in Mayo to clampdown on cyclists on footpaths.</p>
      <p>It follows an incident in which an elderly woman was knocked down at Linenhall Street in Castlebar.</p>
      <p>Councillor Ger Deere said the cyclist entered the street from the archway into SuperValu before the accident occurred.</p>
      <p>He hit out: “We need byelaws in this town to prevent this kind of thing from happening. Cyclists should not be on footpaths unless they are pushing their bikes.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Michael Kilcoyne said the location in question is particularly dangerous for pedestrians already without the added peril of a cyclist appearing from nowhere.</p>
