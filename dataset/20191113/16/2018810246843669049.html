      <p>An Australian gamer has avoided a jail term after confessing to hitting his then-pregnant girlfriend during a Twitch stream of <i>Fortnite</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Content warning: this story contains references to domestic assault.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Luke Munday, also known as MrDeadMoth on Twitch, was given a 14-month community corrections order in Picton Local Court after <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/07/aussie-streamer-pleads-guilty-to-assaulting-girlfriend-during-stream/">admitting he was guilty of the assault</a> in July of this year, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/fortnite-gamer-luke-munday-escapes-jail-term/11699820">the ABC reports</a>.</p>
      <p>He was charged with a single count of common assault (domestic violence).</p>

      <p>During the sentencing hearing, Munday's lawyer, Steven Mercael, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/fortnite-gamer-luke-munday-escapes-jail-term/11699820">argued the streamer</a> acted in "excessive self-defence" and snapped.</p>
      <p>"He's a loving, caring person with no history of domestic violence... who unfortunately on this day just slapped his partner," Mr Mercael said, later withdrawing the 'just' from his remarks after a caution from the judge.</p>
      <p>During <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/07/aussie-streamer-pleads-guilty-to-assaulting-girlfriend-during-stream">the stream in December 2018</a>, channel viewers could reportedly hear Munday and his then-partner arguing. He is said to have been heard saying "fuck off dog, you don't pay the bills" before the assault occurred off-camera in front two children, one aged 3, the other 20 months.</p>
      <p>In January this year, <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/01/fortnite-streamer-returns-to-twitch-after-alleged-assault">Munday briefly returned to Twitch</a> after the streaming site suspended him. Days later, <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/01/twitch-re-suspends-alleged-domestic-abuser-after-fan-outcry/">Twitch re-suspended him</a> and while it wasn't confirmed whether this ban was permanent, his accounts on both Twitch and YouTube appear to remain unavailable at the time of writing.</p>
