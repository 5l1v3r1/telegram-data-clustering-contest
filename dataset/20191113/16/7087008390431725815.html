      <p>Binance Coin saw a notable increase of around 4.5% over the past 24 hours and it currently trades at $21.26. This caused BNB to be the best performing top-10 altcoin over the past 24 hours. BNB is also up 16.25% over the past month.</p>
      <p>Binance Coin remains the seventh-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.30 billion.</p>
      <h3>Looking at the BNB/USD 1-Day Chart:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Since <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-coin-price-analysis-despite-the-latest-bullish-binance-announcements-bnb-struggles-at-21/">our previous BNB analysis</a>, Binance Coin finally climbed above the resistance at $21.04 which is provided by the 100-days EMA. BNB now faces immediate resistance at the 200-days EMA which lies directly above.</li>
        <li>From above: The nearest level of resistance is at the 200-days EMA. Above this, resistance lies at $22, $22.74, $23.47, $24.16, and $24.52. If the bulls continue above $25, resistance is located at $25.18, $26, $26.64, and $27.47.</li>
        <li>From below: The nearest level of support lies at $21. Beneath this, support can be expected at $20.92, $20, $19.80, $18.86, and $18.16. If the selling continues beneath $18, support lies at $17.30, $16.11, and $15.54.</li>
        <li>The trading volume has remained pretty high during November.</li>
        <li>The RSI is above the 50 level to show that the bulls remain in control over the market momentum. The Stochastic RSI has recently produced a bullish crossover signal which is a strong positive signal.</li>
