        <b>Formula 1 is going to be hit with a rule and regulation overhaul for the 2021 season. However, there's a small change coming the drivers' way for the 2020 F1 season. The FIA are going to ensure fire-resistant clothing meets stricter requirements. </b>
      </p>
      <p>If a fire should occur and a driver ends up in a sea of ​​flames, the clothing must offer optimum protection for at least twelve seconds. This includes the overall, as well as the gloves, the underwear, the gloves and the shoes of a driver.</p>

      <p>The new requirements also come with an advantage for the drivers: research and development of a new material has finally been completed so that drivers can finally use a new substance after waiting for 20 years. Not only is that material stronger and more fire-resistant, but it is also considerably lighter.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Formula E driver Lucas Di Grassi was fined 10,000 Euros and three penalty points for not wearing the correct fire-resistant underwear during an event. </p>
