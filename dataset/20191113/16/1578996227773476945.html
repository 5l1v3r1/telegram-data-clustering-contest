      <p>We could fall in love with Netflix's upcoming show, <i>Selena: The Series</i>, which chronicles the life of late Tejana singer Selena Quintanilla. Nearly a year after <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a25475776/a-scripted-series-about-selena-quintanilla-is-coming-to-netflix/">news of the project</a> first broke, a sneak peek at the series—and its leading lady—is here. Below, everything we know so far.</p>
      <h3>Is there a trailer yet?</h3>
      <p>Not quite. However, Netflix recently offered a minute-long sneak peek of <i>The Walking Dead</i> star Christian Serratos as Selena. In the clip, Serratos is seen preparing to play the legendary performer by applying red lip stick, practicing her dance moves, and reading pages from the script. There's even a brief preview of the actor wearing one of Selena's famous bedazzled outfits performing onstage.</p>
      <h3>What is it about?</h3>
      <p>The show, which began filming last month, follows Selena's real-life rise to musical stardom, including her Grammy win for best Mexican-American album in 1994, and her murder at the age of 23.</p>
      <p><i>Selena: The Series </i>has officially been described as "a coming of age story following Selena Quintanilla as her dreams come true and all the heart-wrenching and life-changing choices she and her family have to make as they navigate success, family, and music."</p>

      <p>Stepping into the shoes of a younger Selena is Madison Taylor Baez, who also makes a brief appearance<b> </b>in the teaser video. Additionally, Netflix confirmed the casting of the Quintanilla family, including Gabriel Chavarria (<i>War for the Planet of the Apes</i>) as A.B. Quintanilla, Selena’s oldest brother and the band’s music producer; Ricardo Chavira (<i>Desperate Housewives</i>)<i> </i>as Abraham Quintanilla, Selena’s musician father; and Seidy Lopez<b> </b>(<i>Training Day) </i>as Marcella Quintanilla, Selena’s mother. Selena's sister and best friend Suzette Quintanilla, who becomes the first female drummer in Tejano music history, will be played by Noemi Gonzalez<b> </b>(<i>The Young and the Restless</i>).</p>
      <p>Executive producers include Jaime Dávila, Rico Martinez, Simran A. Singh, and Moisés Zamora (<i>American Crime)</i>, who will also write the script.</p>
      <p>“Selena is an inspirational figure who’s transcended generations. At Campanario, we’ve always known it was crucial for this series to find actors with the right mix of talent, charisma, and passion to honor Selena’s legacy and the story of her family,” said Dávila, president and co-founder of Campanario Entertainment, in a statement. “Our casting director Carla Hool and her team have found an amazing cast to depict the Quintanilla family, and we’re sure fans everywhere will be captivated yet again by Selena’s incredible life.”</p>
      <h3>Is Selena's family involved with the show?</h3>
      <p>Yes! When Netflix announced the series in December 2018, they confirmed that members of Selena's family would develop and executive produce it. Suzette is one of the producers on the project and had this to say when it was announced in 2018:</p>
      <blockquote>"Selena will always have a lasting place in music history and we feel great responsibility to do justice to her memory. With this series, viewers will finally get the full history of Selena, our family, and the impact she has had on all of our lives. We are excited to partner with Campanario and Netflix to give fans a never-before-seen glimpse at our story and highlight why Selena will remain a legend for generations to come."</blockquote>
