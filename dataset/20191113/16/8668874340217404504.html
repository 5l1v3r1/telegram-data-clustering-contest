      <h1>Gatland's fury over England's antics following Wales' 2019 Six Nations win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:19:15+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:19</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Warren Gatland has revealed his fury over post-match antics by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> following Wales’ Six Nations win last February.</p>
      <p>The now former Welsh coach, who stepped away from the job at the end of the recent World Cup following a twelve-year tenure, has written a new autobiography – Pride and Passion – that is being released this week.</p>
      <p>In it he has slammed the behaviour of Eddie Jones’ beaten English following their 21-13 Principality Stadium loss nine months ago.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that Jones’ squad attempted to make a quick getaway from the scene of their defeat rather than fulfil commercial obligations.</p>
      <p>It’s also claimed that England had the TV screens switched off at the post-match players’ event because they had no appetite to watch a re-run of the match they had just been beaten in.</p>

      <p>Gatland only learned much later from WRU chairman <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/gareth-davies/">Gareth Davies</a> that England had wanted the TV screens blanked and he was angered by the English attitude.</p>
      <p>Writing in the book, Gatland said: “If I’d known it at the time, I would have hit the roof. I’d had my nose rubbed in it on more than once occasion up the road in London.</p>
      <p>“Here in Cardiff, such behaviour was suddenly deemed improper. What a joke. When you lose in rugby, you should lose well.”</p>

      <p>The book review, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wales-england-warren-gatland-autobiography-17245620">carried on wales.online.co.uk</a>, also referred to an incident that took place the day before Wales took on England at the 2015 World Cup.</p>
      <p>England players Billy and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/mako-vunipola/">Mako Vunipola</a> had dropped by the Welsh team hotel to have a coffee with their cousin Taulupe Faletau.</p>

      <p>“I butted in to tell Taulupe he’d have been free to pop over to the England base in nearby Bagshot,” said Gatland, taking up the story in his book.</p>
      <p>“At which point Mako piped up: ‘Do you think he’d have been allowed in, the way things are with us right now? There’s no fun or smiling over there’.”</p>
