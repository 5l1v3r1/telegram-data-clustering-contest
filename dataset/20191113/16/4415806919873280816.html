      <p>Jennifer Lopez has said that having to film a pole dancing scene in her movie Hustlers was her own “fault”, because she came up with the idea.</p>
      <p>The actress and singer plays stripper Ramona Vega in the comedy drama, in which she performs in front of a crowd of male revellers while wearing revealing clothing.</p>
      <p>Despite it being her own idea, she said that she was “terrified” during filming.</p>

      <p>Lopez, 50, told The Hollywood Reporter: “With Hustlers, this was the first time in a long time that I was actually terrified, really scared, to do that opening (pole dancing) number, which I suggested, of course.</p>
      <p>“It was my fault that I was there to begin with. It wasn’t written in the script.</p>
      <p>“And I was like, no, she’s the big money-maker at the club — she has to show why. We can’t say it, we have to do it. I have to dance on the pole, I have to show them, I have to go there.”</p>
      <p>Lopez added: “Then when I was there and I had the dental floss on, I’m out there in a way I’ve never been.</p>
      <p>“It was so scary, I was so terrified. I have my robe on and there’s 300 extras, all men. I think that was putting myself out there, in a way, deeper than I had ever done physically and emotionally, and playing a character that was that unapologetic in so many ways.</p>
      <p>“It was so different from who I was.”</p>

      <p>Lopez stars alongside Constance Wu, Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart in the film, which is based on a true story and follows a group of strippers who resort to robbing their rich clients after falling on hard times following the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>She has been hotly-tipped for Oscars success for her role as Ramona in the film, which was written and directed by Lorene Scafaria and which Lopez co-produced.</p>
      <p>Lopez made the revelation at a discussion with fellow film stars Laura Dern, Scarlett Johansson, Renee Zellweger, Lupita Nyong’o and Awkwafina, hosted by the US entertainment publication.</p>
