      <p>A Lagos High Court sitting in Igbosere, on Wednesday remanded two men, Sunday Igwe, 29, and Onwe Chukwuemeka, 22, in prison over alleged kidnap.</p>
      <p>The duo, who are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping, however, denied the charges.</p>
      <p>The Judge, Adedayo Akintoye, ordered that the two be remanded in prison till February 1, 2020, when the case will come up for hearing.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Prosecuting Counsel, Yusuf Sule, had told the court that the defendants and others at large conspired to commit the offences on Jan. 10, 2018 at about 8:00 p.m. at United Bus Stop, Lekki Ajah, Lagos.</p>
      <p>Sule added that the duo, while armed with a locally made single barrel pistol, kidnapped one Mrs Mildred Mbajiorgu.</p>
      <p>“In view of their plea, I hereby apply for their remand in prison and a date for trial.</p>
      <p>“The offences contravened Section 3 of Kidnap Prohibition Law 13 and Sections 411 and 2 (1) (i) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015,” the prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>Consequently, Justice Akintoye remanded the duo in prison and adjourned until Feb. 1, 2020, for hearing.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria recalled that defendants were first arraigned in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on February 20, 2018, and were remanded.</p>
      <p>They were accused of forcefully pushing the victim into their Volkswagen Golf car with registration number KRD 845 EC and took her to their hideout along Epe- Lekki expressway.</p>
