      <h1>Alex Rae in Zlatan Ibrahimovic Celtic transfer claim as striker rumours resurface</h1>
      <h2>The former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker is a free agent after leaving MLS side LA Galaxy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:11:13+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>It's fair to say <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> know how to bring the best out of Swedish strikers after Henrik Larsson's storied spell at the club.</p>
      <p>And one Hoops punter wants the Parkhead club to make a bold move for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/zlatan-ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> as the talisman left LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>As unlikely as it sounds, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> did say he was in the market for a forward after the recent injury to Vakoun Issouf Bayo.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time these bizarre rumours have surfaced but there was never any substance to them first time round.</p>
      <p>And don't expect them to have any legs this time either.</p>

      <p>He might be available on a free transfer but his wage demands will surely be through the roof, even if the Parkhead club were interested.</p>
      <p>It's a fun scenario to consider at the very least, what an addition to the Scottish game he would be. But would the former Barcelona and Inter Milan attacker get a game for the champions if he did make the shock switch?</p>
      <p>Not according to one man. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> hero Alex Rae is one who doesn't believe he would force his way into the Hoops starting XI after the blistering start to the season from Odsonne Edouard.</p>

      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://planetradio.co.uk/podcasts/superscoreboard/listen/2021324/">Clyde 1 Superscoreboard</a> , he said: "If Celtic pull it off it would be a remarkable one.</p>
      <p>"In terms of marketing, he struggles for a bit of confidence though, Ibrahimovic, isn't he a bit shy?! </p>
      <p>"But in terms of what he would bring to the table, we see some of his goals for LA Galaxy. I love the fact that, is it, Carlos Vela? the boy who he was getting embroiled in an argument with, he referred to him as a mini to a Rolls Royce, you know that type of thing. He would be brilliant for the game.</p>
      <p>"Look, Celtic play with one up top, where he would fit in, I don't know - he wouldn't get a game! He wouldn't get a game! If he comes do you think big Edouard is going to sit on the bench?"</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic spent two seasons at the MLS club and scored an impressive 31 times last term at the ripe old age of 38.</p>
      <p>It seems he's not ready to hang the boots up yet and it will be interesting to see where he ends up. But Celtic fans definitely won't be losing any sleep over the possibility of him arriving at Parkhead, that's for sure.</p>
