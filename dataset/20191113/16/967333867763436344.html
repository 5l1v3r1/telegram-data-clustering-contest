      <p>Sirsa threatened the company with legal consequences if the advertisement wasn’t taken down immediately.</p>
      <p>Questioning the obligation of using the image of the Sikh shrine in the advertisement, the politician has also asked Shein India to render a public apology for <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077189470-viral-video-shows-indias-lower-caste-women-protesting-against-bid-to-bar-their-entry-into-temple/">hurting the sentiments</a> of the Sikh community.</p>
