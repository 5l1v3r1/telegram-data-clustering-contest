      <p>A mum-of-three will never see her baby after going blind while waiting for treatment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> ’s shadow health minister today shared the heartbreaking example of the human cost of Tory austerity .</p>
      <p>Jon Ashworth said long delays in getting treatment had led to several patients in Southampton going blind.</p>
      <p>Mr Ashworth said: “Recently we heard how patients at a hospital in Southampton went blind and suffered severe sight loss because of longer waits for treatment.</p>
      <p>"Indeed a pregnant mother was left almost completely blind waiting for care. It was reported ‘she has since given birth and has never seen her daughter’s face.”</p>

      <p>The woman, in her 30s, is believed to be the same mum at the centre of a compensation case last month.</p>
      <p>She was awarded £3.2million after delays in her treatment for her eye condition led to her going blind.</p>
      <p>The woman first went to the optician in June 2016 after noticing her sight worsening.</p>
      <p>She was diagnosed with glaucoma and referred to Southampton Eye Hospital. She was prescribed eye-drops and told she would have follow-up appointments.</p>
      <p>However, it wasn't until more than 18 months later that she saw a consultant, by which time she was registered blind and the sight loss could not be reversed.</p>
      <p>She gave birth to her third child after she went blind.</p>

      <p>An internal NHS serous investigation report last year found 15 other patients were left blind or with worsened sight as a result of long delays in identifying their risk factors.</p>
      <p>The report showed more than 4,000 patients had not been seen as quickly as needed.</p>
      <p>Victoria Hydon of Moore Blatch solicitors acted on the woman's behalf and said: “The impact on our client has been devastating.</p>
      <p>“It’s a complete tragedy and there is no reason why this should have happened.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to have secured our client with the compensation she deserves.</p>
      <p>“The sizeable compensation reflects the harm that has been done and the support and care she will need for the rest of her life.”</p>

      <p>A statement from the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust said: “This is a significant national problem and, like many trusts, we are working closely with NHS England and NHS Improvement to address the growing capacity and recruitment issues in ophthalmology.</p>
      <p>“We have taken steps to address the backlog in follow-up appointments and continue to introduce measures to make further progress, with all of our patients now risk-assessed to ensure those most in need are seen at the earliest opportunity.”</p>
      <p>The statement also added that 88% of trusts have backlogs in diabetes and glaucoma and there are more than 80 consultant vacancies in England.</p>
