      <h2>TWO major government-owned sites – the former Planning Department building on South Hill and Cyril Le Marquand House – are to be sold to the Jersey Development Company, it has been announced.</h2>

      <p>Infrastructure Minister Kevin Lewis told States Members on Tuesday that the Island’s Regeneration Steering Group, the government’s development advisory body, had agreed to sell the sites to the publicly owned firm.</p>
      <p>The JEP reported last week that the JDC had ambitions to develop the almost-empty sites after its latest accounts showed record profits.</p>
      <p>In the Chamber, Deputy Lewis said the transfer of Cyril Le Marquand House, the former States office building, was due to be delayed until the first quarter of next year, as the building still housed the government’s data centre and it would take time to move it.</p>
      <p>JDC managing director Lee Henry said the firm was ‘willing and able’ to work on regenerating sites that were surplus to government requirement following the redeployment of staff to other premises. He added that the South Hill site would become a residential development, but that it was not yet clear whether the redevelopment of Cyril Le Marquand House would be for residential or office use.</p>
      <p>Deputy Lewis yesterday told Members during States questions that ‘the land will be formally conveyed via a ministerial decision’ in the near future. He said it had not yet been decided how the sites would be used.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t have a personal preference. I am a politician,’ the minister told the JEP.</p>
      <p>No details about how much the sales are worth have been revealed. However, Deputy Lewis promised the Assembly that if it ‘did not breach commercial confidentiality’ he would be ‘happy to get the information on value to Members’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the JEP, the minister confirmed the sale figure would not be a ‘peppercorn amount’, as the money was needed to fund other projects.</p>
      <p>He was asked in the Assembly by Deputy Kirsten Morel why the sites were not being sold to social-housing developer Andium Homes. Jersey needs 7,000 new homes over the next decade, a report published earlier this year said. There is a particular need for affordable housing.</p>
      <p>The minister told the Assembly that Andium were looking for sites but that ‘they would need to realise significant funds for this to happen’ and that selling the sites to the JDC would help generate some of that revenue.</p>
      <p>He told the JEP that ‘other sites’ were being considered for Andium.</p>
