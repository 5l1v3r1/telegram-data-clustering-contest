      <h1>Breast is a vital organ, protect it – Dr Caiquo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:42:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author">James Amoh Jnr, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 13, GNA - Dr Francis Caiquo, Head of Surgery Department, Tema General Hospital, has described the breast as an important organ of the body whose structure reflected its special function and needed to be protected.</p>
      <p>He called on the public to be proactive about the health of their breast by seeking professional medical screening, “we should not only go to the hospital for breast screening during the advocacy period but we must adopt a proactive healthy lifestyle to check the state of our breast consistently”.</p>
      <p>He said checking the breast regularly was vital as some breast cancer symptoms were invisible and unnoticeable until one undertakes medical examinations.</p>
      <p>Dr Caiquo said this when the Ghana News Agency visited the Tema General Hospital to assess the outcome of a Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign his outfit undertook in the October breast cancer awareness month.</p>
      <p>The campaign, which was geared at increasing awareness about the disease, also sought to help people through early detection education and provide enhanced support.</p>
      <p>Dr Caiquo said some 224 women were screened out of which 57 had abnormal growths in their breast and were still undergoing examination through biopsy.</p>
      <p>He said better screening by routine check-ups, increased awareness and continually improving treatment options are important in preventing the disease.</p>
      <p>Though rare, Dr Caiquo said, breast cancer in males was possible and were usually detected as hard lump underneath the nipple.</p>
      <p>This, he said, also leads to mortality because men are unlikely to assume that such lumps are cancerous and for that reason never seek early treatment. </p>
      <p>He said breast cancer is on the increase and is the most common cancer among women claiming many lives.</p>
      <p>He called for an intensified awareness campaign targeting women in rural communities in their local dialects on the importance of routine check-ups and self-examination. </p>
