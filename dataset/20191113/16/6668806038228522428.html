      <p>Just like the trailer of the film, the song has a traditional vibe. It features the film's lead actor Arjun Kapoor, along with Kriti Sanon, Mohnish Bahl and Padmini Kolhapure. The song is a shout out to the power of Marathas and is definitely a visual treat. The war drama dictates the events that lead to the Third battle of Panipat. Co-produced and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker the film releases on December 6.</p>
