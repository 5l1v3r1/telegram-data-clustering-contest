      <p>The constituency office of a Labour parliamentary candidate has been spray-painted with a “homophobic slur” for the third time in a month.</p>
      <p>On October 26, Luke Pollard said his office had been hit twice in the space of a fortnight, with the words “Pollard is a pedo, report that”, written on a wall.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, in a video posted on Twitter, Mr Pollard revealed his city centre office had been targeted again – this time with words including “pedo” daubed outside.</p>
      <p>Mr Pollard, who is seeking re-election in Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, praised council workers and a passing Deliveroo cyclist for helping him “wash off the hate”.</p>

      <p>He said: “As you can see behind me, my office was graffitied again last night with more homophobic slurs.</p>
      <p>“I’ve offered to sit down with the individuals that have done this, to have a cup of tea, to listen to their concerns.</p>
      <p>“That request has been ignored and they’ve clearly sent a message here that they want to continue their homophobic attacks on me.”</p>
      <p>Mr Pollard said he would not be made a victim by “people who have hate in their hearts”, or allow his staff to be “threatened and feel unsafe for going to work”.</p>
      <p>“We’ve already had the police here this morning and I thank them for their swift action today,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We’ll be co-operating fully with them and we’ll be seeking to identify the individuals involved in this.”</p>
