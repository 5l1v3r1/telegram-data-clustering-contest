      <p>MONTREAL – Erick Marciano is being called a hero after he used his SUV to block a speeding car from potentially ramming into a dozen pedestrians on René-Lévesque Boulevard.</p>
      <p>It happened at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday. <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/driver-of-suv-that-blocked-path-of-suspect-in-car-chase-may-have-saved-lives-police-say-1.4682556">Montreal police had pulled over a 19-year-old driver</a> on the busy boulevard, near Berri Street.</p>
      <p>“[I saw] a car going westbound. He burned a stop sign halfway, regretted it, backed up, but he was next to a policeman,” Marciano recalled.</p>
      <p>He says the man chatted with the officer for a minute before the vehicle took off.</p>
      <p>Two blocks later, “the policemen kind of cornered him into a snowbank. They got out of their car, pulled their guns; he managed to back up and make a really aggressive U-turn,” Marciano said.</p>
      <p>A police chase ensued.</p>
      <p>“I could see what exactly was happening. He was driving really, really fast,” Marciano said, adding that because it was lunchtime, there were a lot of people on the streets.</p>
      <p>“I decided to just put my car in his way to stop him. He went right through my car.”</p>
      <p>The father of three estimates he had milliseconds to process what he was seeing.</p>
      <p>“I was just thinking of the pedestrians that had to go home that night and I figured that it was something I had to do,” he told CTV News.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I’m a hero. I did what I had to do. If I was put in that situation again, I would not hesitate to do it again.”</p>
      <p>He says he managed to honk his horn and jump out of his vehicle “literally a second before he hit me.”</p>
      <p>The force of the collision shattered the front bumpers of both cars. A third vehicle, a taxi, was also damaged.</p>
      <p>Marciano says he thought of his wife and three children throughout the whole ordeal, adding that they’re proud of him – but definitely think he’s crazy.</p>

      <p>The experience, he adds, has been humbling.</p>
      <p>“It’s always nice to be recognized. It wasn’t at all my intention, but it’s always nice to receive a compliment,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They [the police] were very, very thankful, surprisingly thankful and very polite and nice.”</p>
      <p>Marciano admits he’s a little sad his Mercedes SUV, which he’s had for 10 years, was totalled, but adds his car insurance company is willing to pay for the damage.</p>
      <p>“It’s just metal. It really doesn’t matter,” he said. “Anything but life is replaceable.”</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old suspect was taken to hospital following the accident to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/19-year-old-charged-following-wednesday-s-dramatic-downtown-police-chase-1.4684168">He appeared in court on Wednesday where he was charged</a>.</p>
