      <p>Last week saw the release of a brand new game for Nintendo Wii, as Ubisoft dropped <i>Just Dance 2020</i> on the seventh-gen console. Given the Wii's incredible saturation of the market, particularly among families, it has remained a go-to for Holiday get-togethers long after the console generation moved on and, as such, releasing "party" titles for the platform is still a viable option to bring in a few bucks.<br/><br/>But it appears the party's over, as Ubisoft has confirmed that this newest entry in the hip-shaking franchise will be its final release on the Wii platform. "We would like to clarify that <i>Just Dance 2020</i> will be the last Ubisoft title to release on Wii," said the publisher <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-07-just-dance-2020-is-the-last-ubisoft-title-on-the-wii">in a statement to GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "We can't speak on behalf of other publishers or for Nintendo."<br/><br/>The Nintendo Wii launched in 2006 and would go on to shift over 101 million units, achieved through its novel use of motion controls and easily accessible titles such as <i>Wii Sports</i>,<i> Wii Fit</i> and <i>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games</i>. This is not to mention a run of great entries in popular Nintendo franchises such as <i>Super Mario, Metroid</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda.</i><br/><br/><i>Just Dance 2020</i> is available now on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Wii.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-07-just-dance-2020-is-the-last-ubisoft-title-on-the-wii">Just Dance 2020 is the last Ubisoft title on the Wii</a> [GamesIndustry.biz]</p>
