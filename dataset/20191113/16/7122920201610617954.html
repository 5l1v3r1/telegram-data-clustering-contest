      <p>Grace is a 5th grader at Village Elementary School near San Diego, CA. As a student who is blind, she’s used to using multiple pieces of equipment or having an aide support her. But when she started using <a href="https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/?modal_active=none">Google Classroom</a> with a screen reader, “it opened up a whole world for her,” according to Grace’s mom. She is now able to participate confidently alongside her sighted peers. </p>
      <p>Many tools in G Suite have <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1631886?hl=en">accessibility features</a> built in, including screen readers, voice typing, and braille displays—and Classroom is no different. It helps teachers create and organize assignments quickly, provide feedback efficiently, and easily communicate with students and guardians. Classroom is now used by 40 million students and educators globally, each of whom learns and teaches in a unique way. </p>
      <p>Grace is one story of a student excelling in her class with the support of technology, and we’d love to <a href="https://forms.gle/WBVEUEGdXYjBYdn27">hear from you</a> about the tools you’re using to support all learners.
