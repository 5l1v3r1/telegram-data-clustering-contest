      <h1>Carbon credits sold to investors by World Future Limited were load of hot air</h1>
      <h2>Investors hoping to help Papua New Guinea rainforest lost £2.5 million</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:38:15+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Penman, https://www.facebook.com/andrew.penman.33</a></address>
      <p>(Note: first published 13/9/2012)</p>
      <p>Here's a couple who have their fingerprints on two of the biggest investment snakepits.</p>
      <p>First there is Eren Metcalfe, director of the landbanking firm Natural Wealth Consultants.</p>
      <p>One victim was so persuaded by its sales pitch that she borrowed £10,000 from the bank to buy a plot of land near Bedford after being persuaded it could be sold for £14,000 when it got planning permission within six months.</p>
      <p>"They said they had somebody interested in developing housing there and they would get the permission," said Marcia Schuch, wife of a London minicab driver.</p>
      <p>That's not happened and she's been left with a corner of a field worth, so to speak, sod all.</p>
      <p>Natural Wealth Consultants has since gone into voluntary liquidation with debts of £171,000 - mainly owed to the taxman and not including clients like Marcia.</p>
      <p>The Department for Business has now petitioned the High Court to have it put into compulsory liquidation in the public interest, along with sister firms Proctor Capital and Land Security Management.</p>
      <p>Carbon credits, the second snakepit, are investments that offset pollution, supposedly help the environment and may bring a nice return or may be worthless - it depends what credits you buy and who you buy them from.</p>
      <p>One investor bought carbon credits for £33,000 from World Future Limited, which claimed that its pollution offset projects helped safeguard rainforests in April Salumei, Papua New Guinea.</p>

      <p>"I was cold-called," said the investor, from Westhill, Aberdeen. "I informed them that I was not interested but they continued to call, many times, with a very persuasive argument about carbon credits being an excellent investment and I, to my eternal shame, caved in.</p>
      <p>"They have now gone into voluntary liquidation, leaving me without any idea of the whereabouts of what I invested in or even if my credits are worth anything."</p>
      <p>Among the directors of World Future there's a James Ward, who coincidentally gave Companies House the same address as the registered office used by Natural Wealth Consultants.</p>

      <p>Another, 27-year-old Hollie Chapman, was a director for about three months. She happens to live in the same detached house in Loughton, Essex, as the landbanker Eren Metcalfe.</p>
      <p>And Metcalfe happens to have registered the World Future website.</p>
      <p>When Penman visited there was a white convertible Bentley in the drive behind electronic gates plus a Range Rover with the number plates E14 NWC.</p>
      <p>That's NWC as in Natural Wealth Consultants and E14 as in the banking heart of Britain in London Docklands, where the firm had a virtual office.</p>
      <p>Hollie scampered back inside while Eren said that he may fight the compulsory liquidation of his landbanking firms. "I've not yet decided. My solicitor is dealing with all this."</p>
      <p>As for the carbon-credit sales, he was adamant. "I've got no ties with World Future," he insisted</p>
      <p>What? No ties whatsover?</p>
      <p>"No," he maintained.</p>
      <p>So Penman pointed out that its website is registered in his name.</p>
      <p>"It's a mistake," said Metcalfe. "The owner of the business asked me to help set it up. I put him in touch with an IT company and they incorrectly put my name on the site."</p>
      <p>As for Hollie, he said she was only a nominee director and not involved in the management of World Future.</p>
      <p>There's more evidence to suggest that landbankers are now moving into carbon credits.</p>
      <p>The Bedfordshire site that Marcia so disastrously invested in through Natural Wealth Consultants was owned by a company called European Property Investments (UK) Ltd.</p>
      <p>As we reported last June, this company has had its assets frozen by the Financial Services Authority.</p>
      <p>One of its directors was Robert Smith, 48, of South London, who later set up Green Carbon Solutions Ltd.</p>
      <p>The FSA has warned that this firm is not authorised and said: "We believe that the organisation may be targeting UK customers."</p>
      <p>Update 21/3/13</p>
      <p>World Future Limited has been put into compulsory liquidation in the public interest after stinging investors for £2.5million.</p>
      <p>The Insolvency Service's company investigations supervisor Chris Mayhew said: "There was no credible evidence to support the assertions made to investors, who had nothing to gain and everything to lose from being contacted."</p>
      <p>The firm's sole shareholder was Hollie Chapman, 27, who scampered back inside her mansion in Loughton, Essex, when we tried to talk to her last September.</p>
      <p>She told the High Court that she held the ownership on behalf of partner Eren Metcalfe, 24, who also claimed to have nothing to do with its day-to-day running.</p>
      <p>Update 26/11/15</p>
      <p>In a new low, an investment charlatan posed as the granddaughter of an elderly couple to plunder their life savings.</p>
      <p>This saga starts in Papua New Guinea in the Pacific with what, in theory, was an admirable project to protect forests and the native people who live in them.</p>
      <p>Western companies could fund the project by buying "carbon credits" to offset their pollution.</p>
      <p>These are a favourite of conmen who sell them as investments - with disastrous consequences.</p>
      <p>Eight linked firms in this snake pit have been <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/8-companies-involved-in-multi-million-pound-international-carbon-credit-and-wine-investment-scam-ordered-to-close">put into compulsory liquidation in the High Court</a> in the public interest, including London Carbon Neutral Limited.</p>

      <p>It promised a "safe haven for your future" and "seriously high yields" but in reality the carbon credits that it sold were massively overpriced.</p>
      <p>Among the victims were a couple called Mr and Mrs Speed, who were in poor health.</p>
      <p>A sales rep calling herself Kirsty Green befriended them, posed as their granddaughter, and even managed to have their post redirected to London Carbon Neutral's offices in Croydon.</p>
      <p>"They were trying to gain power of attorney over all their affairs," Tiran Nersessian QC for the Department for Business told the court.</p>
      <p>"They got away with misrepresentations to sell carbon credits but given the opportunity they will go much, much further.</p>
      <p>"The general trend is of high pressure sales and often the selection of potential investors who were vulnerable." The Speeds lost around £2million to this and other investment frauds. When not flogging carbon credits the gang was selling fine wine investments through Blakeney Bridge Wine, which was also liquidated.</p>
      <p>The bottles were marked up by almost 300%.</p>
      <p>Also shut down was Earthsky Limited, Savi IT Limited and KMD Energy Solutions.</p>
      <p>The director of KMD was Kerstin Dalgleish, and the court was told that the Government's Company Investigations unit believes this is the real name of the Kirsty Green who fleeced the Speeds.</p>
      <p>Hidden in the background of this operation were two companies based in the British Virgin Islands that were also shut down - WK Investments Holdings Limited and Consolidated Carbon Projects Limited.</p>
      <p>The scam raked in about £4million.</p>
      <p>Update 14/4/16.</p>
      <p>Hollie Chapman of World Future Limited has been banned from being a director for 12 years.</p>
      <p>According to the Insolvency Service, she was a patsy director and her "willing inaction" allowed two unnamed individuals, who were neither directors nor shareholders, to control the company.</p>
      <p>About her only action as sole supposed director was to open a company bank account.</p>
