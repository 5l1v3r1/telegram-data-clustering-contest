      <h1>Cullercoats Beach hit with 'poor' water quality rating AGAIN</h1>
      <h2>Cullercoats is the only beach in the region not rated good or excellent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:40:40+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Herbert Soden</a></address>
      <p>Cullercoats Beach has once again been slapped with a "poor" rating for water quality making it the only beach in the region not classed as "good" or "excellent".</p>
      <p>Despite this, more North East bathing waters than ever before have been rated ‘excellent' in the latest classifications announced today by Defra.</p>
      <p>For the second year running, 33 of the region's 34 designated bathing waters have achieved either ‘excellent' or ‘good' ratings, with the number achieving the highest categorisation rising from 24 to 25.</p>
      <p>A further eight are ‘good', while work continues at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cullercoats">Cullercoats,</a> to identify and remedy the causes of it being rated ‘poor', the only bathing water not to pass the standards.</p>
      <p>A joint investigation between the Environment Agency, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-council">North Tyneside Council</a> and Northumbrian Water, regarding the deterioration of bathing water quality at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cullercoats">Cullercoats</a> , continues.</p>
      <p>Northumbrian Water's waste water director, Richard Warneford, said: "The investigation continues to rule out potential factors that may be contributing to the reduction in quality of the bathing water at Cullercoats.</p>
      <p>"The Environment Agency has continued testing outside of the normal bathing water season, and while the work is ongoing by North Tyneside Council, the Agency and ourselves, there is some optimism that improvements can be delivered.</p>
      <p>"These joint investigations and work will continue until we are able to identify and remedy the cause or causes.</p>
      <p>"Since work began in late 2017, we have identified and carried out proactive measures on a number of third party sites, as well as on parts of our network, to help protect against potential future problems and harm to the local environment."</p>
      <p>Compliance is based on the current and previous four years of sample data (a maximum of 80 samples per beach, from 2016 to 2019).</p>
      <p>The samples are taken by the Environment Agency between May and September each year to assess the bathing waters against the strict regulations.</p>
      <p>Mr Warneford said: "Once again, we have seen 33 of our region's 34 designated bathing waters rated ‘Excellent' or ‘Good' but we have also seen an improvement across the board, with more of these hitting that top classification for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>"This is down to work by a wide range of partners, including the Environment Agency, local authorities and community interest groups, as well as more than two decades of investment by ourselves that has contributed to rising standards.</p>
      <p>"Our work to enhance areas of our network, such as storm water storage facilities, and diverting surface water away from sewers through the introduction of sustainable drainage solutions, will have had played their part in delivering these results and a safer, more enjoyable, bathing environment. We will continue to work with all relevant partners to investigate how we can continue to improve all of our region's bathing waters."</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency publishes information about water quality at England's bathing waters on their online bathing water data explorer, which can be found at www.gov.uk/quality-of-local-bathing-water.</p>
