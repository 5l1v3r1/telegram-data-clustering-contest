      <p>Houston rapper-turned-investor <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.45443/title.chamillionaire-preaches-power-of-tech-to-high-schoolers">Chamillionaire</a> and Bay Area legend <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51175/title.wack-100-calls-out-e-40-in-angry-instagram-rant-i-dont-fuck-wit-you">E-40</a> announced a contest geared towards investing $100,000 into minority and female-owned tech startups.</p>

      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.37548/title.chamillionaire-applauds-j-k-rowlings-use-of-ridin">Chamillionaire</a> was forced to change his strategy on what ventures to invest in after he starting receiving way too many submissions.</p>
      <p>“At one point I was getting 30 candidates a month, but when I said I only wanted to invest in women or minorities, I started getting just two candidates a month,” he stated. “Being an entrepreneur isn’t easy, but it’s even harder for minority and women-led companies.”</p>
      <p>Since winning a Grammy for “Ridin’ Dirty,” Chamillionaire has spent the past few years investing in the <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.45443/title.chamillionaire-preaches-power-of-tech-to-high-schoolers">tech world.</a> He was an early investor in the ride-sharing app Lyft, along with 40 more startups such as Ring (acquired by Amazon), Cruise (acquired by GM) and Maker Studios (acquired by Disney).</p>
      <p>Contest details are available above.</p>
