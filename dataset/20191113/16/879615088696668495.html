      <p><b>Wilhelmina Is Not Renewing Bill Wackermann’s Contract (<a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/12/wilhelmina-models-not-renewing-ceo-bill-wackermanns-contract/">Page Six</a>)</b><br/>Starting in January, Bill Wackermann will be Wilhelmina’s CEO in an “at will” capacity. The agency’s board decided not to renew his contract. “We strive to change the industry and set the standard for professionalism, accountability, and protection of our talent. Over the past six months, that has meant getting rid of some bad apples … and a few rotten ones,” Wackermann told <i>Page Six</i>. “These strategic decisions have not slowed us down or played a role in my and the [board’s] mutual decision to move from a contract to an at-will employment agreement. This is standard executive practice after what has been multiple contract renewals and four incredible years of growth, success, and business development.”</p>

      <p><b>Can Gen Z Save the American Mall? (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/gen-z-will-head-to-brick-and-mortar-stores-this-holiday-season.html?utm_source=Vogue+Business&amp;utm_campaign=b21a963737-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_11_11_10_17&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5d1e7914df-b21a963737-57231811">CNBC</a>)</b><br/>According to a new survey by The NPD Group, Gen Z is less likely to shop online this holiday season than Millennials or Gen X. This is thought to be because they are less likely to have credit cards (Gen Z is mostly comprised of teens) and funds in general. Additionally, they see shopping as an experience. “College students are coming home, and now they have the opportunity to shop with either family or friends,” says Marshal Cohen, chief industry advisor of NPD. He notes that malls are still places to get food and hang out. “The mall isn’t just about shopping.”</p>
