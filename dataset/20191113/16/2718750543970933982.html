      <h1>Give Robert Pattinson a Ballet Movie, You Cowards!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:24:42+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Hunter Harris</a></address>
      <p>The supreme pairing of <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/actors/jennifer-lopez-robert-pattinson-batman-hustlers-the-lighthouse-1203402753/"><i>Variety</i></a>’s Actors-on-Actors interviews has arrived: Jennifer Lopez and Robert Pattinson sat down for a half-hour chat, and the results are, as one would guess, divine. She’s talking about playing a mama-bear stripper in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/hustlers-movie-review-jennifer-lopez-is-a-star.html"><i>Hustlers</i></a>; he’s talking about wearing a mustache and fucking a mermaid in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/the-lighthouse-movie-review-robert-eggers.html"><i>The Lighthouse</i></a><i> </i>— and just when it seems like sensory overload, Pattinson reveals a passion project he spent years chasing. “Something I was trying to find for years was to do a ballet movie,” he says. Hollywood, stop messing around and give Pattinson a ballet movie, you cowards! Witness the full exchange below:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Pattinson:</b> Something I was trying to find for years was to do a ballet movie. And then my agent was like, “Why? Do you know how to ballet?” I’m like, “No.” <br/><br/><b>Lopez:</b> But why? Why, Bobby, tell us?! Is there something fascinating to you about the world of being a male ballet dancer? <br/><br/><b>Pattinson: </b>I think there’s a ballerina inside me. <br/><br/><b>Lopez:</b> Yeah, there’s a ballerina in there. It’s the dance. </blockquote>
      <p>There are so many things to parse here: Jennifer Lopez calling Robert Pattinson “Bobby.” Robert Pattinson revealing there’s a ballerina inside him. Noted dancer Jennifer Lopez agreeing. Get this man on a bar, stat! </p>
