      <h1>See Apple’s new 16-inch MacBook Pro design up close with augmented reality</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:36:56+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>To help customers visualize what the 16-inch MacBook Pro will look and feel like, Apple has an augmented reality tool to place the new notebook on your desk or workspace.</p>
      <p>Apple has used an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/06/mac-pro-iphone-wallpaper/">AR visualizer tool like this before</a> with the announcement of the Mac Pro back in June. Notably, that made it easy to create some slick iPhone wallpapers in addition to getting a better feel for the size of the Mac Pro.</p>
      <p>Along with the physical footprint change and display size change from the 15- to 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has the AR visualizer tool available again.</p>
      <p>To use it, grab your iPhone or iPad and head to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">this webpage</a>. Swipe down a bit and look for “See MacBook Pro in AR.”</p>
      <p>Once you’ve loaded the AR notebook, you can pinch to zoom (up to 1,000%+), use two fingers to spin it around, and more. There’s also the option to view it in object or AR mode.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it looks:</p>
