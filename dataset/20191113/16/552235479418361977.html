      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:25:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author">Kilmarnock Standard, Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/kilmarnock-standard/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock’s</a> Palace Theatre complex should not close for an entire year to allow repair work, a meeting heard.</p>
      <p>A councillor called for a phased approach to refurbishment and maintenance, which will cost between £6 million to £8m.</p>
      <p>An East Ayrshire Council cabinet meeting heard cash has been poured into the building over the years but <br/>major work is still needed, as reported in last week’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock Standard</a>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Problems include water penetrating the historic building and a new drainage system is to be installed.</p>
      <p>Politicians were told the size of the downpipes cannot cope with levels of water and marble at the base of the iconic structure is adding to problems.</p>
      <p>Council leader Douglas Reid said he is “disappointed” that despite significant sums of money being spent the issues remain.</p>
      <p>Councillor Jim Roberts said: “We are highlighting there is a problem. We are addressing it.”</p>
      <p>Concerns were raised about the popular grade A-listed venue losing money during any closure.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The theatre and Grand Hall have attracted huge names over the years including Kasabian, Calvin Harris, Kevin Bridges and Billy Connolly.</p>
      <p>Urging caution over a lengthy shutdown, Councillor Tom Cook said: “I am concerned about closing the whole place for a year. We would lose the income for the year. Could we phase it?”</p>
      <p>Depute council leader Elena Whitham agreed that closing it would affect revenue.</p>
      <p>She pointed out there is a also a programme of scheduled events which must be considered.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The meeting heard there will be further reports on the matter.</p>
      <p>The Palace Theatre was originally a corn exchange in 1863 but was converted into a theatre in 1903.</p>
      <p>The council is planning to set aside £5 million to help cover costs to preserve the landmark while the East Ayrshire Leisure Trust will seek grant funding.</p>
