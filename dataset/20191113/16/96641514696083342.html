      <h1>Amazon orders William Gibson series from the creators of 'Westworld'</h1>
      <h2>Sci-fi thriller 'The Peripheral' is coming to Prime Video</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:45:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/27/amazon-the-expanse-season-5/">push into sci-fi</a> increasingly entails some of the biggest names in the business, both on-screen and off. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/17/amazon-william-gibson-the-peripheral-series/">months of waiting</a>, Amazon has <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy-the-peripheral-picked-up-series-amazon-1202784694/">ordered</a> a Prime Video series adaptation of William Gibson's sci-fi novel <i>The Peripheral</i> that will be executive produced by <i>Westworld</i> creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan (shown above) as well as <i>A Simple Plan</i>'s Scott Smith. The mystery/thriller hybrid revolves around a woman struggling to deal with a broken family until she witnesses what she think might be a horrific murder. After that, the future "comes calling for her" -- or rather, futures.</p>
      <p>The series has been in development at Amazon since early 2018, but it's only now getting the go-ahead. Joy and Nolan both signed a larger deal with Amazon in April. Other executive producers include <i>Westworld</i>'s Athena Wickham as well as <i>In the Tall Grass</i> veterans Steven Hoban and Vincenzo Natali.</p>
      <p>This isn't the <i>Neuromancer</i> show you might have hoped for, and there are numerous unknowns like the cast or release date. The combination of Gibson and <i>Westworld</i> alumni is still promising. If nothing else, it suggests the Amazon series will tackle Gibson's world building and idea-driven storytelling with some degree of seriousness.</p>
