      <p><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/11/21/shoppers-scan-and-shop-loblaws-self-checkout-app/">Loblaws</a> has announced plans to invest in its PC Express service by building an “automated picking facility” at one of its locations.</p>
      <p>The company will partner with Takeoff Technologies to enable the PC Express service to provide online grocery orders to customers faster and more accurately through the automated warehouse.</p>
      <p>The service will launch in 2020 and will include technology that will have the ability to support PC Express orders in select stores that are near the automated picking facility.</p>
      <p>Construction has begun at one of the GTA  locations, where the company will install a 12,000 square foot picking facility within the store.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it will work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customers order as usual through PC Express</li>
        <li>At the automated picking facility, once an order is received it may be split by automated picking and/or in-store picking, depending on the products requested. Instead of walking the store to pick groceries, our automated facility brings groceries directly to a Loblaws colleague to pick and pack.</li>
        <li>Once complete, the order goes to a ‘staging area’ where another Loblaws colleague reviews the order and stores it in the appropriate temperature zone (frozen, chilled or, room temperature). The order is then combined with the in-store picked items if necessary.</li>
        <li>Customers arrive and their order is brought out to their car.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Loblaws currently has 700 PC Express pick up locations at transit stations, pharmacies and grocery stores across the country.</p>
