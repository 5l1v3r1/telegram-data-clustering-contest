      <p>I've started so I'll finish....the legendary <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC</a> quiz show will soon starting the casting process for its next run of episodes and is keen to hear from people in the Newcastle area who think they can impress with their knowledge in the famous black chair.</p>
      <p>Hat Trick/Hindsight Productions, who make the show told Chronicle Live: "We are looking to cast a diverse range of people with all levels of quizzing experience throughout the whole of the UK.</p>
      <p>You do need some general knowledge, but we’re really interested in your three specialist subjects – the wider the range the better.</p>
      <p>"Anyone can apply as long you are aged 18 or over and are a resident of the UK including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man."</p>
      <p>To apply, just email  <a href="mailto:mastermind.hth@hattrick.comk">mastermind.hth@hattrick.com</a>  for an application form. It’s a short application and the sooner it’s completed the sooner producers can get in touch.</p>
      <p>After submission, one of the casting team may call you for to invite you to audition. <b> </b> If you can’t make the audition don’t worry, they offer Skype auditions too.</p>
      <p>Auditions only take a couple of hours and involve a little ice breaker game, then have a chat on camera – easy!</p>
      <p>This series will be filmed in Belfast so if you are cast on the show, you'll be flown over to Northern Island to film.</p>
