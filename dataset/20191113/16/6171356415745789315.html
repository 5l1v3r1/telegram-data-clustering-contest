      <h1>(Update: Fix coming) Pixel 4 Snapchat, Instagram videos plagued by maddening 'clicking' sounds</h1>

      </p>
      <p>At launch, no Pixel is without its issues, and the most recent problem might sound a bit familiar for those of you that remember the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/11/07/pixel-2-units-making-clicking-high-pitched-sounds/">Pixel 2</a>. A minority of Pixel 4 owners are experiencing what is alternately described as a popping, clicking, or tapping sound in videos recorded through third-party apps like Snapchat and Instagram. Not all units appear to be affected (we have inconsistent experiences with it in-house), but based on the example below, it seems like it could be pretty annoying.</p>

        <i>Demonstration videos (by <a href="https://twitter.com/604kev">@604kev</a>) recorded in the stock Google Camera app (left) and Instagram (right). Notice the regular "tapping" or "clicking" in the Instagram video.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The issue manifests as you can hear above, with video recorded on the Pixel 4 through at least some third-party apps exhibiting a rhythmic clicking or tapping noise, sort of like a scratched LP being played. Note that not all methods of recording video are affected. The issue occurs with third-party apps like Snapchat and Instagram, as well as in the AR-augmented Playground mode of Google Camera, but videos recorded in the stock camera app's normal "video" mode are unaffected.</p>
      <p>Another example with ongoing audio is just below:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We've been able to confirm the issue is present on at least one device around the Android Police digital offices, and it's possible that loud or continuous sounds exaggerate the issue, based on our tests.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the volume of reports related to the issue is fairly low (by our standards), with only a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4/comments/dofxhi/clicking_noise_on_snapchat/">handful</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4/comments/dn340h/popping_sounds_recording_audo_in_some_apps/">reports</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dnv0n7/popping_on_instagram_stories_pixel_4/">outside</a> a larger thread at the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17544166?hl=en">Google support forums</a>. We aren't sure if that's due to the variety of ways the issue could be described, the fact that it only seems to happen with video recorded in third-party apps, if there's a lack of overlapping demographics, or if not all Pixel 4s are affected. Whatever the explanation, the examples make it clear that this is a genuine (and annoying) issue for those that have it.</p>

        <i>Ambient noise might exaggerate the issue (as demonstrated above). Note the same issues don't occur in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bgo-QQAEcA">Google Camera</a>, even with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ivUZsZygJM">strong background noise</a>.</i>

      <p>In the meantime, a product expert on Google's product forums has <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17544166?msgid=17695910">escalated the issue</a>, and those affected are invited to send feedback through the Google Camera and Settings apps.</p>

        <p>It isn't clear if the fix, which is expected to roll out "in the coming days," will happen via the affected apps or an update to the phones themselves, but it should happen eventually. We should note, one of our affected tipsters still suffers the same problem on the latest version of the Instagram app.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Google encourages those affected by the problem to record content via the main camera <i>first</i>, and then separately upload it to the social media app or site in question.</p>
        <p>End of Update</p>
