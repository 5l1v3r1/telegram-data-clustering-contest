      <p>The singer-songwriter is set to perform at the Ace Hotel in LA on December 10, 11 and at BAM’s Harvey Theatre in Brooklyn on the 17 and 18.</p>
      <p>Blake is also set to perform at Lollapalooza in Chile, Argentina and Brazil next March and April, before he hits the road for a European tour. No UK dates have been announced yet.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Blake released his fourth studio album <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/james-blake-assume-form-album-review">‘Assume Form</a>‘. <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/james-blake-assume-form-album-review">In a five-star review of the LP</a>, NME described it as: “Proof that James Blake is one of the world’s greatest producers, this loved-up fourth record, featuring Andre 3000 and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/travis-scott">Travis Scott</a>, sees him finally in control as a brilliant songwriter and emotive lyricist.”</p>

      <p>Last month, he also confirmed that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/james-blake-teases-new-song-youre-too-precious-music-2554427">he has new music on the way – including a song titled ‘You’re Too Precious’</a>. “I don’t know the [release] date yet,” Blake said. “But I just wanna release it soon. It’s just, you know, it’s a matter of how it’s released. I just gotta figure that out first.” </p>
      <p>He also recently opened up about his <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/didnt-want-live-james-blake-discusses-mental-health-battles-new-essay-2556230">own mental health battles in a new essay</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was asking questions like ‘What is the point of me?’ and saying I didn’t want to live. I became afraid of the growing fog of war outside my house because of what I knew people expected of me if I entered it: a normal interaction and, even more impossible, a new album,” Blake explained.</p>
