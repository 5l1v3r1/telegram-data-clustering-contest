      <h1>Family of Dead Los Zetas Gunman Seeks Donations for Burial</h1>
      <h2>MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon – The family of a recently killed gunman for Los Zetas is holding local fundraisers to cover his burial expenses. The assassin’s body remains in another state where he took part in a failed ambush on law enforcement.</h2>

      <p>Relatives of a member of the Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) faction of Los Zetas known as “Chikilin” are sharing a series of messages on social media advertising the sale of food items. The family is offering containers of tripe soup known as menudo for $200 pesos ($10 USD) to raise the needed funds to move his body from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon to Nuevo Laredo for a proper burial. Relatives also advertised they would be asking for donations along the main avenues of Nuevo Laredo.</p>

      <p>The gunman was a member of the CDN-Zetas armed wing called “Tropa Del Infierno” or “Hell’s Troops” who <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/11/07/mexican-cartel-ambushes-wounded-cops-after-border-state-shootout/">died last week when the organization tried to ambush state police officers</a> and then targeted their wounded in transit to hospitals. <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/09/12/cartel-connected-human-rights-group-alleges-police-brutality-in-border-city-near-texas/">Despite the criminal organization’s reputation for brutality, “human rights” activists in Nuevo Laredo continue to critique the police officers who combat the cartel</a>.</p>

      <p>The lack of funding for a burial demonstrates the stark contrast with the perceived life of luxury <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/11/05/mexican-cartels-are-winning-the-propaganda-war/">portrayed in popular culture</a> about the narco-lifestyle. The CDN faction of Los Zetas is the leading criminal organization in Nuevo Laredo where it controls drug trafficking, human smuggling, fuel theft, and commercial extortion schemes.</p>
