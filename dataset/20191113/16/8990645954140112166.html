      <p>Buckley Sachs, a regular performer at Backdoor Theater for many years, was one of three people killed in a car wreck in Denton last week.</p>
      <p>The wreck happened Friday on Interstate 35W, involving several cars and two 18-wheelers. One of the trucks in the wreck was carrying liquefied petroleum gas and exploded. According to the <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/article237255874.html">Fort Worth Star Telegram</a>, police are still investigating the cause of the wreck.</p>
      <p>59-year-old Sachs, who had been living in Fort Worth, was officially identified Monday as one of the three to lose their lives in the wreck, succumbing to smoke inhalation and thermal burns. Jennifer Kara Ferguson, 30, of Fort Worth; and Ann Marie Cole, 63, of Denton both died from blunt-force trauma.</p>
      <p>News of Sachs' passing spread through his friends over the weekend, with many posting loving tributes and messages on his Facebook page.</p>
      <p>I had the honor and pleasure of working with Buckley on two dinner-stage shows for Backdoor right after high school, appearing in one show together and being directed by him in the 1999 Christmas show. With the positive nature Buckley maintained during the whole experience, that Christmas show is one of my fondest memories of working at Backdoor.</p>
      <p>Rest in peace Buckley.</p>
