      <p>Fans finally know the man who will inspire Halle Bailey's Ariel to give up her voice and leave her life under the sea. Deadline reported on Tuesday, Nov. 12, that <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/little-mermaid-jonah-hauer-king-wins-roles-of-prince-eric-1202784503/">Jonah Hauer-King was cast as Prince Eric</a> in <i>The Little Mermaid</i> live-action remake. Disney has not yet confirmed the news, but fans are already embracing Hauer-King as the next Disney heartthrob.</p>
      <p>Hauer-King was first rumored to be in the running for <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/09/the-little-mermaid-prince-eric-cameron-cuffe-jonah-hauer-king-testing-role-1202743642/">Prince Eric in <i>The Little Mermaid</i> movie</a> after Harry Styles turned down the role in September. And, after a round of screen tests, as reported by <i>Variety</i>, it looks like the British actor has won the role. (Bustle reached out to representatives of Disney and Hauer-King for confirmation, but has not yet heard back.)</p>
      <p>Like Bailey, Hauer-King is a relative newcomer to Hollywood. His first <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5999355/">credit on his IMDb page</a> is from 2014. But in these past five years, he's stacked up an impressive list of projects, including several period pieces fit for a prince. He starred in the 2017 <i>Howard's End</i> miniseries where he portrayed Paul Wilcox opposite Hayley Atwell and Matthew Macfadyen. He also recently played Laurie in the BBC miniseries of <i>Little Women</i> in 2017 — where he showed off his American accent and, in hindsight, appropriately posed by the sea for an Instagram shot.</p>

      <p>For American audiences, Hauer-King may be best known for portraying Lucas in 2019's <i>A Dog's Way Home</i>. But his Instagram page should allow people not familiar with his work to get to know him a little bit better. As his previous posts show, he's no stranger to the movie musical, having shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLqbjSPlm1E/">his admiration for <i>La La Land</i></a> on Instagram, calling it "amazing." He's also a musician — like Prince Eric. But rather than wistfully play the flute, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BX-7RZKBD-D/">Hauer-King plays guitar</a>. As for his singing voice, a 2017 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzOOyCfvhCw&amp;feature=youtu.be">performance of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah"</a> shared on YouTube shows he's got what it takes to keep up with Ariel.</p>
      <p>Fans might not recognize his name, but they're already fully on board with the casting, gushing over his striking resemblance to the cartoon Prince.</p>

Who knows, he might even inspire a few to make a deal with a sea witch themselves.</p>
