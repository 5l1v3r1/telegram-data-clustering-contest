      <p><b>MONROE, La. (KNOE) - </b>The City of Monroe is holding a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Monroe on Monday, Nov. 18 and the public is invited to attend.</p>
      <p>Along with the Monroe tree lighting, there will be a special treat this year: the tree that will be on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol building will be at the ceremony. The tree is from Carson National Forest in New Mexico and is on a cross-country trip to Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>The Monroe tree lighting ceremony will be from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Monroe Civic Center and will include Christmas songs featuring the J.S. Clark Elementary School Choir and hot chocolate &amp; cookies.</p>
      <p>Holiday characters will also be on hand, provided by KNOE, and there will be a special appearance by Santa Claus.</p>
      <p>The city says the first 500 visitors will receive a free Christmas ornament.</p>
      <p>The event is free to attend.</p>
