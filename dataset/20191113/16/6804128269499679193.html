      <h1>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sends Instagram message to Arsenal fans after previous dig at critics</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal striker had hit back at criticism earlier in the week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:39:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has shared a video of Arsenal supporters singing his name at Leicester's King Power Stadium.</p>
      <p>The clip was filmed by a fan in the concourse during the Gunners' 2-0 defeat to Brendan Rodgers' side on Saturday, and Aubameyang re-posted the video on his Instagram account amid reports that his <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> teammates and fans are concerned about his social media activity.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://theathletic.com/1361874/2019/11/11/ornstein-on-monday-doubts-over-aubameyang-captaincy-new-keeper-for-west-ham-and-fall-of-a-giant-poppy/">The Athletic,</a> the decision to award the striker the captaincy was not an universally popular one with everyone at the north London club.</p>
      <p>The former Dortmund forward is good friends with AFTV - formerly known as Arsenal Fan TV - contributor 'Troopz', and the Gabon international has invited the YouTube star to watch Arsenal games from the comfort of his executive box at the Emirates on several occasions.</p>
      <p>But the report claims certain figures at the club are said to be 'irritated' by this, and Aubameyang has reportedly been asked to stop engaging with Troopz, after liking several of his posts calling for Arsenal to sack Unai Emery and sell Granit Xhaka.</p>

      <p>Taking to social media earlier in the week, Aubameyang posted a picture on his Instagram story after arriving for international duty.</p>
      <p>He wrote: 'I just arrived in Gabon and heared a lot of bull... I talk with who I want and if somebody's not happy with... you already know,' followed with an emoji of a hand with the middle finger gesture.</p>
      <p>But on Wednesday, the forward appeared to show his appreciation for Arsenal supporters by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aubameyang97/">reposting the video</a> of fans singing his name.</p>
      <p>The striker is currently on international duty with Gabon, and is set to face DR Congo and Angola before returning to London to prepare for the Gunners' home clash against Southampton.</p>
