      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA - The leadership of the Concern Voters Movement (CVM) is urging the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and President Akufo-Addo to discontinue the campaign for a YES VOTE in the upcoming Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chiefs Executives (MMDCEs) Referendum on December 17.</p>
      <p>It said all members of the NPP should campaign and vote against the Election of MMDCEs since National Democratic Congress (NDC) has failed to support such a laudable policy.</p>
      <p>A statement signed by Mr Razak Kojo Opoku, CVM Founder and President and copied to the Ghana NEWS agency on Wednesday said, though it was a campaign promise to the good people of Ghana, there was the need to admit that such a policy required Constitutional amendments unlike other campaign promises.</p>
      <p>"We need two-third majority in Parliament to amend Article 243(1) of the Constitution and about 74 per cent of the total valid votes cast during the referendum to pave way for the amendment to the Article 55(3) of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>"First, we need to understand that Majority in Parliament would need the support of Minority to reach the two-third majority to amend Article 243(1) to pave the way for election of MMDCEs. Again whether the election of MMDCEs should be partisan or non-partisan, the policy would require the support of Ghanaians through a referendum".</p>
      <p>The statement however said that the betrayal of the NDC and its Minority in Parliament would be a clear sabotage to this referendum exercise, adding that, there was no way we could achieve the YES VOTE since the NDC are advocatingÂ  a NO VOTE, and this exercise demands full Inter-Party Consensus especially from the two leading Political Parties.</p>
      <p>It said if, NO vote wins on December 17, Referendum, it would create suicidal tendencies for the NPP ahead of the 2020 General Election, which would give some political audacity to the 2020 campaign of the NDC.</p>
      <p>The statement urged the NPP to avoid the political risk factors associated with the election of MMDCEs.</p>
      <p>It said the NPP and Government needed to officially boycott the MMDCEs Referendum and shoot down the amendment process for Article 243(1) in Parliament.</p>
      <p>It said the NPP should allow the National Commission on Civic Education, the Institute of Democratic Governance, Centre of Democratic Development, and NDC to cause political misfortunes for the New Patriotic Party.</p>
      <p>It said: "CVM is totally against election of MMDCEs largely due to the "political stance" of the NDC.</p>
