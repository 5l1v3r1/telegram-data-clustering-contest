      <p>The Punjab government on Wednesday announced Rs 2,500 per acre as compensation to small and marginal farmers who did not burn crop residue.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/stubble-burning">Stubble burning </a>in Punjab and Haryana is a cause of air pollution in Delhi and governments of both states are taking several steps to check the practice.</p>
      <p>Farmers cultivating non-basmati paddy and owning land up to five acres will get Rs 2,500 per acre compensation for not burning stubble, said secretary, agriculture department, Kahan Singh Pannu.</p>
      <p>To seek the compensation, farmers have to submit a self-declaration proforma with the panchayat concerned by November 30 for claiming compensation, he said.</p>
      <p>The proforma is available with village panchayats. The compensation amount would be directly credited to the bank account of the eligible farmer, said Pannu in an official statement here.</p>
      <p>Pannu also appealed to the farmers not to burn paddy residue as it was the blatant violation of the orders of the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>He also warned of strict action to be initiated against those farmers violating the ban on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/stubble-burning">stubble burning.</a></p>
      <p>Farmers in Punjab continued to defy ban on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/stubble-burning">stubble burning </a>with the state witnessing more than 48,000 incidents of farm fires this year.</p>
      <p>Farmers, particularly small ones, have been claiming that it was not financially viable for them to buy farm machinery for the management of paddy residue.</p>
      <p>They have also been claiming Rs 200 per quintal as compensation for management of stubble.</p>
