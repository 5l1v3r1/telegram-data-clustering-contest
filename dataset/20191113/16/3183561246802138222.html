      <p>Astronomers have uncovered a star leaving the galaxy at an extremely fast pace. They also found out <i>why</i>. Turns out, it was unceremoniously booted out by The Milky Way's supermassive black hole.</p>
      <p>The star, called S5-HVS1, was found to be travelling at around six million kilometres per hour or 1700 kilometres per second, <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/star-discovered-whizzing-out-of-the-galaxy-at-over-1700-kilometres-every-second/">BBC Science Focus reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The astronomers, from Carnegie Mellon University and University of Oxford, came across the discovery during a Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey. "The velocity of the discovered star is so high that it will inevitably leave the Galaxy and never return," Douglas Boubert, a co-author on the paper, said.</p>
      <p>S5-HVS1's origins were traced back to the middle of The Milky Way where Sagittarius A*, a mean-looking supermassive black hole, is situated. It's about four million times the mass of our sun, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/multimedia/black-hole-SagittariusA.html">according to NASA</a>, so it's certainly a big guy.</p>
      <p>"We think the black hole ejected the star with a speed of thousands of kilometres per second about five million years ago," the star's discoverer, Sergey Koposov, said. "This ejection happened at the time when humanityâ€™s ancestors were just learning to walk on two feet."</p>
      <p>It's believed the star got too close to Sagittarius A* and it did what black holes tend to do, absorbed it and ejected that straying star the hell outta there. Now, five million years or so after that drama, S5-HVS1 has been spotted in the Grus constellation, around 29,000 light years from Earth.</p>
      <p>It was reportedly spotted by the <a href="https://www.aao.gov.au/about-us/anglo-australian-telescope">Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT)</a> at the Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran in New South Wales.</p>
