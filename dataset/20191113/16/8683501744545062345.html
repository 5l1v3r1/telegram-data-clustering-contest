      <p>The push to raise awareness for the Snyder Cut of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484508/zack-snyder-shows-the-flash-traveling-through-time-in-new-justice-league-snyder-cut-photo"><i>Justice League</i></a> reaches new intensity every day. And original <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464489/justice-league"><i>Justice League</i></a> director Zack Snyder continues to play along on social media, following a schedule laid out by the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut team. They have designated each day this week as a tribute to the individual members of the League. Today is “Cyborg Day,” prompting Zack Snyder to share this image from a deleted scene from his Snyder Cut of <i>Justice League</i>:</p>

      <p>Using the caption “Defending the father,” Zack Snyder seems to be showing off a scene in which the villain Steppenwolf invades S.T.A.R. Labs with the intention of finding the last Motherbox. This scene was referenced in the dialogue that I actually watched Zack Snyder film on the UK set of <i>Justice League</i> back in 2016. The League was meeting with Alfred in the rooftop when Victor Stone (Ray Fisher) emerged from the shadows to tell them about the attack on the lab. We never saw that scene in the theatrical cut.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to figure out which character was brutalized the most when it comes to the significant differences between <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different">Zack Snyder’s planned cut of <i>Justice League</i></a> and the theatrical version that fans got on November 17, 2017. I’d still argue that Superman (Henry Cavill) absorbed the brunt of the edits, though details we have learned just this week, alone, show that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483465/justice-league-composer-confirms-the-snyder-cut-of-the-score">The Flash</a> (Ezra Miller) and Diana (Gal Gadot) had important scenes cut or reworked.</p>
      <p>Then there is Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), whose <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471122/justice-leagues-ray-fisher-wishes-his-characters-backstory-was-more-fully-represented?pv=search">origin story</a> is tied directly to the Motherboxes and was drastically reduced for the theatrical cut of <i>Justice League</i>. His treatment in the movie has fans up in arms, also because Fisher has been such a vocal supporter of Zack Snyder over the years.</p>

      <p>Again, I need to point out that the fact that Zack Snyder is playing along with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484404/why-this-could-be-a-huge-week-for-justice-leagues-release-the-snyder-cut-movement">this week’s #ReleaseTheSnyderCut activities</a> means that he is in full support of the vocal movement to convince Warner Bros. to release his director’s cut of the movie, in some fashion. Fans likely want a theatrical release of the cut, which seems to be finished. They also are lobbying for a DVD or Blu-ray release, though a dump onto HBO Max seems more feasible (and would have to be viewed as a win, in this scenario).</p>
      <p>Will it work? This all remains to be seen. The schedule for the rest of the week is supposed to focus on <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484345/aquaman-stabs-steppenwolf-in-badass-snyder-cut-look-shared-by-jason-momoa">Aquaman</a> (Jason Momoa) on Thursday, and Batman (Ben Affleck) on Friday. Then, there are <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484238/all-the-superman-movies-ranked">plans in effect</a> for Sunday, November 17, which will be the two-year anniversary of the theatrical release of <i>Justice League</i>.</p>
      <p>Is the studio paying attention? We don’t know. But <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a> certainly is paying attention, and playing along. And that says more than you could ever imagine.</p>
