      <p>Hundreds of people welcomed the Children in Need Rickshaw Challenge to Nottingham when the team arrived at the Boots headquarters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The annual challenge, now in its ninth year, includes a team of six young people and Matt Baker, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bbc">BBC</a>'s The One Show taking on an eight-day, 400 mile cycling challenge from Holyhead to London.</p>
      <p>The cyclists travelled through Nottingham on Wednesday, November 13, between noon and 2pm.</p>
      <p>The team passed through Brian Clough Way, University Boulevard, Maid Marian Way, Statue and London Road before arriving at the Boots site in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/beeston">Beeston</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the past 16 years, Boots UK has raised £12.7 million for Children in Need to help change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people across the country.</p>
      <p>This year money raised by Boots will fund projects that champion mental wellbeing, build confidence and resilience, and encourage children and young people to reach their full potential.</p>
      <p>Una Kent, director of communications and CSR, Boots UK, said: “BBC Children in Need is a cause that is close to everybody’s hearts here at Boots and for the very first time in our sixteen year partnership, we are delighted to welcome The One Show’s Rickshaw Challenge to our home town of Nottingham.</p>
      <p>"The children taking part in this challenge are utterly inspiring and hundreds and hundreds of our Support Office colleagues came out in force to celebrate their remarkable achievement.</p>
      <p>"What a wonderful way to inspire and make a difference to children and young people across the UK.”</p>

      <p>The full route started in Holyhead on Friday, November 8 and the team travelled across Wales for three days before arriving in Oswestry, England.</p>
      <p>They are now making their way down to the finish line at BBC Elstree Studios where they are expected to arrive on Friday, November 15 for the BBC <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/charities">Children in Need</a> Appeal Show.</p>
      <p>Since 2011, The Rickshaw Challenge has raised more than £25 million for BBC Children in Need, with donations going on to make a difference to the lives of children and young people across the UK.</p>
      <p>One of the six youngsters taking part in the 400-mile challenge is Emma from Nottingham - the charity has not given her surname.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old was born with a severe liver disease that resulted in her needing to undergo two liver transplants and spent a lot of her childhood in hospital.</p>
      <p>Emma started swimming and in 2015 represented Team GB at the World Transplant Games, taking home several medals.</p>
      <p>However, in 2017, Emma had a seizure which left her unable to walk, see properly or concentrate for long periods.</p>

      <p>Emma’s sight gradually returned and a year later, following a long process of rehabilitation and physiotherapy, she was able to walk again.</p>
      <p>She said: "It was so amazing getting to cycle the rickshaw through the streets of my hometown, Nottingham. Seeing all the support from local people, along with close friends and family who came and lined the streets to cheer us along was one of the highlights of the challenge so far.<i>"</i></p>
