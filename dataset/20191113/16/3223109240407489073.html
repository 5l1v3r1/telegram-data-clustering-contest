      <h1>‘Dumb’ Matt Damon Still Regrets Losing Massive ‘Avatar’ Payday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:20:18+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>At this point, jokes about how no one remembers anything about <i>Avatar</i> are more memorable than anything actually in <i>Avatar</i>. Despite making nearly $2.8 billion (the highest-grossing movie ever until <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/james-cameron-gives-shoutout-to-marvel-for-beating-avatar-in-box-office-1796978/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> dethroned it this year) when you ask anyone about James Cameron’s sci-fi nature epic they’ll shrug and say, “Alien cat people?”</p>
      <p>Someone who will never forget <i>Avatar</i> though is Matt Damon. The actor is still kicking himself when thinking about how much money he lost by turning down the film’s starring role of…<b>checks notes</b>… Jake Sully. You could say he’s feeling pretty blue.</p>

      <p>While promoting his new movie <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> on BBC, Damon repeated claims he earlier told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/matt-damon-christian-bale-ford-v-ferrari-interview">GQ</a> about his tragic <i>Avatar</i> history that might’ve been. Not only did James Cameron offer him the lead role of Jake Sully, Damon also could’ve received ten percent of the film’s potential profits. If you do the math that’s a $250 million haul Damon didn’t see.</p>
      <p>Now you could say that no one could’ve guessed <i>Avatar</i> would be that ridiculously successful. But remember that Cameron’s previous film was <i>Titanic</i>, which also made record-breaking amount of money. So while Damon calling himself “the worst businessman” and “the dumbest actor alive” is a bit harsh, is it really inaccurate?</p>
      <p>But whatever, Matt Damon is doing fine. He’s certainly a more recognizable movie star than <i>Avatar’s</i> actual lead Sam Worthington (who as far as we know didn’t receive a similar deal). And if Damon really wanted to get in on the <i>Avatar</i> action, he could’ve signed up for one of these endless upcoming sequels. But he didn’t. If you want to refresh your <i>Avatar</i> memory, you can stream the movie now on <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/11-obscure-movies-you-should-watch-on-disney-1809503/">Disney+</a>.</p>
