      <p>Here at Undercard Superstar, we’re in the business of your business! Just follow our sound betting advice, and you too can afford to walk around in a HAZMAT suit 24/7 to avoid being the <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNewYork/status/1194321751880208384">unluckiest</a> person in the world!</p>
      <p>As usual, we’ll take a hundred dollars and divide it among five fights.</p>
      <p>Let’s make some cashola.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Ronaldo Souza +175 over Jan Blachowicz ($10)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Paul Craig +220 over Mauricio Rua ($5)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Douglas Silva de Andrade -260 over Renan Barao ($20)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Lee McGregor +155 over Ukashir Farooq ($15)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Andrew Maloney -2250 over Elton Dharry ($50)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This certainly isn’t the Jacare of old, but Blachowicz isn’t the Blachowicz of old, either, and I was stunned to find him as big of a dog as he is. I think he has enough in the tank to bank a win, here.</p>
      <p>It brings me no joy picking against Shogun, especially on a short-notice opponent, but a +220 line is too juicy against a guy who can get Rua in a submission at a moment’s notice.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Last Week: $ +3.40</b>
        <br/>
        <b>Year To Date: $ -124.91</b>
