      <p>The brother of Simple Minds star Jim Kerr has been found guilty of stalking a superfan who left a negative online review of the band’s latest album.</p>
      <p>Paul Kerr, 55, from Brighton, was accused of threatening to murder John Fagan as part of a vicious campaign of harrassment.</p>
      <p>After a trial at Lewes Crown Court, Kerr was today convicted of of two counts of pursuing a course of conduct that amounted to stalking relating to John and his wife Julie, and another of stalking his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Vanthof.</p>
      <p>A jury was told Kerr had embarked on a terrifying stalking against the couple after they left a negative online review for the band’s album</p>
      <p>Kerr, who denied the charges, threatened to murder "superfan" John and drag his wife to a police station by her hair, his trial heard.</p>

      <p>He was also alleged to have falsely accused John of raping a nine-year-old boy and posting sexually abusive comments against him and his wife on public <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> pages.</p>
      <p>Kerr's famous brother was dragged into the trial as the court heard that Paul had accused Mrs Fagan of sleeping with the star.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook poster paul allegedly wrote: “The whore Julie Fagan who was probably f****d by Jim Kerr on her wedding night because that’s what Kerr does to friends wives of his.</p>

      <p>"Jim probably f****d her on her wedding night.”</p>
      <p>He then allegedly lambasted her husband on Facebook branding him a “coward,</p>
      <p>a rat and a dog.”</p>
      <p>The court heard Kerr had been disowned by his superstar brother and his own father because of his behaviour.</p>
