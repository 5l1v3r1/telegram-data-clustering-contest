      <p>MONTREAL – The debate over Québec Solidaire MNA Catherine Dorion’s clothing has taken a turn.</p>
      <p>The Fédération des femmes du Québec (FFQ) says it is receiving backlash for suggesting that people not only support the #MonCotonouatéMonchoix (my hoodie, my choice) movement, but also #MonVoileMonChoix (my veil, my choice), which supports women who choose to wear the hijab.</p>
      <p>“We said, ‘Hold on a second. You’re willing to support women’s choice and a women’s right to choose what to wear,” said Gabrielle Bouchard, president of the FFQ.</p>
      <p>“Yet on the other hand, you don’t support women’s right to wear a veil or a hijab and you’re willing to throw them under the bus.”</p>
      <p>This comes after <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/campaign-calls-for-women-to-wear-hoodies-to-work-to-support-quebec-solidaire-mna-1.4678593">a campaign was started to support Dorion</a> who, dressed in jeans and a hoodie, was recently refused access to the Salon Bleu of the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>According to Chantal Soucy, vice-president of the National Assembly, <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/mna-who-posted-controversial-photo-denied-access-to-national-assembly-chamber-1.4674554">Dorion was deemed to not be dressed appropriately</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s a question of control of women’s bodies,” Bouchard told CTV News. “This is just one example of how society is controlling women’s bodies and what they can wear.”</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/is-it-suitable-dress-code-discussed-after-mna-wears-t-shirt-jeans-in-national-assembly-1.4208027">the 37-year-old’s clothing have come under fire</a> at the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>Last year, Dorion caused a stir when she spoke to the legislature wearing a t-shirt bearing the name of Franco-Ontarian poet Patrice Desbiens.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The #MonVoileMonChoix initiative was launched by Hanadi Saad, founder of Justice Femme, Amel Zaazaa and Tasnim Rekik. It was most recently used to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/protesters-against-quebec-s-secularism-law-say-they-re-not-giving-up-1.4657818">oppose Quebec’s controversial secularism law</a>.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘Well, it’s cute to support an MNA who couldn’t wear a hoodie, but so is wearing a veil or a button against Bill 21 to support all women and Muslim women,” Bouchard argued.</p>
      <p>“I think there’s a cognitive dissonance into which women are supported and which are not.”</p>
      <p>Not only are women being attacked for their choices, but so are the organizations that protect and defend them, Bouchard insists, adding that some could be <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-immigration-minister-apologizes-for-botched-reform-of-foreign-student-program-1.4681944">taking example from the Quebec government</a>.</p>
      <p>“We have a government that condones hatred, that condones violence and putting laws and regulations into place and throwing immigration files in the garbage,” she told CTV News.</p>
      <p>The FFQ argues that society is only ‘tolerant’ of women’s rights.</p>
      <p>“Going from tolerant to intolerant is done very, very often,” Bouchard said. “We’re not an accepting society. We just tolerate.”</p>
      <p>The FFQ notes the backlash it has received over the decision to vocalize support for all women’s movement only goes to show how much work there is left to do.</p>
