      <h1>UPS and Agritech Firm Use Blockchain to Verify Beef Shipment From US to Japan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:15:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>American logistics giant UPS has successfully delivered a blockchain-verified beef shipment from the United States to Japan. The company partnered with agritech firm HerdX to incorporate its packaging technology into a blockchain network to trace the journey of beef from Kansas to Japan, the firm <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/business/newsfeeds/prnewswire/201911110811PR_NEWS_USPR_____DA32524.html">announced</a> on Nov. 11.</p>
      <p>As announced by UPS, the jointly-delivered shipment involved a blockchain partner network developed by HerdX. Meanwhile, UPS provided its visibility tool that integrates with HerdX's blockchain technology and records live updates, registering details throughout the journey.</p>
      <h3>U.S. Embassy and Japanese officials checked the blockchain-recorded beef</h3>
      <p>The pilot was supported by the United States Embassy in Japan and was announced at a special dinner event in Tokyo, UPS stated.</p>
      <p>The steak reportedly <a href="https://www.aircargoweek.com/ups-and-herdx-serve-beef-with-blockchain/">left</a> Kansas on Nov. 4, after which it arrived at a steakhouse in Tokyo where guests including U.S. Embassy and Japanese officials were able to scan QR codes to access data about the food’s journey.</p>
      <p>UPS’s blockchain initiative is not the first time blockchain has been used to track meat. In November 2018, the South Korean government <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-science-food-ministries-to-use-blockchain-for-tracing-beef-supply-chain">announced</a> it will use blockchain for tracing beef to provide consumers with more data about its supply chain. In March 2018, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-retail-giant-to-use-blockchain-to-track-beef-prove-food-safety">implemented</a> blockchain tech to monitor meat from a farm in Australia.</p>
      <p>In late 2018, UPS chief engineering and information officer Juan Perez <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/too-soon-for-blockchain-benefits-in-2019-says-ups-executive">said</a> that he did not expect any significant benefits from the implementation of blockchain technology.</p>
