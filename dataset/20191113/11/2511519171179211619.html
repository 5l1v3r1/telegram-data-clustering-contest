      <p>The Swede concedes he owes the Portuguese a great deal after being signed by him in a £31m deal in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is still waiting to accept an offer in a coaching capacity and is currently working as a television pundit, with Lindelof yearning for his return to the game.</p>
      <p>“He is, after all, one of the world’s best coaches and he is supposed to have a job at one of the biggest clubs. I miss him in football,” Lindelof told <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/zGzjXr/lindelof-jag-ville-inte-visa-hur-orolig-jag-var">Aftonbladet.</a></p>
      <p>“He’s a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything.</p>
      <p>“I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug.</p>
      <p>“Even if I did not agree, at the time…he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him. He’s won everything. When he says something, you listen.”</p>
