      <h1>Leni meets with US officials on PH drug problem</h1>

      <h3>THE United States has yet to commit to any project with Vice President Leni Robredo who met with US officials yesterday to talk about ongoing and future projects between Washington and Manila on addressing the illegal drug trade in the country.</h3>
      <p>US Embassy press attaché Heather Fabrikant said there had been “no commitments made” when US agencies met with the Vice President in Quezon City.</p>
      <p>This is the first meeting between the US officials and Robredo as the co-chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD).</p>
      <p>“That is what the meeting was about. Stay tuned,” Fabrikant said.</p>
      <p>Fabrikant said the interagency US government working-level delegation was comprised of officers from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of State and US Agency for International Development.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Fabrikant said the two parties discussed the current state of US-Philippines counter-narcotics cooperation as well as “ongoing and potential US government-funded programs to assist the Philippine government efforts in drug demand reduction.”</p>
      <p>Washington and Manila have been coordinating to strengthen drug demand reduction initiatives in the country that have led to interception of illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>Last May, at least 52 officers from the Philippine National Police, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, the Philippine Public Safety College, and Xavier University attended specialized training in substance use disorders, with the goal to provide the criminal justice sector with an evidence-based, public health approach to reducing drug demand.</p>
      <p>The training was a component of the Embassy’s comprehensive program on drug demand reduction covering prevention, treatment, recovery, and policy development.</p>

        <b>Police body cams</b>
      </p>
      <p>Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra yesterday welcomed Vice President Leni Robredo’s proposal to require law enforcement agents to use body cameras in drug operations.</p>
      <p>“I guess that’s a very good idea na merong body cam. Kung wala ka namang tinatago so what’s the problem with having body cams if you are not hiding anything I’m all for it? I just don’t know kung expensive yon pero hindi naman siguro,” Guevarra said.</p>
      <p>Recently Robredo, the newly-appointed drug czar, called for law enforcement agents to use body cameras to ensure the integrity of anti-narcotics operations.</p>
      <p>She stressed that body cameras are a must for the arresting officers as it would ensure the protection of both law enforcement agents and civilians.</p>
      <p>“Indispensable iyong body cams for many reasons,” Robredo said in an interview with the media on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Kasi palitan ng accusations, pero iyong word of honor lang ng nagsasabi iyong pinapanindigan. Pero kung may body cams… ‘yong integrity ng operasyon, mape-preserve,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Philippine National Police and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency have expressed support for the use of body cameras and other gadgets to record anti-illegal drug operations, but the equipment have not been purchased.               </p>
