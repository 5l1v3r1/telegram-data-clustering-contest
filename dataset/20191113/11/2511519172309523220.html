      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a> could exercise a buy-black clause to sign <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Memphis_Depay">Memphis Depay</a> from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Lyon">Lyon</a>, the French club’s chief executive has revealed.</p>
      <p>Depay, 25, joined United from PSV in 2015, but failed to make an impression at the club and was quickly sold to Lyon.</p>
      <p>Since moving to France he has revitalised his career, scoring 50 goals in all competitions in just 130 games.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks Tottenham have reportedly been scouting the Netherlands international – although Lyon chief Juninho has admitted United would be at the front of the queue for his services.</p>
      <p>“It’s true that Manchester United have a priority to buy back Memphis,” the Brazilian told <i>OLTV</i>. </p>
      <p>“These things exist in football. But until now, we’ve not received anything on Memphis.”</p>
      <p>Depay’s current contract runs out in 2021 and Juninho added that it has been difficult for the club to convince him to remain in France.</p>
      <p>“Each time there’s only a year left on a contract, the conversation over a renewal becomes rather difficult,” Juninho said. “But I think that he’s really happy in Lyon at the moment.</p>
      <p>“It’s also the same with Moussa Dembele, but the president and those that know football are conscious that, if you want to start winning titles again, to fight in the Champions League and in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ligue-1">Ligue 1</a>, it’s important to keep players like that in the squad for a long time.</p>
      <p>“For the moment, nothing is being done concerning Memphis. We’ll start discussing a contract extension by the end of the year.”</p>
