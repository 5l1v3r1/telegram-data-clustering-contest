      <p>JAKARTA: A suicide bomber blew himself up at a police station in Indonesia's city of Medan in North Sumatra on Wednesday (Nov 13), killing himself and wounding six others, said authorities who described the 24-year-old attacker as a "lone wolf".</p>
      <p>The motive for the attack was not immediately clear, but Indonesia has suffered <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/suspected-indonesian-militant-wounded-in-failed-suicide-bombing-11594888">a resurgence in homegrown militancy in recent years</a>, with some attacks targeting police.</p>

      <p>The blast happened around 8.45am local time (0145 GMT) at the police compound in Medan during morning roll call.</p>
      <p>"For now, we believe he was a lone wolf," national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>"The initial of the perpetrator is RMM, he is 24 years old, he was born in Medan and he is a student, and more of his identity is still under investigation by Densus 88."</p>

      <p>Six people were injured - four police officers, a part-time worker and a member of the public.</p>
      <p>The victims, who were not seriously injured, were being treated at the North Sumatra police hospital, he added.</p>
      <p>The explosion also damaged three police vehicles and one private vehicle.</p>
      <p>Prasetyo said the bomber managed to enter the police headquarters during a security check, when he "sneaked in" by "making use" of a moment where a large crowd was entering the compound.</p>
      <p>"Then, before he managed to perhaps get to his target, the bomb exploded at the car park."</p>

      <p>Kompas TV reported that many people were applying to get clearance letters from the police - a requirement to join the civil service which is currently open for admission.</p>
      <p>The attacker - whose identification listed him as a student - wore an explosive device on his body, with authorities recovering nails, an on-off switch button, cables and body parts, Prasetyo said.</p>
      <p>A bloody corpse lying in the compound's parking lot appeared to have been blown apart.</p>
      <p>Police said the attacker was active on social media, while CCTV footage showed him entering the compound wearing a uniform worn by drivers of a popular ride-hailing service.</p>

      <p>Prasetyo said police are hoping to establish the bomber's identity by collecting his fingerprints, as well as the type of bomb used through forensic analysis.</p>
      <p>"Once we know the bomber's identity, we will investigate if he was part of the JAD (Jamaah Ansharut Daulah) network or if he was a lone wolf," he said.</p>

      <p>In August, authorities shot and arrested a militant who attacked officers at a station in Indonesia's second-biggest city Surabaya, while in June another was seriously wounded when he tried to blow himself up outside a police building on Java island.</p>
      <p>Last month, the country's leader Joko Widodo ordered beefed-up security measures after two <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-arrests-two-dozen-people-knife-attack-wiranto-12002210">militants from an Islamic State-linked terror group </a>stabbed his chief security minister. He survived the attack.</p>
      <p>The pair were later identified as members of JAD, an extremist network loyal to IS and responsible for several previous attacks - including deadly suicide bombings at churches in Surabaya last year.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Television broadcast images of people rushing out of buildings around the headquarters.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness told Kompas TV: "I was queuing to apply for a clearance letter. Suddenly there was an explosion."</p>
      <p>"It was strong - I felt like I was being lifted from the ground.</p>
      <p>"It sent debris flying. There was white smoke," she said, adding that people were running out in a stampede.</p>
      <p>Another eyewitness told Metro TV: “I heard a loud bang! I was around 20m away. Police immediately secured us and took us to a safe place.”</p>
      <p>In Singapore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) issued a statement early on Thursday (Nov 14) condemning the act of terror at the Police Headquarters in Medan, North Sumatra.</p>
      <p>MFA said there was no report of any Singaporean affected by the incident, and wished those who were injured a speedy and full recovery.</p>
