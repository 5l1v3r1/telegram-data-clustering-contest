      <p>Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd., (The Times of India Group), one of India’s leading multimedia companies, today forayed into beauty services, with the launch of its first Femina FLAUNT Studio Salon in Mumbai. Situated at Khar Linking Road and spread over 3000 sq feet, the studio salon is a ‘statement-making’, contemporary hotspot, serving global beauty services and trends in hair, make-up, nails and skin. The Femina FLAUNT Studio Salon was launched by Mr. Vineet Jain, Managing Director – the Times Group, along with, the gorgeous and 3-time National Award winning actress, Kangana Kanaut.</p>
      <p>Looking at beauty holistically, the company has roped-in renowned experts from the field of fitness and nutrition, Dr. Mickey Mehta and Saanchi S. Nayak, respectively, to serve bespoke as well as holistic beauty solutions, to its customers and well-known celebrity make-up artist Namrata Soni for make-up. Further, Femina FLAUNT has collaborated with some of the best international brands from across the globe – Schwarzkopf, Olaplex, Thalgo, Morrocan Oil, Newsha, Rene Furterer, Bead Head from TiGi, and American Crew, Eminence, Jansen, OPI, Elements, The Nail Lounge, Mint Tree, Footologix, AVL Cosmetics, among others.</p>
      <p>As the melting pot of global influences and Indian sensibilities, Femina FLAUNT Studio Salon has tied up with some of the top beauty bloggers from across the style capitals of the world, from Tokyo to Rio, to bring to Indian consumer a daily canvas of beauty trends - across skin-tones, across nationalities, across sensibilities, and across preferences. Once in the Studio Salon, the consumers not only get to experience the full-fledged services, but also get to see the ‘Top10Looks’ in Make-up and Nails, that Femina FLAUNT has put together, with its experts.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the initiative, Mr. Vineet Jain, Managing Director – the Times Group, said, “We’re excited to extend our legacy brand, Femina in one of the most relevant categories for women – beauty. As Femina enters its 60th year since inception, this is a befitting tribute to a brand that has kept pace with the times, and celebrated women, across generations.” He further added, “Our entry into the beauty segment is in line with the group’s philosophy of continuing to invest in newer and future growth opportunities”</p>
      <p>Commenting on the concept, Kangana Ranaut, said, “The whole concept of beauty has changed considerably over the last few years. Today, women are comfortable in their own skin and are looking at beauty as a way of self-expression. I am really glad that Femina FLAUNT has taken an approach that’s embracing and forward-looking.” She further added, “I am very excited looking at their concept and ideas – the place makes me comfortable and excited at the same time.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on the launch, Sandeep Dahiya, CEO – Times Lifestyle Enterprise, said, “Femina FLAUNT Studio Salon is designed to be a hotspot to ignite ideas for self-expression. It’s a place where beauty meets bravado, glam meets gusto, comfort meets creativity, chic meets street and expertise meets experimentation.” He further added, “As the concept of beauty itself gets redefined, Femina FLAUNT will continue to redefine the ‘experiential’ part in this space.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on the expansion plans, Sandeep elaborated, “The venture will follow a hybrid model of growth in this segment, starting with COCO salons, and simultaneously expanding through a robust franchise program, to create a footprint of over 100 salons in the first 5 years.”</p>
      <p>Celebrated nutrition consultant, Saanchi S. Nayak, feels, “It’s great to see Femina FLAUNT Studio Salon integrate fitness and nutrition with beauty. Our awareness and discipline in our dietary habits and maintaining an active lifestyle directly impacts how we look, and feel. With people getting more aware and conscious about these aspects, initiatives like these are bound to resonate well.”</p>
      <p>According to Miss Diva Universe 2019, Vartika Singh, “I am amazed to see the whole concept of Femina FLAUNT Studio Salon. It’s such a fresh approach in this industry, and I am sure it’ll delight consumers like me, who want to relax and chill, while we’re at the salon.”</p>
      <p>“I loved working with Femina FLAUNT Studio Salon, creating make-up looks for the brand. It’s rare to see a brand give you freedom and let you experiment with your creativity, and I loved that part about their approach.” Said, the well-known celebrity make-up artist Namrata Soni.</p>
      <p>“I have been long associated with the Times Group and I am very excited to collaborate with them on this new venture which is all about beauty, glam and of course fitness! With a 24 hr Beauty Fitness Ritual curated especially for Femina FLAUNT, I am all set to get everyone energized and Mickeymized!!” said, Dr. Mickey Mehta, Global leading holistic health guru / Corporate life coach.</p>
