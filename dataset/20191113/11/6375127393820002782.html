      <h3>JUSTICE Secretary Menardo Guevarra yesterday offered former chief justice Lucas Bersamin protection by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) following disclosure that the retired magistrate has been receiving death threats.</h3>
      <p>“If former CJ Bersamin needs protection from the NBI, or he wants to investigate where the threat is coming from, we will help,” Guevarra vowed.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Supreme Court spokesman Brian Keith Hosaka confirmed that Bersamin has been receiving death threats since his retirement last October 18.</p>
      <p>“Yes. I learned about that yesterday when I briefly talked to him just before the ceremony for his Doctors of Law conferment by the University of the East,” Hosaka said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Hosaka however refused to give more details.</p>
      <p>“Yes, the SC is providing CJ Bersamin security personnel. I cannot divulge anything more for obvious reasons,” Hosaka, the concurrent chief of the SC Public Information Office, said.</p>
      <p>“He was his normal self confident self. I guess coming from a political family, they have encountered this scenario before and they would know how to handle it,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Bersamin retired last October 18. In his farewell speech, he said he wanted to be remembered as a ‘healing chief justice.’</p>
      <p>“I wish to be remembered and known as the healing chief justice who brought stability and normalcy back to the judiciary and particularly to the SC,” Bersamin said.</p>
      <p>“Yes, the judiciary needed healing and it became my response as chief justice to initiate and ensure such healing,” he said.</p>
