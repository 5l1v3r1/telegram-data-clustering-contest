      <p>Eighteen-year-old starlet Rodrygo has been making headlines in recent weeks after breaking into the first team at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>The former Santos prodigy has already scored five goals in six appearances for the LaLiga giants, including a hat-trick in the UEFA Champions League against Galatasaray last week, and earned a call-up to the Brazil national team.</p>
      <p>His form for Real has earned him comparisons to Ronaldo, with some even claiming he is the player to fill the void left behind by the club's all-time record goalscorer.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo has since revealed that he would have loved to have played alongside the Portugal star, who moved to Juventus at the beginning of the 2018/19 campaign, but aaded that it is too soon to see him as the 34-year-old's replacement in Madrid.</p>

      <p>"Being able to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid was a dream of mine and it's a shame that he left because now I think it would be very difficult to play with him," Rodrygo said, as reported by<i> Marca.</i></p>
      <p>"I am still a very young player to talk about filling the place left by someone like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is one of the greatest players in the history of the club – if not the greatest.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to weigh myself down with the pressure of replacing Cristiano Ronaldo."</p>
