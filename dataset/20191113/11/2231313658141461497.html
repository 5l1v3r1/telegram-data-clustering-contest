      <h1>What's Behind Senseonics' Dismal Q3 Results?</h1>
      <h2>The continuous glucose monitoring systems maker's main problem: declining sales.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/2035/" target="_blank">Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz)</a></address>
      <p><b>Senseonics Holdings</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nysemkt/senseonics-holdings-inc/sens/">NYSEMKT:SENS</a>) hasn't given investors a lot to cheer about so far in 2019. The implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems maker's <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/18/why-senseonics-holdings-stock-sank-today.aspx">public stock offering in July</a> raised much-needed cash but also diluted the value of existing shares. Senseonics' second-quarter results, announced in August, weren't very good. Because of the abundance of bad news, shares have fallen more than 60% year to date.</p>
      <p>Don't expect Senseonics' Q3 results to boost investors' enthusiasm. The company reported those results after the market closed on Tuesday. Here are the highlights.</p>

      <h3>By the numbers</h3>
      <p>Senseonics reported revenue in the third quarter of $4.3 million, a 17% year-over-year decline. It was also well below the consensus Wall Street Q3 revenue estimate of $6.07 million.</p>
      <p>Senseonic's net loss in Q3 was $19.5 million, or $0.10 per share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/what-is-gaap.aspx">GAAP</a>). The company's bottom line reflected deterioration from the prior-year period GAAP net loss of $31.9 million, or $0.18 per share. However, Senseonics beat the average analysts' estimate of a Q3 net loss of $0.16 per share.</p>
      <p>The company ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $130.6 million. Senseonics had $136.8 million on hand as of Dec. 31, 2018.</p>
      <h3>Behind the numbers</h3>
      <p>Most of Senseonics' sales of its Eversense implantable CGM system came from outside the United States. International sales in the third quarter totaled $3.8 million. Only around $500,000 in net revenue stemmed from the U.S. market. However, the company reported gross U.S. revenue of $2.1 million. Its net U.S. revenue was significantly lower than this gross amount mainly because of reductions related to the Eversense Bridge Program, Senseonics' patient access program for its CGM system.</p>
      <p>The company's bottom-line performance reflected the revenue drop. Senseonics' operating expenses also increased from the prior-year period. Sales and marketing expenses rose by $3.7 million to $11.6 million as the company expanded its sales team and ramped up commercialization efforts in the United States. Research and development spending increased by $3.7 million to $11.1 million primarily as a result of Senseonics' Promise clinical study costs.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, Senseonics conducted a public stock offering in July. The company also issued convertible debt at the same time. These efforts, combined with debt from a term loan agreement, enabled Senseonics to generate more than $100 million in gross proceeds. Without this added capital, the company's cash position would have looked much worse at the end of the third quarter. </p>
      <h3>Looking ahead</h3>
      <p>Senseonics lowered its full-year 2019 guidance and now anticipates net revenue to come in between $20 million and $22 million. The company previously projected full-year net revenue between $25 million and $30 million. </p>
      <p>CEO Tim Goodnow said that Senseonics has restructured its staff and think it can stretch out its cash. He added that coverage decisions by <b>Humana</b>, Health Care Service Corporation, and Medicare should boost growth next year and beyond. </p>
      <p>But 2020 could be an interesting year for <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest-in-healthcare-stocks.aspx">healthcare stocks</a> with the U.S. presidential election in full swing. Senseonics' fortunes could depend on political winds more than Goodnow might like.</p>
