      <p>A relative has been identified as a person of interest in the murder of Jesse Hess and her grandfather Chris, the student’s family has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Western Cape police on Wednesday would only confirm that a man had been linked by circumstantial evidence to the double murder, which took place in the family’s Parow flat in Cape Town on August 30.</p>
      <p>The suspect has also been linked to a rape and robbery which took place on Monday in Hanover Park, where a 16-year-old girl was raped, police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said.</p>
      <p>The man was wanted for this incident, he said, and was currently on the run.</p>
      <p>Hess and her grandfather were thought to have been murdered during a robbery, where only a TV set, two cellphones and Jesse's backpack were stolen from the house.</p>
      <p>The family moved out of the one-bedroom unit that same day, taking only their clothes.</p>
      <p>Hess, a 18-year-old first-year University of the Western Cape theology student who dreamt of becoming a preacher, was found dead on a bed, while Chris, 85, was discovered tied up in the toilet.</p>
