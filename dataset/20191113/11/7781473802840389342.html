      <h1>Ultraviolette F77 electric motorcycle launched at Rs 3 lakh</h1>

      <p>Ultraviolette, an Indian start-up with investment from names like TVS, has launched their first electric motorcycle in the country - the F77. Starting at Rs 3 lakh on-road, the F77 is available in three variants - Lightning, Shadow and Laser. The deliveries will commence in October 2020 and the first 100 units of the F77 have been sold out already.</p>

      <p>Ultraviolette is touting the F77 as a performance-oriented electric motorcycle, and it has the numbers to back that claim. The motorcycle is powered by a 25kW electric motor that draws juice from three lithium-ion batteries that have a capacity of 4.2kWh. The set-up is good for an output of 33.5PS and 90Nm, which propels this 158kg motorcycle from standstill to 100kmph in 7.5s. For those traffic light drag starts, the F77 goes from 0-60kmph in 2.9s. The top speed for the F77 is claimed at 147kmph and the range with the three batteries onboard is claimed to be between 130-150kmph.</p>

      <p>The motor is mated to the single-reduction helical gearbox and gives you three riding modes to choose from - Eco, Sport and Insane (a la Tesla's Ludicrous mode, scaled-down!), which control the torque output and throttle response. The motor is air-cooled and features Ultraviolette's proprietary thermal management system.</p>

      <p>Ultraviolette says that the fast charger will replenish the juice in 1.5 hours or five hours on the standard charger. The batteries are packaged in a rugged casing to withstand shocks and vibrations and feature a CCS charging port and IP67 battery connectors. The F77 will be available with an optional portable fast charger, alongside a standard charger and a home charging pod.</p>

      <p>The chassis of the F77 is a trellis frame, and a rake angle of 23.5-degree has us believe that it is derived from the chassis of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/ktm/rc-390-m296/">KTM RC 390</a>. But at a seat height of 800mm, you sit even lower than KTM's entry-level supersport. The bike is suspended from inverted forks up front and a gas-charged shock absorber at the rear. The braking kit consists of a 320mm and 230mm drilled rotors at the front and rear respectively, mated to braided metal lines. The tyres are the sticky Metzler M5 in 110/70-17 and 150/60-17 sizes at the front and rear respectively.</p>
      <p>The F77 also features a TFT-LCD instrumentation with an embedded SIM and features like smartphone connectivity, geofencing, vehicle tracking etc.</p>
