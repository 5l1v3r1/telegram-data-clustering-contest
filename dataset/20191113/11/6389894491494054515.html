      </p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p>Statutory profit before tax rose to £25.6m, up from £23.7m for the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Revenue also grew roughly eight per cent, to £594.6m this year from £549.2m in 2018.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share also improved 19 per cent to 11.9p, with an interim divided of 2.47p per share declared.</p>
      <h3>Why it’s interesting</h3>
      <p>At the start of the financial year Biffa simplified its business structure into two divisions, collections, which comprises industrial &amp; commercial, municipal, and hazardous waste, and resources and energy, made up of the former resource recovery and energy divisions.</p>
      <p>The collections division delivered good organic growth, and was boosted by the acquisition of four small businesses, which between them bring in combined revenues of nearly £10m.</p>
      <p>In Resources and Energy, the company reported year on year improvement with revenue up 5.1 per cent due to organic growth.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The recycling portfolio recorded a particularly strong performance due to quick recovery from China’s ban on imports of recycled products, and a boost in polymers from a favourable commercial environment.</p>
      <h3>What Biffa said</h3>
      <p>Chief executive Michael Topham said:</p>
      <p>“Biffa has delivered a strong performance in the first half of the year. Both of our operating divisions achieved their targets, with notable performances in our I&amp;C and Recycling segments.</p>
      <p>“As a result of the sustained progress, and despite the uncertain political and economic environment, our full year expectations remain unchanged.”</p>
      <p>Biffa shares rose 1.8 per cent to 254.5p this morning.</p>
