      <h3>THE RitKen love team of Rita Daniela and Ken Chan are really going places. Now the busiest Kapuso stars seen every single day of the week, they star in the hit romcom “One of the Baes” from Monday to Friday and the journey hosts of the contestants in “The Clash Season 2” on Saturdays and Sundays. Now, both of them are also chosen as endorsers of Beautéderm which has partnered with GMA Artist Center for their newest lineup of brand ambassadors who also include Camille Prats, Sanya Lopez and Pauline Mendoza. It was Ken who first heard about Beautederm from actress Shyr Valdez who’s also a marketing executive of Beautederm.</h3>
      <p>“She gave me some of their products and I tried them,” he says. “Nagustuhan ko talaga kasi big help for us na mga artista in maintaining good skin which we need when we face the camera. Ang buong family ko, gumanda ang skin dahil dito. Then I asked Rita to try it also and nagustuhan din niya. We got surprised when Beautederm president Rhea Tan called us. She watched daw our show, ‘My Special Tatay’, and she liked it so much she offered us to endorse Beautederm.”</p>
      <p>“Na-appreciate ko talaga ang Beautederm products, lalo na their skin care sets, so when their offer came, no second thoughts, yes agad ako,” adds Rita. “What’s nice about their products, they use organic plant-based ingredients kaya very safe and effective.”</p>
      <p>When asked why she got Ken and Rita as endorsers, Ms. Rhea Tan says: “Lukso ng dugo. Nakita ko kasi agad, ang babait nila. And I like it na pareho silang devoted sa families nila. Mababait na mga anak, lalo si Ken who really took good care of his dad nang magkasakit. E, ako, wala na akong dad, e. When I get endorsers, importante sa’kin ang attitude. E, sila, parehong walang arte sa katawan. They join Beautederm’s mall shows, ribbon cuttings ng branches namin, very cooperative lagi.”</p>
      <p>“We really enjoy joining the Beautederm shows even out of town, kasi diyan namin nami-meet ang Kapamilya stars,” says Ken. “Nagiging masaya ang bonding namin with them at diyan ko nga na-meet in person si Arjo Atayde at pinagsama kami dahil we both played autistic characters in our shows. Ang saya ng pakiramdam makatrabaho yung mga taga-kabilang network.”</p>
      <p>Rita and Ken are now so comfortable with each other that their fans expect them to develop real romantic feelings for each other. “When we started working together, we made a pact na, 'o, trabaho lang talaga tayo ha. Walang sinumang mahuhulog sa atin.' Pero naguguluhan na rin ako ngayon, e. Masakit sa akin kapag nakikita kong may kasama siyang ibang aktor.”</p>
      <p>“Maski ako, nagulat sa naging chemistry namin,” says Rita. “Ako mismo, kinikilig kapag pinapanood ko ang mga sarili namin sa ‘One of the Baes’. It’s really rare to find that chemistry with someone. But as of now, masaya na ako na good friends kami at mas maayos ang trabaho namin.”</p>
      <p>Ken and Rita got a big surprise, along with Camille, Sanya and Pauline, when Rhea Tan announced that, as a Christmas gift, she is giving them all a Negosyo Package where they can have their own store to sell Beautederm products. This made them all jubilant. Ms. Tan adds: “My Beautéderm babies are increasing and I am pleased and proud to welcome my GMA Artist Center brand ambassadors to our growing family. They are five of the most amazing artists I have ever met and I am at awe with what they have accomplished in their individual careers.”</p>
