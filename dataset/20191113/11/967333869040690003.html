      <p>To ensure all products on its platform are authentic, Amazon has launched its "Project Zero" in India where there are over 150 million registered users, Indian media reported late Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Amazon became one of the top players in the country's $33 billion e-commerce market.</p>
      <p>With "Project Zero", Amazon plans to identify, block and remove counterfeits from its online shopping platform through – automated protections, self-service counterfeit removal tools and product serialization - that will allow Amazon to individually scan and confirm the authenticity of every single purchase of a brand's enrolled products.</p>
      <blockquote>An unspecified number of local Indian brands participated in the experimental pilot of "Project Zero" to help the company test the experience in India.</blockquote>
      <p>According to media reports, over 7,000 foreign brands from across the US, Europe and Japan enrolled themselves in Amazon's "Project Zero".</p>
      <p>Lately, the e-commerce giant has been focusing on expanding with new features and services on the Indian market.</p>
      <p>Since only 10 per cent of India's over 1.37 billion population speak the English language, earlier in 2018, Amazon added the Hindi language as a step towards making India its next big market.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, while Indian citizens were debating over making Hindi the national language, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201909201076845648-amazons-alexa-now-understands-speaks-fluent-hindi-/">Amazon</a> rolled out Hindi language support for its digital assistant Alexa.</p>
      <p>In October, information from an Indian business insights platform - Paper.v claimed that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910301077178566-amazon-invests-630-million-to-ramp-up-operations-in-india---reports/">Amazon</a> is investing a fresh $630 million (Rs. 4,472 crores) into three of its Indian subsidiaries – Amazon Pay, Amazon Retail, and Amazon Sellers.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the company aims to reach the 500 million mark in the country.</p>
      <blockquote>"With this launch, we're excited to see many more brands in India, from small and emerging entrepreneurs, to large multi-national brands, partner with us to drive counterfeits to zero, and deliver a great shopping experience for our customers," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/%202018/09/04/technology/amazon-%20hindi-india.html">reports</a> quoted Dharmesh M. Mehta, vice president of worldwide customer trust &amp; partner support as saying.</blockquote>
