      <p>Realme is in a roll this month when it comes to providing updates for their smartphones. After releasing a software update for the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/12/realme-2-pro-and-realme-5-updated-with-dark-mode-and-more/">Realme 5 and the Realme 2 Pro yesterday</a>, the company is now <a href="https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1194426315973853184">rolling out</a> another OTA for the Realme 3 and 3i. Just like the previous updates, this update consists in bringing the latest additions to the ColorOS firmware. Therefore, there’s a new System-Wide Dark Mode, Redesigned Notifications Center and Clone App support for more third-party apps.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, the update also bumps the security patch to the latest one available – November 2019. In addition, it includes a new charging animation. Furthermore, users will have a better way to monitor data usage with a customizable data usage reminder and the ability to check how much data connected devices are consuming. Check the full changelog below:</p>

      <p>The usual rules for updates are valid for this one. It’s a gradual OTA release and Realme is rolling it out for a limited number of Realme 3 users. However, a broader rollout will happen if now critical bugs pop-out during the tests. Interestingly enough, these updates are rolling out before the revelation of ColorOS 7.0.</p>
      <p>According to rumors, with ColorOS 7.0, the company will provide a custom branch specific for Realme devices. This custom branch will be close to stock Android.</p>
