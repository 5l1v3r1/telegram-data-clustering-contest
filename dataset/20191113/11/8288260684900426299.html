      <h1>'Bargain of the summer' - Aston Villa players rated for the Premier League season so far</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa player ratings | We take a look at how AVFC's squad have adjusted back to life in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>A dozen games in and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> and their fans can take a breath and reflect on the opening months of the season.</p>
      <p>Since the miraculous winning run started at the back end of last season, it has been a whirlwind for the claret and blues.</p>
      <p>But with just under two weeks until the Premier League kicks back off, it is a time to properly assess how Dean Smith's side have re-adjusted back to the top flight.</p>
      <p>Every week, we rate the Villa players for their showings up and down the country with performances spanning from the superb (Norwich) to the distinctly average (Wolves).</p>
      <p>As Smith and his staff forensically analyse the first three months, we take a look at a number of the key members of Villa's squad. The star of the season so far, the most consistent player, the surprise package and those we expect to see a little more from:</p>

      <h3>Star man</h3>
      <h4>John McGinn</h4>
      <p>Without doubt this is the most difficult award to hand out at this stage.</p>
      <p>The two men that make Aston Villa tick, John McGinn and Jack Grealish ahve both enjoyed seriously impressive starts to the Premier League season.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article16995673.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_McGinn-Grealish.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Both have been nominated for the player of the month, McGinn in Spetember and Grealish more recently for his exploits in October.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international just about pips his his midfield colleague for a slightly stronger start to the season.</p>
      <p>Grealish enjoyed one of the best months in recent memory for a Villa player, but it did, by his very high standards, take him a while to re-adjust to life back in the top flight.</p>
      <p>McGinn meanwhile looked right at home from the first whistle at the Tottenham Stadium. Prior to the season he was linked with a move to the likes of Manchester United, if there were any question marks about his quality at the highest level, they have been well and truly dismissed.</p>
      <p>With three goals he already has half as many goals as he managed in the Championship last term, adding another string to his bow.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Mr Consistent</h3>
      <h4>Bjorn Engels</h4>
      <p>His centre half partne Tyrone Mings, is the man that garners the most recognition from Villa’s defence, but the Belgian has been a welcome addition to the defensive unit.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16813444.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1163412026.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A relative unknown before his move to B6, Engels has slotted into the heart of Dean Smith’s defence with ease. His performances have more than warranted an international call-up, but niggling fitness doubts have curtailed his chances with Roberto Martinez’s men.</p>
      <p>Ezri Konsa played well in his absence at Wolves, but without his right hand man, Mings didn’t look haf as convincing as he usually does.</p>
      <p>For €8m he looks as if he could be the bargain of the summer and has made the right sided centre back a position that requires little thought from fans and manager alike.</p>
      <h3>Surprise package</h3>
      <h4>Frederic Guilbert</h4>
      <p>After finding himself on the bench for the season opener at Spurs, Guilbert has quite rightly earned his place in Smith’s starting XI.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16809612.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS190691009.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>He was somewhat the forgotten man during the summer spending spree, with his deal completed back in January. But he has arguably, been one of Villa’s best performers in the early weeks of the season.</p>
      <p>Elmohamady, for all of his heroics in the Championship season, seems a long way behind the qualities of the former Caen man.</p>
      <p>Against Wolves he was arguably Villa’s most potent attacking outlet, he has the potential to be one of the stars of the season on B6.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Need to see more</h3>
      <h4>The front three – Trezeguet, Wesley &amp; Anwar El Ghazi</h4>
      <p>Many would expect to see Wesley’s name alone in this section, but with four goals and an assist, he has contributed as much as some of the other strikers brought to the league this summer.</p>
      <p>He has to hold the ball up more, but is learning his trade under the glaring spotlight that the Premier League shines on players. For all of his faults, when he is good, he is very good. As Everton and Norwich will attest.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16929024.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1169847710.jpg"/>

      <p>And should he finish with around 12 goals, the £22m will look like money well spent.</p>
      <p>The two men that traditionally start alongside him have both, at times, left a little to be desired.</p>
      <p>Trezeguet’s form has certainly seen an upturn in recent weeks and with two goals in two weeks, he will now hope to fully kick on in English football.</p>
      <p>El Ghazi, as he did for much of last season, has blown hot and cold. He needs to finally step up to be the consistent option Villa fans know he can be.</p>
