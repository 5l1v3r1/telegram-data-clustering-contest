      <p><a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/nafes-monroe-yazeem-jenkins-human-shield-shooting-hunting-park-20191113.html">According to the Philadelphia Inquirer</a> and <a href="https://6abc.com/da-father-used-baby-as-human-shield;-child-shot-4-times-in-philly/5692635/">WPVI-TV</a>, police arrested Nafes Monroe, 25, on Saturday, three weeks after his 11-month-old son, Yazeem Jenkins, was shot multiple times in north Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Monroe was trying to use counterfeit money to purchase drugs Oct. 19 when the suspected gunman, 29-year-old Francisco Ortiz, began shooting, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/nafes-monroe-yazeem-jenkins-human-shield-shooting-hunting-park-20191113.html">the Inquirer reported</a>. Yazeem, who was in a car with Monroe, his girlfriend and a second man, was hit in the chest, head and buttocks, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Afterward, Monroe took Yazeem to a home, then dropped the baby off at a nearby hospital, according to Anthony Voci of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office. The boy's condition is still listed as critical, <a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/11/12/police-father-used-11-month-old-son-as-human-shield-in-north-philadelphia-shooting-that-left-baby-critically-injured/">KYW-TV reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Voci said Monroe had brought Yazeem with him during other drug purchases, as well, "with the idea or belief that if someone saw that he had a child in the car, that they would not fire upon him," <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/nafes-monroe-yazeem-jenkins-human-shield-shooting-hunting-park-20191113.html">the Inquirer reported</a>.</p>
      <p>"A 'human shield' is probably the term that I would use," Voci said, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/nafes-monroe-yazeem-jenkins-human-shield-shooting-hunting-park-20191113.html">according to the newspaper</a>.</p>
      <p>Monroe now faces charges of endangering a child's welfare and reckless endangerment, <a href="https://6abc.com/da-father-used-baby-as-human-shield;-child-shot-4-times-in-philly/5692635/">WPVI reported</a>. Ortiz remains jailed on attempted murder, aggravated assault and other charges, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/francisco-ortiz-bail-revoked-july-gun-possession-october-shooting-yazeem-jenkins-20191101.html">the Inquirer reported</a>.</p>
