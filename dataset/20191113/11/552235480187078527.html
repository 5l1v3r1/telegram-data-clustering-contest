      <p>A woman who sexually abused two young children but screamed ‘I’m not a beast' has been locked up for three years.</p>
      <p>Samantha Smith, 30, repeatedly preyed on a boy aged five and a three-year-old girl at a house in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> and was sentenced today at Hamilton Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>The abuse continued until the boy was eight and the girl five.</p>
      <p>The alarm was first raised in 2012 when the girl revealed Smith had touched her inappropriately and also abused her using a book and a wrapper from a packet of sweets.</p>

      <p>A police investigation was launched but it was decided there was insufficient evidence to pursue a prosecution.</p>
      <p>However, the boy, who suffers from autism, revealed in 2017 that Smith had targeted him.</p>
      <p>He later fled his home in the aftermath of a police interview and sparked a missing person hunt. The terrified youngster was later found cowering in a bush.</p>
      <p>Smith, of Blantyre, Lanarkshire , went on trial at Hamilton Sheriff Court where she denied any wrongdoing between November 2009 and June 2014.</p>
      <p>A jury took an hour to convict her of sexually abusing the youngsters at a house in East Kilbride.</p>
      <p>At her previous hearing Smith wept hysterically in the dock and shouted ‘I’m not a beast’ as the guilty verdicts were returned against her.</p>
