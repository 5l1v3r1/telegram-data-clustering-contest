        <b>Diabetes: The Facts </b>
      </p>
      <p>An estimated 225,000 people in Ireland are currently living with diabetes and another 50% are unaware Ireland is on the verge of a diabetes epidemic, according to a report from The international Diabetes federation Diabetes Atlas 2013. </p>
      <p>Since 1996 the number of people living with the disease has doubled and as a result the cost to the Department of health is 70 million per year, according to an Irish Medical Times article published in 2017. </p>
      <p>Type 1 diabetes develops when the body is unable to produce any insulin, this effects 10-15% of the population and usually starts in childhood and isn’t caused by lifestyle factors. The condition can’t be cured and must be managed by daily injections. </p>
      <p>Type 2 diabetes is often linked with being overweight and obesity and it accounts for 85% of people living with the disease. </p>
      <p>It develops when the body can’t make enough insulin to function effectively or the body cells don’t react to the insulin that’s produced. There are several stages of treatment and the condition can be managed by losing weight and adapting a healthier lifestyle through diet and exercise plus medication. </p>
      <p>In Ireland obese or overweight adults are 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than those adults of a normal weight. </p>
      <p>More than 850,000 adults in Ireland are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to increased obesity rates. The disease usually occurs in middle aged people but more recently it is appearing in much younger people who are overweight. </p>
      <p>Losing just 7% of your body weight can help reduce the risk of developing the disease by 58%. </p>
      <p>When diabetes is not well managed it is associated with serious complications like heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease and amputation which leads to disability and premature mortality. </p>
