      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:22:57+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Former Blackpool boss Ian Holloway has issued a come and get me plea to managerless Hibs and Hearts.</p>
      <p>The Edinburgh sides are both hunting for their next boss after parting ways with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> respectively.</p>
      <p>And Holloway insists he has the inside track on life in the capital due to his Scottish heritage and his meeting with the city's most famous dog.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has been out of work since leaving QPR in 2018 but is keen to make a return to the dugout.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> supremo Ann Budge and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> chief Leeann Dempster are pouring over a list of potential candidates and Holloway admits he would love to talk to both. </p>

      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.thesackrace.com/news/12th-november-2019/id-love-to-work-with-david-beckham-ian-holloway-on-a-move-to-america-the-hibernian-and-hearts-jobs-plus-steven-gerrards-class-touch">Sack Race</a> : "All I'll say is that my wife loves Edinburgh. We’ve been there three or four times as tourists, we absolutely love it. The history, the buildings, the whiskey, all of it!</p>
      <p>“There’s a little statue of a brass dog (Greyfriars Bobby), it brings you good luck apparently so I touched it.</p>
      <p>“I’m also three parts Scottish. Three of my grandparents were Scottish. I’m part of the Malcolm clan. My mum’s dad was one of the Malcolms and it's my mum’s middle name - she used to be called it at school but she hated it. </p>
      <p>“I was eligible to play for Scotland but never got the call up!”</p>

      <p>And the outgoing former Blackpool boss admits he has been interested in previous Scottish football vacancies but his phone didn't ring as he awaited a call.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve never been asked to manage in Scotland but I had a newspaper fella ring me up asking whether I'd consider one of the jobs that came up earlier on this year, and I said ‘yes I would’.</p>
      <p>“He said that he was going to give my number to the Chairman, and I went ‘oh great, I’ll be waiting for a call’. I never got a call.</p>
      <p>“I won't say what job it was but it was one of the ones that came up this season - obviously the Chairman didn’t fancy me did he!”</p>
