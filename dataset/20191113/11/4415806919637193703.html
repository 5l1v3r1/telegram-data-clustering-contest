      <p>Cork-born actor and comedian Niall Tóibín has passed away, his family has confirmed.</p>
      <p>A statement by his daughter, Sighle, said he died in Dublin this morning after a long illness. He was 89.</p>
      <p>He is survived by his children Sean, Muireann, Aisling, Sighle and Fiana and his seven grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Niall's wife, Judy, passed away in 2002.</p>
      <p>President Michael D Higgins, who is visiting Cork today, said he learned of Mr Tóibín's death with great sadness.</p>
      <p>"His contribution to Irish theatre was a unique one, in both Irish and English," he said.</p>
      <p>"The depth of interpretation that he brought to a wide variety of characters showed a very deep intellectual understanding and, above all, sensitivity to the nuance of Irish life.</p>
      <p>"The range of his work was vast and included unforgettable performances in all of the Irish theatres and some of the most important theatres in London and New York.</p>
      <p>"While a huge audience will have adored his comic genius, his work included all the genres – stage, television, film and radio.</p>
      <p>"To the latter he brought a distinctive voice which made him a much-loved interpreter of Irish life and its challenges.</p>
      <p>"Sabina and I send our deepest condolences to his children Sighle, Aisling, Fiana, Sean and Muireann and the other members of his family, and to all those who so loved his work.”</p>
      <p>Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Josepha Madigan TD also paid tribute to the "talented performer".</p>
      <p>"Niall was a uniquely talented performer, light-hearted, funny, sharp-witted and intensely powerful both as an actor and comedian.</p>
      <p>"Niall’s career included work on radio, stage, television and cinema, earning him recognition in Ireland and internationally. He was also hugely loved and respected by all who worked with him."</p>
      <p>He was born in Cork city on November 21, 1929.</p>
