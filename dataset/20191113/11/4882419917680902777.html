      <h1>Real Madrid's Rodrygo: I prefer PSG's Neymar to Barça's Lionel Messi</h1>
      <h2>The young Brazilian spoke from the national team camp pre-Argentina friendly</h2>

      <p>Rodrygo's impressive performances for Real Madrid, including a hat-trick in the Champions League win over Galatasaray, have seen him earn a place in the latest Brazil squad.</p>
      <p>He spoke to the press ahead of Friday's game against Argentina in Saudi Arabia and was asked various questions, including if he prefers Neymar or Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>The former Santos man said that between the Barcelona No.10 and his international teammate, "I say on the side of Brazil, with Neymar."</p>
      <p>Rodrygo's form has earned comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo, who Real Madrid have struggled to replace since he joined Juventus in 2018.</p>
      <p>"I am too young to say that I am filling the space that he left," Rodrygo said. "I am at the beginning of my career at Madrid, I hope to one day be a great player there, but I'm not putting myself under pressure."</p>
