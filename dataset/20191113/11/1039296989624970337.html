      <h1>Royal Enfield Bullet 350 prices hiked</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:58:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Both variants of the newly introduced version of the Bullet 350 prices have gone up by around Rs 3,000.</p>
      <p>Royal Enfield has just increased the prices of its newly introduced and more affordable Bullet 350 models. The single-channel ABS-equipped bikes now cost around Rs 3,000 more than before. Despite the price hike, the Bullet 350 remains to be the most affordable Royal Enfield bike available in India.</p>
      <p>The Bullet models are not only known for being the most affordable Royal Enfield motorcycles in India, but also for being one of the most old-school models. A clear giveaway of this is the retro metal badge the Bullet comes equipped with. However, in August, the company introduced more affordable versions of the original Bullet – and these are the ones that have gone up in price. The price for the older Bullet 350 ABS remains the same at Rs 1.22 lakh.</p>
      <p>Originally launched at Rs 1.12 lakh (kick-start) and Rs 1.27 lakh (electric-start), these bikes now cost around Rs 1.14 lakh and Rs 1.30 lakh. Both motorcycles are powered by the same motor that puts out 20hp at 5,250rpm and 28Nm peak torque at 4,000rpm.</p>
