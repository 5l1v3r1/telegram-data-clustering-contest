      <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) â€” A Florida bill would allow schools to be able to keep and administer naloxone to treat students who overdose on opioids.</p>
      <p>The Senate Education Committee unanimously passed the bill on Tuesday. Naloxone is an opioid-blocking drug used to reverse the effects of an overdose.</p>

      <p>Democratic Sen. Jason Pizzo said he decided to sponsor the bill after receiving an email from a 17-year-old high school student.</p>
      <p>A legislative analysis of the bill says that 25 Florida children died of opioid overdose in 2017.</p>
      <p>Schools that choose to keep naloxone would work with a licensed doctor to develop a protocol for its use.</p>
