      <p>In an <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/19/11/13/145242/apple-unveils-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-with-improved-keyboard-starting-at-2400">interview about the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/13/apple-phil-schiller-chromebooks/">Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller made a direct attack on Chromebooks</a>. When asked about the growth of Chrome OS in the education sector, Schiller attributes the success of Chromebooks to their being "cheap." He said:<i> Kids who are really into learning and want to learn will have better success. It's not hard to understand why kids aren't engaged in a classroom without applying technology in a way that inspires them. You need to have these cutting-edge learning tools to help kids really achieve their best results. Yet Chromebooks don't do that. Chromebooks have gotten to the classroom because, frankly, they're cheap testing tools for required testing. If all you want to do is test kids, well, maybe a cheap notebook will do that. But they're not going to succeed.</i></p>
