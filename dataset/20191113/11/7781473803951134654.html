      <h1>Mercedes-Maybach GLS to be unveiled internationally on November 21</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:22:03+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Mercedes-Benz will reveal the Mercedes-Maybach GLS luxury SUV at the Auto Guangzhou in China. This is the top-of-the-line version of the second-gen <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mercedes-benz/gls-m513/">Mercedes-Benz GLS</a> that debuted earlier in 2019.</p>

      <p>S<a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/2020-mercedes-benz-gls-class-first-drive-review/">py photos have shown that the Mercedes-Maybach GLS will follow the theme set by the S-Class. </a>On the outside, it is expected to sport a new grille with vertical slats and carry slightly restyled bumpers. Wheel sizes are expected to be 20 inches onwards. As for the interiors, we expect the Maybach version to only be offered in the two-row configuration. Alongside this, more options for upholstery and trim, and the option of choosing a rear bench or individual aircraft-style seats are expected. We expected these seats to come with heating, cooling, massaging and reclining functions. A few more passenger-centric luxury features can be expected too, like the rear control unit for the infotainment and blinds, among other things. The MBUX rear entertainment package should be available as well.</p>

      <p>The Maybach GLS should be equipped with the 4.0-litre V8 as seen on the GLS 580 4Matic. This twin-turbo petrol puts out 490PS and 700Nm. It also comes paired with the EQ Boost 48V integrated starter generator which gives it mild-hybrid capabilities, it also supplies an additional 250Nm and 22PS over short periods. A<a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/2020-mercedes-benz-g-350d-exclusive-road-test-review/">nother viable engine option is the 350d diesel</a>. This is a familiar unit to us, available here on the S-Class and G-Class. This 3.0-litre inline-six motor makes 286PS and 600Nm. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic. It is unclear if the 650 grade twin-turbo 6.0-litre V12 engine will also be made available. This unit puts out 621PS and is paired with a 7-speed torque convertor. It is also not known if an extended wheelbase version will be available, as with the S-Class.</p>

      <p>The Mercedes-Maybach GLS is expected to be priced at a roughly Rs 50 lakh premium over the standard SUV. The new SUV is expected to be launched in India by the second quarter of 2020, and the Maybach version should follow soon after that.</p>
