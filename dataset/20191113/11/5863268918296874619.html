      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – The thick blanket of smog once again has engulfed Lahore, forcing citizens to take precautionary measures as the Air Quality Index (AQI) has hit 408 on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>With no sign of its reduction at least in the next few hours, Lahore’s AQI has witnessed a sudden spike of 177 points within 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Weather pundits told the media that the sudden rise in smog stemmed from the smoke and other pollutants from Indian Punjab’s burning crops.</p>
      <p>As per Lahore US consulate Air Quality Monitor feed, the level of smog was hazardous and at 10am, Lahore’s AQI was PM2.5 - 548.</p>

      <p>In Gulberg, the AQI was 556, the Punjab Assembly vicinity observed PM2.5 at 499, Liberty at 400, Upper Mall at 434, Sandar Industrial Estate at 401, Allama Iqbal Town at 384 and Bedian Road at 606.</p>
      <p>The purpose of an AQI is to report air pollution and if it is producing hazardous results. If the rank of air quality index increases to 150, it is unhealthy; if it increases from 200, it becomes a very unhealthy environment.</p>
      <p>Health experts have advised people, especially children and the elderly, to remain indoors and take more liquids.</p>
      <p>For the last four years, smog, rightly being called the fifth season of Lahore, has deprived the people of sunshine and dusk-hour charm as layers of toxic smoke engulf horizon from November to February.</p>
