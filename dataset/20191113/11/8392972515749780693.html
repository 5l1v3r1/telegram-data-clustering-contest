      <h2>They were supporting their charity Shout</h2>

      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge never normally puts a foot wrong, but it seems she tripped at a royal engagement yesterday.</p>
      <p>Kate stumbled as she was getting into her car, according to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7680319/Kate-Middleton-Prince-William-share-smile-tripped-way-car.html">Mail Online</a>.</p>
      <p>She and Prince William were attending a charity event in London for their volunteer text support service Shout.</p>
      <p>As they left the Troubadour White City Theatre, the mum of three seemed to trip.</p>
      <p>William reached out his hand to steady her, but consummate professional Kate had already regained her composure.</p>
      <p>The couple could be seen giving each other a little conspiratorial grin as they got into the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Kate was perfectly turned out for the event in a grey checked Smythe blazer and burgundy Joseph trousers.</p>
      <p>She was also wearing sturdy black block Gianvito Rossi heels.</p>

      <p>Volunteers work from hope at heir computers, enabling a virtual support community.</p>

      <p>It was claimed that she had held private talks with BBC director-general Tony Hall.</p>
      <p>The royal was spotted at the Beeb's Broadcasting House site in London last Thursday.</p>
