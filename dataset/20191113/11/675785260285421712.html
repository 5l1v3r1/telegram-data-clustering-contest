      <h2>Game developer Danny Weinbaum has revealed his predictions for Sony’s 2020 console, and says that he believes the PlayStation 5 ‘will not be revolutionary’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:41:11+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>It’s one of the most highly-anticipated gaming consoles of all time, but new claims suggest that the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> won’t be as exciting as many predict.</p>
      <p>A game developer has revealed his predictions for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sony">Sony</a> ’s 2020 console, and says that he believes the PlayStation 5 ‘will not be revolutionary.’</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/ps5s-ssd-and-zen-2-cpu-will-be-an-evolution-not-a-revolution-eastshade-developer">GamingBolt</a> about the PS5’s Zen 2 CPU, Danny Weinbaum, director of Eastshade, said: “It won’t change much really. It will allow more draw calls I suppose, i.e. more objects on screen.</p>
      <p>“It will be an evolution, not a revolution.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, when quizzed about the PS5’s SSD, Mr Weinbaum said that while he believes the technology will reduce load times, it won’t have much of an impact on performance.</p>

      <p>He added: “Many games have everything they need in memory already, so it wouldn’t affect much there, but it will be helpful for open world titles which require streaming.</p>
      <p>“I’d say it won’t really affect performance much. Mostly it will reduce load times.”</p>
      <p>Mr Weinbaum’s claims come shortly after Jim Ryan, CEO at Sony, finally revealed new details about the PS5.</p>

      <p>He said: “As we move towards the next-generation in 2020, one of our [Sony's] tasks - probably our main task - is to take that community and transition it from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5, and at a scale and pace that we've never delivered on before.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ryan said that Sony is working on several first-party games that could ‘make or break’ the success of the PlayStation.</p>
      <p>However, he added that Sony is already ‘hearing from developers and publishers [about] the ease in which they are able to get code running on PlayStation 5’, which is reportedly ‘way beyond any experience they've had on any other PlayStation platform.’</p>
