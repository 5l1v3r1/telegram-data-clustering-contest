      <p><b>FUKUOKA – </b>Hakuho flexed his yokozuna muscles on Wednesday to stay on the heels of a pair of rank-and-filers in the lead after four days of action at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament.</p>
      <p>The Mongolian-born veteran was made to work overtime by top-ranked maegashira Okinoumi (1-3), who went toe-to-toe with the yokozuna and had Hakuho teetering at the edge, but eventually fell in an otherwise impressive display at Fukuoka Kokusai Center.</p>
      <p>Okinoumi, who went 11-4 and earned a Fighting Spirit Prize at September’s Autumn Basho, was looking to beat the grand champion for just the second time in 22 career matchups.</p>
      <p>Hakuho, chasing a record-extending 43rd top-division title, joins 11 other wrestlers sitting one win behind No. 10 Shodai and top-division rookie No. 16 Wakatakakage.</p>
      <p>Shodai quickly dispatched No. 10 Shimanoumi (2-2) to hold onto his share of the lead, while overnight co-leader No. 9 Yutakayama was steamrolled by No. 8 Sadanoumi (3-1) in his first loss of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Wakatakakage remains perfect in his makuuchi debut after driving out No. 14 Terutsuyoshi (2-2), but appeared to land awkwardly on his right leg as his momentum carried him off the dohyo.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old newcomer had trouble walking on his own power and was eventually carted off in a wheelchair, casting doubt on his fitness for the remainder of the 15-day meet.</p>
      <p>The scene was reminiscent of Day 2, when Tomokaze sustained a serious right knee injury that saw him join the growing list of withdrawals in Fukuoka. Yokozuna Kakuryu and ozeki Goeido also pulled out with earlier injuries.</p>
      <p>In other bouts, komusubi Hokutofuji (3-1) provided the upset of Day 4 by defeating ozeki Takayasu (2-2), who needs at least eight wins to keep his rank.</p>
      <p>Hokutofuji took advantage of a weak initial hit and quickly slipped to the side of Takayasu while turning the ozeki around and driving him out.</p>
      <p>Takakeisho, the other ozeki still competing, got komusubi Endo (1-3) low with a well-timed arm pull and slapped the fan favorite down to the sand to improve to 3-1.</p>
      <p>Among the sekiwake, Tochinoshin (2-2) got his second straight win by expertly employing a last-second throw against No. 3 Takarafuji (1-3).</p>
      <p>Mitakeumi (2-2), meanwhile, allowed No. 1 Daieisho (2-2) to get two hands on his belt and deposit him over the straw.</p>
      <p>New komusubi Asanoyama forced out No. 2 Myogiryu (2-2) to collect his third win, while No. 2 Meisei (3-1) pushed out struggling komusubi Abi (1-3).</p>
      <p>In other rank-and-file bouts, division lightweight No. 6 Enho (3-1) continued to impress, keeping No. 7 Kotoeko (0-4) at bay before bulldozing his opponent off the ring.</p>
      <p>No. 8 Shohozan (3-1) won a hometown battle with fellow Fukuoka native No. 9 Kotoshogiku, executing a powerful overarm throw after a stalemate to keep the former ozeki winless.</p>
