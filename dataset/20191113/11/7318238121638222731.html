      <p>It’s been four years since Paris was hit by a series of coordinated terrorist attacks that killed 131 people and left hundreds wounded.</p>
      <p>On November 13, 2015, France’s national football stadium, cafés, and a concert hall were targeted by a series of coordinated attacks. At the Bataclan concert hall, 90 people were killed.</p>
      <p>The so-called Islamic State terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attacks.</p>
      <h3>What has been the long term impact on survivors of the attacks?</h3>
      <p>Sandrine Martins survived the massacre at the Bataclan theatre and says that beyond the trauma, survivors often feel stigmatised.</p>
      <p>She also said resources and sympathy were dwindling.</p>
      <p>"It’s like you tell a person that is handicapped, we’re taking away your wheelchair, now you’ll have to walk. He won’t be able to do it. That’s how I feel. I have the impression I’m on that wheelchair and that I’m being told go ahead and walk now," Martins told Euronews.</p>
      <p>She explained: "on November 13th we pay homage to the victims, but that’s the only time they think of us. I understand that life must go on but for us, it doesn’t."</p>
      <p>One traumatised survivor, Guillaume Valette, committed suicide in 2017. He was recently recognised by French courts as the 131st victim of the attacks, <i>Le Parisien</i> reported.</p>
      <h3>Commemorations</h3>
      <p>Today, a series of events are scheduled to remember the victims of the deadliest day witnessed in France’s capital since World War II.</p>
      <p>Families of the victims are expected to visit the Bataclan today. There will be speeches by the Justice Minister, the Interior Minister and the Mayor of Paris.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from the Mayor of Paris has said they are deliberately keeping the commemorations low key - at the request of the families.</p>
      <h3>What is happening to the perpetrators?</h3>
      <p>Fourteen people face charges over the attacks and 11 are currently held in custody.</p>
      <p>The process to prosecute those involved has dragged on.</p>
      <p>The investigations only closed in October 2019 and a trial is not expected until at least late 2020.</p>
