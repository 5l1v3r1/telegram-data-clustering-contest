      <h1>Slow down: Dutch cut max speed limit to rein in pollution</h1>

      <p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Dutch government is lowering the top speed limit on highways in a bid to put the brakes on emissions of the pollutant nitrogen oxide.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced Wednesday that the maximum speed limit will be cut from 130 kilometres per hour to 100 km/h (81-62 miles per hour) on many of the country's highways.</p>
      <p>It was a climbdown for Rutte, whose conservative party is known as the "vroom vroom" party because of its support of motorists.</p>
      <p>Rutte says he is "unbelievably unhappy that the 130 is disappearing."</p>
      <p>The measure follows a Dutch Supreme Court decision in May that said the government's rules for granting permits to projects that emit nitrogen oxide breach European Union environmental law.</p>
      <p>That led to a freeze on permits for many construction projects.</p>
