        <i>The Libertines frontman was arrested twice in the past week for attempting to buy drugs and for his involvement in a drunken brawl</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/petedoherty">Pete Doherty</a> has received a three-month suspended sentence for affray and been fined a total of €10,000 (£8,500) after being arrested in Paris twice in one week.</p>
      <p>Doherty was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/08/pete-doherty-arrested-paris">detained on 7 November</a> after buying cocaine in the Pigalle district. He was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/11/pete-doherty-arrested-paris-libertines">arrested again on 10 November</a> after fighting with a teenage boy in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. His lawyer, Arash Derambarsh, said that Doherty was celebrating his release from jail and had consumed alcohol, valium and sleeping pills.</p>
      <p>His suspended sentence relates to the latter offence, for “violence while intoxicated”. <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-doherty/british-rocker-doherty-handed-three-month-suspended-prison-in-paris-idUKKBN1XM16T">Derambarsh told Reuters</a>: “It is a lenient decision. Mr Doherty will be able to keep singing. It is what we had asked.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/libertines">The Libertines</a> are due to commence a European tour in Luxembourg on Sunday. Representatives for Doherty said that his legal situation should not affect the tour schedule.</p>
