      <h1>Scottish Parliament boost for bid to create Galloway National Park</h1>
      <h2>MSPs have backed the creation of new national parks during a debate to mark the Forestry Commission's centenary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:55:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Norris</a></address>
      <p>Hopes that Galloway could host Scotland’s third national park have received a boost from Holyrood.</p>
      <p>MSPs backed creating new national parks during a routine debate to mark the Forestry Commission’s centenary.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government had previously indicated no further national parks were planned for the country at this time.</p>
      <p>The unexpected development came via an amendment to the forestry motion tabled by South of Scotland MSP Colin Smyth.</p>
      <p>It stated: “Parliament ... recognises the contribution that national parks make to protecting forestry and widening the natural environment and therefore believes that new national parks should be designated.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>MSPs unanimously approved the proposition – raising hopes of a full government consultation on the Galloway plan.</p>
      <p>Mr Smyth hoped the decision meant the government’s position was changing.</p>
      <p>He said: “I also hope they are being convinced to come on board with the idea of new national parks in Scotland including here in Galloway.</p>

      <p>“The Government now needs to listen to parliament and the public and work with the community to develop a plan for a Galloway National Park.</p>
      <p>“The momentum behind the campaign for a Galloway national park is growing all the time.”</p>
      <p>News of the move delighted GNPA president Barbara Kelly.</p>
      <p>She said: “The Galloway National Park Association very much welcomes the agreement to Colin Smyth’s amendment.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We recognise the vital role of forestry in the rural economy. But national parks have an equally important role to play.</p>
      <p>“We need a feasibility study which would be a very welcome development.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to discussing this further when we meet Mairi Gougeon later this month.”</p>
      <p>Galloway and West Dumfries MSP Finlay Carson also welcomed the decision.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the debate, he said: “The Scottish Parliament has backed the calls from myself, colleagues and campaigners.</p>
      <p>“I believe the SNP Government now need to seriously look at the what the Galloway National Park campaigners need to do to trigger the consultation and feasibility study process.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">“Today’s vote should reinforce the positive case for ensuring Galloway is the next designated national park.”</a>
