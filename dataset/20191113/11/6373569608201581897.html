      <p>Westcountry comedian Russell Howard has been criticised after mocking a disabled girl’s access ramp.</p>
      <p>Clare Lally, 38, has slammed the Bristol personality after she claims he laughed at her daughter, who had a 60-metre structure installed outside her house to help her get in and out in her wheelchair.</p>
      <p>During an episode of Sky One’s The Russell Howard Hour, the star showed a before and after picture of the house made a series of jokes about the slalom-style ramp.</p>
      <p>Clare expressed her anger at the comedian on Twitter, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/russell-howard-shamed-angry-mum-20867594">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Seeing your home appear on TV and folk laughing is the worst feeling ever.</p>

      <p>“I’m truly upset at your remarks and jokes about our ramp at our home.</p>
      <p>“Firstly, it’s for my disabled daughter, it’s her life and her way of getting in and out her home.</p>
      <p>“If this gives you and your audience a laugh at my daughter’s expense, then shame on you and everyone that laughed.</p>
      <p>“I really thought you were one of the good guys, truly gutted watching you laugh at my disabled child."</p>
      <p>Lally then shared a picture of Katie and her twin sister Holly, adding: "She’s disabled, Russell, she is not the butt of people’s jokes.</p>
      <p>"She is the most strongest, loving person in the world.”</p>
      <p>Katie and Holly were born prematurely in 2006.</p>
      <p>Lally spent two-years battling with officials at West Dunbartonshire Council to get the ramp built so Katie's wheelchair could be used to access the front door.</p>
      <p>She had no say in the design, which was mocked by Howard on his show.</p>

      <p>He called council chiefs "morons" and added: "Can you imagine what that’d be like if you forgot your wallet?...</p>
      <p>"The only good thing about that, you’re not getting bothered by Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</p>
      <p>Doing an impression of Jehovah’s Witnesses approaching the house, he said: “F*** it, they can save themselves.”</p>
      <p>The comic then added: "What I’m trying to say is disability can happen to anyone so let’s make planes, trains, taxis and even comedy clubs accessible so anyone can enjoy them.”</p>
      <p>Viewers flocked to Twitter to call out Howard over the remarks, with one writing: "Disability is not a joke."</p>
      <p>Another added: "A family are extremely upset that their home and their daughter's disability used as a butt for jokes. An apology is immediately required."</p>
      <p>However, there were many fans who backed the comedian, with one tweeting: "Even parents are becoming snowflakes.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://twitter.com/russellhoward">@russellhoward</a> wasn’t mocking the girl with disabilities. He was mocking the fact that council officials didn’t think through the design. Get a grip I’ll always support Russell. He’s funny."</p>
      <p>Another commented: "Leave at <a href="https://twitter.com/russellhoward">@russellhoward</a>  alone he is a good guy and cares about people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>"If you watched the show the other night he was wanting more places to do more ! It was so they have more independence. Keep it up mate your a legend."</p>
      <p>A representative for the Russell Howard Hour told  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10328365/russell-howard-mocked-disabled-home-mum-fury/">The Sun Online</a>: "We have spoken to the family and, at their request, we have no further comment on this matter, but on an important related note we would like to take this opportunity to again highlight the ongoing problems many disabled people have regarding access to buildings and transport in the UK."</p>
