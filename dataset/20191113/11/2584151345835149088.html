      <h1>Von der Leyen to change some Commission titles, social democrats claim win</h1>
      <h2>Move may make confirmation of remaining nominees easier.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:17:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:17</time> by <a rel="author">Maïa de La Baume</a></address>
      <p>European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has agreed to change some job titles in her team, social democrats in the European Parliament said Wednesday, in a move that may ease the confirmation of her remaining nominees.</p>
      <p>The controversial vice presidency for "protecting our European Way of Life," to be held by Margaritis Schinas of Greece, will be renamed to become "promoting our European way of life," the Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D) group said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The future commissioner for jobs, Nicolas Schmit of Luxembourg, will have "social rights" added to his title while "fisheries" will be added to the title of Virginijus Sinkeviçius, the commissioner-designate for Environment and Oceans.</p>
      <p>Paolo Gentiloni, the Italian center-left commissioner-designate, will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of U.N. sustainable development goals.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;D group hailed the moves as significant concessions by von der Leyen.</p>
      <p>"Following several days of negotiation with the president-elect of the European Commission, this morning S&amp;D President Iratxe García received confirmation from Ursula von der Leyen that she agrees to a series of important demands made by the Socialists and Democrats," the group said.</p>
      <p>Von der Leyen's moves are likely to increase the chances of her three remaining nominees receiving support from center-left MEPs in the confirmation process this week — particularly Thierry Breton, the French nominee for the single market portfolio who initially got a critical reception from S&amp;D members of the Parliament.</p>
      <p>An S&amp;D official said "von der Leyen's commitments are very well-received in the group, and Breton's hearing is likely to go smoothly."</p>
