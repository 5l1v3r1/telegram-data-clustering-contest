      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has issued an ice warning before temperatures plunge on one of the coldest nights of autumn.</p>
      <p>It said: "Scattered showers will affect much of the east coast of Scotland this evening and overnight, falling onto freezing surfaces.</p>
      <p>"These will be heavy at times and will lead to a risk of icy surfaces where any treatment is washed off.</p>
      <p>"Showers will be wintry above 200m away from the coast across Aberdeenshire and Moray, with 1-2cm of snow possible."</p>
