      <p>Sega's next entry in the face-mashing <i>Yakuza</i> franchise, <i>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</i>, has received a new trailer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../yakuza-like-a-dragon-will-be-getting-a-demo-at-some-point-571391.phtml">to celebrate the launch of its first demo</a>, now available on the Japanese PlayStation Store. The new video, featuring a whopping ten minutes of cinematics, is a little heavy on the spoilers, so fans who wish to stay in the dark might want to skip it (along with the rest of this article) entirely.<br/><br/>Alongside the usual high drama and tense confrontation one expects from the<i> Yakuza</i> series - as new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga fights his way through another slew of gangster-related worries - the video ends with the reveal that longtime <i>Yakuza</i> hero Kazuma Kiryu will make an appearance in the new game, and is depicted doing what he does best: looking stoic while smoothly ripping off his upper clothing.<br/><br/>Personally, I was hoping the franchise would make a completely fresh break from even remotely featuring Kazuma himself, even if we would see the return of other characters from the huge <i>Yakuza</i> universe. I guess the producers couldn't help themselves, after all, you can never keep a good man down.<br/><br/><i>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</i> launches on PS4 in Japan January 16, and will head west later in 2020.</p>
