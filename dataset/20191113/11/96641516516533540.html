      <p>Nickelodeon and Netflix just <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-and-nickelodeon-form-multi-year-output-deal-to-produce-original-animated-films-and-series-for-kids-families-around-the-world">announced</a> a multi-year deal to produce original animated content based on the Nickelodeon library and new characters. The details are still vague, but the companies have previously worked together to bring us <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/14/netflix-invader-zim-rockos-modern-life-movies-release-date/"><i>Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus</i> and <i>Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling</i></a> and promised a "reimagined," live-action <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/18/avatar-the-last-airbender-netflix-series/"><i>Avatar </i>series</a>.</p>
      <p>The deal might make you wonder why Viacom-owned Nickelodeon is partnering with Netflix when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/09/viacom-streaming-service-launch-this-year/">Viacom</a> has its own streaming service and is in the process of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-merger-deal-30-billion/">merging with CBS</a>, which also has its own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/05/cbs-all-access-is-now-available-on-amazon-video/">streaming service</a>. Chances are, Netflix is funding a good portion of the production costs, and it's undoubtedly a move to challenge Disney+, which just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-launch/">launched yesterday</a>.</p>
      <p>We do know that Nickelodeon has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/07/nickelodeon-will-use-vr-and-ar-to-keep-kids-off-netflix-and-yout/">working on new content</a>, like a <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> reboot and <i>Blue's Clues</i> remake. While we wait for more details, we can hope for a <i>Rugrats</i> (even-more) <i>All Grown Up!</i> series. And if you want to catch up on the classics, you can always stream them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/28/stream-nickelodeon-classics-vrv/">on VRV</a>.</p>
