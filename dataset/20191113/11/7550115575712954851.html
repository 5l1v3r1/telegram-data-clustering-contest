      <p>Alexander-Arnold continues to astound with his ability, with the general consensus that he is the world’s best attacking full-back currently.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has redefined the position at Liverpool in many ways, acting as a playmaker from deep and producing devastating end product.</p>
      <p>That was on show in the 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> on Sunday, when his wonderful cross-field pass to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> eventually led to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> heading home.</p>
      <p>One of the many admirers of Alexander-Arnold is Carragher – someone who played at right-back for the Reds, but was far more limited as a player.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnfieldWrap/status/1194321460933910536?s=20">The Anfield Wrap</a>, the former defender lauded Liverpool’s newest Scouse hero, comparing him to Gerrard in terms of influence:</p>

      <blockquote>“I don’t think I’ve seen a full-back like Trent [Alexander-Arnold] before in the game. <br/><br/>“You’ve got great full-backs like Cafu and Roberto Carlos, overlapping and putting a great cross in, but he’s Liverpool’s playmaker.<br/><br/>“Liverpool’s setup isn’t that conventional, with midfielders hard-working, running and covering people – Trent is like a midfield player.<br/><br/>“It’s like putting Steven Gerrard there. That’s how I imagine he’d have played at full-back.<br/><br/>“When Stevie played with us, every time you got the ball you wanted to give him the ball, because you knew there wouldn’t be a simple pass next. It’s like that with Trent. <br/><br/>“Sometimes they (players like Alexander-Arnold) just take that extra half a second on the ball, because they’re looking for something to happen.<br/><br/>“I was watching him on Sunday and he could have given it to (Dejan) Lovren, but he’s looking for the left-footed pass (to Robertson).<br/><br/>“Liverpool are the best team in Europe and the playmaker is a right-back. I’ve never seen someone have that much influence on the ball in a team from that position.”</blockquote>

      <p>What Alexander-Arnold is achieving for Liverpool is remarkable, considering he has only recently turned 21 years of age.</p>
      <p>He is more creative than the vast majority of midfielders in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a>, with arguably only Kevin De Bruyne possessing a more consistent final ball.</p>
      <p>Carragher once joked that “nobody wants to grow up and be a Gary Neville”, because right-back has often been considered an unfashionable position.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold is completely changing that, however, making it one of the most exciting roles in this fantastic Liverpool team.</p>
