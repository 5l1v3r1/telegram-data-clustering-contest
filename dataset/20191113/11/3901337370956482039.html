      <p>Teboho Mokoena was the hero for South Africa's U23s on Tuesday night, thumping home a stunner of a free-kick to give them their first three points of the U23 Africa Cup of Nations tournament.</p>

      <p>David Notoane's side won 1-0 against the Ivory Coast in Cairo and climbed to the top of their group going into their third game, and it's all thanks to the SuperSport United midfielder that only arrived in camp a couple of days ago.</p>
      <p>The Matsatsantsa star was straight into the starting line-up alongside his teammate, Sipho Mbule, after the duo were just two of the key players that missed the opening U23 AFCON game against Zambia, but he made sure to make up for his absence when he rifled home a superb freekick from range to give them the win.</p>
      <p>Other results last night mean that Notoane's side are the only team in Group B left without defeat after two games played each, and they know that a draw in their final game against Nigeria on Friday will be enough to see them progress to the semifinals.</p>

      <p>The top three teams at the tournament will book their place at the 2020 Olympics in Japan, and South Africa will be eager to do even better than their last outing at the competition in 2015 when they finished third.</p>
