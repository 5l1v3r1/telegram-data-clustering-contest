      <h1>Election 2019: Labour tops Tory pledge on NHS spending</h1>
      <h2>Pledge comes as campaigning for upcoming election gathers steam</h2>

        <b>Labour has said it will raise the funding it will commit to NHS England in 2023-24 to £155bn – £5.5bn more per year than has been promised by the government.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pledge comes as campaigning for the 12 December election gathers steam, and once again the NHS has emerged as a key <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/nhs_leader_warns_politicians_not_to_weaponise_the_health_service_1315325">battleground</a></u> for the major parties, second only to Brexit.</p>
      <p>According to the Labour front bench, this will be the biggest boost to health spending since Labour was last in power from 1997 to 2010.</p>
      <p>The overall package amounts to a £26bn ‘rescue plan’ for the NHS between 2018-19 and 2023-24 that will be used to recruit thousands of staff, rebuild facilities and invest in modern equipment.</p>
      <p>It would be paid for by higher taxes on companies and high income earners, says Labour, and result in reduced waiting times, improving cancer survival rates, skills training and £1.6bn to expand mental health counselling services.</p>
      <p>Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth – who will present the plans at the Royal Society of Medicine in London today – is expected to say: “A decade of Tory underfunding and cuts has driven our NHS into year-round crisis. Over 15,000 beds have been cut, hospitals are crumbling and our NHS is chronically short of nurses and family doctors.”</p>
      <p>He will continue: “This general election is about millions on waiting lists and hundreds of thousands who’ve waited on trolleys under the Tories – only Labour has a plan to rescue our NHS.”</p>
      <p>The government has retorted that Labour policies such as the move to a four-day working week will actually reduce the amount of money available to the NHS if a Labour government is elected.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Jeremy Corbyn's plans for a four-day working week will cripple our economy and cost the NHS billions every year. That leaves a huge funding shortfall in Labour's plans and it is patients who will pay the price for Corbyn's incompetence.”</p>
      <p>Labour insists however that the shorter working week would be phased in over 10 years and would be offset by productivity gains.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/boris_pledges_a_1.8bn_cash_injection_for_the_nhs_1296269">promised</a></u> to increase the health budget by £33.9bn by 2023-24, including a £1.8bn pot for capital investments.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats’ health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said the Labour proposal “misses the point” as “they are ignoring the fact that Brexit is the biggest threat to the NHS – if Labour allow Brexit to happen, they cannot rescue our NHS”.</p>
      <p>Party politicking aside, the NHS Confederation welcomed the pledge of additional cash. Chief executive Niall Dickson said: “Labour’s pledge to spend more on the NHS would represent a significant extra investment on top of that already pledged by the Conservatives which, if used wisely, would help to transform services and retain frontline staff.”</p>
