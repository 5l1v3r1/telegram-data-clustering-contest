      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday that there had been no discussion yet of German government subsidies for U.S. electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>), which has said it will build its first European factory near Berlin.</p>
      <p>“Subsidies have not yet been discussed. It’s clear that Tesla - if it invests in Germany and creates jobs here, will be treated like all other companies in the automobile and automotive industry,” Altmaier told reporters.</p>
      <p>“That means we will treat all players who invest in Germany equally and without discrimination,” he said.</p>
