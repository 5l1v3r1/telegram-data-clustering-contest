      <h1>Oil falls as US-China trade deal prospects dim</h1>

      <p>SINGAPORE/LONDON (Nov 13): Oil prices fell on Wednesday as prospects for a trade deal between the United States and China faded, weighing on the outlook for the global economy and energy demand.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the two countries were close to finalising a trade deal, but he fell short of providing a date or venue for the signing ceremony, disappointing investors.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures fell 75 cents, or 1.25%, to US$61.31 a barrel by 1030 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was at US$56.30, down 50 cents or 0.9%.</p>
      <p>"The expectations of an inventory build in the US and uncertainty over the OPEC+ strategy on output cuts and US/China trade deal are weighing on oil prices," said analysts at ING including the head of commodity strategy Warren Patterson.</p>
      <p>The Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Mohammad Barkindo, said he was still confident the United States and China would reach a trade deal.</p>
      <p>"It will almost remove that dark cloud that had engulfed the global economy," he said adding that it was too early to discuss output policy of OPEC's December meeting.</p>
      <p>In the United States, crude oil inventories were forecast to have risen for a third straight week last week, while refined products inventories likely declined, a preliminary <i>Reuters </i>poll showed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>ANZ analysts said the prospects for US crude exports had turned bleak after shipping rates jumped last month.</p>
      <p>The American Petroleum Institute (API) is scheduled to release its data for the latest week at 4:30pm EST (2130 GMT) on Wednesday, while the weekly report from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due at 11:00am EST on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Separately, the Keystone oil pipeline that transports Canadian heavy crude to the United States has restarted operations following an oil spill two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>A forecast by the International Energy Agency for slower global oil demand growth post-2025 also weighed on the market.</p>
      <p>Global oil demand is expected to grow by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) on average to 2025, but is forecast to slow to 100,000 bpd a year from then on as fuel efficiency improves, the IEA said in its annual outlook to 2040.</p>
