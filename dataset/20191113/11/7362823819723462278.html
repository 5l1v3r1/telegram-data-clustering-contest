      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis">Tennis</a> great Rafael Nadal got testy with a reporter Monday over a question about his play on the court and his recent marriage.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who married Xisca Perello in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/spain">Spain</a> last month, lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev at the ATP World Finals. It was Nadal’s first major competition since tying the knot. A reporter asked him whether his new marriage had something to do with his loss and Nadal did not like that question at all.</p>

      <p>“Honestly, are you asking me this?” Nadal said. “Is [this] a serious question or it's a joke? Is it serious?”</p>
      <p>After the reporter kept pushing the question onto Nadal, the 19-time Grand Slam winner fired back saying: “I'm surprised. It's a big surprise for me you ask me this after I have been with the same girl for 15 years and having a very stable and normal life."</p>

      <p>“It doesn't matter if you put a ring on your finger or not. In my personal way, I am a very normal guy.”</p>
      <p>Nadal then ended the line of questioning with the reporter: “OK. We move to Spanish because that's bulls—t. Thank you very much.”</p>

      <p>Nadal and Perello have been together since 2005 – the same year he won his first French Open championship. The two reportedly got engaged in January and wed in October.</p>
