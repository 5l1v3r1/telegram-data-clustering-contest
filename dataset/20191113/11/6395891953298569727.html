      <h1>Chinese buyer of British Steel looks to grow abroad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:02:57+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:02</time> by <a rel="author">JOE McDONALD, AP Business Writer</a></address>
      <p><b>BEIJINGÂ (AP)</b> - Jingye Group's purchase of British Steel Ltd. gives the privately owned Chinese steelmaker a chance to grow outside a home market dominated by giant state-owned mills.</p>
      <p>The deal adds to a string of global acquisitions by Chinese companies that want to speed their growth in industries from computers to cars to chemicals by obtaining technology, brands and sales networks.</p>
      <p>Jingye is part of a sprawling Chinese industry that produces half the world's steel. It's regarded as technologically advanced but ranks 17th among China's producers with 2018 output of 11 million tons - less than one-sixth that of the biggest state-owned mill.</p>
      <p>State-owned steel mills receive subsidies, low-cost loans, government contracts and other support.</p>
      <p>"As a private steel company, it doesn't have a strong competitive advantage in China, so it wants to expand its competitiveness by going international," said Wang Guoqing, director of the Lange Steel Information Research Center in Beijing.</p>
      <p>Jingye, headquartered in the central city of Shijiazhuang, was founded in 1988 by Li Ganpo as a chemicals producer and expanded into steel in 2002. Like many Chinese companies, it has interests in unrelated fields including tourism, hotels and real estate.</p>
      <p>The company says it has 23,500 employees and 2018 sales of 90.1 billion yuan ($12.9 billion) but doesn't report profits or other financial details.</p>
      <p>The British deal could allow Jingye to sell to European markets without adding to trade strains by increasing imports from China.</p>
      <p>The price, reported to be up to 70 million pounds ($90 million), is modest compared with China's most ambitious acquisitions.</p>
      <p>In 2017, state-owned chemical producer ChemChina paid $44 billion for Swiss seeds and pesticides company Syngenta in the biggest Chinese corporate acquisition to date.</p>
      <p>Chinese companies also have acquired German robot maker Kuka, Sweden's Volvo Cars, the Motorola mobile phone business and IBM's PC and low-end server units.</p>
      <p>Some purchases prompt unease about security or the loss of a national asset, but most Chinese buyers are welcomed because they preserve jobs and invest to expand businesses.</p>
      <p>The ruling Communist Party is encouraging such acquisitions to support technology development plans. Buyers often receive financing from state banks or investment funds.</p>
      <p>The British acquisition comes amid a marathon campaign by Beijing to make its steel industry more efficient and profitable.</p>
      <p>Regulators are pressing steelmakers to merge and to close small and older mills while improving technology. That has wiped out more than 1 million jobs but more efficient mills are increasing output.</p>
      <p>Last year, Chinese steel production rose 6.5% to 928.3 million tons, or 51% of the global total, according to World Steel, an industry group.</p>
      <p>China's biggest steel producer is China Baowu Group, a government-owned behemoth with 2018 output of 67.5 million tons. Hebei Iron &amp; Steel Group was second with 46.8 million tons.</p>
      <p>Hebei Steel gained its own European foothold in 2016 by acquiring a mill in the Serbian city of Smederevo for 46 million euros ($52 million). The Chinese buyer said it would keep the workforce of 5,000 and invest 300 million euros ($340 million).</p>
      <p>"As competition in the steel industry gets stronger, we will see more internationalization and consolidation," said Wang.</p>
      <p>Jingye's rescue deal could help save 4,000 jobs and safeguard a strategic asset as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>It includes steelworks at Scunthorpe, U.K. mills and shares of FN Steel BV, British Steel France Rail SAS and TSP Engineering. The sale also includes British Steel's Redcar Bulk Terminal Limited.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the British government said it had done all it could for the company, including providing a 120 million-pound ($152 million) bridging facility to help meet emission trading compliance costs. Going further was considered potentially unlawful as it could be considered illegal state aid.</p>
