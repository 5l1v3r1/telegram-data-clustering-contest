        <b>The company's decision to go digital was against Todd Phillips' wishes</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> cinematographer Lawrence Sher has revealed that the film was originally set to be shot on 70mm celluloid film, like so many of its influences.</p>
      <p>The film ended up being shot digitally, and it was on the insistence of studio Warner Bros, Sher says.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Sher was speaking at Poland’s Camerimage Film Festival when he revealed that shooting on film was the original plan for <i>Joker</i> director Todd Phillips, as <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/festivals/lawrence-sher-joker-joaquin-phoenix-camerimage-1203402136/">Variety</a></i> report.</p>
      <p>The report states that Joker was initially meant to be a 70mm film shoot, but the plans were “quashed” by Warner Bros.</p>

      <p>“Todd was really adamant about shooting film, convinced we’d just shoot 35mm like we did on his previous films,” Sher previously told <i><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/feature/large-format-cameras-arri-alexa-65-film-language-joker-roma-midsommar-1202179944/">IndieWire</a></i> of the plans for the film.</p>
      <p>“We drove around to three or four different places around [New York] and captured imagery with no lighting in both [35mm and 65mm film]. And when we looked at them side by side, we really loved the large-format aspect of the 65.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “We were often going to be quite close to Joaquin physically, in proximity, in his apartment in some of those scenes.</p>
      <p>“A camera three feet away from him, which also has a real psychological effect of connecting you to a character and feeling that sense of intimacy, but now we didn’t need to shoot it on a 21mm or a 24mm.”</p>
      <p>It was revealed this week that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joker-bathroom-scene-cut-for-being-too-insane-for-r-rating-2567243">one scene was cut from Joker for being too “insane” even for an R-rated movie</a>.</p>
      <p>It comes after star Joaquin Phoenix stated that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joker-one-best-scenes-cut-says-joaquin-phoenix-2561183">“one of the best” scenes from the film ended up being cut</a>.</p>
