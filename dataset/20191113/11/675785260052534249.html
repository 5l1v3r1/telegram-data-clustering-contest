      <p>If you're a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vegan">vegan</a> and love <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chocolate">chocolate</a> , getting your fix is about to become a whole lot easier.</p>
      <p>Mars is set to launch a range of vegan Galaxy chocolate bars for the first time in the UK - and they sound delicious.</p>
      <p>The new plant-based versions of Galaxy's best-selling chocolate bars will be available in three flavours: Smooth Orange, Caramel &amp; Sea Salt, and Caramelized Hazelnut.</p>
      <p>They are going on sale at <a href="https://fave.co/32HAxzP">Tesco</a> supermarkets nationwide from Monday, November 18 and then online at <a href="https://fave.co/33J1Xqp">Ocado</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/34PErIm">Amazon</a> .</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Shoppers can pick up the 100g vegan chocolate bars for £3 each - which is double the price of the original Galaxy (£1, <a href="https://fave.co/33VEcew">Tesco</a> ).</p>
      <p>Mars, which is Britain's second-largest confectionery brand, claims it has spent over six months reformulating its cult chocolate bar.</p>

      <p>The new plant-based recipe replaces dairy with hazelnut paste and rice syrup.</p>
      <p>Not only are these tempting bars vegan-friendly, but also come in eco-friendly packaging made of card and compostable film.</p>
      <p>Kerry Cavanaugh, marketing director at Galaxy manufacturer Mars Wrigley UK, said: “Wherever you look you can’t avoid the vegan buzz in the UK and with the launch of Galaxy Vegan we’re thrilled to be offering vegans, flexitarians and lovers of sweet treats even more ways to choose pleasure with a brand they love.”</p>
