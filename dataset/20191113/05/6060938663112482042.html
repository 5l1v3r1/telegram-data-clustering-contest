      <p>MELBOURNE: Former <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/india-vs-australia">Australia</a> wicketkeeper-batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Adam-Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> has said that India's off-spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harbhajan-Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> was one of the toughest bowlers he faced in his career and even labelled him his 'nemesis'.</p>
      <p>Gilchrist also remembered the iconic 2001 Test series against India. It was won by India, but till date it is remembered for the match that was played at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>.</p>
      <p>Gilchrist scored a century in the first Test of the series in Mumbai, but during the next two matches, he failed to leave a mark as Harbhajan kept sending him back to the pavilion .</p>
      <p>"We were five for 99. I went in there, got a hundred off 80 balls, we won in three days and I just thought, 'What have these blokes been doing for 30 years. How easy is this? And how wrong I was. We've only got to fast-forward to the next Test match and I came back to reality," <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a>.com.au quoted Gilchrist as saying.</p>
      <p>"As it would turn out, by the end of that series, we probably needed to learn how to put a handbrake on just to get a holding pattern, rather than 'attack, attack, attack' because it doesn't always work. Harbhajan bamboozled us. He was a bit of a nemesis for me right throughout my career. I found him and Murali (Muttiah Muralitharan) probably the two hardest bowlers to face," he added.</p>
      <p>During the 2001 series, Gilchrist became the first Australian to record a king pair in Test cricket. Harbhajan took 32 wickets in three matches, including the first-ever Test hat-trick for India.</p>
      <p>During the Eden Garden Test, Australia were in a dominant position for the majority of the match and the game was a must-win for India after losing the first Test. Australians were in total control at the Eden Gardens as they enforced the follow-on.</p>
      <p>In the first innings, the Sourav Ganguly-led side was bundled out for 171 in reply to Australia's 445.</p>
      <p>In the second innings, Indian openers were dismissed and VVS Laxman came out to bat next. Nobody would have anticipated that the batsman would go on to produce a 'miracle' for the side.</p>
      <p>He found support in Rahul Dravid and the duo went on to stitch a partnership of 376 runs. Laxman and Dravid thwarted the Australian bowling attack, which comprised of Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, to keep the visitors wicket-less for an entire day.</p>
      <p>Laxman went on to score 281, while Dravid made 180. It helped India produce one of the greatest comeback victories. The knock by Laxman remained the highest individual Test knock by an Indian batsman till 2004, when it was surpassed by Virender Sehwag.</p>
