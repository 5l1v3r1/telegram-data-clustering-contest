      <p>A 37-year-old man who handed himself over to the police after he allegedly shot and killed a man at Speedy Car Sales in Klerksdorp will be appearing in the town's magistrate's court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The man allegedly gunned down the owner of the luxury car dealership, Mohammed Dangor, and injured two other people, according to Captain Aafje Botma.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-hands-himself-over-after-allegedly-shooting-klerksdorp-car-dealership-owner-20191111">News24</a> previously reported the police were investigating a murder and two attempted murder cases.</p>
      <p>Botma told News24 the shooting happened after an argument broke out between the suspect and victim.</p>
      <p>"The suspect allegedly entered Speedy Car Sales and [an] argument broke out between him and one of the salesmen or the manager. I can't say what his [the deceased's] position is."</p>
      <p>Botma said the argument allegedly regarded a business transaction.</p>
      <p>Speedy Car Sales could not be reached by News24 for comment. </p>
