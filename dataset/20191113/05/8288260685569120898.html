      <p>Villa went into the last international break on a high, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-five-wesley-live-17032344">beating Norwich City 5-1 to record their first win</a> of the season away from home.</p>
      <p>They returned from the two-week break and beat Brighton and Hove Albion at Villa Park to lift themselves to mid-table - but that was their last win.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Smith</a>'s side host Newcastle United before a trip to Manchester United when the season resumes two week's yesterday.</p>
      <p>And the Villa boss has vowed he won't let his side rest this weekend as he searches for that winning formula once again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I think a look at the squad to see how many are called-up internationally is probably a good marker to see how we are doing," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no2dJpr2VSk&amp;t=92s">he told the club's YouTube channel</a> .</p>
      <p>"Tyrone got his first start for England, John scores a hat-trick, Trezeguet goes away and Douglas has been called up to the senior squad for Brazil.</p>
      <p>"We've got an awful lot of players who are away and it's really important that the players who are here keep improving and we keep making sure they get their little breaks they require to, physically and mentally, have a little bit of a relaxation.</p>
      <p>"We won't rest on our laurels and we will keep working hard here to make sure that when we come back for Newcastle United we are in tip-top shape."</p>

      <p>Smith will be hoping to get some of his injured players back to full fitness ahead of the visit of Newcastle.</p>
      <p>And while he will bid plenty of Villans farewell for two weeks, there will be hard work for the rest of them left behind.</p>
      <p>"We could have 12, 13 or 14 players away and they work hard when they are away because they are playing for their countries ans we wish them all well," he added.</p>
      <p>"So it's important that the players who are with us don't just see that as a break.</p>
      <p>"I think it's called an international break but for us it's an international period."</p>
