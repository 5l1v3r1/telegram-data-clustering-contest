      <h1>Bukit Aman: Ex-rock band drummer among two Malaysian IS fighters killed in Syria this year</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — Two Malaysians with the Islamic State (IS) world terror network were killed in a Russian air strike in Syria this year, according to police intelligence reports.</p>
      <p>Counter-terrorism chief Datuk Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said intelligence reports received by Bukit Aman from its foreign counterparts indicated that Akel Zainal — a former drummer of defunct 1990s rock band The Ukays — his wife and two children died in their Syrian home during the March air strike.</p>
      <p>“Based on the information we gathered, Akel along with his wife, his three-year-old son and two-year-old daughter were reportedly killed in the airstrikes.</p>
      <p>“One of the airstrikes hit his home. At that time, a Belgium militant with him was also killed,” the principal assistant director of Bukit Aman’s Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Division told <i>Malay Mail</i> when contacted today.</p>
      <p>Akel has been under Malaysian police watch since 2014 when he was first said to have been part of the Syrian militant movement.</p>
      <p>He was reported to have taken on a leadership role and actively recruited other Malaysians to fight for the IS in Syria following the death of another Malaysian militant, Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi in April 2017.</p>
      <p>The other Malaysian killed in a Russian air strike on Syria last January was Mohd Rafi Udin, 53, He was also known as Abu Ain and Abu Awn al-Malisi.</p>
      <p>Malaysian authorities previously swore to crack down on Akel and other Malaysian IS fighters abroad if they ever returned home.</p>

      <p>Ayob said both air strikes took place near Baghouz, a town on the Iraqi border and the last IS bastion in Syria. </p>
      <p>The senior Malaysian policeman said Mohd Rafi was featured in an IS propaganda video in 2016 alongside an Indonesian and a Filipino participated in decapitations.</p>
      <p>They each beheaded a Middle Eastern-looking prisoner. It was the first time Southeast Asian IS fighters have been filmed carrying out beheadings.</p>
      <p>Akel travelled to Syria after being influenced by another Malaysian identified as Ustaz Lofti Ariffin. </p>
      <p>Ustaz Lotfi, formerly an Internal Security Act detainee, was the third Malaysian to die in the war in 2014.</p>
