      <p>When Chile’s unrest forced the U.N. climate venue to be changed, Thunberg realized she needed to head back across the Atlantic sooner than expected, The New York Times reported.</p>

      <p>“It turns out I’ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way:) Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful,” she posted on Twitter on Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>She had originally planned to travel south to Chile by bus and boat.</p>
      <p>Thunberg told The Times she decided to sail back to Europe “to highlight the fact that you can't live sustainably in today’s society. You have to go to the extreme.”</p>
      <p>She will be sailing with Australian YouTubers Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu who live on a 48-foot catamaran and travel around the world with their baby.</p>
      <p>The trip should take around three weeks.</p>
