      <h1>Conversion rate a concern for Sunil Chhetri</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:48:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Hindol-Basu-479228353.cms" target="_blank">Hindol Basu</a></address>
      <p>NEW DELHI: Ahead of their back-to-back World Cup qualification matches against Afghanistan (November 14) and Oman (November 19), India captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sunil-chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a> is worried over the team's inability to convert easy chances into goals.</p>
      <p>After holding Qatar to a goalless draw, India had to split points with Bangladesh - a match they were expected to win. The Indian forwards spurned numerous opportunities before a late equaliser saved the day. Chhetri spoke exclusively to TOI about the campaign so far and what needs to be done in Dushanbe on Thursday as well as in Muscat on November 19.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Back-to-back World Cup qualifying games - is it a positive or will it wear down the boys?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's always a positive when you play for the country. Barring the Bangladesh game where we missed quite a few chances, and thereby lost an opportunity to take all three points, we have done well. All the boys are very much aware of the tough fixtures ahead, and they need to accept it when they're representing the country. We'll try our best to cope with it. We need to rest well, eat well and be prepared for the challenges ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Afghanistan are below India in FIFA ranking, but they won't be any pushovers?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We have already seen what happens when you think about the FIFA rankings. Almost everyone had predicted a win for us before we played against Bangladesh in Kolkata but something else happened. So, I don't pay much heed to rankings. If you would have asked anyone to predict the result prior to our game against Qatar, you must have got a different answer from what eventually happened in Doha.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If we win against Afghanistan, then can we expect another win in Oman? Or is it too much to ask for...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Facing Oman in Muscat is going to be a daunting task. Honestly, we're not thinking about Oman right now. Our focus is on the Afghanistan game on Thursday and once we pass that hurdle, we'll start thinking about Oman.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you think the opportunity was there to win against Bangladesh?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a huge opportunity. I am not being harsh, but I wish we could have converted those chances. It was a game where Bangladesh defended really well; but still, we managed to create lots of chances. Had we converted a few of them, we would've grabbed all three points. That's the area (converting chances) where we should really work on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Does the lack of goal scorers in the team worry you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is worrisome, but you must cut some slack. These boys are young and they're trying their best. With time, they'll excel.</p>
