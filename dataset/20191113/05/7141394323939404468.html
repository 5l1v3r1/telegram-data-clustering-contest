      <p>Jack Dorsey is on the road in Africa. The tech billionaire who founded Twitter and Square just tweeted a “Bitcoin Africa” list to his 4.3 million followers as he continues to explore ways to support the adoption of cryptocurrency, innovation and entrepreneurship worldwide.</p>
      <p>Last month Dorsey, a Bitcoin bull, told his Twitter followers that he would be traveling for the month of November.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Headed to Africa for all of November! Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa. Going to spend a lot of time with entrepreneurs.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He spent one morning at Ventures Park in Nigeria, a global community fostering innovation by offering co-working spaces and community activities for entrepreneurs, and recently joined a Bitcoin group in Ghana.</p>

      <p>Africa is a Bitcoin hot spot, trending globally as the world’s top location for the highest number of searches for the king coin, according to <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin">Google Trends</a>.</p>
      <p>Nigeria is in the lead with an index of 100 compared to South Africa in second place with an index of 42 and Ghana in fourth place at 40. The three African countries round out the top five with Austria and Switzerland in third and fourth places over the past 30 days.</p>

      <p>Google Trends also shows Africa leading in Bitcoin searches over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>Dorsey is committed to developing Bitcoin for mainstream users. He launched <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/07/29/jack-dorseys-square-crypto-prizes-bitcoin-as-the-product-were-focusing-on/">Square Crypto</a> earlier this year to focus on the cryptocurrency, which he believes is suited to become the global currency of the internet.</p>
      <p>While the visionary prepares for a crypto future where money moves as seamlessly as email without the fees and friction of the traditional banking system or the inconvenience of having to exchange one country’s paper money for another, he says that Bitcoin is not yet functional as a currency.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/how-jack-dorsey-is-preparing-for-a-crypto-future-20190903-p52nfe">Australian Financial Review</a> in a story published in September,</p>

        <i>“The peaks and troughs [of Bitcoin] are like an investment asset and are equivalent to gold…</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>What we need to do is make it more usable and accessible as a currency, but it’s not there yet.”</i>
