        <b>India's Test regular Ajinkya Rahane believes that he will back in the ODI squad if he continues to perform consistently in Tests. Rahane was a regular in India's ODI setup till the 2015 World Cup but a slump in form saw him getting dropped and losing his place to the likes of Rahul and Rayudu.</b>

      <p>Indian Test batsman <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ajinkya_rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a> has not played an ODI for India for more than a year, yet believes that he is still in the reckoning for the much-debated number four spot in the Indian batting line-up. India's semifinal loss to New Zealand in the World Cup exposed the team's inexperience in the middle order and Rahane could prove to be the perfect experienced foil for youngsters like <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shreyas_iyer">Shreyas </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/iyer">Iyer</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rishabh_pant">Rishabh </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a> to come down the batting order and express themselves.</p>
      <p>Rahane was dropped from the side when <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ms_dhoni">MS Dhoni</a> was still the ODI skipper and one of the reasons pointed was his inability to rotate the strike in middle-overs. Rahane was again given a chance at number four in India's tour to South Africa and he had shown some promise but lack of consistency is what made him lose his place. However, he is still hopeful that a good Test season will again put him in the selectors' radar for the middle-order spot.</p>
      <p>"I just need to play well in the Test matches, keep scoring runs and I am confident that I will be back in the ODI side," Rahane was quoted as saying by Sportstar.Â </p>
      <p>"It is all about self-belief and being confident. Staying in the present will help me, if I contribute to the side's cause in Tests, I am sure I will be back in the ODI squad," he added.</p>
      <p>India clearly start as favorites in the two-match Test series but Rahane, as humble as he is , believes that the team needs to stay in the present and not take any opposition lightly.</p>
      <p>"We are focussing on the Indore Test right now. I thought we played really well against South Africa, but as a side, we must stay in the present and we do not take any opponent lightly," he asserted.</p>
      <p>Rahane also expressed his excitement about India playing with the pink ball for the first time and believes that it is a new challenge that the team will cherish to adapt to.</p>
      <p>"I am very excited personally. It is a new challenge. I don't know how it will turn out but we will get an idea when we have a couple of practice sessions. Only then we will get an idea of how much the pink ball swings and how it works session wise," he said.</p>
      <p>"Fans perspective wise also it will be interesting. I think as a batsman lateral movement will be there and it will be best if you play late, that is my personal idea. Adapting shouldn't be a problem," he concluded.</p>
