      <h1>Karnataka: SC upholds Speaker's decision to disqualify 17 MLAs; SC says they can contest by-polls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:35:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror Online</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the order of former Karnataka Assembly speaker of disqualifying 17 MLAs. <br/><br/>Deprecating the manner in which these disqualified Karnataka MLAs directly approached the apex court without first moving the High Court, the Supreme court said that it cannot 'encourage' these actions. <br/><br/>The disqualified Congress-JD (S) MLAs had challenged the orders of the then Assembly Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar to disqualify them, ruling that those disqualified cease to be MLAs with immediate effect till the expiry of the 15th assembly (in 2023). <br/><br/>However striking down a portion of the Speaker's order, in a relief to them, the court said that the disqualified legislators can contest by-elections but can't hold ministerial portfolios till then. <br/><br/>Untitled Carousel</p>

We are confident that we will win in bypolls." <br/><br/>Bypolls to 15 of 17 seats represented by disqualified MLAs, whose resignation and absence from the trust vote led to the fall of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government, made way for the BJP to come to power, will be held on December 5. <br/><br/><br/>Congress has expressed confidence about winning a minimum of 12 out of 15 assembly seats in Karnataka.</p>
