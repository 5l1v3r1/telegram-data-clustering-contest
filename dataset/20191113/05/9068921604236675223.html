      <p>Apple is celebrating Thanksgiving this year by urging U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a> owners to bag a special achievement by recording a minimum walking or running distance on Thursday, November 28.</p>

      <p>As with past holidays, ‌Apple Watch‌ owners can earn an exclusive badge and an iMessage sticker if they complete the challenge. <br/><br/>To earn the turkey-themed badge and sticker, ‌Apple Watch‌ wearers must clock up a 5-kilometer (3.1 mile) walk, run, or wheelchair workout. Apple's Thanksgiving Day challenge was first spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/kylesethgray/status/1194409233573269504?s=20">Kyle Seth Gray</a>, who shared his discovery on Twitter. <br/><br/>To record the activity, wearers need to use Apple's stock Workout app or a third-party app that feeds data to Apple's HealthKit. An ‌‌Apple Watch‌‌ user's history of achievements can be viewed any time via the Achievements tab on the iOS Activity app. <br/><br/>Apple first challenged ‌Apple Watch‌ owners to get out on Thanksgiving Day in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/21/apple-watch-thanksgiving-day-achievement/">2016</a>, and then again in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/21/apple-watch-thanksgiving-day-badge/">2017</a>, but no challenge was forthcoming in 2018. <br/><br/>Thanksgiving is a U.S. holiday, so the challenge obviously won't show up for ‌Apple Watch‌ users set to other regions. The last special activity challenge Apple promoted occurred on Monday for Veterans Day.</p>
