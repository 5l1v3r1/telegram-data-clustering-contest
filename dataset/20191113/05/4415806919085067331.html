      <p>She said: “It’s the medication I have to take for the rest of my life – it depends on even the month, to be honest.</p>
      <p>“So for me, I really noticed when people started attacking me for that. And in reality, that’s just my truth. I fluctuate. It depends what’s happening in my life.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on Raquelle Stevens’s podcast Giving Back Generation, Gomez added: “That got to me big time. That really messed me up for a bit.”</p>
      <p>Gomez, who is back in the charts with her singles Lose You To Love Me and Look At Her Now, said she is currently “very happy with living my life” and limits her time with social media.</p>
