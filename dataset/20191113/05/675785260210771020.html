      <h1>UK weather forecast: Snow blast of up to 5cm to hit amid 'danger to life' floods</h1>
      <h2>The Met Office has issued a rain warning for south-west England and south Wales today, with snowfall possible in these areas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:49:42+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:49</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Up to 5cm of snow could fall in parts of the UK today as rain and sleet ravage the country.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has issued a rain <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning for south Wales and parts of south-west England, with snowfall possible in these regions today.</p>
      <p>The weather alert, which is in force from 5pm to midnight tonight, states that these areas may see flooding today.</p>
      <p>Another 'danger to life' flooding warning, covering much of England and Wales, has been issued for tomorrow, when almost half a month's rainfall is expected. </p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has 35 flood warnings and 80 less serious flood alerts in force today.</p>
      <p>Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson told Mirror Online: "It will be a cold day later in the afternoon to evening, with a band of rain in Wales and south-west England which could bring snow, particularly in south Wales.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"At around 400 metres or above we could see up to five centimetres of snow, in places like the Brecon Beacons.</p>
      <p>"There's less of a risk in the south-west, there could be sleet and wet snow over the moors.</p>
      <p>"We also have rain warnings through Wednesday and Thursday. Locally some spots through Thursday could see 60mm of rain. That could lead to flooding."</p>
      <p>Mr Wilson added that snowfall is also possible on Thursday and Friday on higher ground, particularly in the north.</p>
      <p>Tonight there will be cloud and patchy rain across Northern Ireland, Wales, southern and south-west England, along with dry spells in Scotland, northern and eastern England.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow will be cold but dry with spells of sunshine in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England.</p>
