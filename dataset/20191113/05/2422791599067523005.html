      <p>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. -- Police say they have identified and charged a suspect wanted in the fatal stabbing of a man outside a Popeyes restaurant in Maryland.</p>
      <p>The Prince George's County Police Department said in news release Tuesday that 30-year-old Ricoh McClain is wanted on murder charges in the death of 28-year-old Kevin Tyrell Davis.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Hank Stawinski has said only 15 seconds elapsed from when the Nov. 4 altercation started to when it ended with the stabbing. Stawinski said Davis had been "methodically" cutting the line for the rereleased chicken sandwiches for 15 minutes before McClain confronted him.</p>
      <p>McClain is considered armed and dangerous and police say to call 911 if he's seen.</p>
      <p>Popeyes resumed selling its chicken sandwich Nov. 3. It was first released in August.</p>
