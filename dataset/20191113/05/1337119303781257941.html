      <h1>Podcasts are now available on Pandora’s website and desktop app</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T05:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dani-deahl" target="_blank">Dani Deahl</a></address>
      <p>As of today, Podcasts on Pandora are now available for all users on the Pandora website and on its desktop app for Mac and Windows. The company first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129052/pandora-podcast-genome-project-personalized-recommendations">launched podcasts on its app last year</a>, leveraging its Podcast Genome Project, an offshoot of Pandora’s Music Genome Project, which can personalize podcast recommendations down to an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18090980/pandora-podcast-genome-project-public-beta">individual episode level</a>.</p>
      <p>Pandora is banking on this hyper-personalization, and says its system uses more than 1,500 attributes — from the show’s MPAA ratings to a user’s listening history — to drill down on shows it thinks you’d like to listen to, along with specific episodes. This is mostly done with the Podcast Genome Project’s algorithms, but there’s still a human curation component involved to help guide recommendations.</p>
      <p>Since launching podcasts in 2018, Pandora says its podcast offerings have grown from around 100,000 episodes to over 600,000 episodes, spread across a variety of genres like comedy, music, news, and more. Backing this effort, the platform also introduced its self-service <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/us/pandora-for-podcasters-submit-your-podcast-connect-with-listeners-and-tell-your-story-in-just-a-few-easy-steps/">Pandora for Podcasters online hub</a> earlier this year, providing a centralized place for podcast creators to submit their shows for inclusion in Pandora’s catalog.</p>
