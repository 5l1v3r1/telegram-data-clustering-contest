      <p>It may be a kid's dream come true - a man received a response to a message in a bottle he sent nine years ago.<br/><br/>Max Vredenburgh wrote a note saying, "I'm 10 years old. I like apples, I like the beach. My favorite color is blue. I like outer space. Please write back."<br/><br/>He threw it into the ocean in Massachusetts in 2010 and a man who found it on a beach in France responded to him.<br/><br/>"When I first read his letter, my stomach just dropped. I feel I have a higher chance of winning the lottery than this happening," Vredenburgh said.<br/><br/>The letter, signed by "G. Dubois," said it took nine years to cover the 6,000 kilometers that separates them.<br/><br/>Vredenburgh wanted to learn more about the mystery Frenchman so he shared his story on social media. It quickly went viral.<br/><br/>He and Mr. DuBois have since connected on Instagram.</p>
