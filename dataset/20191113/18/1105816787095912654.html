      <h1>ISPR says no truth in reports of amendment to Army Act</h1>

      <p>The Pakistan Army on Wednesday quelled speculation over amending the Army Act to implement the International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict on self-confessed Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav.</p>
      <p>“Speculations for amendment in Pakistan Army Act to implement International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict regarding convicted Indian terrorist Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav are incorrect,” Major General Asif Ghafoor, the director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said in a tweet.</p>

      <p>“Various legal options for review and reconsideration of the case are being considered. Final status shall be shared in due course of time,” he added.</p>
      <p>Jadhav — a serving commander of the Indian Navy associated with spy agency Research and Analysis Wing — was arrested in 2016 from Balochistan on allegations of espionage and terrorism.</p>
      <p>In his trial at a military court, Jadhav had confessed to his involvement in terrorism, and was sentenced to death in 2017.</p>
      <p>The ICJ, after being approached by India, had ordered a stay in his execution through an interim order.</p>
      <p>In its verdict earlier this year, the international court ruled that Jadhav be allowed consular access, and asked Pakistan to ensure “effective review and reconsideration of his conviction and sentences”.</p>
      <p>Other remedies sought by India, which included the annulment of Jadhav’s sentence, and securing his release; however, were rejected.</p>
