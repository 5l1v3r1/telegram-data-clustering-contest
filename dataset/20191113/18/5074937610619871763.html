      <p>Accra, Nov 13, GNA - NPP Ladies, a vibrant group within the Women’s Wing of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) has showered praises on President Akufo-Addo and the MP for Tema West, Carlos Kingsley Ahenkorah, following the successful organisation LADIES of a training programme that was backed by the two as patrons.</p>
      <p>In a fanfare of praises, the ladies celebrated the President and MP as champions of the welfare of women in the constituency saying they were leaders that the Constituency’s women could trust to provide solutions.</p>
      <p>“Have you seen the faces of our hardworking ladies, who have decided to avail themselves of the free training programme? It should tell you that everybody is happy for the opportunity.</p>
      <p>“President Akufo-Addo has the thanks of the women of Lashibi, the women of Baatsonaa, Sakumono, Adjei Kojo and even the women of Tema because when we cried out to him, he did not ignore us. He sent our MP, Carlos Ahenkorah with a solution,” Ms Roselyn D. Ayittey, President of Tema Noble Ladies said on the sidelines of a  training programme for women at Baatsonaa.</p>
      <p>It was held on the theme; “Skills Training – A Tool for Bridging The Unemployment Gap,” was used to train women of the Constituency in artisanal skills such as soap making and dressmaking at Baatsonaa.</p>
      <p>500 women from areas in the Constituency including; Lashibi, Sakumono, Adjei Kojo and Baatsonaa were beneficiaries of the training programme.</p>
      <p>“All the items that we are using for the programme were donated by Mr Carlos Ahenkorah on behalf of President Akufo-Addo. I just wrote to him expressing concern about the fact that many of our women in the constituency were unskilled and jobless, and quickly he got us all of these,  that is why we are celebrating him in our numbers”. Madam Dwumoh Bonsu said.</p>
      <p> Among others, the MP donated 200 dual desk furniture, math sets, and waste bins.</p>
      <p>Mr Carlos Ahenkorah himself was there as special guest of honour. As the MP’s security detail used the best of their skills to hold back the mobbing crowd, the women chanted victory songs for President Akufo-Addo and Carlos Ahenkorah referring to Carlos as their father who had come bearing gifts.</p>
      <p>“The MP would later praise the President as the caring leader to whom all the praise is due. “Yes, I was the one who was approached with the request for help and I made the donations, but the inspiration came from the President,” Carlos Ahenkorah said.</p>
      <p>He said he was happy that women from all corners of the constituency were beneficiaries of the training programme, “because in this constituency, you the constituents are the reason why we are in office as servants”.</p>
      <p>He pledged to continue to serve his people with humility, saying in the next NPP government, the women will see even more care from President Akufo-Addo.</p>
      <p>Mrs.  Akua Okunor, Chairperson of Queens Coastal Drive, a group within the NPP also praised President Akufo-Addo and  Mr Ahenkorah for changing lives.</p>
      <p>“Nobody has said that things are absolutely perfect, but we can all testify that so much has changed for us women and indeed for all parents. Free SHS for instance has taken the burden of paying school fees away from us parents,” she said.</p>
      <p>She saluted the government, vowing that they would do all that they could to ensure the re-election of President Akufo-Addo and Carlos Ahenkorah in 2020.</p>
      <p>Ms Edem Attipoe, Constituency Women’s Organizer for Tema West said she was happy for the massive attendance of the programme and affirmed Mrs. Okunor’s pledge to fight till the NPP was re-elected in 2020. “I simply prefer Carlos Ahenkorah to others” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms. Mariama Kwakye Offei, a Polling Station Women Organizer said “Mr. Carlos Ahenkorah’s performance as MP and Deputy Minister was the best so far and his retention as parliamentary Candidate and MP would be as easy.</p>
      <p>“He will whip everyone in all future elections because of his good works. Why shouldn’t we celebrate such a good MP”</p>
