      <p>Rapper Kodak Black was sentenced to nearly four years in prison Wednesday on federal weapons charges, <a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/11/13/south-florida-rapper-kodak-black-sentencing-federal-weapons-charges/">CBS Miami reported</a>. The rapper, whose real name is Bill K. Kapri, pleaded guilty in August to two counts of knowingly making a false and fictitious written statement in order to "unlawfully acquire firearms."</p>
      <p>U.S. District Judge Federico A. Moreno sentenced Kodak Black to 46 months in prison, along with 3 years of supervised release. In May, prosecutors charged the 23-year-old rapper, from Pompano Beach, for crimes that involve falsifying information on federal forms to purchase three firearms.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said one of the weapons purchased by Black was found at the scene of a shooting in Pompano Beach. A federal judge denied his request for bond saying he was "danger to the community" based on his lengthy criminal record.</p>
      <p>The Grammy-nominated rapper also faces drug, weapons and sexual assault charges in other states.</p>
