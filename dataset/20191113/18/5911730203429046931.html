      </p>
      <p>A Pasco County Sheriff’s arrest report says the victim was burned beyond recognition after playing cards with Michael Psilakis, 21, in October. Investigators haven’t released the victim’s name, citing Marsy’s Law, a state constitutional amendment designed to protect crime victims.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office says the body and vehicle were found in the woods Friday afternoon east of Baillies Bluff Road near Key Vista Nature Park.</p>

      <p>A witness told investigators he’d played cards with the pair and Psilakis lost $3,500. The witness said Psilakis asked him whether he should kill the victim.</p>
      <p>Initially, as part of the investigation, deputies arrested Psilakis at his mother's home in Port Richey because he was found driving a stolen vehicle with a gun inside.</p>
      <p>According to the sheriff's office, he fought deputies when they tried to arrest him and he tried to run away after he was handcuffed.</p>
      <p>Psilakis is charged with murder. He’s being held without bond. Records don’t list an attorney who could be contacted to comment for Psilakis.</p>
