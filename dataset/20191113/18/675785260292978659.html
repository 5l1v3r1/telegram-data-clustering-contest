      <h1>Gylfi Sigurdsson issues rallying cry to Everton teammates after win against Southampton</h1>
      <h2>The Toffees have climbed up to 15th in the table after two positive results and next face bottom club Norwich ahead of a tricky run of fixtures in December</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:06:06+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Gylfi Sigurdsson claims it is time for Everton to climb the Premier League table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> have risen out of the drop zone to 15th on the back of their mini-revival and Sigurdsson claims they must build on this momentum ahead of their next game against Norwich.</p>
      <p>Norwich visit Goodison Park on Saturday week and Daniel Farke’s Canaries have the worst away record in the Premier League with just one point from six games.</p>
      <p>Sigurdsson, 30, was heartened by Everton’s positive results in their last two games before the international break and says they must keep going.</p>
      <p>“It’s extremely important to build from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> game going forward,” said the Icelandic star.</p>

      <p>“It was a strong showing to get the equaliser against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a>, followed by three points against Southampton.</p>
      <p>“There are some tough games ahead of us. We have Norwich at home next and then four very tough games on the way.</p>
      <p>“There’s not much to choose between many of the clubs.</p>
      <p>“It’s time for us to start climbing up the table.”</p>
      <p>Everton are only three points behind fifth-placed Sheffield United and Sigurdsson claims they could shoot up the table on the back of a run of wins.</p>
      <p>“There are only three points between ourselves and fifth place, which is really amazing considering how things have been with us,” said the playmaker.</p>

      <p>“The league is such that if you put together three results in a row you will jump up four or five places.</p>
      <p>“There are lots of games ahead and it's a fun time when there is little time for training but plenty of games.”</p>
      <p>Pressure had mounted on manager Marco Silva after they lost four Premier League games in a row, but the Toffees are now unbeaten in their last three in all competitions.</p>
