      <p>London - Manchester City star <b>Bernardo Silva</b> has been suspended for one match and fined £50,000 for a tweet he posted comparing teammate Benjamin Mendy with a black cartoon character, the Football Association announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In September Silva tweeted an image of a young Mendy alongside an image of the character representing the Spanish chocolate peanut brand Conguitos, before deleting it 46 minutes later.</p>
      <p>There was no hearing after Silva admitted the misconduct charge, and acknowledged some people may be offended by the "historical connotations of the Conguitos character".</p>
      <p>"The player did not himself intend the post to be insulting or in any way racist," read the report from the FA Commission.</p>
      <p>"It is clear that the tweet was intended to be no more than a joke between close friends. However, this was not a private jocular communication between two friends.</p>
      <p>"The post was on a social media platform exposed to the 600,000 followers of a high-profile and well-respected professional footballer."</p>
      <p>Silva has been one of City's standout performers this season as the defending champions have struggled to keep pace with leaders Liverpool, trailing them by nine points after Sunday's 3-1 defeat at Anfield.</p>
      <p>He will miss a tough home match with third-placed Chelsea - who are a point better off than City - on November 23.</p>
