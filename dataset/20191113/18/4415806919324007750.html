      <p>Phage therapy – which involves using viruses to destroy bacteria – could help treat liver disease caused by alcohol, scientists say.</p>
      <p>Experiments on mice have shown that targeting “a precise cocktail of phages” at a specific type of gut bacteria known as Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) can get rid of alcoholic hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.</p>
      <p>Based on the findings, published in the journal Nature, researchers are calling for the treatment to be expanded so it can be tested in human clinical trials.</p>
      <p>A team of scientists, from King’s College London and the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, found that E. faecalis releases a toxin called cytolysin, which can damage liver cells.</p>
      <p>While this bacteria is generally present in low numbers in a healthy human gut, the researchers found that people with alcoholic hepatitis have more cytolysin-producing E. faecalis in their guts than healthy people.</p>
      <p>To investigate if phage therapy would work, the researchers isolated four different phages that specifically target cytolysin-producing E. faecalis.</p>
      <p>According to the researchers, their “precise cocktail of phages” was able to get rid of the bacteria in mice and eradicate alcohol-induced liver disease.</p>
      <p>Bernd Schnabl, a professor of medicine and gastroenterology at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and senior author on the study, said: “We not only linked a specific bacterial toxin to worse clinical outcomes in patients with alcoholic liver disease, we found a way to break that link by precisely editing gut microbiota with phages.”</p>

      <p>The research also found that around 90% of cytolysin-positive patients with alcoholic hepatitis died within six months of hospital admission, compared to approximately 4% of cytolysin-negative patients.</p>
      <p>Prof Schnabl added: “Based on this finding, we believe detection of the cytolysin-gene in faeces from patients with alcoholic hepatitis could be a very good biomarker for liver disease severity and risk of death.”</p>
      <p>Alcoholic hepatitis is generally treated with corticosteroids, and in critical cases, liver transplantation may be recommended.</p>
      <p>In 2017, alcoholic liver disease accounted for 80% of the 5,843 alcohol-specific deaths in the UK, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.</p>
      <p>With antibiotic-resistant infections on the rise, scientists have renewed their interest in phage therapy.</p>
      <p>Professor Debbie Shawcross, professor of hepatology and chronic liver failure at King’s College London and one of the study authors, said: “This novel avenue of research now needs to be expanded to test the safety and effectiveness of phage therapy in human clinical trials in patients with alcohol-related disease.</p>
      <p>“It is also likely that other forms of chronic liver disease associated with changes in the gut microbiome will also benefit from this novel approach, such as fatty liver disease.”</p>
