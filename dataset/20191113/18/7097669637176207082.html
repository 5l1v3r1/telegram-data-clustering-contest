      <p>These Republicans aren't sure where House Republicans are going with this thing.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Ambassador William Taylor and top State Department official George Kent appeared before the House Intelligence Committee for a public hearing regarding President Trump's dealings with Ukraine. And when Ranking Member Devin Nunes launched his questioning of Taylor with a <a href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1194675824559087616">string of conspiracy theorie</a>s, <i>The View</i> co-host Abby Huntsman, daughter of former Republican governor of Utah and longtime diplomat Jon Huntsman, immediately voiced her concerns.</p>

      <p>And while Republican strategist Ana Navarro-CÃ¡rdenas did <a href="https://twitter.com/ananavarro/status/1194683607723495424">praise both parties' decisions</a> to let outside counsels handle most of the questioning, she didn't love when Nunes got the mic.</p>
