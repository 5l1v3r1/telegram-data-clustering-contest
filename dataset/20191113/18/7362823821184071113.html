      <h1>Boris Johnson shows off tea-making skills, stirs outrage when he adds milk with bag still in mug</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:03:31+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Sorace</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">British</a> Prime Minister <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson’s</a> tea-making skills stirred some controversy Tuesday after an election video showed the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe/brexit">Brexit</a> leader pouring milk into his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink">tea</a> without first taking the bag out of the mug.</p>
      <p>The apparent faux-pas was spotted as Johnson <a href="https://www.facebook.com/borisjohnson/videos/428966838000510/">answered a wide range of questions</a>, from how he starts his day to the challenges facing Britain and why parliament has called for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-parliament-agrees-to-dec-12-election-ahead-of-eus-new-brexit-deadline">general election on Dec. 12</a>. His answers, however, were overshadowed by a cup of tea.</p>

      <p>“Is this real,” a user <a href="https://twitter.com/TrudyTrudy11/status/1194340134902218752">asked</a> on Twitter. “He left the teabag in the cup. How can he run the country when he can’t even make a proper brew?!?”</p>

      <p>Another user who appeared to be a supporter of the Tory leader wrote: “Well done Boris! Only issue with this video... Next time take the tea bag out before milk goes in."</p>
      <p>Johnson later <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1194337977339695106">responded</a> on Twitter for those steeped in interest over his tea preparation, writing: “This is really how I make my tea. It lets it brew and makes it stronger.”</p>

      <p>Johnson unwittingly brewed a debate about tea etiquette online. Some users sided with Johnson, writing they used a similar procedure when making tea, while others said they just enjoyed the pure spectacle of their prime minister’s technique.</p>

      <p>“I was mesmerized by it,” one <a href="https://twitter.com/LucyTrims/status/1194401229352439808">wrote</a>. “Was happy to see you didn’t add too much milk but was getting quite stressed by that teabag left bobbing about. It felt like I missed an ending, I needed closure on the teabag..."</p>

      <p>Last month, Johnson <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/boris-johnson-coffee-disposable-cup">made headlines for another hot drink debacle</a>. While on camera, an aide handed Johnson a hot drink in a paper cup only to have another aide snatch it away and say, “No disposable cups.”</p>
