      <p>This out-of-this-world trip through space and time will transport viewers across 13.8 billion years of cosmic evolution and deep into the future.</p>
      <p>The next chapter of Cosmos<b>, </b>announced in celebration of what would have been visionary <b>Carl Sagan</b>’s 85th birthday on Nov. 9, continues the legacy of the ground-breaking series co-written with <b>Ann Druyan</b> and <b>Steven Soter</b></p>
      <p>, which was broadcast to a global audience 40 years ago. </p>
      <p>
        <i>Cosmos: Possible Worlds</i>
      </p>
      <p> airs on National Geographic in 172 countries and 43 languages. The previous season was seen by over 135 million people worldwide.</p>
      <p> This Emmy-winning, worldwide phenomenon is the brainchild of Emmy and Peabody Award winner <b>Ann</b> <b>Druyan</b>, creative director of NASA’s legendary Voyager Interstellar Message, who serves as creator, executive producer, writer and director, and Emmy-winning and Academy Award-nominated executive producers <b>Seth MacFarlane</b> (<i>The Orville</i>, <i>Family Guy</i>), <b>Brannon Braga</b> (<i>The Orville</i>, <i>Star Trek</i>) and <b>Jason Clark</b> (<i>The Orville</i>, <i>The Long Road Home</i></p>
      <p>).</p>
      <p> <b>Neil deGrasse Tyson</b>, an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History, host of the four-time Emmy-nominated <i>StarTalk </i>series and best-selling author (<i>Death by Black Hole</i>, <i>Letters from an Astrophysicist</i></p>
      <p>), returns as host and series executive science editor. </p>
      <p>This season begins with him on the shores of the cosmic ocean as <i>Cosmos’</i> enhanced and upgraded ‘Ship of the Imagination’ and ‘Cosmic Calendar’ return, taking viewers on a journey through time and spanning a stunning variety of worlds. Throughout these adventurous episodes, <i>Cosmos: Possible Worlds </i></p>
      <p>integrates one-of-a-kind VFX, animations, holograms and stylized reenactments to carry viewers to never-before-seen worlds and meet unsung superheroes who have made possible our understanding of life’s spectacular voyage —from its origin at the bottom of the sea to its possible future on the exotic worlds of distant stars.</p>
      <p> “This third season of <i>Cosmos: Possible Worlds</i></p>
      <p> is our boldest yet,” says Druyan. “The ‘Ship of the Imagination’ will carry us places we never dared to venture before: lost worlds and worlds to come, deep into the future and straight through that hole in the curtain masking other realities – and all of it rigorously informed by science and made real by lavish VFX.”</p>
      <p>“National Geographic is proud to be the world’s leading destination for viewers who are passionate about science and exploration,” says Courteney Monroe, president of global television networks at National Geographic. “Which is why we’re excited for the next chapter of the most-beloved and most-watched science show to date, <i>Cosmos</i>, to return to our air. <i>Cosmos: Possible Worlds</i></p>
      <p> takes complex themes from astrophysics, astronomy and anthropology and makes them accessible and entertaining for millions of people around the world to devour.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Cosmos: Possible Worlds</i>
      </p>
      <p> ventures to previously uncharted territories: starting back to the dawning of our universe, moving forward to the futuristic 2039 New York World’s Fair and then far beyond into the distant future on other worlds. Visit an open house in the first apartment ever built and climb a 10,000-year-old stairway to the stars. Return to the foreboding ‘Halls of Extinction,’ with living dioramas of the broken branches on the tree of life, and venture to the new, glorious ‘Palace of Life,’ with its soaring towers filled with vibrant marine creatures. Stand beneath its ‘Arch of Experience’ to know what it’s like to soar with the eagles or swim with the whales on their epic voyages.</p>
