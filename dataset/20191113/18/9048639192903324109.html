      <p><b>NEW YORK (AP) —</b> An indictment charging California attorney Michael Avenatti with conspiring to extort Nike has been rewritten to drop two conspiracy counts.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Avenatti said he was “extremely pleased” and expects eventually to be “fully exonerated.”</p>
      <p>The refreshed indictment returned Wednesday in Manhattan federal court adds an honest services wire fraud charge.</p>
      <p>Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to charges he committed extortion by threatening to publicly reveal dirty dealings by Nike in college athletics if he wasn’t paid up to $25 million.</p>
      <p>Avenatti also faces fraud charges in Los Angeles federal court and in a separate New York case after he was charged with cheating porn star Stormy Daniels of book deal income. Avenatti once represented Daniels over a nondisclosure deal regarding an alleged affair with President Donald Trump.</p>
