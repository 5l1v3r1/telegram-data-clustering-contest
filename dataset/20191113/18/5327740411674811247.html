      <p>“We intend to ask Minister [Rob] Fleming to direct the parties to remain at the table and resolve the strike as soon as possible,” says an email from student Grace Warren.</p>
      <p>“If that cannot be done, we will be asking Minister Fleming to introduce return-to-work legislation and allow for classes to resume while an arbitrator works with the parties to reach a resolution.”</p>

      <p>More than 7,000 students within the district have been home from school since the job action started on Oct. 28.</p>
      <p>The main sticking point for unionized support staff is low wages, with the union asking for them to be brought in line with those in surrounding school districts.</p>
