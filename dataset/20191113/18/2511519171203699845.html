He confirms that investigations into allegations of corruption at the company were ongoing long before Mr Biden joined the board and that those had been largely settled by the time the former vice president's son joined the board.</p>

Bush). Moreover, it’s not unusual for people without energy experience to be on the board of energy companies. No one on the board of ExxonMobil other than the CEO, for example, is an expert on oil or gas."</i></p>
