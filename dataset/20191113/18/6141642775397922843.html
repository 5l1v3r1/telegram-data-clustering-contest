      <p>Harry Maguire insists there are no cliques in the England camp as the squad look to move on from Monday’s spat between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate has prided himself on removing any lingering issues between players from rival clubs when they meet up for international duty.</p>
      <p>But a fracas in the week leading up to England’s 1000th fixture – a Euro 2020 qualifier at home to Montenegro where a draw would be enough to secure progression to the finals – saw questions asked as to whether those divides had returned.</p>
      <p>Sterling’s exchange with Liverpool defender Gomez less than 24 hours after the pair clashed towards the end of Manchester City’s 3-1 loss to the Premier League leaders has dominated the build up to the landmark fixture.</p>

      <p>With club rivalry spilling out into international week, suggestions that splits in the camp may exist were extinguished by Maguire on the eve of the game.</p>
      <p>“No, everybody mixes,” the Manchester United defender replied when asked if there were any cliques in the current squad.</p>
      <p>“I think you’ve seen how good the unity in the squad is over the last couple of years.</p>
      <blockquote>He's apologised and like I've said and like Gareth has said, we've moved on from it now, we're not looking at that<cite>Harry Maguire</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“It’s been a good two years and the group has grown together. We continue to keep on growing and that’s really important.</p>
      <p>“No, definitely no cliques, we all share tables and share jokes and laughs together.</p>
      <p>“I think you’ve seen in Raheem’s statement (issued after the clash with Gomez) that he’s brought out, that the emotion probably got the better of him.</p>
      <p>“He’s apologised and like I’ve said and like Gareth has said, we’ve moved on from it now, we’re not looking at that.</p>
      <p>“We’ve moved on since Monday and we’ve trained hard; fully focused on the game because it’s a big game. We want to qualify for the Euros. And that’s what we’re aiming to do now.”</p>

      <p>“It would be really special to play in a major tournament and walking out at Wembley would be something that you dream of,” he added.</p>
      <p>“People say it would give us a little advantage as well. We know that the crowd get right behind us at Wembley and the support over the last few years – especially since I’ve been playing – has been unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big game tomorrow night and one that we’re all looking forward to and we feel prepared for.”</p>
