      <p>A midwife was arrested for an 'over the top film kiss' while on a Thomas Cook the flight to the Carribean.</p>
      <p>Passengers complained to flight staff after spotting Diane Gill engaged in some intense airborne kissing.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old had locked tongues with her partner in an amorous manner that fellow holiday makers found "inappropriate", <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/diane-gill-thomas-cook-bolton-17248538">Manchester Evening News reported</a> .</p>
      <p>When Gill found out that her tonsil tennis had been reported to the cabin crew, she started to hurl abuse at those near her while demanding to know who had complained.</p>
      <p>When the plane landed in the Dominican Republic Gill and her partner were hauled off.</p>

      <p>They were made to fly home with another airline.</p>
      <p>She was hauled before a judge at Manchester Crown Court, and received a three month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.</p>
      <p>Gill, of Abbot Croft, Bolton, pleaded guilty to being drunk on an aircraft.</p>
      <p>The incident began when Gill boarded a Thomas Cook flight in May last year.</p>
      <p>While cabin crew had smelled alcohol on her, they did not believe it was enough to render her unfit to fly.</p>
      <p>At some point during the trans-Atlantic flight the couple began "kissing amorously", according to one shocked passenger.</p>

      <p>It was "like a film kiss with arms all wrapped around each other", according to another witness report.</p>
      <p>When asked to stop by a member of staff, they did.</p>
      <p>A few hours later Gill knelt on her seat and pointed her finger at the passenger behind her, demanding to know who had snitched.</p>
      <p>It was speculated that the bottle of champagne the couple bought midair and alcohol they had carried onto the plane with them contributed to their behaviour.</p>
      <p>When staff asked them to move from their seats in front of the emergency exits - on which passengers are required to assist in the event of an emergency - Gill and her partner initially refused.</p>
      <p>While they did later move, the plane's captain requested that police officers be at the Dominican airport to arrest them upon landing.</p>
