      <h2>The Globe Inn is now being advertised as a 'rare opportunity to buy an Exeter public house'</h2>

      <p>It has been four months since the doors of The Globe Inn in Newtown abruptly closed after the council imposed new licencing restrictions.</p>
      <p>The future of the site in Clifton Road has remained uncertain since, but it has now been confirmed it is up for sale and is being sold as pub for a guide price of £325,000.</p>
      <p>The pub is currently owned by Enterprise Inns and its last licensee was Ann Spence who ran it for 15 months prior.</p>
      <p>In July she told Devon Live how a review of The Globe Inn's licence following persistent complaints about noise and anti-social behaviour, which she described as not being ‘bad’, had made it impossible to make a success of the pub.</p>
      <p>Exeter City Council conduct the review in response to residents of Belmont Road and Albert Street claiming the way the pub is being run has severely impacted on their quality of life due to the behaviour of people drinking there and noise levels.</p>
      <p>A number of new licencing conditions were set out following the review including having two members of staff on duty at all times, no smoking or drinking in the street at the front of the pub, outside areas closing after 9pm and erecting a soundproof smoking shelter limited to five people at any one time after 9pm.</p>

      <p>The pub was also told it requires a log where people can come in and record complaints.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the outcome of the council’s licensing sub-committee, Ann returned to the pub and its windows were blacked out by taping black bin bags over them.</p>
      <p>Speaking of her shock at the time, Ann said: "It’s a heart wrench and I feel absolutely gutted. The council have said we have to have two members of staff on at all times, but the pub doesn’t take enough money to warrant it.</p>
      <p>“We have cut out all the entertainment and noise that we can, but it’s still not been good enough. Pubs need to put something on for people to get them out these days.</p>
      <p>“If this was a really horrendous pub, at the licence review the police and environmental health would have made representations but there was nothing from them.</p>
      <p>"They have followed up every complaint and they have never found anything to substantiate them.</p>
      <p>She added: “For the last few months it has been like fighting a losing battle.”</p>
      <p>The Globe Inn is now being advertised as a 'rare opportunity to buy an Exeter public house'.</p>
      <p>It is being sold through property consultants JLL and bids are invited by midday on election day - December 12.</p>
      <p>The agents have stated they expect lots of interest in the three-storey property close to the Triangle Car park.</p>
      <p>The property will be sold with vacant possession and comprises a ground floor public bar and games room, first floor function suite and private accommodation to include a three bedroom second floor flat. In addition there is customer parking and an enclosed beer garden.</p>
      <p>Speaking for JLL, Michael Easton said: "The Globe Inn closed earlier this year due to licencing restrictions and with notice given by the former tenant our client has decided to sell.</p>
      <p>"The Globe is an attractive property close to the city centre and offers a great opportunity for investment and to take full advantage of the position and trade areas available.</p>
      <p>"Freehold sites in the public house market for Exeter are very rare."</p>
