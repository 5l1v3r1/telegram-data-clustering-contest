      <p>Disney collectors and enthusiasts now have a chance to get their hands on decades of coveted Disney memorabilia dating back to the 1950s.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://vegalleries.com/releases/a-history-of-disneyland-walt-disney-world">History of Disneyland &amp; Walt Disney World</a> auction, hosted by Van Eaton Galleries, will offer a collection of more than 1,500 collectible relics from the Disney dynasty.</p>
      <p>The auction will take place Dec. 7-8 and will be preceded by an exhibit of celebrated artifacts from the collection. The exhibit will be open to the public until Dec. 6.</p>
      <p>Bidders will be able to vie for historic props, posters, and memorabilia from iconic rides such as the Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes original documents from the parks' founding, including a rare copy of Walt Disney's original pitch for financing the Disneyland park, containing descriptions and a hand-coloured map of what Disney expected the park to look like.</p>
      <p>"The auction offers the excitement of very rare items never sold before at auction, but also evokes a sense of nostalgia and sentimentality for those artists and performers whose work defined our popular culture," Mike Van Eaton, co-founder of Van Eaton Galleries, said in a statement. "We are honored to be able to offer such remarkable items to fans and collectors around the globe."</p>
      <p>Early documents will be auctioned off alongside whimsical theme park props, ride vehicles, art and iconic set pieces.</p>
      <p>Disney fans will easily recognize several pieces in the auction lineup, including two original animatronic tiki birds from the Enchanted Tiki Room at Disney World, hand-painted "stretch-paintings" from the Haunted Mansions in both Disney parks, and an Opening Day Guidebook signed by Walt Disney himself.</p>
