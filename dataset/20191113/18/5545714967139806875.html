      <p><i>We've got a copy of </i>The Angry Birds Movie 2<i> up for grabs in today's contest!</i></p>
      <p>The only cell phone games I've ever really played were early versions of Snake on flip phones (puke) and the occasional Picross-style puzzle game on my current phone. How the hell the industry blew up like it did is beyond me, but most things these days are. It's a consequence of getting older, for sure.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest successes from mobile games is definitely <i>Angry Birds</i>. So big is the franchise that we're on the second feature-length film based on the games! That's crazy. So let's give this copy of <i>The Angry Birds Movie 2</i> away and download some free-to-play games on our phones as it plays in the background, like a good modern human!</p>

      <p>I accidentally flung my ability to summarize movies too far, so I'll let you read this press material about the movie real quick.</p>
      <blockquote>The flightless angry birds and the scheming green piggies take their beef to the next level in <b>THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE 2</b>! When a new threat emerges that puts both Bird and Pig Island in danger, Red (Jason Sudeikis), Chuck (Josh Gad), Bomb (Danny McBride), and Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage) recruit Chuck's sister Silver (Rachel Bloom) and team up with pigs Leonard (Bill Hader), his assistant, Courtney (Awkwafina), and techpig, Garry (Sterling K. Brown), to forge an unsteady truce and form an unlikely super team to save their homes.</blockquote>
      <p>That new threat they're talking about? GLOBAL WARMING. That's right, I said it. Good luck with that one, piggies and birds.</p>

The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner.
