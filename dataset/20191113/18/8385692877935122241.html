      <p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday price</a> on this 75-inch VIZIO QLED TV right now.</p>
      <p>It can be yours for just $1499. Which is $800.99 off of its regular price. And it's also the lowest price that this TV has ever been. Making this a really great time to pick one up and add it to your home.</p>
      <p>This TV from VIZIO is a 75-inch QLED TV with 4K resolution. It's one of their more high-end TVs, and you're going to get a really great viewing experience out of it.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Of course, this is a QLED TV, so you're going to get some pretty incredible colors, including some really deep blacks. It can also get pretty bright, hitting 1200 nits of brightness, so you won't need to worry about it being too dark, even if there is a window nearby. There are 240 local dimming zones, which keeps the picture looking great, especially when watching darker movies and TV shows.</p>
      <p>There is Dolby Vision included, which will make your picture look even more incredible. There's support for HDR, HDR10, HLG and a few other HDR standards as well.</p>
      <p>Now inside this TV, you'll find VIZIO's SmartCast included. This is going to allow you to Cast your favorite movies and TV shows to your TV. Now it's note quite the same as an Android TV running the show here, but it is similar. And it's better than dealing with some proprietary operating system that probably won't support the apps you want to use on the TV.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It also supports Apple AirPlay 2 and has support for iTunes coming soon. So even for those that use Apple products, will be happy.</p>
      <p>You can pick up this 75-inch VIZIO QLED TV from Amazon <a href="https://geni.us/KUVAUC">by clicking here</a>, but you'd better hurry as this Black Friday price isn't going to last long.</p>
