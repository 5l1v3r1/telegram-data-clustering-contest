      <h1>Seoul court case starts over Tokyo's wartime sex slavery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:26:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Former South Korean wartime sex slaves went to court in Seoul Wednesday to demand compensation from the Japanese government, in a case that is likely to exacerbate tensions between the neighbours.</p>
      <p>Seoul and Tokyo are both major US allies, democracies and market economies faced with an overbearing China and nuclear-armed North Korea, but are locked in a bitter row over historical issues that has spiralled into a fully-fledged trade dispute.</p>
      <p>The first hearing in the case took place some three years after the 20 plaintiffs -- including victims and their family members -- filed their action, demanding compensation of 200 million won ($170,000) each.</p>
      <p>Mainstream historians say up to 200,000 women -- mostly from Korea, but also other parts of Asia including China -- were forced to become sex slaves, so-called "comfort women", for Japanese soldiers during World War II.</p>
      <p>Similar cases have previously been mounted in Japan, where courts have ruled against the plaintiffs.</p>
      <p>Tokyo insists that all compensation matters were settled by the 1965 treaty that normalised relations between the neighbours and a 2015 deal to "permanently" settle the decades-long dispute with a Japanese apology and a payment of 1 billion yen ($9.1 million) to survivors.</p>
      <p>Tokyo is boycotting the proceedings at the Seoul Central District Court, claiming sovereign immunity.Â </p>
      <p>"If Japan's conscience is clear, there is no reason why it shouldn't attend," Lee Yong-soo, one of the surviving victims, said before the hearing began.</p>
      <p>"Japan should attend these proceedings."</p>
      <p>The 2015 agreement sparked anger among some survivors seeking an explicit apology from the Japanese government, leading some to file the civil suit.</p>
      <p>"The 1965 treaty and the 2015 deal do not take away each victim's individual right to request compensation," Ryu Kwang-ok, one of the lawyers, told AFP.</p>
      <p>Many Koreans remain deeply resentful of Japan's colonial rule over the peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and in recent months a series of South Korean court rulings have ordered Japanese firms to pay for forced labour during World War II.</p>
