      <h1>Paste Studio Sampler #5 Features Charly Bliss, Shovels &amp; Rope, Ruston Kelly and More</h1>

      <p>Between our two studios in New York City and Atlanta, we host a lot of great musicians to play live sessions every month. To give our readers (and viewers) a small taste of what we really enjoyed from each month, we put together samplers filled with songs from our favorite sessions, which you can stream or download for free via our NoiseTrade platform.</p>
      <p>For October’s edition, we picked 12 tracks, which include some heavy-hitters like punk-pop outfit Charly Bliss, folk duo <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Shovels+%26+Rope">Shovels &amp; Rope</a>, British psych rockers Temples and plenty more. It even includes two celebrated, veteran punk bands—Sum 41 and Anti-Flag—plus renowned 25-year-old multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier and Atlanta-based rocker Mattiel, who released her supremely enjoyable debut album, <i>Satis Factory</i>, earlier this year.</p>
