      <p>The media and entertainment company owned by the Lopez Group said net income amounted to P2.26 billion in the first nine months of the year from P1.48 billion year-on-year. </p>
      <p>ABS-CBN generated consolidated revenues of P32 billion from advertising and consumer sales, up 8.6 percent on year. </p>
      <p>Advertising revenues increased 15 percent, attributable to both political placements and growth in regular advertising. Excluding political placements, regular advertising rose by 5.6 percent on year. </p>
      <p>Consumer sales increased P302 million mainly resulting from higher TVPlus Boxes sold and higher subscription revenues from Sky Cable.</p>
