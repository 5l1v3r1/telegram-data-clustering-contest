      <p>Estimating the cannabis market is highly speculative math. No one really knows the true value of cannabis companies, but with the legalization of marijuana in some parts of the U.S. and Canada, market valuations and acquisition deals keep breaking records, making it increasingly important to harness reliable cannabis supply chain technology. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tag/blockchain/">Blockchain</a> has vast potential, it offers a regulatory framework that is quick and efficient and plays an important role in cannabis supply chain management.</p>
      <p>Blockchain banking solutions are in high demand, and their capacity for better, greater inventory management and supply chain oversight will be a game-changer. It is roughly estimated that the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blockchain-technology-integration-in-the-cannabis-supply-chain-683935751.html">blockchain market in the supply chain</a> will reach $424.24 million by 2023 with a compound annual growth rate of 48.37 percent during the forecast period.</p>
      <p>However, as a direct response to technological evolution, there has been exponential growth in the volume of data flowing through devices. More data translates to data management problems – more intensive, bigger servers are now required to keep up with the sheer influx of data.</p>
      <p>A multichain oracle framework allows several blockchains to interact seamlessly with the platform. <a href="https://multichain.ventures/">Multichain Ventures</a> is an end to end blockchain solution provider for developers, merchants, and crypto companies.</p>
      <h3>What is Multichain Ventures?</h3>

      <p>The application includes a Tokes Wallet and a Tokes Merchant Gateway software that offers a point of sale application for the marijuana industry to accept Tokes, or tokenized assets and other cryptocurrencies in lieu of cash payments. Consumers are taken into the process by either loading their mobile wallet prior to visiting a seller or using in-store kiosks. This yields auditable, fast and inexpensive ways to conduct transactions that combat the cash handling liability of the merchant and provides a verifiable history of all the transactions on the blockchain.</p>
      <p><a href="https://tokesplatform.org/">Tokes.Platform</a> can help effortless management of regulation and monitor compliance in real-time.

      <p>There is a need for assured exchange of products and meticulous scrutiny of cannabis logistics while protecting the privacy and eliminating fraud. Since large sections of the cannabis market are still unregulated, one of the definitive supply chain solutions for cannabis firms would be a secure and fully integrated blockchain platform that will effectively register and track cannabis IP from genome to sale. Legally licensed cannabis growers and sellers will easily get their money’s worth.</p>
      <p>The integration of blockchain technology into cannabis supply chains will easily make information accessible and modifiable at any node. There are various factors that are driving the growth of blockchains- enhanced immutability and transparency, increasing security concerns and improving smart contracts. Being able to provide producers, purchasers, and consumers with lab-certified information will lead to the creation of a mutually beneficial ecosystem.</p>
