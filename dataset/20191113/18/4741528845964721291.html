      <p><b>Mr Fayolle</b> reportedly disclosed that the lending initiative would promote gender-related climate change investments and in reference to the European border engagement program, the EIB target is to improve support for higher female economic participation in Nigeria and other African countries.</p>
      <p><b>The European Investment Bank</b> is a subsidiary of the European Union which lends. The EIB has a history of supporting African countries with investment and has been doing so for over 50 years. In 2018, the EIB provided investment support to the tune of €3.3 billion, most of which went to the private sector.</p>
      <p><b>Recent event:</b> the EIB has reportedly agreed a partnership deal with a Guinea-based company for usage of cleaner power sources in its processes. Also, the EIB created a new lending initiative in partnership with a Malawian bank to finance entrepreneur across Malawi.</p>
      <p>“<i>The move to renewable sources of energy such as solar power will help the company reduce its carbon footprint. Habbal estimates that thousands of jobs will be created as a result of this deal,” Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Guinea-based firm, Mohamed Al Habbal, said.</i></p>
      <p><i>“The money will help the bank enhance its long-term credit to small businesses owned by women. The agreement comes with technical assistance which will help the bank enhance its trade financing,” </i>Senior Manager at Malawi’s FDH Bank, Patricia Hamisi, said.</p>
