      <h1>Jets CEO Christopher Johnson says Adam Gase to return as coach in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:11:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Cimini</a></address>
      <p>FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Despite a 2-7 record, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> CEO Christopher Johnson said Wednesday he will not make a coaching change, indicating the embattled Adam Gase will return in 2020.</p>
      <p>Johnson, in his first public remarks since June, said he informed the team last Wednesday that Gase isn't going anywhere.</p>
      <p>Johnson said the poor season is "exceedingly frustrating," but he commended Gase, in his first season, for keeping the team unified and fighting through a rash of injuries.</p>
      <p>Speaking at practice, Johnson expressed confidence in Gase and new general manager Joe Douglas, who was hired in June.</p>
      <p>Fan unrest peaked in the aftermath of an ugly loss to the previous winless <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> on Nov. 3. The Jets beat the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> last Sunday.</p>
