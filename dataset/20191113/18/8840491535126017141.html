      <p>Having previously packed out the esteemed Royal Albert Hall in London, tickets are selling fast so don’t delay.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Home Alone in Concert composer John Williams said: “Ever since Home Alone appeared, it has held a unique place in the affections of a very broad public.</p>
      <p>“Director Chris Columbus brought a uniquely fresh and innocent approach to this delightful story, and the film has deservedly become a perennial at Holiday time.</p>
      <p>“I took great pleasure in composing the score for the film, and I am especially delighted that the magnificent Orchestra of Ireland has agreed to perform the music in this very special live presentation of the movie.</p>
      <p>“I know I speak for everyone connected with the making of the film in saying that we are greatly honoured by this event… and I hope that the audience will experience the renewal of joy that the film brings with it, each and every year.”</p>
      <p>Macaulay Culkin stars as Kevin McCallister, an 8-year-old boy who iss accidentally left behind when his family leaves for Christmas vacation, and who must defend his home against two bungling thieves.</p>
      <p>Hilarious and heart-warming, Home Alone is holiday fun for the entire family and comes to Ireland for the first time this Christmas.</p>
