      <h1>Minnesota high school threw away hot lunches for students with over $15 of lunch debt</h1>

      <p>Instead of feeding high school kids who were too poor to pay their lunch bill, a high school in Minnesota humiliated the students in front of the other students by throwing their hot meals in the garbage and giving them cold food instead, reports <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minnesota-school-threw-out-hot-meals-students-over-15-lunch-n1081106">NBC News</a>. After the school was exposed, they decided an apology was in order.</p>
      <blockquote>"We deeply regret our actions today and the embarrassment that it caused several of our students," the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RPS280/posts/2493317357403020">district wrote in a statement</a> Monday. "We have met with some of the students involved and apologized to them."<br/><br/>Richfield Superintendent Steven Unowsky told KARE the actions of cafeteria staff were "inappropriate."<br/><br/>“There are multiple failures we had in this situation and our job is to fix it. First and foremost [in] the way we treated our kids. We should never leave kids with the feeling they had from the experience,” Unowsky said.</blockquote>
      <p>It seems like a decent apology. You can d<a href="https://www.richfieldschools.org/Page/3364">onate to the school district's meal account</a> here. It's kind of difficult to do, so follow the directions closely.</p>
