      <h2>Scotland introduced new legislation targeting psychological abusers in April this year.</h2>

      <p>Thirteen people have been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/justice">convicted</a> under new legislation which outlaws coercive control and psychological abuse, the First Minister has revealed.</p>
      <p>The Domestic Abuse Act came into force in April, making emotional and psychological abuse an offence for the first time.</p>
      <p>The legislation, brought in by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-government">Scottish Government</a> , targeted abusers who control their victims by isolating them from their friends and family, or restrict their finances.</p>
      <p>As well as the 13 convictions under the new legislation, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nicola-sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> said there are several other cases being prosecuted.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>She told Holyrood's committee conveners that while it is still "early days in the operation of the Act", there have "already" been 13 convictions under the new law and a "number proceeding through the courts at the moment".</p>
      <p>She said while the Act is important to address a "clear deficiency in the law", there is a "deeper and more fundamental job" to be done in raising awareness of emotional and psychological abuse.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said: "We still have the situation where the kinds of behaviour that are now rightly criminalised by this new Act are not always recognised by the victims, perhaps even the perpetrators - though I am less worried about that - and certainly by the courts and the system as the criminal offences that they are."</p>
      <p>An awareness raising campaign accompanied the introduction of the new legislation, but Sturgeon said there is "a lot of work still there to do".</p>
