      <h2>Michael Whinham, from Benwell, has been missing for four years and his dad Paul believes he is still alive</h2>

      <p>It has been four years since Newcastle man Michael Whinham went missing - but his dad says he will never stop looking for him.</p>
      <p>Michael, who had been living <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/benwell">in Oakfield Gardens, Benwell</a> , was reported missing to police in 2015.</p>
      <p>He vanished on November 14 that year and the last confirmed sighting of him was on CCTV footage which showed him leaving Newcastle Crown Court, on the Quayside.</p>
      <p>His dad Paul believes he is alive and has been trying to search for him ever since.</p>

      <p>He says Michael,  who would be 34 years old now and suffers from mental health difficulties, is likely to be sleeping rough elsewhere in the country.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, he was contacted by a number of people who said they saw his son in the Wolverhampton area.</p>
      <p>Those leads were followed up by police but Michael was not found.</p>
      <p>Paul, 69, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a>, said: "There were about 16 to 18 sightings of him in Wolverhampton, which I informed the police about. I'm certain the sightings were genuine.</p>
      <p>"I myself went down there in June to see if I could find him. I spoke to people there who recognised him straight away and said Michael had a beard and long hair when they saw him.</p>
      <p>"I met a security guard at an Asda store and he recognised Michael. He said 'I've never seen him for a few weeks'.</p>
      <p>"I also went to an old church that had been converted into a welfare centre and people there said they had seen Michael.</p>
      <p>"I'm 100% sure he is alive. I don't know if it's fatherly instinct, I just don't feel he has died. Apart from that, there is no evidence to show that he has died - no body has been found."</p>

      <p>Paul wants his son to get in touch with him so he can be given the help he needs.</p>
      <p>"If he's quite content living the way he is living, that's fine," said Paul. "I just want to know he is safe.</p>
      <p>"If he is reading this, I want to tell him not to worry. I want him to get in touch. He will not be in any trouble and will be able to get help.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't need to be homeless. There can be help for his mental health."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police</a> is asking anyone with information about Michael to contact them.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: "Since Michael’s disappearance, we have carried out widespread enquiries and appealed for information to help locate him.</p>
      <p>"Earlier this year, we were made aware of reports he might have been in the Wolverhampton area and carried out extensive enquiries with the help of West Midlands Police. However these attempts to locate Michael were unsuccessful. </p>
      <p>"Our investigation is still open and we would ask anybody who has any information to contact police on 101 quoting reference 0212670."</p>
