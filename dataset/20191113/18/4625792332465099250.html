      <h1>'Schiff can't do his own questions': Trump knocks Democrats for using lawyer during impeachment hearing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:11:33+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>President Trump commented on the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-impeachment-testimony-day-one">ongoing House impeachment hearing</a> while he answered reporters' questions sitting next to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.</p>
      <p>"[Adam] Schiff can't do his own questions," Trump said Wednesday, taking a dig at the House Intelligence chairman for using a lawyer to question witnesses. House Democrats have tapped Daniel Goldman to question witnesses. Republicans have their own lawyer, Steve Castor, who they can call upon to ask questions during their portion of the impeachment hearing.</p>

      <p>House Democrats have started the public part of the impeachment process Wednesday with their first public hearing. They plan on holding a series of hearings throughout the upcoming weeks with witnesses from the administration who have knowledge about Trump's alleged withholding of aid from Ukraine if it did not investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>The Turkish president was <a href="https://apnews.com/065db6b92e0846e2b6a6bc5c95b6146e?utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">meeting</a> with Trump and Republicans to discuss the country's decision to buy a Russian air defense system. They also plan to discuss Turkey's attack on U.S. allies, the Kurds.</p>
