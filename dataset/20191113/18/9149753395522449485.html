      <h1>This Acer Predator laptop with a GTX 1660 Ti is $1,200 right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:53:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The Acer Predator Helios 300 is one of the most popular <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">gaming laptops</a> around, though the hardware inside can vary from model to model. Laptop deals are heating up as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a> approaches, and now you can get one variant of the Helios 300 for $1,199.99, a $200 savings from the previous price.</p>
      <p>The model on sale (PH317-53-77HB) has a 9th-generation Intel Core i7-950H processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card with 6GB of VRAM, a 17.3-inch 1080p IPS display, 8GB of DDR4 2666MHz RAM, a 512GB PCIe NVME SSD, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Windows 10 Home is pre-installed.</p>
      <p>These specifications are fairly standard for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-laptop-deals/">a laptop in this price range</a>, though you do get a nice large 17-inch screen (sadly only 60Hz) and the classic Helios 300 design. The included GTX 1660 Ti graphics card should be plenty powerful for most games.</p>
