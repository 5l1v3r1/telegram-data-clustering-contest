      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> demonstrates how her new SKIMS body tapes work with a tutorial on social media on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Using a topless model, the Kardashian shows fans how to use her collection of nude-coloured body tapes for tricky outfits that boast plunging necklines and threaten to expose more than what you bargained for.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> alum, 39, also discusses her previous very painful experiments with other types of sticky tape including gaffer tape and industrial shipping tape.</p>
      <p>To avoid revisiting her famous gaffer tape bra from 2008, Kim has introduced a more comfortable version for her solution-focused shapewear brand.</p>

      <p>She announces: "Hey guys, I’m in my closet and I’m going to show you how to tape up your boobs with the boob tape because it’s something that I have used for so many years."</p>
      <p>But she admits: "I would use gaffers tape and shipping tape and it would burn me and rip me.</p>
      <p>"This material is super soft and super stretchy — but not too stretchy because you want it to hold. It’s like the perfect amount of stretch."</p>

      <p>Promising to create a "mini-boob lift", Kim reveals she wanted to share her "lifesaving secret" and made the tutorial to show how easy SKIMS tape are to use.</p>
      <p>The tape works as a DIY lift when women choose to go braless and want to create the ultimate hold on their cleavage.</p>
      <p>SKIMS tonal body tape has a slight stretch to it to allow ultimate hold underneath and comes in three shades of nude.</p>

      <p>In the social media video, Kim is filmed cutting the tape and peeling the back label off before sticking it onto the topless model.</p>
      <p>After securing the tape smoothly on the skin, the businesswoman dresses the model with a chic blazer to prove the invisible appearance on the tape that lies underneath.</p>
      <p>Afterwards Kim encourages the model pull the tape off of her body to show how easily it comes off, pain-free, and without leaving any marks on her skin.</p>

      <p>The global icon then shares a series of throwback images of when she used either duct tape or gaffer tape to strap her boobs down in some of her most memorable outfits.</p>
      <p>The snaps show Kim wearing fashion ensembles with very low necklines and plunging designs as she captions each with an explanation of her painful wardrobe hack.</p>
      <p>In one photo, Kim jokes she was in such a rush that her cleavage looked lopsided due to uneven tape application.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in another shot, she reveals she used black tape, but admits it flattened the center part of her boob.</p>
