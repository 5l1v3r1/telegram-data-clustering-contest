      <p>Apple today has released the second developer beta of macOS Catalina 10.15.2, following yesterday’s release of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/12/ios-13-3-beta-2/">second beta of iOS 13.3, tvOS 13.3 and watchOS 6.1.1</a>. Apple does not specify what’s new in the update, but it likely focuses on performance improvements, security updates, and bug fixes.</p>
      <p>Developers can update to the latest beta through System Preferences if they’re already enrolled in the Beta Program. A <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">public beta release</a> should be available later this week.</p>
