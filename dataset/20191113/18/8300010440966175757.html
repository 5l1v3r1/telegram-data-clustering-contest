      <p>You've heard of government cheese? This is definitely not that. <br/><br/>Each block of <a href="https://dibruno.com/https://www.philabundance.org/upcycle/">Abundantly Good Cheese</a> is handcrafted by Amish farmers in Lancaster County, PA. The farmers make the cheese for restaurants and high-end specialty markets like DiBruno Bros. And when they have surplus milk, they make that same cheese and give it to Philabundance, Philadelphia's largest hunger-relief agency, to give out to the needy.<br/><br/>It's a creative partnership that helps the farmers cut down on waste, saves the planet and feeds our neighbors in need.The cheese comes in a variety of flavors, upcycling milk that might otherwise go to waste and creating cheese that is Abundantly Good.</p>
