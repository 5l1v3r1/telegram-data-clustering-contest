      <p>US Senator Jim Risch, a Republican, called himself a "strong proponent" of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and urged its passage.</p>
      <p>The bill would re-examine Washington's special treatment of Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang attacked Risch, saying he had "turned a blind eye to the blatant beating, smashing and burning perpetrated by Hong Kong demonstrators".</p>
      <p>"I want to reiterate that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong. Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and cannot be interfered by any external forces," he said.</p>
      <p>The protests, now in its sixth month, escalated sharply after an officer shot a protester and a man was set on fire on Monday.</p>
      <p>For the third day in a row, protesters caused major train service disruptions, blocked streets and rallied in the central business district.</p>

      <p>Geng also criticised the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, a Uighur-rights organisation, which published hundreds of coordinates of suspected internment camps in China's far-western <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/xinjiang.html">Xinjiang</a> region.</p>
      <p>Geng called the group's allegations "groundless".</p>
      <p>"All lies will collapse when faced with facts," he added.</p>
      <p>Experts say China has held one million Muslim members of Xinjiang's Turkic <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/uighur.html">Uighur</a> ethnic minority and other groups inside mass detention facilities.</p>
      <p>Associated Press journalists have witnessed barbed wire, high walls and guard towers at some of the facilities, which Beijing calls vocational training centres.</p>
