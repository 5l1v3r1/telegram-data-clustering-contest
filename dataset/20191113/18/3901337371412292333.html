      <p>“We want to thank the clubs and coaches for releasing the players we have in camp. The good thing about the players here is that they did not have any major injuries,” Ntseki said.</p>
      <p>“It is a tough one playing Ghana away but I think if you look at the history of Bafana Bafana, we do very well when we play away. </p>
      <p>“It is a tough match and we are ready for it because we believe that we have the quality to do well. We called up 25 players and they are ready to play whenever they are given a chance, so yes we do have two matches but out concentration is overcoming the first hurdle, which is Ghana, when we are done with Ghana we will prepare tactically and mentally for Sudan,” he added.  </p>
