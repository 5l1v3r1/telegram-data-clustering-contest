      <h1>Fred explains how Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has finally got the best out of him for Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>The Brazilian midfielder had a tough start to life at Old Trafford but his performances have seen a huge improvement in recent weeks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:13:02+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Fred has praised manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for giving him the confidence to play his best football after a difficult start to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> career.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old signed from Shakhtar Donetsk for £52m in 2018, and much was expected of the central midfielder.</p>
      <p>He struggled to get in the first-team under Jose Mourinho, however, and only managed to make 17 Premier League appearances last season.</p>
      <p>During the current campaign he has been much-improved, and put in a brilliant performance during United's 3-1 win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1368577/2019/11/13/has-happy-and-confident-fred-finally-turned-a-corner-at-united/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> , Fred credited Solskjaer for his upturn in form.</p>
      <p>"The trust from the manager is important and I feel I have this," he said.</p>

      <p>"I just want to continue doing what I’m doing, playing well and starting the games — but I want to score, too. I came close (against Brighton) and hit the bar but I’ll keep working until this happens.</p>
      <p>"I’m very happy, firstly because we won but also because we’re getting some rhythm and we’re doing well in the cups.</p>
      <p>"But we needed to do better in the league. We just have to carry on fighting so that we reach the Champions League."</p>
      <p>Fred said he is the happiest he has been since moving to United from Ukraine, and thinks a run of consecutive games has helped him get into his rhythm.</p>

      <p>He added: "I’m feeling better than I’ve ever felt since moving to England. All I ever wanted was to play regularly and now that I’m doing that, there’s no doubt my confidence is higher and that helps any player."</p>
      <p>Fred will be looking to help United continue their recent fine form when they take on Sheffield United after the international break on November 24.</p>
