      <p><b>Hong Kong, China</b> - After a night of tear gas and bullets, demonstrators gathered at the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong waited in anticipation for a confrontation with police as a tense week of protests continued.</p>
      <p>After two days of fiery demonstrations at the prominent institution, anti-government protesters continued to occupy the Sha Tin-based campus late on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Until recently, protests largely remained off university properties, but that changed on Monday when violence engulfed the Chinese University's campus, morphing into a showdown between security forces and demonstrators. Police fired rubber-coated rounds and water cannon while protesters hurled petrol bombs and fired slingshots.</p>
      <p>Stephen Chan, a 20-year-old politics student, said Tuesday's battle was significant because he considers Chinese University a prestigious institution in the city, and it should be a safe space for young people in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/hong-kong.html">Hong Kong</a>.</p>
      <p>"It is the home of all students," Chan told Al Jazeera.</p>
      <p>At the campus on Wednesday, there were few signs protesters were planning to vacate any time soon.</p>
      <p>Volunteers shuttled in bags of supplies from Tai Po Road, including paper towels, cans of Red Bull, and soap. The items were stockpiled in various locations around campus, with a group of volunteers handing out provisions in front of Number-Two Bridge, which became one of the main sites of the previous night's standoff.</p>
      <p>Near the bridge, protesters sat on the curb next to a makeshift roadblock made from a burned-out car.</p>
      <p>Some were armed with javelins - more usually used on the athletics field - while others had bows and arrows. Petrol bombs were rolled underneath a white university vehicle in preparation for any police charge.</p>

      <h3>'Long-time fight'</h3>
      <p>Chung Yi Cheng, who has taught philosophy at Chinese University for 25 years, said the protests there marked a new stage in the uprising against China's influence over the semi-autonomous territory.</p>
      <p>"It seems they want to use the university campus as the venue for a long-time fight," he said of the occupiers.</p>
      <p>The events follow a particularly violent start to the week after police shot a 21-year-old protester on Monday. In a separate incident, a demonstrator set a pro-Beijing supporter on fire. A network of roadblocks were erected for a mass general strike as calls went out for students and other Hong Kong citizens to boycott classes and skip work.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Tuesday called protesters' actions "selfish" and condemned their attempts to bring the city to a halt. Hong Kong police said demonstrators threw objects onto Tolo highway, a major expressway in Hong Kong, and MTR tracks to block traffic.</p>
      <p>Chinese University issued a statement on Wednesday announcing it was ending the term early, citing the disruption to public transportation and damage to the campus.</p>
      <p>Several other universities, including Hong Kong Baptist University, announced they would conduct lectures and exams online for the next two weeks.</p>
      <h3>'Defensive and prepared'</h3>
      <p>While classes have stopped, the demonstration at the campus does not appear to be. Two Chinese University alumni sat on Wednesday in the stadium - now equipped with a makeshift catapult consisting of metal poles held together with zip ties and bolts.</p>
      <p>"We don't know when the police will come again so we have to be defensive and prepared," Jacky, 24, one of the former students, told Al Jazeera.</p>
      <p>"We are already graduated and we are trying to protect the students here," he said, noting the university's location was strategic for disrupting traffic.</p>

      <p>Others who came to join the protest from off-campus said they did so in solidarity as former Hong Kong students.</p>
      <p>Katniss, 23, arrived in the early hours of Wednesday after seeing messages on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/social-media.html">social media</a> from students asking for reinforcements. "We're just coming for support," she said.</p>
      <p>Spencer Ho, 39, who has volunteered as a medic at protests since late July, said this round of violence felt like something he hadn't experienced yet on the streets.</p>
      <p>"They are just students. It's different. It's different than the outside," he said.</p>
      <p>The escalation of this week's protests, including those at the Chinese University, catalysed school closures around the city. Hong Kong's Bureau of Education - which initially said school attendance was for parents to decide - announced classes for primary and secondary schools would be cancelled on Thursday for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's anti-government protests started in June in response to a proposed extradition bill to China. Peaceful protests later turned into a call for widespread government reform, including the right to directly elect Hong Kong officials and an independent investigation into alleged police brutality against demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Violence between protesters and police has increased in scope and intensity over the past six months.</p>

      <h3>What next?</h3>
      <p>How police will respond to the university's occupation remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Jacky So, president of Chinese University's student union, applied for an injunction on Wednesday to stop police from entering the campus. It was later denied by a Hong Kong court.</p>
      <p>Despite the heightened violence, one 21-year-old social work major - who asked to remain anonymous - said protesting at the campus provided a certain comfort level compared to street demonstrations. "It felt different because this is a school," she said.</p>
      <p>Camped out with a group of friends on the floor of the university's empty canteen, she said she sees the coming together of so many students as a breakthrough - but she has no idea how things will play out.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if we can win. I don't know the definition of winning. We are just trying our best to defend."</p>
