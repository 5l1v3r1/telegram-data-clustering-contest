      <h1>Disney+ Clears 10 Million Subscribers on Day One</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:12:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/charlotte-henry/" target="_blank">Charlotte Henry</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ surpassed 10 million subscribers on its first day, <i>The Verge </i>reported. The app has been downloaded over 3.2 million times, despite tech teething-problems.</p>
      <blockquote>The Mandalorian, the live-action Star Wars show easily considered the crown jewel of Disney’s streaming service, saw north of 2 million streams over the first day, according to people familiar with the matter. That number has more than likely grown due to overnight and second day viewing. By the end of the day, Disney+ was also the top app in the App Store, according to Apptopia. Launching with a bundle — ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu — also helped bump up both apps in app stores, according to Apptopia’s report. Sources familiar with the matter told The Verge that the bundle also saw a notable increase in sign-ups following the launch of Disney+. To put everything into additional context, analysts projected that Disney+ would have anywhere between 10-18 million subscribers in its first year. Disney has signed up more than half of those projected numbers in 24 hours.</blockquote>
