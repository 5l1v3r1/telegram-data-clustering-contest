      <h1>Trump Administration Proposes Tougher Rules on Work Permits for Asylum-Seekers</h1>

      <p>(WASHINGTON) — The Trump administration is proposing to make it tougher for asylum-seekers to obtain permission to work in the United States while their immigration cases are pending.</p>
      <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Wednesday that a proposed rule would double the time asylum-seekers must wait for a work permit to a year and bar those who crossed a border illegally from applying for the permits at all.</p>
      <p>The agency says the rule aims to discourage immigrants who don’t qualify for asylum from seeking it.</p>
      <p>The public can comment on the proposed rule until Jan. 13.</p>
      <p>It is the latest in a series of proposals by the Trump administration aimed at deterring immigrants from seeking asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
