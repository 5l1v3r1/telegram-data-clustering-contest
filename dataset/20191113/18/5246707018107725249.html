      <p>With all the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/pokemon_fans_get_gamefreaklied_trending_as_sword_and_shield_drama_intensifies_yet_again">Poké-drama</a> doing the rounds today, we thought it might be a good idea to just sit back and chat about something a little bit silly. How about headless <b>Fire Emblem</b> characters?</p>
      <p>Yes, we're all familiar and in love with <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses"><b>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</b></a> at this point, with its lovely cast of characters and their intriguing, intricate storylines, but how would we feel about them if they wandered around without a head? We're sure you've been thinking about this just as much as we have, which is why we're all pretty lucky to have stumbled across this tweet.</p>

      <p>Yep, Fire Emblem modder @Ajw311 has removed the head model of his player character, leaving them to aimlessly run around looking like some strange 'artsy' vase or something that us simple folk would never be able to truly appreciate. Thinking about it, it's not too dissimilar from the sort of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/10/random_odd_fifa_18_glitch_leaves_players_with_no_face_on_nintendo_switch">glitches you often see in FIFA</a>.</p>
      <p>Let's be thankful, then, that this sort of nightmare fuel can't be seen within the game by normal means.</p>

        <i>OK, as you were...</i>
