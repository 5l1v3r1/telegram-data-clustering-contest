      <h1>Nolte: Never Trumper Arnold Schwarzenegger Is Box Office Poison</h1>
      <h2>Christian Toto, over at his <a href="https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/">Hollywood in Toto</a> site, was <a href="https://www.hollywoodintoto.com/schwarzenegger-box-office-poison/">the first</a> to declare Schwarzenegger “box office poison,” and he lays out the reasons why (RINO, Global Warming, etc). Since I can’t improve on that, I wanted to focus on the math and show my work.</h2>

      <p>Between 1982, straight through to 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the king of the box office, the $20 million man, an unstoppable force and star who could open a movie on his name only. Granted, his star had waned a bit near the end, but his final round of films before becoming one of California’s worst governors, were hit and miss.</p>
      <p>Not counting for 15 years of inflation, <i>Terminator 3</i> (2003)  grossed $150 million domestic ($283M overseas).</p>
      <p><i>End of Days</i> (1999) earned a respectable $66  million domestic ($145M overseas), while <i>The 6th Day</i> (2000) and <i>Collateral Damage</i> (2002) sputtered out at $35 and $42 million, respectively.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Schwarzenegger was still a big and bankable enough star that studios were willing to gamble huge budgets based only on his presence.</p>
      <p>If Schwarzenegger thought he could ride out of the governorship and back into box office glory, that idea was quickly put down by four screaming flops in a row.</p>
      <p><i>Last Stand</i> (2013) died a twitching death with just $12 million domestic ($36M overseas).</p>
      <p>Teaming up with fellow 80’s superstar Sylvester Stallone (who  is still bankable in hits like <i>Creed</i>) for <i>Escape Plan</i> (2013) failed to lift that prison break thriller above $25 million ($112M overseas).</p>
      <p>Something called <i>Sabotage</i> (2014) grossed just $10 million ($7M overseas), and Schwarzenegger’s leap into the popular zombie genre with <i>Maggie</i> (2015) was a full-blown catastrophe grossing just $187,000 ($1.5M overseas). Public indifference ensured it never saw a release in more than 17 theaters.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Arnold probably looks back at the years 2013 through 2015 as the good old days. After all, with $89 million domestic and $351 million overseas, at least his attempt to reboot his most famous franchise with <i>Terminator: Genisys</i> (2015) wasn’t a complete catastrophe. Oh, it lost money and under-performed bigly, so much so a planned trilogy was scrapped, but there was at least a spark of interest there.</p>
      <p>Now let’s look at Arnold’s box office performance since President Trump’s 2016 election and Schwarzenegger’s embarrassing decision to become a girly-man Never Trumper.</p>
      <p>A movie called <i>Aftermath</i> (2017) went straight to video.</p>
      <p>A movie called Killing Gunther (2017) went straight to video.</p>
      <p>Just stop and think about that… An Arnold Schwarzenegger movie went <i>straight to video.</i></p>
      <p>And then, all on his own, also in 2017, Schwarzenegger murdered NBC’s 14-year-old blockbuster <i>Celebrity Apprentice</i> franchise. This was a humiliation that deserved more attention at the time.</p>
      <p>Schwarzenegger took over hosting duties from Trump, who turned the show into a mega-hit over 14 seasons. What’s more, during Trump’s 14th and final season, he attracted a viewership that ranged from 7.6 to 6.1 million viewers, which was an <i>increase</i> over the previous season. And then Schwarzenegger stumbled in, drove the ratings into the dirt with 4.8 to 3.5 measly viewers, and cancellation.</p>
      <p>But Arnie always has <i>Terminator,</i> right? He can always go back to his classic franchise, right?</p>
      <p>Not anymore.</p>
      <p>Even with the return of co-star Linda Hamilton and producer/creator James Cameron, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>opened two weeks ago and crashed upon take-off with a catastrophic $29 million opening. Over the last 11 days, <i>Dark Fate</i> still hasn’t crossed $50 million domestic and $200 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>Arnold’s final grip on box office glory, his Terminator franchise and this $250 million (production plus promotion) boondoggle, is not only a box office humiliation, it killed a 35-year-old franchise.</p>
      <p>Schwarzenegger still has a sequel to <i>Twins </i>in the works, a sequel to <i>Conan</i>, but let’s see how far those go now with the failure of <i>Dark Fate</i>.</p>
      <p>I mean, if Arnold can’t even open a <i>Terminator</i> movie…<b><i> </i></b></p>
