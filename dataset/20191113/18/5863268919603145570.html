      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) - Three-day long tour match between Pakistanis and Australia A has been drawn with former team leading with 368 runs.</p>
      <p>Pakistan put up a brilliant display with their bowling and troubled the Kangaroos on their own turf. 16-year-old medium-pacer, Naseem Shah, turned out to be extraordinary question for the Australians.</p>

      <p>Pakistan’s 16-year-old quick Naseem Shah has given Australia’s batsmen plenty to think about with a fiery spell in the drawn pink-ball tour match against Australia A.</p>
      <p>Two days after the death of his mother, Naseem delivered a bruising display of fast bowling at Perth Stadium that culminated in the teenager dismissing Marcus Harris (20) with a fearsome bouncer that caught the left-hander’s edge.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Boasting an unusual technique and impressive pace, the right-arm quick finished with figures of 1-21 before Australia A captain Alex Carey and Pakistan counterpart Azhar Ali shook hands with half an hour left on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>Australia A were 2-91 in their second innings at the conclusion of the three-day match, still 367 runs shy of Pakistan’s tally after a dominant display by the tourists.</p>
      <p>Usman Khawaja survived to be 37 not out, although it was likely to be of little consequence ahead of Thursday’s Test squad announcement.</p>
      <p>Left-arm paceman Shaheen Afridi earlier had Test hopeful Joe Burns caught behind on 11, two balls after he was dropped at first slip.</p>
      <p>It was another untimely failure for Burns, who was clean-bowled by Imran Khan for a golden duck in the first innings as Australia A crumbled to be all out for 122.</p>
      <p>Pakistan declared their second innings at 3-152 after tea, having overall handled the conditions far better than the hosts.</p>

        <b>Day 2</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Australia A side has been bowled out for 122 in a calamitous tour match performance against Pakistan in Perth, where Pakistanis are leading with a 313-runs lead at the end of day two.</p>
      <p>The forgotten man Cameron Bancroft has provided a timely reminder of his staying powers. However, Joe Burns was clean-bowled for a golden duck and fellow Test hopefuls Marcus Harris, Usman Khawaja, Travis Head and Will Pucovski also fell cheaply as the hosts crumbled on day two of the pink-ball clash at Perth Stadium.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan proved most fruitful for Pakistanis as he bagged five for just 32 runs against Australia XI, while Shaheen Afridi and Iftikhar Ahmed both claimed two wickets each, and Yasir Shah took one wicket.</p>
      <p>Pakistanis were seven for no wicket at stumps, leading by 313 runs in the three-day match.</p>
      <p>Australia A were reeling at 9-57 in reply to Pakistan’s 428 before Bancroft (49) and Riley Meredith (19no) restored some pride, batting longer for the 10th wicket than the first nine combined.</p>
      <p>The resistance came to an end when left-arm quick Shaheen Afridi found Bancroft’s edge shortly before stumps.</p>
      <p>Pakistanis had started the day two on 336 runs for the loss of three wickets as Babar Azam (157 off 197) and Asad Shafiq (119 off 245) were retired out. The pair had piled on a colossal 276-run partnership. Yasir Shah scored a fifty as well (53 off 70).</p>
      <p>Australia A were in trouble from the very beginning as the hosts lost their first wicket without scoring any run. Cameron Bancroft remained unbeaten on 23 at dinner along with Riley Meredith (3).</p>
      <p>Marcus Harris scored 16 runs off 22 balls while Travis Head registered 13 off 18. No other batsman could enter the double figures.</p>
      <p>Pakistan’s Imran Khan dismissed five batsmen while Iftikhar Ahmed picked up two wickets. Shaheen Afridi sent one batsman to the pavilion.</p>

        <b>Day 1</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Pakistanis scored 336 runs for the loss of three wickets against Australia A in a tour match after winning the toss and deciding to bat first on Monday.</p>
      <p>Australia A started off well taking three wickets of Pakistan at just 60 runs. Babar Azam and Asad Shafiq piled on a colossal 276-run partnership for the rest of day 1. Azam scored 157 not out off 197 balls including 24 fours whereas Shafiq scored 119 not out off 245 balls hitting 12 fours and a six.</p>
      <p>Babar Azam has reinforced his standing as Pakistan s talisman, scoring a commanding unbeaten century in the pink-ball tour match against Australia A in Perth.</p>
      <p>Test stalwart Asad Shafiq also reached triple figures before Pakistan went to stumps at 3-336 on day one of the three-day clash.</p>
      <p>The visitors lost their first wicket on 13 when skipper Azhar Ali was removed after scoring 11 runs. Haris Sohail was the second batsman to be dismissed on 18 followed by opener Shan Masood (22). Test prospect Riley Meredith snared two early wickets while Micheal Neser took only one wicket throughout the day.</p>
      <p>"He’s an exceptionally good player," Australia Test hopeful Travis Head said about Babar. "He’s obviously translated that (white-ball) form nicely today.</p>
