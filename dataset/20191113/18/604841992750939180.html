      <p>Last week, Ryan Tubridy was at the receiving end of a barrage of calls and texts when he mentioned on radio that Dunboyne was in County Dublin, when talking about the Sean Cox 'You'll Never Walk Alone' CD.</p>
      <p>Now, the Department of Rural and Community Development, Tidy Towns, and SuperValu have made the same mistake. Dunboyne Tidy Towns has posted a photo of a poster on a local bus stop - congratulating Dunboyne Tidy Towns in Co Dublin.</p>
      <p>Is it any wonder we can't even win a Leinster title - next thing they'll be taking our players!</p>
