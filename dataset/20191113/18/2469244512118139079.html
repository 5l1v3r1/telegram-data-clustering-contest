      <p>A burglar has been jailed after he was caught inside the bungalows of two pensioners in a seaside town during the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>Matthew Jackman came face to face with an 89-year-old grandmother and an 80-year-old man after breaking into their homes in Seaton, East Devon, on the same night in September.</p>
      <p>He is a serial burglar with a history of targeting elderly victims, who used a coal bin and a water butt to reach windows which he tried to climb into open windows.</p>
      <p>He had the effrontery to advise one of the victims to lock her doors after she found him inside her home. In the other raid, he pretended he was looking for a woman called Emma after coming face to face with the pensioner.</p>
      <p>His excuse did not fool the householder who chased him down the road and tried to recover a cash tin which Jackman had snatched from a windowsill. He refused to hand it over but gave him £2 and begged him not to call the police.</p>
      <p>Jackman was identified by DNA from the burglaries. He has an appalling criminal record of 139 offences including 20 previous dwelling house break-ins.</p>
      <p>He had been out of prison for only a few weeks after being released half way through a four year, six months sentence for a burglary in Exeter where he was caught because he left his false teeth at the scene.</p>

      <p>Jackman, aged 57, of no fixed address, admitted two burglaries and was jailed for four years and eight months by Judge Peter Johnson at Exeter Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He told him:"You have many convictions for dwelling house burglaries and were last sentenced in July 2017. You had been released on licence when you committed these burglaries in Seaton.</p>
      <p>"They were at night, when you were heavily in drink, and on each occasion the occupier has been confronted by you."</p>
      <p>Mr Robert Yates, prosecuting, said the first offence happened at around 11 pm on September 14 when the 89-year-old woman heard someone in her bungalow in Townsend Road.</p>
      <p>She thought it may be her grandson visiting her but instead found Jackman who told her 'Sorry, I'll come back tomorrow. Make sure you lock your doors."</p>
      <p>He struck again 45 minutes later at a bungalow about 100 metres away at Newlands Park, where the 80-year-old was in bed.</p>
      <p>He heard a house outside and noticed a moneybox containing £14 was missing from his window ledge and that a water butt had been moved to under the window.</p>
      <p>There was a ring on his door and he saw Jackman, who said he was 'looking for Emma'. The owner spotted the cash box and chased him, at which point Jackman handed back £2 of his money and pleaded with him not to call the police.</p>
      <p>He was tracked down and linked to the break ins by DNA. He told police he had drunk a bottle of gin and a bottle of wine on the night and he had little memory of what he had done.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee Bremridge, defending, said Jackman is a different person when he is not drinking or taking drugs and is now studying creative writing and has started to write a book.</p>
      <p>He said:"On this occasion, he had lost his accommodation and was drinking, that is when he got things wrong. When things go right, he is a very different character."</p>
