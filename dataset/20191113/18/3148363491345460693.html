      <p>The House Intelligence Committee reportedly scheduled two more closed-door depositions featuring an official working at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, David Holmes, and Office of Management and Budget official Mark Sandy, Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-impeachment-david-holmes-mark-sandy-67051991-a73a-4bd1-aa45-e02566ff35c6.html">reports</a>:</p>

      <p>According to reports, Holmes, who “worked at the embassy under former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch” and currently works for acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, is scheduled to appear on Friday, November 15 at 3:00 p.m:</p>

      <p>Axios adds:</p>
      <blockquote>Sandy, the director of national security programs at OMB, was initially scheduled to appear before the committees on Friday, Nov. 8; however, he was a no-show. He is now listed as appearing on Saturday, Nov. 16 at 10 a.m. It was not immediately clear as of Wednesday morning why Sandy was put back on the schedule. Worth noting: It isn’t clear whether Holmes and Sandy have agreed to testify before the committees. The schedule solely reflects that House investigators have requested their appearance.</blockquote>
      <p>The scheduled closed-door depositions reflect a concern made by Republicans at the time of the debate about the partisan impeachment resolution, which gives Schiff unprecedented power and operates under the guise of transparency. The resolution essentially states that the Intelligence Committee should conduct “an open hearing or hearings,” which House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) could technically <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/31/more-secret-hearings-scheduled-after-house-impeachment-inquiry-vote/">fulfill</a> by holding a single public hearing:</p>
