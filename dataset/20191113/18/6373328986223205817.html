      </p>
      <blockquote>Nickelodeon has generated scores of characters that kids love, and we look forward to telling wholly original stories that re-imagine and expand on the worlds they inhabit.<br/><br/>We’re thrilled to continue collaborating with Brian Robbins, Ramsey Naito, and the creative team at Nickelodeon in new ways as we look to find fresh voices and bring bold stories to our global audience on Netflix.</blockquote>

      <p>Netflix says 60% of its subscribers regularly watch kids shows and movies, suggesting the new content will be welcomed by the majority of viewers. Conversely, other kids’ cable networks might be less impressed with the news, as the number of people watching regular television is sinking thanks to direct-to-consumer platforms, like Netflix, picking off their viewers.</p>

        <b>Brian Robbins, president of Nickelodeon, spoke about the future of network, saying:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Nickelodeon’s next step forward is to keep expanding beyond linear platforms, and our broader content partnership with Netflix is a key path toward that goal.</blockquote>
