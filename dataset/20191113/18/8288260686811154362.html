      <p>Mac Demarco is set to appear in Birmingham on his latest tour later this month.</p>
      <p>The hugely talented musician will bring his band to the UK and Europe in November with five shows across Britain.</p>

      <p>The UK leg of the tour will also call at Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Mac has announced Orville Peck, the leather-fringe-masked rising country star as the special guest for London's Alexandra Palace, and today announces support for the rest of the UK and European run, courtesy of the Cumbia-infused instrumental act, Los Bitchos.</p>
