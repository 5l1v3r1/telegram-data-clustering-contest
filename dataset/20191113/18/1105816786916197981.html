      <p>Carrying a large backpack and wearing a heavy knit watch cap, the 16-year-old and her father Svante boarded “La Vagabonde,” a 14-metre catamaran belonging to an Australian couple that will be her home for the next two to three weeks.</p>

      <p>During her trip Greta excoriated world leaders at the United Nations, met former US president Barack Obama, received the keys to the city of Montreal and road tripped across the continent in a Tesla electric car lent to her by actor and ex-governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>

      <p>In a parting shot, the young activist said US President Donald Trump was “so extreme” a climate skeptic he unintentionally may be waking people up to the dangers facing the globe.</p>
      <p>“I thought when he got elected, now people will finally, now people must finally wake up,” she said in an interview on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Six people will be aboard “La Vagabonde” for the trip: Elayna Carausu, 26, and her partner Riley Whitelum, 35, together with their 11-month-old boy Lenny; 26-year-old professional British sailor Nikki Henderson, Greta, and her father Svante.</p>

      <p>Carausu and Whitelum stepped forward when Greta put out an appeal on November 1 for someone who could get her back to Europe.</p>
      <p>“We were kind of the only boat around the area that was willing to cross the Atlantic this time of year,” said Carausu.</p>
      <p>The seas are expected to be rougher on her return journey, given the season, but Greta says the prospect of harsh weather doesn’t perturb her.</p>

      <p>“She’s a very brave, independent, strong young lady. It’s inspiring and I’m honestly amazed at what she’s doing,” Carausu said.</p>
      <p>She added that the crew has “decided to have a vegan boat for Greta, mostly.”</p>

      <p>“But also in a sense we have gone a few more months without real action being taken and without people realising the emergency we are in.”</p>
      <p>As for 2020, “I don’t have any plans right now,” she says. Her school year starts in August.</p>
