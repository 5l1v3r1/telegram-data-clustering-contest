      <p>According to the press service, the activities of the SESC are aimed at working with schoolchildren who have shown outstanding learning abilities. The network of SESC in the Russian Federation exists for more than 55 years, in particular they exist in the Moscow and Novosibirsk state universities.

Representatives of the Russian Technological Agency and seven universities of the Russian Federation discussed the prospects of the project at TSU.</p>
      <blockquote>"We are among those universities that are now preparing applications for participation in the competition to create the SESC... Our SESC will work in partnership with other educational institutions in the region. That is, it will be a network organization", – Elena Sukhanova, Deputy Vice-Rector for Academic Work, Director of the Scientific and Educational Center "Institute for Innovations in Education" is quoted.</blockquote>
      <p>It is noted that one of the peculiarities of such a center in TSU will be its interaction with strategic academic units of the university. These are structures that conduct research work and that will identify future workers from the school bench.</p>
