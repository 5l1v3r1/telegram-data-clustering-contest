      <h1>Apple's Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR will be available in December</h1>
      <h2>Pricing starts at $5,999 and $4,999, respectively</h2>

      <h4>Facepalm: Inexplicably, Apple doesn’t ship its Pro Display XDR monitor with its matching Pro Stand, or any stand at all, for that matter. That “optional” accessory will set you back another $999. Yes, that’s right, a grand for a monitor stand. Predictably, this drew quite the reaction from the WWDC crowd when it was announced on stage.</h4>
      <p>Apple on Wednesday announced that its new Mac Pro and Apple Pro Display XDR will be available in December.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/80354-apple-unveils-2019-mac-pro-5999-workstation-powered.html">Revealed</a> in June at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference, the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> represents the first major redesign of Apple’s high-end desktop since 2013. The Mac Pro starts at $5,999 which gets you an octa-core Intel Xeon W processor clocked at 3.5GHz, Radeon Pro 580X graphics, 32GB of RAM and a 256GB solid state drive.</p>
      <p>The 32-inch <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">Pro Display XDR</a> (short for Extreme Dynamic Range), meanwhile, starts at $4,999 and features a Retina 6K display boasting a resolution of 6,016 x 3,384 (218 pixels per inch). A version with nano-texture glass commands an additional $1,000.</p>

      <p>The VESA mount adapter goes for $199.</p>
      <p>Apple only said its new products will be available in December. Specific pre-order dates and shipping windows weren’t mentioned although one has to hope that they’ll both be ready to go in time for the holidays.</p>
