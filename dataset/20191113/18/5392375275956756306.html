      <p>All those who do financial transactions using the fingerprint authentication on their phones should know it’s not the most secure way to protect their data. At least, it wasn’t the safest method for the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series handsets. But seems it’s not a problem anymore.</p>
      <h3>What Happened To Samsung Galaxy S10/Note 10 In Real?</h3>
      <p>If you remember, just recently, some users said their Samsung Galaxy S10 and Note 10 handsets have a fingerprint identification issue. Particularly, the ‘Sun’ reported that after a British couple installed a third-party silicone shell on their devices, anyone’s fingerprint could unlock their phones.</p>
      <p>Agree, this is a huge security breach, especially for financial transactions. That time, Samsung immediately responded to this and advised users to desist from non-Samsung glass screen protectors while it works on an update to solve the issue.</p>
      <p>A week ago, Samsung launched an urgent update to fix the bug related to the fingerprint identification security issue. The <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/24/samsung-fixes-fingerprint-vulnerability-of-galaxy-s10-and-note-10-via-update/">update</a> was pushed to the Galaxy S10 series and Note10 series phones.</p>
      <p>As for today, some ITHome users sent out screenshots showing the Samsung Galaxy S10/Note10 series has resumed Alipay fingerprint payment function. However, the WeChat fingerprint payment has not resumed yet.</p>

      <p>However, banks across the globe are not <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/22/banks-disable-app-fingerprint-login-option-for-samsung-galaxy-s10/">taking any chances</a>. Some financial institutions in China, Israel, and the UK have taken significant measures. The British bank, NatWest, and the Chinese bank, Bank of China, completely disabled their apps from Samsung Galaxy S10 users until Samsung solves the security problem. At the moment, there is still no information on whether the access has been resumed. In addition, another British financial institution, Nationwide Building Society, has a more gentle approach, and they decided to remove the option to fingerprint login from the app. In addition, Israeli netizens said that their bank also removed the option to fingerprint login from the app.</p>
