      </p>
      <p>The highly-anticipated launch of Disney Plus was beset by technical problems yesterday, as users complained of issues logging in or streaming shows.</p>
      <p>But the glitches, which Disney blamed on exceptionally high demand, appear to have had little impact on its sign-up figures. However, the firm has offered a free seven-day trial, meaning it is unlikely that all of the initial 10m subscribers will pay up.</p>
      <p>The strong start boosted Disney’s shares more than three per cent, while rival Netflix suffered a 1.5 per cent decline in its share price.</p>
      <p>The new, family-orientated streaming service is priced at $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, undercutting Netflix.</p>
      <p>Disney Plus will be rolled out in different countries over the coming months, and will hit UK screens on 31 March.</p>
