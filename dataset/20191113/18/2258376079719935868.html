      <p>SASKATOON -- The discovery of an dead infant in a Saskatoon recycling bin has prompted a non-profit agency to move ahead with its plan for a safe place for women to anonymously give up a newborn.</p>
      <p>Katelyn Roberts is executive director of Sanctum Care Group, which operates a home for pregnant women who are HIV positive or at-risk of having their baby apprehended because of addictions or homelessness.</p>
      <p>She says the agency announced plans in September to offer a private space at the home where women could leave an infant without having to provide identification.</p>
      <p>Roberts says Saskatchewan's Ministry of Social Services didn't support the initiative and requested that it be put on hold to study whether the service was needed.</p>
      <p>She says Sanctum Care is still waiting for a decision, but in light of last week's discovery, feels it's time to move ahead on its own.</p>
      <p>Police have said they believe the infant was a newborn, and investigators are looking for the mother who they say may be physically and emotionally vulnerable.</p>
      <p>"We do know that mothers in distress sometimes unsafely abandon their children because they don't feel that have any other option," Roberts said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Because there currently is no way in our city to safely and anonymously relinquish care of your child, we felt it necessary to fill that gap."</p>
      <p>Roberts said Sanctum Care is working hard to get the service available by next year.</p>
