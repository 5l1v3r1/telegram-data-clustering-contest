      <p>SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s antitrust regulator said on Wednesday it will reassess Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) $71 billion purchase of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) because the divestiture requested by the regulator as a condition for the merger of U.S. media companies has not happened yet.</p>
      <p>“The deal approved in February was contingent on the sale of the Fox Sports channel. As the sale was not finalized, the case will be re-examined,” the regulator known as ‘Cade’ said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The regulator said it requested the sale of Fox Sports to maintain the same level of competition in the Brazilian market after the deal, with three different sports options: SporTV, ESPN and the service provided by a new company with the Fox assets.</p>
      <p>The companies “tried” to comply with the request, but had not succeeded, the regulator said.</p>
      <p>Cade head Alexandre Barreto said the reassessment will consider “other options,” without giving details.</p>
      <p>The original decision in Brazil was similar to one by the Mexican telecoms regulator IFT, which also requested in March the sale of Fox sports channels in the country.</p>
