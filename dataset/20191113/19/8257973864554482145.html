      <h1>Democrats say House will vote next week to avert government shutdown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:09:46+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:09</time> by <a rel="author">Ed Adamczyk &amp; Danielle Haynes</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 13 (UPI) -- The House plans to vote next week on a resolution to keep the federal government funded for the next six weeks, House Democratic leader Rep. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Steny_Hoyer/?tps=1">Steny Hoyer</a> said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Hoyer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/house-will-vote-to-prevent-a-government-shutdown-for-another-month.html">said he expects</a> a "relatively clean" bill, indicating it might not contain language or provisions that have made previous spending measures difficult to pass in Congress.</p>
      <p>Senate Republicans, however, have not said whether they will pass the resolution.</p>
      <p>White House Director of legislative affairs Eric Ueland <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/470306-white-house-prepared-to-support-december-cr">told reporters</a> President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> is willing to support the short-term spending measure if it doesn't block "any ability of the president's to pursue his policies."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/shutdown-deadline-looming-budget-vote-expected/index.html">bill would prevent</a> a lapse in funding after Nov. 21 and extend the deadline for a new spending package to Dec. 20. The resolution would also allow the House and Senate to keep negotiating a longer-term budget bill.</p>
      <p>Although Congress has already approved much of a two-year budget deal, details including border security and defense funding remain unresolved. Funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border led to a 35-day shutdown earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The proposed extension was announced Wednesday by House appropriations committee Chairwoman Rep. Nita Lowry, D-N.Y., after she met with Sen. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Richard_Shelby/?tps=1">Richard Shelby</a>, R-Ala., her Senate counterpart.</p>
      <p>"In a rational world, this would be relatively easy to get accomplished," said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., chairman of the House budget committee. "But with this president, there's no way to predict what he's going to do."</p>
      <p>House Speaker <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Nancy_Pelosi/?tps=1">Nancy Pelosi</a> and Senate Republican leader Sen. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mitch_McConnell/?tps=1">Mitch McConnell</a> have said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/congress-aims-to-fund-government-through-dec-20-000326">they will not allow</a> government funding to lapse.</p>
