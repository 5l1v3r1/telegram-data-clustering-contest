      <p>The skulking, angsty pop song, which carries a message of unity and empowerment in the face of poor mental health, comes with a dystopian video that sees a resistant youth stand up to oppressive forces.</p>

      <p>Actress Joey King from Hulu’s true crime series <i>The Act </i>plays a rebel at the heart of the revolt, with Yungblud, Marshmello and Blackbear portraying themselves as members of the resistance.</p>

      <p>The clip, according to Yungblud in a press release, is a “call out to take mental health seriously.” It was shot in Bulgaria and directed by Andrew Sandler, who previously worked on the singer’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yungblud-announces-new-ep-unveils-stirring-video-hope-underrated-youth-2551030">Hope For The Underrated Youth’ visual</a>, the lead single from his latest EP of the same name.</p>
      <p>In October, the British star returned with a new EP, ‘The Underrated Youth’. The six-track record is “sharply written and filled with bold, unapologetic political statements”, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/yungblud-underrated-youth-ep-review"><i>NME’</i>s Hannah Mylrea wrote in a four-star review</a>.</p>
