      <h1>Report: Trade Talks Stall as China Renegs on Farm Purchase Promises | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>The talks aimed at reaching a ‘phase one’ trade deal between the U.S. and China have hit a “snag” over Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.</h2>

      <p>President Donald Trump has said China already agreed to buy up to $50 billion in farm products from the U.S. as part of the phase one trade deal. But China is hesitant to commit to a specific amount and wants any agreement on purchases to be contingent on on-going progress of trade talks, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-trade-talks-hit-snag-over-farm-purchases-11573671418?mod=hp_lead_pos2">reported</a>, citing unnamed sources familiar with the talks.</p>
      <p>“We can always stop the purchases if things get worse again,” the <i>Journal</i> quotes one Chinese official as saying.</p>
      <p>Beijing wants to avoid appearing to accept a deal that looks like too much of a win for the U.S., according to the report.</p>
      <p>China has also resisted making firm commitments over protection for American intellectual and the end of forced technology transfers. In addition, it is demanding the roll-back of existing U.S. tariffs as part of any phase one deal.</p>
      <p>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has fought back against lifting any of the existing tariffs without firmer commitments from China.</p>
