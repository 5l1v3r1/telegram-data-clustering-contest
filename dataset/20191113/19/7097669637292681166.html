      <p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican national oil company Pemex will not pay a ransom demanded by suspected cyberattackers who targeted the firm's computer systems, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Nahle, who also serves as chair of the Pemex board, added that the attack hit the company's administrative headquarters in Mexico City and that its "plants and wells" continued to operate.</p>
      <p>Hackers have demanded some $5 million in bitcoin from Pemex.</p>
      <p>The hack was first detected on Sunday, forcing the company to shut down computers across Mexico and freezing systems such as payments, according to employees and internal emails.</p>
