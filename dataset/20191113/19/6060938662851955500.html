      <p>NEW DELHI: A day after complaining that its India operations are on the brink of collapse over high taxes and spectrum dues demand, British telecom major Vodafone’s Global CEO <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nick-Read">Nick Read</a> did a u-turn on Wednesday, claiming he was quoted out of context and re-affirmed the company’s commitment to the market.</p>
      <p>Read, who on Tuesday was quoted by the media (while speaking in London) as complaining about “unsupportive regulation, (and) excessive taxes” in India, wrote a letter to PM <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi">Narendra Modi</a> and telecom minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravi-shankar-prasad">Ravi Shankar Prasad</a> on Wednesday, where he “apologised for the impressions that the press coverage conveys” and about certain quotes “which I never said”, according to official sources.</p>
      <p>“I wish to put on record that this does not accurately reflect my comments to the media. Furthermore, we did not speak to any Indian media yesterday, neither did any of my team,” Read said, as he claimed that “some of the coverage has been distorted.” A top-level source said the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vodafone-CEO">Vodafone CEO</a> expressed regret after the government took note of the comments and objected to the statement where Indian regulatory action, or taxation rates, were blamed for the company’s poor performance.</p>
      <p>“The government at the highest level, expressed displeasure and disapproval at the tone and tenor of Read’s statement. It was made clear to the company that the behaviour will not be appreciated,” the source said.</p>

      <p>It is believed that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kumar-Mangalam-Birla">Kumar Mangalam Birla</a>, the chairman of Vodafone-Idea (JV between Vodafone and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aditya-Birla-group">Aditya Birla group</a>), also expressed regret on the statement and reiterated the company’s commitment to maintain business operations in the country.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Vodafone-Idea did not offer comment when asked about the latest communication from the company. However, sources close to the company confirmed that a letter had been sent, addressed to the PM. In his letter, Read said that he had apprised the British media that the operations in India had reached a “critical phase” in view of the financial conditions that telecom companies are facing. “I talked about the financial stress in the industry.”</p>
      <p>However, the Vodafone boss also thanked the government over its recent initiatives to tackle the telecom sector challenges, especially on the formation of the Committee of Secretaries (CoS) to look into what he termed as “potential remedies”. “I look forward to continue to engage with the Indian government… (and) you have my word that Vodafone wishes to continue its long history in India given the right conditions. We strongly believe in the potential of the country, its telecom sector, and the transformative potential for its citizens which is closely aligned with your Digital India vision.”</p>
      <p>Read further said, “We remain invested in India growth story and it remains a key market for us.”</p>
      <p>Vodafone’s India JV has been in deep financial stress, and carries a debt of nearly Rs 1.2 lakh crore. The company, which has slipped into the red after the aggressive entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, was jolted further when the Supreme Court ordered telecom companies (on October 24) to pay back nearly Rs 93,000 crore in past dues. Vodafone-Idea’s share is estimated at over Rs 28,000 crore.</p>
