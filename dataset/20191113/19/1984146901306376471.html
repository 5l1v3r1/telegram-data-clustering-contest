      <h1>Stewart Donald explains the consequences of Sunderland's FPP loan deal</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland owner Stewart Donald says the responsibility to repay the money falls upon the owners, not the football club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:47:06+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Stewart Donald insists the only ones left exposed to any risk by FPP's £9m loan are Sunderland's owners - himself, Charlie Methven and Juan Sartori.</p>
      <p>Papers lodged at Companies House showed that the £9m investment by FPP - the vehicle set up by American billionaires Glenn Fuhrman, John Phelan, and Robert Platek - announced at the end of October has in fact come in the form of a loan to Madrox, the holding company which owns the football club.</p>
      <p>And the loan is secured against the football club, and its assets including the Stadium of Light and the Academy of Light.</p>
      <p>But in an interview on BBC Radio Newcastle's Total Sport, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/stewart-donald">Donald</a> says the debt has been incurred by himself, Methven and Sartori, and it will be their responsibility to repay it - while acknowledging that if they do not do so, the club and its properties would pass to FPP.</p>
      <p>"The investment we have got - or loan, if you want to call it that - is into our holding company Madrox, and that owns <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> in its entireity," said Donald.</p>
      <p>"There are some confidentiality [agreements] around it but I will explain it as best I can, very simply the money has come in and it is secured against everything that Madrox owns.</p>
      <p>"So the only exposure, in reality, is for Juan, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-methven">Charlie</a> and I, because if we don't make good on the repayment, all that basically happens is - what quite a lot of Sunderland fans want, I think - is that the guys who have lent us the money will have control of Madrox.</p>
      <p>"We'd lose the money that we have invested, that would go into the ether, and the American investors would get the lot.</p>
      <p>"They [FPP] only needed security over the shares because the shares control everything but, belt and braces as far as they are concerned, they have secured it against everything.</p>
      <p>"Very simply, they have invested into us, we will invest that money in Sunderland, and if we don't invest it well or if we don't make any repayments on the terms we have agreed, then it [Madrox] defaults to them.</p>
      <p>"The only lose-lose would be for Juan, Charlie and I.</p>
      <p>The reality is that Sunderland has got no debt, the ones that have the debt is ourselves to the Americans."</p>
      <p>Donald also said that they will not default on the loan, insisting that both Juan Sartori and himself - who own 20 percent and 74 percent of Madrox, and through it the football club - could repay the money from their own resources.</p>
      <p>He said: "It won't be defaulted. We can get the money.</p>
      <p>"Juan could put the money in tomorrow, I could put the money in - although Juan would find it easier than me.</p>
      <p>"I could have asked Juan - who indeed offered - to put in the same amount of money [as FPP], but the idea was to get these guys, for a whole host of reasons, and the reality is that Madrox is always going to owe whoever invests in Madrox the money.</p>

      <p>"Madrox currently owes me the best part of £20m."</p>
      <p>Donald says he is bound by a confidentiality agreement which prevents him revealing the when the money has to be repaid.</p>
      <p>He said: "I cannot discuss what their arrangement is with Madrox.</p>
      <p>"The facts that I can divulge are that Sunderland has got no debt, no loan, and Madrox now has a financial arrangement with the investors and that is our responsibility to satisfy."</p>
      <p>Donald says the fact that Fuhrman, Phelan, and Platek, have backed the current owners to the tune of £9m should be seen as a vote of confidence in their stewardship of the club.</p>
      <p>And he rejected suggestions from some fans that the current owners are 'chancers' waiting to 'cash-in'.</p>
      <p>He also revealed that they could have left in the summer and banked a profit in excess of £30m, but opted to stay.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's fair game, you can criticise us for appointing the managers, changing the managers, whatever you like on the football side.</p>
      <p>"But one thing that isn't fair, that isn't right, is that we have come here as chancers to cash in and take the money.</p>
      <p>"We could have quite easily walked away with £30m-plus profit in the summer, but we chose not to do that because the idea was to bring in quality investment.</p>
      <p>"We've had lots of people interested in the club and we got quite a long way down the line with others, but we stopped those in their tracks for this investment.</p>
      <p>"Why have we done that? We have done that because of the people who are involved in investing with us.</p>
      <p>"They are globally reputable, they have wonderful connections.</p>
      <p>"If we can demonstrate to them that their investment has been handled right, that there is a structure and a plan, which I appreciate some fans don't think is right, but fortunately there are some American billionaires with a business track-record who think we are doing a good job.</p>
      <p>"Why have they [FPP] invested? That's really a question for them.</p>
      <p>"But I would imagine they have looked at loads of sports clubs across Europe to invest in, and they have seen a football club that has been turned around.</p>
      <p>"They believe in what we are trying to do and they want to come along for the journey."</p>
