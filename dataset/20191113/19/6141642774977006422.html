      <p>Sir Tim Rice played the piano on an interactive installation at the UK’s largest light festival and declared it “a nice place to play”.</p>
      <p>Durham’s Lumiere festival started 10 years ago and draws thousands of visitors on dark winter nights into the city centre to enjoy free, public art pieces.</p>
      <p>Lyricist and author Sir Tim played the Keys of Light piece, a white piano which boomed out his notes across the city and simultaneously projected light and shapes onto a nearby student block.</p>

      <p>“I’m a bad piano player, but you have to bash it a bit. It’s a nice place to play.”</p>
      <p>Other pieces among the 37 installations include a giant snow globe in the market square, a whale in the Wear and a mysterious fog sculpture.</p>

      <p>Artistic director Helen Marriage said: “This year’s 10th anniversary edition offers the chance to relive some of the wonderful memories of previous festivals, sprinkled as always with an element of surprise.</p>
      <p>“We hope visitors from across the county and beyond join us as we take to the cobbled streets of Durham for four nights of wintry magic.”</p>
