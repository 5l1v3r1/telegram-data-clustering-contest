      <h1>I'm A Celebrity 'chlamydia fears' as koala invades the camp ahead of new series</h1>
      <h2>Many of the koalas in Australia carry the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia and, while unlikely, it is possible for the disease to be transferred over to humans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:54:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>A koala has crawled into the I'm A Celebrity camp for the first time in the show's 17-year history.</p>
      <p>The animal, nicknamed Karl by crew, managed to creep into the jungle set and is "perfectly happy" sleeping above in the trees, the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">Daily Star</a> has reported.</p>
      <p>However his appearance may cause alarm to some as many of the Australian natives carry the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia.</p>
      <p>While it is unlikely that the disease can be passed from koalas to humans, it is possible by urine.</p>
      <p>Series producer Olly Nash told the paper that the celebs need not be alarmed by Karl and that he isn't dangerous - but conceded he was a bit smelly.</p>

      <p>He said: "He’s around here somewhere, he’s on the side of the valley somewhere hanging around a ridge.</p>
      <p>"It’s the first one I’ve ever heard of in the camp. They’re not dangerous but they are a bit smelly.”</p>
      <p>This comes amid news that show bosses are on red alert and “closely monitoring” if they need to evacuate from the jungle site in the coming days after there were huge bushfires in the area.</p>
      <p>At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by a weekend of bushfires in Australia.</p>

      <p>On Sunday, the fire emergency's third day, more than 100 blazes were still burning across New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the military could be called upon to support the 1,300 firefighters working in the two states.</p>
      <p>There have been fires closeby to the site in recent days at Lamington National Park, around 10 kilometres away, and yesterday a fire 2,200 hectares in size and “out of control” was raging at Mount Nardi National Park around 20 kilometres away.</p>
      <p>An ITV Spokesman told the Mirror: “We are in constant contact with the NSW fire brigade and are closely monitoring the situation.  We currently have no cause for concern.  The health and safety of all our production crew and celebrities are of the utmost importance.”</p>
