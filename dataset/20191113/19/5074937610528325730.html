      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA - The Ghana Police Service would commence the construction of 70 prefabricated operational centres to improve community policing and provide additional accommodation.</p>
      <p>The Government would also provide operational vehicles, equipment and other logistics to the Police to ensure efficient service delivery especially before, during and after the 2020 Elections.</p>
      <p>Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, the Minister of Finance, said this during the presentation of the 2020 Budget Statement and Economic Policy in Parliament on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He said the Police Service would intensify activities to minimize the incidence of crime, particularly violent crimes, through increased frontline policing and intelligence gathering.</p>
      <p>That would also help in day and night patrols on major highways, and commercial and residential suburbs in cities across the country to intensify public awareness and education on crime prevention.</p>
