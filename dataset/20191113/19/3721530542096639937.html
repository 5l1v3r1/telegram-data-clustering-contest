      <h1>Rockstar apologizes for Red Dead Redemption 2’s PC problems, promises fixes</h1>

      <p>Rockstar Games apologized to PC players for the rocky launch of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/red-dead-redemption-2/39461"><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i></a>, saying that it’s still working on a few outstanding issues.</p>
      <p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1194669204802281476">Twitter</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61225/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-For-PC-Update">Rockstar Newswire</a>, the developer acknowledged that “a small number of <i>Red Dead</i><i> Redemption 2</i> PC players are still experiencing some ongoing problems with the game stuttering.” An update scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 13, will address the stuttering issue alongside a host of other fixes, Rockstar said.</p>
      <p>“However, we are still currently working together with Nvidia to completely resolve the stuttering issue in a future update,” Rockstar added, “and it may take us up to a few days to properly test everything and ensure the next update completely solves the problem.</p>
      <p>“We sincerely apologize for this temporary inconvenience and will update you as soon as we have more information to share — we want everyone to be able to experience <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> on PC as we intended as soon as possible. If you are experiencing any issues that are impacting your experience with <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> for any reason, please start by first visiting the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/360037908634/RDR2-on-PC-General-Troubleshooting">troubleshooting page on our Support site</a> ...”</p>
      <p>As part of its apology, Rockstar is giving “everyone who plays <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> on PC this week and through to the holiday season will receive a complimentary care package for Red Dead Online that includes the Prieto Poncho and an assortment of provisions and ammo.”</p>
      <p><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> was released on Windows PC on Nov. 5, and players on PC had difficulty simply getting the game to download and install, while others <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/5/20949555/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-crash">experienced crashes to desktop</a> before they could start playing. Rockstar responded to those issues relatively quickly, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/7/20952369/red-dead-redemption-2-rdr2-pc-gameplay-freeze-crash">problems have persisted</a>.</p>
