      <h1>Toyota Camry AWD revealed in the US, but not coming to Australia</h1>
      <h2>Sadly, the new all-paw versions of the Camry and Avalon are solely for North American buyers.</h2>

      <p>The <b>Toyota Camry</b> and <b>Avalon</b> sedans sold in the US will gain the option of all-wheel drive from 2020.</p>
      <p>Sadly for Australians looking for an all-wheel drive family sedan alternative to the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/subaru/liberty/">Subaru Liberty</a> or <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/commodore/">Holden Commodore</a> V6, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/camry/">Camry</a> AWD and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/toyota-avalon/">Avalon</a> AWD are "North America-only models developed in the US and assembled exclusively at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky".</p>
      <p>Australian-market Camry sedans have been imported from Japan since the company ended local vehicle manufacturing at its Altona factory in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>These new North American Camry and Avalon all-wheel drive models are available exclusively with a <b>150kW</b> or <b>153kW</b> 2.5-litre four-cylinder engine and an eight-speed automatic.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Using an adapted version of the Dynamic Torque Control AWD system from the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/rav4/">RAV4</a>, the Camry and Avalon AWD models are able to direct up to 50 per cent of engine torque to the rear wheels as required.</p>
      <p>When all-wheel drive isn't needed, an electromagnetically-controlled coupling disengages the propeller shaft to improve fuel economy.</p>
      <p>The company is hoping to lure back some former family sedan buyers who switched to a crossover vehicle due to their ready availability of all-wheel drive.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Although this the first all-wheel drive Avalon, it isn't the first time AWD has been offered in the Camry, with the option available on some Japanese market models, as well as the 1991 to 1998 American range.</p>
