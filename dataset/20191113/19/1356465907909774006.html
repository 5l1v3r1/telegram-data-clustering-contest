      <h1>French medtech Remedee Labs gets $12 million to validate electric, drug-free treatment for pain management</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.remedee.com/">Remedee Labs</a>, the French medtech pioneering a new electronic treatment for pain, announced it has raised $12 million over the course of this year. The Series A round was led by Hardware Club, with participation from Habert-Dassault Finance, Partech, C4 Ventures, Supernova Invest, plus a group of private investors. The funding will support the next phase of clinical testing for the startup’s breakthrough endorphin-stimulation pain management solution.<br/><br/>Following years of intensive research and development, the company has developed a new approach to pain relief: stimulating a person’s endorphins in the brain – recognized as the body’s highly effective natural pain killer – in a safe, fast, and simple way, and using electricity rather than pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>In fact, the treatment could be self-administered by individual patients. The solution is based on the company’s patented Microelectronic Endorphin Trigger (MEET) module, the first millimeter-wave emitting module for medical usage. Thanks to the miniaturized MEET module, the technology can be implemented in small wearable devices, which makes personal healthcare possible.<br/><br/>Remedee Labs was founded in 2016 in Grenoble, France by three experts in micro and nano medical technologies and biomedical research: Jacques Husser, David Crouzier, and Michael Foerster. Having spent the first years testing the treatment’s scientific viability, the team is ready to make its work public, especially as the global opioid crisis demands new approaches to pain management.<br/><br/>Commenting on the breakthrough technology, president of Hardware Club Alexis Houssou said: “We’re at a groundbreaking moment where technology allows us to go beyond traditional drugs and medication, such as opioids. After seeing Remedee’s work at CEA-Leti, we were blown away by the quality of their team and the scale of their vision. Our investment in this company, and in the future of health as we know it, is truly exciting; the unprecedented early results set the tone for what’s coming next.”</p>
