      <p>(TULSA, Okla.) — Federal prosecutors say a Chinese national employed by a U.S. petroleum company has pleaded guilty in federal court to stealing trade secrets from his employer.</p>
      <p>Authorities say 35-year-old Hongjin Tan pleaded guilty on Tuesday in federal court in Tulsa to theft of a trade secret, unauthorized transmission of a trade secret and unauthorized possession of a trade secret.</p>
      <p>A plea agreement calls for Tan to serve up to two years in prison and pay restitution of $150,000.</p>
      <p>Tan’s attorney, Ryan Ray, hasn’t returned a telephone message seeking comment.</p>
      <p>Court documents indicate Tan worked for Phillips 66 when he stole secrets related to the development of “next generation battery technologies” worth more than $1 billion.</p>
      <p>Sentencing is set for February 2020.</p>
