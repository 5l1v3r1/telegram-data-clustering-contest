      <p>This week has been an exciting ones for fans of Disney and its myriad properties. The House of Mouse officially launched its streaming service, Disney+. Plenty of Marvel Studios movies are streaming, but not all 23 MCU movies <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484463/disney-will-have-more-marvel-movies-available-on-day-one-than-we-thought">are currently available</a> for subscribers. This includes both of Tom Holland's <i>Spider-Man</i> movies, <i>Homecoming</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483978/10-details-from-spider-man-far-from-home-you-may-have-missed">and <i>Far From Home</i></a>. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like those movies will be <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484556/were-partnering-with-disney-to-offer-free-disney-trials">heading to Disney+</a> anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Part of the appeal of Disney+ is the idea of having all of the big franchise's movies in one place, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484511/disneys-version-of-a-new-hope-changes-the-han-solo-and-greedo-scene-in-a-weird-way">like <i>Star Wars</i></a> and the MCU. But many of these blockbusters have to run out their streaming contracts with other services and premium networks first. But Spider-Man's set of solo movies won't be joining the ranks of Disney's new service. As Disney+ head of marketing Ricky Strauss explained:</p>
      <blockquote>We love our friends at Sony, but we don’t have any plans to have the live-action Spider-Man movies on Disney+. We will have all the Spider-Man animated shows that we did so they’ll be on there under the Marvel banner. But who knows what can happen in the future?</blockquote>
      <p>Well, that sucks. It looks like despite how many Marvel movies are eventually added to Disney+, we shouldn't expect Jon Watts' pair of <i>Spider-Man</i> movies to hit the streaming service anytime soon. At least we'll be able to see the wall crawler in other movies like <i>Captain America: Civil War</i> and <i>Endgame</i>.</p>
      <p>Ricky Strauss' comments to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20956671/disney-plus-marvel-spider-man-tom-holland-avengers-endgame-netflix-fox-xmen">The Verge</a> are sure to be disappointing for the hardcore Spider-Man fans out there. While Disney+ has the character's various small screen adventures available, subscribers will also want to see his most recent movie outings. <i>Far From Home</i> and <i>Homecoming</i> were both critical and box office successes, and there are plenty of Disney+ customers who would be interested in re-watching those movies on the new streaming service. If you'd like to try out Disney+, you can <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/410947/705874/9358">use this link for a free 7-day trial</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This update about Disney+ is the latest example of how Spider-Man operates <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483528/yes-disney-and-sonys-spider-man-compromise-was-due-to-the-fans">on a different wavelength</a> than the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Rather than being wholly owned by Disney, Marvel Studios shares custody of Tom Holland's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484339/captain-marvels-ben-mendelsohn-drops-f-bomb-over-spider-mans-temporary-mcu-exit">Peter Parker with Sony</a>. As such, the streaming rights for <i>Far From Home</i> and <i>Homecoming</i> are a bit more complicated.</p>
      <p>While Disney+ subscribers shouldn't hold their breath for Marvel's <i>Spider-Man</i> movies to hit the streaming service, more MCU blockbusters will be added as the months pass. In fact, if you search for movies that aren't currently available, there are dates provided for when it will hit Disney's new service. Unfortunately, that isn't the case for the last two Spider-Man movies.</p>
      <p>The next installment in the MCU is <i>Black Widow</i> on May 1st, 2020.
