      <h1>Pervaiz Elahi plays ‘pivotal’ role in ending JUI-F sit-in</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:16:04+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8304/rizwan-ghilzai/" target="_blank">Rizwan Ghilzai</a></address>
      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>The  trademark ‘conciliatory politics’ of  Chaudhry brothers once again  prevailed in the recent political activity of the country as Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi happened to be the ‘man of crisis’ during the sit-in of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).</p>
      <p>His reconciliatory role in the negotiations pertaining to ‘Azadi March’ between the government and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) prevented a political crisis from occurring.</p>
      <p>From the inception of Azadi March till the announcement of the conclusion of sit-in, Pervaiz Elahi was in continuous contact with Prime Minister Imran Khan, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and other concerned quarters.</p>
      <p>When a deadlock between the government and JUI-F on the issue of deciding the venue of the sit-in occurred, it was due to the efforts and suggestion of Pervaiz Elahi that both the sides agreed to the location of Kashmir Highway.</p>
      <p>On November 1, when JUI-F’s march reached Islamabad, Maulana Fazlur Rehman did not agree for talks despite repeated contacts by the government’s negotiating committee.</p>
      <p>On November 3, a telephonic contact was established between Pervaiz Elahi and Maulana Fazl.</p>
      <p>On November 4, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi reached Islamabad from Lahore and arrived at Maulana Fazl’s residence late night where they were able to convince him to resolve the issue of Azadi March through negotiations.</p>
      <p>On November 5, talks between government’s negotiating committee and opposition parties’ Rehbar Committee began.</p>
      <p>When the talks between the government and opposition committees did not succeed, Prime Minister Imran Khan taking advantage of the cordial relations between the Chaudhry brothers and Maulana Fazl assigned complete responsibility of negotiations to Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi.</p>
      <p>During this period, Elahi met the premier and advised him to bar the government representatives from giving hard-hitting statements against maulana’s Azadi March.</p>
      <p>On the suggestion of Elahi, PM Imran stopped the government officials from issuing anti-Azadi March statements.</p>
      <p>Elahi held four meetings with the JUI-F chief in the 48 hours and also remained in contact with the prime minister and other high-ranking officials.</p>
      <p>As a result, maulana softened his stance and the government offered the formation of a judicial commission or parliamentary party for the investigation of rigging in election.</p>
      <p>When Maulana Fazl started mulling over his plan ‘B’, Pervaiz Elahi again took the reins and convinced the JUI-F chief to carry on with his strategy in a peaceful manner and ensured him that there would be no use of force against his peaceful protest.</p>
      <p>Despite his ailing health, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi continued to review the entire situation, which resulted in the conclusion of Azadi March sit-in in a peaceful manner.</p>
