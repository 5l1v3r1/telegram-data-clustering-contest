      <p>Over at the Cuisine District, up to 30 merchants will be serving up delectable dishes, mouthwatering snacks, and refreshing beverages. Organized by Mercato Centrale, guests can expect a curated selection of sumptuous Filipino and international food choices from home-based vendors.  Those who are gifted with a green thumb may consider dropping by the Green District. Organized in partnership with the Landscape Management Group and Ayala Property Management Corporation, it will offer more than just succulents and houseplants (although there will be plenty of those, too). </p>

      <p>Several performances await shoppers and those looking to hang out with friends and loved ones. Every evening, from 5:30 to 11:00 p.m., the Globe Circuit Events Grounds will set the stage for CineCircuit outdoor movie screenings, contemporary arts and dance performances, live chorale performances, and sets by some of OPM’s finest—indie band Munimuni on Nov. 15, Inadayo on Nov. 16, and Lola Amour on Nov. 17.  Shoppers and other guests can enjoy taking photos at the Interactive Wall Mural along Symphony Drive, which was painted by artist Nini Andrada Sacro with the help of artistic Makatizens.  Reg Yuson’s artwork located by the water along Circuit Lane will be unveiled soon.</p>
