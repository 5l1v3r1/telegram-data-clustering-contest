      <h2>Google says this makes it easier for users to add another destination on their planned route</h2>

      <p>Google Maps will soon start showing tiny <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/ads/local-ads/">branded location pins</a> for stores and restaurants near you while in navigation mode.</p>
      <p>The tech giant has been increasingly monetizing Maps through ads. The location pins in Maps recently started featuring a store’s logo in the standard mode, and now the logo will appear in navigation mode as well.</p>
      <p>Google sees this as a way for users to add another destination on their planned route. Now, when you tap on a branded location, you have the option to add it as a stop.</p>

      <p>“In the coming weeks, you’ll be able to feature your locations as users get directions to a destination. In just a few taps, they can add you as a convenient stop along their route to grab lunch, stop in for shopping, and more,” Google stated in a <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/ads/local-ads/">blog post. </a></p>
      <p>For the holiday season, Google has allowed stores to create a visual catalogue to advertise their products on the Map app. To demonstrate the feature, Google has used Dunkin Donuts, which isn’t available in Canada.</p>
      <p>The branded pins will be rolling out globally to both Android and iOS users in the next few weeks.</p>
