      <h1>Here are a ton of pictures of Moto's new foldable Razr hours before it's announced</h1>

      <p>Motorola is set to unveil the long-rumored foldable Razr phone later today, but the FCC beat Moto to the punch. Thanks to a bungled confidentiality request, the FCC has posted numerous images of the phone's exterior, along with some of the innards. The device looks very much like the leaks suggested.</p>
      <p>The rebooted Razr looks not unlike a traditional smartphone when it's open, save for that giant Razr-style chin. The chin houses a front-facing fingerprint sensor, and there's a small display notch at the top for the earpiece and sensors. The hinge system looks a bit bulbous in the photos, particularly when closed. See below. There's a display on the outside you can see when the phone is closed, but the photos don't have enough contrast to tell how large it is.</p>

      <p>The FCC also included an image of the device's main board, confirming a Snapdragon 710 SoC. You don't see many of those stateside. The battery might be a problemâ€”the FCC report includes a photo of one 1165mAh cell. There might be two batteries in the phone (one in each half), but that's still not much capacity.</p>

      <p>This leak comes as Motorola is teasing the full phone unveiling. The company just changed its <a href="https://twitter.com/MotorolaUS/header_photo">Twitter header image</a> to a silhouette of the phone from the side. It's too late now, Moto. We've seen everything.</p>
