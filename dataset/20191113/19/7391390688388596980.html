      <p>In the current age of superhero movies, it seems as if every comic book character who makes it to the screen is launching their own franchise — and if one actor has his way, the Joker will be among them. During a recent interview with the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-13/joaquin-phoenix-joker-fan-theories-sequel-oscars">Joaquin Phoenix revealed that he really wants to make a </a><i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-13/joaquin-phoenix-joker-fan-theories-sequel-oscars">Joker</a></i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-13/joaquin-phoenix-joker-fan-theories-sequel-oscars"> sequel</a>. In fact, he's been pitching the idea of a follow up to director Todd Phillips since before they even finished the movie.</p>
      <p>Phoenix may have been hesitant to sign on to play the iconic DC Comics villain, but he told the <i>LA Times</i> that once he began <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/arthur-fleck-isnt-in-the-batman-comics-because-joker-isnt-a-comic-book-movie-18760138">delving into the psyche of Arthur Fleck</a>, he just wanted to know more. "In the second or third week of shooting, I was like, 'Todd, can you start working on a sequel?'" Phoenix told the outlet. "There’s way too much to explore. It was kind of in jest — but not really."</p>
      <p>Though Phillips told the <i>LA Times </i>that there are currently <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-joker-get-a-sequel-not-if-director-todd-phillips-has-his-way-18790910">no plans for a <i>Joker</i> sequel</a>, one of the things that Phoenix enjoyed most about the character — which would lend itself easily to more films — is the idea that audiences can't be sure how much of <a href="https://screenrant.com/joker-movie-not-real-arthur-fleck-mind-theory/">the film is taking place in Arthur's head</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s been super interesting how people react to the movie and what they see — and to me, all of those answers are valid," he said about the various <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/10/joker-ending-fan-theories-explain-batman-and-arthur-fleck-character/"><i>Joker </i>fan theories floating around</a> the Internet. "Normally you have to answer those questions. But this really is participatory and interactive. It’s up to the audience." However, Phoenix <i>did</i> admit that he thinks Arthur is the real Joker, though he's willing to hear any theories that prove otherwise.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time that Phoenix has shown appreciation for the response that <i>Joker</i> and Arthur have received since the film's release in early October. “It’s a difficult film. In some ways, it’s good that people are having a strong reaction to it," the actor told <i>Vanity Fair </i>in October, referencing <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/joker-criticism-fallout-891081/">the backlash that the movie earned</a> for its graphic violence and depiction of mental illness.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Phillips told the <i>LA Times</i> that people have actually reached out to him after seeing <i>Joker</i>, in order to thank him for his <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/23/what-joker-movie-gets-right-wrong-about-mental-illness-violence/3978028002/">portrayal of someone struggling</a> with mental illness. "I get emails from people telling me that the movie made them look at their sister who suffers from schizophrenia in a different light," he said, describing the audience reception as most "vindicating" part of releasing <i>Joker</i>. "Ultimately, the movie is about the power of kindness and the lack of empathy in the world, and the audience seems to have picked up on that."</p>
      <p>For now, though, both <i>Joker</i> fans and Phoenix himself will simply have to wait and see whether that overwhelming fan reaction is enough to inspire a sequel.</p>
