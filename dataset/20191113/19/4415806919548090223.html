      <p>Tyson Fury has opened up about his mental health problems, revealing at one point he believed he was “being tortured by demons”.</p>

      <p>Fury explained how he had gone to the pub dressed in a skin-tight skeleton costume at the height of his drinking and mental health issues and decided to return home early.</p>

      <p>“At that point I knew I couldn’t do it on my own,” he said. “I got on my knees and, for the first time in my life, I knew I couldn’t stop going to the pub (and stop) eating on my own.</p>
      <p>“I was crying. When I arose, I was bouncing with excitement. I had faith that everything was going to be alright.”</p>
      <p>Fury spoke of the importance of his religious beliefs and admitted to a possible psychosis diagnosis by his psychiatrist, who claimed in the book that “without faith, he would have killed himself”.</p>
      <p>Fury added: “At one point I believed I was being tortured by demons. When you’re really mentally unwell, you do see and hear things.”</p>

      <p>Fury also opened up about some of the abuse and mistreatment he has faced as a member of the travelling community.</p>
      <p>He said: “I used to get called disgusting names. I was bullied quite a bit as a kid until I got big and started fighting back.</p>
      <p>“I have been refused entry to pubs and restaurants because I’m a traveller.”</p>
