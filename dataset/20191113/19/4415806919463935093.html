      <p>Strictly’s Oti Mabuse has joked that she feared for her life during a complicated lift with celebrity partner Kelvin Fletcher.</p>
      <p>The pair showed off the tricky move in their routine on the BBC show at the weekend. They had rehearsed an even harder version but had to simplify it a little on the night.</p>

      <p>When she appeared on spin-off It Takes Two, Mabuse was asked by host Zoe Ball if she was fearing for her life, and admitted: “I was!”</p>
      <p>She explained: “With Kelvin, every week he starts really slow and then he progresses incredibly, so when we were doing it we were doing it really slow and I was like, ‘How about we do this, you have your hands up and I have my hands up?’</p>
      <p>“On Wednesday he gets faster and I almost fly across the room! I was like, ‘Oh my God’.</p>
      <p>“So we had to adjust it.”</p>
      <p>“That was scary,” she added.</p>
      <p>The pair are now gearing up for Blackpool Week – one of the highlights of the competition.</p>

      <p>Fletcher said he could not believe he had made it there after coming into the show late to replace injured Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing.</p>
      <p>He said: “I wasn’t even supposed to be here. I’m here and I’m going to Blackpool.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had that many holidays in Blackpool being from the North West … and Blackpool was the holiday destination. Amazing place.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been to the Tower Ballroom before, my nan and grandad watched people dance and now I’m going to be dancing there with Oti Mabuse!”</p>
      <p>“It’s unbelievable, I could never have imagined it,” he added.</p>
