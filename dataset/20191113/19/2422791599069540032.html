      <h1>Trump says decision on tariffs for imported cars coming 'very soon'</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump says he "will make a decision very soon" about whether to impose tariffs on imported cars and auto parts.</p>
      <p>It was unclear whether he would meet a Wednesday deadline to decide.</p>
      <p>In May, Trump declared that auto imports posed a threat to U.S. national security that could justify tariffs or other sanctions. But he put off a decision for six months, pending trade talks with the European Union.</p>
      <p>Turning to a little-used weapon in U.S. trade policy, Trump also cited national security last year when he slapped tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.</p>
      <p>Targeting autos would mark a major escalation in Trump's aggressive trade policies. The United States last year imported $192 billion worth of cars and light trucks and $159 billion worth of auto parts.</p>
      <p>In September, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Trump had assured him that an existing agreement to spare Japan from new auto tariffs still stood. The U.S. and Japan signed a limited trade agreement in October that did not address autos. But Trump said the two countries are working on a more comprehensive deal.</p>
      <p>Last week, outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he did not think Trump would go ahead with the auto tariffs.</p>
      <p>Trump's tariffs -- especially the levies he's imposed on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports -- have unsettled businesses and contributed to an economic slowdown in the United States and abroad.</p>
