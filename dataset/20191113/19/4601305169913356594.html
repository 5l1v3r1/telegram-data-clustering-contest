      <p>Chris Wallace of Fox News was impressed with Ambassador William Taylor's testimony in today's impeachment hearings:</p>
      <blockquote>"William Taylor was a very impressive witness and was very damaging to the president. First of all, as you pointed out, he took very copious notes at almost every conversation... I think very nonpolitical. He went out of his way to talk about what he knew, what he was specifically testament to. The only thing he talked about was a strong feeling that it was in the U.S. national security interests to support Ukraine in the fight against Russia. But he certainly wasn't taking any partisan position."</blockquote>
