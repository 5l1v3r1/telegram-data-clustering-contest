      <h1>Republicans shrug off impeachment hearings</h1>
      <h2>Even Trump is 'too busy to watch'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:31:26+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:31</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Liptak, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Heading into Wednesday's <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/public-impeachment-hearings-day-1/index.html">first public impeachment hearing</a>, Republicans had argued the facts weren't there to impeach <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/president-donald-trump-45">President Donald Trump</a>. And they complained the proceedings were taking place behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>But as the televised testimony got underway, they adopted a new talking point: the hearings were just dull.</p>
      <p>"This sham hearing is not only boring, it is a colossal waste of taxpayer time &amp; money," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted.</p>
      <p>The President's son Eric echoed her.</p>
      <p>"This is horribly boring..." he wrote on Twitter. "#Snoozefest."</p>
      <p>As lawmakers took a break midday — after learning an explosive new detail from top US diplomat in Ukraine <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/politics/who-is-bill-taylor/index.html">Bill Taylor </a>about Trump's interest in the country investigating his political rivals — some Republicans said they couldn't keep their eyes open.</p>
      <p>"I don't know about you, but it's hard for me to stay awake and listen to all of this," GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolinian and a top Trump ally, told lawmakers.</p>
      <p>Whether the hearing proves boring to the American people remains to be seen. Some Democrats have privately expressed concerns that the sheer volume of information — key players, dates and allegations — could prove confusing to the public.</p>
      <p>Trump himself told reporters in the Oval Office he'd been too busy to watch the proceedings as they began earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>"I did not watch it. I'm too busy to watch it," he said. "It's a witch hunt, it's a hoax. I'm too busy to watch it. So I'm sure I'll get a report."</p>
