      <h1>Class action over fudged Volkswagen emissions tests can go ahead: Supreme Court</h1>

      <p>OTTAWA - The Supreme Court has rejected an attempt by Volkswagen and Audi to dismiss a class action in Quebec seeking compensation for air pollution from cars that gave false results in emissions tests.</p>
      <p>The judges made the decision in a rare ruling from the bench just after hearing arguments, saying the case can go ahead.</p>
      <p>The auto manufacturers, part of the same corporate family, are facing a suit seeking $35 for each Quebecer after revelations in 2015 that certain models of cars were equipped with software that could detect when their emissions were being tested.</p>
      <p>The company admitted that during tests, some of its cars would change the way their engines functioned to produce much less pollution than they would normally.</p>
      <p>The class action covers every Quebecer, on the grounds that everyone breathed air contaminated by the cars.</p>
      <p>With 8.3 million people in Quebec, the suit led by an anti-air-pollution group could cost the carmakers nearly $300 million if it succeeds.</p>
