      <h1>This cryptocurrency exchange was actually a $384 million Ponzi scheme</h1>
      <h2>CoinUp execs promised coins would go up after non-existent listings</h2>

      <p>The CEO of South Korean cryptocurrency “exchange” CoinUp has been sentenced to 16 years prison for his role in defrauding investors out of 450 billion won ($384 million), <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20191111123600004?input=1195m">Yonhap News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kang-mo, alongside a raft of his executives, were found to have deceived thousands of CoinUp customers by promising returns of up to 200 percent on cryptocurrency investments, just 4-to-10 weeks after purchase.</p>
      <p>A judge also sentenced the firm’s chief financial officers, Mr. Kwon and Mr. Shinmo, to 11 years in prison. CoinUp’s “governor” Mr. Yunmo was given 7 years imprisonment, alongside his mother-in-law.</p>
      <p>Several other executives were reportedly sentenced to between six and nine years in prison.</p>
      <h3>CoinUp promised crypto prices would increase after listing</h3>
      <p>The investments CoinUp execs shilled had little-to-no chance of increasing in value. Local outlet TVCC <a href="http://tvccnews.co.kr/news/view.php?idx=3915">reported</a> that CoinUp execs would convince their victims to invest by promising to list the coins in the near future.</p>
      <p>Even more curious, investigators found that Kang-mo had displayed a fake magazine in CoinUp offices that showed him standing alongside South Korean president Moon Jae-in, presumably in a bid to mislead potential investors.</p>

      <p>The Seoul Central District Court noted CoinUp operated as a multi-level organization that ensured those who invested early were rewarded directly with the profits generated by those who invested later — which bears the hallmarks of a classic pyramid scheme.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, South Korean police employed a special “artificial intelligence investigator” to identify investment scams, leading them to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/08/south-korea-bitcoin-pyramid-cryptocurrency-ai-scam/">arrest the masterminds</a> of a $19 million Bitcoin-fueled Ponzi scheme.</p>
