      <p>Sally Dexter has hinted that she will return to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> as Faith Dingle.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old actress has finished filming her scenes as Faith, who she has portrayed on the ITV soap since 2017, but could viewers see her comeback so soon?</p>
      <p>On today's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> (Wednesday November 13) host Phillip Schofield asked: "You have left and said it was really emotional those final scenes, but you'd love to go back?"</p>
      <p>Sally replied: "Who wouldn't? It's sort of irresistible. I do feel like I've left family up there, and we're still in touch."</p>

      <p>She continued: "They're coming down to see me in the show.</p>
      <p>"It's so peculiar but I do feel like I have a son and a daughter, a granddaughter and several great-grandchildren. It feels like that."</p>
      <p>Sally is currently focusing on her upcoming new role as Fan Marley, Ebenezer Scrooge's sister, in a production of A Christmas Carol, and admits it is her "most challenging" role to date.</p>

      <p>She said:  "This is the most challenging thing I think I've ever done, and possibly the most exciting.</p>
      <p>"Going back to theatre, I was kind of thinking it's going to be so much easier. You've got all this rehearsal time.</p>
      <p>"Then suddenly you do it and you think, 'It's not that easy at all.' "</p>
      <p>Sally <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/faith-dingle-to-leave-emmerdale-in-as-sally-dexter-confirms-exit/">confirmed her Emmerdale departure</a> just last month, admitting she had already set her sights on a part in Line of Duty.</p>

      <p>She exclusively told BANG Showbiz: "I'm taking a bit of a break from Emmerdale, because of the explosive storyline that's happening between Cain and Moira, and of course Faith and Nate."</p>
      <p>But Sally isn't sure how long she will be away from the Dales for.</p>
      <p>When asked if she wanted to take a break, she said: "Yes, I just want to see what's around.</p>
      <p>"I love Emmerdale and the team, I love my Dingle family very much.</p>

      <p>"I don't know how long the break is for at the moment."</p>
      <p>And she would love to land a role in some gritty dramas, such as BBC One show Line of Duty.</p>
      <p>She said: "Line of Duty would be great. Stuff like that I would love to do. That would be absolutely fabulous.</p>
      <p>"Filming of all sorts I really, really love."</p>
