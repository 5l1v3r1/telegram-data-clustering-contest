      <h1>'It really is time to retire' - Food Sleuth goes out on a high at Copper during the wettest autumn in memory</h1>
      <h2>“This must be new," I confided to the waitress. "No, we’ve been here for years.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:43:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Jeremy Lewis</a></address>
      <p>During the wettest autumn in memory, my experiences have included aquaplaning down the A612 all the way from Burton Joyce to Lowdham and creating a hedge-drenching bow wave on the rat-run between Cotgrave and Normanton on the Wolds.</p>
      <p>Hence my resolution to dine this week on high ground. I don’t wish to see my trusty chariot drifting down the Trent Valley behind a big wooden boat with a couple of giraffe necks poking out of the portholes.</p>
      <p>In Greater Nottingham, high ground means Mapperley Top … but that didn’t stop another deluge at noon on Tuesday when I splashed off the puddly pavement of Woodborough Road and into the local manifestation of Copper, a reliable local bar-restaurant brand.</p>
      <p>“This must be new so I thought I’d give it a try,” I confided to the waitress. Drawing on her reserves of patience, she politely replied: “No, we’ve been here for years.” Once again, I am off the pace. It really is time to retire.</p>
      <p>Chef and the front-of-house team maintain the Copper standard. I have troughed it at both the West Bridgford and Market Street restaurants and Mapperley does the same: good ingredients get the treatment they deserve and are presented stylishly in pleasantly modern surroundings by eager, well-scrubbed staff. That makes it 7.5 out of 10.</p>
      <p>You won’t miss Copper even in this busy suburban hospitality outpost, marginally in the borough of Gedling. Those of you who have attended a school will recognise the “Cu” on the restaurant windows. It is the chemical symbol for Copper, derived from the Latin word Cuprum.</p>
      <p>Chef scored heavily with my starter, the soup of the day being a thick roast tomato and basil job, served with good bread and a pat of butter that broke every rule in the Nottingham Restaurant Manual: it came at room temperature, in spreadable form, rather than straight from the refrigerator.</p>
      <p>This was lovely broth, perhaps with a hint of chilli heat, and it took some of the pain out of the weather.</p>
      <p>Next, fish and chips. Cod, to be precise. When it comes to cooking in batter, I’m a haddock man (and I can thoroughly recommend the haddock and chips at the Mapperley Fish Bar, a few doors down the road).</p>
      <p>However this was nicely done, served with some deliciously nutty mushy peas contained in one of those little copper saucepans you see hanging from every West Bridgford kitchen wall, and some very thick chips – five of them, stacked like spare timber sleepers at a railway depot. Or, nowadays, a garden centre.</p>
      <p>Also on the plate was a large puddle of something approximating tartare sauce. It was, however, too runny to be the real thing.</p>
      <p>Dessert? I scanned the menu and gave most points to the chocolate and coconut tart and the bread and butter pudding. I had, however, been seduced by the sight of half a dozen gorgeous looking cakes, paraded on the bar on plates with glass covers.</p>
      <p>They were all lookers, with lashings of icing and buttercream fillings at least 12mm thick, but the one that begged my attention was the coffee and walnut number. She was light and fluffy – personally, I prefer a bit more weight – and full of coffee character.</p>
      <p>This being autumn 2019, it was still raining heavily as I departed, like a scene from Blade Runner. Alas, I was in no fit shape to run for the chariot.</p>
