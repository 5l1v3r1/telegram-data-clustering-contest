        <b>FIFA has hired Arsene Wenger in a full-time role leading its global work developing soccer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Arsenal manager accepted Fifa's offer more than two months after it was first reported, and one week after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10318535/wenger-arsenal-bayern-munich-manager/">talks with Bayern Munich</a> about the German champions vacant head coach job.</p>

      <p>Fifa says <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/arsene-wenger/">Wenger</a>'s title will be Chief of Global Football Development.</p>
      <p>He will oversee the rules-making panel known as IFAB, coaching programs and technical analysis of games at Fifa tournaments.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old Frenchman effectively replaces Marco van Basten who was Fifa technical director until October 2018.</p>
      <p>Wenger has worked as an analyst for broadcasters since leaving Arsenal last year after 22 seasons.</p>
      <p>He led Arsenal to three Premier League titles, seven FA Cup trophies, and was beaten finalist in the 2006 Champions League and 2000 Uefa Cup.</p>
