      <h1>Desiigner Says He’s Officially Off G.O.O.D. Music</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:29:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/JustinI" target="_blank">Justin Ivey</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52223/title.desiigner-says-he-spends-20k-on-uber-a-month">Desiigner</a> has revealed he’s an independent artist once again. During a recent Instagram livestream, the “Panda” creator noted he secured his release from Kanye West’s label <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.45272/title.cyhi-the-prynce-explains-split-with-g-o-o-d-music">G.O.O.D. Music</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m on my own vibe,” he said. “I couldn’t have nobody holding me up. That’s why I had to get off that label, man. Ain’t no funny shit. Ain’t nobody dropped me. I asked for the release.”</p>

      <p>He also clarified he’s not signed to anyone now and working through his own imprint called L.O.D.</p>
      <p>“The only label I’m on right now is L.O.D.,” he said. “I can drop whenever, however, how high, how low. I can drop to the left, to the right, to the front, to the back! I can drop anywhere, any second. This is the dream of every artist!”</p>
      <p>Desiigner signed with G.O.O.D. in 2016 but never released a studio album during his time on the label. Throughout 2019, the multi-platinum rapper voiced his frustrations with G.O.O.D. via social media.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, he also took aim at Kanye in an Instagram video.</p>
      <p>“Nobody is doing this shit for me,” Desiigner said, “I had signed to Kanye West, the biggest nigga. Y’all niggas think he’s the genius. Y’all think all that nigga’s shit. But to me that nigga’s crazy. To me, I’ve been doing this shit myself. To me, I brought G.O.O.D. Music back.”</p>
