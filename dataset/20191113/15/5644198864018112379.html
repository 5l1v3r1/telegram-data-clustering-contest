      <p>GAZA CITY: Two Palestinians were killed in Israeli air and missile strikes on Gaza early Wednesday (Nov 13), the territory's health ministry said, taking the death toll from a two-day flare-up to 12.</p>
      <p>Israel launched deadly strikes against commanders of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad early Tuesday triggering a wave of tit-for-tat rocket salvoes and air strikes.</p>

      <p>Islamic Jihad said one of the two men killed on Wednesday was a member, identifying him as Khaled Fawwaj.</p>
      <p>The Israeli military said it carried out a series of strikes on Islamic Jihad targets on Wednesday in response to new rocket fire from Gaza.</p>
      <p>It said one of the targets was a rocket launching squad which it hit.</p>
      <p>Air raid sirens sounded in the Israeli towns of Ashkelon and Netivot near the Gaza border.</p>
      <p>Since Israel's targeted killing of Islamic Jihad commander Baha Abu al-Ata on Tuesday morning, at least 220 rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza without causing any deaths, the military said.</p>
      <p>Israeli air defences intercepted 90 per cent of the rockets, it added.</p>
