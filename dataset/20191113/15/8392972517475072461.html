      <p>Season three of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/drama-tv/fans-spot-historical-error-in-the-crown-s3-trailer/">The Crown</a> is set to be released on Netflix this weekend and we're guessing one will not be amused when she hears the comments made by one of the stars of the show.</p>
      <p>Josh O'Connor, who plays Prince Charles in the royal drama, has said that the Queen "has to die" in order for Prince Charles's life to have "meaning".</p>

      <p>Although Charles will only take the throne once the Queen passes away, or if she abdicates, it's a pretty harsh comment to make.</p>

      <p>The comments will no doubt do little to enamour the real-life monarch to the show.</p>
      <p>Back in the summer it was claimed that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/the-queen-reportedly-upset-by-the-crown/">she was "upset" about how the show depicted her husband Prince Philip</a> and his treatment of son Charles.</p>
