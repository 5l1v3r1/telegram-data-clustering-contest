      <h1>Ashton Kutcher 'is ignoring' Demi Moore's memoir containing accusations about cheating and threesomes</h1>
      <h2>Moore discusses her past marriage extensively in 'Inside Out'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:26:21+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Clémence Michallon</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AshtonKutcher">Ashton Kutcher</a> is reportedly ignoring <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DemiMoore">Demi Moore</a>’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/memoir">memoir</a> in which she accuses him of infidelity.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=3659&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://people.com/movies/ashton-kutcher-has-pretty-much-ignored-demi-moores-revealing-memoir-he-has-moved-on/"><i>People</i></a>, Kutcher, who was married to Moore from 2005 to 2013, “pretty much ignores” the book.</p>
      <p>“He is busy with a full life and has moved on,” one source close to Kutcher told the magazine.</p>
      <p>In <i>Inside Out</i>, Moore alleges that Kutcher cheated on her with a 21-year-old woman whom she says he met during a family outing at a bowling alley.</p>
      <p>She also alleges that Kutcher at one point “expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed”, resulting in threesomes.</p>
      <p>In the memoir, Moore links that experience with Kutcher’s alleged infidelity, writing: "Because we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’d done."</p>
      <p>Kutcher is now married to his former <i>That ‘70s Show</i> co-star Mila Kunis, with whom he has two children.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=3659&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://people.com/movies/why-ashton-kutcher-wont-address-demi-moores-cheating-allegations-he-respects-shes-a-mother/"><i>People</i></a> previously quoted a source as saying of Kutcher: "Ashton has never spoken about [Moore].</p>
      <p>"He hasn’t talked about her since the divorce, and he never will. He respects that she’s a mother with a family."</p>
      <p><i>The Independent</i> has contacted Kutcher’s publicist for comment.</p>
