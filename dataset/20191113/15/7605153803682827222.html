        <b>HARARE, Zimbabwe, Nov 13 – </b>
        <b>Cash-strapped Zimbabweans began using new banknotes and coins Tuesday, as the nation’s central bank seeks to ease chronic shortages.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Zimbabwean dollar is being gradually reintroduced, after being rendered worthless by decades of economic mismanagement under former president Robert Mugabe.</b>

      <p>That forced the country to rely on US dollars for a decade.</p>
      <p>New two- and five-dollar notes were disbursed by the central bank on Monday.</p>
      <p>One Zimbabwean dollar is currently worth around six US cents.</p>
      <p>“Bond” notes – a legal tender pegged to the US dollar – were introduced in 2016 to alleviate chronic cash shortages and ease a transition back to Zimbabwean dollars.</p>
      <p>These were then supplemented with electronic RTGS dollars in June 2019.</p>
      <p>But cash remains hard to come by, and most people use mobile money and now-banned foreign currencies to pay for goods.</p>
      <p>Withdrawals remain capped at a maximum of 300 new Zimbabwean dollars ($18) per week per customer – which buys less than three kilogrammes of beef.</p>
      <p>Account holders wait long hours to draw cash.</p>
      <p>In Zimbabwe’s capital Harare, bank customers remained sceptical.</p>
      <p>“There is no difference,” Milton Mushangwe, 37, told AFP. “The withdrawal limits remain the same.”</p>
      <p>“We are still getting the same small amount of 100 dollars or less,” added another customer, Richard Govha.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe’s reserve bank said that only 31 million new Zimbabwean dollars (less than $2 million) had been disbursed so far, of a planned total of one billion that is to be drip-fed into the system over the next six months.</p>
