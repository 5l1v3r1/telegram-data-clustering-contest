      <p>With only five to seven years to live, Ruckstuhl’s son, Joshuah, sent a tweet to retired NHLer Paul Bissonnette hoping to catch his attention – and it worked. As part of the “NHL First Timer” video series, the league surprised Ruckstuhl at his house and took him and sons Joshuah and Ryan to a game where the Leafs faced off against Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>“I’ve waited 52 years for something like this,” Ron said in the clip.</p>
      <p>While Joshuah added, “I’d never seen my dad smile and laugh (like that)… For a little bit, you didn’t realize he was sick. You could see him forget about being sick for just a little bit.”</p>

      <p>NHL chief content officer Steve Mayer said it was an honour to celebrate such a dedicated fan.</p>
      <p>“This is what it’s all about,” he said. “To be able to put joy in somebody’s life like Ron’s and to be able to show his story to the world is quite an honour and it makes me proud to be a part of the NHL.”</p>
