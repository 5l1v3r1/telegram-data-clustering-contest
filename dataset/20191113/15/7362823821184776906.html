      <h1>Tim Ryan endorses Biden despite past campaign trail criticism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:50:46+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Steinhauser</a></address>
      <p>In endorsing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-ryan-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race-announces-house-re-election-campaign">Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio</a> called <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">the former vice president</a> a “trusted leader” and someone who “will not only be a voice for workers and the middle class" but who "will get things done.”</p>
      <p>But when Ryan – <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-ryan-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race-announces-house-re-election-campaign">who ended his own bid</a> for the Democratic presidential nomination late last month – was running for the White House, the Democrat was much more critical.</p>

          <b>RYAN DOESN'T BACK OFF COMMENT THAT BIDEN'S 'DECLINING'</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Jabbing at Biden in early September, Ryan made headlines by telling Bloomberg News that he didn’t think the 76-year-old Biden "has the energy" to be president. "You see it almost daily,” he said.</p>
      <p>Asked about those comments two days later at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ryan-says-hes-not-backtracking-from-earlier-comments-that-bidens-declining">Ryan</a> said, “We have got to have a very crisp, sharp, articulate message for the people going into the fall with Donald Trump….It’s unclear sometimes when he’s (Biden) articulating positions and I’ll leave it at that.”</p>
      <p>A few weeks later, speaking with Fox News, the 46-year old Ryan highlighted Biden’s age, saying, “I think a generational change is what we need.”</p>
      <p>Biden’s campaign spelled trouble for Ryan ever since the former vice president jumped into the race in late April. Ryan was a center-left candidate who touted his heartland heritage and his ability to connect with the white working-class voters in the Rust Belt who helped elect Trump in 2016  by giving him crucial states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But Biden also highlights his working-class roots and his ability to connect with blue-collar voters. And Ryan – struggling to gain traction and failing to make the autumn debate stage – ended his White House bid on Oct. 24.</p>

      <p>But even while he was critical of Biden during his campaign for the president, Ryan repeatedly noted that he greatly respected the former vice president.</p>
      <p>And in announcing his endorsement on Wednesday, Ryan spotlighted: “I know that Joe will be a voice for the many who are being left behind  — workers losing their jobs to automation, unions fighting for fair wages, small business owners trying to get ahead. Joe knows that working communities built America, and I know that Joe will go to bat for them as an increasingly globalized economy threatens the very work they do.”</p>
