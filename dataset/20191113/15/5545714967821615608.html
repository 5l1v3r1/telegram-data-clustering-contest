      <p>Independent studios Dim Bulb and Serenity Forge <a href="https://twitter.com/SerenityForge/status/1192851397168877568?s=20">have announced</a> that tall tale adventure <i>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine</i> will be coming to consoles later this month, following on from its quiet release on PC in early 2018.<br/><br/><i>Where the Water</i>... is a unique period piece which has the player step into the well-worn shoes of a weary traveler, who is wandering the exhausting plains of Depression-era America. Along the way, the player will meet a wide variety of diverse strangers, all carrying the weight of their own experiences, each with their own stories to tell about the hand that life has dealt them.<br/><br/>Using these very stories, players can curry the attention and favour of other characters, trading learned experiences to discover the deeper meanings behind each character's past. While treading the towns, deserts and woodlands of America, the player must also manage hunger and fatigue, while keeping an eye out for better and faster methods of transportation.</p>
