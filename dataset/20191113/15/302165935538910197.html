      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 13 — Jay-Z and Iconix Brand Group Inc have settled a series of legal disputes arising from transactions between the rapper and the clothing licensing company dating back to 2007.</p>
      <p>In a regulatory filing today, Iconix said it agreed to sell some intellectual property assets to Jay-Z’s Roc Nation LLC and membership interests in his Marcy Media Holdings LLC affiliate, in exchange for US$15 million (RM62 million).</p>
      <p>Iconix said both sides also agreed to drop all claims against each other, without admitting wrongdoing or unlawful conduct.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Jay-Z and Roc Nation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Jay-Z, 49, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, is worth US$1 billion, a fortune he built through his music, Roc Nation, the streaming service Tidal, Armand de Brignac champagne, and investments such as Uber, <i>Forbes</i> magazine said.</p>
      <p>The settlement ends an April 2017 lawsuit in the federal court in Manhattan in which Iconix accused Jay-Z of infringing trademarks it acquired a decade earlier in a US$204 million purchase of his Rocawear clothing brand.</p>
      <p>It also resolves a private arbitration related to that sale, and a July 2019 lawsuit in a New York state court in Manhattan in which Jay-Z accused Iconix of fraudulently doing business with Roc Nation as part of a “colossal accounting scandal.”</p>
      <p>Iconix has written off almost the entire value of the Rocawear brand. It said yesterday it took a US$5.5 million charge after agreeing in principle to resolve a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe into its writedowns.</p>
      <p>The arbitration drew additional attention after Jay-Z complained that too few African-American arbitrators had been eligible to hear the case. He dropped his objection once enough arbitrators were found.</p>
      <p>Iconix is based in New York, and has dozens of brands including Candie’s, Danskin, Fieldcrest, Joe Boxer, London Fog, Mossimo, Pony and Starter.</p>
      <p>Jay-Z is married to pop star Beyonce, and known for such songs as <i>Hard Knock Life</i>, <i>99 Problems</i> and <i>Big Pimpin</i>.</p>
      <p>The cases are Iconix Brand Group Inc et al v Roc Nation Apparel Group LLC et al, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-03096; Iconix Brand Group Inc et al v Carter et al, American Arbitration Association, No. 01-18-0003-6487; and S. Carter Enterprises LLC et al v Iconix Brand Group Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 653858/2019. — Reuters</p>
