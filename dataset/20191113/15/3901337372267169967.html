        <b>Now that our back four is complete, the midfield positions are in order. In our selection of the Chiskop XI engine room, we’ve combined strength and power with skill, all the ingredients needed in the middle of the park. The midfield pairing we’ve selected can rival some of the best in the world.  </b>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Hlompho Kekana – Chiskop Captain Fantastic</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns captain, Hlompho Kekana, is undoubtedly one of the best and most decorated midfielders in South African football.</p>
      <p>Starting out at Black Leopards in 2006, after making 37 appearances in his first two seasons at the club, SuperSport United snapped up Kekana in 2008. Upon his arrival at Matsatsantsa, he won his first two league titles under Gavin Hunt. </p>
      <p>After two seasons in Pretoria, in addition to a one-season stint at Bloemfontein Celtic in 2010, his big move came in the form of Mamelodi Sundowns in 2011, and he has been an ever-present since. </p>
      <p>Known for his brilliant long passing and shooting ability, he’s also developed an extremely high work-rate, being labelled as a midfield workhorse. </p>
      <p>To date, Kekana has made 409 appearances, with 31 goals and 16 assists.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chiskop achievements</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shortlisted for the 2016 FIFA Puskas Award for his 65-yard goal against Cameroon in an Afcon qualifier.</li>
        <li>Six-time Absa Premiership title winner, twice with SuperSport United and four times with Mamelodi Sundowns, CAF Champions League winner, CAF Super Cup winner, and one-time Telkom Knockout winner.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Chiskop admiration </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jimmy Tau’s thoughts on Kekana in 2018: “I think his skill is his leadership, but his leadership through his own (hard) work.”</li>
        <li>Benni McCarthy’s thoughts on Kekana in 2019: “I have to give credit and a lot of respect to (Hlompho) Kekana. Year in and year out, he produces.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Willard Katsande – Chiskop Hard Man</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tough-tackling defensive midfielder, Willard Katsande, has been a fan-favourite among Kaizer Chiefs supporters for the better part since his arrival in 2011.</p>
      <p>The Chiskop started out at semi-professional clubs in Zimbabwe, including the likes of Frontier Steel and Highway FC. </p>
      <p>In 2009, however, he joined then ZPSL Champions, Gunners FC. By the end of the 2009/10 season, Ajax Cape Town brought Katsande to Mzansi. </p>
      <p>After 15 appearances for the Urban Warriors in 2011, a move to Naturena soon followed. </p>
      <p>During Chiefs’ 2012/13 and 2014/15 title-winning campaigns, he proved to be the driving force behind the club’s success and continues to play a leading role in the current squad.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chiskop interesting facts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Facts from the Kaizer Chiefs official website: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a young boy, Katsande went snake-hunting with his friends. He said that when a python came into his parents’ house, he and his friends tried to kill it, but it was just too big. </li>
        <li>The stylish Chiskop’s favourite brand is Burberry and his favourite cologne is Ermenegildo Zegna. He certainly has expensive taste. </li>
        <li>Katsande’s father, Willard Snr, also played professionally and represented Zimbabwe. </li>
