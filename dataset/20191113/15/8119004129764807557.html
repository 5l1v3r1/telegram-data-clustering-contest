        <b>Police have arrested two employees of the Election Commission's offices in Chattogram in connection with the distribution of counterfeit NIDs to Rohingya refugees.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The arrestees are Abul Khair Bhuiyan, 45, a staffer at the EC's Chattogram district office, and Anwar Hossain, 45, a staffer at the EC's Mirsarai Upazila office.</p>
      <p>They were arrested from their workplaces on Tuesday, said Counter-terrorism and Transnational Unit Inspector Rajesh Barua.</p>
      <p>Law enforcers arrested the two in a case over the NID scam with the Kotwali police and sought 10 days to grill them in custody on Tuesday, said Rajesh.</p>
      <p>Police have arrested 10 people in connection with the forgery so far. The eight other suspects have already been taken into custody for questioning.</p>
      <p>The EC launched its hunt for the scammers after a Rohingya woman was arrested while trying to collect a Bangladeshi passport using a forged NID. The National Identity Registration Department halted the distribution of 50 NIDs to suspected members of the Rohingya community.</p>
      <p>The EC had sold off a few unserviceable computers in 2007-2008 before five laptops went missing from its offices, according to officials. The forgery ring got hold of at least two of those laptops, believe the investigators.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Joynal Abedin, office assistant in Chattogram Regional Election Commission Office last week on charges of including Rohingya refugees in the electoral roll of Coxâ€™s Bazar. One of the missing laptops was also recovered from Joynal.</p>
      <p>Following the tip-off from Joynal, on Thursday police arrested Mostafa Farook, another temporary employee of the EC, who worked as a technical support staff for updating the voter list at the Boalkhali Upazila Election Commission Office. The second laptop was found in his posse</p>
