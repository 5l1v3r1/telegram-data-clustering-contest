      <h1>SEND-Ghana commends government for LEAP programme</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:32:07+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author">Rashid Mbugri, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tamale, Nov. 13, GNA â€“ SEND-Ghana has commended government for the payment of arrears owed beneficiaries on the Livelihoods Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme.</p>
      <p>The organization said this is playing a critical role to restore confidence in the programme and guaranteeing the safety and dignity of the poor and vulnerable citizens.</p>
      <p>It also called on government to ensure timely and regular flow of funds for payment to LEAP beneficiaries in the country.</p>
      <p>This was contained in a press statement issued and signed by Mr Emmanuel Ayifah, Deputy Country Director, SEND-Ghana and copied to the Ghana News Agency in Tamale.</p>
      <p>The statement said the initial delay in the release of funds for the 61st cycle LEAP payment to beneficiaries affected some 30,000 households with over 125,000 beneficiaries in 10 districts across the country during the previous payment cycle in June 2019.</p>
      <p>It said these delays created a situation of discomfort and anxiety amongst beneficiary households, while some social welfare officers who have oversight responsibility over the programme at the district level also suffered some credibility and integrity loss.</p>
      <p>The statement said information gathered during SEND-Ghana's monitoring visits and reports from sections of the media on assessing the coping mechanism adopted by some LEAP beneficiaries, indicate that key demands from beneficiaries is for government to increase the grant size and ensure timely flow of funds.</p>
      <p>The statement called on government to give attention to the demand of citizens especially, those enrolled on the LEAP due to their vulnerability and poverty status.</p>
      <p>The statement said " government should make adequate provisions for social protection expenditure and ensure that such budgetary allocations are disbursed".</p>
      <p>It said "Ghana risks derailing the progress made in her efforts towards defeating poverty and reducing inequalities if we allow needless delays and irregularities in funds disbursement to undermine the impact of poverty reduction interventions such as LEAP".</p>
