      <p>Repairmen working on fixing a burst water main in London had to do a runner when they were attacked - by an angry PIG.</p>
      <p>The raging hog, called Pickle, believed to be a pet, was startled to find engineers in his field earlier today (Weds), and charged them - before protecting the damaged valve.</p>
      <p>Thames Water officials were able to coax the pig away from the valve with a bag of crisps, so both the farm animal and engineers would be safe.</p>
      <p>The pipe burst in Surbiton, southwest London, damaged nearby railway equipment and caused train delays.</p>
      <p>A Thames Water spokesperson said their efforts to reach a valve to cut the water were hindered by "a large pig" which was "acting aggressively".</p>

      <p>They added: "We’re sorry to anyone who has had a longer journey than normal because of the road closure.</p>
      <p>“This is due to a burst on a 48-inch diameter pipe.</p>
      <p>"Our engineers were quickly on site and are working hard to fix the pipe.”</p>
      <p>The spokesperson added there would be no water outages for customers in the area or flooding to properties.</p>
