      <p>Councillors are calling for action to limit the noise from fireworks.</p>
      <p>Members of Torbay Council’s Cabinet heard reports of how random explosions from October to mid-January tormented animals and vulnerable people.</p>
      <p>They supported measures to control fireworks including a call on the Government to limit the noise of those on public sale to 90 decibels - the equivalent of a Boeing 737 passenger jet landing a mile away.</p>
      <p>Cllr Cordelia Law told the meeting fireworks had upset one of her dogs so much he had chewed off some of his fur.</p>
      <p>Another dog who was deaf had been upset by fireworks being let off nearby which were so loud he felt the air vibrate.</p>
      <p>Cllr Jackie Stockman said she had heard that someone had deliberately let off fireworks on a farm gate which caused two terrified cattle to run into a waterway and drown.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think it is hugely important that the size of fireworks that go off like a bomb be reduced.”</p>
      <p>The council’s ruling Cabinet backed a move by Cllr Swithin Long to:</p>
      <p>ask organisers of public firework displays to advertise them in advance, allowing residents to take precautions for animals and vulnerable people;</p>
      <p>support public awareness about the impact of fireworks on animal welfare and vulnerable people – including the precautions that can be taken to mitigate risks;</p>
      <p>write to the UK Government urging it to introduce legislation to limit the maximum noise level of fireworks to 90dB for those sold to the public for private displays; </p>
      <p>encourage local suppliers of fireworks to stock ‘quieter’ fireworks.</p>
      <p>A petition calling for Government to ban the sale of fireworks to the public has attracted more than 300,000 signatures.</p>
      <p>Cllr Long said his own pet dog Robbie was affected by the noise of fireworks and surveys had shown almost half of dogs and a third of cats showed signs of fear.</p>
      <p>His motion said: "Fireworks are used by people throughout the year to mark different events.</p>
      <p>“Whilst they can bring much enjoyment to some people, they can cause significant problems and fear for other people and animals.</p>
      <p> “Vulnerable people can become confused and disorientated by the noise. </p>
      <p>“They can be a source of fear and distress for many animals (including pets, farm livestock and wildlife). </p>
      <p>“Animals affected not only suffer psychological distress but can also cause themselves injuries, sometimes very serious ones, as they attempt to run away or hide from the noise.”</p>
