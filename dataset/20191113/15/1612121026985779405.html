      <p>It’s the end of the year, and that means it’s time to <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/334672-its-your-chance-to-vote-for-the-google-play-users-choice-awards-2018/">vote for your favorite apps and games</a> on the Play Store from 2019. Google has opened up voting for the User Choice awards where everyone will be casting their vote for several different categories of apps and contents.</p>
      <p>There are four categories, including the typical best app, game, movie, and book. You’ll have to select from preset nominees, so you can’t just write anything in, but now’s a great chance to check out some new high-quality apps if there’s anything on the list that you haven’t used before.</p>
      <p>The voting is open until November 25th, and you can change your vote as many times as you want up until that point. Winners will be announced on December 3rd, not long after voting closes.</p>
