      <p>Christmas is coming to Nottingham's <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/national-ice-centre">National Ice Centre</a> and this year there is going to be a supersized festive snow globe ready to jump inside and snap yourself a selfie.</p>
      <p>The inflatable North Pole pop-up will be at the city centre venue for two weekends alongside a giant <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> tree, fairy lights and a magical rink-side grotto, where families can visit Santa.</p>
      <p>Open December 14-15 and 21-22, between 11am – 4pm, the Yuletide activities will also include face painting and crafting.</p>

      <p>Skaters visiting the centre on December 21 can take part in one of three festive foam parties.</p>
      <p>The day will begin with a 'Family Foam' session between 2.45pm and 5pm followed by a 'Relaxed Foam Party' from 5.30pm to 7pm and ending with a special 'Club Night Foam Party' from 7.30pm to 9.30pm.</p>
      <p>The disco lights will be turned on and skaters will be invited to put on their Christmas jumpers and prepare to get festive as cannons spray 'snow' onto the rink whilst skating to all their favourite festive tunes.</p>

      <p>Running all the way through December to Christmas Day is the opportunity to get involved and contribute to the centre's Christmas skating challenge, Laps to Lapland, where skaters attending any public skating session throughout December can help reach the 30,255 laps needed to reach Lapland before Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>The laps equal the 2,015 miles distance between Nottingham and the official home of Santa, Roveniemi in Lapland. Daily progress will be logged and available for everyone to track at national-ice-centre.com/christmas</p>
