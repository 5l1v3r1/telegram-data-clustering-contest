        <i>Heiress and film-maker Abigail Disney has told her fellow baby boomers to sit down, shut up and move on. She’s not the only one</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Name:</b> Boomers for millennials.</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 55-73.</p>
      <p><b>Appearance:</b> Down with the kids.</p>
      <p><b>Which kids?</b> Oh, millennials, generation Z … Anyone younger than 38, basically.</p>
      <p><b>That’s a</b><b>n arbitrary number.</b> Yes, it is. Anyway, you may have noticed there is a war between baby boomers and the younger generations.</p>
      <p><b>I have. Luckily, both sides seem to prefer mouthing off on the internet to </b><b>real fighting.</b> That’s true, so far.</p>
      <p><b>If it does come down to </b><b>armed combat, my money is on the under-38s. </b>Indeed, though they have a powerful new weapon – the dismissive remark “OK boomer”, which has been very effective at annoying older people.</p>
      <p><b>Can’t </b><b>baby </b><b>boomers respond by shaking their fists and shouting “young whippersnapper!” </b>Many have. Thankfully, some peacemakers have emerging to stop things escalating.</p>
      <p><b>Really? Are these the “</b><b>boomers for </b><b>millennials” then? </b>That’s right. The 59-year-old Disney heiress, activist and documentary film-maker Abigail Disney got the ball rolling.</p>
      <p><b>By singing Circle of Life or something? </b>Sadly, no. By issuing a series of passionate tweets on the subject.</p>
      <p><b>Why can’t we all just get along? That kind of thing? </b>Not quite. Addressing her fellow baby boomers, she said, among other things: “You are old. You are not irrelevant yet. But you are less relevant every day.”</p>
      <p><b>That’s, um, empathic. </b>“How about you guys sit down and let the kids drive,” she continued. “It’s not like you’ve done such a great job with the time you have had. Get over the idea that all things pass. You are old and you need to let history do what history does: move on.”</p>
      <p><b>OK. So, less of an attempt at reconciliation. More like a demand for unconditional surrender.</b> Pretty much.</p>
      <p><b>Are many other </b><b>baby </b><b>boomers on her side? </b>Well, the 63-year-old former Tory MP David – now Lord – Willetts wrote a book on the subject a decade ago, in which he argued that his generation had taken more than its share.</p>
      <p><b>Anyone more famous? </b>Fifty-nine-year-old US presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar? She stuck up for millennials, who were supposedly “killing divorce”.</p>
      <p><b>OK.</b> And another US presidential candidate, 70-year-old Elizabeth Warren, wants to forgive up to $50,000 of student debt for the less well off. That would redress the balance a little.</p>
      <p><b>Doesn’t Bernie have an even more generous plan to help the kids?</b> Bernie Sanders is 78, I’m afraid. To him, baby boomers are the kids.</p>
      <p><b>Do say: </b>“Where does generation X stand on this matter?”</p>
      <p><b>Don’t say:</b> “As far away as possible.”</p>
