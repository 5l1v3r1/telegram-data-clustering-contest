      <h1>Fitbit OS 4.1 update brings new sleep and heart tracking features to your wrist</h1>
      <h2>Fitbit smartwatch owners are set for a big boost</h2>

      <p>Owners of <a href="https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/what-fitbit-tracker-should-you-buy">Fitbit smartwatches</a> are set for a big boost, with the company announcing a software update packed with new features for the Fitbit Versa series and Fitbit Ionic.</p>
      <p>In Fitbit OS 4.1, the crop of smartwatches will all receive the long-awaited sleep tracking features first announced alongside the arrival of the Fitbit Versa 2.</p>

      <p>This is headlined by Smart Wake, an alarm which works by waking users with vibrations at a good time in their sleep cycle. The Sleep Score, previously only present in the app, will now also be available directly from the smartwatches.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the heart tracking technology that powers much of these sleep smarts will also be getting a bit of a tweak in the new update.</p>
      <p>Starting with the Versa 2, the PurePulse algorithm will be able to leverage machine learning and recognise the signature of a heart rate in order to deliver improved accuracy.</p>
      <p>It's not the only exclusive feature heading to the Versa 2, either. For those who want more options in the always-on mode, you can now pick between five new faces, and a clock face switcher - which lets you save and pick from five of your favorites - can now also be accessed from the device.</p>
      <p>Even more - Alexa can also be called upon to start workout tracking, while a new Agenda app lets you manage your schedule. If you're running low on battery, the Versa 2 will now be able to jump into a battery saving mode to eke out a few more hours.</p>
      <p>Subscribers of the Fitbit Premium membership plan will see improvements through the new update, as well. A wellness report, third-party workouts, guided programs and challenges will appear over the coming months, the company says.</p>
      <p>However, if you're just a Fitbit smartwatch user - and, particularly, a Fitbit Versa 2 owner - there's plenty to look forward to when OS 4.1 begins rolling out in the first week of December.</p>
