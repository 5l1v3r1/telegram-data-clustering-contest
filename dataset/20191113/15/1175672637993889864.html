      <h1>Heliotrope tucks Collector's Retreat into lush wooded site in coastal Washington</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:00:09+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/jenna-mcknight/" target="_blank">Jenna McKnight</a></address>
      <p>American studio <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/heliotrope/">Heliotrope Architects</a> has created a <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/holiday-homes/">holiday home</a> for art gallery owners that is wrapped in dark metal, punctured with white stucco and large stretches of glass.</p>

      <p>Collector's Retreat is located on a forested site on Orcas Island, which lies just off the coast of northern <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/washington/">Washington</a>. It serves as a second home for a couple who own a Los Angeles gallery that features the work of West Coast artists.</p>
      <p>For their getaway retreat, the clients wanted a cabin that offered both expansive views and space for artwork. They turned to <a href="http://heliotropearchitects.com/">Heliotrope Architects</a>, a firm with offices in Seattle and Portland.</p>

      <p>"They desired a retreat with the feel of a contemporary art gallery, with plenty of wall space to display a rotation of their collection while also capturing expansive views offered by the site," the studio said.</p>
      <p>Envisioned as a "simple box,", the residence totals 1,600 square feet (149 square metres). The single-storey dwelling encompasses a living area and two bedrooms, along with a covered carport adjoined to a studio/utility room.</p>

      <p>Exterior walls are wrapped in black metal panels and white stucco. Windows are framed in black-painted wood to help minimise their visual impact.</p>

      <p>Inside, the team used grey concrete and light-toned finishes such as Carrera <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/marble/">marble</a>. A need to be cost-effective informed the architect's selection of materials – and their design overall.</p>
      <p>"A tight budget was managed through efficient design, simple detailing and a liberal use of IKEA cabinetry," the studio said.</p>

      <p>Inside, the dwelling contains an open-plan public area and two bedroom suites – one for the couple, and one for their grown daughter. Floor-to-ceiling glass provides sweeping vistas of the lush, wooded landscape.</p>
      <p>"The main living space is flanked on either side by the bedroom suites, focusing views in an axial manner toward the water and the wetland forest," the studio said.</p>

      <p>Rooms are adorned with streamlined furnishings and contemporary artwork. In the great room, glazed doors open onto a concrete terrace with a fit pit, which "serves as the primary focus for summer leisure."</p>

      <p>Collector's Retreat is situated within the San Juan Islands, an archipelago in Washington State that is near Seattle and British Columbia. Other projects there include the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/08/04/false-bay-house-olson-kundig-washington/">False Bay House by Olson Kundig</a>, which features pivoting doors and sliding shutters, and the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/24/hillside-sanctuary-hoedemaker-pfeiffer-washington/">Hillside Sanctuary by Hoedemaker Pfeiffer</a>, which is perched on an elevated site overlooking the water.</p>
