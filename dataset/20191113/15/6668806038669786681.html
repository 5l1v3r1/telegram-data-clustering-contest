      <p>Bhumi Pednekar's latest release Bala is doing well at the box-office and she is surely on cloud nine because of that. Apart from being busy with films, the actress has also started a pan India campaign - Climate Warrior, to raise awareness on Environmental Conservation and Global Warming. Climate Warrior is a social media initiative that Bhumi will use to highlight the incredible work done by tireless environmental activists and citizen groups across India. The first Climate Warrior being featured by Bhumi on her platform is the dynamic activist Afroz Shah, a young Indian lawyer from Mumbai, who is synonymous with the world’s largest beach clean-up project in Versova, Mumbai.</p>

      <p>Bhumi and Afroz planned to meet on the Versova beach recently and they discussed the need for beach conservation in India. She also shot the elaborate work put in by Afroz and all the Mumbaikars to keep their beach clean. Of course, Bhumi too participated in the clean-up that lasted over 2 hours.</p>
      <p>Talking about the episode, Bhumi said an official release, “Versova beach clean-up is the largest beach clean-up in the world and I was proud to be a part of the exercise to raise awareness on climate preservation. What I saw has changed my life and I will continue to support Afroz in any and every way possible.”</p>
      <p>The actress shared about it on her Twitter page today. She wrote, “It was my honour, pride and a privilege to have met and join hands with the dynamic lawyer and activist @AfrozShah1, who is synonymous with the world’s largest beach clean-up project in Versova, Mumbai. When he started the Beach Clean Up Project inOctober 2015, it seemed like an impossible, herculean task. Who would’ve thought ONE MAN could clean up an entire 2.5 km beach with over 20 million kgs of trash? With his effort, he started a revolution. He moved people. He inspired lakhs of people to join and participate in the project.He literally moved millions of kilos with the might of sheer human effort. Well, the results are for us all to see and the work hasn’t stopped. He is a true example of what the belief, spirit and determination of one man can do. He is, in the truest sense, a #ClimateWarrior. Let this story inspire you...” Kudos to you!</p>
