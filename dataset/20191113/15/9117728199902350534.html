      <h1>Charles Leclerc: Ferrari's race-pace is "not as bad as it looks"</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> have not won in the last four races, and despite having strong qualifying speed, the Prancing Horse has been unable to turn that into race wins, but <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> has insisted it's not as bad as it seems at the Italian manufacturer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a>' pole position at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, Ferrari's run of six successive poles ended. After winning in Belgium, Italy and Singapore, Ferrari then failed to win the next three races despite having a driver on pole for all three.</p>
      <p>So their qualifying speed does seem a lot quicker than their race-pace, but Leclerc has rejected that Ferrari have problems with their race-pace, and in fact, says they've been unfortunate.</p>

      <p><i>"I believe on my side, I've not been perfect," </i>Leclerc admitted to <i>RaceFans</i><i>. "Especially in the race, I've got a lot of improvements to make on my side. In Mexico, I learned quite a lot. From the outside, it is difficult to see but from the driver's side of things, I tried a lot of things during the race.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We've been unlucky on some races, Sochi could have been another win but we could not control the failure of Seb, which created a Virtual Safety Car. So there have been a few missed opportunities, but I don't think it has been as bad as it looks."</i>
