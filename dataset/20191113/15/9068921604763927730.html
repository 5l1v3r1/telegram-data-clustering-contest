      <h1>Apple Music Gains New 'Replay' Playlist With Your Top Songs Played in 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:31:37+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Juli Clover</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> was today updated with a new feature called Replay, which is designed to allow ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers to take a look at the music that they listened to most in 2019. <br/><br/>Available <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com/replay">on the web</a>, in the Mac Music app, and the Music app on iOS devices, the Replay feature aggregates top songs of the year, while also providing playlists for past years too.</p>

      <p>Playlists are available for every year that an ‌Apple Music‌ subscriber has had the service, dating back to 2015. Replay playlists can be added to the ‌Apple Music‌ Library so they can be streamed right alongside other playlists and shared with others.</p>

      <p>According to <i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/apple-music-introduces-a-replay-a-playlist-of-your-top-songs-of-the-year/">TechCrunch</a></i>, Replay will continue to be updated throughout the year, changing and evolving as a person's musical tastes and interests shift.</p>

      <p>Apple plans to update the Replay playlist each Sunday with new songs and data insights to reflect each person's current listening activity. <br/><br/>‌Apple Music‌ has never offered an aggregated year-end playlist with song data, something that Spotify has provided for years with its Wrapped experience. Apple now has an equivalent feature, and one that is perhaps more useful given the fact that it's updated on an ongoing basis.</p>

      <p>‌Apple Music‌ subscribers can access <a href="https://beta.music.apple.com/replay">Apple Music Replay on the web</a> and add the playlists to iOS or Mac devices. Replay should also be available in the iOS and Mac Music apps without the need to use the feature on the web, but it's still in the early stages of rolling out and not available on every platform yet.</p>
