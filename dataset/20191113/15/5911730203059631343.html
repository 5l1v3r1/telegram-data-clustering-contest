      <p>ISSAQUAH, Wash. – Costco is warning of a scam circulating online.</p>
      <p>The store took to Facebook on Tuesday to clarify that it’s not giving away $75 coupons, despite several posts saying otherwise.</p>
      <p>The store says this isn’t the first time this scam has popped up on social media either.</p>
      <p>“While we love our fans and our members, this offer is a SCAM, and in no way affiliated with Costco,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Costco/posts/10158173746384947?__xts__[0]=68.ARA2VGj5L3IKm-lBrTIn8oNWtVzlmpnLJbsIPY0M1dzwB76PDiB73WiUMaJBtFjmMUAuEA63ID_vSx7rw2Lv-Nyf7kRA7yguSWIBPVDHYRjFmXZEFTTmHEJ4wWHO311A5OITAzkP-YPIuoST1O_uPKA8uV29WAvUpR13hdLCCVC090IahAiic65FRXRcYZI0dLyvUnoB7Gj_boYVj3CFgnlAmZnL8WVhaIDeBiW5a_LdLpwXPIhW9P9fPPIBeSoyR6kCaYsf1dOMOuYD7uHsSpeVl1_IsQRFrbgWOjui-e70YWMhcuFvZdkg3aAaCv1_4kE7ohIJek3Whg&amp;__tn__=-R">wrote Costco.</a> “Thanks to our fans for letting us know about this recurring hoax!”</p>
      <p>The scam in question claimed to offer free $75 Costco coupons in honor of the company’s anniversary. Users were instructed to click particular links, which brought people to web pages not operated or sponsored by Costco, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/costco-coupon-scam/">according to Snopes.com</a> .</p>
      <p>Users were then reportedly encouraged to spread the scam further by sharing the pages and writing “thank you” in the comment field. After that, Snopes says people were asked to input a fair amount of personal information.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/20678-scam-alert-think-twice-before-buying-from-these-social-media-ads">Better Business Bureau</a> offers these tips to protest yourself from social media scams:</p>
      <p>· <b>Do your research.</b> Before making a purchase, do a quick search for the business in question. Do they have valid contact information? Don’t be fooled by professional photography or consumer reviews on their website. These can be lifted from other sites. Check BBB Scam Tracker to see if others have been duped ( <a href="https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/us">org/ScamTracker</a> ).</p>
      <p>· <b>Search for previous complaints.</b> Do a Google search of the business name followed by “complaints”, “reviews”, or “scam” and see what pops up. If you find other people have been cheated by this business, steer clear<br/>· <b>Use good judgment.</b> Many con artists play on consumers’ desire to help those in need. Keep this in mind and use your head, not just your heart, when supporting charitable causes. Go to <a href="https://www.give.org/">Give.org</a> to research organizations before giving.</p>
