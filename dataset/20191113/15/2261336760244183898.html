      <p>Adesanya (18-0) recently appeared on Joe Rogan’s <i>The Joe Rogan Experience</i> podcast. Rogan brought up Shahbazyan’s (11-0) win over Brad Tavares (17-6). “Stylebender” admitted he was not too familiar with Shahbazyan prior to his <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/2/20945612/ufc-244-espn2-prelims-results-video-anderson-runs-through-walker-shahbazyan-head-kicks-tavares-mma">thunderous first-round finish of Tavares</a> at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>“I saw his fight,” Adesanya told Rogan. “He hit Brad Tavares with the head-kick and that kind of caught my attention like, ‘oh s—t, who is this kid?’”</p>
      <p>“He’s at 185, he’s 21. He’s on the come up. I played with Brad for five rounds, he starched him in one round. I’m not taking that lightly. I look at that kid,” Adesanya continued. “Eventually, when that kid comes up, I’m sure I’ll see him at some point. I need to get back to work. Don’t get me wrong I’m working. But you know that FOMO [Fear Of Missing Out].”</p>

      <p>In the meantime, Adesanya is <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20958887/ufc-israel-adesanya-holding-up-yoel-romero-fight-wont-sell-mma-news">angling for a UFC middleweight title defense against Yoel Romero</a>. The potential match-up comes in light of an injury suffered by top contender Paulo Costa. Shahbazyan, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.ufc.com/rankings">ranked number 10</a> in the division and poised for a big fight.</p>
