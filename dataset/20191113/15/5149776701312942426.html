      <h2>An investigation is now taking place</h2>

      <p>A teacher has been suspended after posting the contents of an explicit email intended for their partner on a classroom smartboard.</p>
      <p>West Nottinghamshire College in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Mansfield</a> has suspended the teacher while an investigation takes place.</p>
      <p>Andrew Cropley, principal and chief executive of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">West Nottinghamshire College</a>, said: "I can confirm an incident took place in an A-level sociology class whereby a private email from a tutor, containing explicit content intended for another adult, believed to be his partner, was inadvertently displayed on a smartboard and seen by students.</p>
      <p>"The college acted swiftly by immediately suspending the tutor, pending the outcome of an investigation.</p>
      <p>"Clearly, this was wholly inappropriate conduct that fell significantly below the high professional standards expected of all our staff.</p>
      <p>"I have written to the students and their parents and guardians to offer my sincerest and unreserved apologies."</p>
      <p>"However, although deeply regrettable, it is important to stress this was an isolated incident that in no way reflects the behaviour, conduct and care exercised by our teaching staff day in, day out."</p>
