      <p>If you didn’t catch the message from Shawn Mendes <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/taylor-swift-lover-remix-featuring-shawn-mendes-listen.html">hopping on Taylor Swift’s remix of a little song called “Lover”</a> today, Camila Cabello’s here to reiterate: They’re in love, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/are-shawn-mendes-and-camila-cabello-dating-or-just-friends.html">like for real</a>. The pop singer, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-kissing-instagram.html">messy smoocher</a>, and “Señorita” to Mendes announced that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/camila-cabello-songs-shameless-liar.html">her new album</a>, called <i>Romance </i>(natch), will be out December 6. “I just wanted this album to sound like what falling in love feels like, pretty impossible thing to do but I can say I gave it all I had,” she wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4zhUnZH0xR/?igshid=1o6pehs6oyim3">on Instagram</a>. “I’ve never lived as much life as I did writing this album.” We, meanwhile, are left living vicariously through Cabello and Mendes’s ongoing honeymoon phase. “I hope you love it as much as I’ve loved living it,” she added of the album. Cabello also said she’ll release a new song called “Living Proof” this Friday. Let us guess: Is Mendes the living proof? Of love? Well, congrats to the happy couple, and all those of us on the outside can do is hope we get some good music out of this.</p>
