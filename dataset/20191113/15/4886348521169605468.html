      <h3>Who is Betverse?</h3>
      <p>Developed by Hatchworks and powered by the DALP multi-million dollar liquidity pool, Betverse.io is a unique skills-based (regulated) betting website where users can bet real money on themselves in a range of popular mini, indie, and big-league games and earn as they play, level by level.  It is unique in that users can also challenge their friends with customisable peer-to-peer (P2P) and team betting, or they can bet against the liquidity pool, on reaching certain milestones and levels. It is the world’s first online gaming community where the better you are, the more you earn.</p>

      <p>Led by the global head of business development for Betverse, Karen Yap, the team spent the last 2 weeks in Malaysia (at Level Up KL 2019), Japan, Indonesia and finally, Singapore. As a result, Betverse can announce the following partnerships. </p>

      <p>The developer of Orbiz, the popular zombie survival shooter, shared their (Mr. Made Wira Aditya, CEO of Anoman Studio) concerns about the state of the industry as indie developers continue to struggle across the globe if not picked up by a prominent publisher. Although Orbiz managed to get thousands of paid downloads on Steam, Karen Yap stated “the opportunity to supplement existing ad or DLC based revenue streams through Betverse is monumental.” Orbiz will be integrated into Betverse (mobile version) for in-game betting next year. Anoman Studio will also be providing game development services to Betverse gamers and community members.</p>
