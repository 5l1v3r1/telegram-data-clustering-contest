      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/FredTheGodson/profile">Fred The Godson</a> is getting ready to feed the streets with some new heat. The rapper's been getting ready to release a new project this Friday titled, <i>God's Level</i>. Fred The Godson is bringing it back to the essence of New York hip-hop -- solely beats and bars without anything extra to overshadow his talent. Ahead of its release, he linked up with Benny The Butcher and 38 Spesh for a brand new record titled, "Nokia." Bringing it back to the days before smartphones, Fred raps, "New iPhone, love how they made it/ If I spoke to ya, it was on a Nokia, that was my favorite."</p>
      <p>Fred already dropped off a few tracks off of the project such as "Better Now" ft. <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/JimJones/profile">Jim Jones</a> and Marc Scibilia, and "Retaliation." Including "Nokia," all of his singles so far have been very promising. Peep the new song below.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>I learned from dealers, get 'em back, then you kill 'em slow<br/>I burnt my bridges, took my scraps, and then built a boat<br/>I'm earning digits, all my bitches know<br/>I fly her anywhere as long as she not too bougie to sit in coach</p>
