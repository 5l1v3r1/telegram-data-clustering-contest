      <p>FACEBOOK has removed a 'paedophile-hunting' page used to brand a Co Down man a child sex offender, the High Court has heard.</p>
      <p>The step was taken because the social media giant found it breached its community standards.</p>
      <p>The man, who cannot be identified, was named in a series of online posts and allegedly subjected to a "sting operation" where a group confronted him at his home.</p>
      <p>Referred to as R, he is suing Facebook and the suspected operator of the page 'Not One Nonce Can Escape' (Nonce).</p>
      <p>According to his lawyers, he was accused of being a paedophile in a number of posts accompanied by images and videos about him.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month a group of people were said to have turned up at his family home.</p>
      <p>Disturbances in the street involved neighbours being told R is a paedophile and that they should watch their children, it was claimed.</p>
      <p>He was arrested by police called to the scene, but later released on bail without charge.</p>
      <p>The man obtained an injunction to stop any further material about him appearing on the social media network.</p>
      <p>At a further review the court was on Wednesday told that three postings have been taken down.</p>
      <p>Counsel for the company, Peter Hopkins, also disclosed: "In the course of removing those specific posts Facebook came to the conclusion that the page as a whole was in breach of its community standards and has removed the page.</p>
      <p>"The page is down and the content is down."</p>
      <p>Sean Mullan, representing R, described the firm's response as helpful, but expressed concern that further comments about his client may have appeared on other "mirrored" pages.</p>
      <p>Adjourning proceedings, Mrs Justice Keegan warned the suspected operator of the Nonce page that he remains subject to the injunction.</p>
      <p>"If it's the case that (he) is behind any subsequent pages that poses a difficulty for him, we would bring the matter back and he would be in contempt of court."</p>
      <p>Lawyers for R are seeking damages from that man and Facebook for its allegedly inadequate reporting mechanism.</p>
      <p>Outside court his solicitor, Ciaran Moynagh of Phoenix Law, said: "My client is relieved the page is down and details about him cannot be further disseminated.</p>
      <p>"However, he also feels the damage has been done, and will be pursuing a claim because the information alleging he is a sex offender remained live for a considerably period of time."</p>
