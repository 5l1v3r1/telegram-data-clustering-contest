      <h1>Thousands of Brits fall for fake Morrisons page trying to steal their details</h1>
      <h2>The fake page is promising free £50 vouchers and thousands of Brits are sharing it on Facebook - but it is nothing to do with Morrisons and the supermarket is warning customers to steer clear</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:54:10+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Paige Freshwater, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>A fake Facebook page pretending to be the supermarket Morrisons has been shared by thousands of Brits on social media.</p>
      <p>The convincing page - calling itself "Morrisons UK" - promises people vouchers if they like and share it.</p>
      <p>"We're informing every customer that, To celebrate our anniversary, Each person who shares &amp; Comment below will receive FREE £50 Voucher from us," the fake page reads.</p>
      <p>It then asks people to validate their entry on a separate website.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, it's had almost 7,000 shares while more than 2,500 people currently like it.</p>
      <p>But it's nothing to do with the actual supermarket Morrisons - whose <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Morrisons/">real Facebook page</a> doesn't have "UK" on the end and does have a blue tick to show it's verified.</p>
      <p>"This is a scam nothing to do with Morrisons," the supermarket said <a href="https://twitter.com/Morrisons/status/1194543187899174913">when asked about the fake page on Twitter</a>.</p>

      <p>Some <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> users have taken matters into their own hands, replying to people who appear to be taken in by the fake page.</p>
      <p>Some posted flashing messages reading "Fraud alert" while others have been more blunt - letting people who have shared the message know they're promoting scammers.</p>
      <p>In the past, Morrisons has made its position on voucher giveaways very clear.</p>
      <p>"We would never ask for your personal details in order to redeem a voucher," it said talking about a past scam.</p>
