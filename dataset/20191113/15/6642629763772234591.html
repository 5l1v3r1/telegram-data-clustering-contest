      <p>A piece of skin about the size of a thumbnail can be printed in less than a minute, scientists in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/singapore.html">Singapore</a> have said - a game-changing step for the future of non-animal testing for cosmetics and other products.</p>
      <p>Made up of skin cells from donors and collagen, the in-vitro skin has the same chemical and biological properties as human skin, said John Koh, lab manager at start-up DeNova Sciences, which is collaborating with Singapore's Nanyang Technological University on the product.</p>
      <p>"We can see that the industry is moving towards animal-free testing," Koh said. "So we really want to offer a solution to testing on the skin without using animal or human skin."</p>
      <p>The team has accelerated the manufacturing process by using a printing machine to put in precisely-patterned layers that mimic human skin.</p>
      <p>Each tiny piece of skin takes less than a minute to print, which is the distinctive quality of this project.</p>
      <p>The mixture is then incubated for about two weeks, as the skin cells multiply and gain opacity, turning into a whitish membrane.</p>
      <p>The skin can be used to test the toxicity or irritation potential of a substance, and the penetrative qualities of active ingredients in products like cosmetics.</p>
      <p>Koh's team is now focusing on developing skin that includes Asian pigment cells to test the whitening effects of cosmetics and skincare products.</p>
