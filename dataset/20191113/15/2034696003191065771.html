      <p>‘Fear Inoculum’, the band’s first album in 13 years, was described by <i>NME</i>‘s James McMahon as “a languid and blissful work – one that will richly reward future listens” in <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/tool-fear-inoculum-review">a five-star review</a>.</p>
      <p>“As with releases previous, there are wrinkles that will only emerge after the record is lived with and absorbed. But if you’re wondering whether ‘Fear Inoculum’ was worth the wait, then the answer is yes. If you’re wondering whether it’ll touch your heart, soul and spirt, the answer is also so.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, drummer Danny Carey recently said the band <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/tool-tons-material-new-album-says-drummer-danny-carey-2549528">have “tons of material” for a new album</a>.</p>
      <p>“We have tons of material. It’s not going to take 12 years, or if it does, I’ll probably be so old I probably can’t pick up my sticks any more! But my hope is we’ll do another record and just keep moving forward,” he said.</p>
      <p>The band’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/tool-new-album-release-date2439231-2439231">frontman Maynard James Keenan has previously blamed</a> the long gap between Tool albums on his bandmates’ indecisiveness.</p>
      <p>Speaking last year, he said: “I like to release records and write things a little more quickly than those guys like to write. Their process is very analytical.”</p>
