      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:27:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is following Sir Matt Busby's blueprint as he plots Manchester United's route back to the top.</p>
      <p>Legendary formed United boss Sir Matt championed young players with the famous 'Busby Babes', his crowning glory coming with the club's first European Cup triumph in 1968.</p>
      <p>Current boss Solskjaer is following the same philosophy, according to assistant manager and former United midfielder Mike Phelan, who also worked as Sir Alex Ferguson's No.2 at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's United side that beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> 3-1 on Sunday was the youngest the Premier League has seen this season, with an average age of 23 years and 350 days.</p>

      <p>United boss Solskjaer has put his faith in young players like Marcus Rashford, 22, Anthony Martial, 23, Scott McTominay, 22, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, 21, Andreas Pereira, 23, Mason Greenwood, 18, and Brandon Williams, 19.</p>
      <p>Phelan, speaking at the premiere of new film Busby, which charts the extraordinary life of Sir Matt, said Solskjaer is following the legacy of Sir Matt and Sir Alex, with his commitment to youth.</p>
      <p>“Whether you're young or more senior, then you understand certain things and understand that Sir Matt Busby was really the instigator of what we're seeing now at the football club,” said Phelan.</p>
      <p>“Sir Alex himself would say that he carried on certain traditions, but put his own little brand and style on it, and I think, going forward, that's what Ole will try and do as well."</p>

      <p>Phelan, who played for United between 1989 and 1994, and who is now in his second coaching spell there, said it is vital the young players understand the club's history and heritage.</p>
      <p>“I think they're shown quite a bit when they're in the academy system,” said Phelan.</p>
      <p>“I think the academy do follow those traditions and they do tell them a lot about the history of the football club.</p>
      <p>“When you get more senior players into the club, I think they quickly pick up the baton, really, because it surrounds them every day.</p>
      <p>“They understand what that red shirt means to them, what wearing that badge means to them, and they buy into the history and the tradition pretty quickly.”</p>
      <p>Phelan, 57, said Sir Matt and Sir Alex shared the same outlook as managers, with a desire to entertain fans with fast, attacking football at the core of their philosophy.</p>

      <p>“The eras are different, but they embraced the same thing, and that was the sport itself, the game of football, and the enjoyment a game of football can bring to so many people,” Phelan told the BBC.</p>
      <p>“To me, Sir Matt means someone who followed the tradition of a great football club. I met Sir Matt when I first joined as a player.</p>
      <p>“He had a small office at the ground, he was always welcoming and always had something to say to you. It was a privilege to have known him for that short period of time.”</p>
