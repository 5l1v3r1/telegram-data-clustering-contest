      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday said it was “gravely disappointed” with South Sudan’s failure to form a unity government by a Nov. 12 deadline and would “reevaluate” its relationship with the African nation’s government.</p>
      <p>“We will work bilaterally and with the international community to take action against all those impeding South Sudan’s peace process,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement, adding that the United States would also seek “to establish a new paradigm to achieve peace and a successful political transition in South Sudan” with others in the region.</p>
