      <p>The press release explained that many stroke survivors needed medication and other facilities to keep them alive but the cost involved was huge.</p>
      <p>The release explained that stroke may be caused by a blocked artery or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel resulting in damage to the blood cells or killing the cells.</p>
      <p>The release said stroke could kill and that even survivors often endured a lot of impairment in movement, speech and other senses of the body.</p>
      <p>The released said as part of ways to raise awareness, the association led by the East Legon Executive Fitness Club organized a walk through the principal streets of Accra.</p>
      <p>The association assured that it would continue to offer support through the Community Life After Stroke Programme(CLASP)and the Reintegration for Persons Living With Stroke of which the second phase would take place in the Volta Region and would be replicated across the country.</p>
