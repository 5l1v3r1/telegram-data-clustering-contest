      <h2>Netflix's The Crown has some brilliant UK filming locations from manor houses to picturesque estates you can visit - we take a look at the filming spots used in all three series</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:56:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>Netflix's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-crown">The Crown</a> is back for a third season, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/olivia-colman">Olivia Colman</a> taking the reins from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/claire-foy">Claire Foy</a> to portray the Queen, and Tobias Menzies taking over from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/matt-smith">Matt Smith</a> as Prince Philip.</p>
      <p>As well as the gripping drama on screen, the show offers up seriously breathtaking filming locations from opulent palaces to picture-perfect gardens and awe-inspiring landmarks.</p>
      <p>The best part is that the show is filmed on location in the UK, meaning you can go and see most of them for yourself.</p>
      <p>It's not actually filmed in Buckingham Palace - the real Queen lives there after all - but the manor houses and British estates are just as spectacular.</p>
      <p>New locations for season three include De Vere Horsley Estate, while previous locations feature including Hatfield House, Knebworth House and Belvoir Cathedral.</p>
      <p>We take a look at The Crown's filming locations across the UK from all three series so far...</p>
      <p>Oh, and for more royal-inspired days out, you can also <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/inside-queens-royal-residences-uk-13689754">visit the Queen's royal residences</a> throughout the year.</p>
      <h3>1. Lancaster House</h3>
      <p>While a lot of the series takes place in Buckingham Palace, the cast and crew have previously used Lancaster House to double up as the iconic landmark.</p>
      <p>With its lavish interiors and grandiose state rooms it's a fitting alternative (not to mention it's just further down London's Pall Mall).</p>
      <p>Other spots included the 16th century <b>Wilton House</b> in Wiltshire, as well as <b>Knebworth House</b> in Stevenage.</p>

      <h3>2. Hatfield House, Hertfordshire</h3>
      <p>Hatfield House has served as a filming location across all three seasons.</p>
      <p>The Jacobean stately home boasts opulent halls and rooms so it's the perfect setting for recreating lavish palace interiors (it also served as a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/favourite-filmed-inside-uk-locations-13935474">filming location for The Favourite</a>).</p>
      <p>It boasts plenty of royal links - Elizabeth I was told her of her ascension to the throne.</p>
      <p>Hatfield House is open to the public from April through to September. 2019 prices included adult tickets from £19 and child tickets from £9. You can find out more on the <a href="https://www.hatfield-house.co.uk/your-visit/opening-times-prices/">Hatfield House website</a>.</p>

      <h3>3. De Vere Horsley Estate</h3>
      <p>The estate's mansion house, Horsley Towers, served as a filming location for the third season of The Crown, where it played the role of German Marburg Castle in Hesse.</p>
      <p>The 19th century mansion underwent a multi-million pound renovation which includes updates to the bedrooms, suites and communal areas, while spaces such as the iconic Great Hall were restored.</p>
      <p>Nowadays it's actually a hotel with <a href="https://www.devere.com/Horsley-Estate/">prices from £139 per night</a> on a bed and breakfast basis.</p>

      <h3>4. Ely Cathedral, Cambridgeshire</h3>
      <p>While the Queen and Prince Philip tied the knot at Westminster Abbey, the crew weren't able to film inside the iconic church for season one - so they recreated the wedding at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.co.uk%2FAttraction_Review-g186226-d213701-Reviews-Ely_Cathedral-Ely_Cambridgeshire_England.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fuk-ireland%2Fthe-crown-filming-location-netflix-11675573">Ely Cathedral</a> in Cambridgeshire instead.</p>
      <p>It's no surprise that the cathedral caught the production team's eye. Built as an abbey church, the present building dates back to 1803 and boasts seriously spectacular architecture, not to mention the jaw-dropping interiors.</p>

      <h3>5. Greenwich Naval College, London</h3>
      <p>Located in London's picturesque Greenwich district, the Naval College served as a stand in for Buckingham Palace's courtyard.</p>
      <p>In fact, a specially-built portico was attached to the building to add to its resemblance to the palace.</p>
      <p>It's free to go an explore the college and its historic grounds (open daily), but some tours can incur an extra fee. <a href="https://www.ornc.org/visit">Find out more on its website here</a> .</p>

      <h3>6. Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire</h3>
      <p>Belvoir Castle has doubled up as Windsor Castle in all three series of the Crown, with its Elizabeth Saloon and the Regent's Gallery serving as filming locations.</p>
      <p>For the third season, the cast and crew spent over a month filming both interior scenes as well as exterior shots on the castle's picture-perfect grounds.</p>
