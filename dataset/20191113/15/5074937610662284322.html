      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA – Government has proposed to use GH¢85.9 billion as Total Expenditure for the 2020 fiscal year, which is 21.6 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including arrears payment, Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, the Finance Minister, said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Delivering the 2020 Budget Statement and Economic Policy for the Government in Parliament, Mr Ofori-Atta said the Government had projected to raise GH¢67.1 billion, which is up from the projected outrun for 2019 of GH¢54.6 billion.</p>
      <p>He said wages and salaries for next year are projected at GH¢22.9 billion and constituted 26.7 per cent of the Total Expenditure, including arrears clearance, adding that goods and services are also projected at GH¢8.3 billion, which is 2.1 per cent of GDP and 9.7 per cent of the Total Expenditure (including arrears clearance).</p>
      <p>The Minister said interest payments on public debt was projected at GH¢21.7 billion, which was 5.4 per cent of GDP.</p>
      <p>Domestic Revenue to be raised in 2020 is estimated at GH¢65.8 billion, representing an annual growth of 22.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Grants disbursement from Development Partners is estimated at GH¢1.2 billion, which is 0.3 per cent of GDP and a nominal growth of 48.8 per cent.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori-Atta said the Government would continue with the implementation of the Earmarked Funds Capping and Realignment Act to reduce budget rigidities and create fiscal space to fund growth-enhancing expenditures.</p>
      <p>He said transfers to Statutory Funds and all other earmarked funds were estimated at GH¢15.6 billion in 2020, representing 19.6 per cent growth over the projected outturn for 2019.</p>
      <p>Capital Expenditure is projected at GH¢9.3 billion, which is 2.3 per cent of GDP, representing 53.5 per cent increase over the 2019 projected outturn.</p>
      <p>Of this amount, the Minister said Domestic Financed Capital Expenditure is estimated at GH¢3.8 billion (0.9 per cent of GDP), while Foreign Financed Capital Expenditure is estimated at GH¢5.5 billion (1.4 per cent of GDP), to be funded by a combination of Project Grants and Loans.</p>
      <p>He said based on the estimates for Total Revenue and &amp; Grants and Total Expenditure, the 2020 fiscal operations will result in a cash deficit of GH¢18.9 billion, equivalent to 4.7 percent of GDP.</p>
      <p>Financing of the Fiscal Deficit from domestic sources would amount to GH¢8.3 billion (2.0 per cent of GDP), while foreign financing of the deficit would amount to GH¢10.6 billion (2.7 per cent of GDP).</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori-Atta said the foreign financing of the deficit would also include a planned international capital market programme to raise up to three billion dollars, of which 2.0 billion dollars would support the implementation of the 2020 Budget and for domestic liability management.</p>
