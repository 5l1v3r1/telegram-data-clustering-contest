      <h1>Oyo Governorship Election: Adelabu vows to approach Supreme Court...</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:12:11+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/362716-oyo-governorship-election-adelabu-vows-to-approach-supreme-court-over-appeal-court-judgement.html" target="_blank">Atanda Adebayo</a></address>
      <p>The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the March 9 governorship election in Oyo State, Adebayo Adelabu, says he will approach the Supreme Court with his petition against the victory of Governor Seyi Makinde of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p>
      <p>Mr Adelabu was reacting to Monday’s judgement of the Appeal Court which set aside the nullification of the petition by the tribunal.</p>
      <p>The election petition tribunal had in September dismissed the petition.</p>
      <p>However, the Court of Appeal in Ibadan on Monday set aside the tribunal judgement.</p>
      <p>The APC candidate said the pronouncement by the Appeal Court has rekindled his hope in the electoral and judicial processes.</p>
      <p>Mr Adelabu, in a statement he signed and made available to Premium Times on Wednesday, said he approached the judiciary because he believed he was robbed of victory in the election.</p>

      <p>“It is on record that we ran the most organised and issue-driven campaign and our people, having been convinced of our ability to walk the talk, freely gave me their mandate in the election.</p>
      <p>“However, the agents of darkness perfected the plan to steal this mandate, hence our recourse to the judiciary to prove their wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>“Now that the Appeal Court has set the tone of righting the wrong, I appeal to the good people of Oyo State to hold the peace and go about their lawful activities as we approach the Supreme Court to validate your victory.</p>
      <p>“After the darkness, no matter how long it takes, comes sunshine. Victory is certain for us and the mass of the people of our state,” Mr Adelabu said.</p>
