      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said he would stand down no more candidates beyond the 317 Conservative seats his party has already withdrawn from.</p>
      <p>When asked if he would stand down any further candidates, he said he would not.</p>
      <p>“No. That’s just a sort of attempt at intimidation that has come from elements of the press. No. We are going to take on all the remainers who are standing in this country.”</p>
      <p>Farage said he would take on Labour and remainer parties in the election.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to stand against every single one of them,” Farage said of the Labour Party.</p>
