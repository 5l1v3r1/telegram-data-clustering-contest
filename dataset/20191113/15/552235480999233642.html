      <h2>Social media ‘cleanfluencer’ Mrs Hinch released the interactive book last month and it quickly topped the charts in stores and online</h2>

      <p>Essex hairdresser <a href="https://amzn.to/32GnZsw">Mrs Hinch</a> has single-handedly persuaded a nation to karate chop their cushions, store their spare cleaning products in a cupboard called Narnia and refer to housework as “Hinching”.</p>
      <p>She names her sponges, dusters and household appliances and updates her 2.9 million Instagram followers on what she and Kermit have been up to.</p>
      <p>Stores have been quick to leap on her bandwagon, with her beloved Home Bargains grouping a selection of her favourite Zoflora disinfectant and Vanish carpet spray in a special ‘Hinch’ corner.</p>
      <p>Her book, <a href="https://amzn.to/32GnZsw">Mrs Hinch: The Activity Journal</a> , was released last month and instantly became a number one bestseller, topping the charts in stores and online.</p>
