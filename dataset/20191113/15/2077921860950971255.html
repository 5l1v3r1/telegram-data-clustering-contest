      <h1>Watch Lady Lamb Play Songs from Even in the Tremor in the Paste Studio</h1>

      <p>Lady Lamb (the New Hampshire-born, Brooklyn-based Aly Spaltro) stopped by the <i>Paste</i> Studio in Atlanta on Wednesday following a show with New Pornographers on Tuesday night. Spaltro and her band are currently touring behind the fourth Lady Lamb LP, <i>Even in the Tremor</i>, which arrived in April on Ba Da Bing Records. Watch the session below.</p>
      <p>Spaltro performed three songs from the record: “Little Flaws,” “Deep Love” and the title track. She has a very affecting voice that fills the whole room, especially when belting loud but introspective lyrics like “The future kills the present if I let it,” which she repeats during the powerful title track. The album is thoughtful yet concise, packed with restless indie rock songs that occasionally toy with synths and soul.</p>
      <p>Playing alongside Spaltro were bassist Jeni Magana, drummer Derek Gierhan and keyboardist Katie Von Schleicher, who <i>Paste </i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/katie-von-schleicher-the-best-of-whats-next-1.html">named</a> The Best of What’s Next in 2017.</p>
      <p>Again, you can watch Lady Lamb’s new <i>Paste</i> Studio session below. Further down, check out her performance of “Salt” in the NYC outpost in 2017.</p>
