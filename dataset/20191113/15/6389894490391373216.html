      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has said it “would have been the right thing” to arrest Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi rather than kill him.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader, who is currently campaigning in Scotland, told reporters that al-Baghdadi “being removed from the scene is a very good thing”.</p>
      <p>But he questioned whether it was necessary to kill the terrorist leader.</p>

      <p>“If it would have been possible to arrest him – I don’t know the details of the circumstances at the time, I’ve only seen various statements put out by the US about it – surely that would have been the right thing to do,” Corbyn said.</p>
      <p>“If we want to live in a world of peace and justice, we should practice it as well.”</p>
      <p>Bemoaning the impact of wars, human rights abuses and climate change on global “insecurity”, Corbyn added: “I want to lead a government that’s serious about human rights abuses around the world, that won’t be selling arms to Saudi Arabia and will support the continuation of the Iran nuclear deal.”</p>
      <p>Al-Baghdadi, the leader of Isis, was killed last month after he detonated a suicide vest during a raid conducted by US military.</p>
      <p>During his visit to Glasgow today, the Labour leader was heckled by a Church of Scotland minister who called him a “terrorist sympathiser”, and asked why he wasn’t wearing an “Islamic jihad scarf”.</p>
      <p>Revd Richard Cameron also asked “who’s going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you’re Prime Minister”.</p>
      <p>A Church of Scotland spokesperson said the organisation “has a long history of engaging with politicians through a number of channels.</p>
      <p>“While we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured, and allows for reasoned debate.”</p>
