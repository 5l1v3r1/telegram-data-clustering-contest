      <p>This writer understands that efforts are underway for KTN to air the story on the identity of the eight individuals as shared by the Rwandan authorities in its 7PM and 9PM news bulletins without identifying Erickson as its employee. This is in a bid to protect the Standard Group’s image.</p>
