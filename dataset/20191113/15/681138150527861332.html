      <p>Businessman Tony Love said he was angered by the decision announced by party leader Nigel Farage on Monday - and would still be putting his name forward as an Independent Brexit candidate in the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>He said: "We've already been campaigning hard and we're getting some good reactions from voters - and then we suddenly heard the campaign was being pulled!</p>
      <p>"This constituency voted to leave the EU - but all the other candidates voted to Remain in 2016. If I don't stand, who is going to represent those people who want to leave?</p>
      <p>"We're hearing about a deal - but a lot of us don't think that is really Brexit. We have a shop in Felixstowe and that has been very popular."</p>

      <p>Mr Love said he would continue to campaign across the constituency - and believed he was the first Brexit Party candidate who had been dropped to confirm that he would stand as an independent.</p>
      <p>The decision to pull the Brexit Party candidates from constituencies won by the Tories two years ago has affected almost every seat in Suffolk and Essex - only Ipswich where Labour's Sandy Martin is hoping to be re-elected is still facing a Brexit Party challenge.</p>
      <p>And there is pressure for the Brexit Party to pull out of Labour/Conservative marginal seats like this in a bid to give the Tories a clear run in the election.</p>
      <p>In Suffolk Coastal the defending Conservative candidate and cabinet minister Dr Therese Coffey said she was not concerned about Mr Love's decision. She is defending a majority of 16,000 over Labour.</p>
      <p>She said: "If he wants to stand, then it's up to him. It really doesn't bother me - we're getting out message out across the constituency.</p>
      <p>"What we're hearing people say is that they want us to get on with leaving the EU with a deal - and that is what the government has negotiated. Voters seem to understand that."</p>
      <p>The other confirmed candidates in the election in Suffolk Coastal - Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Greens are all in favour of either a second referendum on membership of the EU or revoking Article 50 and remaining in the Union.</p>
      <p>Potential candidates have until 4pm on Thursday afternoon to be nominated or withdraw from the election process.</p>
