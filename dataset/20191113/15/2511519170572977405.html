      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/france-football">France</a> boss <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/didier-deschamps">Didier Deschamps</a> insists <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Olivier_Giroud">Olivier Giroud</a> has earned his trust but refused to close the door on Anthony Martial.</p>
      <p>Manchester United's Martial has been left out of the squad to face Moldova and Albania this week.</p>
      <p>Giroud has played just 211 minutes for Chelsea this season, with Tammy Abraham the first-choice striker at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>But, ahead of Thursday's Euro 2020 qualifier with Moldova in Paris, Deschamps has full faith in World Cup winner Giroud.</p>
      <p>"Maybe that means something but it's mostly what happened on the pitch that means something," he told a press conference. "If he is the one I used the most, do not forget either the ratio of matches and goals.</p>
      <p>"There are not many in front of him in terms of goals in the history of the France team. He did the right thing, he answered the trust."</p>
      <p>But Martial remains in the manager's long-term plans. The forward has impressed for United since returning from two months out with a thigh injury, scoring three goals in seven games.</p>
      <p>"He was part of the French team on a regular basis, but recently he was often injured," said Deschamps.</p>
      <p>"He came back not so long ago and it's going well in his role as a central striker with Manchester United. For a long time he's been part of the players likely to be called up."</p>
      <p>France are second in Group H, behind Turkey on goal difference.</p>

      <p>The reigning world champions will qualify for Euro 2020 from Group H if they beat Moldova, or if Iceland fail to win against Turkey.</p>
      <p>Deschamps also expects PSG's Kylian Mbappe to be fit despite the striker missing the 2-1 Ligue 1 win at Brest on Saturday with a muscle problem.</p>
      <p>"Mbappe has not arrived yet, but will be there," he added. "There was communication between the two doctors on the fact it was a precaution.</p>
      <p>"There was no particular concern compared to our Thursday deadline."</p>
      <p>Moldova are bottom of the group, having won one of their eight games.</p>
