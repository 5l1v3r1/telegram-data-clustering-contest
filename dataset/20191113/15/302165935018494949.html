      <p>NOVEMBER 13 — Manchester City’s Portuguese midfielder Bernardo Silva has been suspended for one match and fined £50,000 pounds over a Twitter post concerning French team mate Benjamin Mendy, the Football Association (FA) said today.</p>
      <p>Silva was criticised by anti-racism body Kick It Out after posting a message on Sept. 22 comparing Mendy to a chocolate-covered peanut character used in the logo for Conguitos, a confectionary brand popular in Spain and Portugal, before deleting it.</p>
      <p>“Silva has been suspended for one first team competitive fixture, fined 50,000 pounds and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a breach of FA Rule E3,” the FA said in a <a href="http://www.thefa.com/news/2019/oct/02/bernardo-silva-suspended-131119">statement</a>.</p>
      <p>The governing body of English soccer added that his social media activity had breached FA Rule E3(1) as it was “insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute”.</p>
      <p>It also “constituted an “Aggravated Breach”... as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin”, the FA added.</p>
      <p>Premier League champions Manchester City, who are fourth with 25 points from 12 games and trail leaders Liverpool by nine points, next host third-placed Chelsea on Nov. 23. — Reuters</p>
