      <h1>Rising Ayrshire artist launches first collection after being headhunted by online firm</h1>
      <h2>Prints of Kilwinning's Julian McLaughlan first collection - which sold out in under 15 minutes- are now available to buy online</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:55:53+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Toni Lennox, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/toni-lennox/</a></address>
      <p>Kilwinning artist Julian McLaughlan has launched a range of abstract prints, canvas and pillows ahead of his second exhibition.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old artist teamed up with awesomeart.com to sell prints of his first ever collection depicting the personification of mental health issues.</p>
      <p>And now the painter is hard at work preparing for his next art show in Ayr’s 1517 on Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>Awesomeart - A UK company- was tipped off about Julian’s abstract work by artist Steven Brown.</p>
      <p>Julian said: “It feels amazing knowing that someone has seen my work and thought it’s good enough to push out there.”</p>
      <p>Following his sell out debut show in Glasgow, Julian is now gearing up for his Ayr show. He explained: “This show will exhibit about six pieces, possibly more, some on larger scale.”</p>
      <p>It’s only been two months since the Ayrshire talent’s debut. He added: “It’s been mega stressful.”</p>
      <p>Julian is keeping his cards close to his chest when asked for details about the showcase. But as a friend of Irvine Herald he has given us an exclusive sneak peek at one of the paintings.</p>
