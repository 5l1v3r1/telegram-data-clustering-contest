      <h1>German air force rejects delivery of two Airbus planes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:08:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Germany's air force said Wednesday it had refused delivery of two Airbus A400M transport planes over technical faults, saying bolts holding the propellers on some already operational aircraft were loose.</p>
      <p>"The armed forces have decided not to accept two A400Ms due for delivery," the Luftwaffe (air force) said in a statement, adding that "our soldiers' safety in their daily use of the A400M aircraft is top priority for us."</p>
      <p>Repeated technical problems have dogged the A400M programme, a turboprop transport aircraft developed jointly for Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey.</p>
      <p>Now, routine checks on some of the Luftwaffe's 31 planes have found "not all 24 nuts per propeller had the correct tightening torque," the air force said.</p>
      <p>"If these problems are not identified and corrected, they can cause severe structural damage to the propeller and shaft," it added.</p>
      <p>With each inspection taking around 30 man-hours, the discovery poses "significant challenges" to the 62nd Air Transport Squadron, which operates the A400M.</p>
      <p>Additional checks are needed on the engines, along with the points where motors are attached to the wings, and for cracks in various parts of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe plans to keep flying its existing A400Ms when they are certified as safe.</p>
      <p>"The model has more than proven itself in supplying deployment areas with personnel and equipment, in air-to-air refuelling, in transport home of soldiers needing medical treatment and in humanitarian aid missions," notching up 4,000 flight hours with the air force, it said.</p>
      <p>Airbus said it was aware of the technical problem which it had also communicated to its customers.</p>
      <p>It insisted however that "this is not safety critical and our customers continue to accept and operate their aircraft".</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, pan-European aircraft maker Airbus renegotiated contract terms with the purchasing countries' governments over the huge cost overruns and delays.</p>
      <p>Some 81 A400Ms were in operation by July.</p>
