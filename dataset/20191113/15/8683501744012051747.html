      <p>It's been a series of months since <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> hit theaters, the conversation surrounding The Russo Brothers' massive blockbuster hasn't slowed down. New revelations about the movie's production are revealed weekly, revealing how creative decisions were made on set. The time jump drastically changed the characters who survived Thanos' snap, chief among them being Chris Hemsworth's Thor. And it turns out that fat thor really threw the crew of the movie for a loop.</p>
      <p><i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame</i> were <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466519/yes-the-russo-brothers-regret-filming-infinity-war-and-endgame-back-to-back">filmed back to back</a> in 2017, with The Russo Brothers attempting to facilitate the ensemble cast's schedules. The pair of movie's scripts were kept under wraps, which made for some confusion on set when Chris Hemsworth's Thor showed up <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477047/sean-gunn-got-super-close-to-thors-belly-while-filming-avengers-endgame">in a fat suit</a> and unkept hair. Writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus recently spoke to this dynamic, saying:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Stephen McFeely</b>: So, it basically went Movie 1 and Movie 2 with the big exception of all the Asgard stuff. So that was early in the schedule and that was Movie 2 so that was shot two years ago. It’s always blown my mind that we were using heavy Thor well before the first movie ever came out.<br/><b>Christopher Markus</b>: A good amount of the crew had not read the scripts and so they were like, ‘Wait, why, what happened to Thor?’</blockquote>
      <p>Well, that's delightful. It looks like the tight security at Marvel Studios actually created some confusion when <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> was being shot. The movie's time jump and Thor's physical transformation were plot twists nobody saw coming, including those crew members employed to make <i>Endgame</i> a reality.</p>
      <p>Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus' comments come from the writers' recent appearance on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1485932663">The Hollywood Unscripted</a> podcast alongside The Russo Brothers. It looks like Chris Hemsworth's transformation into Bro Thor happened early in production for <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. But without giving the crew members a heads up about the film's contents, seeing the hulking Avenger's new appearance was unexpected.</p>
      <p>Later in the same conversation, Joe Russo goes on to say that <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483116/taika-waititi-teases-thor-love-and-thunder-will-be-even-crazier-than-ragnarok">hadn't even been shot</a> at the point where Bro Thor made his debut on set. This timing is confusing, as <i>Ragnarok</i> arrived in theaters about six months before <i>Infinity War</i>. Just how Marvel Studios was able to balance all of its projects and characters in Phase Three remains a mystery. But it's a scheduling wonder.</p>

      <p>The efforts ultimately paid off, as <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> became the highest grossing movie of all time, beating out James Cameron's <i>Avatar</i> in the process. And now the massive blockbuster is available to stream on Disney+. You can <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/410947/705874/9358">use this link for a free 7-day trial</a> of the new service, complete with new <i>Endgame</i> deleted scenes.</p>
      <p>Now that Disney+ has been released to the public, Marvel fans can stream both <i>Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame</i>. While the latter is on the new streaming service, <i>Infinity War</i> will be on Netflix until the new year, before making its way to Disney+. Still, it's exciting that those massively successful pair of movies can be available to view on any smart device.</p>
      <p>It should be interesting to see what happens to Thor in Phase Four. The God of Thunder will <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482829/taika-waititi-didnt-have-to-do-much-to-convince-thors-natalie-portman-to-return-for-love-and-thunder">break new ground</a> as the first hero to get a fourth solo movie with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483252/taika-waititi-does-not-seem-pumped-about-thor-4-captain-marvel-and-valkyrie-theory">Taika Waititi's</a> <i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i>. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482510/fat-thor-isnt-confirmed-for-love-and-thunder-yet-according-to-taika-waititi">It's currently unclear</a> when that blockbuster is set, and whether or not Thor will retain his thicker physique. He also left Earth with the Guardians of the Galaxy in <i>Endgame</i>, and plenty of fans are hoping we'll see more of his dynamic with the group.</p>
      <p>The next installment in the MCU is <i>Black Widow</i> on May 1st, 2020.
