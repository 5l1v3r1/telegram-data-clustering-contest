      <p>RIYADH: Houthi militants fired a missile at the Arab coalition’s headquarters in the city of Marib on Wednesday during a visit by the Yemeni defense minister, killing seven Yemeni soldiers and injuring at least 12, local officials said.<br/>The base, in Sahn Al-Gin district, is the main military facility overseeing a ground offensive aimed at recapturing the capital Sanaa, controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi militia since 2014, which lies 120 km (75 miles) to the west of Marib.<br/>There was no immediate confirmation from the Arab coalition fighting to restore the legitimate Yemeni government and who have been battling the Houthis in Yemen for more than four years.<br/>But Saudi-owned news channel Al Arabiya said a high-ranking official was among those killed.<br/>Military sources told Al Arabiya that the “Iran-backed Houthi militia fired two missiles from Jabal Haylan, located about 70 km east of Sanaa.”<br/>Mohammed Al-Maqdishi, the defense minister of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, and Saudi military officers were in the compound at the time, the officials said.<br/>A military official, on condition of anonymity, said the Houthis carried out Wednesday’s attack.<br/>The official told AFP the casualty toll was confirmed by a medic at Marib hospital and included two senior officers.<br/>However, no group claimed responsibility for the attack.<br/>The uptick in violence follows weeks of relative calm in the war between the internationally-recognized government and the Iran-backed Houthi militia.<br/>Separately, Wadah Dobish, a spokesman for the government’s forces, says they repelled an attack by Houthi militants south of the key port city of Hodeida on Tuesday. Dobish says four Houthi fighters were killed.<br/>Last week, Houthi forces fired missiles and drones at the Red Sea port city of Al-Mokha, killing eight people, among them four civilians, and damaging a hospital.<br/><i>(With AP and Reuters)</i></p>
