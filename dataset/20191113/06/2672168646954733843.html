      <p>Residents in Yangon city felt the significant impact of an earthquake that occurred with magnitude 4.1 Richter scale with its epicenter inside Myanmar, about 13 miles southwest of Taikkyi at 9.45 pm on November 12, forcing some tall buildings to tilt slightly.</p>
      <p>According to the observations released by the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology,  a slight earthquake of magnitude 4.1 Richter Scale with its epicenter inside Myanmar about 13 miles southwest of Taikkyi latitude 17.17°N, longitude 95.83°E, depth 10 kilometers, about 30 miles northwest of Kaba-Aye seismological observatory was recorded at 21hr 54 min 31 sec M.S.T on  12th November, 2019.</p>
      <p>"The magnitude was 4.1 Richter scale with its epicenter about 13 miles southwest of Taikkyi. It is 30 miles from the Sagaing fault. The 2017 quake also happened near Taikkyi. As the depth was 10 kilometers, we felt a significant impact," said Dr Kyaw Moe Oo, director general of the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology.</p>
      <p>Seismologist and Member of Parliament Soe Thura Tun, also former vice chairman of Myanmar Earthquake Committee, said last night's quake had nothing to do with the Sagaing fault adding that it might be due to a fault in the west of Bago Yoma.</p>
      <p>"Quakes usually happen in that area. A quake also occurred in Taikkyi in 2017. The latest quake was also significant after the tsunami caused by a quake in 2004 in Yangon," Soe Thura Tun said.</p>
      <p>Initial reports show that in last night's quake, some high buildings in five places of Tamway Township, one in South Okkalapa Township and one in Thingangyun Township were slightly tilted.</p>
      <p>A Facebook account named Myo Khaing posted the news that the diamond orb atop Stupa No. 26 at the Shwedagon Pagoda fell to the ground. But the news could not be confirmed as Aung Myat, a member of the pagoda board of trustees powered off his phone when contacted for the report.</p>
      <p>A resident living in Yankin Township said: "The quake impact was a bit significant tonight. We live on the fifth floor. The glasses containing water offered at the altar in our home were shaking."</p>
      <p>Myanmar is on the list of the countries that are most vulnerable to quakes. The country has five major seismic waves and several faults.</p>
