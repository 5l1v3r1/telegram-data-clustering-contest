      <p>London - <b>Dominic Thiem </b>produced a scintillating display of attacking tennis to beat <b>Novak Djokovic</b> and qualify for the last four at the ATP Finals on Tuesday, leaving the Serbian facing a shootout against <b>Roger Federer</b>.</p>
      <p>In the standout match so far at London's O2 Arena, the Austrian fifth seed took the fight to the world No 2, recovering from losing the first set to triumph 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 7-6 (7/5)</p>
      <p>Earlier, Federer put himself back in the mix at the end-of-season event with a 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 win against Italian debutant Matteo Berrettini in their round-robin clash.</p>
      <p>Federer and Djokovic will face off on Thursday in a repeat of this year's Wimbledon final to determine who else will progress from Group Bjorn Borg.</p>
      <p>Thiem was forced to play high-stakes tennis against the 16-time Grand Slam winner, taking the breath away with some of his inside-out forehands and single-handed backhands</p>
      <p>Forced to play at his limit, he hit 50 winners compared with Djokovic's tally of 27 but also racked up 44 unforced errors.</p>
      <p>"This was really one of these special matches, what I've practised all my life for, all my childhood for," Thiem said.</p>
      <p>"Really epic one in an amazing atmosphere, beating a legend of our game. And also I've qualified for the semi-finals, which is the best.</p>
      <p>"Coming back from 1-4 (down in the deciding tie-break) was a little bit of luck, but it was an unbelievable match and one I'll never forget. Novak is the best player in the world and I had to do something special."</p>
      <p>In a captivating first set the players swapped a break apiece but Djokovic, a five-time ATP Finals champion, edged the tie-break.</p>
      <p>Undaunted, Thiem broke his opponent at the first opportunity in the second set and, with Djokovic's error count climbing, went on to level the match.</p>
      <p>Thiem also drew first blood in the decider but cracked in the sixth game as Djokovic levelled the match and appeared to have engineered a switch in momentum.</p>
      <p>The Austrian successfully challenged at 30-30 in the 10th game after his forehand was ruled out, preventing a match point for Djokovic and he toughed it out to level at 5-5.</p>
      <p>He then broke Djokovic to love to earn a chance to serve for the match but stumbled and the decider went to a tie-break.</p>
      <p>Still the drama was not finished. Thiem slipped to 4-1 down but battled back to win it on his second match point when Djokovic dumped a forehand into the net.</p>

        <b>Federer stays alive</b>
      </p>
      <p>Third seed Federer had put himself under the cosh by losing his opening round-robin match to Thiem.</p>
      <p>The six-time champion was not at his fluent best on Tuesday but ultimately had too much for his Italian opponent.</p>
      <p>The Swiss upped his game to take the first set tie-break comfortably and broke immediately at the start of the second set to leave the big-serving Berrettini with too much to do.</p>
      <p>Federer was asked after his win against Berrettini whether his defeat to Djokovic at Wimbledon had left emotional or mental scars.</p>
      <p>"We'll find out, but I think it's all flushed away from my side," said the Swiss.</p>
      <p>"A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then."</p>
      <p>Djokovic is hunting a sixth ATP Finals title to pull level with Federer's record and is also seeking to pip Rafael Nadal to the year-end number one ranking.</p>
      <p>On Monday, top seed Nadal lost his opener in Group Andre Agassi to defending champion Alexander Zverev while Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Daniil Medvedev.</p>
