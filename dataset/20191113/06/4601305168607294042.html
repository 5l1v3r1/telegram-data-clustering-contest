      <p>Aestetix writes, "Our 13th conference is taking place next summer in a brand new location as you've probably heard. We expect it to be bigger and better than ever with lots more activities and space - all without leaving New York City! Since this is #13, we figured we'd make an initial batch of tickets available on November 13th at precisely 13:13 Eastern Time (that's 1:13 pm for those who don't do 24 hour clocks)."</p>
      <p>It's been a <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/29/muppets-leave-manhattan.html">rocky time</a> for <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/10/07/sorely-missed.html">2600 Magazine</a> and its venerable <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/29/muppets-leave-manhattan.html">Hackers on Planet Earth con</a> -- so unbelievably awesome to see HOPE back in 2020!</p>
