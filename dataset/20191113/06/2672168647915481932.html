      <p>There is no reason to negotiate with the Arakan Army (AA) about detainee exchange, said Brig-Gen Zaw Min Tun, Secretary of Tatmadaw True News Information Team.</p>
      <p>On November 11, the AA issued a statement saying that it wants to exchange the victims detained by the AA with the civilians arrested by the Tatmadaw.</p>
      <p>“There is no state army in the world which negotiates with terrorists. I think there is no reason to negotiate about terrorist acts,” he added.</p>
      <p>“There is the definition of “prisoner of war”, which is being used in the world. The word “prisoner of war” is a person who is captured and held during war . Take a look at Shwenadi incident, the AA abducted the people in a cowardly manner. This is not war. The AA abducted them in a terrorist manner.”</p>
      <p>“The Tatmadaw is carrying out arrests and interrogation of people in accordance with the law. The Tatmadaw does not take action against them after interrogation and the cases are sent to the court. It depends on the court’s decision. The Tatmadaw did not complain about the court’s decision. For instance, a corporal from the Military Intelligence was shot dead in Sittwe. The case was sent to the court with strong evidences. But the court did not bring charge against the suspects as the evidences were invalid. The Tatmadaw cannot penalize them. The court will make decision.”</p>
      <p>The AA issued a statement saying that all hostages died as the vessel capsized due to the attacks by Tatmadaw’s helicopter. Some media made an interview with the escapees rescued by Tatmadaw helicopter. The  escapees’ words are not synonymous with the facts included in the AA’s statement, he continued.</p>
      <p>There is no consistency in their statement. For instance, the AA arrested the fire brigade members. In its statement, the AA said the hostages are in good health. The AA said on the day when the hostages were released, a fire brigade member died while drinking water. The AA has led the list of the most despicable and dishonest insurgents. The rest can be recognized as the EAOs, he continued.</p>
      <p>The AA is an armed organization which makes discussions with the government to sign the ceasefire agreement.  Ongoing fights are taking place between the AA and the Tatmadaw in Rakhine State.</p>
