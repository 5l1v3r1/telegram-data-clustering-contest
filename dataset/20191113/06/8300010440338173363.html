      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Nineteen-year-old Ana Lua Martel has grown up in the middle of heated immigration debate.<br/><br/>"I was born in Mexico in the state of Jalisco. At the age of four, we decided to come the United States, more specifically Arizona," said Martel.<br/><br/>The DACA recipient and UCLA student was about 10 when SB 1070 became law in Arizona.<br/><br/>"We were in the Maricopa County, which is not the best county or place to grow up if you are undocumented," she said.<br/><br/>At the time it required police detain those suspected of being undocumented and request their immigration documents.<br/><br/>"I would go to school on Fridays not knowing if I would come back or if I came back, if my parents were going to be there," she said.<br/><br/>So, she and her family made Los Angeles home. Martel describes living in the U.S. as an opportunity she doesn't take for granted.<br/><br/>Now, the future of her work permit - which helps her pay tuition - is hanging in the balance of the U.S. Supreme Court.<br/><br/>"The day that the Trump administration decided to rescind DACA, that was the day we were supposed to send my brother's paperwork," she recalled.<br/><br/>"It's been a really big rollercoaster," she added.<br/><br/>The political science major who wants to attend law school says she has a plan in place if DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, ends.<br/><br/>But for now, she's marching forward.<br/><br/>"There's also undocumented people who don't even have DACA that are here supporting DACA," she said as she attended a rally Tuesday. "It's a very heartwarming experience."</p>
