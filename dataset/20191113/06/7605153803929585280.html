        <b><i>Luanda, Angola, Nov 13 – </i>Angola’s opposition chief steps down this week after leading the party for 16 years, contending that the former rebel movement is on track to winning power.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Isaias Samakuva, 73, took the helm of UNITA in 2003, a year after its founder Jonas Savimbi was killed in battle with government troops.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>But the former rebel group has lost every election it has contested since Samakuva transformed it into an opposition party.</p>
      <p>In his final days in office, Samakuva told AFP that UNITA — the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola — had made far-reaching changes to lure voters and his successor could steer the party to victory at the ballot box.</p>
      <p>The oil-rich southwest African state has been ruled uninterrupted by the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) since independence from Portugal in 1975.</p>
      <p>For nearly three decades, it was a proxy battlefield in the Cold War, with the Soviet Union backing the Marxist MPLA against the Western-supported UNITA.</p>
      <p>“I know the challenges that lie ahead are enormous,” said Samakuva.</p>
      <p>He spoke to AFP ahead of UNITA’s congress, which opens on Wednesday and will climax with the election of his successor.</p>
      <p>“I sincerely hope that UNITA will take power,” he said. “It is possible”.</p>
      <p>Angola’s next general elections are scheduled to be held in 2022.</p>
      <p>Formed during Angola’s independence war in 1966, UNITA has long been associated with its charismatic but authoritarian founder Savimbi.</p>
      <p>The civil war lasted 27 years and claimed at least half a million lives.</p>
      <p>Only when Savimbi was shot dead in 2002 were weapons laid down, paving the way for UNITA’s transformation into an opposition party — but the MPLA’s steely grip on power has remained.</p>
      <p>– ‘D-day is coming’ –</p>
      <p>“We have done a lot of things,” said Samakuva, from his office at UNITA’s headquarters in Luanda.</p>
      <p>“First of all, we have been able to reorganise and restructure UNITA.”</p>
      <p>“Today, we are present everywhere in the country,” he said, adding that membership had risen from 900,000 in 2002 to over three million.</p>
      <p>UNITA secured 26 percent of the vote during Angola’s last election in 2017, a distant second to the MPLA, which won 61 percent.</p>
      <p>Despite that defeat, Samakuva remained upbeat.</p>
      <p>“The MPLA is no longer the same, in my opinion,” said Samakuva, suggesting UNITA’s influence was “growing”.</p>
      <p>“I think that D-Day is coming,” he added.</p>
      <p>Samakuva had already said he would step down after the 2017 poll.</p>
      <p>That election saw the end of ex-president Jose Eduardo dos Santos’s 38-year rule after he chose not to run for office again.</p>
      <p>His hand-picked successor Joao Lourenco won the vote on a promise to crack down on corruption.</p>
      <p>Samakuva admitted he had become less critical of the regime since Lourenco took power.</p>
      <p>“Joao Lourenco has tried to change the way of governing,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He has a lot of (good) intentions but life remains tough economically and socially… (while) the perpetrators of corruption are still there.”</p>
      <p>Despite extensive oil, gas and mineral reserves, the majority of Angolans live in poverty and continue to rely on subsistence agriculture.</p>
      <p>UNITA delegates will elect their new president on Friday.</p>
      <p>Five candidates are vying for the post, including UNITA’s parliamentary leader Adalberto Costa Junior and the party’s vice president Raul Danda.</p>
      <p>The ideal successor, according to Samakuva, should “ensure continuity” and be endowed with “a lot of energy and intelligence”.</p>
      <p>“It’s time to leave and give a chance to my comrades who also have ideas, energy and the desire to lead UNITA,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Sixteen (years) is a lot, I must now serve UNITA in another way.”</p>
