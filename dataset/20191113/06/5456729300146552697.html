      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:36:21+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/362627-u23-afcon-awoniyi-seals-victory-for-nigeria-over-zambia.html" target="_blank">Tunde Eludini</a></address>
      <p>The Nigeria U-23 team are back in contention at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt as they romped to a 3-1 victory over their counterparts from Zambia on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Taiwo Awoniyi sealed the victory as the Olympic Eagles shook off last weekend’s loss to Ivory Coast to move top of their group.</p>
      <p>Coach Imama Amapakabo’s side started on the backfoot against Zambia as Patson Daka got the curtain raiser of the game.</p>
      <p>However, the Nigeria U23s turned the game around, levelling up through Orji Okwonkwo and then racing ahead thanks to Kelechi Nwakali’s well taken free kick.</p>
      <p>Industrious Awoniyi made the points safe for Nigeria with the late goal that saw the Olympic Eagles secure a 3-1 victory.</p>
      <p>Group B is now delicately poised with all four teams still with a chance of qualifying for the semi final.</p>
      <p>This is Nigeria’s first win in two matches. They take on South Africa in their next outing.</p>
      <p>Zambia, despite having a point from two games can also still qualify depending on the results from the final group games.</p>
