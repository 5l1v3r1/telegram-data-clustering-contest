      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — AmBank Research expects spending in the coming festive seasons and from tourism-related activities will counter the current weakening of consumer sentiment in the near term.</p>
      <p>“For 2020, we expect the wholesale and retail trade segments to remain supportive in view of sustained domestic demand,” its chief economist, Dr Anthony Dass said in a note today.</p>
      <p>He said the segments would receive an impetus from the tourism sector following the Visit Malaysia 2020 campaign.</p>
      <p>Malaysia is set to receive 30 million tourist arrivals next year, contributing about RM100 billion in tourist receipts.</p>
      <p>According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, spending activities in September recorded a softer growth amid a high-base due to the tax holiday period in 2018.</p>
      <p>Distributive trade slowed down to 5.7 per cent year-on year (yoy) in the third quarter of 2019 from 6.1 per cent yoy in the second quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>Wholesale trade remaining flat at 5.8 per cent yoy, while retail sales softening to 7.1 per cent yoy compared to 7.5 per cent yoy in the second quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>Despite softer inflationary pressure in the economy amid the base effect, Dass said the ebbing momentum in spending activities is partly due to weaker consumer confidence, softening wage growth and a weaker ringgit which translated to higher cost for imported goods. — Bernama</p>
