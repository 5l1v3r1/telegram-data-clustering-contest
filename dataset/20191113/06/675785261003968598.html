      <h1>PSG identify Antoine Griezmann as replacement for Premier League transfer target Kylian Mbappe</h1>
      <h2>Mbappe has been strongly linked with a big-money move, with Real Madrid and Liverpool among the teams understood to be keen on signing the French World Cup winner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:58:29+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:58</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly monitoring Antoine Griezmann's situation at Barcelona as they prepare to face the possibility of life without Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p>Mbappe has been strongly linked with a big-money move in the summer, with Real Madrid and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> among the teams understood to be keen on signing the French World Cup winner.</p>
      <p>The Reds have long been linked with the French star, after first making an approach for him back in 2017 when he was at Monaco. And a recent link up with Nike as the Merseyside club’s kit sponsor has added fuel to the fire.</p>
      <p>Mbappe is one of Nike’s biggest stars, and there were suggestions this month that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> president Florentino Perez is genuinely worried the English Champions League winners have the resources to outbid even his own club.</p>

      <p>And <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2019/11/12/5dcabab146163f2f2b8b4589.html">Marca</a> claim that PSG have already begun to look at potential replacements, with Barca's struggling forward Griezmann at the top of their list.</p>
      <p>Griezmann, who also starred as France lifted the 2018 World Cup crown in Russia, has endured a stuttering start to his Nou Camp career after joining from La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid in the summer.</p>
      <p>The forward has notched just four goals in 15 appearances and is yet to win over the Barca fans.</p>
      <p>He would seemingly be a like-for-like replacement for Mbappe, who is believed to be pushing for a dream move to Spanish giants Real Madrid.</p>

      <p>And, while Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp would love to sign the former Monaco ace, he recently conceded that a move is unlikely to happen.</p>
      <p>"OK, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign Mbappe, what a player he is,” Klopp said.</p>
      <p>“But it is about the money of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance, sorry for killing that story.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there is a club in the world that can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG. And we are involved in that too. We cannot do it, it is as easy as that.</p>
      <p>"We have nothing (more) to say about it to be honest, but [buying] this calibre of player is difficult."</p>
