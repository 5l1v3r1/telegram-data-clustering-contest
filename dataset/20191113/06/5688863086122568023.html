        <b>Indian fast bowler Deepak Chahar has given credit to his 15 years of hard work for all the success that he has got lately as a bowler. The pacer bagged the best-ever bowling figures in T20Is in India's win over Bangladesh, giving away just seven runs and taking 6 wickets, which included a hat-trick.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Deepak Chahar has grabbed all the spotlight lately and has been India's latest hat-trick hero as his figures of 6-7 off 4 overs helped India beat Bangladesh and clinch the T20I series 2-1. Skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> credited him for taking wickets at crucial intervals and breaking vital partnerships which helped India beat Bangladesh comfortably by 30 runs.</p>
      <p>Chahar continued his amazing form in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy as he grabbed a four-wicket haul for Rajasthan against Vidarbha and though Rajasthan lost by one run, Chahar proved that he is an asset in the T20 format and can be one of India's key weapons heading into next year's T20 World Cup in Australia. Chahar credits his hard work and patience for having finally achieved the goal of playing for India and performing well.</p>
      <p>"I am really happy with my efforts. I have worked hard day in and day out and with godâ€™s blessings, I have been able to come so far," Chahar told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>"There were days when I did not know what to do, but in every difficult situation, I have been able to keep calm and deliver my best. That has worked for me. My faith in God has grown over the years," he added.</p>
      <p>Chahar first came into the limelight when he became a reliable new-ball bowler for the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/chennai_super_kings">Chennai Super Kings</a> and was wisely used by <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ms_dhoni">MS Dhoni</a> in the powerplay. But he also has had to adapt his game as there have been times where he has not gotten any assistance in the air or from the pitch. Chahar believes that adapting to different conditions is what made him a better bowler as he's had to learn different tricks and deliveries to keep the batsman guessing.</p>
      <p>"I knew that we had to play seven matches in Chennai, and it was obvious that I had to bowl a lot of slowers. So, I adjusted accordingly. Before that, I had learned the art of delivering knuckle balls. I practiced a lot because I knew that I would need to bowl at least three overs in Powerplays, and there, yorkers would come handy," Chahar asserted.</p>
      <p>"So, at the nets, I tried to master the art of bowling yorkers and that boosted my confidence. For a bowler, it is a very satisfying feeling to bowl yorkers, because in T20Is, you are bound to concede a few boundaries in an over. And in those times, you need a yorker to put the pressure back on the batsmen. Working on my yorkers, during the stint with Chennai Super Kings, has helped me immensely," he added.</p>
