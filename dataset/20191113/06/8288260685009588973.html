      <p>The Foreign Office has warned of increased security at European Christmas markets due to an ongoing terror threat.</p>
      <p>Each Christmas, the Frankfurt Christmas Market rolls into Birmingham, with popular festive markets across the continent.</p>
      <p>Brummies and British holidaymakers will routinely head abroad each November and December to enjoy the yuletide celebrations.</p>
      <p>But the Foreign Office has warned of increased security at such events in the likes of Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>It has said this is because of "general threat from terrorism".</p>

      <p>The full notice on the FO website reads for each country: "There is a general threat from terrorism. There may be increased security in place over the festive period, including at Christmas markets and other major events that might attract large crowds.</p>
      <p>"You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities."</p>
      <p>It comes after various attacks on Christmas markets in recent years, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/foreign-office-warns-increased-security-17246701">M.E.N</a> .</p>
      <p>In 2016, a truck was driven through the crowds of visitors at a market in Breitscheidplatz in the City West of Berlin killing 11 people and injuring 56.</p>
      <p>Two years later,  a gunman opened fire at a Christmas market in Strasbourg. Three people were killed and 12 others injured.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Here in the UK, the terror threat level was lowered from "severe" to "substantial" for the first time in five years as announced by the Home Office last week.</p>
      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK was still at "a high level of threat" and an attack could "occur without further warning".</p>
