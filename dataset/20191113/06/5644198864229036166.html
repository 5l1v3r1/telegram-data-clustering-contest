      <p>REUTERS: England midfielder Fabian Delph has been ruled out of their final Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo due to injury, the FA said in a statement http://www.thefa.com/news/2019/nov/12/england-mens-squad-update-fabian-delph-121119 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Delph arrived at England's training ground with an injury and has returned to his club Everton after it was determined he would not be fit for either game.</p>

      <p>England top Group A with 15 points from six games and will seal a Euro 2020 spot with a win or draw at home to Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday or if Kosovo lose to the Czech Republic. England visit Kosovo in their last qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>England are not calling up a replacement for Delph although Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson - who is suspended for the Montenegro match - was joining the squad on Tuesday.</p>
