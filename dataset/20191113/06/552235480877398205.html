      <h1>Hibs manager favourites profiled as Paul Kane gives his verdict on the top candidates</h1>
      <h2>The Hibs legend gives his thoughts on the men who could be king at Easter Road.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Hibs have upped their search for a new head coach this week with Jack Ross and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> at the forefront of Easter Road thoughts.</p>
      <p>A lot of big names from Pep Guardiola to Neil Lennon have had their say on the Hibs managerial search in recent days.</p>
      <p>The legendary Manchester City boss rang Easter Road sporting director Graeme Mathie to recommend Spanish coach Raul Caneda Perez for the vacant position.</p>
      <p>Celtic boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> also issued a firm hands-off message to his former club when they were linked with a move for his No. 2 John Kennedy.</p>
      <p>So <b><i>Record Sport</i> </b>has asked Hibs legend and life-long supporter Paul Kane to give his thoughts on some of the main runners and riders who are in the mix to succeed Paul Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JACK ROSS</b>

      <p>“Jack knows the Scottish game.</p>
      <p>“He has played up here and managed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> before he went down to Sunderland.</p>
      <p>“Jack will know what you need to be successful up here and that is what we need.</p>
      <p>“We can’t afford to appoint another Heckingbottom who comes up and misjudges the standard of the Scottish game.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have time to do that again because we need to get this team up and running quickly so we can start pulling away from danger.</p>
      <p>“Jack has come back up from Sunderland where it didn’t really work out the way he had hoped and he be looking to get back on track.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>NEIL WARNOCK</b>

      <p>“For me, the way Neil Warnock’s teams play football would work against him.</p>
      <p>“His football is pretty direct and defensive and he is not going to change his style football now he is coming to the end of his car</p>
      <p>“Right or wrong, the Hibs fans demand their team play in a certain style and that comes from the 1960 and 70s.</p>
      <p>“There is a demand to entertainment and that was shown when we won the Scottish Cup under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alan-stubbs">Alan Stubbs</a> or came back into the Premiership with Neil Lennon.</p>
      <p>“We had good attacking teams that not only excited but were also successful!”</p>

      <p>“The suggestion is that they have already interviewed the former Barnsley manager, Stendel.</p>
      <p>“In fairness, you are going to have to look at all the markets because Hibs is a big job.</p>
      <p>“You have to listen and talk to all the main candidates but the position we are in at the minute I think we need to go with someone who is experienced in the Scottish game.”</p>

      <p>“He doesn’t have any real experience of the British game.</p>
      <p>“I know <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> has put him forward but it would be too much of a step into the unknown for me.</p>
      <p>“He might be an experienced coach but it is too much of a risk for me.”</p>

        <b>JOHN KENNEDY</b>

      <p>“John has been at Celtic for a lot of years as a player, coach and assistant manager.</p>
      <p>“Does he always want to be classed as a No.2 or does he want to become his own man?</p>
      <p>“Maybe he is at that stage just now. “He has had 10 years coaching and has a lot of experience.</p>
      <p>“I would imagine that if he has an ambition to become a future Celtic manager then he will need to cut his teeth somewhere else to become that manager down the line.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know John at all.</p>
      <p>“I can only go with what other people say.</p>
      <p>“I am friendly with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> and he can’t speak any more highly of him.</p>
      <p>“I have never heard anyone say a bad word about John.</p>
      <p>“We all saw the winning mentality that Neil Lennon brought to Hibs and I would think Kennedy will instil something similar if Hibs were able to get him.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>STATEMENT OF INTENT</b>

      <p>“I had initially put my hat on John Hughes but he is not even getting an interview, so what do I know I about football!</p>
      <p>“I would say that from all the guys that have been mentioned it is a two-horse race between John Kennedy and Jack Ross.</p>
      <p>“I would probably edge towards Kennedy. “If you were able to get Kennedy away from Celtic I think that would show some ambition.</p>
      <p>“It is also the first big appointment of the new owner and I am sure he will want to put his stamp on things.</p>
      <p>“People outside and the Hibs fans will be looking for some statement of intent and if they could get Kennedy then I think that would make everybody sit up and take notice.</p>
      <p>“Unless the board pull a rabbit out of the hat and make another appointment that has gone under the radar!”</p>
