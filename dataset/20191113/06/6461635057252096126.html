      <h3>Paris Saint-Germain are keen on signing Barcelona forward Antoine Griezmann to replace Kyilan Mbappe if he leaves for Real Madrid…</h3>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann made the ‘dream’ move to FC Barcelona this summer for a sum of €120 million but the Frenchman’s time at the club is turning out to be more of a nightmare instead. Griezmann has not found the back of the net since the last 5 matches and has found it rather difficult to pay alongside club legend Lionel Messi. The ex-Atletico Madrid man’s recent dip in form is worrying the Blaugrana fans garnering mixed reactions on whether or not he was a good signing for the club.</p>
      <p>However, Griezmann has proved himself to be one of the best footballers in the world and also played a key role in helping France to lift their second World Cup in 2018. Subsequently, top clubs from all across Europe have been following the Frenchman and one such club is Paris Saint-Germain. PSG have been keen admirers of the Barca forward, and even tried to bring him to the club before he signed for Barcelona. The French champions, as reported by <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2019/11/12/5dcabab146163f2f2b8b4589.html"><b>FourFourTwo</b></a>, are considering Antoine Griezmann to be a potential replacement for their star forward Kylian Mbappe in case he decides to leave the French champions to join Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Mbappe has overshadowed Neymar in his three seasons at PSG and the young superstar has always dreamed of playing for Real Madrid, something that Los Blancos boss Zidane reiterated in a pre-match press conference. PSG would want  Mbappe to stay at the club for many more years to come, but sporting director Leonardo refused to promise that the 20 year old would sign a contract extension with PSG, as per <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/psg/leonardo-je-ne-veux-pas-faire-de-promesse-en-l-air-09-07-2019-8113218.php#xtor=AD-1481423553"><b>Le Parisien</b></a>. In the event that Mbappe leaves, PSG need to be prepared to replace him and have been closely monitoring Griezmann’s situation at Barca.</p>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann would form a formidable partnership alongside Neymar and Icardi at PSG and would, to an extent, successfully fill in the talent gap that would be created owing to Mbappe’s departure. Griezmann does seem unsettled at Barcelona but it is too early to make an impression. With Barcelona playing some important games in La Liga and the Champions League after the international break, the fans will be hoping that their new signing will find his form again and be clinical in these matches. However, in football, the future is uncertain and it is impossible to predict if a player will be at the club next season.</p>
      <p>Will PSG be successful in signing Griezmann if Mbappe leaves for Real Madrid?</p>
