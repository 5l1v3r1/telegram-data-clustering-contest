      <h1>Luis Enrique’s Greatest Barcelona B: Where Are They Now?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:23:52+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:23</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h4>Regarded as one of the best Barcelona B teams of all time, the squad of 2010/11 produced many promising talents, who are now a prominent part of their respective current teams and world football in general.</h4>
      <p>Barcelona B, under then manager Luis Enrique, reached the highest achievements during the 2010-11 season in Segunda División where the team finished third and qualified for the play-offs for a promotion to La Liga but could not participate in it as they are Barcelona’s reserve team.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique, who later went on to manage the first team, had a brilliant squad with many great talented players to work with. Most of the graduates went on to make a name for themselves in world football.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a look at how the prospects of that squad have fared since then.</p>
      <h3>Goalkeepers</h3>

      <h4>Jordi Masip (Real Valladolid CF, 30)</h4>
      <p>Masip was the third-choice goalkeeper for the first team for 4 years before joining Valladolid in 2017. With Barca, Jordi managed to appear for three Copa del Rey matches, including his debut in an 8-1 win over Huesca. He also played against Deportivo in a league game that ended in a 2-2 draw. Masip is currently the undisputed starter for Valladolid and recently played against his former teammates in a 5-1 loss.</p>
      <h4>Rubén Miño (UD Logroñés, 30)</h4>
      <p>Ruben, who was a starter under Enrique managed to feature only once for the first-team, where he played the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup in 2010, losing 3-1 to Sevilla. Since Barcelona, Mino has mainly played for Mallorca, Oviedo, Politehnica Iași and AEK Larnaca. Currently, under contract with  Segunda División B side UD Logrones, the Spaniard played as a backup for De Gea in their U21 European Championship in 2011.</p>
      <h4>Oier Olazábal (Levante UD, 30)</h4>
      <p>Oier made his debut for the first-team in a Copa del Rey draw (2-2) against CD Alcoyano. He made his league appearance a year later in a 1-2 away loss to Mallorca. Oier has since played for Granada and  Real Sociedad and is currently under contract with Levante where he plays as a substitute goalkeeper.</p>
      <h3>Defenders</h3>

Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Andreu Fontàs (Sporting Kansas City, Centre-Back, 29)</h4>
      <p>Fontas made his first-team debut in the 2009/10 season, under then-manager Guardiola, in a 3-0 victory over Sporting Gijon. He continued as a rotational player for the next 2 years but ended up sustaining a serious injury and was later sold to Mallorca. After Mallorca’s relegation from La Liga, Fontas joined Celta Vigo for five seasons. He was a crucial part of the team for the first two seasons with the club but later lost his relevance. Fontas is currently signed with the MLS side, Sporting Kansas City.</p>
      <h4>Marc Bartra (Real Betis, Centre-Back, 28)</h4>
      <p>Bartra is another player that debuted under Guardiola. He managed to partake in the club’s five league triumphs, two Copa del Rey victories, and two Champions League titles. With clubs legends like Pique, Puyol, and Mascherano sharing the playing time, Bartra decided to sign with Borussia Dortmund where he managed to win a German Cup. He is currently with Betis, where he is a crucial part of the team under manager Rubi.</p>
      <h4>Marc Muniesa (Al Arabi, Centre-Back, 27)</h4>
      <p>One of the most promising defenders of this squad, he debuted under Guardiola at the age of seventeen against Osasuna. The debut, however, was not a success as the player was sent off shortly after joining the match as a substitute.  Muniese in the following season mostly played for the B team with his next first-team action coming in the Champions League fixture against Bate Borisov in the 2011/12 campaign.</p>
      <p>During a 2012 preseason game with the first-team, the youngster snapped his knee ligament which resulted in his subsequent move to Stroke City at the end of that season. He appeared 57 times for the Premier League side in the span of four seasons. He later joined Girona for two seasons, first as a loanee and later as a transfer for 5 million euros. He appeared for the Catalan side for 32 games, before getting transferred to Qatar side, Al Arabi, earlier this year.</p>
      <h4>Sergi Gomez (Sevilla FC, Centre-Back, 27)</h4>
      <p>Gomez initially only appeared for three Segunda Division B games for the club’s B side, but later played a crucial role in their promotion to playoffs due to the injury of, then first-choice, Andreu Fontas.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola provided the player his first-team debut in 2010 in a first leg fixture of the Supercopa de Espana against Sevilla FC. He played for the entire 90 minutes which ended in an away loss 1-3 for the club. The youngster now mainly features only for the youth teams and the reserves.</p>
      <p>As a free agent, Gomez, joined  RC Celta de Vigo in 2014 where he appeared for 111 games in a span of three years. He later signed a four-year contract with Sevilla FC in 2018.</p>
      <h4>Martín Montoya  (Brighton, Right-Back, 28)</h4>
      <p>Many considered Montoya to be the future of Barcelona’s Right-Back position. He managed to be a part of Barca’s 2011 and 2013 La Liga titles, 2012 Copa del Rey and also the treble in 2015. He left Barcelona after the treble on a loan deal to join Inter, where he managed to appear for the Italian side for mere 3 games. He later had another loan sting with Betis and in the following campaign, was transferred to Valencia for 2 seasons on a free transfer.  Montoya is currently signed by the Premier League side, Brighton.</p>
      <h3>Central Midfielders</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>Jonathan dos Santos (LA Galaxy, Central Midfield, 29)</h4>
      <p>Jonathan had his first-team debut in 2009, as a substitute for Seydou Keita in an away game against Cultural Leonesa in the Copa del Rey competition. His Champions League debut was against Inter in a 2-0 win where Dos Santos came as a replacement for Iniesta in the 92nd minute. The midfielder signed a five-year contract with Villareal in 2014 to join brother Giovani dos Santos, where the Mexican featured for the club in 116 matches. He later followed his brother to MLS side LA Galaxy in 2017 for a reported fee of around 5-6 Million Euros.</p>
      <h4>Thiago Alcantara (Bayern Munich, Central Midfield, 28)</h4>
      <p>One of the best midfielders in world football and initially regarded by many as the next Iniesta/Xavi made him a perfect prospect for Barca. He suffered through a few injury spells that saw his form lose its consistency. Due to the huge competition in the midfield, Thiago decided to sign for the German side, Bayern Munich, for 25 million euros in 2013. The midfielder has made 194 appearances for the Bavarian side.</p>
      <h4>Sergi Roberto (FC Barcelona, Central Midfield, 27)</h4>
      <p>The only player on the list who still plays for Barca, and also is a regular for the team. He currently plays as a right-back with occasional features in the midfield. Roberto has won everything with the Spanish champions. He also occasionally features for the Spanish national team. Roberto has made 237 appearances for the club so far.</p>
      <h4>Rafinha Alcantara (Celta de Vigo, Central Midfield, 26)</h4>
      <p>Rafinha has won everything with Barcelona and is currently loaned to Celta for the second time in his career, initially been loaned to the Vigo side for the 2013/14 campaign. Before returning to Celta, the Brazilian also played as a loanee with Inter Milan. He has struggled through several injuries with Barca preventing the midfielder from securing his place in the first-team.</p>
      <h3>Defensive and Attacking Midfields</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>Oriol Romeu (Southampton FC, Defensive Midfield, 28)</h4>
      <p>Oriol debut for the first-team came in a way of a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the team’s Spanish SuperCup 2010 fixture against Sevilla. His first league appearance was in a goalless draw against Deportivo, where Romeu came in as a substitute for fellow La Masia graduate, Jonathan dos Santos. The Arrival of Mascherano from Liverpool in 2011 led to the midfielder’s transfer to Chelsea for a fee close to five million euros. He played for the London side for 2 years but was subsequently loaned out after the departure of Andre Villas-Boas. His two-season long loan spells were with Valencia and Stuttgart respectively. He signed for Premier League’s Southampton in 2015 for seven million euros.</p>
      <h4>Rubén Rochina (Levante UD, Attacking Midfield, 28)</h4>
      <p>Rochina made 26 appearances for Barca B side before joining Premier League team Blackburn Rovers on a four-year deal in 2011. He made his league debut for the new side, in a 2-0 defeat against Everton. In the second half of the 2012 season, the midfielder was loaned out to Real Zaragoza where he made his La Liga debut against Malaga CF in a 1-1 draw. At the beginning of the 2013/14 campaign, Ruben dislocated his shoulder which led to his eventual loan spell with the Spanish side, Rayo Vallecano, but then was signed by Granada within the next six months for a four-year deal. In 2016, Rochina moved away from Spain for the second time in his career when Russian side FC Rubin Kazan triggered his 10 million euro release clause. The Spaniard returned to his homeland by joining Levante on a loan deal in 2018 which was followed by his permanent move to the club for a three-year deal.</p>
      <h4>Javier Espinosa ( FC Twente, Attacking Midfield, 27)</h4>
      <p>After 4 seasons with Barcelona B managing 101 appearances for the youth team, Espinosa signed for Villareal. Javier has struggled to find a permanent club and as a result, has played for Villarreal, Levante, Almeria, Elche, and Granada in the span of 4 seasons, with the latter three clubs being a loan spell.  In 2018, Espinosa moved abroad for the first time in his career after terminating his contract with Levante, and signing for Dutch side FC Twente.</p>

      <h4>Cristian Tello (Real Betis, Left-Wing, 28)</h4>
      <p>Tello played a crucial role under Guardiola and late Tito Vilanova, scoring goals across all competitions. Cristian lost his importance under then-manager Tata Martino, which led to his loan spell with Porto followed by another with the Italian side, Fiorentina. In 2017, Real Betis signed the forward for four million euros where the Spaniard has appeared for 82 matches ever since.</p>
      <h4>Nolito (Sevilla FC, Left-Wing, 33)</h4>
      <p>Nolito arrived in Barca B in 2008, where he has made his career highest appearance having played 106 games. He made his first-team debut in a League match against Mallorca that ended in a 1-1 draw. The winger rejected Barcelona’s contract offer that will see him join the first-team and instead signed with the Portuguese side, Benfica, for a five-year deal in 2011. His debut with Benefica was in a Champions League match against Trabzonspor where he scored once in a 2-0 victory. The forward, following a loan spell with Granada, signed for Celta in 2013. The contract was a four-year deal and saw the former Barca B player join with former coach Luis Enrique. He managed to appear in 100 matches for the club, in which he scored 36 goals. Nolito joined Premier League side Manchester City in 2016, on a four-year deal for a fee of just over 16 million euros. He made his debut against Sunderland in a 2-1 victory at home. Nolito and family were unsettled in Manchester and thus joined the Spanish side, Sevilla, on a three year deal in 2017.</p>
      <h4>Carlos Carmona (Sporting Gijón, Right-Wing, 32)</h4>
      <p>Originally a prospect from the youth system of Mallorca, Carmona joined Barcelona B at the age of 23. Prior to joining Barca in 2010, Carlos had already played for Recreativo, Mallorca, Valladolid, and Cartagena, with the latter two being a loan spell. The winger represented Barca B on 55 occasions before signing for Sporting Gijón in 2012. The player has made 169 appearances for the club, scoring 28 goals in the process. Los Rojiblancos currently play in the  Segunda División and Carmona recently has renewed his contract with the club until 2021.</p>
      <h4>Gerard Deulofeu (Watford FC, Right-Wing, 25)</h4>
      <p>Deulofeu, like many others on the list, had his debut under Guardiola at the age of 17. The talented winger could not meet the expectations of then-manager Martino and was loaned to Everton followed by another spell with Sevilla. Everton later signed the Spaniard for six million euros but after losing his importance, he was again loaned out to Milan. With Rossoneri, however, the winger managed to find his form and deliver many good performances which led to the Spanish National team calling Gerard up. This eventually impressed Barca enough to sign the player back for 12 million euros. Initially, Deulofeu was offered the starter role but was soon loaned out to Watford who later signed the player for 13 million euros.</p>
      <h4>Jonathan Soriano (Girona FC, Centre-Forward, 34)</h4>
      <p>Soriano made his official first-team debut in 2009, playing the final few minutes of a 2-0 victory over Cultural y Deportiva Leonesa for the Copa del Rey. Jonathan failed to seal a contract with Barcelona in 2012 and later moved to the Austrian Football Bundesliga with FC Red Bull Salzburg. He had an incredible spell with the Austrian side, scoring 172 goals in 202 games. The clinical striker moved to Chinese team Beijing Sinobo Guoan in 2017, where he continued his form managing to score 25 goals in 31 appearances. He is currently under contract with the second division side, Girona FC, on a one-year deal.</p>
