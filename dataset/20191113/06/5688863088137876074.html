        <b>Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne has decided to rejoin his county club Glamorgan by signing a fresh two-year deal with the club. Labuschagne had an impressive Ashes series where he starred with the bat alongside Steve Smith and gave credit to his stint with Glamorgan prior to the series.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne has decided to rejoin Glamorgan by signing a two-year deal with the club and he believes that it was his stint with Glamorgan that helped him perform well in the Ashes series. He had scored 1114 runs in 10 matches for Glamorgan in the lead-up to a stellar Ashes series that has cemented his place in the Australian Test side.</p>
      <p>"I'm absolutely rapt to re-sign and come back to Cardiff for another two years," Labuschagne was quoted as saying by Cricbuzz. "I love the city and loved playing for the club. The boys were incredible and I felt part of something special," he added.</p>
      <p>Glamorgan coach Matthew Maynard also gave his opinion on having Labuschagne back in the Glamorgan squad and is extremely happy that the club managed to tie him down for two years.</p>
      <p>"It's brilliant, he brought a huge amount of energy to the team last year," said Maynard.</p>
      <p>"He had a huge amount of skill with the bat, with his leg-spin and in the field, as well as his character. He reminded me very much of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/viv_richards">Viv Richards</a> in terms of his drive, his passion and being a real leader on the field," he further added.</p>
      <p>Getting compared to the likes of Sir Vivian Richards is not a mean feat and 25-year-old Labuschagne will like to repay the faith shown in him by Glamorgan. One of the strong points of Labuschagne, according to Maynard, is that he can battle out on the field with the bat and has the temperament to go on for long periods of play without scoring and just absorbing the pressure. The experience he has gained from the Ashes is invaluable and Maynard believes that he will be a great asset to Glamorgan yet again.</p>
      <p>"You can learn so much from a player like Marnus, he's a proper cricket badger who wants to work on his game all the time and better himself. If I was still playing, I'd love to bat with him because even as an experienced player I'd still learn from him, a real warrior," Maynard concluded.</p>
