      <h1>Neil Lennon's Celtic full-back poser as he looks to channel Jeremie Frimpong's 'exuberance'</h1>
      <h2>Jim Craig reckons the Celtic boss has a difficult balancing act on his hands with three top-quality right-back in the squad.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon proved to be Celtic’s ultimate problem solver when he faced one serious question in the summer transfer window and came up with three right answers. </p>
      <p>Find a capable replacement for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mikael-lustig">Mikael Lustig</a> ? No problem. </p>
      <p>The right-back riddle that had troubled the Hoops ever since Lennon’s first spell wasn’t only sorted. It was turned completely on its head. </p>
      <p>Instead of having to shuffle his squad to fill in for Lustig the headache now facing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> is which one of Hatem Elhamed, Jeremy Frimpong and Moritz Bauer is the best option to start? </p>
      <p>It’s a situation which has become the centre of pub debate among the Hoops support as they hunt down nine-in-a-row. </p>
      <p>And it’s a dilemma which has also caught the attention of one of the original 9 in a row side, Jim Craig. </p>
      <p>The Lisbon Lion is renowned for being one of the first ‘modern day’ attacking full-backs when he was launched on to the big time by Jock Stein in 1966. </p>
      <p>Craig reckons the embarrassment of riches in his position at the club is similar to when he first broke through as a 23-year-old under Stein. </p>
      <p>And he has a special word of advice for teenage sensation <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremie-frimpong">Jeremie Frimpong</a> who has gone from a deadline day ‘signing for the future’ to an integral part of Lennon’s title chasing side.</p>

      <p>Asked how he rated the three, Craig told <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>: “Let’s just say I think they all have their own strengths that they can bring into play defensively or attacking wise. </p>
      <p>“The big difference in those days was we also had a winger to deal with which you don’t have nowadays. So full-backs have more of a free reign to push forward and sometimes I think that can cause a problem because there is nobody back to help out their centre backs - they are actually a bit further forward than they should be. </p>
      <p>“I’m not blaming them for that it’s just the nature of the game these days and it’s the way they have been brought up. </p>
      <p>“ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jock-stein">Jock Stein</a> used to say to us at different times, ‘Calm yourselves gentlemen and remember you are defenders first and attackers second’. </p>
      <p>“The main thing is that you have got to get your place in the team.</p>
      <p>“We will see as time goes on how the three guys do but so far everything is looking good. </p>
      <p>“But three into one doesn’t go!” </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And that’s the big problem Craig can see - especially when there is no reserve football for those not playing regularly to keep them up to speed. </p>
      <p>Elhamed has been the preferred choice for the majority of the campaign having made 13 appearances while Bauer has six - mostly off the bench - and 18-year-old Frimpong has now enjoyed five starts.</p>
      <p>Craig said: “I feel for them to be honest because they are the ones who have to put up with occasionally not being in the team.</p>
      <p>“I had a similar experience myself because when I joined I was sitting my finals in dentistry and they toured America. The team did pretty well out there. So when they came back for the first six months of the new season it was Tommy Gemmill and Willie O’Neill that were full-backs.</p>
      <p>“The boss kept saying, ‘The boys are doing okay and I can’t change the team just because you are waiting to get back into it’.</p>
      <p>“But then they had a bad spell just around the start of Christmas.</p>
      <p>“I got in and that was it.</p>
      <p>“You have to get the chance first of all then you have to take the chance.</p>
      <p>“One of the problems these guys have is that nowadays you don’t have a reserve team.</p>

      <p>“Back when I was playing if you were not in the first team you were in the reserves and if you showed up well there then the manager would be passing on the message to Jock Stein. </p>
      <p>“Nowadays they don’t have that and they only have the youth team. </p>
      <p>“So the big problem is for these guys to get the chance to showcase their talents in the right environment.” </p>
      <p>Craig reckons it will be horses for courses as the season progresses on the home and European fronts. But he is sure there’s no substitute for experience - with a touch of youthful exuberance.</p>
      <p>“A combination of the two is the perfect answer,” he said. “You really want a bit of youthful enthusiasm and when you are a younger man you get the drive as well.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But there’s nothing like being able to assess the situation from the back, picking your area to stand in and make sure you have everything covered.</p>
      <p>“But that only comes with playing games and we get back to the initial point - when do you get the chance to play with the team mates that you are alongside and behind in the side. </p>
      <p>“Neil has three good players there who will all do the job. It’s now up to the manager to decide who fits best into his pattern and thoughts. That’s something that has to come from him. </p>
      <p>“When I was playing I was only interested in the inside left - he was the guy that I wanted to know his name so I could subdue him. </p>
      <p>“But the modern full-back who has all this room to come forward just has to remember he is a defender first and an attacker second and he has to be back to help out when the opposition is on the prowl.</p>
      <p>“Again that’s something that the coaching staff have to work out.”</p>
