      <p>SYDNEY, Nov 13 — A helicopter crashed while fighting a bushfire in northern Australia today and the pilot managed to survive with only minor injuries, officials said.</p>
      <p>“The helicopter crashed during waterbombing operations at the Pechey fire today,” a Queensland Fire and Emergency Service spokesperson told AFP.</p>
      <p>A rescue helicopter was sent to the scene and the pilot was treated for minor injuries, a Queensland Ambulance Service spokesman told AFP.</p>
      <p>“We transported one male with non-life-threatening injuries to Toowoomba Hospital,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The pilot is now in a stable condition.</p>
      <p>The bushfire at Pechey, north of Toowoomba, was sparked yesterday and is "getting worse," according to the fire service.</p>
      <p>Firefighters on the ground have been battling the blaze with support from aerial waterbombers.</p>
      <p>Queensland is on high alert amid severe fire conditions, with a forecast wind change expected to worsen several large blazes in difficult-to-access areas of the state.</p>
      <p>About 70 fires are burning in the state, with Pechey residents told the safest option is to leave the area as conditions are currently too dangerous.</p>
      <p>Dozens of fires are also ablaze in neighbouring New South Wales state, where cooler southerly winds have eased conditions and brought relief to firefighters and residents.</p>
      <p>Difficult conditions were expected to flare again at the weekend as the temperature rises and winds pick up. — AFP</p>
