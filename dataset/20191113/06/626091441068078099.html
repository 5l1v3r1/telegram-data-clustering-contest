      <p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/~pacopico">pacopico</a> writes: <i>GitHub's CEO Nat Friedman traveled to Svalbard in October <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave">to stash Linux, Android, and 6,000 other open-source projects in a permafrost-filled, abandoned coal mine</a>. It's part of a project to safeguard the world's software from existential threats and also just to archive the code for posterity. As Friedman says, "If you told someone 20 years ago that in 2020, all of human civilization will depend on and run on open-source code written for free by volunteers in countries all around the world who don't know each other, and it'll just be downloaded and put into almost every product, I think people would say, 'That's crazy, that's never going to happen. Software is written by big, professional companies.' It's sort of a magical moment. Having a historical record of this will, I think, be valuable to future generations." GitHub plans to open several more vaults in other places around the world and to store any code that people want included.</i></p>
