      <p>Stella McCartney has sparked a fierce backlash for an 'insensitive' Meghan Markle Remembrance Sunday post.</p>
      <p>The British designer took to social media to share a photograph of the Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p>Stella, who is the daughter of Paul McCartney, posted an image of Meghan, who is married to Prince Harry, at this year's Remembrance Sunday service.</p>
      <p>In the photograph, Meghan - who gave birth to baby Archie earlier this year - was seen wearing a matching navy woolen coat and hat ensemble.</p>

      <p>Stella captioned the image: "So honoured to have  HRH Duchess of Sussex in our Autumn '19 coat at Remembrance Day service. x Stella #RemembranceDay."</p>
      <p>Instagram users subsequently slammed Stella over her "disrespectful" choice of words.</p>
      <p>"Using remembrance day to advertise your clothes is a little disrespectful!! People died and you take pictures of people showing respect for advertising purposes. Just wrong," said one critic.</p>
      <p>A second added: "Remembrance day is to honour those that fought for us not to use for advertising purposes. Pretty shocked."</p>
      <p>"Nice - but not really a time to be advertising your clothes, Stella," wrote a third.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Stella is yet to issue a comment on the backlash it caused.</p>
      <p>The image has been removed from Instagram.</p>
