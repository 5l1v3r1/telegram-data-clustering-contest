      <p>Styles also appeared to hint at wanting to become a Hollywood star too, after recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/harry-styles-wants-next-james-bond-2563455">admitting that he is keen to play James Bond.</a></p>
      <p>He told Hits Radio: “Yeah, I mean, who wouldn’t [want to be Bond]? I grew up watching those. You know, I loved him when I was a kid. So I think it’s kind of everyone’s dream a little bit, right?”</p>
      <p>Styles also recently confirmed that he was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/harry-styles-reveals-reason-decline-role-prince-eric-little-mermaid-2564136">offered the role of Prince Eric</a> in Disney’s forthcoming live-action reboot of <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, but turned down the role because his upcoming plans for his music didn’t align with the film’s production schedule.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/is-harry-styles-being-lined-up-for-glastonbury-next-year-2564638">Meanwhile, rumours that Styles may have been appearing at Glastonbury 2020</a> proved premature as the singer’s US tour dates clash with the festival’s 50th anniversary celebrations.</p>
