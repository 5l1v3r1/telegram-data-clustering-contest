      <h1>You can thank a Sonic Mania artist for the fantastic Sonic movie redesign</h1>
      <h2>Calling in the pros</h2>

      <p><i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-sonic-mania-453928.phtml">Sonic Mania</a></i> is one of the few truly great <i>Sonic</i> creations in recent memory. It lovingly captured the essence of the classic <i>Sonic</i> games and wrapped them up in a modern-yet-retro package. <i>Sonic Mania</i> was proof that this group of developers "got" <i>Sonic</i>. It only makes sense that Paramount enlisted the help of one of them when fixing the movie.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Paramount pulled back the veil on the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-redesign-revealed-in-brand-new-trailer-572234.phtml">new-look Sonic the Hedgehog</a> after the first design went over as well as a lead balloon. The redesign was met with near-universal approval, most everyone agreeing that this is a more acceptable version of Sonic. Recently, long-time <i>Sonic</i> artist Tyson Hesse confirmed that he was brought in to "lead the design" on the modified Blue Blur.</p>

      <p>Hesse has a lot of experience with illustrating Sonic. Apart from serving as director and lead animator for the <i>Sonic Mania</i> opening cinematic, he also created the promotional mini-series <i>Sonic Mania Adventures</i>. Additionally, Hesse has contributed as an artist on the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> comic series.</p>
      <p>So, if you're thankful that the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> movie (probably) won't be as embarrassing anymore, Hesse is the person who's largely responsible for that. Three cheers for changing the chompers! Hip hip hooray...!</p>
