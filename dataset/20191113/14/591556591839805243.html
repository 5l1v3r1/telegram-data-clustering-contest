      <p>Apple has today unveiled <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-unveils-new-16-inch-macbook-pro/">its long-rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, aimed at professionals and high-end creative types who want portability without compromise. And portability without compromise means lots of storage and RAM.<br/><br/>But all that hardware comes at a cost.<br/><br/><b>Must read</b>: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/volta-xl-a-cable-that-can-stop-you-destroying-your-precious-macbook/">Volta XL: A cable that can stop you destroying your precious MacBook</a><br/><br/>The tech specs of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro are very impressive and offer a significant hardware upgrade compared to the 15.4-inch version it replaces.<br/><br/><b>Tech specs:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Silver or space gray</li>
        <li>16-inch, 3,072 x 1,920-pixel display (compare this to 2,880 x 1,800 on the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro)</li>
        <li>Ninth-generation 2.6GHz six-core Intel Core i7 or 2.3GHz Intel Core i9 (up to an eight-core Core i9)</li>
        <li>16GB DDR4 RAM (up to 64GB)</li>
        <li>AMD Radeon Pro 5300M or 5500M, 4GB GDDR6 memory (up to 8GB)</li>
        <li>512GB SSD (up to 8TB)</li>
        <li>Four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports</li>
        <li>100 watt-hour battery</li>
        <li>$2,399 starting price</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But that's just the starting price. Let's take a look at what the upgrades cost.<br/><br/>First off, a bump from the 2.6GHz 6‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i7 processor to the 2.4GHz 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 silicon is a somewhat $300.</p>
      <p>Taking the AMD Radeon Pro 5300M GPU with 4GB of GDDR6 memory to the Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of GDDR6 memory is another $200.<br/><br/>Not bad. So far.<br/><br/>If you want to upgrade the RAM from the stock 16GB 2666MHz DDR4 to 64GB, that will cost you $800.<br/><br/>That starting price of $2,399 is now already up to $3,699.<br/><br/>But what about the storage? The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the first notebook that can be kitted out with 8TB of storage, and going up from the base 512GB SSD to an 8TB SSD adds another $2,400 to the price.<br/><br/>The price is now up to a robust, yet somehow reassuring, $6,099. And while that's a lot for a laptop, you do get quite a lot of hardware for your money.</p>
