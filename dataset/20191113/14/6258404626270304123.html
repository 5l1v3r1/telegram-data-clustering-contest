      <p>Twitch launched a closed beta for Twitch Studio a few months ago. The beta was a new streaming app, and Twitch says that "tons" of streamers that signed up to try it. After taking all the feedback from the streamers who tried Twitch Studio beta, the beta is now open to everyone who wants to try it out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/twitch">Twitch</a> Studio Beta is available for anyone on <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/windows">Windows</a> 7 or newer operating system. To talk streamers into trying the open beta for the new Studio, Twitch is running down some of the best features of the beta software. The setup is guided, making it easy to detect your mic, webcam, monitor resolution, bitrate, and more to help the stream look and sound great.</p>
      <p>The beta offers customizable templates that give streamers just starting layouts and overlays to help personalize the look of the stream. Integrated alerts make it easy for new streamers to monitor and interact with their community using the built-in alerts, activity feed, and Twitch chat. There are some known bugs with the beta right now.</p>
      <p>Twitch says that to capture a game, app, or window in Twitch Studio, users need to add a screen share or main screen share layer. In some cases, what users are trying to capture might not work. Instances of the capture failure issue have been seen on <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google-chrome">Google Chrome</a>, <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/firefox">Firefox</a>, and other browsers. <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and other games that block the capture injection process, and <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/vulkan">Vulkan</a>-powered games like Wolfenstein are known to cause issues with the beta. Twitch says a workaround is to capture the monitor in these instances.</p>
      <p>Supported capture cards in the beta include:</p>
