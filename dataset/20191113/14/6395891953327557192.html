      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Latest on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee about the outlook for the U.S. economy (all times local):</p>
      <p>9:35 a.m.</p>
      <p>Powell says in written testimony that the Federal Reserve is optimistic about the U.S. economy, though it still faces risks from slower growth overseas and trade tensions.</p>
      <p>"Looking ahead, my colleagues and I see a sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective as most likely," Powell said in a statement he will deliver to a congressional panel at 11 a.m.</p>
      <p>Powell also says the Fed is likely to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged in the coming months, unless the economy slows enough to cause Fed policymakers to make a "material reassessment" of their outlook.</p>

      <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to testify Wednesday in Congress about the outlook for the U.S. economy, giving his perspective two weeks after the Fed cut interest rates for a third time this year.</p>
      <p>The Fed signaled after its Oct. 29-30 meeting that it would probably hold off on any further cuts as long as the economy stays healthy and inflation moves closer to the central bank's target of 2%.</p>
      <p>The three cuts, which lowered the interest rate the Fed controls to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, were intended to offset drags from slower global growth and the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
