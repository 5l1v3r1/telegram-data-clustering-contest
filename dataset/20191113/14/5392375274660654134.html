      <p>A few days <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/nokia">Nokia</a> and Flipkart announced that they are collaborating to bring Nokia-branded smart TVs to the Indian market. At the time, there was no information about the Nokia TV. The most recent report regarding this TV shows that it has gotten the certification of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). This certification shows that the Nokia TV will feature a 55-inch 4K UHD panel. According to a BIS certification, the Nokia smart TV comes with model number 55CAUHDN. Besides this, there is not much information about this TV.</p>

      <p>There are also reports that this TV will run on Android 9 Pie and will come with Google Play Store. In addition, this TV may come with Intelligent Dimming technology which will offer better contrast with deeper black levels.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.lovenokia.net/2019/11/nokia-55-4k-uhd-tv-passes-bis-more-details-about-nokia-smart-tv-emerge.html">BIS certification</a> can only reveal the size of the TV. However, we already know that Nokia Smart TV will be manufactured in India, and will use JBL sound. Flipkart will launch the Nokia smart TV in the Indian market through the “India Manufacturing Plan”.</p>
      <p>Adarsh ​​Menon, senior vice president and head of private label, electronics and furniture business at Flipkart, said that the partnership with Nokia allows us to further provide high quality, technologically advanced products to consumers in the Indian market. Nokia is a world-renowned brand with a huge pedigree. Flipkart is happy to work with Nokia to bring the best brands and technologies together. Flipkart says it is ready to introduce the new TV to the 200 million consumers on its platform.</p>
