      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In morning, we saw an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/13/bitcoin-btc-price-eyeing-fresh-monthly-low-below-8-5k/">upside correction</a> in bitcoin from the $8,560 swing low against the US Dollar. However, BTC faced a strong resistance near the $8,800 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>There was another decline below the $8,750 level. Moreover, the price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $8,560 low to $8,839 high. The price even broke the $8,720 level, but it stayed above the $8,700 level.</p>
      <p>It seems like the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $8,560 low to $8,839 high is acting as a support. Recently, bitcoin price made another attempt to clear the $8,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average, but it failed.</p>
      <p>More importantly, morning’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/12/bitcoin-btc-price-primed-to-extend-losses-below-8-5k/">bearish trend line is active</a> with resistance near $8,775 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is once again declining and is trading below the $8,750 level.</p>
      <p>If the price fails to stay above the $8,700 level, it could continue to move down. The next support is near the $8,640 level. It represents the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $8,560 low to $8,839 high.</p>
      <p>It seems like bitcoin is setting up for a downward spike below the $8,600 support area. Additionally, it could even spike below the $8,500 support area before the bulls take a stand.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the price is likely to struggle near many resistances, starting with $8,800. The main resistance is near $8,900 and another important bearish trend line on the same chart. For that reason, a close above $8,920 is needed for a decent recovery.</p>
