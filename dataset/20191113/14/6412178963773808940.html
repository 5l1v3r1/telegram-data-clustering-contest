        <b>Leeds are interested in signing Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara, according to reports, with two options available to the club over a potential swoop.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kamara, who moved to Ibrox for £50,000 in January, has become a key part of Steven Gerrard’s side having made 20 appearances for his team already this season, including a solid performance in the 2-0 win over Porto last Thursday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/leeds-united-in-hunt-to-sign-rangers-player-valued-at-10m/"><b>Football Insider</b></a> report that Leeds scouts were impressed by what they saw of Kamara in that Europa League tie and have identified him as a potential player <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/marcelo-bielsa"><b>Marcelo Bielsa</b></a> could use in his squad.</p>
      <p>However, it is claimed that the Whites will put him on a list of summer targets, given that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/leeds-united"><b>the West Yorkshire outfit</b></a> are only planning to spend in January if some of their loan stars are recalled by their parent clubs.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the report states that Rangers have set an asking price of more than £8m for Kamara’s services, but have not given the actual figure it will cost to bring him south of the border.</p>
      <p>Kamara, formerly of Arsenal’s academy, left North London for Aberdeen in July 2017 before being snapped up by the Gers last summer.</p>
