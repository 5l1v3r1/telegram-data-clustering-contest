      <p>Renders of Xiaomi’s upcoming smartphone Mi 10, which is a successor to the Mi 9, leaked online, courtesy of Chinese publication <i>TechConfigurations</i>. The renders give us a detailed look at the upcoming Mi 10 smartphone.</p>
      <p>According to the leaked renders, the Mi 10 is going to feature a waterfall screen design that bends 90 degrees from the edges. Thus Xiaomi becomes the second Chinese tech firm to pack a waterfall design, which was first seen on Oppo’s Vivo Nex 3 smartphone.</p>

      <p>The smartphone is also expected to feature a 6.67-inch QHD display with a 96 percent screen-to-body ratio. Under the display, you’ll have a fingerprint reader, which you can use as a means to unlock your smartphone if you’re not a huge fan of unlocking a smartphone with PINs.</p>

      <p>Talking about the design, the upcoming Mi 10 is a bezel-less smartphone and is truly an all-screen smartphone. As you can see in the above images, it’s a rounded-corner form factor, unlike the Huawei mate 30 and 30 Pro. Xiaomi is using glass on the back, at the top of which a vertically-aligned triple camera setup can be seen.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the camera, or cameras should I say, the Mi 9 successor is going to have a 108MP Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX primary sensor with 3x optical zoom, and accompanying them will be a 20MP and a 16MP sensor. For selfies, you’ll have a 32MP shooter at the front.</p>
      <p>Powering the smartphone will be a powerful Snapdragon 865 processor. It’ll be available in three color options — blue, red, green, and pink.</p>
