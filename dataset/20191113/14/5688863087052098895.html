        <b>Manchester City star Bernardo Silva has been handed a one-match ban and a £50,000 fine for his social media post to and about Benjamin Mendy in September. The former Monaco midfielder’s post caused a few problems for him and the 25-year-old will now miss Manchester City’s game vs Chelsea.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nearly two months after Bernardo Silva’s social media post about and to Benjamin Mendy was published, the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_city">Manchester City</a> midfielder has been handed a one-game ban. The midfielder posted a photo of Mendy as a child alongside an image of Spanish company Conguitos, which had been condemned for racist undertones. The 25-year-old later deleted the tweet and even went on to say, "Can't even joke with a friend these days."</p>
      <p>The FA’s statement read "Bernardo Silva has been suspended for one first-team competitive fixture, fined £50,000 and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a breach of FA Rule E3. The Manchester City midfielder’s social media activity on 22September 2019 breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute and constituted an “Aggravated Breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City and Silva are yet to release any statement as to whether they are going to appeal the decision, with the Portuguese midfielder set to miss the game against top-four rivals <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chelsea">Chelsea</a>.</p>
