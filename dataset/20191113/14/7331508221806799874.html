      <p>This will be 51-year-old Piazza's first managerial experience since the 12-time All-Star retired in 2008 after a 16-year major league career.</p>
      <p>Piazza, who was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, is of Italian ancestry. He was Italy's hitting coach at the 2009 and 2013 WBC tournaments.</p>
      <p>He was the majority owner of AC Reggiana, a third-tier Italian soccer team, from 2016 until it ceased operations after the 2017-18 season.</p>
      <p>Italy finished as the runner-up at the European Baseball Championship this year. It has never made it past the second round in four WBC appearances.</p>
      <p>Piazza was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016. With a career batting average of .308, he hit better than .300 in nine straight seasons and finished with 427 home runs, including a record 396 when he was in the game behind the plate.</p>
