      <p>In a new interview, the star, 47, said she goes to bed with her makeup on and then gets up and does the school run.</p>

      <p>Speaking about her habit of not taking off her makeup, Claudia told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/style/3am-fashion-celebrity-beauty/claudia-winkleman-thinks-fringe-only-20870525">Mirror</a>: "I go to bed with my make-up on - it makes me have better dreams. Then I wake up, do the school run, have a nap, then I'll shower and take my make-up off."</p>
      <p>She added that with her hair she doesn't even dry it and if she's "pushing the boat out I might brush my fringe".</p>
      <p>Going on to joke about her iconic hairdo, Claudia said: "I think it's the only reason I get work. I'm sure TV producers go, 'Who's the one with the fringe? We'll have her.'"</p>
      <p>The star also revealed she learnt a few beauty tips from her mother.</p>

      <p>Claudia added: "Like me, my mum loves an orange glow, so I remember her swirling huge brushes of orange over her face and thinking it was the most glamorous thing ever."</p>
      <p>Last year, the presenter revealed she will never cut her famous fringe as she's had it for the past 15 to 16 years.</p>

      <p>She told Hello! magazine: "I haven't seen my forehead for about 15 years. I don't even know what's under my fringe - there could be squirrels, parrots - I've got no idea.</p>
      <p>"But no I can't imagine ever getting rid of it."</p>
      <p>Claudia is currently hosting the latest series of Strictly Come Dancing with Tess Daly.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Last weekend, the star apologised after making a joke about contestant Karim Zeroual.</p>
      <p>She joked that she would bring Karim and Amy Dowden back a "stick of rock" from Blackpool if they were eliminated that week after he became emotional following a mistake in his performance.</p>
      <p>After it was revealed that Karim and Amy had made it through on Sunday's results show, Claudia told him: "First of all I'm really sorry about the rock joke, I was just trying to make you laugh but I felt so bad."</p>
      <p>Karim told her: "You did make me laugh, don't be sorry, I wasn't upset, I was just disappointed about my dance but I love you for that, you know I love you."</p>
