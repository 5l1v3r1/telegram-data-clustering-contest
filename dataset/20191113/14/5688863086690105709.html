      <p>The Pakistan Women's team has been impressive lately as they conquered Bangladesh in the T20 series while went on to level the ODI series. Iqbal Imam who was the interim head coach for both the series has been awarded the position of head coach of the team. Imam was appointed as the batting coach of the team in April this year before taking up the post of the interim head coach.</p>
      <p>Imam has expressed how honoured he is on being promoted as he lauded the side with praise. The newly appointed head coach said that he will look to get the best out of the team which already has a lot of potential in it.</p>
      <p>"It is certainly an honour for me to be appointed as a head coach for the women's side," Cricbuzz quoted Imam.</p>
      <p>"Women's cricket in Pakistan is improving day-by-day and we have a lot of talented girls emerging. Our team has gotten off to a decent start this season by beating Bangladesh in the T20I series and levelling the ODI series. There's a great potential in the side to do wonders and I aim to bring the best out of them."</p>
      <p>In the meantime the interim skipper of the side, Bismah Maroof has also been promoted as the captain of the side until the upcoming T20 World Cup Down Under. Maroof has led the Pakistan Women's side in 15 ODIs and 33 T20Is since 2016. Maroof has expressed her wish to carry the team's winning momentum all the way to the World Cup and make a statement at the gala event.</p>
      <p>"It is truly an honour for me to be continuing as Pakistan's captain and I look forward to leading the side in the next year's T20 WC," Maroof said. "The team is in good shape and has produced some good performances recently. There's a great deal of talent and passion in the girls and I look forward to carrying the momentum to the World Cup."</p>
      <p>Pakistan Cricket Board's chief executive said that both Imam and Maroof have worked hard to earn their position in the team set up and expressed his confidence over both of them while talking about the new appointments.</p>
      <p>"Bismah Maroof and Iqbal Imam have put in the hard yards to be where they are today and I am very confident that the national women's team will thrive under them.</p>
      <p>"Iqbal has been with the team since April and he understands the demands of the job. He has the desired skillset and was right up there amongst the candidates who applied for the job. The Pakistan team showed improvements in their T20I and ODI series against Bangladesh under him and I hope that he will be able to carry forward the momentum gained from them."</p>
