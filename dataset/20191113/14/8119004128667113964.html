      <p>"We are supplying electricity at rates that are lower than the cost of production," she said.</p>
      <p>"I urge everyone to be prudent about power consumption so that there's no wastage."</p>
      <p>Hasina added that the government is working to supply electricity to the entire population of the country.</p>
