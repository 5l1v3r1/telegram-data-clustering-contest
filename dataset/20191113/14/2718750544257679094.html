      <p>Have you known this remix for 20 seconds or 20 years? Let the dreamy palette of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/taylor-swifts-lover-album-meaning-and-analysis.html">Taylor Swift</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/05/shawn-mendes-on-his-make-or-break-new-album.html">Shawn Mendes</a>’s “Lover” video wash over you with the fact that she originally wrote the song about <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/taylor-swifts-lover-album-meaning-and-analysis.html">a cup of plain oat milk</a> named Joe Alwyn, but the newly penned verses that Mendes croons are very nice and very seductive, in, like, a safe way: “We can light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby / Pictures of when we were young hang on the wall / We’ll sit on the stoop / I’ll sing love songs to you.” Just don’t accidentally knock the lit candles down when you’re dancing. Especially if you don’t have renters’ insurance. Fire damage can be a financial burden.</p>
