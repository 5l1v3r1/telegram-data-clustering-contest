      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:23:49+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author">Callum Carson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/callum-carson/</a></address>
      <p>Three members of Howden School of Taekwon-do proved they could mix it with the best by scooping gold medals on the international stage.</p>
      <p>Morgan McQuade, Blair Nelson and Callum Schooler, all from Livingston, were in fine form at the ITF Taekwon-do World Championships at Ravenscraig.</p>
      <p>The event boasted more than 20 competing nations and over 600 competitors, with the Livi trio all taking home gold medals.</p>
      <p>Morgan clinched two golds and a silver, which also saw her pick up the overall top competitor award for the 15-17 age category.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She progressed through several rounds to win her hard-earned silver medal in patterns before comprehensively winning the gold in sparring with a fine victory in the final.</p>
      <p>Morgan scooped a second gold as she won the special technique discipline kicking a high target.</p>
      <p>Blair matched his team-mate with a pair of gold medals while also adding a bronze to his tally, which saw him crowned overall top competitor in the 10-13 age category.</p>
      <p>He clinched gold in the sparring division before sealing another gold for the special technique discipline hitting a high target.</p>
      <p>He showed tremendous focus in the patterns to pick up a bronze medal to complete his remarkable tally.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Callum made sure it was a trio of golden success as he grabbed top spot in his sparring division.</p>
      <p>David Lupton, 6th degree black belt instructor at Howden, said: “Our young champions have been training now for over seven years and have been supported by each other and their families.</p>
      <p>“They have all shown great dedication and always give 100 per cent effort in training.</p>
      <p>“Senior coach Andrew McQuade and I are immensely proud of the students and can see a bright future for them.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully they will represent Scotland in major championships in the future.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The club won five gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal in the first World Championships for the young students. It was a fantastic achievement.”</p>
