      <p>SHOREWOOD, Wis. - All public schools in a Milwaukee suburb are closed after officials say a high school student wrote a hit list and was found in possession of a loaded magazine of ammunition.</p>
      <p>Shorewood School District officials said because of "ongoing safety concerns," classes and activities are canceled Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In a message to parents, Superintendent Bryan Davis said school officials and local police began investigating a student's report of a hit list Tuesday. Davis says they found the author of the list to be in possession of the loaded magazine and he was arrested. He says the student did not have a gun and none was found anywhere on the school campus.</p>
      <p>District officials say more details would be released later Wednesday.</p>
