      <p>The family of a former IRA member who was shot dead four years ago want to move his body.</p>
      <p>Kevin McGuigan Snr was gunned down at Comber Court in the Short Strand, Belfast, in August 2015.</p>
      <p>The father-of-nine was treated by paramedics at the scene before being taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital, but he died from his wounds.</p>
      <p>Lawyer Laura McMahon wrote to a coroner on behalf of relatives who believe he should be exhumed and reburied.</p>
      <p>She said: "The family are keen that they are together in death.</p>

      <p>"I am sure you will appreciate their motivation and where they are coming from."</p>
      <p>Coroner Paddy McGurgan said he would be committing a criminal offence if he ordered the body moved for purposes outside the coronial process.</p>

      <p>"This is one of those areas where the law is exceptionally clear in relation to the limit of my powers."</p>
      <p>Mr McGuigan's death followed the murder of Jock Davison in the Markets area of the city three months earlier.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/09/23/news/psni-had-information-about-a-gun-two-weeks-before-gerard-jock-davison-murder-1719301/">Read More: PSNI 'had information about a gun' two weeks before Gerard 'Jock' Davison murder</a>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Davison (47)  was a former IRA commander and former friend of Mr McGuigan.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday the coroner held a brief hearing on legal matters surrounding a future inquest. He directed that the full inquest go ahead without a jury.</p>
      <p>Thousands of pages of non-sensitive material and a significant amount of sensitive papers need to be sifted through, lawyers told the preliminary sitting.</p>
      <p>Mr McGurgan decided that suspects who have not been charged but may be mentioned during the inquest should be publicly known by ciphers to protect their identities.</p>
      <p>He said it was too early to set a date for the full inquest and scheduled another review hearing for March.</p>
      <p>Mr McGuigan's death led then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton to state that the Provisional IRA still existed and some of its members were involved in Mr McGuigan's murder.</p>
      <p>He said there is no evidence that the killing was sanctioned by the organisation.</p>
      <p>His statement prompted the UUP to pull out of the five-party ruling Executive.</p>
