      <p>An English <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/nhsscotland">paramedic working in Scotland</a> has been struck off after he abused colleagues by telling them 'I'm here to educate you thick Highlanders' and lambasted patients as 'fat, lazy Jocks'.</p>
      <p>Stuart Wright repeatedly showed 'disregard' to Scots and was heard saying 'another thick Jock who knows nothing' within earshot of a patient confused by technical language.</p>
      <p>White branded two elderly ladies - who turned out to be Italian - a 'couple of ignorant old Jocks' and he even got the Scottish Ambulance Service banned from a cafe following an angry row.</p>
      <p>A tribunal heard the 50-year-old also delayed going to call outs because he was watching rugby, shared a topless image of a colleague and warned colleagues he would 'stab anyone that got in his way'.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A Health and Care Professions Tribunal heard Wright was working in a remote area of Scotland when he abused fellow paramedics and patients over a period of eight months from October 2016.</p>
      <p>Wright, based in Kingussie in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/caingorms">Cairngorms</a> , was putting a mattress protector on a stretcher when one of his colleagues told him that wasn't standard practice.</p>
      <p>The enraged medic responded: "That's how we do it in England and I'm here to educate you thick Highlanders."</p>
      <p>On one day in January 2017, Wright was said to have been especially 'angry' as he and a colleague were called to an elderly male patient in a care home who had slipped out of his chair.</p>
      <p>After visiting the patient, the paramedic nearly collided with two elderly ladies who were crossing the road. As he drove past Wright glared at the ladies and said: "Couple of ignorant old Jocks."</p>
      <p>It was later discovered the ladies were Italian.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In response to being told he couldn't wear a watch due to risk of infection, he said: "Thick Jocks and their stupid fucking rules."</p>
      <p>Wright, who worked for the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) for five years, also refused to use his siren and sat in the ambulance texting while on call outs.</p>
      <p>Because he worked in a sparsely populated area of the Highlands, he did not work out of an ambulance station. Instead, along with three colleagues, he worked from home.</p>
      <p>Following an unexplained argument in a local cafe, Wright told all of his colleagues that if anyone tried to 'take him down', or got in his way or even said anything to him, he would 'stab them in the fucking neck.'</p>
      <p>The SAS were later banned from the premises.</p>
      <p>When visiting an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/obesity">obese patient</a> , the paramedic decided not to use the quickest route and said: "Why hurry for a fat lazy Jock?"</p>
      <p>He also delayed going to visit an elderly female patient saying: "It is only an old woman, what's the hurry?"</p>
      <p>Even while out on call-outs Wright was found to have behaved inappropriately and rather than helping his colleague with an asthmatic patient he leaned against his ambulance texting.</p>
      <p>When a girl was seriously injured in a skiing accident, he left his colleague waiting in the snow for 15 minutes while he finished watching a rugby match.</p>
      <p>In another incident Wright showed a fellow paramedic a topless photograph of a colleague without her consent. The woman in the picture later said she couldn't remember sending the picture but if she had, it would have been 'after a few drinks'.</p>
      <p>He also failed to use his lights on sirens on five separate call-outs and admitted he was selecting which ones to use them on.</p>
      <p>The Health and Care Professions Tribunal found: "Mr Wright's failings occurred in a number of different areas; deficient clinical performance, disregard demonstrated towards patients and colleagues, discriminatory language and aggressive behaviour included in the findings.</p>
      <p>"This in turn has resulted in the panel finding that the root cause of the problem was behavioural and attitudinal."</p>
      <p>Wright, who didn't attend the hearing and appears to be from Worcester originally according to a Linkedin profile, was struck off after a panel found he showed little remorse and would likely re-offend.</p>
