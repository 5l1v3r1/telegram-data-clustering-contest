      <p>Spotify has released a version of its music streaming app on Magic Leap’s headset, the augmented reality company <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/news/partner-stories/put-music-in-your-world-with-spotify-on-magic-leap-one">announced today</a>. The app will show a location-aware three-dimensional Spotify interface on top of your world with the ability to automatically change playlists as you move between rooms. You’ll need a Spotify Premium subscription in order to use the app.</p>
      <p>Spotify will sit alongside a <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/experiences">growing collection of apps</a> that are available for the augmented reality headset, which was first released as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17661758/magic-leap-one-mixed-reality-spatial-computing-headset-price-shipping-release-date">$2,295 developer edition last year</a>. These include games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17876488/angry-birds-magic-leap-one-rovio-first-person-slingshot-game-release-trailer"><i>Angry Birds: First Person Slingshot</i></a> and <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/experiences/star-wars-project-porg"><i>Star Wars: Project Porg</i></a>, as well as video-focused apps from the <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/news/product-updates/nba-app-launch">NBA</a>, <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/experiences/cnn">CNN</a>, and the Cheddar news network. However, this is the first time a major music streaming service has announced an app for the headset.</p>
      <aside>The headset has speakers built in, or you can use headphones</aside>
      <p>The Magic Leap headset has small built-in speakers placed near your ears, but there’s a jack for you to plug in your own pair of headphones. Earlier this year Magic Leap added the ability for its headsets to <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/news/for-creators/overture-your-music-app-connection">play music in the background while you use other apps</a>, and the Spotify app is the first to make use of this functionality.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes just days after reports emerged that <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/magic-leap-series-e-funding-1203401035/">Magic Leap is embarking upon another big funding round</a>. The company said that it’s currently working to expand its content and developer ecosystems, and is also developing a second generation device.</p>
