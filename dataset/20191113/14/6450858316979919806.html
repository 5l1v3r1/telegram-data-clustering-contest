      <h3>Your buying guide for the best wireless headphones in 2018</h3>
      <p>Being tied to a cable isn't what the modern consumer wants, and with phones from the iPhone 11 to the Pixel 4 not having a headphone jack, going wireless might be essential.</p>
      <p>It's never been a better time to buy some wireless headphones. There are more than ever on the market, with all kinds of shapes and sizes on offer. The latest technology also means you're not making the same sacrifices on sound quality that you used to either.</p>
      <h3>How much should I spend on wireless headphones?</h3>
      <p>These days, you can get wireless headphones at pretty much any price point. Headphone makers have realised that not everyone wants to shell out hundreds of pounds for huge cans so the technology is even found inside small in-ear headphones.</p>
      <p>We've rounded up the best wireless headphones from both our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/audio/best-cheap-headphones-of-2017-3535038/">budget chart</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/audio/best-headphones-of-2017-3265130/">high-end chart</a> (some of which appear here) so you'll be able to find something to fit your budget. If you're out for a bargain, take a look at our pick of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/black-friday-deals-2016/headphones/">best headphones deals</a>.</p>
      <p>We also have a dedicated round-up for the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/audio/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-3775758/">best noise cancelling headphones</a>, and another for AirPods-style <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/audio/best-wireless-earbuds-2018-3673682/">true wireless headphones</a>.</p>
      <p>Please bear in mind that there are countless pairs of wireless headphones on the market so we can't feature them all. These are the best of the ones we have reviewed.</p>
      <h3>What to look for in wireless headphones</h3>
      <p>The biggest reason to buy wireless headphones is convenience. Not having to run a cable through your clothes to your phone - that ends up tugging all the time - is so much nicer.</p>
      <p>Some wireless headphones even come with NFC built-in to make it super easy to pair them with a smartphone – you don't need to do much more than tap them together. Apple doesn't allow the iPhone's NFC chip to be used for this, however.</p>
      <p>There are downsides to wireless headphones, of course, starting with the fact that sound quality won't be as good compared to a wired pair at the same price point. Look for pairs that support aptX, an audio codec that provides better wireless performance - though, again, this isn't supported on iPhones so you'll want something like AAC instead.</p>
      <p>Wireless technology requires power to work so that means a battery, which is going to make them heavier. This also means you'll need to remember to charge them up. While some wireless headphones can last a whopping 20-30 hours, some can only manage around three hours.</p>
      <p>Don't forget that using Bluetooth on your phone will also use more of your phone's battery power than plugging headphones in.</p>
      <p>If your wireless headphones do run out of power then you'll want to revert to the trusty old wire. Not all pairs offer this so check whether this is a feature; it's also handy if you want to use them with devices that don't have Bluetooth like the entertainment system on a plane or a Nintendo Switch - though gadgets like the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/audio/rha-wireless-flight-adapter-3702300/">RHA Wireless Flight Adapter</a> will let you connect to wired sources without the pesky wires.</p>
      <p>For many, the pros will outweigh the cons when it comes to wireless headphones and we hope you find the right pair below. We'll be looking to expand the list as we review more pairs. If you're not sure wireless is the way to go, make sure you read our best headphones chart for other options.</p>

        <p>Aside from slightly fiddly touch controls, there’s really very little to complain about from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-WH-1000XM3-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-Black/dp/B07GDR2PH9?ascsubtag=06-3661901-11-3693260">Sony's WH-1000XM3</a> - except maybe the awkward name. The noise cancellation is still absolutely unmatched, and it’s backed up audio that’s almost as good.</p>
        <p>Sony has merely tinkered with the rest of the design, rather than transforming it, keeping the understated aesthetic that’s served it so well so far, and despite the tighter fit than previous models these are still plenty comfortable for long-term listening.</p>
        <p>Throw in reliable Bluetooth connections, 30-hour battery life, and (joy of joys) USB-C charging, and these are basically the best wireless headphones around right now.</p>

          <p>At they're affordable price compared to the big name rivals out there, the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 wireless earbuds should be lacking in a few areas but they're really not.</p>
          <p>They might not have the most striking design but they're lightweight and comfortable. The buttons can handle a whole range of functions once you learn the system, too.</p>
          <p>More importantly, there's excellent battery life on offer here combined with top sound quality so what more could you want? Perhaps noise cancelling but not at this price.</p>

            <p>Simply put, the RHA TrueConnect are one of the best pairs of wireless earbuds we've tested.</p>
            <p>Although they don't have active noise cancelling like the Sony WF-1000X, the comfortable and efficient seal provides excellent noise isolation instead. This means they're cheaper and don't suffer from dropouts either.</p>
            <p>Add in a whopping 25 hours battery life via the charging case, IPX5 splash resistance and top-notch audio quality and this is the pair to beat.</p>

                <p>Aside from lacking Bluetooth 5.0 and AAC support, there's not really much to complain about when it comes to RHA's T20 Wireless in-ear headphones. They're a strong upgrade on the T20i headphones, offering a blend of wireless and wired support alongside incredible-sounding audio further enhanced by the inclusion of custom tuning filters that emphasise bass and treble. </p>
                <p>The 12-hour battery life isn't the longest we've ever seen from a pair of neckbuds, but when the battery does die, you can switch to a good old-fashioned wired connection which, as well as not requiring power, actually bumps the sound quality into high-res territory with a frequency range of 16-40,000Hz.</p>
                <p>Whether you're an audiophile or just someone looking for a great pair of neckbuds, you won't be disappointed with the RHA T20 Wireless headphones. </p>

                          <p>We do really like like Surface Headphones, even if we would prefer another colour or two instead of grey.</p>
                          <p>If you want comfortable headphones then these are definitely going to tick that box. There are other useful features like touch controls, automatic playback sensing, hands-free calls and really satisfying adjustment dials.</p>
                          <p>They sound pretty good, too, but they just don't reach the same heights as key rivals that are priced the same. </p>
