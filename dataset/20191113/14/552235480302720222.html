      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/rangersfc">Rangers fan</a> saved the life of his father when he suffered a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/heartattack">cardiac arrest</a> after leaving a game at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/ibroxstadium">Ibrox</a> .</p>
      <p>Karl Zimmerman used CPR on stricken 64-year-old after pulling him from their crashed car.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old had to crawl over Carl to free him as the vehicle had accelerated towards another car on a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow">Glasgow</a> roadside.</p>
      <p>With guidance from an ambulance call taker, Karl began giving CPR in a desperate bid to save him.</p>
      <p>Karl said: “I brought him back once and I will never forget it. He took a breath, and then I just kept going and going.”</p>
      <p>Doctors later warned Carl’s devastated family that he had only a six per cent chance of survival.</p>
      <p>But the grandad pulled through and now Karl has passed on his thanks to the Scottish Ambulance Service for their “amazing” support.</p>

      <p>Karl, a joiner from the city’s Govan, said: “We’d just been to see Rangers beat <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/livingston">Livingston</a> at Ibrox and were driving away from the ground.</p>
      <p>“It was crazy, pure luck – by the grace of God, his front headlight was out, he had pulled over and I was checking it.</p>
      <p>“When I came back he was unconscious at the wheel.</p>
      <p>“It was an automatic, and the car just started rolling into another car. I managed to turn the wheel and pull it into a hedge.</p>
      <p>“I then climbed over him and dragged him out of the car. I was a bit panicked.”</p>
      <p>Karl, who had learned first aid at work, started CPR. He added: “It was all a bit of a blur, instinct just kicked in. The 999 call taker talked me through it." </p>
      <p>Ambulance call taker Celeste Hill was put on loudspeaker on Karl’s phone while a couple passing by stopped to help relay instructions.</p>

      <p>Karl said: “They helped me as I continued doing CPR. The whole thing seemed like a minute, and then the ambulance response arrived. They were brilliant. </p>
      <p>“I could not believe how calm they were. I thought it was the most incredible thing I have ever seen – the ambulance response right through until the aftercare. </p>
      <p>“I only did what I had to do. I don’t think it was heroic. </p>
      <p>“If I hadn’t had the call taker speaking to me, I would’ve gone into panic mode.</p>
      <p>“I knew I had to do something. I knew he was not going to just wake up. Once the ambulance arrived, they took over, and took him into the ambulance.”</p>

      <p>Carl, also from Govan, praised his son’s actions.</p>
      <p>He said: “He was fantastic. The work of everyone was fantastic.</p>
      <p>“I cannot even remember the game to be honest. I cannot remember leaving Ibrox and I cannot remember watching the game.</p>
      <p>“Next time I woke up was five days later.”</p>
      <p>After months of recovery following the incident last November, the father and son met one of the attending crew members based at Kilmarnock Ambulance Station.</p>
      <p>Along with Karl’s daughter, Eva, eight, and Carl’s wife Christine, they thanked Martin Moore in person. </p>
      <p>Technician Martin said: “This incident puts into perspective the importance of good call handling, nearby resources and most importantly bystander CPR.”</p>
