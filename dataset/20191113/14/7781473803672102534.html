      <h1>Suzuki India likely to introduce six premium motorcycles and scooters in the next three years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:16:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Satoshi Uchida, managing director of Suzuki Motorcycle India acknowledged that the Indian two-wheeler market is an important space for the manufacturer. Out of all the two million two-wheelers sold in the country, Suzuki motorcycle contributed by selling 6,70,000 units in the last fiscal year.</p>

      <p>For now, the company has decided to focus more on higher-capacity, premium motorcycles to steer clear of the government's possible decision to ban the sale of two-wheelers under 150cc engine capacity in the future. This could mean the Indian market could get higher capacity scooters i.e the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/suzuki/burgman-m782/">Suzuki Burgman</a> Street 150. This also gives some weight to the rumours of <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/suzuki/v-strom-m734/">Suzuki V-Strom</a> 250 to be offered in India given that the adventure touring segment has received attention from many manufacturers, these include the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/royal-enfield/himalayan-m571/">Royal Enfield Himalayan</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/bmw/g-310-gs-m639/">BMW G 310 GS</a> and the soon expected KTM 390 Adventure.</p>

      <p>Suzuki also exports motorcycles to international markets. "We have a very big advantage on cost. If something is accepted in India, that means price-wise we can utilise it for the whole of the world," said Uchida. "Even Japan is eager to get more India-made models," he added. This means that higher capacity motorcycles such as the Suzuki V-Strom 650 XT and GSX-S750 could now be locally manufactured.</p>
      <p>Suzuki Motorcycle India recorded a growth in sales amidst the ongoing sales slowdown, however, Uchida expects the sales to take a slight dip because of the soon expected price hike in the BSVI era.</p>
      <p>Suzuki's Gurgaon facility can manufacture one million two-wheelers annually. Given the sales slowdown, the manufacturer has paused its plan to set up a second manufacturing plant. The plans are in the initial stages and the company is still looking for a land parcel for the second plant. The construction will begin once the market steadies, Uchida added.</p>
