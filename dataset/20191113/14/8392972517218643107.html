      <p>Cobbles legend Vicky Entwistle appeared in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/drama-tv/holby-city/">Holby City</a> this week, but sadly her character was killed off in the emotional episode.</p>
      <p>In Tuesday night's edition of the BBC medical drama (November 12 2019), Vicky played cancer patient Sandra Jackson.</p>
      <p>In upsetting scenes, Elliot was going over Sandra's results and asked if she wanted to continue without her husband, Frank, there.</p>
      <p>She told Elliot that she preferred Frank not to hear it as it was killing him as much as it was her.</p>

      <p>Elliott broke the news that her chemotherapy wasn't working and the cancer was spreading, but he also informed her there was a surgery that could be performed.</p>
      <p>Sandra was told she could have an operation to remove as much of the tumour as possible and have chemotherapy afterwards.</p>
      <p>During her time in the hospital, she also had a heart to heart with Jac about their children.</p>

      <p>Jac suggested to Sandra that there was an alternative surgery that would get rid of the cancer, but it was more risky.</p>
      <p>If the surgery was successful, she was to have a 90% chance of living another five years and wouldn't need chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>Sandra was told there was a high risk she wouldn't survive the surgery, though, but she wanted it so she could be around for her family and didn't want to have to go through having chemotherapy again.</p>
      <p>Before going into surgery, Sandra told Jac that her first grandchild was due next week and she told her family she would be there to meet them.</p>
      <p>But sadly during the surgery there were complications and Sandra passed away.</p>
