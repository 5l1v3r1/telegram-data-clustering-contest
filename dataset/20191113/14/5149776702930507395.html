      <h2>'Can you arrange for me to meet David Attenborough at Attenborough Nature Reserve?'</h2>

      <p>If you've ever felt naughty pocketing the toiletries following a hotel stay, or worried it was too cheeky to ask the reception for a tea and biscuits top up then stop!</p>
      <p>Instead, console yourself with the knowledge that this year one <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/how-every-travelodge-hotel-nottingham-2540471">Travelodge</a> guest asked staff if they could arrange a meet-and-greet with David Attenborough at Attenborough Nature Reserve.</p>
      <p>The quirky request is one of 10, revealed by the hotel chain, as some of the weirdest its Nottingham staff have dealt with over the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>Others include:</p>
      <p>"Where can I meet <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/robin-hood">Robin Hood</a>?"</p>
      <p>"Can you arrange for a white horse to take my son to his wedding?"</p>
      <p>"Can you call our Shanghai office and pretend to be me as they think I can speak Mandarin?"</p>
      <p>"Will I see the golden goose at the Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/goose-fair">Goose Fair</a>?".</p>

      <p>Travelodge spokeswoman, Shakila Ahmed, says there has also been a spike in guests asking staff for help with wedding proposals.</p>
      <p>"One customer asked for a unicorn pedal boat and for a rainbow to appear above the hotel at 4.16pm for a wedding proposal at Thurrock Travelodge," she says.</p>
      <p>"The team at Rhyl Travelodge were asked to set up a romantic candlelit dinner on Rhyl beach with a path of red rose petals from the hotel to the table.</p>

      <p>"At Leamington Spa Travelodge the hotel team were tasked to get a full moon outside the customer’s room window in order to create a moonlight setting.”</p>
      <p>The hotel chain annually welcomes around 19 million customers across 570 hotels, including three in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>Shakila says: "Our hotel teams receive thousands of interesting requests from business and leisure guests. Where possible, our hotel teams will go above and beyond to help customers as they relish a good challenge.</p>
      <p>"However there are some requests beyond their control, such as getting a raft of ducks to go to sleep, stopping the traffic on the M5, getting the Northern Lights to make an appearance and getting a herd of sheep as a sleep aid.”</p>
