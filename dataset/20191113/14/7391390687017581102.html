      <p>No matter what your plans look like, you don't want to miss out on the reading opportunity that a long holiday provides. Whether you're traveling to see family or prepared to hunker down at home, here are 11 <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/culture/new-books-to-read-thanksgiving-break">novels about family to read over the Thanksgiving break</a>, for when you just want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the holiday.</p>
      <p>I love food, cooking, and everything involved in a Thanksgiving meal, but <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/51767-10-talks-you-will-have-with-your-family-during-the-holidays-so-prepare-yourself-now">being trapped in a small space with my large family</a> can be a bit... <i>much</i>. Sometimes I need an escape, and reading about someone else's family is often just the ticket. Whether the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/why-you-dont-have-to-go-home-for-the-holidays-if-your-family-is-toxic-13261343">fictional moms, dads, aunts, and uncles make me feel more at home</a> than my real-life relatives, or they're just so awful that I feel thankful — 'tis the season — for the family I have, there's nothing like a good novel about family to cheer me up when the holiday stress arrives.</p>
      <p>Maybe your situation is different from mine, in that you <i>love</i> spending time with all of your loud and nosy relatives, or that you're not going home at all this Thanksgiving. Your feelings are valid, and I can almost guarantee that you'll still benefit from reading one of these <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/20-family-sagas-you-can-read-over-a-long-weekend-15568441">novels about family</a> over the Thanksgiving break.</p>

      <p>The first novel by an Omani woman to be translated into English, Jokha Alharthi's <i>Celestial Bodies</i> is also the first Arabic novel in translation to win the Man Booker International Prize.
