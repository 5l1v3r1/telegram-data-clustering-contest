      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-mail-ltd">Royal Mail</a> has won a High <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> injunction to block potential strikes by postal workers.</p>
      <p>The company brought legal action against the Communication Workers Union (CWU) after members voted to back walkouts by 97% on a turnout of 76%.</p>
      <p>At the outset of a ruling in London today, Mr Justice Swift said he had decided there should be an order for an injunction.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, Royal Mail claimed the union orchestrated a "de facto workplace ballot", contrary to rules on industrial action, to maximise the turnout and the "yes" vote.</p>
      <p>CWU lawyers argued there was no evidence of interference with the ballot and that "legitimate partisan campaigning" by the union in favour of a "yes" vote did not violate the rules.</p>

      <p>The CWU balloted members over strike action amid a dispute between workers and management over job security and employment terms.</p>
      <p>The union previously said the result of the ballot, which was open between September 24 and October 15, represented the largest "yes vote" for national industrial action since the passing of the Trade Union Act 2016.</p>
