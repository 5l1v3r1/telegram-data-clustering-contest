      <p>A couple <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder-trial">murdered</a> a homeless woman and disposed of her body in communal bins so they could spend her benefit payments, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Kevin Flanagan, 39, and Kathleen Salmond, 40, are said to have "callously" dumped Lisa Bennett's body in the bins.</p>
      <p>A court heard it was then incinerated at a community waste facility.</p>
      <p>Salmond, who is now "largely confined to a bed or a wheelchair", and Flanagan are accused of killing the 38-year-old woman after letting her stay with them at their then address in Weoley Castle, Birmingham.</p>
      <p>They then fraudulently claimed her benefits and spent the cash, jurors heard.</p>
      <p>"On Thursday May 9 2013, Lisa Bennett collected her daily Subutex prescription from the pharmacy in Selly Oak (an area of Birmingham)," prosecutor Simon Denison QC said at Birmingham Crown Court.</p>

      <p>"She was never seen or heard from again by anyone who cared for her - her mother, who was in regular contact with her, her friends, support workers, her doctor, the pharmacy. She vanished.</p>
      <p>"The two defendants reaped the benefit of Lisa's disappearance by withdrawing Lisa's benefit money from Kathleen Salmond's bank account and spending it for themselves.</p>
      <p>"When the police eventually came to question them about what had happened to Lisa, they each quite calmly said that she was alive and well - that she had asked them to transfer her benefits in Miss Salmond's account and to withdraw it for her - and that her new boyfriend, who they called Ian, would collect it from them each week for Lisa.</p>

      <p>"They were lying. Lisa Bennett was dead and her new boyfriend Ian didn't exist.</p>
      <p>"Lisa died in their flat on or around May 9 2013. Her body has never been found. She has no grave.</p>
      <p>"The prosecution case is that the defendants murdered her, and then callously disposed of her body in the communal bins opposite their flat, where it lay undiscovered before the bins were emptied and the contents were taken to the council waste disposal facility a few days later.</p>
      <p>"There, her body was incinerated with the community's waste.</p>
      <p>"The defendants then both pretended that she was alive so they could take her benefit money for themselves.</p>
      <p>"Even after the benefit payments were stopped, they continued the pretence, the lies, that she was alive and that her money had been collected by a man called Ian.</p>

      <p>"For years - years in which Lisa's mother Janet, her father Jim and her sister Lindsay needed to know what happened to her - they kept up that pretence and those lies."</p>
      <p>Salmond, of Hodge Hill, Birmingham, and Flanagan, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, deny murder.</p>
      <p>Salmond, who appeared by video link from a bed, also denies benefit fraud between May 8 and 31 2013, and preventing Miss Bennett's burial - charges which Flanagan has previously admitted.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
