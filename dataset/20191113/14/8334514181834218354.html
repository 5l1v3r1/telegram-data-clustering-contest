      <p>(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday unveiled a new MacBook Pro with a bigger screen and a better keyboard, replacing its 15-inch model.</p>
      <p>The new MacBook Pro will start at $2,399, comparable with the older model, and will be available from Wednesday on its online store and in U.S. retail stores later this week.</p>
      <p>The iPhone maker last revamped MacBook Pro in 2016 by adding a fingerprint reader and faster ports. The MacBook line accounts for about 10% of Apple’s total annual revenue of $260 billion.</p>
      <p>Apple said the new model will have a “Magic” keyboard that comes with a scissor mechanism delivering 1 millimeter of key travel and a stable key feel.</p>
      <p>Apple’s “butterfly” keyboards in older laptops have faced criticism for typing-related problems, including characters repeating unexpectedly, failing to appear, or keys that feel “sticky” and do not respond in a consistent manner.</p>
