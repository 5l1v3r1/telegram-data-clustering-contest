      <h2>Fitbit OS 4.1 brings new features to Versa 2 and other Fitbit smartwatches</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Jary</a></address>
      <p>Fitbit has updated its Fitbit OS operating system for its health smartwatches.</p>
      <p>Fitbit OS 4.1 is compatible with the company’s smartwatches, including the Versa 2 and Ionic, plus the original Versa and Versa Lite.</p>
      <p>It begins rolling out to Fitbit smartwatch users from the first week of December.</p>
      <p>The Versa 2, Fitbit’s latest smartwatch release, gets a new enriched always-on display mode (with five additional clock face options), expanded capabilities for its built-in Amazon Alexa voice assistant, and a new advanced heart rate algorithm that the company is hailing as “the best tracking yet he latest smartwatch tracker” - read our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smart-watches/fitbit-versa-2-3701517/">Fitbit Versa 2 review</a>.</p>
      <p>The new <b>PurePulse</b> heart-rate tracking algorithm uses machine learning to recognise the unique signature of heart rate in the optical sensor, leading to higher accuracy overall.</p>
      <p>Now in colour, the <b>Always On displays</b> feature full health and fitness stats, with faster transitions between always-on and active views on the AMOLED display, but reducing battery life from six days to just two – although that is still longer than the battery life of the Apple Watch even when not Always On.

      <p>OS 4.1 delivers <b>Smart Wake</b>, a silent on-device alarm that uses machine learning to wake you during an optimal time of your sleep cycle while in light or REM sleep within a 30-minute interval prior to the start of your set alarm.</p>

      <p>A new <b>Agenda app</b> will “help you take on the day to live your best life and help manage your daily schedule on-the-go”.</p>
      <p>A new <b>clock face switcher</b> lets you store up to five of your favourite clock faces from nearly 4,000 available in the Fitbit App Gallery directly on-device so you can quickly and easily swap clock faces. If you fancy counting, there are 3,275 clock faces available for the Ionic, 3,960 for the Versa2, 4,484 for the original Versa, and 3,615 for the Versa Lite.</p>
      <p>Talking of the Fitbit App Gallery, this gets a new five-star rating system - allowing users to rate and recommend their favourite apps and clock faces with the Fitbit user community.</p>
      <p>Versa 2 owners can now use Amazon Alexa to start any of the now 20 exercises from their wrist. For example, you can ask Alexa to start a run with Fitbit and automatically start tracking against your personal fitness goals and daily activities.</p>
      <p>Another feature promises to save energy and avoid losing step counting by notifying users when their <b>battery</b> is running low, and automatically disables select features to get you back home before the battery conks out. This is activated when battery reaches 8% remaining.
