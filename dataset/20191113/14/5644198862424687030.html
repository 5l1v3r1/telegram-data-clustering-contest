      <p>LONDON: A rare Chinese teapot sold at an auction on Monday (Nov 11) for £1 million (US$1.3 million) - about 1,000 times the original auction value, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-50387284">the BBC reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Auctioneers had valued the teapot between US$1,285 and US$2,570 but in just 10 minutes, it sold for about US$1.3 million, the BBC reported.</p>

      <p>The light green teapot, standing at 13cm, was described by Duke's Auctions as a "rare celadon-glaze pear-shaped teapot with a Qianlong seal mark". The seal is a mark of the Qianlong emperor who ruled China from 1736 to 1795, the BBC said.</p>
      <p>The lid of the teapot, which had minor damage, bears a peach and a pip - a symbol of immortality and unity in Imperial China, according to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/12/cracked-teapot-found-dorset-sells-1m-auctioneer-makes-accidental/">Telegraph</a>.</p>
      <p>The teapot was discovered during a routine valuation, the BBC reported, but it gained interest from "hundreds of collectors and dealers" at an exhibition.</p>
      <p>There was an "international bidding war" among 10 buyers for the teapot, the Telegraph said. The successful bidder offered US$1 million, before the auction house fees were taken into account.</p>
      <p>There was stunned applause in the auction house following the sale, said the Telegraph.</p>
      <p>The original owner of the teapot was unaware of its significance until an expert uncovered its value.</p>
