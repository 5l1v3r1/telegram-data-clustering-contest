      <p>Disney+ has altered the shoot out scene between Greedo and Han Solo, making this the third alteration over the years.</p>
      <blockquote>You can see the <a href="https://twitter.com/GarrettMcDowel1/status/1194236198774022144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=safari-reader%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2Fstarwars%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Fdisney-plus-star-wars-a-new-hope-greedo-scene-change%2F">footage</a> isnâ€™t as lightened as some previous editions. It does lean on the grainier look used in the 1977 reel, but it is longer overall. That is because an additional bit of dialogue was added to Greedo. Not only does the version make it more difficult to tell whether Greedo shot first, but it sees them shout something at Han Solo before being killed.</blockquote>
