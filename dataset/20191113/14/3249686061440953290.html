      <p>The fandom iKONICS which is called by many a small fandom has done their best to fight for their beloved seven boys. Despite being small has managed to trend several hashtags worldwide and most of all who could forget the iconic #CreditHanbin in which fans called out YG for not crediting Hanbin in his own work, only to find out later that he's not credited for not just one but two songs he worked hard on. Not just that, to add on fans celebrated Hanbin's birthday in the grandest way they can. </p>

      <p>Fans aren't giving up despite being tired, how could they when they're Hanbin's and iKON's seawall? Time and time again they have proven that they're not just fans who are their through the good times but rather a family that the boys could always lean on. Indeed one of the most loyal fandom out there. </p>
      <p>Hang in there iKONICS, the storm will be over soon and seven-colored rainbow will come through beautifully. </p>
