      <p>Awwwyeahhh! Hot on the heels of <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/11/13/apple-will-reportedly-reveal-the-16-inch-macbook-pro-any-day-now/">yesterday’s rumor</a>, Apple has actually launched the 16-inch MacBook Pro laptop.</p>
      <p>I don’t normally get excited for laptop updates, but the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a bit different. Why? Because the company has finally backtracked on <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/07/07/what-hell-apple-butterfly-keyboard-keys-design/">its awful butterfly keyboard</a> and has installed a new one with the far more reliable scissor mechanism instead.</p>
      <p>No, it’s not exactly the “new” keyboard Apple’s marketing would have you believe, but whatever. Thank fuck the butterfly nightmare is over… for the moment.</p>
      <p>The company refers to the, uh, “new” typing area as the Magic Keyboard, stating that it delivers “1mm of key travel” and a “stable” feel. Interestingly, Apple has also included a physical escape key next to the Touch Bar, which is good news for anyone who has struggled with its absence. Which is anyone who has used the Touch Bar.</p>

        <figcaption>It’s like manna from heaven.</figcaption>

      <p>Apple has also fiddled with the cooling system on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The company‘s re-engineering of this should, according to them, result in a “28 percent increase in airflow.” And it has made the heat sink “35 percent larger.”</p>
      <p>Time will tell about those statistics, but at the very least, the 16-inch MacBook Pro should be able to handle more intensive tasks than the previous generation.</p>
      <p>This is a good thing, because Apple has beefed up the specs with this laptop. It has new 8-core processors, which can run (with Turbo boost) up to speeds of 5.0 GHz. It can also be expanded to include a ridiculous 64GB of RAM — the first Apple laptop to achieve this.</p>
      <p>The company has also concentrated on the graphics this time around, opting for the AMD Radeon Pro 5000M series. There’s an 8GB VRAM option with the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which should please an awful lot of video professionals.</p>

        <figcaption>Mmmmmm, I know this isn’t video software, but it still looks cool.</figcaption>

      <p>Another feature that I like the look of is the ability to install an 8TB SSD in the 16-inch MacBook Pro. According to the company, this is the largest ever SSD to be jammed in a notebook. Will you need to remortgage your house to get this? Probably, as it’ll set you back an extra $2,200, <i>but just think of all the cool things you can store on it.</i></p>
      <p>The base model of the 16-inch MacBook Pro will set you back $2,399, but if you want the whole hog? With a 2.4GHz 8-core 9th-generation Intel Core i9 processor? And 64GB of RAM? And an 8TB SSD? That, friends, will set you back a cool $6,099. Nice.</p>
      <p>Anyway, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is one of the most interesting laptop updates Apple has made in the past couple of years. Hopefully, it shows the company is finally beginning to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/07/10/wish-apple-whole-assed-new-macbook-pro-air/">whole-ass its MacBooks at long last</a>, but I’m going to have to wait a few months to see if that holds true.</p>
      <p>Until then, this is a step in the right direction — even if, on a keyboard level at least, it’s a step backwards. In a good way.</p>
