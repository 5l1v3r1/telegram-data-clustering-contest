      <p>Machelle Hobson, 47, died at 10 a.m., according to Ricardo Alvarado, a public information officer for the Maricopa Police Department. A cause of death was not given.</p>
      <p>Hobson ran a YouTube channel known as "Fantastic Adventures" was facing charges of abusing and neglecting her seven adopted children while featuring them on her videos, the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/pinal-breaking/2019/11/12/youtube-mom-machelle-hobson-accused-child-abuse-dies-scottsdale-hospital/2583412001/">Arizona Republic</a> reported.</p>
      <p>According to court documents, Hobson was facing 29 charges, including multiple counts of child abuse, kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment.</p>
      <p>The Pinal County Attorney's Office told <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-northeast-valley/scottsdale/official-youtube-mom-machelle-hobson-dies-at-hospital-in-scottsdale">KNXV</a> they will continue to pursue Hobson's assets, which includes more than $100,000 in cash. The money will go to the children, who are now in the custody of the state, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Hobson in March after several of her adopted children claimed they were being starved, beaten and pepper-sprayed if the woman was unhappy with their performances on "Fantastic Adventures," the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/pinal-breaking/2019/11/12/youtube-mom-machelle-hobson-accused-child-abuse-dies-scottsdale-hospital/2583412001/">Republic</a> reported. The channel had a large following but was removed after Hobson's arrest, according to the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Hobson pleaded not guilty to the charges. In August, a judge declared her incompetent to stand trial, but restorable, the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/pinal-breaking/2019/11/12/youtube-mom-machelle-hobson-accused-child-abuse-dies-scottsdale-hospital/2583412001/">Republic</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Hobson's trial was temporarily stopped as prosecutors worked to restore Hobson to competency, according to the newspaper.</p>
