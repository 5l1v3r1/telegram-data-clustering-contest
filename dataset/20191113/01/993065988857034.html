      <p>A loyal order band which <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/08/14/news/unionist-leaders-meet-police-over-relief-of-derry-march-1684200/">caused outrage when members marched through Derry bearing Parachute Regiment and Soldier F insignia</a> in the summer will not take part in next month’s Lundy’s Day parade in the city.</p>
      <p>The Irish News understands members of the Clyde Valley flute band from Larne took the decision themselves not to take part in the Closing of the Gates parade on December 7.</p>
      <p>Police flanked the band as it paraded in the annual August Relief of Derry march after it was revealed that members were wearing uniforms bearing Parachute Regiment and Soldier F insignia.</p>
      <p>Soldier F <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/03/14/news/bloody-sunday-one-soldier-to-be-charged-with-murder-1572695/">is expected to be charged with the murders of William McKinney and Jim Wray</a> on Bloody Sunday. Legal arguments surrounding the possible charges are continuing and the case is expected to be raised at Derry Magistrate’s Court on December 4.</p>

      <p>The Larne band’s display caused uproar in Derry with business and political leaders condemning the move. Following the August march, Apprentice Boys’ governor, Graeme Stenhouse acknowledged the hurt caused. Mr Stenhouse said the focus of the Apprentice Boys’ parades was to commemorate the siege of Derry.</p>
      <p>He said: “We recognise that this may have caused upset to many in the nationalist community.”</p>

      <p>However, it emerged earlier this month that the band – named after a boat used in the UVF’s 1914 gun-running operation – was expected to take part in the Apprentice Boys December march. Thousands of loyal order members take part in the annual parade which commemorates the start of the 1689 siege and culminates with the burning of a huge effigy of siege leader, Lundy, considered a traitor by unionists.</p>
      <p>There were fears that the band’s display in August and any participation in next month’s march could jeopardise a long-standing agreement which has ensured Apprentice Boys’ parades pass off peacefully. The agreement – known as the 'Derry model' – was negotiated through the city’s business community following serious violence surrounding Apprentice Boys’ marches in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>While the Apprentice Boys’ have yet to formally submit their official 11/1 notice to the Parades Commission, it is understood members of the Clyde Valley flute band decided not to take part in the parade. A source told the Irish News members took the decision to ease tensions.</p>
