      <p>THE weather played havoc with the Ulster Schools' GAA and camogie fixtures yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Danske Bank Mageean Cup semi-final between Cross and Passion, Ballycastle and St Killian's, Garron Tower was postponed and will take place this afternoon with a 2pm throw-in at Dunsilly.</p>
      <p>And Dunsilly will also host the second semi-final between St Mary's CBGS and St Louis, Ballymena tomorrow (Thursday) at 2.30pm, with the final scheduled for Friday week (November 22) at the Dub.</p>
      <p>The first Leonard Cup semi-final between St Patrick's, Maghera and St Killian's was a victim of the weather as well. No re-fix date is sorted yet, but the other semi-final between St Louis, Ballymena and Cross and Passion, Ballycastle goes ahead on Friday in Cloughmills, 2.30pm.</p>
      <p>And football was also hit with the postponement of the Danske Bank MacRory Cup game between Omagh CBS and St Ronan's, Lurgan due to be played in Pearse Óg, Armagh. No re-fix date has yet been agreed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the MacRory Cup game between holders St Michael's, Enniskillen and St Colman's, Newry which was called off last Saturday is now planned for this Friday at Clones.</p>
      <p>There are three other MacRory Cup games scheduled before then.</p>
      <p>Abbey CBS and Patrician, Carrickmacross will play at 2pm today in Silverbridge, while both second round games in Group A are scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Both St Macartan's, Monaghan and Inis Eoghain are in search of a first win in the earlier game with a venue not yet confirmed, while Owenbeg will host St Patrick's Academy, Dungannon against Cathair Dhoire.</p>
      <p>Both Danske Bank Corn na nÓg semi-finals are scheduled for Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Hotly-tipped St Patrick's, Maghera are in action against St Colman's, Newry while Omagh CBS play St Macartan's, Monaghan. In both cases however a venue has still to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in camogie the Liatroim Fontenoys semi-final replay between Loreto, Coleraine and St Killian's, Garron Tower was postponed yesterday and is likely to be re-scheduled for Monday next.</p>
      <p>Camogie's Corn Eimhear final, a repeat of last year's decider between Cross and Passion, Ballycastle and Our Lady's and St Patrick's, Knock has been set for tomorrow evening in Drumanee, Bellaghy with a 5.30pm throw-in.</p>
      <p>The Junior Medallion Shield final, a Newry derby between Sacred Heart and Our Lady's, has been rescheduled for this Sunday</p>
      <p>Danske Bank Casement Cup quarter-final: St Patrick's, Downpatrick 2-12 St Mary's, Magherafelt 2-12 (AET) (St Patrick's won 3-1 on penalties)</p>
      <p>THERE was yet another penalty shoot-out yesterday, but a first in Ulster Schools' hurling when St Patrick's, Downpatrick scored with three strikes from outside the 20m line and goalie Rossa McGrath emerged hero with two stops at the Dub yesterday.</p>
      <p>Downpatrick were the dominant team for most of the scheduled 60 minutes and with a goal from Tom McGrattan, son of former All-star Gerard, they had build a decent lead midway through the second half.</p>
      <p>However St Mary's rallied with goals from midfielder Ronan McKenna and Ronan Kalla in the final ten minutes and they pushed the game into extra time, 1-11 to 2-8 with a late free from McKenna.</p>
      <p>Although McGrattan scored a second goal and added a point in extra time, McKenna tapped over four frees and the game went to a penalty shoot-out with the Down side holding their collective nerve to claim a semi-final against Our Lady's and St Patrick's, Knock.</p>
      <p>St Patrick's: Tom McGrattan (2-7), EoinMagee (0-2), Matthew McCabe (0-1), Fearghal MacManus (0-1), Mark Dorrian (0-1)</p>
      <p>St Mary's: Ronan McKenna (1-9), Ronan Kalla (1-1), Joshua Higgins (0-1), John McAlister (0-1).</p>
