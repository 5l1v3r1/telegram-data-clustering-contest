      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:45:54+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:45</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Carol Vorderman has spoken about how Queen singer Freddie Mercury used to write letters to Countdown, which was one of his "guilty pleasures."</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old former star of the Channel 4 show has shared her memories of the legendary front man as he reminisced about the days she would receive fan letters from him.</p>
      <p>It had been revealed recently that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/freddie-mercurys-guilty-pleasures-included-20845414">Freddie was a keen fan of the show</a> from the moment it heralded the start of Channel 4's existence.</p>
      <p>Freddie's best friend, Peter Freestone, had told Express Online that the Queen singer would be "at home alone with us would be sitting in a mismatched tracksuit on the sofa watching Countdown."</p>

      <p>He added that Carol's maths question was not his favourite part but that didn't stop him writing in to her.</p>
      <p>Peter said: “He hated numbers, he wasn’t a fan of that part. He always said, ‘Darling other people can worry about them’.”</p>
      <p>Since it was revealed about Freddie's love of the show, Carol has paid tribute to the beloved singer, who died in 1991 from bronchial pneumonia after being diagnosed as having HIV.</p>
      <p>Speaking out on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Carol posted a tribute to the late singer and shared her memories of the 'lost letters' she used to receive..</p>
      <p>Carol tweeted: “In today’s papers, a story about how the amazing Freddie Mercury loved to watch Richard and I on Countdown.</p>
      <p>“I know he did. He used to write occasionally which we loved.</p>
      <p>“I’m so touched to be reminded of those days Thank you @dailymirror @dailyexpressuk.”</p>

      <p>She was then asked by a fan: “Did you keep any of his letters Carol?”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Carol was unable to keep them personally. She replied: "Sadly they were in the office files and I don’t know what happened…a long time ago now xx.”</p>
      <p>When asked if it was ever revealed on air that Freddie was a fan of the show, Carol said that another legend had also sent in fanmail.</p>

      <p>She tweeted: “Once or twice I think. Sir @AnthonyHopkins also wrote in and we loved that too.</p>
      <p>“Well he is a total legend…and we were just in our little happy studio bumbling along loving words and numbers in Leeds. Happy days.”</p>
      <p>Carol appeared on Countdown from its first show in 1982 until 2008 and will forever be remembered as an icon of the show.</p>
      <p>The TV personality recently helped celebrate 20 years of Pride of Britain Awards by once again hosting the moving ceremony.</p>
