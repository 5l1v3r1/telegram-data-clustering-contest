      <h1>Gilbert Melendez releases statement following UFC release, says he left the promotion ‘on great terms’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, it was announced that former two-time Strikeforce lightweight champion Gilbert Melendez <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20960265/ufc-releases-former-strikeforce-champion-gilbert-melendez-mma-news">had been released from the UFC</a>.</p>
      <p>Melendez, who fought Benson Henderson for the UFC lightweight title back in 2013, is on a five-fight losing streak and hasn’t won a fight since UFC 166, which saw ‘El Nino’ beat Diego Sanchez in a <i>Fight of the Night</i> classic at Houston’s Toyota Center. Melendez tested positive for ‘for exogenous origin of testosterone metabolites’ in 2015 and was suspended for one year.</p>
      <p>Following his release, Melendez issued the following statement to <a href="https://twitter.com/bokamotoESPN/status/1194089606251188225">ESPN</a>, where he claimed to have left the UFC on great terms.</p>
      <p>“It was a fun ride with the UFC that I really enjoyed,” Melendez said. “I feel I gave them one of the most entertaining fights in their history (against Diego Sanchez), and I appreciate all they’ve done. They have done a bunch of cool stuff for all of their fighters.</p>
      <p>“That said, I do feel this release is mutual. I was ready to move on. I feel like, if I were to fight again, I would like to do it on my terms and steer my own ship. The UFC is a fantastic organization, but they have their agenda, and unless you’re a champion or a super strong needle mover, you don’t have as much say in your career. If I do get back in the cage, I want it to be with a company that agrees with the path that I want to be on. But I’m leaving the UFC on great terms”.</p>

      <p>With Melendez now a free agent, expect the MMA veteran to sign with either Bellator MMA or ONE FC.</p>
