      <p>PYEONGTAEK, Nov 13 — Seoul's decision to terminate a key military intelligence sharing pact with Japan risks sending the “wrong message” to adversaries, the commander of US troops in South Korea said ahead of the deal's expiration next week.</p>
      <p>Seoul and Tokyo are both major US allies, democracies and market economies faced with an overbearing China and nuclear-armed North Korea.</p>
      <p>But their relationship continues to be heavily affected by Japan's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945.</p>
      <p>The latest manifestation of their dispute over wartime history has escalated into a conflict over trade in the wake of South Korean court rulings against Japanese companies.</p>
      <p>As part of the row, South Korea said in August it will end the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) when it expires at midnight on November 22.</p>
      <p>The 2016 deal — which enables the two to exchange military secrets, particularly over North Korea's nuclear and missile capacity — had sent a “clear message” to the region that they were putting stability and security before their “historical differences,” said General Robert Abrams, commander of US Forces Korea.</p>
      <p>“And without that, there is a risk of sending the wrong message that perhaps we're not as strong,” Abrams told reporters yesterday at his Camp Humphreys headquarters in Pyeongtaek, around 60 kilometres south of Seoul.</p>
      <p>Abrams leads the 28,500 troops the US stations in the South, a treaty ally, to defend it against its nuclear-armed neighbour. The North's invasion of the South in 1950 triggered the Korean war.</p>
      <p>US diplomats say privately that the poor relations between Seoul and Tokyo complicate diplomacy in the region.</p>
      <p>South Korean officials have said they will continue sharing military intelligence with Tokyo through a trilateral channel with the US as the intermediary — but that has raised concerns over delays in urgent situations.</p>
      <p>Abrams, who also serves as the commander of the UN Command and the South Korea-US Combined Forces Korea, assumed his post in November last year in the wake of a rapid diplomatic rapprochement with Pyongyang and has rarely spoken to the media.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks and months the North has carried out a series of rocket launches, which he said were “not contributing to a continued air of detente on the Korean peninsula.”</p>
      <p>“We take every one of those very seriously to determine capabilities, limitations and intent,” Abrams added.</p>
      <p>Negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington have been gridlocked since the Hanoi summit between leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump broke up in February without an agreement.</p>
      <p>The pair met again at Panmunjom in the Demilitarised Zone in June to try to restart the process, but working-level talks in Stockholm broke up last month and contact has since been minimal, with Pyongyang demanding the US come up with a new offer by the end of the year. — AFP</p>
