      <p>(CN) – With just a handful of ballots left to count and the victory of a socialist incumbent, the race for Seattle City Council has a decisive loser: Amazon and its $1 million bid to install a council more friendly to big business.</p>
      <p>Last year, the City Council passed a per-employee tax on the state’s largest employers to pay for affordable housing and its fight against homelessness. About 500 companies grossing $20 million or more per year would have paid approximately 14 cents per hour worked by each employee – which after five years would add up to over $45 million.</p>
      <p>Amazon, Starbucks and the Downtown Seattle Association fought the tax and, two weeks later, the council voted 7-2 to repeal it. Ahead of the Nov. 5 election, the tech giant dumped over $1 million into the race in a bid to remove progressive council members and back candidates that would make the City Council much more friendly to big business.</p>
      <p>But the Amazon-led attempt to unseat progressive council members such as Lisa Herbold and Kshama Sawant and to fight Tammy Morales backfired, resulting in a City Council that is even more progressive than the one that preceded it.</p>
      <p>One week after the election, not every vote has yet been tallied. But clear winners and losers have emerged – especially one would-be influencer, according to Travis Ridout, professor of politics at Washington State University.</p>
      <p>“Amazon lost,” Ridout said in a phone interview. “It’s not all that surprising. As a company, they’re very polarizing, just like we’re polarized on a national level. It gave opponents a bogeyman of sorts. I suspect they’ll be more hesitant to go into a City Council race like this one in the future.”</p>
      <p>Tuesday afternoon’s tally of another batch of mail-in ballots left just 1,800 to be counted in King County, home to Seattle. The results were clear: out of nine council seats, seven had been in play during last Tuesday’s election. Only two candidates backed by Amazon are ahead.</p>
      <p>“Money does not buy an election,” Ridout said. “I think we already knew that.”</p>
      <p>One of the most striking results was the late surge in mail-in ballots for socialist incumbent Kshama Sawant. Initially trailing Amazon-funded Egan Orion, Sawant finished Tuesday afternoon with nearly 52% of the vote. Over the weekend, she declared the race over.</p>
      <p>In her victory speech at the Langston Hughes Performing Arts Institute in Seattle, Sawant called the results “a repudiation on the billionaire class” and promised a new head tax on Amazon and other big businesses.</p>
      <p>She added that the voters told Amazon that Seattle politics are not for sale.</p>
      <p>“The great American abolitionist Frederick Douglas said, ‘If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will,’” Sawant told supporters.</p>
      <p>But Ridout suggested there is still a way for Amazon to have the influence it sought.</p>
      <p>“What if they had donated to every City Council member as a way to say, you know what? We’re going to work with you, whatever the outcome,” Ridout said. “Amazon still has a lot of political power in Seattle, but it may be a political power that is working more in the background.”</p>
