      <h1>'Murdered' Grace Millane's woodland grave where body was found in muddy suitcase</h1>
      <h2>Grace Millane's alleged killer is said to have stuffed her body in the suitcase before burying it in bushland in Auckland, New Zealand.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:15:20+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:15</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Stephen D'Antal, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>The shallow grave where Grace Millane's naked body was found stuffed inside a suitcase after she was allegedly murdered have been shown to a court.</p>
      <p>Jurors were shown images of the moment detectives found the suitcase in a wooded area outside Auckland where she had been on a Tinder date.</p>
      <p>Police tracked down the burial site through the movements of the 27-year-old defendant’s phone, which led them to a lay-by about 10 miles west of the city.</p>
      <p>Police and forensic experts have already told the court how the shallow grave was found about 15 yards from the road.</p>
      <p>Grace's body was naked, but intact, in a foetal position.</p>
      <p>The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is currently on trial for murdering the British backpacker, although he claims she died by accident during rough sex.</p>
      <p>An elaborate web of lies concocted by the accused collapsed when he was confronted by a photograph of himself entering his hotel with a suitcase, Auckland High Court heard today.</p>

      <p>Video of the suspect’s first police interview was played to the jury at the man’s murder trial in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>For more than an hour, he gave an account packed with details of how he said he had spent the night of his Tinder date with Grace five days before.</p>
      <p>With a photograph of the young university graduate, then being treated as a missing person, on the table in front of him, he said he had said goodbye to Grace with “a hug and a kiss on the cheek”, hoping to see her the next day to celebrate her 22nd birthday.</p>

      <p>Then, he told Detective Sergeant Ewen Settle, he had gone to meet a work colleague but ended up drinking himself into a stupor in a pub and waking up in his apartment the next day believing he had been carried in by the concierge.</p>
      <p>He was a heavy drinker at weekends, he said, when he tended to “go crazy”, and after sharing cocktails with Grace he had gone to a bar and drunk 10 glasses of Tui beer, paid for in cash, and treated 20 other people to drinks.</p>
      <p>He said he woke up the next morning, had “a bit of a vomit” looked at his phone and saw it was 10am. He had tried to text Grace on Tinder the next day but she had unmatched him.</p>

      <p>Later that morning he had gone for “a scotch fillet, medium rare, with mushrooms, chips and salad” for breakfast before having a nap and going to meet a friend from work, he told DS Settle.</p>
      <p>The detective told him the search for Grace, whose parents had reported her missing the previous day, was ongoing and he asked if the alleged killer would give a voluntary DNA sample.</p>
      <p>The man responded: “100 per cent. I know I haven’t done anything wrong so I’m happy to do it.”</p>
      <p>DS Settle said: “We are very, very concerned for her safety. She might be dead and it could be that you’ve done it."</p>

      <p>The jury of seven women and five men watched, however, as instead of proceeding with the DNA sample, DS Settle told him minutes later: “We have reached a point where we have to advise you of your rights.”</p>
      <p>He showed the man a photograph of him entering the CityLife hotel, where he lived, at 8.15am on the Sunday with a suitcase he had bought that morning and told him: “You haven’t told the truth. You’ve told a lie.”</p>
      <p>The man said: “I’m being truthfully honest with you, I’ve still got that bag in my room.</p>

      <p>“I might have got the times wrong but if you are assuming I was using that suitcase for something I’ve still got it in my room and you guys can have it.</p>
      <p>“It came from The Warehouse [a chain store]. I bought it that day because I was having to move all the stuff out of my room.”</p>
      <p>The man said he had to remove all his blankets and pillows and belongings.</p>

      <p>In fact, the trial has heard, he used the suitcase to take Grace’s body in a hire car to remote, dense woodland where he buried it in a shallow grave early on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The Crown say he bought a second, identical suitcase which was left in his room at CityLife.</p>
      <p>He is accused of strangling Grace, from Wickford in Essex, during sex before watching a string of hardcore pornographic videos on his mobile phone.</p>
      <p>The man says she died accidentally after asking him to choke her during sex to increase her enjoyment.</p>

      <p>After the footage of the man’s interview, the jury saw CCTV footage which showed him on Sunday morning buying the suitcase, cleaning equipment and going for another Tinder date on Sunday afternoon, as Grace lay dead at CityLife.</p>
      <p>Her body was discovered a week after her death when police tracked the man’s cellphone movements.</p>
      <p>He denies murder.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
