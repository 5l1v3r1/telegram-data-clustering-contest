      <h1>NDP blasts 'immigration scam at the GTH' after ministry drops mega-mall from program</h1>
      <h2>The Saskatchewan government has changed immigration rules to exclude investments in the controversial Global Trade and Exhibition Centre from a special program to attract foreign entrepreneurs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:22:06+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>The Saskatchewan government has changed immigration rules to exclude investments in the controversial Global Trade and Exhibition Centre (GTEC) from a special program to attract foreign entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>NDP leader Ryan Meili said during question period Tuesday that the decision is tantamount to an admission that the GTEC is “an immigration scam at the GTH.”</p>
      <p>The GTEC has been at the centre of allegations that its developer, Brightenview Development International, misled Chinese nationals into buying spots in a mega-mall in the Global Transportation Hub by touting it as a quick and risk-free path to permanent residency with few strings attached.</p>
      <p>Recent reporting by CBC’s Geoff Leo pointed to a woman who saw her immigration application denied despite those assurances, and who was unable to recover a pricey deposit on the GTEC unit.</p>
      <p>In the midst of his reporting, the provincial government told Leo that it had cancelled eligibility under that program for the GTEC and similar “multi-business retail condo” projects.</p>
      <p>Under fire from Meili, Immigration and Career Training Minister Jeremy Harrison confirmed that decision during question period on Tuesday. But he said it followed months of consideration and review of the program by ministry staff.</p>
      <p>The changes affect the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program, which eases the path to permanent residency for certain kinds of immigrants the provincial government selects. The entrepreneur stream of the program is meant to attract immigrants who invest in eligible businesses and reside in the province.</p>
      <p>Multi-business retail condos and business incubators are now on a list of ineligible businesses that also includes co-operatives, home-based businesses and property rental activities.</p>
      <p>Harrison told reporters that the decision was made based on evidence that the model used by the GTEC was not as successful as other alternatives.</p>
      <p>He pointed to the fact that approvals are required from both the federal and provincial government for applicants planning to locate at the facility to explain why the model presented a higher risk.</p>
      <p>“We weren’t setting up newcomers in this business model for success in the way that we could have been in another sort of scenario,” he said.</p>
      <p>Harrison also noted that the GTEC model didn’t integrate immigrants into the local economy in the same way as other options.</p>
      <p>He wouldn’t comment on whether, in his view, prospective immigrants were misled or defrauded through the GTEC arrangement.</p>
      <p>“There probably is going to be litigation from tenants that would be coming out of that towards companies,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Meili noted that the government has been closely linked to the GTEC project from its inception, and has only changed its tune in light of negative publicity.</p>
      <p>“They boasted repeatedly about the project. Only now when they’re caught, do they come around to change things,” said Meili. “What will be done to help those who are damaged by this?”</p>
      <p>He said that the government must have known about concerns over Brightenview’s practices. If it didn’t, he believes it was wilful blindness.</p>
      <p>“If they weren’t, it was deliberate, because they had every chance to look closely,” said Meili. “These stories have emerged a number of times over the years of people… being led astray by that company.”</p>
