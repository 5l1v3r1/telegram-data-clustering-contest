      <p>As with previous Turkey Day Activity Challenges, the 2019 event requires users participate in a workout with a length of at least 5 kilometers, or 3.1 miles. The return of Apple's Thanksgiving Day challenge was discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/kylesethgray/status/1194409233573269504?s=20">Kyle Seth Gray</a>, who subsequently posted the information on Twitter.<br/><br/>"Keep active this Thanksgiving! Earn this special award on November 28 by doing any walk, run, or wheelchair workout of at least 5K (3.1mi)," Gray's tweet reads. <br/><br/>Apple introduced an activity challenge celebrating the popular U.S. holiday <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/11/21/apple-issues-5k-thanksgiving-day-activity-challenge-to-apple-watch-wearers">in 2016</a>, and followed it up with an identical event <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/11/23/surviving-thanksgiving-fight-to-keep-those-extra-pounds-off-with-these-fitness-apps">in 2017</a>. For reasons unknown, the company elected to forego the challenge in 2018.<br/><br/>Like past Thanksgiving Day badges, the 2019 version features a holiday themed design complete with turkey feathers and text denoting the completion of a 5K workout.<br/><br/><a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/apple+watch">Apple Watch</a> activity challenges are held throughout the year to mark special occasions, holidays and other world or country-specific events, the most recent of which landed on Veterans Day on Monday.</p>
