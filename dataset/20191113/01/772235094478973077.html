      <p><b>Toyota Australia</b> has been forced to <b>stop sales</b> of its <b>front-wheel drive RAV4 Cruiser</b> <b>SUV</b>, after discovering some examples have been <b>delivered with the wrong wheels</b>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>UPDATE - 2:00pm 13/11/2019: </b>Toyota has provided additional detail about how owners of RAV4 Cruiser two-wheel drive vehicles with the wrong wheels fitted can have the problem rectified. The story has been updated with those details.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The sales halt applies to <b>436 examples</b> of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/rav4/">RAV4 Cruiser</a> two-wheel drive petrol, which have been fitted with <b>18-inch wheels</b> from the GXL instead of the 19-inch units promised by <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/">Toyota</a> (pictured above).</p>
      <p>Toyota says some of the affected vehicles have already been delivered to customers, while those still with dealers won't be sold until the correct wheels are fitted.</p>
      <p>"A small number of RAV4 2WD petrol Cruiser vehicles were incorrectly fitted with 18-inch wheels instead of 19-inch wheels. Toyota is aware of the situation, and we are working with all impacted customers to rectify the situation," a Toyota spokesperson told <i>CarAdvice.</i></p>
      <p>Toyota will offer owners a $1500 EFTPOS card if they're happy to keep their car with the incorrect wheels. Alternatively, owners can choose to have a new car delivered with the correct wheels.</p>

      <p>This is the second time Toyota has been forced to stop RAV4 sales this year. In June, the company put a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/767987/toyota-rav4-hybrid-sales-halted/">sales halt on hybrid models</a> over a problem with the car's regenerative braking system. Affected models were <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/778538/toyota-my19-hybrid-brake-recall/">recalled late in June to have the issue fixed</a>.</p>
      <p>Buyers currently face a six-month wait for the top-selling RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid, but that hasn't stopped the RAV4 selling strongly in 2019.</p>
      <p>It's sitting on 19,732 sales year-to-date according to VFACTS data and topped the medium SUV class in October, outselling the second-placed <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a> by 424 units.</p>
      <p>Despite a declining overall market and a 1.8 per cent drop in medium SUV sales, reported registrations of the RAV4 have grown 6.7 per cent in 2019.</p>
