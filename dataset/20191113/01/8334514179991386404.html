      <p>The 38-year-old Baldelli is the youngest person to win the top manager honor. The Twins went 101-61 and won the AL Central title under Baldelli in his first season on the job.</p>
      <p>“What I can say is nobody takes on the responsibility of working in baseball or doing a job like this for personal accolades,” Baldelli said in an interview after the announcement. “I do everything that I can but it doesn’t matter necessarily. You need an entire group.”</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old Shildt is the first manager of the year winner to not have professional playing experience. His Cardinals won the NL Central with a 91-71 record.</p>
      <p>“My personal goal was to play in the big leagues and I got to college at UNC Asheville and realized that was not going to happen,” Shildt said after earning the honor. “I was a below-average college player and I set my sights on being the best coach I could be and the journey has led me here.”</p>
      <p>Shildt won the NL award despite receiving fewer first-place votes (10) than runner-up Craig Counsell (13) of the Milwaukee Brewers. But Shildt received 14 second-place votes to Counsell’s six to win the award by seven points, 95 to 88.</p>
      <p>Atlanta Braves manager Brian Snitker (45) received three third-place votes while finishing third. Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers received four first-place votes and placed fourth with 25 points. Dave Martinez (15) of the Washington Nationals was fifth.</p>
      <p>In the AL, Baldelli and runner-up Aaron Boone of the New York Yankees each received 13 first-place votes. But Baldelli also received 13 second-place votes for 106 points to outdistance Boone by 10. Boone received nine second-place votes.</p>
      <p>The Tampa Bay Rays’ Kevin Cash (33) received three first-place votes while finishing third. Bob Melvin of the Oakland Athletics was fourth with 19 points and the Houston Astros’ A.J. Hinch had 12 points. Hinch received one first-place vote.</p>
      <p>Minnesota smacked a major league record 307 homers in Baldelli’s debut season.</p>
      <p>It was just the second 100-win campaign in the franchise’s 59-season Minnesota era behind the 1965 Twins (102-60). Baldelli’s win total was 23 higher than the team’s 2018 output.</p>
      <p>He joins Tom Kelly (1991), Ron Gardenhire (2010) and Paul Molitor (2017) as Twins managers to win the honor.</p>
      <p>Baldelli is just the second AL manager to win the award in his first full season. Jeff Banister of the Texas Rangers was the first in 2015.</p>
      <p>Boone guided the Yankees to a 103-59 record and the AL East crown while winning 100 or more games for the second straight season. He worked around a number of injuries throughout the season, a list that included lengthy stints for outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, third baseman Miguel Andujar, starting pitcher Luis Severino and reliever Dellin Betances among several others.</p>
      <p>New York slugged 306 homers, one behind Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Cash led the Rays to a 96-66 record and an AL wild-card berth. The club flirted with 100 wins despite being without 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell for nearly two months due to elbow surgery.</p>
      <p>Shildt joins Whitey Herzog (1985) and Tony La Russa (2002) as St. Louis managers to win the award.</p>
      <p>Shildt’s Cardinals were 44-45 after a loss on July 12 but recovered to win the division. Shildt wanted little of the credit that comes with winning the top managing award.</p>
      <p>“This is an organization award, this is a team award, this is really a players award,” Shildt said. “My job is not to win an individual award. ... I accept it graciously on the behalf of our players and our staff and our front office and ownership. It is an amazing blessing.”</p>
      <p>Counsell guided the Brewers to an 89-73 record and an NL wild-card berth. He oversaw a 20-4 stretch to begin September as the club prospered despite the late season loss of star Christian Yelich due to a fractured kneecap.</p>
      <p>Counsell was NL runner-up for the second straight season.</p>
      <p>Snitker finished with a 95-67 record while guiding the Braves to the NL East title. He won NL Manager of the Year honors last season when Atlanta went 90-72.</p>
