      <p>TWO award-winning business leaders are to be honoured today alongside hundreds of graduates.</p>
      <p>Belfast Metropolitan College is making honorary fellowship awards to the founder and financial services firm FinTrU, Darragh McCarthy, and chair of Invest Northern Ireland, Rose Mary Stalker.</p>
      <p>More than 1,500 graduates and guests are expected to attend two higher education ceremonies on Wednesday in Titanic Belfast, where the honorary fellows will receive their awards.</p>
      <p>Belfast Met offers a selection of higher education courses that are closely aligned with industry demand and run in conjunction with top education providers in Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>They include course that will help fill the `skills gap', such as foundation degrees and Higher National Diplomas.</p>
      <p>College students typically benefit from significantly less costs for their qualification than universities/</p>
      <p>This year, students will graduate from the schools of Creative &amp; Digital Industries; Health, Wellbeing &amp; Inclusion; Science, Engineering &amp; Construction, and the Belfast Business School.</p>
      <p>Rose Mary Stalker is an experienced business leader. A Fellow of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, she is the recipient of numerous awards, including the European Woman of Achievement in Business.</p>
      <p>Darragh McCarthy founded FinTrU in 2013. It has gone on to become a multi award-winning company that employs 400 people in Belfast and Derry.</p>
