      <p>A pregnant 16-year-old was shot by unknown motorcycle-riding assailants yesterday after she appeared in court in Cagayan de Oro City.</p>
      <p>The suspects drove up and <a href="https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1831684">shot the teenager</a>, who is five months pregnant, in the right side of the neck as she was crossing the road with her mother and grandmother near the Hall of Justice on Mastersons Avenue at about 9am,<i> SunStar Cagayan de Oro</i> reports. Her mother and grandmother tried to run after the assailants, but the motorcycle quickly sped away.</p>
      <p>One witness, named Nestor Casiño, <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/12/19/buntis-na-teenager-sugatan-sa-pamamaril-sa-cdo">told</a> <i>ABS-CBN News, </i>“We saw her lying on the side of the road so we quickly called a patrol car to bring her to the hospital.”</p>
      <p>The victim is critically injured and remains in the hospital.</p>
      <p>The teen <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/balitambayan/promdi/715228/16-anyos-na-buntis-na-inireklamo-ng-pambabastos-ang-isang-pulis-binaril-sa-cdo/story/">appeared in court</a> to attend a hearing in connection with a “lasciviousness,” or molestation, case she filed against a police officer, news television show “Saksi” reported.</p>
      <p>Authorities are still looking for the perpetrators, who used a red and white motorcycle in the attack. They are also investigating the cop who was sued by the victim to find if he had anything to do with the crime.</p>
