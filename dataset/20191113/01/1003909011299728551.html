      <h1>2020 budget: City tax scenarios include cuts to police and fire, loss of 236 jobs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:28:53+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:28</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>City council got its first glimpse Tuesday of some big changes that could be in store for next year’s municipal budget.</p>
      <p>Council initially approved a 3.03 per cent tax hike on homeowners in 2020 as part of the previously approved four-year budget — but council members have since signalled that they could be pushing for a budgetary freeze and cuts to services in the year ahead.</p>
      <p>The budget debate comes as Calgary continues to grapple with the economic pain of depressed property values in the downtown <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/nenshi-defends-councils-record-calls-ucp-cuts-to-police-funding-surprising">and significant cuts in funding</a> to municipalities from the new provincial government.</p>
      <p>City staff revealed Tuesday that eliminating the 2020 tax increase entirely would have big implications for already stretched municipal budgets.</p>
      <p>A zero-per-cent tax increase would mean monthly savings of $5.10 for the average home, but would result in an $8.45-million cut to police budgets and the elimination of 236 full-time jobs at the city, and potential further job losses for the Calgary Police Service. The job-reduction figures include the elimination of vacant positions as well as layoffs, city staff clarified Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“The biggest challenge with zero is that it means a pretty big cut to the police service,” said Mayor Naheed Nenshi. “There’s no other way to do it. You can’t rely on the other services to keep covering for the largest service. And so council really has to (decide) are they more wedded to the zero or are they more wedded to protecting the police service.”</p>
      <p>Under the zero-tax-increase scenario, there would also be a $6.7-million cut to fire and emergency response budgets, resulting in the postponement of a new fire station in the north-central neighbourhood of Livingston; the cut to fire would entail the temporary cancellation of a fire engine and 20 new firefighters to service Calgary’s growing suburbs.</p>

      <p>Transit service would also take a hit, with more delays, less capacity and infrequent service on weekends as a result of an $8.3-million cut in planned spending.</p>
      <p>Calgarians could also expect urban tree maintenance to suffer, as well as longer grass in city parks and more dandelions.</p>
      <p>If council members elect to limit the tax increase to residents to 1.5 per cent in 2020, the average homeowner would save approximately $2.60 per month. Under this scenario, police budgets would be preserved, though fire and emergency services would still see a $3.4-million cut. Approximately 178 full-time jobs would also be eliminated.</p>
      <p>Maintaining the planned 3.03 per cent tax hike would cost the average home an additional $5.10 per month; police and fire budgets would be protected, the city would continue to hire and services in transit and recreation would be maintained or improved.</p>
      <p>City manager David Duckworth said Tuesday that the various budget scenarios — unlike last July’s <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/council-reverses-course-on-decision-to-bar-public-input-on-cuts">$60-million across-the-board cuts</a> — were the result of “careful consideration” by administration to limit the effect on citizens.</p>
      <p>City staff have also had to come up with additional funding for the Calgary Police Service as a result of <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/nenshi-defends-councils-record-calls-ucp-cuts-to-police-funding-surprising">provincial decisions that will result in a $13-million shortfall in police budgets in 2020. </a></p>
      <p>Officials also acknowledged Tuesday that even if council curbs spending and approves an overall tax freeze for homeowners in 2020, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/finance-committee-confronts-stark-reality-on-property-taxes">property taxes are still likely to rise if council elects to increase the share of the tax burden borne by homeowners</a> while reducing the share borne by businesses.</p>
      <p>Even with a budgetary freeze in place, taxes on the typical home could be hiked between 2.67 per cent and 6.78 per cent if council opts to tweak the existing 49/51 split between homes and businesses.</p>

      <p>“Zero doesn’t mean zero, at least not at city hall,” said Coun. Jeromy Farkas. “Council needs to make certain decisions on who is taking up the tax burden. So there are situations where even if council goes with a zero per cent budget scenario, the tax shift could mean that the typical homeowner is paying more than they did last year.”</p>
      <p>Council will discuss potential changes to the residential vs. non-residential tax split at a meeting Nov. 18.</p>
      <p>A final decision on the 2020 budget is expected later this month.</p>
      <p>Coun. Gian-Carlo Carra said the fact the city could be hiking taxes on homeowners while cutting services is a “nightmare scenario.”</p>
      <p>“I think that would be the absolute nightmare scenario,” said Carra. “If you’re raising taxes on people, you also want to be holding or maintaining service that they’re getting and not cutting into them, and in some scenarios, severely cutting into them.”</p>
      <p>Calgarians will also see a hike on their tax bills next year as a result of the province increasing the amount of property taxes it will take from the city in 2019 by $15.5 million over the previous year.</p>
      <p>The 2020 budget could result in the following adjustments to fees:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The city could cancel a planned hike in 2020 to fees for the blue and green cart program. This will save the average household approximately $3.60 per year.</li>
        <li>Monthly black cart fees could also remain frozen at 2019 rates.</li>
        <li>Wastewater collection and treatment fees could be hiked on bills by an average of $1.30 per month to compensate for slower development in new suburbs.</li>
        <li> Recreation fees are expected to decrease by 2.1 per cent in 2020.</li>
        <li>The city is recommending a new fee be charged to for-profit festivals that are held in public parks amounting to a $1/day ticket fee. This fee would not be charged to not-for-profit groups.</li>
      </ul>
