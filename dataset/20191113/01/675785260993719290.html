      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:58:23+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:58</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Jorge Masvidal has suggested Conor McGregor is running scared of him as he hasn't heard "a peep" from the Irishman since his UFC 244 win over Nate Diaz.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor</a> is set to make his long-awaited return to the octagon in 2020, and had said he wanted to fight the winner of the 'BMF' title fight between Masvidal and Diaz.</p>
      <p>That will have to wait, though, as 'The Notorious' is set to make his comeback January 18, with Donald Cerrone his expected opponent.</p>
      <p>He is expected to target a crack at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jorge-masvidal">Masvidal</a> after that, before a rematch with Khabib Nurmagomedov, who beat McGregor in the Dubliner's last bout in October 2018.</p>
      <p>However, Masvidal says he has heard nothing from McGregor since his Madison Square Garden victory over Diaz.</p>

      <p>“To be quite frank, he was flirting with fighting the winner when the possibility of the winner was Nate,” Masvidal said about McGregor in quotes reported by <a href="https://www.mmaweekly.com/jorge-masvidal-hasnt-heard-a-peep-out-of-conor-mcgregor-since-he-beat-nate-diaz">MMA Weekly</a> .</p>
      <p>“And he kept throwing it out there. He even made his prediction, he thought Nate would win. Since I’ve won, he hasn’t said a peep to address me or nothing.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kevin Lee wants to be McGregor's comeback opponent following his head kick knockout victory against the formerly unbeaten Gregor Gillespie at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>However, he realises it is unlikely.</p>

      <p>“They’re still trying to find an opponent for Conor McGregor on Jan 18,” Lee told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/12/20960151/kevin-lee-love-to-fight-conor-mcgregor-but-theyre-not-going-to-let-me-within-10-feet-of-that-man">MMA Fighting</a> . “I know they’re talking about 'Cowboy' [Donald Cerrone], but there’s no contract signed there.</p>
      <p>"If he’s a little bit like me, if he’s a competitor at his heart, then he’s going to want to take on the tough wrestler. He should if he wants to get back to Khabib [Nurmagomedov] and really wants to get back into title contention. That fight would make sense.</p>
      <p>“It’s not going to happen. I’ll be real. It’s not going to happen.</p>

      <p>"They’re not going to let me within 10 feet of that man, but these are the things that I kind of see. … I think a lot of real fans will see that and know that.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think he’s willing to do what I’ll do. I don’t think he’s willing to take on the guy who’s on the up and up.</p>
      <p>"You’ve got your back up against the wall, and he’s trying to make a name off of you. I think they’re going to avoid those types of fights. I think they’ll avoid me, they’ll avoid [Justin] Gaethje, (and) they’re going to avoid some of these other guys who can really give him a challenge.”</p>
