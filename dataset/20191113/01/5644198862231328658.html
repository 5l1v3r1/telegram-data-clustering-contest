      <p>Netherlands forward Memphis Depay is an injury doubt for their key Euro 2020 Group C qualifier against Northern Ireland in Belfast on Saturday while Georginio Wijnaldum is battling the flu, coach Ronald Koeman said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>AMSTERDAM: Netherlands forward Memphis Depay is an injury doubt for their key Euro 2020 Group C qualifier against Northern Ireland in Belfast on Saturday while Georginio Wijnaldum is battling the flu, coach Ronald Koeman said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"He (Depay) had the same thigh injury which forced him to miss our last game against Belarus, but this time on the other leg,” Koeman told a news conference.</p>

      <p>"It’s too early to say whether he will be able to play on Saturday, although Memphis himself is quite positive about it."</p>
      <p>The Dutch coach said he still had extensive options upfront as his side seek a victory to keep them on course to finish top of the group, ahead of arch rivals Germany.</p>
      <p>"If Memphis cannot play against Northern Ireland, I’ve got four other options who can fill his position."</p>
      <p>He could choose from Ryan Babel, Wout Weghorst, Luuk de Jong and the uncapped teenager Myron Boadu, who has been called-up for the first time.</p>
      <p>Koeman said he had been impressed with how easily the 18-year-old had slotted into the squad.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Wijnaldum skipped training on Tuesday because he was feeling ill, added the coach.</p>
      <p>Koeman said he was looking for a victory over Northern Ireland as well as in next Tuesday’s last group game at home to Estonia in Amsterdam,</p>
      <p>"I want six points to ensure we finish top of the group because it could help with our seedings for the finals," he said.</p>
      <p>"We haven’t played very well in our last two internationals, both in terms of possession and also our organisation."</p>
      <p>The Dutch came from behind to beat Northern Ireland 3-1 at home last month, before winning 2-1 away to Belarus.</p>
      <p>They have 15 points along with Germany but a better head-to-head record. Northern Ireland are three points adrift.</p>
