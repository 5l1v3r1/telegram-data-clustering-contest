      <p>And skilful attacking ace <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/demarai-gray">Gray</a> is urging Leicester to keep up the pressure on league leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Gray, 23, said: “We have the quality to beat any team.</p>
      <p>“It’s just about mentality really and I think you can see our spirit.</p>
      <p>“The characters we’ve got in the team when we’re all together and on it, we’re a tough team to face whether we go home or away.</p>

      <p>“I think everyone will fear us now.</p>
      <p>“We just want to stamp that down and give teams that impression that it’s never going to be easy against us."</p>
      <p>Gray added: “Everyone can see we’re playing proper football.</p>
      <p>“The way we’ve been playing over the past few weeks and the momentum that we’ve got, I’m happy that we’ve carried it through.</p>

      <p>“It’s important we got this win before the break. The boys worked hard and we deserved it.”</p>
      <p>Gray credits the work boss Rodgers has done on the training ground for turning Leicester around.</p>
      <p>He added: “We attack properly and defend properly and I think that’s where we’re evolving as a team and improving.</p>
      <p>“It’s all from the training ground. The gaffer gives us all the information, we’ve just got to put it in place on the pitch.”</p>

      <p>Gray has come off the bench in Leicester’s last four games to make an impact and insists he cannot complain about not starting.</p>
      <p>He insisted: “I’m feeling good. I’m in a good bit of form.</p>
      <p>“Whether it’s starting or off the bench, I’ve just got to try to help the team and do what I do.</p>
      <p>“My game is to make things happen and do whatever I can to help get the ball in the net, if not put it in myself.</p>
      <p>“I want to start games but I understand how it is, the team’s doing well. All I care about is the three points and climbing up the table.”</p>
