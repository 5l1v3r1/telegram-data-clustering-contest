      <h1>Second man arrested in connection with Muckamore probe released on police bail</h1>

      <p>A 33-YEAR-OLD man arrested by police in connection with abuse allegations at Muckamore Abbey Hospital was released yesterday on police bail.</p>
      <p>The suspect was arrested in the Antrim area on Monday by detectives from the PSNI's Public Public Branch.</p>
      <p>Last month a 30-year-old man became the first person to be arrested as part of the massive police investigation into alleged ill treatment of vulnerable patients in the Co Antrim facility.</p>
      <p>He was also released on police bail "pending further enquiries".</p>
      <p>The regional hospital close to Antrim town cares for adults with severe learning disabilities and is at the centre of the biggest PSNI adult safeguarding investigation in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>In August, its lead detective confirmed that 1,500 suspected crimes had been identified in one ward after police viewed thousands of hours of CCTV footage.</p>
      <p>Viewing of images in that ward, known as the Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), is now complete with the PSNI about to start examining footage from three other wards.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, a specialist team of detectives assigned to the case contacted families to inform them they had uncovered an offence of "non-contact sexual behaviour" by a staff member.</p>
      <p>PSNI officers stressed that "no patients were physically involved" in the incident.</p>
      <p>A total of 36 staff linked to alleged physical assaults and mental abuse of patients have been suspended by the Belfast health trust, which is responsible for Muckamore.</p>
      <p>In yesterday's Irish News, it was reported that almost 40 nursing staff have left their jobs at the hospital since January through resignations or retirements.</p>
