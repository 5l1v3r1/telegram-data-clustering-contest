      <p>SINGAPORE, Nov 13 — The dollar clung to most of its recent gains today after US President Donald Trump said a trade deal with China was “close” but offered no new details on negotiations to send the greenback higher.</p>
      <p>Hopes for an imminent a deal to wind back tit-for-tat tariffs the world’s two largest economies have imposed on each other have lifted the dollar 1 per cent this week to a one-month high of 98.423 overnight against a basket of currencies.</p>
      <p>It slipped a little lower to 98.309, though moves were modest as investors waited for more concrete trade news.</p>
      <p>Antipodean currencies trod water ahead of a central bank rate-setting decision in New Zealand and after data showed Australian wages growth further slowed, as expected, in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Trump’s overnight speech at the Economic Club of New York reprised well-worn criticism of the US Federal Reserve for failing to cut interest rates deeply enough and rhetoric about China’s “cheating” on trade.</p>
      <p>However he did say a deal “could happen soon”, which was enough keep the dollar from slipping.</p>
      <p>“(It) was heavy on rhetoric and light on detail, leaving markets none the wiser,” National Australia Bank’s senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.</p>
      <p>The dollar hit a month-high against the euro overnight and steadied near that level at US$1.012 (RM4.19) today.</p>
      <p>China’s yuan weakened past the 7-per-dollar mark after the speech and was steady at 7.0232 per dollar in offshore trade today.</p>
      <p>Against the Japanese yen the dollar was stable at ¥108.97 (RM4.15) — not far below the 5 1/2 month high of ¥109.48 it hit last week.</p>
      <p>The British pound was steady at US$1.2850, after a brief boost from the Brexit Party’s decision not to contest Conservative-held seats at December’s election faded.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar sat at US$0.6842, close by a two-week trough.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand dollar, which fell to near a month-low yesterday after a soft survey on inflation expectations, edged up slightly to US$0.6335 ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) interest rate-decision at 0100 GMT.</p>
      <p>Futures markets have priced in a 75 per cent chance of a rate cut.</p>
      <p>“A cut on its own probably wouldn’t do too much to the market, but if you got an ‘on-hold’, that would be a very big reaction upwards in the kiwi,” said Imre Speizer, head of New Zealand strategy at Westpac Bank in Auckland.</p>
      <p>“To get a downwards reaction, I think they’ve got to cut and then signal clearly further cuts to come.”</p>
      <p>Later on Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to testify on the U.S. economic outlook before the congressional Joint Economic Committee at 1600 GMT.</p>
      <p>The first public hearings in Trump’s impeachment inquiry begin an hour earlier at 1500 GMT. — Reuters</p>
