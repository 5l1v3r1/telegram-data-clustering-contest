        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/haas-f1">Haas</a> boss Guenther Steiner feels that Formula One cars in 2021 will go as fast as the cars which have been used this season. From 2021, cars will be at least 25 kilos heavier in comparison to this season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This comes from Pirelli's new 18-inch tires, which are heavier than the current ones, having a knock-on affect on the weight of the cars moving forward.</p>

      <p> The minimum weight of the cars will go from 743 kilos to 768 kilos which will have an impact on the speed of the cars on a fast lap.</p>
      <p> "<i>No one wants heavier cars, and more in Formula 1, because that does not make cars as smooth as they drive</i>," Steiner was quoted by F1 Only.</p>

      <p> "<i>With all the technology, security and hybrid technology you can not do otherwise. I do not think that the extra 25 kilos will be the most important factor to make cars slower, it will be more aerodynamics</i>.</p>
      <p>"<i>I think at first we may not be where we want to be, but I'm pretty sure we'll find cars as fast as they are now. I think it will also depend a lot on the tires</i>."</p>
