      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> coach <b>Molefi Ntseki </b>cleared the air on whether his relationship has gone sour with <b>Kaizer Chiefs </b>coach <b>Ernst Middendorp</b>.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Amakgosi mentor was left frustrated when defender Erick Mathoho returned to Naturena with a niggling injury after he played part in South Africa's win over Mali in the Nelson Mandela Challenge.</p>
      <p>The German coach attempted to get hold of Ntseki to find out the full details as there was confusion surrounding the Mathoho's medical reports.</p>
      <p>Ntseki revealed that there was a misunderstanding and Middendorp recently called the coach to wish Bafana Bafana the "best of luck" in Ghana.</p>
      <p>"I think people don't know my relationship with coach Ernst Middendorp - we worked together at (Bloemfontein) Celtic; we produced players together there," explained Ntseki.</p>
      <p>"We've got a very good relationship and I think there was just a misunderstanding between his medical team, in terms of the report that was sent to our medical team.</p>
      <p>"(The report) said Mathoho is ready; we rested him for two sessions when we were training here in Jo'burg, and then he joined the team and did very well.</p>
      <p>"Again, when you talk of Mathoho, he's been around for some time and he can't play with an injury â€“ not for Chiefs; not for the national team. So, he got a clean bill of health from our medical team and that is why we played him for 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>"That is why I'm saying there was just a misunderstanding. We actually spoke about it when it came to Manyama, even before the (Soweto Derby) they had challenges and I was made aware of that. After the game, we also spoke about it and I said, now Lebo is in the team.</p>
      <p>"He is very happy. I got a call from him (on Sunday) to wish the team all the best of luck. So, coach Middendorp and I, and the national team, we are on good terms."</p>
      <p>South Africa take on Ghana in an epic <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualifier when the two sides clash on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 21:00 (SA time).</p>
