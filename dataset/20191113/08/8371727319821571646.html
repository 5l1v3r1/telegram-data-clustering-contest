      <h1>Huawei to Launch Huawei Y9s and Band 4e in the Kenyan Market</h1>
      <h2>They will be launched tomorrow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:50:52+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author">Kiruti Itimu</a></address>
      <p>Huawei has invested quite heavily in the Kenyan market and we have seen them release phones at different price points. The key market in Kenya is the one below the Kshs 25,000 price tag and Huawei has a number of competitive phones below this price tag.</p>
      <p>The Chinese giant is set to launch two new devices tomorrow: The <b>Y9s </b>and their activity tracker, the <b>Band 4e.</b></p>
      <h3>Huawei Y9s</h3>

      <p>The Huawei Y9s is the latest smartphone from Huawei that was launched earlier this month in other markets.</p>
      <p>It is a modest update on the <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/06/26/huawei-y9-prime-2019-launched-in-kenya/"><b>Y9 Prime 2019 </b>that they launched in Kenya some time back</a> and they share a lot of features.</p>
      <p>The Y9s has a 6.59 inch FHD+ (2340 x 1080) display that is similar to the one on the Y9 Prime 2019. They call it the <i>Full View </i>display and it has an impressive 91% screen to body ratio.</p>
      <p>The back features curved glass with gradient colours that change with the light. You’ll also see the triple camera system and the lack of a fingerprint sensor near it. This is because Huawei decided to install the fingerprint sensor on the side.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the cameras, the Y9S has a slightly different camera system compared to the Y9 Prime 2019. The selfie camera is on a motorized platform and it is a 16MP unit with an f/2.2 lens.</p>
      <p>The primary camera system comprises of a 48MP main sensor with an f/1.8 lens, an 8MP ultra wide angle camera with a f/2.4 lens and a 2MP depth sensor. This is the same system as the P30 lite New Edition that they released recently.</p>
      <p>The Huawei Y9s still features their own custom Kirin 710F processor which is a great and relatively powerful processor for this price range. It now has 6GB of RAM  and 128GB of internal storage which you can expand further with a memory card slot.</p>
      <p>Huawei phones have great battery life and the Y9s seems like it will continue this streak. It has a 4000mAh battery which will give you ample battery life. The Y9s features a USB-C port for the curious users out there.</p>
      <h3>Huawei Band 4e</h3>

      <p>The Huawei band 4e is one of the company’s suite of wearables that replaces the Band 3e. The Band 4e has some tricks up its sleeves unlike the 3e.</p>
      <p>First, the 4e has a ‘Dual wearing’ mode. You can either wear the tracker on your wrist or better still, you can attach it on your shoe. Wearing it on your wrist will help you track activity such as sleep or activity tracking. On your shoe, it can help you collect “precise basketball or running performance statistics” according to Huawei. That is pretty cool.</p>
      <p>Huawei promises that the 4e will provide you with upto 2 weeks of battery life with regular use and 21 days under standby mode. It is water resistant upto 50 metres which means you can use it during sweaty workouts or when you’re swimming.</p>
      <p>The Band 4e tracks a variety of activities as well as inform you about various things that you engage in your life. This include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Steps</li>
        <li>Distance</li>
        <li>Calories</li>
        <li>Achievement reminders</li>
        <li>Moderate to high intensity workouts</li>
        <li>Single workout distance</li>
        <li>Single workout time</li>
        <li>Activity reminders</li>
        <li>Stand reminders</li>
        <li>Sleep time</li>
        <li>Alarms</li>
        <li>Messenger reminder</li>
        <li>Incoming call notifications</li>
        <li>Find phone</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This band will pair well with the Huawei Health app that is sometimes pre-installed on Huawei phones.</p>
