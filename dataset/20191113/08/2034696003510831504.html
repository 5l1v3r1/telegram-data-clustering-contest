      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-libertines">The Libertines</a> frontman <a href="http://nme.com/artists/pete-doherty">Pete Doherty</a> has been fined £8,500 and handed a three-month suspended jail sentence for “violence while intoxicated” after being arrested in Paris twice in a week.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old singer was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/pete-doherty-arrested-for-buying-cocaine-in-paris-2565968">detained in the French capital’s Pigalle district after buying cocaine in the early hours of Friday morning</a> and was provisionally fined £4,280. After being released from custody, he went out to celebrate and took a combination of alcohol, valium and sleeping pills, his lawyer Arash Derambarsh said.</p>
      <p>Doherty is then thought to have got into an argument with two people in the street, which led to his <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/pete-doherty-arrested-in-paris-for-second-time-after-drunken-brawl-with-teenager-2566646">eventual re-arrest on Sunday morning</a>.</p>
      <p>Derambarsh added that Doherty was then handed the hefty fine alongside a two-year probation period.</p>

      <p>“It is a lenient decision. Mr. Doherty will be able to keep singing. It is what we had asked,” Derambarsh told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The Pigalle district of Paris is known for its trade in drugs, with sources claiming last week that Doherty was in possession of two grams of cocaine at the time of his arrest.</p>
      <p>The singer, whose well-documented battle with drugs have previously landed him in legal trouble, was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/pete-doherty-has-been-given-a-six-month-driving-ban-2554779">also handed a six-month driving ban after being caught speeding earlier this year.</a></p>
      <p>The arrests comes amid The Libertines’ European tour. Their next show is at Luxembourg’s Den Atelier on November 17, before continuing with a string of shows across the continent and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/boys-band-return-libertines-announce-december-2019-uk-tour-2513555">arriving in the UK in December</a>.</p>
      <p>Doherty released <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/peter-doherty-the-puta-madres-album-review">a new solo album with his project Peter Doherty &amp; The Puta Madres</a> earlier this year.</p>
