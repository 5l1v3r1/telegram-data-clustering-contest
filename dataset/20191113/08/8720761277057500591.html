      <p>Oculus CTO John Carmack <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2547632585471243&amp;id=100006735798590">announced</a> Wednesday that he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963899/john-carmack-stepping-down-cto-of-oculus-work-on-ai">is stepping down from the augmented-reality company</a> to focus his time on artificial general intelligence. The Verge reports: <i>Carmack will remain in a "consulting CTO" position at Oculus, where he will "still have a voice" in the development work at the company, he wrote. Recent comments from Carmack suggest he may have soured on VR. Carmack was a champion of phone-based VR for years at Oculus, but in October, he delivered a "eulogy" for Oculus' phone-based Gear VR. And in a video for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/john-carmack-says-hes-not-satisfied-with-the-pace-of-progress-in-vr-development/">receiving a lifetime achievement award</a> this week at the VR Awards, he said that "I really haven't been satisfied with the pace of progress that we've been making" in VR.</i></p>
