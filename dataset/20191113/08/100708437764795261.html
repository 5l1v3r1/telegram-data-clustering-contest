      <p>Our December 2019 special issue features a redesigned look and comes out on newsstands exactly 162 years to the month after our very first issue. With it, we’re introducing a new logo, our first unique typeface, and original photography and illustrations that you’ll see not only in our print magazine, but also on our website, app, and more.</p>
      <p>The focus of this special issue is “How to Stop a Civil War,” with contributions from Adam Serwer, Jonathan Haidt, Yoni Appelbaum, Lin-Manuel Miranda, General James Mattis, Caitlin Flanagan, and others. You’ll also find essays, reports, and interviews by Megan Garber, Graeme Wood, David Frum, and Sophie Gilbert. The issue also contains the inaugural edition of Amanda Mull’s new column, called “Material World.”</p>
      <p>To celebrate <i>The Atlantic</i>’s bold new design, we’re holding another round of our #ReadingMyAtlantic contest, in which you’re invited to take a photo with your new December issue, or in front of our Brooklyn mural, and share it with us.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here’s how to enter:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Take a picture or Boomerang with a caption of you reading your copy of the December 2019 <i>Atlantic</i>, or in front of our mural on the corner of Kent Avenue and North 11th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and share it on Instagram using the hashtag #ReadingMyAtlantic. The mural will be up until December 15, 2019. Your account will need to be public so we can see your posts. We’ll select the winners in early December. First place will receive a one-year digital subscription and an <i>Atlantic</i> tote bag. Second and third place will each get an <i>Atlantic</i> tote bag. All three winning posts will be shared from our Instagram account, so be sure to give us a follow. Make sure to post your #ReadingMyAtlantic entry before December 6, 2019, to be considered.

Sponsor further reserves the right to disqualify any entry that is alleged to infringe on any third party’s intellectual-property rights, or that Sponsor, in its sole discretion, deems obscene, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate for viewing by a general audience. Sponsor will not be responsible for incomplete, lost, late, misdirected, or illegible entries. By entering, you agree to receive emails from Sponsor or those directed by Sponsor.

Winners may be required to complete an affidavit of eligibility/liability and publicity release (except where prohibited by law), which must be returned as directed by Sponsor. Failure to sign and return the affidavit or release or to comply with any term or condition of these Official Rules may result in a Winner’s disqualification, the forfeiture of his or her interest in the prize, and the award of the prize to a substitute Winner. Except where prohibited, acceptance of any prize constitutes Winner’s consent to the publication of his or her name, biographical information, and likeness in any media for any commercial or promotional purpose, including, without limitation the internet, or further compensation.

Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify persons found tampering with or otherwise abusing any aspect of this Contest as solely determined by Sponsor. In the event the Contest is compromised by a virus, nonauthorized human intervention, tampering, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Sponsor that corrupt or impair the administration, security, fairness, or proper operation of the Contest, Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to suspend, modify, or terminate the Contest. Should the Contest be terminated prior to the stated expiration date, Sponsor reserves the right to award prizes based on the entries received before and/or after the termination date, or in such manner as deemed fair and appropriate by Sponsor.</p>
