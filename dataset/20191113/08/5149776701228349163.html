      <h1>The brilliant advert that Nottingham Forest fans - and Tom Hanks - will love</h1>
      <h2>A blockbuster of a football club and a blockbuster of a film!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:39:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:39</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>One put together a run so phenomenal it took them all the way to the pinnacle of European football; the other simply ran.</p>
      <p>A blockbuster of a football club and a blockbuster of a film.</p>
      <p>The link between <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> and the 1994 Tom Hanks classic Forrest Gump is perhaps not an obvious one to make.</p>
      <p>But Reds fans will surely love how the two have been given top billing on a new advert.</p>
      <p>A poster from the bank HSBC, which is on display in the city and is part of their localised campaign, has united the two.</p>
      <p>It reads: “Nottingham gave us Forest. Alabama told him to run.”</p>
      <p>Underneath is the bank’s tagline: “We are not an island. We are part of something far, far bigger.”</p>

      <p>The movie Forrest Gump was about a man, famously played by Hanks, from Alabama who witnesses a number of historically significant events.</p>
      <p>One of the best-known lines is: “Run, Forrest! Run!”</p>
      <p>But HSBC are clearly keen to ensure there is no city bias towards the Reds...</p>
      <p>A picture of the ad was posted on Twitter by @tomtomwilkins, and in response, the bank joked Gump could run “all the way across Trent Bridge and to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Meadow Lane</a> to add a little balance.”</p>
