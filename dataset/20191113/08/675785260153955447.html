      <p>A two-year-old girl died after she was hit by an air-conditioning unit that fell from an eighth floor apartment.</p>
      <p>The toddler, who was being pushed in her pram at the time by her mum, was rushed to hospital but medics were unable to save her.</p>
      <p>Witnesses in Toronto, Canada, described distressing scenes after the unit tumbled some distance from the building run by Toronto Community Housing (TCH).</p>
      <p>The girl's siblings, aged five and seven, were present having just been picked up from school.</p>
      <p>"I could see her [mum] trying to revive her daughter, and I didn’t even grab my jacket, I grabbed my keys and ran downstairs," Sherene Bromfield, who lives nearby, said.</p>

      <p>TCH will do a "thorough investigation" into what caused the air conditioner unit to come loose and fall to the ground.</p>
      <p>"Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time and we offer them our sincere condolences," a statement said.</p>
      <p>Its website warns tenants about the dangers posed by window AC units.</p>
      <p>It says: “Improperly installed window air conditioners are a serious safety hazard to you and your family, and can fall onto other people."</p>
      <p>It also says tenants must have permission to install the units and should by placed over balconies whenever possible.</p>
      <p>The website adds: "You may be held liable for injuries or property damage from improperly installed window air conditioners.”</p>
