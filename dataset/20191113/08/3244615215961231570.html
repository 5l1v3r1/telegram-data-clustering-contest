      <p>Apple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/apple-is-finally-willing-to-make-gadgets-thicker-so-they-work-better.html">has started to make its products thicker</a> in an effort to give people what they want: functionality over form. This is a good thing. There are two recent examples: this year's iPhones and the <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/19/11/13/145242/apple-unveils-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-with-improved-keyboard-starting-at-2400">new 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>. Todd Haselton writes via CNBC: <i>This is a theory, but it seems this may be that there are some design changes being made after the <a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/19/06/27/2124214/jony-ive-iphone-designer-leaving-apple-to-form-independent-company">departure of Apple's former chief design officer Jony Ive</a>. Ive was known for creating gorgeous products but, sometimes as we've seen with the older MacBook keyboard, perhaps at the cost of functionality. Form over function, as they say. [...] If you look back at the iPhone 8, for example, the phone measured just 7.3-mm thick, an example of Apple's seeming obsession with creating devices that were as thin as possible but often at the cost of battery life. But this year, Apple put a huge focus on battery life because it knows that's one of top things people want from their phones (along with great cameras). As a result of the larger battery, this year's iPhone 11 is slightly fatter at 8.3-mm thick. It's barely noticeable but shows that Apple knows people are willing to sacrifice on thinness for a phone that lasts all day. <br/><br/>Then there's the 16-inch MacBook Pro that was announced on Wednesday. It's less than 1-mm thicker than the 15-inch MacBook Pro that it replaces, and it weighs 4.3 pounds instead of 4 pounds in the prior model. It's 2% larger than the 15-inch MacBook Pro, too. All of this helps Apple include what people want in a similar but slightly bigger form factor: a keyboard with keys that you can actually tap into and that works, instead of one that's practically flat with very little key travel. The flat so-called butterfly keyboard was prone to exposure to dust and debris, which could lead to keys not registering or repeating themselves and, ultimately, lots of typos. Apple also focused on battery life in its new laptop. It lasts an hour longer than last year's model and charges fully in just 2.5 hours. That's partly because Apple was able to increase the battery size, something that likely contributed to the larger and heavier form factor.</i></p>
