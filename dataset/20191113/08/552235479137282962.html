      <p>She is one of the bulkiest things ever seen in Ayr Bay.</p>
      <p>But thankfully MPI Adventure is just awaiting the next job.</p>
      <p>The 454 foot long ship weighs nearly 15,000 tons and puts up wind turbines.</p>
      <p>Heaven forbid they could ever spoil the view of Arran from the Ayrshire coast..</p>
      <p>Our photographer Euan McCall took this shot from Ayr pier, where she is lying 2.5 miles out.</p>
      <p>The six big legs are 240 feet long and can fix turbines to the sea bed at depths of up to 130 feet.</p>
      <p>And the big crane can lift 1000 tons at a time.</p>
      <p>The Chinese built vessel is so big it can accommodate a crew of 200 and has Rolls Royce engines totalling 21,750 horse power.</p>
      <p>An Ayr Port spokesman confirmed the MPI Adventure was “just resting.”</p>
