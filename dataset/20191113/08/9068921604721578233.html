      <p>Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-introduces-16-inch-macbook-pro-the-worlds-best-pro-notebook/">announced</a> its much-rumored <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, which is the largest MacBook Pro that's been offered for sale since the discontinuation of the 17-inch MacBook Pro back in 2012.</p>

      <p>The updated 16-inch MacBook Pro features a larger display with slimmer bezels than the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which it has <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">replaced in Apple's notebook lineup</a>. The display has a resolution of 3072x1920 pixels with up to 500 nits of brightness. <br/><br/>The notebook features an updated "Magic Keyboard" that does away with the unpopular butterfly mechanism, returning instead to a more reliable scissor mechanism with 1mm key travel, along with Intel's latest 9th-generation processors with up to 8 cores. It also has up to 64GB of RAM and up to 8TB of SSD storage. <br/><br/>Above the keyboard, the Touch Bar lives on, but the 16-inch MacBook Pro marks the return of a physical Esc key. In line with the latest MacBook Air, the Touch ID sensor has also been separated from the Touch Bar.</p>

      <p>Other features include AMD Radeon Pro 5000M graphics options paired with GDDR6 video memory and an 8GB VRAM option, a larger 100Wh battery for longer battery life, a redesigned six-speaker sound system, and upgraded microphones. <br/><br/>Starting at $2,399 in the United States, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">available today through Apple.com</a> and the Apple Store app. It will be in Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Resellers in the United States later this week and is "coming soon" to stores around the world, according to Apple.</p>
