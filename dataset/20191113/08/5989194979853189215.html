        <b>Here's a word to describe a Swedish food that may, on first glance, sound quite bizarre: smörgåstårta.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20190102/swedish-word-of-the-day-smorgas">Smörgås</a></i> means 'sandwich' (although perhaps not quite the way you think of a sandwich, as <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20190102/swedish-word-of-the-day-smorgas">we've discussed in a previous Word of the Day</a>), while <i>tårta</i> means cake (generally a soft, large cake for sharing, <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181101/swedish-word-of-the-day-kex">as explained here</a>).</p>
      <p>A <i>smörgåstårta,</i> then, is a 'sandwich cake'.</p>

      <p>And yes, it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like.</p>
      <p>Sandwich ingredients, layered and decorated just like a dessert cake, except it's cold, savoury and often fishy.</p>
      <p>To build a <i>smörgåstårta</i>, you layer up white or rye bread with savoury creamy fillings such as pâté, cream cheese or mayonnaise. Additional typical <i>smörgås</i> toppings such as cold meats, cheese, fish, and vegetables can be added into the mix too.</p>
      <p>The finished product is decorated with more creamy toppings and garnishes that may include shrimps, tomatoes, cucumber or herbs, for example.</p>

      <p>The <i>smörgåstårta </i>is served at special occasions such as parties or an office fika, when it's cut into slices like a cake. The big advantage is that it can be prepared or ordered in advance, making it a simpler choice for hosts than hot food.</p>
      <p>But it doesn't usually make an appearance at national celebrations such as Midsummer or Christmas, when buffet-style food is the normal choice.</p>
      <p>The first recorded reference to <i>smörgåstårta</i> was in a Småland newspaper in 1934, and it appears to have grown in popularity after the Second World War, possibly due to the free availability of ingredients such as butter and cheese after rationing ended.</p>
      <p>In 2012, November 13th was chosen as the official Smörgastårta Day, following in <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20141105/seven-delicious-dates-in-sweden">the Swedish tradition of giving beloved national foods their own day</a> of celebration. The day was popularized by the group Smörgåstårtans Vänner (literally Friends of the Sandwich Cake), which counts over 1,000 members nationwide.</p>
      <p>So, happy sandwich cake day one and all!</p>
