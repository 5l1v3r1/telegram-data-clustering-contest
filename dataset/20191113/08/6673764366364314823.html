      <p>Toshiba Corp. reported a net loss Wednesday of ¥145.15 billion ($1.3 billion) for the April-September period, due in part to taking a loss on the sale of a U.S. liquefied natural gas operation.</p>
      <p>The company’s net loss compares with a profit of ¥1.08 trillion reported for the same time period a year earlier, when it booked a profit from the sale of a chip unit.</p>
      <p>For the first six months of the current fiscal year, the technology conglomerate said its operating profit came to ¥52.05 billion, up from ¥6.98 billion the year before, on sales of ¥1.71 trillion, down 3.7 percent.</p>
      <p>The company is continuing its reform efforts following the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power subsidiary in 2017.</p>
      <p>For the year through next March, Toshiba maintained its profit guidance, with expectations for annual operating profit to nearly quadruple to ¥140 billion. As for sales, it raised its previous estimate of ¥3.40 trillion to ¥3.44 trillion.</p>
      <p>The company did not provide a net profit forecast, citing difficulty in assessing the earnings of an affiliated chip company, Kioxia Holdings Corp., formerly known as Toshiba Memory Holdings Corp., in which Toshiba has a 40.2 percent voting right.</p>
      <p>Toshiba sold Toshiba Memory to an international consortium of U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. in June last year and reinvested about ¥350 billion in the chip firm.</p>
