      <h1>Free travel passes to enable young people to discover Europe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:40:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">Newsroom</a></address>
      <p>Thanks to backing by MEPs, 50,000 18-year-olds have enjoyed the chance to travel in the EU for free since its launch in June 2018. An additional 20,000 will now also be able to benefit from the Discover EU initiative, which was first proposed during Parliament’s European Youth Event (EYE) in 2014.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How it will work</b>
      </p>
      <p>At least 20,000 young people will get the chance to travel Europe by rail between 1 April and 31 October 2020. Any EU citizen born between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2001 can <a href="https://europa.eu/youth/discovereu/apply_en">apply for tickets online</a> from noon (CET) on 7 November until noon (CET) on 28 November. To be eligible, applicants will have to answer a few multiple choice questions.</p>
      <p>Participants will be able to travel for up to 30 days to at least one foreign country. Travel will be mainly by rail, but also by bus and ferry to ensure wide access. Flights will be allowed in exceptional cases where no other form of transport is available. This could be for example for people coming from remote areas or outermost regions.</p>
      <p>Participants with reduced mobility or special needs may be eligible for extra help, for example support with the costs for an accompanying person or dog for those with a visual impairment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Parliament support</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Parliament has been a strong advocate of the idea of <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fTEXT%2bCRE%2b20161004%2bITEM-015%2bDOC%2bXML%2bV0%2f%2fEN&amp;language=EN">free rail tickets for 18-year-old Europeans</a>, adopting three resolutions backing the initiative.</p>
      <p>MEPs believe the initiative will allow young people to experience Europe’s diversity, better understand each other and learn more about Europe. They expect encouraging young EU citizens to travel in the EU and meet people from other countries will foster European identity and reinforce common EU values.</p>
