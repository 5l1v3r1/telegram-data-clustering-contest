      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) - Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday strongly condemned the 100-day long illegal curfew on occupied Kashmir, which was imposed by India.</p>
      <p>The statement issued by Shehbaz Sharif stated that the brave Kashmiris repeated a history of seven decades of great perseverance and sacrifices in hundred days. “We salute Kashmiris and their sacrifices during this torturous lockdown”, he added.</p>
      <p>He expressed that every cruelty of India intensifies the urge for independence in the heart of Kashmiris. “For more than 72 years, the brave Kashmiri people have been facing Indian atrocities”, he said, adding that these hundred days prove that the global conscience is sleeping.</p>
      <p>The Opposition Leader in National Assembly asserted that the oppressed Kashmiris are asking for the Security Council and other organizations during the open human rights violation of the UN charter. “The history will not remember the role of the Security Council and human rights organizations in positive aspects”, he added.</p>
      <p>The PML-N leader said that the brutal, authoritarian and barbaric actions of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have faced defeat on the hands of Kashmiris’ great patience and sacrifices.  </p>
