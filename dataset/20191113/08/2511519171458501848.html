      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo: Rodrygo on comparison to Real Madrid legend and key to fast start at Bernabeu</h1>
      <h2>The 18-year-old struck a hat-trick in the Champions League against Galatasaray this month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:27:36+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Rathborn</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rodrygo">Rodrygo</a> has distanced himself from being compared to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/CristianoRonaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> after his electric start to life at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RealMadrid">Real Madrid</a>.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian youngster struck a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Champions-League">Champions League</a> hat-trick against Galatasaray and already has five goals in six appearances for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>But the 18-year-old admits to being disappointed at never playing with Ronaldo at the Bernabeu, following his move to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Juventus">Juventus</a>.</p>
      <p>“Being able to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid was a dream of mine and it’s a shame that he left because now I think it would be very difficult to play with him,” Rodrygo said.</p>
      <p>“I am still a very young player to talk about filling the place left by someone like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is one of the greatest players in the history of the club – if not the greatest.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to weigh myself down with the pressure of replacing Cristiano Ronaldo.”</p>
      <p>Rodrygo also revealed the key to his bright start at the Bernabeu and the influence of his father Eric, a former footballer who featured in the lower leagues in Brazil.</p>
      <p>“You always try to make sure you are fully prepared so that things turn out well, but I could never have imagined that everything would happen so quickly,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s all come as a huge surprise to me. Only a short while ago I was hoping to make my Champions League debut... and maybe at the most score a goal.</p>

      <p>“Scoring a hat-trick like I did was something nobody expected. So I can’t really explain how I felt after the game. All I could do was enjoy a special, once-in-a-lifetime moment.</p>
      <p>“Learning the ropes as a footballer isn’t just about what’s done on the training pitch. There is a big mental part too, preparing yourself so that success doesn’t go to your head and knowing how to handle fame and to not be presumptuous. </p>
      <p>“On that side of things, it helped me a lot that my father was a footballer, and that gave me a head start on the mental part. I watched him go through things that are happening to me now and so I know I can’t let all of this attention go to my head.”</p>
