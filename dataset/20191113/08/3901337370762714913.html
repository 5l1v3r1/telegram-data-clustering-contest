      <p>Bafana Bafana head coach, Molefi Ntseki explained why he was scared for two of his players whilst watching them in action in the Absa Premiership.</p>
      <p>Ntseki explained that he was present at the Bidvest Stadium on Friday night to watch Bidvest Wits in action against SuperSport United, where he took note of the physical aggression between Bradley Grobler and Thulani Hlatshwayo, with concern about a risk of injury. </p>
      <p>However, being the sportsmen that they are, they both managed to put the incident behind them and focus on the national team.</p>

      <p>“I was at Wits vs SuperSport on the weekend and I was scared to be honest with you, the tussle, the fight, the duels, the physical aggression that we say between Tyson and Bradley, I hoped that they didn’t hurt each other because we really need them for the two matches, but being sportsmen and professionals, they conducted themselves very well and they ended the game without exchanging blows and we have both of them here in camp,” Ntseki said. </p>
      <p>Bafana will lock horns with Ghana on Thursday in their opening Africa Cup Of Nations qualifier. </p>
