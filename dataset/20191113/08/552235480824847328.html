      <h2>The SJFA's west region secretary has said that an investigation has been launched.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Dunn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>An investigation has been launched following an alleged racist incident at a football game.</p>
      <p>Glasgow Junior side St Anthony’s claim that their Polish striker was told to “get back to his own f*****g country” by a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Hurlford United</a> player on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Scottish Junior Football Association’s West Region secretary has told the Kilmarnock Standard that a probe into the incident has now been launched.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>An official at the West Region League Two club said that the instance has left them disgusted.</p>
      <p>The alleged incident took place near the end of the West of Scotland Cup game which saw Hurlford run out 4-3 winners on the day.</p>
      <p>St Anthony’s Football Club posted on Twitter after the match: “Disappointed to report that Ants Polish striker Kamil Leszczynski was told to ‘get back to his own f*****g country’ by an opposition player in the 94th minute of today’s game v Hurlford United.</p>
      <p>“The club feels it has to highlight this as we believe racism has no place in football of any level and are disgusted that in this day and age language like this is used by anyone let alone a fellow player.”</p>
      <p>West Region secretary for Scottish Junior Football Association Scott Robertson said that there was no room for racism, bigotry or sectarianism in the game.</p>

      <p>Mr Robertson added:“We will be writing to Hurlford for their observations on the incident.</p>
      <p>“We have started an investigation and have put the wheels in motion to get to the bottom of what happened.</p>
      <p>“What I can say is that this will not be swept under the carpet .</p>
      <p>“There is no room for racism, sectarianism or bigotry in Junior football.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Junior football is a game for families and is not for these idiots.</p>
      <p>“This is 2019 and you can’t be saying things like that.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Hurlford United told the Kilmarnock Standard: “Hurlford United are aware of an allegation, on Twitter, against one of our players. An investigation is ongoing.”</p>
