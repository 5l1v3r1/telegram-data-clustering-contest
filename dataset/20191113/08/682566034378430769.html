      <p>Cape Town - <b>Amagluglug</b> head coach <b>David Notoane</b> says he is pleased with the manner of his side's <b>1-0</b> victory against the <b>Ivory Coast</b> at the <b>U23 Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b>.</p>
      <p>Notoane's side dictated matters from the start when threatening their opponent's goal from as early as the second minute.</p>
      <p>The only thing missing from an impressive performance was goals with the deadlock broken eventually in the 78th minute. But what a goal it was to decide the encounter.</p>
      <p>SuperSport United midfielder Teboho Mokoena stepped up to hit an unstoppable free-kick from around 35 yards out to give his side their first win in Group B.</p>
      <p>"We are very happy to get our first win of the tournament, especially against a strong side such as Ivory Coast," Notoane said.</p>
      <p>"This was both a tactical and physical battle which needed a special moment to determine the end result, and I am glad that we are the ones who managed to come up with it.</p>
      <p>"Mokoena was a pleasant surprise for us when he stepped up to take the free-kick," Notoane added. "We have a number of players such as Luther Singh, Sipho Mbule and Kobamelo Kodisang who could normally take free-kicks for us on any given day, however, Mokoena felt pretty confident about this one.</p>
      <p>"If you ask me, I would not have been happy to have drawn in my second group match - following the 0-0 draw against Zambia - and I am truly happy that we were able to push for this winning result in this tie."</p>
      <p>As it stands, South Africa are top of Group B with four points after two matches played.</p>
      <p>They will face second-placed Nigeria who are a point behind in their final group clash on November 15 at the Al Salam Stadium.</p>
      <p>Notoane said his side will prepare accordingly to fight for another winning result in their last group game.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 20:00.</p>
