      <h2>The traumatised girl was raped by Anthony Roscoe, who is 15 years her senior, after his girlfriend Chloe Bradley, then 17, arranged a threesome at his home in St Helens, Merseyside</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:10:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Traynor, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-traynor/</a></address>
      <p>A girl who was just 12 when she was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rape">raped</a> by a 27-year-old man in a threesome arranged by his 17-year-old girlfriend has told how she has been left extremely traumatised.</p>
      <p>The girl told a court she now feels "numb" about what happened to her, struggles to sleep and suffers flashbacks.</p>
      <p>Now 14, she said she doesn't let anyone touch her, has no interest in going to school and is getting through life "one day at a time" after being raped by Anthony Roscoe, who is 15 years her senior, at his home in St Helens, Merseyside.</p>
      <p>Roscoe, now 29, has been jailed and his girlfriend Chloe Bradley, now 19, has avoided a prison sentence for the incident on August 20, 2017, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/girl-12-raped-27-year-17246155">Liverpool Echo</a> reports.</p>

      <p>The girl told Bolton Crown Court in a victim impact statement on Tuesday: "I feel numb about what happened and I don't know how to feel about what's happened to me.</p>
      <p>"It's changed me mentally, I don't sleep and I have flashbacks.</p>
      <p>"It's made me more aware of men and I don't let anyone touch me.</p>
      <p>"I feel there is no point going to school.</p>

      <p>"I kind of hate Chloe Bradley and I feel different towards her.</p>
      <p>"I'm just getting through one day at a time.</p>
      <p>"I was relieved when they pleaded guilty as I don't know what I would have done."</p>
      <p>Roscoe stunned detectives when he told them after his arrest: "When somebody hands you the Holy Grail, you’re going to grab it, aren't you?"</p>
      <p>He admitted rape and was jailed for four years.</p>

      <p>Bradley, who was said to have an emotional age of 10, pleaded guilty to arranging the commission of a child sex offence.</p>
      <p>She was given a 22-month sentence suspended for a year and was ordered to wear an electronic tag for three months and sign the Sex Offender Register for 10 years.</p>
      <p>The rape happened after Bradley, who lives with her parents in Wigan, messaged her on-off boyfriend Roscoe about a rendezvous and then escorted the young girl to his home on the bus.</p>
      <p>He took turns having sex with Bradley and raping the 12-year-old victim.</p>
      <p>Police became involved by chance when a passing patrol spotted the girls leaving Roscoe's home at 5.30am the following morning.</p>

      <p>Bradley's phone was examined and found to contain conversations between herself and Roscoe.</p>
      <p>Initially both girls told police Roscoe had forced himself on them but police charged Bradley after uncovering the messages on her phone and that of Roscoe.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: "There was a significant amount of highly sexualised chat and discussion over a period of several days, which occurred mainly over WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</p>
      <p>"...Bradley also sent a series of messages to Roscoe asking him if he would like a threesome with her and the complainant.</p>

      <p>"She said both of them were 'up for it'. He was enthusiastic at that prospect.</p>
      <p>"It seems that many of those messages between Bradley and Roscoe had been deliberately deleted from Bradley’s phone, including messages dealing with sexual talk.</p>
      <p>"Also found on his phone was a message from Roscoe to Bradley saying he didn’t want her coming round with any kids.</p>
      <p>"It would appear that Bradley deleted the messages to minimise the appearance of her offending and to minimise her culpability.</p>
      <p>“Roscoe was arrested at his flat that morning at 10am. He was cautioned and he made many comments denying the allegations, saying they made him 'feel sick'.</p>
      <p>"In interview he accepted he had sexual intercourse with both Bradley and the complainant - stating Bradley had suggested having a threesome.</p>
      <p>"He said he had not met the complainant before, but he knew Bradley for about two months and had had sex with her before.</p>
      <p>“He said Bradley told him she was 17.</p>
      <p>Roscoe had not groomed his victim, his lawyer said.</p>
      <p>He denied having a sexual attraction to children.</p>
      <p>He lives with his mum who has significant mental health problems, the court was told.</p>
