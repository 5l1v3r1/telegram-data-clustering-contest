      <h1>Celtic diehard Darren Fletcher proves his Hoops credentials as he sports memorable 90s away kit</h1>
      <h2>The Manchester United legend enjoyed a career the envy of many but his love for his boyhood team has always remained steadfast.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:17:38+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:17</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>He never got the chance to wear Celtic's famous green and white hoops for real but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/darren-fletcher">Darren Fletcher</a> 's love for the Premiership champions has been a lifelong affair.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend, who retired in the summer, enjoyed a career the envy of many but his love for his boyhood team has always remained steadfast.</p>
      <p>Fletcher has been a Parkhead regular over the years to watch his team and was even an unused substitute on the night Shunsuke Nakamura downed Sir Alex Ferguson's achievers in 2006.</p>
      <p>And the former Scotland captain is set to discuss his Hoops affinity at length in his upcoming appearance on BT Sports' <i>What I Wore</i> series that allows football greats to reveal the strips that mean the most to them.</p>

      <p>Fletcher looked delighted as he posed in the club's 91/92 away kit - a strip that certainly got people talking with its unique design.</p>
      <p>The Old Trafford hero has spoken in the past of his Hoops love and praised former boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> back in 2017 for securing a historic invincible Treble with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: "You've got my f****** clubÂ brilliant again!"</p>
