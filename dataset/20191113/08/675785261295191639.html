      <h1>Premier League referees 'stunned' by boss Mike Riley saying he's pleased with VAR performance</h1>
      <h2>The comments left top-flight referees stunned, with the officials annoyed that they are being made to look amateur by the new technology this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T08:45:44+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>The referees' chief Mike Riley has stunned Premier League match officials after controversially claiming: "I’m well pleased with the way VAR is operating."</p>
      <p>VAR caused yet more controversy over the weekend, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> manager Pep Guardiola fuming after Liverpool's 3-1 defeat of his side at Anfield on Sunday, in which his side had two penalty appeals rejected.</p>
      <p>Another controversial VAR incident occurred on Saturday at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , in which Sheffield United were denied a goal for the tightest of offside decisions.</p>
      <p>And, following several controversial decisions and criticism from fans and pundits, Riley raised a few eyebrows with his bizarre take on the technology in the top-flight.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10334009/premier-league-var-mike-riley-referee">The Sun</a> , he told Select Group One officials at a two-day meeting in Leicestershire he has been “well pleased with the way VAR is operating at the moment”.</p>
      <p>The comments left top-flight referees stunned, with the officials annoyed that they are being made to look amateur by the new technology this season.</p>
      <p>Riley isn't the only one to praise VAR this week, with Neil Swarbrick - the Premier League’s head of VAR - saying he has been impressed with the impact of the technology.</p>

      <p>He said: "I’m really pleased, honestly, with how we have started out. We have more decisions correct with VAR than without it.</p>
      <p>"I’d give us around about seven-ish. If the mark now is seven — early days — in two years’ time I’m hoping for maybe a eight and a half or nine. We are open to evolving with this.</p>
      <p>"It’s not a case of we’re not budging. We will listen to feedback. I’m comfortable with where we are but there’s no doubt there’s room for improvement. It’s a work in progress."</p>
