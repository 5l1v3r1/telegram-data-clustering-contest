      <p>On Monday, England boss <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/euro-2016/raheem-sterling-sensationally-axed-from-england-squad-after-bust-up/667284">Gareth Southgate announced that Sterling would play no part in his team's 2020 European Championship qualifier against Montenegro</a> on Thursday, following his in-camp spat with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez had clashed in City's 3-1 loss to the Reds at Anfield this past Sunday, and their spat seemingly continued when they crossed paths while reporting for international duty.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old forward accepted his punishment, and <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/world-news/raheem-sterling-reacts-to-being-dropped-from-england-squad-after-bust-up/667295">released a statement in which he explained that he and Gomez had moved on</a> from what had happened, before pictures emerged of the Liverpool defender training with a scratch below his right eye.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Southgate has stood by his decision to leave Sterling out of the Montenegro match, and it has since come out that the manager first considered sending the player home from the camp, but Gomez reportedly pleaded with the manager to keep the City attacker in the squad.</p>
      <p>According to a report in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, Sterling could still be charged with misconduct by the FA, despite the two players being spotted getting along in training after the incident.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that Sterling's jewellery may have caused the scratch under Gomez's eye before they were pulled apart by their England colleagues in a canteen where the altercation took place.</p>

      <p>On the field, Sterling has been in terrific form for the Three Lions of late, contributing to 10 goals in his past four matches for his country.</p>
