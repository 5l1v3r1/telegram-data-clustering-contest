      <h1>Rain saves Tshwane Spartans from precarious situation</h1>

      <p><b>Match abandoned</b> <i><b>Tshwane Spartans</b> 33 for 4 (de Villiers 10*, van Biljon 3*, Morris 2-8) v <b>Nelson Mandela Bay Giants</b></i></p>
      <p>Tshwane Spartans were in a precarious position against Nelson Mandela Bay Giants before a floodlight failure, lightning and then rain forced the game to be called off.</p>
      <p>The Spartans were 33 for 4 in 7.1 overs when the floodlights malfunctioned at 6.10pm local time. While the players were waiting for power to be restored, a lightning threat forced them indoors. The floodlights were back on in about 40 minutes but then rain made an appearance and the match was eventually called off at 7.35pm.</p>
      <p>The Spartans' first game, against Durban Heat, was abandoned without a ball being bowled. The Giants are at the top of the table for now with six points from two games.</p>
      <p>The Spartans didn't have a great start after being put in as Chris Morris dismissed Theunis de Bruyn and Dean Elgar in the third over. de Bruyn top-edged a flick in front of square leg, while Elgar failed to put bat to a full toss and was trapped lbw for a first-ball duck.</p>
      <p>Vaughn van Jaarsveld fell in the next over when Junior Dala hit the stumps direct at the non-striker's end with the batsman a bit slow to get back in. Dala dented the Spartans further with captain Heinrich Klaasen's wicket to leave them reeling at 28 for 4 in the sixth over.</p>
      <p>AB de Villiers tried to rescue them and was batting on 10 along with Pite van Biljon before the external factors had their say.</p>
