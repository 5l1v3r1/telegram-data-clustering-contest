      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd Research (MIDF Research) has forecast Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) to expand at a moderating pace of 4.7 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) for the third quarter of this year compared with 4.9 per cent y-o-y growth in the preceding quarter.</p>
      <p>In a research note today, MIDF Research said moderation in private consumption in particular, as a result of higher base effect last year following a tax holiday, would contribute to the slower pace.</p>
      <p>“Nevertheless, robust net export and increasing government spending would partially cushion the impact,” it said.</p>
      <p>Overall, the research firm said Malaysia’s economic activities are predicted to continue expanding amid resilient domestic spending and challenging external trade performances.</p>
      <p>“Moving forward, we view continuous expansionary momentum, particularly with solid domestic demand, lower overnight policy rate effects, stable job market, low inflationary pressure and gradual pick-up of commodity prices this year.</p>
      <p>“On top of that, the easing monetary policy by major countries may act as a factor to push demand for goods,” it said.</p>
      <p>However, the research house noted that trade spat between the US and China remained a downside risk to export-oriented economies, including Malaysia’s.</p>
      <p>“The uncertainties over the US-China trade agreement persist as the duo have not signed anything yet,” it said. — Bernama</p>
