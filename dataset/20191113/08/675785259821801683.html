      <p>CM Punk will pocket a lucrative deal after announcing his sensational return to WWE - bringing an end to his five-year spell with the UFC.</p>
      <p>The WWE legend, a former two-time champion, stunned fans by making an unannounced appearance on Tuesday night’s episode of WWE Backstage, on FS1 in the US.</p>
      <p>Punk , 41, arrived as the show approached its conclusion and entered to the sounds of his iconic “Cult of Personality” entrance music which he used throughout his storied career.</p>
      <p>“It’s as simple as this: Just when they think they’ve got the answers, I change the culture,” Punk told the camera, before adding: “I’ll see you here next week.”</p>

      <p>It is not known yet whether Punk will be making a full-time return to in-ring action. But it is understood he will pocket a lucrative deal as part of his new role in WWE’s weekly studio-based show.</p>
      <p>Many, however, do expect Punk to step foot inside the squared circle again though.</p>
      <p>His name has reverberated around areas all over the world since his acrimonious exit from WWE back in 2014.</p>
      <p>He left the company under a cloud, insisting he had retired after citing a number of health issues while performing for the company.</p>
      <p>His unhappiness at the time was also said that have stemmed over his ‘stifled’ creative licence.</p>
      <p>He then made a highly-anticipated transition to the Octagon, signing a multi-fight deal with the UFC.</p>

      <p>He lost his first bout to Micky Gall in 2015 and last year was defeated by Mike Jackson. That effectively signalled the end of his MMA career after UFC chief Dana White announced Punk would probably never fight for the company again.</p>
      <p>He has since done commentary for Cage Fury Fighting Championship.</p>
      <p>But Punk was linked with a return to wrestling with WWE’s new rivals, All Elite Wrestling.</p>
      <p>Now he appears to be on course for a remarkable WWE in-ring comeback.</p>
      <p>A statement from WWE read: “CM Punk, one of the most celebrated WWE Superstars of all time, joins the roster of FS1's WWE Backstage, beginning next week, Tuesday Nov. 19.</p>

      <p>“Phil Brooks, better known as CM Punk, joins WWE Backstage as a special contributor and analyst. He will make select appearances in studio alongside host Renee Youngand analyst Booker T.</p>
      <p>"The Best in the World" joins fellow regular contributors Christianand Paige, as well as new correspondent Ryan Satin on the WWE Backstage rotation.</p>
      <p>“Television's only studio show devoted to all things WWE, Backstage discusses the week's biggest stories with a varied cast of guest and personalities, in addition to breaking news and exclusive behind-the-scenes access to WWE."</p>
      <p>Popular Punk, who is married to fellow WWE legend AJ Lee, holds the sixth longest WWE championship reign of all-time having held the title for an incredible 434 days between November 2010 and January 2013, when he was eventually beaten by The Rock at Royal Rumble.</p>
      <p>Now WWE fans will be clamouring to see him compete at the next Royal Rumble, early in 2020.</p>
