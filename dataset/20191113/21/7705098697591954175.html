      <h1>Disney+ Reveals Drop Dates For Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, and More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:19:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:19</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, Disney+ officially launched with most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films ready to stream. However, a few key chapters of the Infinity Saga are still on Netflix for at least the next few months. Regardless, Disney+ has already left fans know when the rest will arrive.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-plus-last-jedi-infinity-war-release-dates/">Comic Book Resources</a>, <b>Thor: Ragnarok</b> will arrive on Disney+ on December 5. On March 4, 2020, <b>Black Panther</b> will make its debut on Disney+.  <b>Avengers: Infinity War</b> will hit on June 25, 2020, before <b>Ant-Man and the Wasp</b> will follow on July 29, 2020. Unfortunately, there are no current plans for Sony to bring <b>Spider-Man: Homecoming</b> or <b>Spider-Man: Far From Home</b> to Disney+. Marvel’s <b>The Incredible Hulk</b> is also absent because it was produced with Universal Pictures.</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars</b> fans won’t have to wait too long for <b>The Last Jedi</b> to arrive. Disney+ will get that film on December 26. However, <b>Solo: A Star Wars Story</b> won’t arrive until July 9, 2020. Pixar’s <b>Incredbles 2</b> is also slated to make its Disney+ debut on July 30, 2020.</p>

      <p>Although there were technical difficulties on the first day of Disney+, Disney is reporting that 10 million subscribers have already joined the streaming service. Disney already made a deal with Verizon to let its users get a free year of Disney+. So it’s unclear how many of those subscribers received Disney+ for free. The bigger challenge for Disney+ will be converting those users into paid subscribers.</p>
