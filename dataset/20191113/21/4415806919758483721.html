      <h1>Gardaí investigating seven recent attacks on sex workers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:08:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/rebecca-stiffe/" target="_blank">By Rebecca Stiffe</a></address>
      <p>Gardaí are investigating a number of recent attacks on sex workers.</p>
      <p>Detectives attached to 'Operation Quest' are liasing with local Decetective Units in relation to the attacks, primarily in the Dublin area.</p>
      <p>Since mid October, there have been seven attacks across the country on sex workers advertising sexual services online.</p>
      <p>The motives for the attacks, Gardaí say, is monetary gain, though violence has been used and the incidents have been terrifying for the injured parties, both male and female.</p>
      <p>On each occasion, an online appointment is made, but when the 'client' arrives, the sex worker is attacked and robbed by a number of males.</p>
      <p>Gardaí say they are working closely with all injured parties involved in the incidents and are treating the victims with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.</p>
      <p>Gardaí are appealing to any sex worker who may have been subject to a similar attack to immediately report the incident and ensure that those who come forward will be treated confidentially with compassion and sensitivity.</p>
      <p>An Garda Síochána is appealing to any person with information on these targeted attacks to please contact Gardaí to assist in bringing these attackers to justice.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can contact the Garda Confidential Number 1800 666 111 or any Garda Station.</p>
      <p>A list of victim support groups are available through the Garda website <a href="https://www.garda.ie/en/Victim-Services/Where-else-can-I-get-support-/Victim-Support-Services.html">here</a>.</p>
