      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/NOEL-GALLAGHER">Noel Gallagher</a> has shared a snippet of a new song which is set to premiere tomorrow morning (November 14).</p>
      <p>The clip, which you can view below, is likely to be from a track from his forthcoming third EP. It will be showcased on Zoe Ball’s breakfast show on Radio 2 from 7am.</p>
      <p>Gallagher recently released <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/noel-gallagher-high-flying-birds-this-is-the-place-ep">the acclaimed ‘This Is The Place</a>‘ – the second of three EPs coming in 2019, following on from <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/noel-gallagher-black-star-dancing-ep-review">June’s ‘Black Star Dancing</a>‘.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/noel-gallagher-high-flying-birds-this-is-the-place-ep">Reviewing Gallagher’s Manchester-inspired ‘This is the Place’ EP, <i>NME</i> wrote</a>: “To quote Tony Walsh’s poem on the treasures of Manchester: <i>“It’s ace, it’s the best and the songs that we sing, from the stands, from our bands, set the whole planet shaking</i>”. While Gallagher’s done well to remember that, he’s gone back to his roots but taken them to strange new places.</p>
      <p>“Imagine what <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a> could have been if they’d have had the bravery to match this bombast in their latter years.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher also recently announced a <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-announces-huge-one-off-outdoors-london-gig-2020-2561896">huge one-off headline show</a> at London’s Kenwood House for 2020.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a> man recently conceded that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-would-rather-have-boris-johnson-as-his-brother-than-liam-2565434">he’d rather have Johnson than Liam for a brother</a>.</p>
      <p>“I would say Boris is more entertaining,” he said. “His use of the English language is more superior.”</p>
      <p>However, he was willing to admit that Liam would emerge triumphant in the beauty stakes.</p>
      <p>“Liam is better looking though,” he said. “I probably would not get on with either of them.”</p>
