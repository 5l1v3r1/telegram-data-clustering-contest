      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/undertale/38855"><i>Undertale</i></a><i> </i>creator and <i>Homestuck </i>composer Toby Fox <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20943435/undertale-developer-music-toby-fox-pokemon-sword-and-shield">did a track</a> for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-sword-shield/40501"><i>Pokémon</i><i> Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i></a><i> </i>and, upon listening to it, we’ve realized it sounds like it’s pulling a melody from a notorious <i>Homestuck</i>-related track: “The Baby is You.”</p>
      <p>The original track was made before Fox did official work for <i>Homestuck, </i>in response to a rule on the MS Paint Adventures forums that banned users from posting art of the characters being pregnant. (MS Paint Adventures was the website that hosted <i>Homestuck, </i>along with creator Andrew Hussie’s other works.) As the characters were 13 in the webcomic at the time, the forum didn’t want any <i>shenanigans</i>.</p>
      <p>Fox’s response was to make a short album about how Dave Strider, a character from the comic, is pregnant and the baby is main character John Egbert. If you think this doesn’t make sense, you’re right. It wasn’t really supposed to.</p>

      <p>The last part of the rock opera is what ended up getting used in the <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> track. You can hear it in a comparison video below.</p>

      <p>Fox is known for re-using melodies in his iconic songs. His extremely popular track, “Megalovania,” was originally used in a <i>EarthBound</i> hack mod, then used in <i>Homestuck</i>, and then used as Sans’ theme from <i>Undertale</i>. While fans of Fox know this, nobody quite expected him to use a melody from his most shitpost-y track ever made — especially not for <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i>. Of course, we don’t know if this is an intentional call-back to “The Baby is You,” or if it’s just similar in its melody.</p>
      <p>You can check out an animated video for the original “The Baby is You” track below, if you want to fall down that rabbit hole.</p>

      <p>With “Megalovania” making it into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch/40339"><i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i></a> and “The Baby is You” making it into <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>, it’s been a big year for Toby Fox and <i>Homestuck </i>fans.</p>
      <p><b>Update</b>: A previous version of this article said that Toby Fox was banned from the MS Paint Adventures forum for posting this song, but Marcy Nabors, a sound effect artist for the <i>Homestuck</i> game Hiveswap <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadolith/status/1194710849283379200">said Fox was not banned for posting the song</a>, and that Fox went on to use a private board on the forums, eventually leading to him working on <i>Homestuck</i>’s<i> </i>music. This post has been corrected to reflect this.</p>
