      <p>Pop princess Katy Perry rubbed shoulders with the Prince of Wales in India when she joined him for a meeting of his British Asian Trust (BAT).</p>
      <p>The singer, who appeared at a music festival in Mumbai this week, chatted to Charles as he took part in a BAT advisory board meeting at an exclusive hotel in the city.</p>
      <p>The US star said she wanted to know more about the work of the organisation founded in 2007 by Charles and a group of British Asian business leaders.</p>
      <p>It aims to tackle widespread poverty, inequality and injustice in south Asia.</p>
      <p>She said afterwards: “I heard about the work of the British Asian Trust through a friend in India and really wanted to come along to learn more about it.”</p>
      <p>The singer said she shared a similar ethos with the prince on sustainability and climate change.</p>
      <p>The trust has four areas of programme work – education, livelihoods, anti-trafficking and mental health, with a strong track record of investing in solutions that work for the long-term and that can be taken to scale.</p>
      <p>The organisation has supported more than four million people in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since its inception.</p>
