      <p>The two joined forces inside Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena for the 53rd annual CMA Awards to deliver a powerful performance of their duet “Love Me Anyway”.</p>
      <p>The piano ballad, which is featured on Pink’s latest album <i>Hurts 2B Human</i>, was their first televised performance of the song — and they did not disappoint.</p>

      <p>Backed by a piano and string instruments, the duo delivered flawless harmonies, making the performance as heartfelt as the track’s emotional lyrics.</p>
      <p>Kacey Mugraves, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and the rest of the crowd were all brought to their feet as they joined the standing ovation.</p>

      <p>This may have been their first televised performance of their collaboration, but back in June the two performed “Love Me Anyway” during Pink’s New York City concert at Madison Square Garden.</p>
