      <h1>SaskMusic announces 2019 awards nominees who are 'doing really great work'</h1>
      <h2>"It’s a nice way to recognize people for how hard they’re working,” said Amy Nelson, who's nominated for a 2019 Saskatchewan Music Award.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:24:35+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lpashleym" target="_blank">Ashley Martin</a></address>
      <p>Amy Nelson has been spending a fair bit of time in Australia these days, but she was glad to be home on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/music/1011-you-last-sask-pirate">The Regina country singer-songwriter</a> was among the nominees announced for the 2019 Saskatchewan Music Awards, which will be awarded in Saskatoon later this month.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited. … And anytime you’re nominated for something, it’s a nice way to recognize people for how hard they’re working,” said Nelson, who is one of five nominees for country artist of the year.</p>
      <p>“And there’s tons of artists out there that maybe weren’t even in the category that are working hard.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/first-ever-sask-music-awards-are-a-chance-to-celebrate-a-thriving-music-community">The purpose of founding the awards in 2018,</a> said SaskMusic executive director Mike Dawson, was to celebrate “all the great things artists are doing” in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>The second annual awards ceremony will be a continuation of that.</p>
      <p>“We want to recognize everyone, because everyone’s doing really great work,” said Dawson. “It does give us an opportunity to share a lot of stories, a lot of great things that are happening with artists, whether they’re winners or not in the province.”</p>
      <p>Nelson had a big summer in 2019, touring Australia for the 10th time and winning the CKRM Proudly Saskatchewan contest — which saw her perform at Country Thunder and have the opportunity to record with Open Road Recordings, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/eldest-hunter-brother-talks-craven-camaraderie-and-quick-turnarounds">home to artists like the Hunter Brothers</a> and Dean Brody.</p>

      <p>There are a few repeat nominees among the 13 categories announced Wednesday at The Artesian.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon indie-rock trio Close Talker — which is about to begin a North American tour <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/close-talker-puts-audience-virtually-centre-stage-in-3d-360-tour">(and had a cross-Canada tour earlier this year for its unique 3D-360 headphone concert)</a> — is up for alternative artist of the year <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/first-ever-sask-music-awards-winners-were-named-sunday-in-regina">(which it won last year),</a> rock/pop artist of the year, and producer of the year.</p>
      <p>Reignwolf, fronted by Saskatoon expat Jordan Cook, is nominated in the former two categories.</p>
      <p>Duchess of Dub is up for electronic artist of the year and Indigenous artist of the year. Eekwol and T-Rhyme are nominated in the latter category, too, and for hip hop artist of the year.</p>
      <p>Mario Lepage’s name appears in five awards categories: He’s up for producer of the year; <a href="https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/local-arts/ponteixs-new-album-of-expansive-music-is-inspired-by-lepages-prairie-home">his band Ponteix is nominated</a> for rock/pop artist of the year and alternative artist of the year; and, Dylan Hryciuk of Versa Films is twice nominated for creating two Ponteix music videos (“Petite Fleur” and “Faux Pas”).</p>
      <p>Music video of the year is a new category.</p>
      <p>The awards are “pretty special,” said Nelson. “It’s celebrating all of Saskatchewan, all genres. And I think there’s some really phenomenal things happening in the music (industry), coming from people from Saskatchewan.”</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Music Awards party takes place in Saskatoon at the Broadway Theatre on Nov. 28, 7 p.m. Tickets are available through <a href="https://www.veryprairie.ca/sask-music-awards-home-1">veryprairie.ca.</a></p>
      <p>Last year’s ceremony was in Regina. Dawson said the eventual goal is bring the celebration to other communities in the province.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely a hope that we can use it as an opportunity to celebrate what’s happening in the province, all over the province,” said Dawson.</p>
