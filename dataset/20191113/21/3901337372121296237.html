      <p>The FC Barcelona captain scored a treble in his side's 4-1 win over Celta Vigo last Saturday, with two of his goals coming from direct free-kicks, and the other from the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>That hat-trick was his 34th in LaLiga, <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/lionel-messi-equals-cristiano-ronaldo-laliga-record/667157">equalling Ronaldo's record</a>. However, overall, the Portuguese superstar still has two more trebles to his name.</p>
