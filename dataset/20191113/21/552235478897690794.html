      <p>Steve Cotterill was interviewed for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> job as the search continues for a new boss at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>The former Birmingham City manager held talks with owner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> in Edinburgh after applying to succeed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> .</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old has been out of work since being sacked by Birmingham in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Cotterill lifted the FA Trophy, a Conference title and won promotion to the old Second Division during a hugely successful five-year stint with Cheltenham Town from 1997.</p>

      <p>He won the League Two title in 2010 with Notts County and claimed a League One title and Football League trophy double with Bristol City in 2015. Cotterill’s also held the top jobs at Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Burnley and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stoke-city-fc">Stoke</a> .</p>
      <p>Hearts are understood to be in the first round of interviews, with Budge not expecting to finalise any appointment before the end of the current international break.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They are also actively searching for a sporting director.</p>
      <p>Felix Magath, Dougie Freedman, Neil Warnock, Graham Alexander and current interim Austin MacPhee have all been linked with the head coach position.</p>
