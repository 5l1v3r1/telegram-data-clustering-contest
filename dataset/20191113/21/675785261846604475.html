      <p>Tommy Fury had a lot of wooing to do after he left Molly-Mae Hague feeling jealous over his solo night out.</p>
      <p>But the self-confessed "smug" Love Island power couple, both 20, proved they were very much together on a cosy date night on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The boxer had done well as he whisked his girlfriend away to The Ivy Roof Garden, in Manchester for their swanky evening out.</p>
      <p>A happy Molly-Mae beamed for the camera while Tommy snapped the shot of her looking ultra glam for their date.</p>
      <p>She returned the favour as she took an equally dapper photograph of her love.</p>

      <p>Only Tuesday, the social media guru admitted she was feeling the pangs of jealousy when her boxer beau headed out to the ITV Palooza without her.</p>
      <p>Absent from the event, she penned: "Don't have too much fun without me." Molly-Mae accompanied the note with two sad emojis and a heart.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae and Tommy are arguably the power couple that come out of last year's Love Island.</p>

      <p>The blonde bombshell shared she couldn't help feeling a little "smug" that they outlasted almost every other Love Island relationship.</p>
      <p>BFFs Curtis Pritchard and Maura Higgins are the only other couple remaining from the series.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae and Tommy got a hard time from fans who accused her of only wanting to be with her love for the money.</p>

      <p>Now she's proved every single one of them wrong.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae told Mirror Online exclusively as she teamed up with Tatti Lashes to launch her own line of fake eyelashes: "I think I'd be wrong if I said it didn't give me a bit of a smug feeling because it does [that we have lasted].</p>
      <p>"And it's nice to be able to show everyone they were all wrong because they didn't believe in us and it's so nice to show that we were the realest couple in there and I think that's really shown since we've come out.</p>
      <p>"And Maura and Curtis were a bit rocky and now everyone else has broken up and we're the only couples who've remained and I could have told you that right from the start but no one would listen to me and wanted to say I was fake.</p>
      <p>"I saw Amber [Gill] the other day and it's sad what happened, but she would have told you herself that Tommy and I were the winners, it's a hard one because everyone knows Tommy and I were the winners in a way but everything happens for a reason and we didn't need to win the show to prove what we've got because everyone can see it now and we're so happy, but maybe we wouldn't have been if we'd won, you just never know."</p>
