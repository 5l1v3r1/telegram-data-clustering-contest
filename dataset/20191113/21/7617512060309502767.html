      <p>In the market for a new vehicle? You are not alone. Many people on Vancouver Island are looking for a new set of wheels, for many different reasons.</p>
      <p>This is a good time to be checking out your options. Dealers selling cars, truck and SUVs say that this is a slow time of year, which means you have a better chance of finding the perfect new ride on a local lot.</p>
      <p>Dave Obee, the publisher of the Times Colonist, says there are 10 major reasons to consider a new vehicle purchase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A new (or newer) vehicle will likely have lower maintenance costs, saving you money in the long run.</li>
        <li>Newer vehicles are better for the environment. Lower gas consumption and reduced emissions will make a difference for all of us.</li>
        <li>Charge it. We are all going to go electric eventually. Odds are you will not be the first on your block to pull the plug on gasoline (sorry, we couldn’t resist) but you would still be ahead of most.</li>
        <li>Open air, the wind in your hair, and all that. Why not a convertible? Is there a better time to buy one?</li>
        <li>New cars have many more safety features. You could be warned of unsafe lane changes, you will be able to get a clear view when you back up, and your vehicle might even help you stop when you need to.</li>
        <li>Kids grown? Still need that van? Probably not. Trade it on something smaller. You have earned it. Just make sure to clean the crayon marks for the next owner.</li>
        <li>Need a van? Well, we just encouraged someone else to trade one in, and it is waiting for you, ready for fresh crayon marks.</li>
        <li>Comfort counts in the Colwood crawl. Your personal space can make the different between a miserable drive – “will this ever end?” – and a quiet, peaceful time. Wouldn’t you rather arrive at the office or at home in a more relaxed state of mind?</li>
        <li>That leads us to technology. New cars have more of it, and it is more reliable than before. Enjoy the leading edge again.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, it’s just nice to have a new vehicle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Put all of this together, and it is hard to argue with the notion of a new car.</p>
      <p>But what is the best way to find one? You can go from lot to lot, or check out the websites of your favorite dealers. What if the car of your dreams is on a lot that you did not think to check? A missed opportunity!</p>
      <p>“That is why we launched autos.timescolonist.com,” Obee says. “It is one-stop shopping for most dealers in our readership area. By searching for specific makes and models, you can find the vehicle you want no matter which lot it is on.”</p>
      <p>You can narrow your search to new or used, year, make, model, location, and price, and sort your results in a variety of ways.</p>
      <p>Obee says it is also possible to search the TC database by dealership. The site includes major new car dealerships as well as smaller lots dealing only in used vehicles – and one of those vehicles might be just the one you need.</p>
      <p>The autos.timescolonist.com site makes it easier than ever before to find your next vehicle. It’s quick, it’s easy, and it’s free, so you will not need to spend hours going from lot to lot or even from website to website. We have taken the work out finding vehicles.</p>
      <p>So get moving – and within a matter of hours you could be moving in a much sweeter ride than you have right now.</p>
