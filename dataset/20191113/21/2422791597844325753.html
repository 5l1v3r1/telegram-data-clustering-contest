      <p>“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to extended family time towards the end of this month,” a spokesperson for the Royal Family wrote in a statement to CTVNews.ca.</p>
      <p>"This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10333855/harry-meghan-decline-queen-sandringham-invitation/">A royal source told The Sun U.K</a>. that the family needs “time away to recharge and decide their plans for next year.”</p>
      <p>It is not clear where exactly they would spend the holidays, whether it be in the United States, the United Kingdom or elsewhere. The spokesperson declined to provide further details on the family’s holiday plans, citing security concerns.</p>
      <p>In September, Harry and Meghan skipped an annual royal holiday gathering known as Balmoral. Meghan instead opted for a flight to New York to watch Serena Williams and Canadian Bianca Andreescu in the U.S. Open women’s tennis final.</p>
