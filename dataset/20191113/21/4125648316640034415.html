      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (11:00 P.M.) – For the second night in a row, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Syrian Arab Army (SAA) are attempting to advance west of Tal Tamr and retake the areas they lost earlier in the week to the Turkish-backed militants.</p>

      <p>Tal Tamr has been the primary target for the Turkish-backed troops since they captured the key border city of Ras Al-‘Ayn at the start of Operation Peace Spring last month.</p>
      <p>Lastly, while they have launched several attacks to capture the town, the Turkish-backed militants have been unable to achieve any major breakthroughs until they captured these hills near Tal Tamr.</p>
