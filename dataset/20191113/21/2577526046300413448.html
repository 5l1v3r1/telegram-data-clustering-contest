      <h1>Duelling Translations of Hideo Kojima's Thoughts on Critics Cause Confusion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:08:28+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:08</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Grayson</a></address>
      <p>Whatever you think about Hideo Kojima’s latest fever dream – which imagines a world <i>exactly </i>like our own, except that Norman Reedus can’t walk good – you likely figured it was going to be divisive. Initial reviews lent credence to that idea; some critics adored <i>Death Stranding </i>despite its sharp corners and long, uneventful stretches. Others thought Kojima sacrificed fun in favour of nonsensical high-concept wankery. Over the weekend, Kojima voiced his own opinion about those reviews. Trouble is, nobody’s entirely sure what he meant.</p>
      <p>The saga of Kojima’s comments on American <i>Death Stranding </i>reviews is nearly as labyrinthine as the saga of <i>Death Stranding</i> itself. It began with <a href="https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/mastergame/extra/con-death-stranding-hideo-kojima-vuole-combattere-lodio-sui-social-il-momento-di-riconnetterci_10867138-201902a.shtml">an interview with Italian site <i>Tgcom24</i></a> over the weekend. English-speaking site <i>Wccftech </i>then <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-death-stranding-had-stronger-criticism-in-the-us-possibly-because-it-flies-above-shooters/">wrote a piece</a> based on the Italian transcription – though not the original Japanese recording – of Kojima’s quote. In it, the site posited that he had said <i>Death Stranding </i>wasn’t able to strand its way into US audiences’ hearts because it’s not a first-person shooter. Instead, <i>Wccftech </i>said Kojima said, it’s something better.</p>
      <p>“I must say that the game received rave reviews, especially in Europe and Japan,” said Kojima, according to <i>Wccftech</i>’s translation. “Here in the United States, however, we have had stronger criticisms. Perhaps it is a difficult game to understand for a certain type of critic and audience. Americans are great fans of first-person shooters and <i>Death Stranding</i> isn’t one, it flies higher.”</p>
      <p>He went on to compare American audiences to those of other countries, saying (again according to <i>Wccftech</i>) that he always aims to create new things that garner discussion, but “Italians or the French have a different artistic sensibility that allows them to appreciate this kind of very original product, not only in video games but also in cinema.”</p>
      <p>That “flies higher” bit, especially, is quite an audacious statement.<i> Death Stranding</i> is ambitious, sure, but more so than every entry in a genre that’s sprouted countless branches over the course of decades? Naturally, this created quite a fuss among fans – some of whom wound up disputing <i>Wccftech</i>’s translation. Major sites like <i>IGN </i><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/12/heres-what-kojima-said-about-mixed-death-stranding-reviews">proceeded to weigh in with translations</a> that put a different slant on Kojima’s assessment, removing his declaration that <i>Death Stranding</i> “flies higher.” Instead, according to <i>IGN</i>, Kojima merely stated that “Americans are some of the biggest first-person shooter fans, and <i>Death Stranding</i> isn’t that.” In other words, it’s unfamiliar  not necessarily better or worse.</p>
      <p>Then Sony itself got in on the action, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-death-stranding-had-stronger-criticism-in-the-us-possibly-because-it-flies-above-shooters/">re-translating that last line</a> as “in America there are a lot of FPS fans, maybe those fans are saying this is like a different game and are not rating it very high.” So more or less the same meaning as <i>IGN</i>’s, albeit with additional flavour and context. It’s unclear whether they accessed Kojima’s original Japanese or not.</p>
      <p><i>Kotaku</i>’s Natalie Degraffinried, who speaks Italian, also took a crack at translating the quote. Here’s what she came up with:</p>
      <blockquote>“I have to say that the game has received enthusiastic reviews, especially in Europe and Japan. Here in the United States, however, we’ve received stronger criticisms. Maybe it’s a difficult game to understand for a certain type of critic and the public. In America, there are many fans of first-person shooters, and a lot of them [wish] that <i>Death Stranding</i> [were] a different game; maybe for that [reason], they didn’t give higher scores.”<br/><br/>“I always look to create new things and [welcome] controversy and discussion, but it must be said that the Italians and the French have a diverse sensibility that allows them to appreciate this more original genre of product, [not only] in video games but also in film.”</blockquote>
      <p>No matter how you slice it, it seems Kojima made some pretty broad generalisations. Translation, however, is a tricky art, and it often leaves room for interpretation. This is an important thing to keep in mind not only when reading quotes from Kojima – who has <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/09/23/of-course-hideo-kojimas-japanese-tweets-are-more-accurate">found himself in situations like this before</a> – but anybody who isn’t speaking the language their words will ultimately be printed in. We’ll provide an update if we can get our hands on the original Japanese quote.</p>
