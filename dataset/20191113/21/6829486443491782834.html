      <h1>Violent Soho Are Back With Mournful New Track ‘A-OK’, Their First In Three Years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:40:15+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/tag/violent-soho">Violent Soho</a>, one of the most exciting acts in the alternate rock scene, have been quiet for some time now.</p>
      <p>The last we heard from the band, they were releasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_(album)"><i>Waco</i></a>, their big, filthy, heartbreaking collection of hooks, a rock record with an uncommon amount of emotional maturity.</p>
      <p>That was way back in 2016. A lot has happened since then, both in Australia and abroad. Things have gotten scarier in the world of politics, the environment has started to fall apart, and our mounting sense of apathy has begun to solidify.</p>

      <p>So maybe it’s not surprising that the first Violent Soho track in some three years is a quiet, raw paean to trying to stay calm in the midst of genuine horror. A series of gently howled vocals, a swirling melody line, and a repeated curse of a chorus, it’s Violent Soho at their most hurt and honest.</p>
      <p>It’s not quite clear what this means for the future of the band. The optimistic would probably assume that a new record are on the way. But hey, this could always be a one-and-done kinda deal. In which case, let’s drink this thing up.</p>
      <p>Hear the whole song below.</p>
