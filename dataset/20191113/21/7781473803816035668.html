      <h1>Formula 1 plans to become carbon neutral by 2030</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:25:39+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Formula 1 recently announced their <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/formula-1-reveals-2021-car-and-regulations/">new rules and regulations for the 2021 season of racing</a>, including the fact that the sport is committed to using a fuel mix that consists of petrol with 10 percent biofuel. This is only the first step towards the sport going green. Formula 1 has now announced its rather ambitious plan to move to a carbon neutral future by 2030. The initiative includes F1 cars, on track activity, and the sports overall operation as a whole.</p>

      <p>F1's 2030 plans have come about after a lot of work and continuous discussion between the FIA, Formula 1 teams, the sport's partners and promoters, and sustainability experts. While the focus on carbon reduction is meant to start right now, the long-term goal of going carbon neutral is going to be a slower process. Before reaching that milestone, F1 plans to be fully sustainable by 2025.</p>
      <p>While detailed plans for F1 2030 are yet to be revealed, the Formula 1 website currently states that in addition to "the plans to eliminate the carbon footprint of the F1 car and the on-track activities, initiatives will include action to ensure F1 moves to ultra-efficient logistics and travel and 100% renewably powered offices, facilities and factories."</p>
      <p>However, by 2025, Formula 1 will use sustainable materials, will ban single-use plastic, and will also ensure that waste is reduced, recycled or composted. Additional incentives are being planned, including offering fans a green option of transport to the racetracks.</p>
      <p>Formula 1 has used turbo hybrid power-units since 2014, and is set to continue to use this type of engine till the end of the 2025 season. From the 2026 season onwards, there will be a new engine specification that will be a step-up in terms of efficiency. For 2030, the owners of Formula 1 are hoping to have the world's first net-zero carbon internal combustion engine.</p>
