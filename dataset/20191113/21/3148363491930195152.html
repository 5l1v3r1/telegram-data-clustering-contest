      <h1>Schiff Closes Impeachment Hearing Denying Knowledge of 'Whistleblower'</h1>
      <h2>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) closed Wednesday’s public impeachment hearing by denying any knowledge of the identity of the so-called “whistleblower,” whose complaint sparked the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.</h2>

      <p>Schiff concluded Wednesday’s impeachment hearing with a final denial of any knowledge of the identity of the “whistleblower” – a denial he initially made after Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/adam-schiff-i-do-not-know-the-identity-of-the-whistleblower/">stated</a> that Schiff was the “only member” who knows the identity of the individual.</p>
      <p>“I do not know the identity of the whistleblower, and I’m going to make sure that identity is protected,” Schiff initially responded:</p>

      <p>Jordan continued to drive the point home throughout the hearing.</p>
      <p>Schiff said he wanted to “just conclude by saying, because I can’t let it go unanswered, some of my colleagues made the statement repeatedly that I met with the whistleblower, that I know who the whistleblower is.”</p>
      <p>“It was false the first time they said. It was false the second through 40th time they said it, and it will be false the last time they say it. With that, this concludes this portion of the hearing,” he added:</p>
