      <h1>Stephen Colbert, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> Disciple, Is Taking His Show to New Zealand and Back Again</h1>

      <p>Helpful life hack: Devote the majority of your life to passionately reading and loving a literary franchise, and then convince your late-show show that you <i>have </i>to visit the place the movie adaptations were filmed. Seems simple to us! <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/05/stephen-colbert-late-show-ratings-fallon-kimmel.html">Stephen Colbert</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/12/stephen-colbert-flexes-his-lord-of-the-rings-knowledge.html">a noted fanboy</a> of anything remotely associated with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-maps.html"><i>Lord of the Rings</i></a><i>, </i>has taken <i>The Late Show </i>to New Zealand for a week of shows — and all of the episodes will begin airing on Monday, November 18. Among other activities, Colbert secured a coveted interview with Peter Jackson and they’ll be filming a <i>LoTR </i>“spinoff” together (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r21CMDyPuGo">one does not simply</a> film a spinoff), and he’ll also do segments with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Lucy Lawless, Bret McKenzie, and the country’s national rugby team. My precious, precious Colbert, how fun this will be.</p>
