      <p>Windows 10, version 1803, also known as the April 2018 Update, has now reached end of service for Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations editions, and will no longer receive any future quality and security updates.</p>
      <p>As Microsoft said in October when it <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-1803-users-warned-to-update-before-end-of-support/">warned users to update their Windows 10 1803 devices</a> before end of support, customers who want to continue receiving quality updates should update to the latest version of Windows.</p>
      <p>Redmond also <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-information/windows-message-center#373">states</a> that an automatic feature update to May 2019 Update will be initiated on Windows 10 1803 devices that reached end of service to allow them to continue receiving updates.</p>
      <p>For Windows 10 devices that are at, or within several months of reaching end of service, Windows Update will automatically initiate a feature update (with users having the ability to choose a convenient time); keeping those devices supported and receiving the monthly updates that are critical to device security and ecosystem health. - Microsoft</p>
      <h3>Some security updates might still trickle in</h3>
      <p>However, very rarely, Microsoft might still release security updates for critical vulnerabilities that could potentially have a major impact on no longer serviced Windows versions such as Windows 10 1803.</p>
      <p>This already happened this year, for instance, when the company issued <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fixes-critical-remote-desktop-flaw-blocks-worm-malware/">a security update for the no longer supported Windows XP and Windows Server 2003</a> to patch the wormable Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability dubbed BlueKeep and tracked as CVE-2019-0708, a flaw discovered in the Remote Desktop Services (RDS) platform.</p>
      <p>It is strongly recommended that users install the Windows 10 1903 update since "if a device is out of service, it is no longer receiving quality updates from Microsoft and may become more vulnerable to security risks and viruses," as Redmond said in September.</p>
      <p>"A single exploited device can reveal other devices on a network, revealing otherwise secure information or spreading malware to other computers in the network."</p>

      <p>The Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 10, version 1803 are the next editions to go out of service on November 10, 2020.</p>
      <h3>Windows 10 safeguard holds for some devices</h3>
      <p>However, as Microsoft's Windows lifecycle fact sheet <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">notes</a> that "Not all features in an update will work on all devices. A device may not be able to receive updates if the device hardware is incompatible, lacks current drivers, lacks sufficient storage space, or is otherwise outside the original equipment manufacturer’s (OEM) support period."</p>
      <p>In these cases, the feature update will not be initiated on Windows 10, version 1803 devices that are not compatible with the latest version of Windows 10.</p>
      <p>If Windows Update will not offer to upgrade their systems, customers will have to review the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications">Windows 10 System Requirements</a> and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements">Windows Processor Requirements</a> to check if their devices match these requirements.</p>

      <p>Users should also know that there still are four compatibility holds active preventing some devices to upgrade to Windows 10, version 1903:</p>
