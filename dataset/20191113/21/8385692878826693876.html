      <p>Google Shopping <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">currently</a> has a pretty insane deal on the Xbox One X Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Bundle. It's currently just $347.40.</p>
      <p>And you won't see it any cheaper when Black Friday comes in around in about two weeks time.</p>
      <p>It's currently listed on Google Shopping for $499, but if you use the promo code <b>UGMBKO </b>at checkout, it'll drop down to just $347.40. That's a price that you really can't ignore.</p>

      <p>The Xbox One X is slated to go on sale for as low as $350 during Black Friday, but that's just the console. Which doesn't come with a game. This bundle includes a very popular game in the Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. And if you're a Star Wars fan, then this is definitely worth getting.</p>
      <p>Xbox One X is the most powerful gaming console currently on the market. You're not going to find anything better right now. There are new consoles coming out next year, so it's possible that you might see these drop a bit lower after Christmas. But if you are looking for something to put under the tree this year, this is the one to get.</p>
      <p>With the Xbox One X, you're going to be able to game and watch content in 4K and HDR. So you're going to get a really great picture out of this, and it's going to double as a set-top box. So instead of buying a Roku or a Fire TV, you can use your Xbox One X. It's able to pull double duty.</p>

      <p>There are a ton of great games available on Xbox, and there's also Game Pass. Which is sort of like the Netflix of gaming. Allowing you to play hundreds of different games for a monthly subscription.</p>
