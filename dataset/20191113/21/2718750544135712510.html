      <p>It was couples game night at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/vulture-festival-2019-highlights.html">Vulture Festival</a> this year and we had <i>The Bachelor</i>’s Colton Underwood and Cassie Randolph in our video studio just before the competition to be insufferably cute in front of comedian Jamie Loftus. There was one thing everyone (including <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/07/13/channing-tatum-goes-on-bizarre-rant-about-personality-app-pattern/">Channing Tatum</a>) seems to agree on though: the Pattern app is listening to us. Always listening.</p>
