      <h1>Kotoko terminate Zachariassen's contract</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:17:40+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:17</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Asare, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA - Asante Kotoko has terminated the contract of Norwegian coach Kjetil Zachariassen with no compensation.</p>
      <p>The termination clause was triggered after failure to meet his set targets in his contract which stated that, the Porcupine Warriors should at least make it to the group stages of Africa's two club competitions (Confederation Cup and Champions League).</p>
      <p>A club statement signed by its Chief Executive Officer, George Amoako said, ''This letter serves a formal notice that your employment with Asante Kotoko has been terminated as of 13th November, 2019.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is a final decision and is not subject to review. If you recall, Clause 7 of your Employment contract set performance target for you which included but not limited to the club reaching at least the group stages of the Champions League and the Confederations Cup competition, which were set out particularly in the sub clause 7.1.4.1 and 7.1.5 respectively,'' the statement said.</p>
      <p>The statement stated that, there would be no compensation after the contract termination with outstanding October salary to be honoured soon.</p>
      <p>Information gathered by GNA Sports indicates that, Johnson Smith who was Zachariassen's assistant is expected to take charge of team as they prepare for the upcoming season.</p>
