Non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.09 a share. <br/><br/>Wall Street was expecting revenue of $1.38 billion for the fiscal second quarter with non-GAAP earnings of 94 cents a share. <br/><br/>CEO George Kurian said the company will maintain discipline with its spending. <br/><br/>As for the outlook, NetApp projected $1.39 billion to $1.54 billion, or $1.14 a share to $1.22 a share. For the third quarter, Wall Street was expecting non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents a share on revenue of $1.47 billion.</p>
