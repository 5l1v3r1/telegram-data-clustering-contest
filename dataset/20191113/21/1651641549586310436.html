      <h1>With the November 2019 Update, Microsoft plots to kill My People</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:16:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:16</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>In a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/planning/windows-10-deprecated-features">list of technologies and features Microsoft is deprecatin</a>g with the Windows 10 November 2019 Update is tucked away an item both familiar and largely unknown to most Windows 10 users.</p>
      <p>In their list, Microsoft says they are deprecating the My People app and shell extension, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>My People is no longer being developed. It may be removed in a future update.</blockquote>
      <p>My People was introduced with the Fall Creators Update and was meant to be <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/how-to-use-my-people-to-multi-task-with-skype-and-telegram-on-windows-10/">a central hub for your frequently used contacts,</a> allowing you to quickly initiate a conversation with your friends, fellow employees or loved ones at a click of a button, particularly if you pin their heads to your taskbar.</p>

      <p>In the end though, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/447939/its-about-time-microsoft-is-finally-killing-my-people/">how to geek</a> notes:</p>
      <blockquote>In practice, very few apps have integrated with it. Even Microsoft’s own apps like Windows 10’s integrated SMS feature, Microsoft Teams, LinkedIn, Yammer, and Xbox Live Chat have ignored it. And, if Microsoft is ignoring it, why would popular services like Facebook bother using it? That lack of developer support makes the feature largely useless.</blockquote>
      <p>The death of the technology is at the same hands as most of Microsoft’s new user interface computing efforts – lack of full buy-in from Microsoft and lack of significant support from developers. With neither, any attempt of Microsoft to innovate are simply doomed to fail.</p>
