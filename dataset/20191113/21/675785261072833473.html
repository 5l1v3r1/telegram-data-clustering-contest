      <p>Liam Gallagher knows a thing or two about toxic politics as he and his brother Noel continue to swap insults.</p>
      <p>Before their spat, the Oasis lads famously backed Labour in 1997.</p>
      <p>But, Liam will be voting for the Green Party in next month’s election.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s the only party that makes sense”.</p>
      <p>The rocker has seen first-hand the destruction caused by climate change after being caught up in the Los Angeles wildfires on his Why Me? Why Not? tour last month.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the Mirror as he backed our climate edition, Liam, 47, says: “I’m voting for the Green Party: the rest of them are all selfish and clueless.</p>
      <p>“I’m a big fan of David Attenborough and watching his show on the Antarctic recently was really sad.</p>
      <p>“It’s worrying. We need to do more to make this world a more healthy environment to live in.”</p>

      <p>Liam is dad to Molly, 21, Lennon, 19, and Gene ,17, who he reckons are way more “clued up” than he ever was about climate issues.</p>
