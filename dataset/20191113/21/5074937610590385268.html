      <h1>AFCON 2021 qualifiers preview: Ghana vs South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:13:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:13</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Appiah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov.13, GNA - After the disappointing round of 16 elimination from the  2019 Africa Cup of Nation(AFCON) in Egypt, the Black Stars of Ghana will be playing their competitive  game as they commence as the 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign at home to South Africa.</p>
      <p>The big game would be held at the 15,000 seater Cape Coast Sports Stadium on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ghana is in Group C with one time champions South Africa, Sudan and Sao Tome and Principe, but the Black Stars looked favorites to top the group because of their excellent record in AFCON qualifies, having failed only once in 1990.</p>
      <p>Coach Kwesi Appiah's men would be hoping for a flying start to redeem their trust from Ghanaians following the launch of the #Bring Back TheLove campaign by the new administration of the Ghana Football Association (GFA).</p>
      <p>Andre Dede Ayew, Captain of the Black Stars, has said prior to the big game that, the team would have to give their all to get the positive results to help reignite the passion of football in the country.</p>
      <p>Ghana, the four times Africa champions, has upper hand record over Bafana Bafana having recorded three victories in their last  six competitive match with two defeats and one draw.</p>
      <p>The last time the two Africa giants met was in the 2015 AFCON where the  Black Stars ran out 2-1 winners and Coach Appiah's men will be confident of securing a win at home against the Bafana's.</p>
      <p>Coach Kwesi Appiah had called up seven new faces to his squad including AshantiGold striker Shafiu Mumuni, Spanish based players Mohammed Salisu and Iddrisu Baba.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the 1996 AFCON champions South Africa had a good tournament in the 2019 AFCON as they defeated host nation Egypt to reach the quarter finals, but they would face their toughest challenge of their qualifying group first as they travel to face group favourites, Ghana.</p>
      <p>However, South Africa will be looking to take inspiration from the 2000 AFCON match against the Black Stars which Bafana won 1-0 in the Ghanaian city of Kumasi.</p>
      <p>Coach Molefi Ntseki had stated how he sees a point as a good result and it would be no shock if they played with a defensive mindset with the onus on Ghana to break them down.</p>
      <p>Expectations would be high for Ghana as they start their qualifying campaign against South Africa, who are likely to be their closest rivals in the group but coach Appiah's charges look favorite to run the day with a narrow victory.</p>
