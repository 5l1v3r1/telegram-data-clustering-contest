      <h1>Modric wins Golden Foot award</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T21:57:56+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Luka Modric is the proud recipient of the 2019 Golden Foot, the award which is bestowed to the best player in the world over the age of 29.</p>
      <p>Modric became the latest player to land the prize after excelling with Real Madrid and Croatia in the recent past, most notably by finishing runner-up at the 2018 World Cup which played a part in him winning the Ballon dâ€™Or.</p>
      <p>However, 2019 was hardly a vintage year for the 34-year-old midfielder as Madrid finished third in La Liga, were dumped out of the Champions League round-of-16 by Ajax and lost their Copa del Rey semifinal to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Still, the winner is decided by an online vote after an international jury selects nominees, so the people have spoken.</p>
      <p>Modric flew out to Monaco to collect his prize, thus becoming the 17th player to do so since the inaugural Golden Foot was given to Roberto Baggio in 2003.</p>
