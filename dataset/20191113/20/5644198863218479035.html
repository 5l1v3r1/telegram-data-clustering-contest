      <p>Wall Street's main indexes turned slightly higher on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank saw a "sustained expansion" ahead for the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 posted record closing highs on Wednesday helped by a big jump in Walt Disney shares, but the Nasdaq fell as stocks were kept in check by fresh uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations.</p>
      <p>The Wall Street Journal reported during the session that U.S.-China trade negotiations have hit a snag over farm purchases, the latest development in a dispute between the two countries that has convulsed markets for more than a year.</p>

      <p>The three indexes had all drifted higher earlier in the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said U.S. central bankers see a "sustained expansion" ahead for the country's economy.</p>
      <p>Stocks have recently climbed to record levels, fueled by Fed interest rate cuts, third-quarter earnings exceeding low expectations and signs the economy is bottoming. But questions about an initial agreement to help resolve the U.S.-China trade dispute remain a key wild card.</p>
      <p>“It’s still about China and investors trying to decide whether there’s a deal coming or not," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>"It’s really left investors uncertain," Meckler said. "They don’t want to sell into a possible announced deal, but they also don’t want to get whipsawed by, again, some disappointment over it."</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 92.1 points, or 0.33per cent, to 27,783.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.2 points, or 0.07per cent, to 3,094.04 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.99 points, or 0.05per cent, to 8,482.10.</p>
      <p>Among the S&amp;P 500 sectors, traditionally defensive groups such as utilities , real estate and consumer staples ended sharply positive, while cyclical sectors, such as financials , energy and materials , which are known for tracking the health of the economy, lagged.</p>
      <p>"The leadership today is defensive," said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist with Allianz Global Investors.</p>
      <p>Investors also had their eyes on geopolitical developments, including presidential impeachment hearings in the United States and protests in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Walt Disney Co shares jumped 7.3per cent after the media company said its new streaming service, Disney+, had reached 10 million sign-ups since launching the previous day. Disney shares provided the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&amp;P 500.</p>
      <p>Shares of streaming rival Netflix Inc sank 3.0per cent.</p>
      <p>SmileDirectClub Inc shares slumped 20.3per cent after the teeth alignment company reported a bigger quarterly loss.</p>
      <p>About three-fourths of S&amp;P 500 companies have topped earnings estimates in their third-quarter reports, but the companies are still expected to have posted an overall 0.5per cent decline in earnings, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 124 new lows.</p>
      <p>About 6.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, roughly in line with the daily average over the last 20 sessions.</p>
