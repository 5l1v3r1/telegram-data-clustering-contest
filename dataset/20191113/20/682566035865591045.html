      <p>London - <b>England </b>manager <b>Gareth Southgate</b> brushed aside criticism of his decision to drop <b>Raheem Sterling </b>over an altercation with Joe Gomez, saying he does not resolve problems by thinking how he can please everybody.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old decided to drop Manchester City forward Sterling for Thursday's Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro after he clashed with Liverpool defender Gomez on Monday at England's training centre.</p>
      <p>Sterling admitted he had let his emotions get the better of him just 24 hours after Liverpool beat City 3-1 to extend their Premier League lead over the defending champions to nine points.</p>
      <p>Southgate has largely been praised for taking action quickly, although former England defender Rio Ferdinand was among the pundits who said it should have been kept behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Southgate, whose side can seal their place at Euro 2020 with a draw in what is their 1,000th international, said he had taken the decision in the best interests of the team.</p>
      <p>"Everyone will have an opinion on the decisions you take and only those who have been involved in the environment will know the details of it," he said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"If you are only going to try and make decisions that keep everyone happy that is not going to work either.</p>
      <p>"The team is always my priority."</p>
      <p>Southgate, who described his squad on Wednesday as being like a family, said the team will be able to cope without Sterling's presence, although he will be available again for Sunday's clash in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Sterling has been one of the stars of England's qualification campaign, scoring eight goals in six games.</p>
      <p>"Raheem is an excellent player who has been in great form, but we will put out a team full of technical ability and passion and enthusiasm," said Southgate.</p>
      <p>"Everyone in the squad is ready. It is hardly ever any different.</p>
      <p>"We want to focus fully on the match and from our first football meeting yesterday morning that has been our sole focus and we are looking to get on with it."</p>
