      <h1>As Proteas seek recovery, Linde putting hand up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:26:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">Lloyd Burnard - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - With the <b>Proteas</b> in a world of trouble following a worrying few months of shocking results, South African cricket is crying out for quality depth as it looks to recover and become a force in the global game once more. </p>
      <p>With the likes of Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn, JP Duminy, AB de Villiers and Imran Tahir (from ODI cricket) having now all moved on, the national set-up has lost a large chunk of experience and ability. </p>
      <p>A seventh-place finish at the 2019 Cricket World Cup came after a 2-0 Test series loss at home to Sri Lanka and before another disastrous trip to India where the Proteas were hammered 3-0 as they slipped to five straight Test match losses for only the second time in their history. </p>
      <p>There have obviously been very few individual success stories along the way. </p>
      <p>One man who is in the form of his life and feeling on top of the world at the moment, however, is <b>George Linde</b>.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old left-arm orthodox spinner has been a consistent performer at the Cape Cobras for a number of seasons now, and a string of impressive domestic returns in 2018/19 saw him included in an SA 'A' side that travelled to India earlier in the year. </p>
      <p>He was still as shocked as anyone, though, when an injury to Keshav Maharaj saw him flown into Ranchi and straight into the team for the third Test against India for a Test debut last month. </p>
      <p>It was completely unexpected, but Linde showed with figures of <b>4/133</b> and two gritty knocks of <b>37 </b>and <b>27</b> that he was comfortable on the biggest stage. </p>
      <p>"It's amazing," Linde told Cape Town media on Wednesday when asked what it was like to have a Proteas Test cap at his house in Brackenfell. </p>
      <p>"I haven't seen it since I got back home yet because I put it in the safe. It's not going anywhere, so whenever I get my call-up again, I will get it out."</p>
      <p>Linde says he is more confident in his own ability now than ever before, and it shows in the numbers. </p>
      <p>In his first match back for the Cobras after the India series, Linde carded his highest-ever first-class score when he knocked <b>122</b> in a superb innings against the Warriors in Cape Town. </p>
      <p>He then smashed <b>24* (13)</b> in the Mzansi Super League opener against the Jozi Stars for the Cape Town Blitz and followed that up with <b>3/23 </b>in a losing cause against the Paarl Rocks this past weekend. </p>
      <p>"I feel quite good with bat and ball, but I try not to overthink anything when I train," he said. </p>
      <p>"You never know when this form might go down again, so I'm just trying to ride the wave."</p>
      <p>Linde credits the work of Cobras and Cape Town Blitz coach <b>Ashwell Prince</b> in helping him take his game to a new level.</p>
      <p>"I feel my body language has changed quite a lot from last season. I believe in myself a little bit more now and I see I can actually play on that level," Linde said. </p>
      <p>"It's all about the body language and showing that I am here to play.</p>
      <p>"Three or four years ago when he (Prince) arrived I probably didn't even think about playing for the Proteas, now it is there."</p>
      <p>When England arrive for four Tests in December, the Proteas will almost certainly back Maharaj as their first-choice spinner. </p>
      <p>Linde, though, has surely now moved ahead of Dane Piedt in the pecking order. </p>
      <p>His batting form in recent months, meanwhile, has revealed an ability to hit long balls and clear the ropes with ease. </p>
      <p>With a T20 World Cup on the cards in Australia next September, Linde is emerging as an attractive option. </p>
      <p>It has all happened rather suddenly, but given where South African cricket is at the moment, the emergence of Linde as an option will be welcomed with open arms. </p>
      <p>He will next be in action when the Blitz host the Jozi Stars at Newlands on Thursday. </p>
      <p>Play starts at <b>17:30</b> and tickets are selling at <b>R30</b>. </p>
