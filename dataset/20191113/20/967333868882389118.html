        <b>The US rapper earlier pleaded guilty to lying on multiple occasions on forms for firearm background checks as he sought to obtain additional guns for his arsenal, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rapper Kodak Black was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison out of a possible maximum of 10 by a Miami federal judge for violating gun regulations on several occasions. The judge listened to the state prosecutor's request for a prison term of between 46 and 57 months when making the decision.</p>
      <p>21-year-old Bill K. Kapri, better known under his stage name Kodak Black, pleaded guilty to lying on firearm background check forms, obscuring the fact that he was under indictment on charges of sexual misconduct in South Carolina when he bought new guns in January and March 2019. One of the guns that be bought that way was found at the scene of an attempted shooting in Pompano Beach, Florida loaded with live rounds and Kodak Blackâ€™s fingerprints on it.</p>
