      <p>Koforidua, Nov.  12, GNA - A consultant on corruption has called on the government to strive to remove the conditions that encourages administrative corruption.</p>
      <p>Ms Clara Kasser of Tee, Consult, a private consulting firm on corruption was speaking at a sensitization workshop on how to prevent and fight corruption at Koforidua.</p>
      <p>The workshop was organized by the Private Enterprise Federation (PEF) for private enterprises in the Eastern Region and sponsored by UK Aid, the European Union and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).</p>
      <p>Ms Kesser said business men and investors would always be pushed to pay a bribe whenever there is a delay in delivering the services they required.</p>
      <p>She explained that to stop the corruption in the public service, the target should be aimed at removing the delays in the rendering of public service.</p>
      <p>Ms Kesser called for the production of service charters by the public service to give a clear information about the services rendered by each agency, the duration that it takes to be served, the responsibility of the customer and the cost involved.</p>
      <p>She said the service charter need to provide a service telephone line for complains by customers who have issues with the service rendered to them and how it would be resolved.</p>
      <p>She said the service charter need to be published and be reviewed periodically to always meet the requirements of the time.</p>
      <p>Ms Kesser suggested that public agencies should be made to retain part of the amount realized from their service charges so that they would not need any financial support from the customers before serving them.</p>
      <p>Earlier in a welcome address, Nana Osei Bonsu, the Chief Executive Officer of PEF explained that the workshop was to share experiences of the participants on administrative corruption.</p>
      <p>He said the exercise was to enable PEF to gather the necessary data to engage policy makers to help remove conditions that promote administrative corruption to help reduce the frustrations that investors face when they need some service from the public sector.</p>
