      <p>COLOMBO: Police stepped up security across Sri Lanka on Wednesday (Nov 13) over fears of violence on the final day of campaigning for the fiercely contested presidential election, officials said.</p>
      <p>Elite police commandos reinforced police as the two frontrunners in Saturday's vote Sajith Premadasa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa held rival rallies in and around Colombo.</p>

      <p>"There are reports of possible violence," a senior police official told AFP. "Additional strength has been deployed in vulnerable areas. Sniffer dogs and explosive detectors will also be used at final rallies."</p>
      <p>Premadasa, 52, is the son of assassinated president Ranasinghe Premadasa who was targeted by a suicide bomber during a May Day rally in Colombo in 1993.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa, brother of former strongman president Mahinda Rajapaksa, narrowly escaped a suicide bomb attack in 2006 blamed on Tamil Tiger separatist rebels.</p>
      <p>While ethnic tensions have eased, this year the country was rocked by coordinated Islamist extremist bombings on Easter Sunday that killed at least 269 people.</p>
      <p>During the election campaign, there were no further such attacks but the independent Election Commission said there were nearly 30 incidents of violence involving members of rival parties.</p>
      <p>Private poll monitor, the People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said it was peaceful compared to the 2015 election when there were more bomb attacks and shootings.</p>
      <p>However, PAFFREL chief Rohana Hettiarachchi told AFP there were more incidents of hate speech, disinformation and intimidation on social media as well as radio and television.</p>
      <p>"We noticed a trend of using social media to issue threats against political opponents," Hettiarachchi said.</p>
      <p>Campaigning should stop at midnight on Wednesday allowing a two-day cooling-off period before Saturday's ballot, with results expected on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Some 16 million people over the age of 18 years are eligible to choose a winner from among a record 35 candidates who include two Buddhist monks and just one woman.</p>
      <p>The European Union on Wednesday despatched 30 additional election observers around the country, joining 50 who have been in Sri Lanka for a month following the campaign.</p>

        <b>RIGHTS RECORD</b>
      </p>
      <p>A possible Gotabhaya Rajapaksa victory has raised concerns abroad about human rights and a renewed pivot of the strategically located nation towards China.</p>
      <p>Mahinda and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa are beloved among the majority Sinhalese community for crushing the Tamil Tigers to end Sri Lanka's 37-year civil war in 2009.</p>
      <p>The final months of the conflict - when Gotabhaya effectively ran the security forces - however allegedly saw some 40,000 Tamil civilians killed.</p>
      <p>He is also accused of - and denies - running a "death squad" that allegedly abducted and murdered not only Tamils but also political opponents and journalists after the war ended.</p>
      <p>According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), in the "dark decade" of Mahinda's rule, at least 14 journalists "were murdered in connection with their work".</p>
      <p>His government also presided over a ballooning of Sri Lanka's debts as it borrowed heavily from China for a string of infrastructure projects, many of which are mired in graft allegations.</p>
      <p>In what for critics is the biggest example of the pitfalls of China's Road Initiative (BRI), in 2017 Sri Lanka gave Beijing a 99-year lease on a port after being unable to service Chinese loans to build it.</p>
      <p>In 2014, two Chinese submarines docked in Colombo, alarming Western countries - as well as India - worried by Beijing's growing regional importance and assertiveness.</p>
      <p>China offered Sri Lanka "international diplomatic protection as well as the funds for development," analyst Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu told AFP.</p>
      <p>The Rajapakas "spent and spent without giving any consideration to how it has to be paid back."</p>
      <p>Basil Rajapaksa, another brother, said on Wednesday that if Gotabhaya wins Sri Lanka "will work with everybody" on securing investment.</p>
      <p>Regarding human rights concerns, Western capitals "should give a fair chance to us," he told reporters. "They can't be monitors of this country, they must be partners."</p>
