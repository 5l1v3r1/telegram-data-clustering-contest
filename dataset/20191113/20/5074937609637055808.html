      <h1>Ghana Deposit Protection Scheme to commence in December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:19:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author">Emmanuel Todd, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov 13, GNA – Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Financial Minister has said the completion of reform exercise within the Banks and specialized deposit-taking institutions (SDIs) in August has paved way for commencement of the "Ghana Deposit Protection Scheme" in December, 2019.</p>
      <p>That, he said, would protect the national budget from costs arising from banking sector failure.</p>
      <p>He said the scheme, supplemented by effective regulation and supervision by the Bank of Ghana, and the work of the Financial Stability Council, would go a long way to make the financial system more resilient and supportive of the efforts to foster inclusive socio-economic growth.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori-Atta said this when he presented the Budget Statement and Economic Policies of Government for 2020 to Parliament on Wednesday in Accra.</p>
      <p>He noted that Banks’ profitability had also been greatly enhanced with a significant pick-up in profit after tax in 2019 compared to the previous year and prior to the reforms, the SDI sector was plagued with acute liquidity and insolvency challenges.</p>
      <p>He said their continued existence posed severe risks to the stability of the financial system and to depositors and as a result, in two separate clean up exercises the licenses of these insolvent institutions were revoked  to curtail a spillover of these weaknesses to other sectors of the financial industry.</p>
      <p>The Minister said these insolvent SDIs comprised of 23 savings and loans and finance house companies, and 347 microfinance companies and Non-Bank Financial Institutions comprising of 39 micro credit companies, one dormant leasing company and one dormant remittance company were also resolved in May and August respectively.</p>
      <p>“This will safeguard the financial system against potential contagion and weaknesses in the SDI sector which threatened to erode the gains made in the banking sector,” he said. </p>
      <p>“Credit risk management practices and loan recovery efforts will be stepped up to minimize overall risks in the banking sector.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori-Atta, therefore, assured that the central bank would continue to pursue policies and strengthen supervision to ensure that the banking sector remains well-capitalised, solvent, liquid and profitable and to also ensure that significant gains recorded in the aftermath of the reforms.</p>
