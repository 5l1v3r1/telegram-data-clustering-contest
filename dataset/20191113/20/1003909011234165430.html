      <h1>Ford: Nothing wrong with prayer, but Alberta must not return to the days of Bible Bill Aberhart</h1>

      <p>Can good people with the best of intentions go horribly wrong? Can they willfully — if unwittingly — promote a retrograde society based on 19th-century morals, attitudes, sexism and racism?</p>
      <p>This is not a historical question. This is happening right here, right now, right under our noses. And it comes with a whiff of righteous piety.</p>
      <p>If I didn’t know it was impossible, I’d presume the organizers are trying to resurrect William Aberhart. The long-time Alberta premier was a Baptist lay preacher and high school principal who was known to all and sundry as Bible Bill. He was very much the tub-thumper turned teacher turned politician, influenced by Major C.H. Douglas and his writings, including Douglas’s theory about a vast “Jewish conspiracy.” Aberhart died in 1943 (although his Social Credit government lasted from 1935 to 1971). The current Alberta government seemingly wants to resurrect the past, with the assistance of the evangelical religious right.</p>
      <p>How else to explain a “Christian” prayer breakfast in Edmonton Nov. 25 with the keynote address given by Pat Nixon, an ordained Baptist minister and founder of the Mustard Seed, the valuable and much-admired ministry for street people and an “address” by Premier Jason Kenney.</p>
      <p>“The aim of the Provincial Prayer Breakfast is to gather like-minded Christians from the Province of Alberta to gather together in prayer,” according to the promotional literature.</p>
      <p>There is nothing wrong with prayer. Or breakfast. Or Christians. But there’s a lot wrong with the totality of the biblical quotation used to promote it and the conflation of all three words which tells those Albertans who are not Christian this is not for them.</p>
      <p>Do we really want a return to the so-called glory days of an almost all-white, all-Christian province (except for the owners of Chinese laundries and restaurants), ruled with one hand on the Bible and one voice on the radio every Sunday morning?</p>
      <p>But everyone is to be made welcome, the promoters will say. Then why not promote a prayer breakfast in Edmonton that marked its 24th anniversary this past April?</p>
      <p>The organizers, MLAs Michaela Glasgo (Brooks-Medicine Hat) and Daniel Williams (Peace River), might point to the national prayer breakfast in Ottawa — no mention of Christians — for support. (Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke at this year’s breakfast quoting Matthew 25: 34-40 which talks about doing good for “one of the least of these my brethren.”)</p>
      <p>This is a touchy subject to tackle for someone who defines herself as an RC (Recovering Catholic). I can be accused on all sides of being an intolerant unbeliever who once received a letter to the editor that began: Dear Godless Bitch. That can’t hurt or offend me. But what does infuriate me is the public way some members of our legislative assembly seemingly want to divide our secular and civil society into us versus them: Christians versus non-Christians. The last time I looked, a goodly portion of our emerging society is not Christian. (To our pan-Canadian credit, the religion of our prime ministers and MPs has rarely figured in any election campaign.)</p>
      <p>Then there’s the Bible. The poster which invites people to buy tickets has as its tag line a quote from Paul’s first epistle to Timothy. Paul’s charge to Timothy in 2:1-2 is to pray, a laudable action: “… first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving thanks be made for all men;</p>
      <p>“For kings and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty.”</p>
      <p>Good goal, but I made the mistake of reading further, having a collection of biblical texts inherited from my grandfather.</p>
      <p>Timothy 2:9 — This, ahem, charming verse exhorts women to dress modestly “with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.”</p>
      <p>Timothy 2:11 — “Let the woman learn in silence, with all subjection.”</p>
      <p>Timothy 2:12 brings home the point: “But suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.”</p>
      <p>In case this isn’t enough to keep us quiet and subservient, consider this epistle blames Eve for being the original transgressor and winds up with an exhortation: “she shall be saved in childbearing.”</p>
      <p>Anyone who chooses to believe the literal truth of the Bible is free to do so, even in 2019. Anyone who chooses to believe in Jesus Christ as a personal Saviour watching over every action (especially during football games) shouldn’t be criticized.</p>
      <p>But all this is personal and intimate. It has no place in the public sphere.</p>
