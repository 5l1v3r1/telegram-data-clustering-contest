      <p>Australian police on Wednesday charged an officer with murder after widespread protests over the fatal shooting of a 19-year-old <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/aborigines.html">Aboriginal</a> man in front of his family.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred on Saturday when police said they attempted to arrest Kumanjayi Walker for "alleged property and assault police offences" in the remote town of Yuendumu.</p>
      <p>According to the force's account, an altercation occurred and an officer who was stabbed in the shoulder "discharged his firearm".</p>
      <p>Walker later died at a police station, where his family alleged he was denied adequate medical treatment.</p>
      <p>"A 28-year old male Northern Territory police officer has been charged with one count of murder," police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Walker was the second Aboriginal person to die in police custody in as many months.</p>
      <p>His death prompted rallies across <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/australia.html">Australia</a> after family members and activists called for a "National Day of Action" on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"We want justice for what they done, being shot in cold blood in front of the mother and wife," said Valerie Napaljarri Martin, a senior member of the same Warlpiri community as Walker.</p>
      <p>"Our black lives matter," she said before the demonstrations. "It's gone beyond too far."</p>
