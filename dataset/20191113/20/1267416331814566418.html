      <h1>Google Stadia app is now available for iOS</h1>
      <h2>You still won't be able to play Stadia games on your iPhone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:08:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>The Google Stadia app is now available on the iPhone, but not for what you think.</p>
      <p>At launch, you won’t be able to play Stadia games on the iPhone, as Google’s upcoming video game streaming platform is limited to the Pixel 2, 3, 3a, and 4.</p>
      <p>However, the iOS version of the app will let you manage your Stadia game library. You’ll also be able to cast Stadia from your iPhone to a Chromecast sharing the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
      <p>We expect Stadia to function on other devices, in the future, but we’re not sure if those will include either the iPhone or the iPad.</p>
      <p>Once users receive their Stadia invite, after purchasing <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/23/google-clarifies-stadia-founders-premiere-edition-shipping-dates/">a Founder’s or Premiere Edition kit</a>, they’ll be able to use the code to unlock the Stadia app for iPhone.</p>
      <p>The Stadia app also appeared on the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/07/google-stadia-play-store/">Play Store recently</a>. Stadia launches on November 19th in Canada, U.S., U.K. and other regions.</p>
