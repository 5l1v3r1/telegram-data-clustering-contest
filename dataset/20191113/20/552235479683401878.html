      <p>The manufacturer has warned that the mistake might not be immediately obvious because both products are wrapped in similar foil.</p>
      <p>Any customer who has bought the product and has a nut allergy is advised not to eat it, and to return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund, or to contact the Mondelez consumer care line on 0800 818181. </p>
