      <p>HALIFAX -- A non-profit organization is mounting a $500,000 funding campaign to help plant trees in municipalities across Atlantic Canada that suffered damage from post-tropical storm Dorian in September.</p>
      <p>Tree Canada, a national charity,<a href="https://treecanada.ca/news-releases/tree-canada-announces-tree-planting-support-for-those-affected-by-hurricane-dorian/"> announced the campaign known as #OperationReLeaf</a>, today in Halifax.</p>
      <p>CEO Danielle St-Aubin says once the money is raised, homeowners, private landowners, and institutions who want to plant a tree can apply for grants to help purchase them.</p>
      <p>St-Aubin stresses the storm damage is still being assessed, and the campaign funding target is an early estimate.</p>
      <p>The first funding operation by the organization was launched following 1996 floods in Saguenay, Que.</p>
      <p>Since then, Tree Canada says it has helped plant more than 82 million trees across the country.</p>
      <p>"We're raising the money now to be able to help them (Atlantic Canada) later on in the year, probably starting next spring or summer," St-Aubin said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>She said Tree Canada helps to fill a gap, as most municipalities are busy dealing with tree damage on municipal property.</p>
      <p>"They're swamped ... so what we do is really help private landowners with their needs by giving them these grants."</p>
      <p>St-Aubin said her organization works with municipalities to plant the tree species they want, ensuring that the "right tree is in the right place."</p>
      <p>Other campaigns have seen trees planted following the 2016 wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alta., and last year's tornadoes in the Ottawa area.</p>
