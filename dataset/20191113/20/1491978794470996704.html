        <i><b>Thursday</b>: No letup for exhausted communities as fires continue to flare in NSW and Queensland. Plus, murder charge over Yuendumu shooting.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 14 November.</p>
      <h3>Top stories</h3>
      <p><b>There has been no letup for some exhausted communities across eastern Australia as bushfires continue to flare.</b> In NSW 61 blazes were still burning on Thursday morning, while more than 70 fires were burning in Queensland ahead of predicted worsening conditions this weekend. The Rumba Dump fire had already burned through more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/how-long-is-your-luck-going-to-last-bushfire-assault-leaves-nsw-towns-shaken">27,000 hectares by Wednesday afternoon</a>, and remained out of control in a number of places including Killabakh, about 20km north of Taree. In Queensland, where at least 14 homes were destroyed, heavy winds caused havoc through most of Wednesday, whipping fire fronts through thousands of hectares of dry bushland. All told, the hundreds of bushfires across NSW have ripped through more than 1 million hectares. “We were here until 2am, maybe 2.30am this morning,” a Killabakh resident, Ian Wheeler, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. “That whole mountain across from us was glowing, literally glowing. I have never seen anything like it.”</p>
      <p><b>A Northern Territory police officer has been charged with murder over last weekend’s shooting of a 19-year-old Indigenous man, Kumanjayi Walker. </b>Walker died after he was shot at Yuendumu, 300km from Alice Springs, on Saturday when two police officers went there to arrest him for breaches of his suspended sentence. A 28–year old male NT police officer has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/yuendumu-shooting-nt-policeman-charged-with-over-death-of-indigenous-man">charged with one count of murder</a>. The announcement came after hundreds of people took to the streets in Sydney, Melbourne and other cities to protest against the shooting.</p>
      <p><b>Donald Trump cared more about investigating his political rival Joe Biden than the fate of Ukraine</b>, according to dramatic testimony from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-impeachment-inquiry-public-hearings-democrats-republicans">first public impeachment inquiry hearing</a>. As Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair, gavelled the House intelligence committee into session, cameras from every major network carried the proceedings to millions of Americans. Republicans<b> </b>used their questioning time to add credibility to the baseless conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/impeachment-inquiry-guide-key-interrogators">Republican counsel</a> also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/12/trump-impeachment-witnesses-guide-gordon-sondland-bill-taylor-marie-yovanovitch">pressed witnesses</a> on Hunter Biden’s qualifications to join the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma. When asked by reporters about the hearing, Trump said, “It’s a witch hunt, it’s a hoax. I’m too busy to watch it. I have not been briefed.”</p>

      <p><b>Jim Casey has been fighting fires his entire professional life.</b> “I’ve watched fire behaviour change in recent years – and the science tells us that it’s climate change that’s driving the conditions fuelling catastrophic fires,” the firefighter and former Greens candidate writes. “For those of us who do this day in, day out, the stress can be hard to manage. That can only be more true for those who fight fires part-time or as volunteers. Longer, hotter fire seasons mean that there is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/australias-firefighters-need-concrete-support-not-just-the-pms-thoughts-and-prayers">more demand than ever on volunteer and paid firefighters</a>, while at the same time resources to support them have been cut.”</p>
      <p><b>The latest wages growth figures released on Wednesday by the bureau of statics show that growth has </b><b>slowed</b>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/nov/14/the-coalitions-wages-projections-are-beyond-a-joke-and-theres-bad-news-all-round">writes Greg Jericho</a>, “with the worst results since the middle of last year. The results confirm that, for yet another year, the government will be forced to revise down its overly optimistic predictions.”</p>
      <p><b>If this was a poll on which Australian bird is featured most frequently on homewares, superb fairy-wrens would win by a mile</b>,<b> </b>writes Holly Parsons. “Teacups, plates, tea towels and cushions across the country are adorned with their image. The combination of their tiny size (they weigh about the same as a 20c piece), pointing up tail and the way they cuddle together makes them pretty darn adorable. I’m going to argue though that there are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/why-im-voting-no-1-superb-fairy-wren-and-you-should-too">many more reasons</a> that you should vote for them in 2019 than simply ‘they look cute’.”</p>

      <p>Cuba’s strange dual system means that public sector workers and those in private enterprise are paid in different currencies. Laura, a GP, earns Cuban pesos, whereas Rogelio, who was a doctor, now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2019/nov/13/its-not-fair-why-havanas-taxi-drivers-outearn-doctors-video">makes more in an hour as a taxi driver</a> than he used to in a month because he is paid in “convertible pesos”, which are worth 24 times more. As doctors and teachers struggle to buy basic goods, is it time for change?</p>

      <p>“The regulator in charge of dealing with complaints about doctors in NSW declined to investigate allegations of <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/watchdog-failed-to-investigate-eight-rpa-surgery-deaths/news-story/762b0d0bcb58326789c0fb7b0b93fd5e">eight preventable ­patient deaths</a>,” the <b>Australian</b> reveals.

The <b>Courier-Mail </b>reports that Queensland firefighters battling to save properties on the frontlines “are being forced to use bushfire maps from the Western Australian government, claiming the state’s own maps are woefully inadequate.”</p>
