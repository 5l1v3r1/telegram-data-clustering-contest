      <p>Malaysia Airlines said on Wednesday it had barred veteran Cambodian opposition figure Sam Rainsy from a flight from Kuala Lumpur to the Indonesian capital Jakarta on the instruction of Indonesian authorities.</p>
      <p>Rainsy later said on Twitter he missed his flight and would try to get another Malaysia Airlines flight to Jakarta on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Rainsy, who lives in self-imposed exile in France, has been in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a> since the weekend after initially saying he planned to return home on Saturday to rally opposition to Cambodian authoritarian ruler Hun Sen.</p>
      <p>"Malaysia Airlines denied boarding of the said passenger under the instruction of the Indonesian authorities," Malaysia Airlines said in a statement in response to a question as to whether Rainsy had been stopped from boarding.</p>
      <p>Asked about the Malaysia Airlines statement, Sam Fernando, the Indonesian Immigration Directorate General spokesperson, said "from the immigration's side, there has not been a request to deny his entry here".</p>
      <p>Denny Abdi, director of the Southeast Asia division of the Indonesian foreign ministry said: "We are not aware of him coming to Jakarta."</p>
      <p>Rainsy had said he planned to return to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/cambodia.html">Cambodia</a> on Saturday, Independence Day, in what Prime Minister Hun Sen characterised as an attempted coup against his rule of more than three decades.</p>
      <p>But Rainsy was blocked in Paris from boarding a Thai Airways flight to Bangkok last Thursday. He then flew to Malaysia, saying he wanted to rally support for the Cambodian opposition in the region.</p>
