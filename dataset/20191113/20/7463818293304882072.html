Binance DEX is now supported so trading on-the-go is possible and convenient. Phone owners are given their private keys so only they can have access to the system and other digital assets.</p>

      <p>The <b>HTC EXODUS 1 Binance Edition</b> is priced at $599 (SGD$889). Early buyers can receive USD $100 in BNB. HTC’s Phil Chen has this to say:<i>“Binance is one of those fearless companies that challenge traditional financial systems and how things are done.”</i></p>
      <p>Ched added: <i>“Their vision of borderless finance is a cause that EXODUS also aspires to. We are excited to be supporting the Binance Chain and its DEX, which provides our community with the biggest spread and most liquid crypto exchange along with the trust minimization principle of empowering users to own their private keys and manage their personal bitcoin node comprehensively.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>We believe this combination and our partnership will usher in a completely new paradigm of digital asset exchanges and corresponding interactions.”</i>
