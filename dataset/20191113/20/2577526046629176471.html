      <h1>Rockstar Pledges to Fix Red Dead 2's Stuttering Issues on PC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:33:24+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author">Riley MacLeod</a></address>
      <p><i>Red Dead Redemption 2’s</i> PC launch was <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/05/red-dead-redemption-2-is-having-a-rough-launch-on-pc">plagued with technical issues</a> when the game released last week. Developer Rockstar has been chipping away at them, and it announced today that it will be releasing a patch that will hopefully address the game’s stutter.</p>
      <p>Many <i>Red Dead</i> PC players, myself included, struggled with an issue where the game would occasionally stutter for a few seconds. Fixes like switching from Vulkan to DX12 resolved the issue for some players, though not nearly all of them. Since launch, Rockstar has released a few patches, largely aimed at problems with the Rockstar Launcher.</p>
      <p>In a tweet today, Rockstar wrote that the stuttering may be due to “unforeseen issues related to specific combinations of Nvidia graphics drivers, Nvidia GPU cards, and certain CPU’s.”</p>

      <p>“We will be rolling out an update to the game today which will address the stuttering issue alongside a host of other fixes,” the statement continued. “However, we are still currently working together with Nvidia to completely resolve the stuttering issue in a future update, and it may take us up to a few days to properly test everything and ensure the next update completely solves the problem.”</p>
      <p>As an apology for the issues PC players have been having, Rockstar will give anyone who plays the game on PC “this week and through to the holiday season” a free “care package for <i>Red Dead Online</i> that includes the Prieto poncho and an assortment of provisions and ammo” to be detailed later.</p>
      <p>I haven’t had a chance to get back to <i>Red Dead</i> on PC since launch, but it’s good to see Rockstar tackling the stuttering issue head-on. Hopefully the game’s performance will continue to improve.</p>
