      <h1>Republicans complained they can't question 'guy who started it all.' Democrat says Trump is 'welcome' to testify.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:58:12+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Brendan Morrow</a></address>
      <p>Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) would both love to question the person who "started" the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Welch just has someone different in mind.</p>
      <p>During the first public impeachment hearing Wednesday, Jordan complained that the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's Ukraine phone call led to the House's official inquiry won't testify before Congress.</p>
      <p>Republicans including President Trump have been <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/468805-trump-demands-testimony-from-whistleblower">demanding this testimony</a>, but House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has said the whistleblower "has a right under laws championed by this committee to remain anonymous and to be protected from harm" and that this testimony would be "redundant and unnecessary," <i><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/10/20958051/trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-republican-request-whistleblower-testimony">Vox </a></i><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/10/20958051/trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-republican-request-whistleblower-testimony">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>"There is one witness that they won't bring in front of us, they won't bring in front of the American people," Jordan said Wednesday. "That's the guy who started it all: the whistleblower."</p>
      <p>In response to Jordan's demand, Welch voiced similar enthusiasm for getting such a person to testify, but he wasn't thinking of the whistleblower.</p>
      <p>"I'd be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify," Welch said. "President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there."</p>
