      <h2>The Uruguayan forward is desperate to play in his fourth World Cup in 2022 and admits he would not be surprised if the club try to replace him in the next few years</h2>

      <p>Luis Suarez said it would 'not be strange' if Barcelona wanted to bring in a new number nine in the near future as he appeared to cast doubt over his long-term future at the club.</p>
      <p>Suarez is the club's fourth all-time top goalscorer and has played a huge part in Barcelona's recent success, winning four La Liga titles and one Champions League during his time at the Nou Camp.</p>
      <p>However, at 32 years old Suarez is arguably reaching the twilight of his career, and he admitted to Uruguayan outlet <a href="https://www.ovaciondigital.com.uy/">Ovacion</a> that he may struggle to deal with the pressure of playing at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the future.</p>

      <p>"The demands at Barcelona are immense," he said. "Every three days you have to have a test, there is no rest, and you are not forgiven if you have even just one bad game.</p>
      <p>"It is not easy to play at a club like Barcelona, to adapt and win your place. I have to respect that I have spent five years at the club dealing with this pressure and always trying to respond in the right manner."</p>
      <p>Suarez has scored six goals in ten games in La Liga so far this season, but he accepts his time at the club may soon be drawing to an end.</p>
      <p>"If the club are looking for, or wish to bring in another number nine, it would not be strange, it is the reality of football," he added.</p>

      <p>"A time will arrive when my age will not allow me to play at the level Barcelona require, but while I can, and while I have the strength to compete, I will."</p>
      <p>Suarez is eyeing a fourth World Cup for his country in Qatar in 2022, by which time he will be 35.</p>
      <p>When asked about his participation in the competition, he said: "I hope so. Actually, I am convinced I will be there."</p>
