      <p>Mayo County Council has welcomed launch of the draft National Marine Planning Framework by Minister Eoghan Murphy and Minister of State Damian English.</p>
      <p>The framework document sets out the forward planning component of the new Marine Planning system.</p>
      <p>Peter Hynes, chief executive of Mayo County Council, who attended today's launch, said: “This document is a very crucial step in developing a thriving sustainable blue economy, particularly for the west of Ireland.</p>
      <p>“Mayo’s strategic position along the Atlantic Coast, in addition to having the longest coastline should ensure that Mayo benefits from this initiative. I look forward to seeing the potential of a blue economy being realised in Mayo”.</p>
      <p>The cathaoirleach of Mayo County Council, Councillor Brendan Mulroy, also welcomed this initiative by government, stating: “Mayo has always had a rich marine heritage and this framework will be key to enhancing that heritage for generations to come”.</p>
      <p>There will be a consultation day in Westport in the Town Hall Theatre on Tuesday, November 26, from 2 to 4 p.m. and from 6 to 8 p.m. for those who wish to comment or find out more about the draft framework.</p>
