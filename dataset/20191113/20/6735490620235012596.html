      <h1>‘Simpsons’ Episode Featuring Michael Jackson Not Available On Disney+</h1>

      <p>For fans of “The Simpsons”, the big selling point about the new Disney+ streaming service is the availability of every single episode of the iconic animated comedy.</p>
      <p>Actually, make that nearly every episode, with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-episode-featuring-michael-jackson-kept-disney-1254609"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> revealing that the “Simpsons” library in Disney’s just-launched service doesn’t include the 1991 episode “Stark Raving Dad”, once seen as a classic but since considered controversial due to its guest star: Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>According to <i>THR</i>, Disney hadn’t responded to “to multiple requests for comment as to why the episode is missing and who made the call,” but it can be assumed it has to do with the horrific allegations of child molestation made about the late King of Pop in the HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland”. </p>

      <p>Following the controversy that erupted after the documentary’s broadcast earlier this year, “Stark Raving Dad” was pulled from television syndication.“It feels clearly the only choice to make,” “Simpsons” executive producer James L. Brooks told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/simpsons-episode-featuring-michael-jacksons-voice-to-be-pulled-11552007802"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a> of the decision to pull the episode. “I’m against book-burning of any kind. But this is our book, and we’re allowed to take out a chapter.”The late star’s estate continues to deny all allegations made in “Leaving Neverland”.</p>
