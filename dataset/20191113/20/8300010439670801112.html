      <p>HACKENSACK, N.J. -- One of hip-hop's pioneers has been released from jail in New Jersey after spending two weeks behind bars on a 17-year-old warrant.<br/><br/>Eric B., whose real name is Eric Barrier, was arrested last month on a warrant stemming from an incident in 2001.<br/><br/>The rapper turned actor was part of the legendary duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim.<br/><br/>He came to court Tuesday wearing a prison jump suit but left the Bergen County Jail in street clothes after paying an old fine of over $5,000.<br/><br/>Eric B. hit the rap scene in the late 1980s with songs that are considered classics in the hip-hop world.<br/><br/>But in 2001, he was driving a brand new Range Rover through Ridgefield Park when he was stopped by police for not having the proper license plate.<br/><br/>From there, the situation escalated into driving on a sidewalk, a police crash, and an officer being injured.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the case in 2002, Barrier was told to pay the $5,000 fine. But he said his lawyer back then told him he didn't have to appear in court because he was being put in a special program called pre-trial intervention.<br/><br/>But Barrier's failure to show led to a bench warrant that did not resurface until he was returning from Canada recently.<br/><br/>He tried to resolve the issue through a lawyer but was then put in jail on Oct. 28 on the old bench warrant.<br/><br/>His current lawyer was successful in geting him out, but he has to return to court.<br/><br/>"He's looking forward to a career in acting and I think he's doing great, he really is," said Barrier's attorney Patrick Toscano. "He's a good, good guy. He's a good human being. He's not what the prosecutor portrayed him to be today in court, that's for sure."<br/><br/>Barrier's first lawyer was highly regarded in the legal community at one point but is now serving six life sentences in federal prison for charges including murder.<br/><br/>Barrier, 56, will return to court Nov. 22 to resolve the old case from the original incident in Ridgefield Park.</p>
