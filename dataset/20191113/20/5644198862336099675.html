      <p>Wall Street's main indexes turned slightly higher on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank saw a "sustained expansion" ahead for the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>NEW YORK: The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 hit record highs on Wednesday helped by a big jump in Walt Disney shares, but the Nasdaq fell and gains were kept in check by fresh uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 92.1 points, or 0.33per cent, to 27,783.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.13 points, or 0.07per cent, to 3,093.97 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.99 points, or 0.05per cent, to 8,482.10.</p>
