      <p>Billie Eilish rocketed to stardom this year, although she's been putting in work for a while. The singer's readying to follow 2019 with a massive year planned in 2020 including an arena tour but until then, she's back with some new music. Eilish released her new single, "everything i wanted" earlier today which marks her first official release since dropping <i>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</i></p>
      <p>"This song is one my brother and I wrote about each other.” Eilish said about the song in a press statement, “No matter what happens, we always have been and will be there to make it better.”</p>
      <p>The song arrives days after promising two new songs. Clearly, she's kept her word but when will we receive the next song? Hopefully soon.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>I had a dream <br/>I got everything I wanted<br/>When I wake up, I see<br/>You with me</p>
