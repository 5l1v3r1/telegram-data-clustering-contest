      <h1>Army recruiters honored after California mall shooting for life-saving actions</h1>

      <p>Two <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/us-army">Army</a> recruiters were recognized last week for providing life-saving aid to two teenagers wounded during a shootout at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/san-francisco">San Francisco</a>-area <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail">mall</a> over the summer.</p>
      <p>Staff Sgt. Isaiah Locklear, 28, and Staff Sgt. Michael Marl, 34, received the Soldier's Medal -- the Army's highest non-combat award -- for “heroism not involving conflict with an enemy" for their actions on July 2, the San Francisco Chronicle <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/2-San-Bruno-mall-shooting-heroes-get-Army-s-14821591.php?fbclid=IwAR1lY9zi-dniTkTw_DzYCRFB0NQehVsAkw5l5sUxh9f2dH8yvzAIQwYPWdI">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The staff sergeants said they were talking with a potential recruit in their offices at The Shops at Tanforan in San Bruno when they heard gunfire. A dispute between two groups of youths sparked the shooting.</p>

      <p>“That’s when we heard two or three shots,” Marl told the <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/11/13/recruiters-receive-soldiers-medals-for-actions-during-california-mall-shooting/">Army Times</a> in July. “We kind of looked at each other and were like, ‘Is this gunfire?’"</p>
      <p>The two men instructed a recruit to go hide in the back while they ran to assist two injured victims.</p>

      <p>Locklear, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y., used his shirt to apply pressure to a 16-year-old's stomach gunshot wound and helped carry another boy to a stretcher.</p>
      <p>“That kid really needed help,” Locklear told the Chronicle. “He kept saying to me, ‘Please don’t let me die.'"</p>
      <p>Marl attended to another teen who was wounded on the thigh.</p>
      <p>“I just applied pressure, kept the kid calm and made sure the friend he had there with him didn’t go running around until the cops showed up,” said Marl, a native of Sitka, Alaska, who served deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Thankfully, one of the first cops that came up actually had a tourniquet."</p>
