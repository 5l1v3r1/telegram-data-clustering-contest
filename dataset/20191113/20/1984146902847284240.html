      <h1>How every North East beach ranks for water quality</h1>
      <h2>For the second year running, 33 of the region's 34 designated bathing waters have achieved either ‘excellent' or ‘good' ratings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Herbert Soden</a></address>
      <p>More North East bathing waters than ever before have been rated ‘excellent' in the latest classifications announced today by Defra.</p>
      <p>For the second year running, 33 of the region's 34 designated bathing waters have achieved either ‘excellent' or ‘good' ratings, with the number achieving the highest categorisation rising from 24 to 25.</p>
      <p>A further eight are ‘good', while work continues at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cullercoats">Cullercoats</a>, to identify and remedy the causes of it being rated ‘poor', the only bathing water not to pass the standards.</p>
      <p>If water is classified as poor, then a sign advising against bathing will be displayed. However, the beach remains open for people to enjoy.</p>
      <p>Bathing water quality is rated out of three stars, with three being 'excellent', two being 'good', one star being 'sufficient' and no stars meaning 'poor' bathing water quality.</p>
