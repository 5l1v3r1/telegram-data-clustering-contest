      <p>A man accused of a "shocking and depraved" <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/husbands-friends-raped-laughed-shot-20861603">rape</a> and kidnapping spree told police: "If you had caught me for the first two, the rest of this wouldn't have happened," <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">a court heard</a> .</p>
      <p>Joseph McCann is charged with 37 counts, including eight of rape, against 11 victims including an 11-year-old boy and a 71-year-old woman.</p>
      <p>Over 15 days between April 20 and May 5, the 34-year-old travelled between London, Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Through his rampage he kidnapped one young woman - repeatedly raping her while he held her prisoner in his car for over 14 hours.</p>
      <p>At the Old Bailey, a jury also heard he then snatched another young woman from the street near her home and keep the two in his car before they finally escaped after smashing a vodka bottle over his head.</p>
      <p>It is alleged McCann, from Harrow in north London, then travelled north where he held a family of three prisoner, tying a mother to a bed while he sexually assaulted her young son and teen daughter in the next room.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the family only escaped when the daughter, a 17-year-old girl, jumped from a window naked and ran to a neighbour's house to call the police.</p>

      <p>Later that day he forced a pensioner to drive him around as he snatched children from the street, it is alleged.</p>
      <p>When one victim escaped, he would find another within hours.</p>
      <p>On the final day of his spree he is accused of stopping at a petrol station to buy condoms with two teenage girls held hostage in her car.</p>
      <p>But McCann's terrifying spree soon came to an end, the jury heard. After passing a marked police car on a roundabout the defendant was said to have crashed the car into a Mercedes before he ran away - leaving the two teenage girls behind.</p>
      <p>They were "shocked, very frightened, and distressed. But mercifully unharmed," said Mr Price QC.</p>
      <p>McCann was then said to have taken a mountain bike to escape.</p>

      <p>The bike was later found outside a restaurant in Scholar Green, south of Stoke-on-Trent where staff told police a man came into to ask to borrow a phone.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the man, said to be McCann was overheard ordering a taxi which arrived shortly afterwards to take him away.</p>
      <p>Mr Price QC said: "The police had put up roadblocks. PC David Reed was manning one on the A34 just to the south of Congleton.</p>
      <p>"At 20.40pm he caused a taxi to stop. By that time the police had the name and a very good description of the man they were searching for.</p>

      <p>"They also knew he had a distinctive tattoo on his stomach. Looking into the back of the taxi PC Reed suspected the passenger was the man they were looking for.</p>
      <p>"The man had a pint glass in his hand and stated to the officer he had been drinking in pubs with his mates all day long and was on his way home. Asked if he had a tattoo on his tummy, he said, 'No, you're not fucking seeing.'"</p>
      <p>He fled from the taxi and police pursued him into a field where he was later found in a tree. After a several hour stand-off he was arrested.</p>
      <p>He was then transported to London by officers.</p>
      <p>Today, prosecutor John Price QC told the jury: "Though he refused to be interviewed after he arrived in London, Joseph McCann did say something of relevance to an officer involved in accompanying him on that journey.</p>
      <p>"This was perhaps a little closer to the truth. He told DC Foxwell, 'If you had caught me for the first two, the rest of this wouldn't have happened,'."</p>
