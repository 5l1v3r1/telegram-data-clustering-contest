      <h1>WATCH- Death toll rises to six as Israel pound civilian targets in Gaza, Israeli soldiers attack CNN crew in dramatic video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T03:06:18+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 03:06</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>Israeli forces have pounded civilian targets in Gaza hours after it killed Islamic Jihad leader Baha Abu al-Ata in a targeted assassination. At least six Palestinians are reported to have died in latest Israeli atrocities. The murder of al-Ata by Israeli forces evoked a flurry of rocket attacks by Palestinians with one rocket narrowly missing a series of cars. In other developments, Isareli forces, known for their brutalities, also stopped a CNN news crew from reporting on their atrocities. The video of CNN correspondent Oren Liebermann being pushed and stopped by brutal Israeli military personnel from reporting on the violence has gone viral on social media platforms.</p>

      <p>In the video, Liebermann is heard saying during the live broadcast, “An IDF(Israeli Defence Forces) soldier is putting his hand on the camera. An IDF soldier and his officer putting their hands on our camera as we try and broadcast on today’s developments from..The officer is now telling both his soldiers that he’s not okay. The soldiers are now using violence against us even though the officer has told them we are meant to be here for the live.”</p>

      <p>Fresh attacks on Palestinian civilians by Israel come after several rockets were fired from Gaza to what appeared to be a revenge attack of the murder of al-Ata by Israeli military.</p>
      <p>Gaza’s health ministry said that about 30 Palestinians were wounded by the Israeli attacks.</p>
      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that while Israel was not seeking escalation, it was prepared for a protracted period of fighting. He told reporters, “Whoever thinks that they can hit our citizens and evade our long arm is wrong.</p>
      <p>“We’ve proven that we can hit, surgically, wherever the terrorists hide. Whoever harms us, we will harm them.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, activists have taken to social media to post the videos of what they claimed were evidence of the latest Israeli atrocities against Palestinians.</p>

      <p>Human rights body Amnesty International said that the reports of Israeli forces massacring Palestinian civilians were ‘deeply worrying.’ It also condemned the attack on the offices of Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights. “Reports that five Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes today are deeply worrying. The ensuing escalation in violence between Israel and Palestinian armed groups raises fears of a rise in civilian bloodshed. We are closely monitoring the situation.</p>
      <p>“We strongly condemn attack on the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights whose office in Gaza was struck by an Israeli missile earlier this morning. Strikes targeting civilian buildings is a violation of international law. We are sending our solidarity to<br/>@ICHR_Pal.”</p>
