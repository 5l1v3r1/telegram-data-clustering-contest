      <h1>Joe Gomez scratch 'caused by Raheem Sterling's jewellery' in England canteen bust-up</h1>
      <h2>FA reported to be considering Sterling misconduct charge after he was axed from England qualifier following row with Gomez</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T03:25:33+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 03:25</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>The scratch sported by Joe Gomez following his England bust-up with Raheem Sterling was reportedly caused by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> man's jewellery.</p>
      <p>The fallout from Monday's row continued on Tuesday when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Gomez turned up for England training <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/joe-gomez-left-scratch-below-20865689">with a scratch under his right eye</a>.</p>
      <p>The day before, Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate had axed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Sterling</a> from England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>That came after Sterling reignited a row with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-gomez">Gomez</a> which had started on the pitch in the closing stages of Liverpool's 3-1 win over City at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>When England players reported for training at St George's park on Monday, Gomez is believed to have approached Sterling in the squad canteen.</p>

      <p>Sterling said to Gomez "So you think you're the big man?" before reportedly trying to get the Liverpool defender in a headlock.</p>
      <p>After Gomez turned up to training the following day with a scar under his eye, Southgate was asked at a press conference whether Sterling had caused the scratch.</p>
      <p>The England manager would not divulge any details, but it appears the scratch was caused by jewellery Sterling was wearing, according to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10333935/england-sterling-gomez-what-happened-fight/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573598141">Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>The two players reportedly had to be pulled apart by team-mates, sending food flying from tables.</p>

      <p>The FA are reported to be considering hitting Sterling with a misconduct charge.</p>
      <p>Sterling later apologised to Gomez and the rest of the England players at a squad meeting, and has stayed with them amid the possibility of returning to action in Sunday's qualifier against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Gomez had reportedly asked Southgate not to banish Sterling from the squad.</p>
      <p>After the shameful incident, Sterling posted on social media to admit that emotions had got the better of him.</p>

      <p>Defending Premier League champions City are now nine points behind Liverpool following their defeat to the leaders on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sterling said via <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> : "We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions got the better of me.</p>
      <p>“Both Joe and I have had words, figured things out and moved on.</p>
      <p>“Me and Joe are good, we both understand it was a 5-10 second thing. It’s done, we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.</p>
      <p>“Let’s get focus on our game on Thursday.”</p>
