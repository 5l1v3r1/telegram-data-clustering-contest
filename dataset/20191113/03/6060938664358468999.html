      <p>MUMBAI: After winning the World Championship title in August this year, PV Sindhu hasn't really been able to make it to the business end of major tournaments. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/saina-nehwal">Saina Nehwal</a> too hasn't been in a rich vein of form after winning the Indonesia Masters.</p>
      <p>Last week, Sindhu went down in a three-game match against Pai Yu Po of Taiwan, while Saina lost in straight games to China's Cai Yan - both in the first round at the China Open Super 750 tournament.</p>
      <p>National <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pullela-Gopichand">Pullela Gopichand</a> isn't too worried though, despite the 2020 Tokyo Olympics soon approaching.</p>
      <p>"For the last six years, Sindhu has been the most consistent in the biggest events of the year. There's nobody who's gone year after year to the World Championships and won a bronze, then won silver and then gold," Gopichand said at a promotional event in the city on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"It's not that she's been a 'flash in the pan' kind of a player. She's good, she's strong, she's our best bet going into the big tournaments. This is what happened last year as well. She did not have a great result in October and November but then in December at the year-ender, she beat everybody. So I'm confident that she'll make a comeback quickly."</p>
      <p>The former All-England champion chose not to dwell on the poor form of India's star women's duo, but was rather focused on the bigger challenge - the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>"The players are forced to play tournaments after tournament. I've said it many times that it's unfortunate but it's something we have to do and the rules are the same for everyone," he said. "What we need to do is get our Olympic quotas as soon as possible. We need to secure our places before February so that we can start preparing as early as possible. Any player from India who makes it to the Olympics has a chance of winning it."</p>
      <p>Gopichand has been very vocal about the lack of coaches in the country and reiterated his stance.</p>
      <p>"At the moment, coaching as a profession is not so exciting and that's something that needs to fundamentally change. As a country, we may not be able to build great infrastructure overnight but great infrastructure has not produced great players. Great coaches have always produced great players," he said.</p>
