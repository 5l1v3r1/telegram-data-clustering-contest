      <p>PRESENTATION is key when selling, but you need to focus on more than just how the home looks according to one eastern states agency: smell was also important.</p>
      <p>Research published in Brain Sciences Magazine revealed our sense of smell played a huge part in how we felt and that this sense, above all others, was most closely linked to the emotion-processing areas of the brain.</p>
      <p>Upside chief executive Adam Rigby said getting the right scent was becoming an increasingly important tool at open-house inspections.</p>
      <p>The company has launched a fragrance guide for selling in the coast, city and the country.</p>
      <p>“We want potential buyers to feel relaxed as they walk around your home,” Mr Rigby said.</p>
      <p>“The right fragrance can evoke really positive memories and improve mood which is vital when it comes to making that sale, but, there’s a real art to this.</p>
      <p>“It’s about being subtle; long gone are the days of baking bread or putting on a pot of coffee, buyers can see through that.”</p>
      <p>Mr Rigby said US agency Long and Foster had just launched its own signature fragrance for its clients, working with a French fragrance house to create the scent.</p>
      <p>“In the UK we’re seeing personalised scents being created for high end house sales by some of the very best perfumiers,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So, we are fully expecting to see a much bigger focus on the use of scent in the Australian housing market in the next six to 12-months.”</p>
      <p>According to Upside, the three most popular style homes are coastal, city or country residences.</p>
      <p>Here are its tips for creating a subtle lift in your home:</p>
      <p>– Coastal homes: It’s all about creating an invigorating environment. Think rosemary, lemon verbena, bergamot or peppermint which has been proven to improve memory, and critically help your buyers remember more details of your home.</p>
      <p>– City homes: For inner-city it’s all about creating warmth and maturity. Think cedarwood, or aged vetiver which have sharp and earthy tones. Don’t be afraid to use different scents in different rooms, to create a change in mood. How about creating a newly laundered smell in your bedroom.</p>
      <p>– Country home: As the temperatures begin to rise, it’s all about making the inside a place to retreat. Diffusers can be very strong, especially if they are left in small rooms or bathrooms but if you have an airy space – a hallway would be perfect.</p>
      <p>Mr Rigby said having a clean home was essential but he said strong household cleaners could have a strong and off-putting smell.</p>
      <p>“Make sure to do the main cleaning around 24 hours before any inspection, and just do a last minute tidy up before people arrive,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also said to not overdo any fragrance.</p>
      <p>“You want to welcome people to your home, not overpower them,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If you are using a scented candle or oil burner turn it off a good 30 minutes before the inspection starts; don’t forget to crack open some windows.”</p>
