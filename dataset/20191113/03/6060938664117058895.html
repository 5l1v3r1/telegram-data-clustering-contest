      <p>NEW DELHI: It was on November 13, 2014, when opening batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a>, popularly known as the 'Hitman', registered the highest individual ODI score.</p>
      <p>Rohit went on to score 264 runs against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sri-Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> in Kolkata, and till date the knock remains the highest score by any batsman in 50-over internationals.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was given a reprieve when he was on just four and went on to make the most of it as he scored 260 more runs to make the Sri Lankan bowlers toil on the field.</p>
      <p>"#OnThisDay in 2014, Rohit Sharma went big! The Indian opener smashed 264, the highest ever ODI score. The worst part? Sri Lanka dropped him when he was on 4," ICC tweeted.</p>

      <p>It was the fourth ODI of the five-match series against Sri Lanka, in which Rohit decided to show the world his big-hitting skills. His 264 included 33 fours and nine sixes and helped India put up a total of 404/5.</p>
      <p>Rohit was dismissed on the final ball of the innings by Nuwan Kulasekara. India then bundled out Sri Lanka for 251 runs, registering a win by 153 runs.</p>
      <p>An ODI double century has been scored just eight times in ODIs, and Rohit has done it twice. He scored 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014 and made 208 runs against Australia in 2017.</p>
      <p>Sachin Tendulkar was the first batsman to register a double century in the ODIs, scoring it against South Africa in 2010.</p>
      <p>Last week, Rohit, standing in as the skipper in the absence of Virat Kohli, led India to a 2-1 T20I series win over Bangladesh. He went on to play a knock of 85 runs in the second match of the series to guide the hosts to an emphatic eight-wicket win.</p>
      <p>India will next face Bangladesh in the two-match Test series, slated to begin from November 14.</p>
