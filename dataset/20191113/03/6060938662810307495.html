      <p>HONG KONG: World Champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pv-sindhu">PV Sindhu</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/HS-Prannoy">HS Prannoy</a> made a positive start to their campaign but Saina Nehwal and Sameer Verma were ousted from the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hong-Kong-Open">Hong Kong Open</a> after suffering contrasting defeats in the opening round of the USD 400,000 event here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sixth seed Sindhu, who had faltered in the opening round in a couple of recent tournaments, took 36 minutes to see off world No. 19 Kim Ga Eun of Korea 21-15 21-16 to progress to the second round.</p>
      <p>The Olympic silver medallist will face Thailand's Busanan Ongbamrungphan next.</p>
      <p>However, eighth seed Saina, who claimed the Indonesia Masters in January this year, suffered her fifth first-round loss in the last six tournaments, going down 13-21, 20-22 to China's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cai-Yan-Yan">Cai Yan Yan</a> for the second successive time. She had lost to Cai at China Open last week.</p>
      <p>World No. 16 Sameer fought for 54 minutes before going to Wang Tzu Wei of Chinese Taipei 11-21, 21-13, 8-21 in the opening match. It was his third successive loss in the opening round.</p>
      <p>Saina and Sameer are both scheduled to play Gwangju Korea Masters Super 300 tournament next week.</p>
      <p>World No. 6 Sindhu moved to a 8-4 lead early on but Kim managed to turn the tables, holding an 11-10 advantage at the breather. The Indian then reeled off six points at 13-13 to march ahead and seal the opening game.</p>
      <p>The second game was no different as Sindhu again broke off at 5-5, grabbing seven points on the trot to move to a massive 12-5 lead. The Indian kept moving ahead and eventually shut the door comfortably on her opponent.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Saina lacked the wherewithal to put up a fight against Cai in the opening game and fell behind from the very start. She couldn't catch up with the Chinese, who moved to a comfortable 11-4 lead at the break and kept surging ahead to win the first game.</p>
      <p>In the second game, Saina was 3-0 up initially but Cai reeled off seven straight points at 2-4 to jump to a 9-4 advantage. The Indian narrowed the gap but Cai was ahead 11-9 at the breather.</p>
      <p>After the interval, the Chinese jumped to a 17-11 advantage. However, Saina managed to fight back and grab a game point at 20-19 but the Chinese once again managed to nose ahead.</p>
      <p>Sameer, on the other hand, managed to take one game away from the World No. 26 Wang after meekly surrendering the opening game.</p>
      <p>Wang was 7-4 up and then surged to 15-5 in a jiffy to eventually close the opening game.</p>
      <p>In the second game, Wang led 3-0 early on but this time Sameer put up a fierce fight to open up a slender 11-10 lead, which he capitalised to roar back into the contest.</p>
      <p>However, Sameer was completely blown away by Wang in the decider. The Taiwanese shuttler zoomed to an 8-0 lead and then grabbed a 15-2 advantage, a gap which the Indian failed to bridge in the end.</p>
      <p>Prannoy defeated China's Huang Yu Xiang in straight games 21-17, 21-17 in his first-round match.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old had the upper hand in the match as he did not allow his opponent to build any momentum in the 44-minute long encounter.</p>
