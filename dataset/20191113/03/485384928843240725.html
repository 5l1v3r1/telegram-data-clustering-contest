      <p>Australians think women are more likely than men to need intelligence and good looks to get ahead, a study has found.</p>
      <p>The market research company Ipsos and King's College London surveyed about 20,000 people in 28 countries about their perception of what was needed to succeed — whether it was intelligence, working hard, having good connections, or just being hot.</p>
      <p>In Australia, 12 per cent said looks were a key factor in helping women get ahead, while only 5 per cent said the same for men.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five per cent said intelligence was one of the most important factors helping women get ahead, compared with 15 per cent who said the same for men.</p>
      <p>Ipsos Australia Director of Public Affairs Jessica Elgood told <i>Hack</i> the survey found a significant difference in the attributes women need to have to make progress.</p>
      <p>"We also asked what were the most important factors in stopping women from achieving equality with men in each country," she said.</p>
      <p>"In Australia, we have 16 per cent mentioning the lack of education for men and boys [in relation to gender equality], and then men also not necessarily helping women achieve equality.</p>
      <aside>I think there's something there around the Australian culture and the Aussie bloke still being a relatively macho thing.</aside>
      <p>"And maybe something there in the messages we're sending to our boys and younger men in terms of actually what their role is in gender equality."</p>

      <p>Question: Which two or three of the following, if any, do you think have been the most important factors that help MEN get ahead in Australia?</p>

      <h3>How does Australia compare with other countries?</h3>
      <p>In Australia, Britain and the US, a similar proportion of people named looks as a key factor in women getting ahead, while in Brazil, India and Spain the public tended to think it was less important.</p>
      <p>In Russia, by comparison, the public rated looks very highly.</p>
      <p>Thirty-six per cent of people surveyed said it was a key factor in women's success, while only five per cent said the same for men.</p>

      <p>Since this is based on a survey, the figure could be read two ways — either looks really are more important for women to succeed in Russia, or the Russians were just more clear-eyed about what's important than Australians were.</p>
      <p>"I don't think the Russians are necessarily more clear-eyed there. I think there are some genuine differences, I'm happy to say," Jess said.</p>
      <p>"There are some stereotypes that come through in the data. Places like Germany really focused on your qualifications, which maybe isn't surprising.</p>
      <p>"But it doesn't necessarily play out all the stereotypes. Latin American countries talk about the need to be qualified, which you wouldn't necessarily assume."</p>
      <p>Australians generally blamed employers for not addressing the gender pay gap, or promoting women to senior positions.</p>
      <h3>What other factors were associated with getting ahead?</h3>
      <p>For both men and women in Australia, the factor most people associated with getting ahead was working hard, followed by confidence and being qualified.</p>
      <p>Looks was eighth on the list for women, below 'never giving up' and 'is connected', and above 'having a good sense of humour'.</p>
      <p>Here's the full list, compared to Britain and the US:</p>

      <p>Supplied: Ipsos</p>
      <p>This is the first time Ipsos has run this survey, which means we can't compare it with previous studies and identify a trend — whether looks have become more or less important for helping women to succeed in Australia.</p>
      <p>"I think we will update it in the future," Jess said.</p>
