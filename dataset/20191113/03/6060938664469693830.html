      <p>NAGPUR: The second day of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hong-Kong-Open">Hong Kong Open</a> BWF World Tour Super 500 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> tournament turned out to be a mixed bag for the Indian shuttlers. While five singles players including <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pv-sindhu">PV Sindhu</a> entered the second round, another first round defeat of Saina Nehwal puts a serious question mark on her future.</p>
      <p>Qualifier Sourabh Verma continued his sparkling show to join <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/HS-Prannoy">HS Prannoy</a>, Parupalli Kashyap and Kidambi Srikanth in the last 16. But it was curtains for B Sai Praneeth and Sameer Verma. Both lost in three tough games.</p>
      <p>In a shocking result, the in-form men’s doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty squandered away a bright start and went down fighting against Takuro Hoki and Yugo Kobayashi of Japan 21-17, 16-21, 17-21. The world No. 7 Indian duo of Satwik and Chirag were surprised by world No. 14 Japanese pair in a marathon match which lasted for an hour and two minutes.</p>
      <p>Overcoming her first round exit in the China Open last week, Sindhu carved out a clinical 21-15, 21-16 win against Kim Ga Eun. Sixth seed Sindhu needed just 36 minutes to get past world No. 19 Korean in their first ever meeting.</p>
      <p>Sindhu began well and established a four-point cushion but Kim bounced back to take a slender 11-10 lead at the break. The tall Indian then reeled off six successive points to clinch the first game.</p>
      <p>In the second game too, Sindhu was in control most of the time. A seven-point burst at the start helped her down her opponent.</p>
      <p>The world champion will now take on Busanan Ongbamrungphan of Thailand, ranked 18th in the world for a spot in the last eight on Thursday. Sindhu has a perfect 10-0 head-to-head record against the Thai girl.</p>
      <p>World No. 9 Saina came up with a far better fight than their last meeting in the China Open but goes down in straight games against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cai-Yan-Yan">Cai Yan Yan</a>, world No. 22, in the first round.</p>
      <p>In the men’s singles, Kashyap kept his 2020 Olympic Games chances alive by registering a brilliant win over world No. 12 Kenta Nishimoto. World No. 25 Kashyap knocked out Japanese 21-18, 16-21, 21-10 in their first meeting on the circuit.</p>
      <p>Prannoy ousts China’s Huang Yu Xiang in straight games for his first win after returning from dengue. The former national champion will next face 6th seed Jonatan Christie of Indonesia.</p>
      <p>In an all-India second round encounter, Srikanth will lock horns with Sourabh Verma, who shocked Frenchman Brice Leverdez 21-11, 21-15.</p>
