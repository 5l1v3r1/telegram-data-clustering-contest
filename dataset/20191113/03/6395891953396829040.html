      <p><b>PHILADELPHIA (AP)</b> - The shots weren't falling for the Philadelphia 76ers, so they clamped down on defense.</p>
      <p>Joel Embiid scored 27 points, including the go-ahead dunk with 13.2 seconds remaining, and Philadelphia held Cleveland without a point for the final 3 ½ minutes in a 98-97 win over the Cavaliers on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Josh Richardson added 17 points and Ben Simmons had 15 for Philadelphia, which won despite missing 30 of 38 3-point attempts. Tobias Harris missed all 11 of his 3-point tries.</p>
      <p>"You better guard if you're not going to make shots," 76ers coach Brett Brown said. "We knew if we were going to do anything, we had to play defense - and defense we played."</p>
      <p>Jordan Clarkson and Kevin Love each had 20 points to pace Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 18 points and Tristan Thompson had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers.</p>
      <p>The Cavaliers trailed for most of the contest, but took advantage of Philadelphia's poor shooting in the fourth quarter, going up by as many as five points on three occasions.</p>
      <p>"We gave them life and were in a fistfight," Brown said. "You can just feel it. We had a chance to discourage them and we didn't. Certainly a hard-fought game and we're lucky to get away with it."</p>
      <p>Cleveland led 97-92 with 3:34 remaining after Sexton's driving layup, but the Cavaliers wouldn't score again. Harris pulled Philadelphia within 97-94 with a follow layup and then hit a 17-footer on the ensuing possession to make it a one-point game with 1:42 left.</p>
      <p>Cleveland had chances to build the lead after that, but Love missed a close-range shot before a shot-clock violation on the Cavaliers' next possession.</p>
      <p>"I think our defense was pretty OK," Embiid said. "We just didn't make shots."</p>
      <p>The 76ers were having their own trouble scoring with Richardson and Embiid failing to convert on consecutive possessions.</p>
      <p>After a timeout with 26.6 seconds left, Brown called a high-percentage play with Harris finding Embiid close to the basket. Embiid slammed it home to give the 76ers their first lead, 98-97, since early in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>"It was a great play-call by coach and we did the rest," Embiid said.</p>
      <p>Cleveland had a chance to win it, but Love's 3-point attempt from the top of the key rimmed out.</p>
      <p>"Kevin is a great shooter, not a good shooter," Cleveland coach John Beilein said. "He took his time but just didn't nail it. It's one of many looks I'll take at that time."</p>
      <p>CLOSE CALLS</p>
      <p>Four of Philadelphia's seven wins have been by eight points or less. Asked if the 76ers were playing with fire by winning such close games, Brown said, "It's a blow torch. It is violent."</p>
      <p>"I, sadistically, love it," he added.</p>
      <p>BEN'S BACK</p>
      <p>Simmons returned after missing two games due to a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder. He added six assists, five rebounds and two blocks to his point total, but also had four turnovers in 35 minutes. He made 7 of 9 field goals with all but a 6-foot turnaround jumper from close range.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Cavaliers: Kevin Porter Jr. returned in the second half after appearing to injure his hip early in the second quarter. Porter finished with four points. . John Henson (hamstring) and Ante Zizic (foot) sat out.</p>
      <p>76ers: Al Horford (rest), Shake Milton (knee) and Trey Burke (left calf) didn't play. . Philadelphia missed its first eight 3-pointers before Embiid connected from long range with 1:49 left in the first quarter. The 76ers finished the first period 1 for 11 from the arc, with Harris missing all five of his 3-point attempts. . The 76ers finished the first half going 3 for 20 from 3-point range, but led 54-48.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Cavaliers: Host Miami on Thursday.</p>
      <p>76ers: At Orlando on Wednesday.</p>
