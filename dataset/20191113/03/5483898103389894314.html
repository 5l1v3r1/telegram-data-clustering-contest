      <h3>Six-month “on demand” public transport trials will begin in the Barossa and Mount Barker early in 2020.</h3>
      <p>Transport Minister Stephan Knoll has told the Barossa Herald:</p>
      <blockquote>"We are exploring 'on-demand' bus services, so passengers don't have to wait for a bus service in these areas, they can call one when they need it.<br/><br/>"'On-demand' services will provide passengers with a faster and more personalised service.<br/><br/>"Passengers will be able to track where their bus is and order it to their location to save them waiting in the rain or heat.<br/><br/>"In its simplest terms, these 'on-demand' bus services will operate in a similar way to most ride sharing apps than millions of people use right across the country.</blockquote>
