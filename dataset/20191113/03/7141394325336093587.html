      <p>The overall crypto market is a mixed bag today, with BTC, ETH and XRP in the red. Here’s a bird’s-eye view from COIN360 at time of publishing.</p>

      <p>Crypto analyst Scott Melker of Texas West Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1194271945241636866">says</a> he’s just entered a ‘heavy’ position on Bitcoin after spotting a bullish divergence.</p>
      <p>A bullish divergence happens when an asset hits a lower low while an indicator such as the RSI or MACD forms a higher low. Melker stresses the high volatility involved in crypto trading and says he’s managing his risk.</p>

      <p>Jim Wyckoff, a former technical analyst for Dow Jones Newswires, has a different take.</p>
      <p>He says the bears appear to have taken over for now. He <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-11-12/Bitcoin-daily-chart-alert-Bears-gain-technical-advantage-Nov-12.html">expects</a> BTC to keep moving sideways or trend lower in the short term.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Prices are trending lower from the October high and the bears have gained the near-term technical advantage, to suggest sideways-to-lower price action in the near term. Stay tuned.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>As for Ethereum, Josh Olszewicz of Brave New Coin says ETH may be targeting a rise to $260 this month.</p>
      <p>But in order to do so, it will have to rise above resistance at around $190.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Eric Choe, who won CME Group’s annual trading competition in 2016, says he remains bullish on XRP, despite its drop-off in 2019.</p>
      <p>Back in June, Choe <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/06/17/all-in-on-xrp-cme-trading-competition-winner-says-hes-betting-on-early-retirement/">said</a> he placed a big bet on XRP in order to shoot for an early retirement.</p>
      <p>Since that investment, the price of XRP has dropped from about $0.4049 to its current price of $0.2719.</p>
