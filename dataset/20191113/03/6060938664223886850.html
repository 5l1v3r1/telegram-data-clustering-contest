      <p>INDORE: A few months after he was adjudged to be conflicted by BCCI ombudsman, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> finds himself stuck on the same wicket. However, he is likely to emerge 'not out' on this occasion.</p>
      <p>The former India captain is again being questioned in some quarters on the conflict-of-interest issue after he tweeted on My11circle, a fantasy cricket league which gives a chance to its users to win a reward for predicting the best playing eleven for a match.</p>
      <p>His critics point out that a BCCI president promoting such a venture is unprecedented. They also allege that this is a case of ambush marketing since Dream11 is an official IPL partner and Ganguly tweeted about a rival company.</p>
      <p>"You're bringing this issue to my knowledge for the first time. For the first time, you've a Board president who's a celebrity too. You can't compare his case to other presidents. After quitting cricket, he's been endorsing brands and earning his livelihood. We can't deprive him of that," BCCI treasurer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arun-Thakur">Arun Thakur</a> told TOI.</p>
      <p>When told about Ganguly endorsing a rival product of the Board sponsor, Thakur said: "We'll have to see what commitment he made when signing that contract. You don't sign contracts in the anticipation that you'll become the BCCI president one day."</p>
      <p>Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCI's former Game development manager, says that "ambush marketing' rules apply to the players, and not the officials," as per the Board constitution..</p>
      <p>"Nike was the Indian team's sponsor for several years, and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sachin-Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> had a contract with Adidas. There was no conflict, because he had to disclose in the contract that he has a deal with Adidas."</p>
      <p>On Monday, in Mumbai, Ganguly said he didn't see any conflict in his deal.</p>
