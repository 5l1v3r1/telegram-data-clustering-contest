      <p>CHENNAI: When India missed the chance of direct Olympic qualification losing to Malaysia in the Asian Games, there were a few raised eyebrows and coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harendra-Singh">Harendra Singh</a> was sacked immediately.</p>
      <p>Fourteen months down the line India have regrouped well under new coach Graham Reid and have sealed their spot in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tokyo-Olympics">Tokyo Olympics</a>, beating Russia in the qualifiers earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The national team has done well in the last few months and now they will look to make an impact in the Pro-League, where the team will be up against the world's best sides.</p>
      <p>"We were never worried about Olympic qualification. It was a missed opportunity at the Asian Games but that didn't dent our confidence. You can't win all the games and there will be the odd disappointment. It hurts a lot but it's more important to bounce back and give your best in the next game," current India goalkeeper PR <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sreejesh">Sreejesh</a>, who was in Chennai to attend a coaching camp organised by the Hockey Unit of Tamil Nadu, said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He felt that India have a balanced side going forward. "Holding onto the No.5 position for such a long time is not that easy. The boys are aware of the fact that we haven't won any Olympic medal in the last 40 years and they know how important it is to bring back the glory. It's not easy but if we can focus more on consistency, I am confident that we will do well in Tokyo," Sreejesh added.</p>
      <p>Rupinder Pal Singh, who made his return to the national team after some time, felt playing together for years makes the difference. Teams like Argentina and Belgium are ruling the world because most of the players in the core group have been playing with each other for more than 10 years. India too have a similar system is place now and will reap the benefit very soon, the ace drag-flicker said.</p>
      <p>"Everything depends on how strong your grass-root programme is. Most of the world champion teams have very organised junior programme and that's how they continuously produce players for the senior team. We too have a good system in place and its' doing great. The current side is a good mix of experienced and young players and I am pretty confident that our team will do very well in the Olympics," Rupinderpal, who has been playing for Chennai-based Indian Overseas Bank for many years, said.</p>
      <p>Sreejesh feels Pro-League, which started last year, will offer a great platform to players (especially the juniors) to test their mettle against some of the biggest teams, and it will also help the team understand if the preparation for the Olympics in on the right track.</p>
      <p>"India will have 22-25 games before the Olympics and I think more matches we win, morale of the boys will be higher before the Tokyo show. Pro-league will be a great platform and I am sure all the players will utilise the opportunity and give their best against world's best sides," he added.</p>
