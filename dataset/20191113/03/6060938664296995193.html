      <p>It is that time of the year again when merely breathing the highly polluted air can cause respiratory conditions including coughing, sore throat and even breathlessness. Sadly, our lungs bear the maximum brunt of the pollutants as the quality of air hits a new low with every passing day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Time to stop complaining and take matters in your hand</b>
      </p>
      <p>When your respiratory health starts taking the beating because of the particulates present in the air, it is strongly advisable to take care of your health. Instead of waiting for the government and authorities to come around and do their job, we need to stop whining and do the best we can to battle air pollution.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The foolproof plan to battle air pollution</b>
      </p>
      <p>We spoke to nutritionist Kavita Devgan who gave us a plan to tackle the dreaded air pollution head-on. She also listed down certain lifestyle changes and food items which can keep your body fit and fight the side-effects of particulates present in the air.</p>
      <p>According to her, you should absolutely include food items like apples, oranges, bananas, pineapple, mint and oregano in your diet to strengthen your immunity, unclog your arteries and airway and breathe better. She also suggests exercising, staying away from smoke and shunning junk food completely.</p>
      <p>Talking about the junk and processed food items and why you need to avoid them, she said, “Junk the junk. There is already an onslaught happening on your immunity. Please do not eat any more junk. Instead, I suggest trying to have 2-3 fruits every day. There are enough studies to show that for our respiratory health, 3 fruits a day can really give you rich dividends.”</p>
      <p>Emphasising on the importance of vitamin C intake, Kavita further said, “Try and have a lot of Vitamin C. You have to actively prevent inflammation happening in your lungs and Vitamin C is almost like a godsend for you. Try and have amla, oranges, they are in season. Focus on Vitamin C rich fruits and vegetables every day.”</p>
      <p>She also suggested some helpful lifestyle tweaks to ensure that your health does not bear the brunt of growing air pollution. Since allergic symptoms like sneezing, mucus formation and cold and cough are really common, one should eat food items which are natural antihistamines.</p>
      <p>Moreover, make sure your morning cup of tea has a lot of ginger in it. Have one cup early in the morning and second after you come back home in the evening. Ginger has compounds that make sure the pollutants get expelled from the body.</p>
      <p>Lastly, every time you step out, take a clove and put it under your tongue. It is going to make sure that phlegm does not accumulate in your throat and oesophagus.</p>
