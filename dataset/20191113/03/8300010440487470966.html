      <p>TARZANA, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Eyewitness News has learned that two suspects have been taken into custody in connection with a series of home robberies involving so-called pop-up dispensaries which may be linked to a <a href="https://abc7.com/3-suspects-sought-after-fatal-shooting-of-man-outside-tarzana-home/5559451/">homicide in Tarzana</a>.<br/><br/>Jean Carlos De La Rosa, 24, was fatally shot on Sept. 21 outside a home on Sugargman Street that was used as an Airbnb, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Officers said the man was sitting in a car with a friend when three men arrived and demanded their belongings. The victim was shot several times before the suspect fled. Investigators believe the incident was a "follow-home" armed robbery.<br/><br/>At the time, police were hoping that surveillance footage would help them locate the three suspects who were outstanding. The footage showed what they believe is the suspect's car speeding away from the scene.<br/><br/>Allen Asengua, 24, and Michael Agboola, 28, are now facing chargers of murder and robbery, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. Asengua is being held with no bail while bail for Agboola has been set at $1.15 million.<br/><br/>There was a person inside the residence, but it wasn't clear if that person was involved or was a guest, police said.<br/><br/>The following statement was issued by Airbnb following the shooting: <i>"Our community's safety, both online and offline, is our priority. We are deeply saddened by this senseless act of violence, and we're in touch with the victim's family to offer our support and condolences."</i></p>
