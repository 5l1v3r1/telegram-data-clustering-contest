      <h1>Video: Tyson Fury’s dad challenges Dana White to a fight: ‘Keep my son’s name out of your mouth’</h1>

      <p>Big John Fury, father of heavyweight boxing star Tyson Fury, is not happy with Dana White’s recent comments about his son.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.lowkickmma.com/dana-white-questions-tyson-furys-mma-ambitions/">TMZ Sports </a>in a recent interview, the UFC president dismissed Fury’s chances in MMA and advised the multiple-title heavyweight champ to stick to boxing.</p>
      <p>“Tyson Fury had a tough time in his last fight in a boxing match. Coming over to MMA is a whole ‘nother story,” White said of Fury’s chances in the UFC. “… Listen, anything’s possible. If Tyson Fury wants to fight in MMA, I’ve got a ton of guys that would love to fight him.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t know why. I can’t wrap my head around why. …He’s an incredible fighter. Promoted the right way, [he] could be a part of three or four of the biggest fights in heavyweight [boxing] history.”</p>
      <p>“Why come over here and get smashed when you could stay there? Tyson Fury, your time is now. You’re the man in boxing. You’re one of the top four guys in the world in boxing. Why even think of coming over here?</p>
      <p>John Fury, a former boxer with a professional record of 8-4 (1 draw), responded by challenging White, a former boxercise instructor, to a fight.</p>
      <p>“How does he know about smashing anybody when Tyson comes from a smashing family, you know what I’m saying?” John Fury told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLLXBinvvIM">iFL TV</a>, <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/tyson-furys-father-challenges-dana-white-to-a-fight-keep-my-sons-name-out-of-your-mouth/">per BJPenn.com</a>. “When I can probably smash Dana White with one punch, you know what I’m saying? So how can he write my son off like that? You can’t write a man off with Tyson’s ability or heart or will to win, and he knows that. He’s talking stupid.”</p>

      <p>“Let him talk to me like that. I’ll fight him,” Fury added. “Match me up with him tonight, you know what I’m saying? Because I believe I’m the best 54-year-old man in the world. I’m the fittest, I know that, and I’m the best 54-year-old man on the planet. I’m going to prove it anytime, anywhere, for free or for money. So let him take that in your pipe and smoke it. I mean that, mate. Keep my son’s name out of your mouth. If it’s not good, don’t talk about him.”</p>
      <p>Tyson Fury recently headed to Liverpool, England to train with top-five UFC middleweight Darren Till, where the undefeated boxer hit the pads and learned how to sprawl.</p>
