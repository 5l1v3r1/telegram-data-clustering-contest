      <h1>Disney+ Accidentally Cropped Out A Bunch Of ‘The Simpsons’ Jokes, And Fans Are Peeved</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T03:30:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Richards</a></address>
      <p>While Disney+ launches <a href="https://junkee.com/disney-streaming-content/227522">in Australia next week</a>, yesterday it made its highly anticipated debut in the US. Given Disney’s <i>Katamari Damacy</i> acquisition of near-every media company, it boasts a whole lot of decidedly un-Disney titles, including all 30+ seasons of <i>The Simpsons</i>.</p>
      <p>Excited die-hard fans have noticed that the a majority of the seasons’ ratio aspect has changed — essentially cropping many of those small background jokes that colour the show. And they’re not happy about it.</p>

      <p>When <i>The Simpsons</i> debuted in 1989, it was in a 4:3 ratio, which remained in place until the show got an HD and 16:9 upgrade halfway through Season 20 in 2009.</p>
      <p>In short, that means the first 20 seasons (aka all <a href="https://junkee.com/longform/simpsons-best-episodes">the golden era</a>, plus 11-9 more seasons, depending on your mileage) have been stretched out on Disney+ in a choice to release the series in an uniform ratio.</p>
      <p>College Humour writer Tristan Cooper was one of the first to point out the difference, tweeting out an example where a visual gag about the three types of Duff Beer all come from the same tube.</p>

      <p>While this feels like a small gripe, it’s an odd choice considering the work that would go into transmuting the ratio: Disney+ have essentially done more work to make something less good. Brent Black tweeted out a helpful graphic, if you’re struggling to see the issue.</p>

      <p>It’s not just super fans who are upset, with <i>The </i><i>Simpsons</i> writer and golden era show-runner Bill Oakley <a href="https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/1194300215877988352">tweeting out</a> his own disapproval.</p>
      <p><i>The Simpsons</i> is far from alone in the ratio swap, as most older animated shows <a href="https://twitter.com/Nitomatta/status/1194309038625804288">appear to be affected too and updated to 16:9</a>., though they aren’t regarded as one of television’s best and most influential comedies.</p>
      <p>In addition to cropping out The Simpsons’ visual gags, the whole series feels “claustrophobic” and “unwatchable” according to <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_sheridan/status/1194155161725198337">some users</a>, as we’re now much closer to characters’ faces, which have also been stretched in the process.</p>

      <p>The ratio fuss is a particular sore spot for <i>Simpsons</i> aficionados, as they encountered the same issue when FX launched streaming option<i> Simpsons World</i> in 2013, later reinstating a 4:3 option for the affected seasons after criticism. Disney+ has not learnt from FX’s mistake, and has pissed off a lot of fans in the process — especially since they had previously told multiple sources that the 4:3 ratio would remain. Disney+ representatives declined to comment on whether a 4:3 ratio will become available in time (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961067/simpsons-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-43-169-streaming-fxx"><i>Verge</i></a>).</p>
      <p>As for Australians, there’s good and bad news. when Disney+ launches November 19, we won’t have to worry about a shitty aspect ratio, because <i>The Simpsons</i> will remain off the platform while Foxtel retain the show’s local streaming rights.</p>
      <p>It’s almost a better fit, in a way: this way we don’t have Bart Simpson’s penis or jokes about Disney being an evil corporation on a Disney platform, which also feels like Werner Herzog <a href="https://twitter.com/PatchNavillus/status/1194258881381310464">doing a Disney film</a>.</p>
