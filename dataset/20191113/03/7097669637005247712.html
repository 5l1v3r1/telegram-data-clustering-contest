      <p>A meteor lit up the sky over St. Louis, Missouri, on Monday night, CBS affiliate <a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/watch-meteor-lights-up-the-sky-across-st-louis/article_9a7988d0-04fc-11ea-892b-5f73e52e1370.html?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">KMOV-TV reports</a>. Hundreds of residents reported seeing a bright flash of light across at least two counties. Many also reported hearing a loud boom as the meteor streaked across the sky around 9 p.m. local time.</p>
      <p>The sighting coincides with the height of the Northern Taurids meteor shower, which is known for its spectacular fireballs.</p>
      <p>Check this out! At 8:51 pm we heard a loud boom then saw this on our ring video. Anyone else hear or see it?</p>

      <p>The Taurids is produced by debris colliding with the atmosphere as the Earth drifts through remnants from the P1/Encke comet, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/taurid-meteor-shower-2019-time-how-to-catch-the-fireballs-at-their-peak/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">according to CNET</a>. This occurs annually during the last three months of the year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/2019/11/fireball-spotted-over-missouri-on-nov-11th-2019/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">American Meteor Society</a> said most sightings came from Missouri but it also received reports from witnesses in Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. The group calculated based on those reports that the fireball was traveling from east to west and ended its flight somewhere near Wellsville, Missouri.</p>
      <p>A number of home security cameras captured video of the fireball streaking through the sky.</p>

      <p>The National Weather Service could not confirm if the meteor touched down or if it burned up in the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Typically there are none as the the meteor is largely incinerated by the atmosphere. They can however make it to the surface. Unknown at this time if it did or not. If it does make it to the surface, it depends on how large it is and what it hits to gauge impacts.</p>
