      <h1>‘Deep Electrification’ Means More Natural Gas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jude Clemente</a></address>
      <p>For environmental reasons, there’s an ongoing push to “electrify everything,” from cars to port operations to heating. The idea is that a “deep electrification” will help lower greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.</p>
      <p>The reality, however, is that more electrification will surge the need for electricity, an obvious fact that seems to be getting forgotten.</p>
      <p>The majority of this increase occurs in the transportation sector: electric cars can increase home power usage by 50% or more.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/71500.pdf">U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL) says that “electrification has the potential to significantly increase overall demand for electricity.”</p>
      <p>NREL reports that a “high” electrification scenario would up our power demand by around 40% through 2050.</p>
      <p>A high electrification scenario would grow our annual power consumption by 80 terawatt hours per year.</p>
      <p>For comparison, that is like adding a Colorado and Massachusetts of new demand each year.</p>
      <p>The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) confirms that electrification could boom our power demand <a href="http://ipu.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/EPRI-Electrification-Report-2018.pdf">by over 50%</a>.</p>
      <p>Electricity is slated to more than double its share of final energy consumption to around 50% in the decades ahead.</p>
      <p>From load shifting to higher peak demand, deep electrification will present major challenges for us.</p>
      <p>At around 4,050 terawatt hours, U.S. power demand has been flat over the past decade since The Great Recession.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, much higher electricity demand favors all sources of electricity, a “rising tide lifts all boats” sort of thing.</p>
      <p>But in particular, it favors gas because gas supplies almost 40% of U.S. electricity generation, up from 20% a decade ago.</p>
      <p>Gas is cheap, reliable, flexible, and backups intermittent wind and solar.</p>
      <p>In fact, even over the past decade with flat electricity demand, U.S. gas used for electricity has still managed to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3045us2a.htm">balloon 60% to 30 Bcf/d</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38612">At 235,000 MW</a>, the U.S. Department of Energy has gas easily adding the most power capacity in the decades ago.</p>
      <p>Electrification and more electricity needs show how we demand realistic energy policies.</p>
      <p>As the heart of our electric power system, natural gas will surely remain essential.</p>
      <p>Indeed, EPRI models that U.S. gas usage increases under “all” electrification scenarios even if gas prices more than double to $6.00 per MMBtu.</p>
      <p>Some are forgetting that the clear growth sectors for the U.S. gas industry are a triad, in order: LNG exports, electricity, manufacturing.</p>
      <p>The industry obviously knows, for instance, that the residential sector hasn’t seen any gains in gas demand in <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3010us2A.htm">50 years</a>.</p>
