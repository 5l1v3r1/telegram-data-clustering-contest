      <h1>Disney+ Subscribers Are Now Discovering ‘Racist’ Overtones In Old Disney Films</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Mikelle Leow</a></address>
      <p><b>Disney has launched</b> Disney+, its answer to streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu. Subscribers are treated to an entire archive called the Disney Vault that not only includes all-time favorites like <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> and <i>Cinderella</i>, but also features 80 years worth of movies, toons and television shows produced by Walt Disney Co. <br/><b>As it turns out,</b> not every film is as kid-friendly as expected, at least for today’s standards. Some of Disney’s older movies have been discovered to feature “racist” imagery, and the company is fully aware of this. It’s inserted historical notes into programs that are likely to be deemed insensitive and problematic today. <br/><b>Even Walt Disney’s grandniece</b> Abigail Disney <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/walt-disneys-grandniece-agrees-meryl-670039?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">wrote</a> in a 2014 Facebook post that she had “mixed feelings” about her famous relative. “Anti-Semite? Check. Misogynist? OF COURSE!” she described of her granduncle. “Racist? C’mon, he made a film [<i>The Jungle Book</i>] about how you should stay ‘with your own kind’ at the height of the fight over segregation!” <br/><b>However, she admitted</b> that the entertainment mogul “was hella good at making films, and his work has made billions of people happy. There’s no denying it.” <br/><b>If you don’t own</b> a Disney+ subscription yet, simply rewatch classics like <i>Dumbo</i>, <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>, <i>The Jungle Book</i> and <i>Peter Pan</i> to have a grasp of the less politically-correct nuances that had flown over your head as a child. <br/><b>According to <i><a href="https://www.mic.com/p/thanks-to-disney-people-are-noticing-all-of-the-racist-stuff-in-disneys-vault-19343921?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Mic</a></i>,</b> in 1941’s <i>Dumbo</i>, a flock of crows can be seen singing <i>When I See an Elephant Fly</i>; this scene has been interpreted to represent Black minstrelsy. To top things off, the lead singer’s name is Jim Crow. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a></p>

      <p><b>The Siamese cats</b> in <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> mimic the stereotypes of unscrupulous East Asians, while the orangutans in <i>The Jungle Book</i> have been deemed as caricatures of Black Americans. <i>Peter Pan</i> additionally has a track sung by Native Americans called <i>What Makes the Red Man Red?</i>.</p>
