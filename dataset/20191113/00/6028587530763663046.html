      <p>Wizarding World Gold, the official subscription service for fans of J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World, is now live. <i>Harry Potter </i>fans can now preview the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/10/15/wizarding-world-gold-reveals-annual-subscription-perks-for-harry-potter-fans/">perks</a> available with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/10/24/exclusive-how-will-wizarding-world-gold-entice-harry-potter-fans/">Wizarding World Gold</a> membership, which promises exclusive access to events, discounts and new material through the new Wizarding World app.</p>
      <p>Introduced this summer, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/08/16/official-app-based-on-j-k-rowlings-wizarding-world-announced/">Wizarding World app</a> is an interactive experience for fans of J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World, and has been gradually adding more features, from the reimagined augmented reality Hogwarts Sorting Ceremony experience, to polls, quizzes and a personalized Wizarding Passport. It is currently at #163 in the Entertainment charts on the iOS App store, and rated 3 stars across the App Store and Google Play Store.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/10/24/exclusive-how-will-wizarding-world-gold-entice-harry-potter-fans/">Wizarding World Gold</a>, a newly available subscription service from Wizarding World Digital, a partnership between Warner Bros. and Pottermore, gives subscribers (Gold members) access to all-new experiences and more benefits via the Wizarding World app, as well as welcoming gift the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/10/24/exclusive-how-will-wizarding-world-gold-entice-harry-potter-fans/">Keys and Curios Journal</a>. Subscribers also receive all seven <i>Harry Potter</i> e-books, discounts, priority access to tickets, exclusive products, and Wizarding World Originals - a new video series offering a behind-the-scenes look at the talent of the creative teams behind the Wizarding World.</p>
      <p>A teaser for the series shows graphic design duo <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/06/09/designing-j-k-rowlings-wizarding-world-graphic-design-duo-minalima-on-harry-potter-beyond/">MinaLima</a>, who worked on the <i>Harry Potter </i>films, are currently working on the <i>Fantastic Beasts </i>film series, and also designed the cover for the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/10/24/exclusive-how-will-wizarding-world-gold-entice-harry-potter-fans/">Keys and Curios Journal</a>, discussing their work:</p>
      <p>A 12-month Wizarding World Gold subscription costs $74.99 in US and £59.99 in UK and is initially only available in these territories, with more territories promised in future. It’s likely the rate of subscriptions will be determined by the quality of offerings reported by fans already subscribed to the service, as well as the exclusivity of the details on offer and how well these translate into international territories as the subscription service rolls out into other countries in future.</p>
      <p>Exclusive merch (such as pins and products with the newly designed Hogwarts House mascots) might be enough to tempt <i>Harry Potter </i>fans, as well as the promise of exclusive event access, exclusive Wizarding World of Harry Potter packages, and priority booking to future events and shows (i.e. the <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i> play). However, there have been clear concerns expressed upon the announcement of the subscription service about the prospect of Gold membership alienating dedicated fans to the series who can’t afford to subscribe.</p>
      <p>How Wizarding World Digital handles these concerns by keeping the Wizarding World app a valuable free space for fans with the Official Harry Potter Fan Club–and still offering exclusive experiences for Gold members–will likely determine the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmapocock/2019/10/24/exclusive-how-will-wizarding-world-gold-entice-harry-potter-fans/">success and reception </a>of Wizarding World Gold in the coming months.</p>
      <p>The Wizarding World app is now available on iOS and Android. The Wizarding World Gold subscription service is currently launched and available for purchase in the U.S. and U.K..</p>
