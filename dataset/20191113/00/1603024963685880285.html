        <figcaption>After years of being secretive about its records, streaming platform Netflix released viewership data from October 2018 to September 2019. Netflix announced that it counts anyone who’s watched 70 percent of a single episode within four weeks of a series’ premiere as a 'viewer' of that show. This led to some criticism since even if you watch the first episode of a show and then decide not to continue with the rest of the series, you still count as a viewer. Nonetheless, here's a roundup of what the top ten most-viewed series on the platform, according to Netflix. (Image: Netflix.com)</figcaption>
