      <p><i>Accused used to create nuisance in the locality so the victim had complained against him</i> <br/><br/>A 40-year-old man chased and stabbed a 55-year-old man with a broken beer bottle for going to the police against him. The victim, Nagaraju, is said to be in the hospital in a critical condition and an attempt-to-murder case has been registered against Chikkabasavaiah. <br/><br/>Nagaraju, a resident of Kannnamangala on the Yelahanka Road had complained against Chikkabasavaiah, also a resident of the area, for creating nuisance. Chikkabasavaiah allegedly used to roam around in the locality abusing everybody without any rhyme or reason. <br/><br/>On October 18, Nagaraju approached the police and reported the matter. The police had summoned the accused and questioned him. They had warned him not to trouble anybody and to mend his behaviour. Since then, Chikkabasavaiah is said to have been fuming against the victim and had hatched a plot to kill him. “On Friday, when Nagaraju was going towards the farm, the accused followed him and picked up a fight with him for filing a complaint against him. When the victim warned him he would approach the police again, the accused is said to have hit the victim on his head with a beer bottle. He then hit him on the face with the broken bottle. When the victim started running, the accused chased and stabbed him multiple times on the shoulder and other parts of his upper body,” said an officer. <br/><br/>When the victim started screaming for help, passers-by came to his rescue. The accused escaped from the spot but not before telling him that he should consider himself lucky to have survived. He also threatened to kill him. <br/><br/>“Locals informed the victim’s son about the attack. Nagaraju is undergoing treatment at the Victoria Hospital and is said to be recovering. The police have arrested the accused on Sunday and have remanded him to judicial custody,” the officer added. <br/><br/>The Bengaluru Rural Police have registered a case of attempt to murder (IPC 307) and intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace (IPC 504) against the accused.</p>
