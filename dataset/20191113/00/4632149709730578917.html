      <p><b>In defence, US prez to release details of call with Ukraine leader<br/><br/>WASHINGTON</b> US President Donald Trump on Tuesday dangled a new line of defense a day before Congress’ impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine goes public, promising to release details about another call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. <br/><br/>Trump over the weekend said he would likely release the transcript of that conversation on Tuesday, describing it to reporters as “very important,” before saying in a post on Twitter on Monday that he would release it “some time this week.” <br/><br/>Early on Tuesday, he continued to suggest it would be released “before week’s end” but gave no other details. As the first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry were set to begin on Wednesday, the Republican president laid out his defence in a series of tweets early on Tuesday after slamming the probe and the Democrats conducting it in other posts Monday night. <br/><br/><br/>“No Due Process Scam!” he wrote. The investigation, formally launched six weeks ago by Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, has shadowed Trump’s presidency with the threat that he could be removed from office even as he seeks re-election next year. He is the fourth US president to face impeachment. None were removed from office, although Richard Nixon resigned as he faced almost certain impeachment in 1974 over the Watergate scandal. <br/><br/>Democrats are investigating whether there are grounds to impeach Trump over his July 25 request, in a phone call to Zelenskiy, that the latter investigate a domestic political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. hat call prompted a whistleblower complaint that led Democrats to launch the probe in September into whether Trump abused his power by withholding nearly $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine to pressure the vulnerable US ally. The transcript Trump said he would release is from a call with Zelenskiy on April 12, after the Ukrainian was elected president but before he took office. The White House did not release a readout of that conversation when it took place. <br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, congressional Republicans on the House panels conducting the impeachment inquiry, in a memo to party leaders, said weeks of closed-door testimony have not established that Trump committed an impeachable offence.</p>
