      <p>LONDON (AP) - Bernardo Silva will miss Manchester City’s trip to Chelsea after being banned for one game for posting a tweet which compared teammate Benjamin Mendy to the character on a packet of Conguitos chocolates.</p>
      <p>The midfielder admitted to an “aggravated breach” of rules because the post referenced race.</p>
      <p>He was also fined 50,000 pounds ($64,000) and ordered to complete face-to-face education. The Premier League game Silva misses at Chelsea is on Nov. 23, after the international break.</p>
      <p>The FA commission accepted Silva “did not himself intend the post to be insulting or in any way racist” and was a “joke between close friends.”</p>
      <p>But the FA verdict added “that his was not a private jocular communication between two friends. The post was on a social media platform exposed to the 600,000 followers of a high-profile and well-respected professional footballer.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Silva wrote a letter to the FA, expressing regret for any unintentional offense caused by the tweet.</p>
      <p>It shows a picture of Mendy when he was a kid alongside the character found on a packet of Conguitos, which are chocolate-covered nuts made in Spain. Both Mendy and the character are black.</p>
      <p>Mendy, who is close friends with Silva having also played with the Portugal international at French club Monaco, issued a supporting statement with Silva’s letter, saying he did not take offense.</p>
