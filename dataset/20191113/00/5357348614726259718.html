        <b>Dear Editor,</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every night Mona Road is transformed into a cow pasture for a herd of cows.</p>
      <p>As some sections of the road are dimly lit, often these cows seem to just appear out of nowhere.</p>
      <p>This is a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
      <p>These cows need to be removed before there is a serious accident.</p>
      <p>It is a most selfish act on the part of the owner who is putting motorists at risk.</p>
      <p>It is also rather careless for the authorities to allow this to continue for so many years.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
