      <h1>John Legend Is Confused About Being Hailed People Magazine’s ‘Sexiest Man Alive’</h1>

      <p><b>John Legend is</b> the world’s first “EGOTSMA,” now that he has been hailed by <i>People</i> magazine as its 2019 Sexiest Man Alive. <br/><b>An EGOTs-what?</b> The 40-year-old musician is one of only 15 stars to attain an EGOT—with an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony under his belt—and aside from being recognized for his talents, he’s being awarded for his looks. <br/><b>Legend is the 34th</b> man to be named <i>People</i> magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive, and is sheepish about being the successor to last year’s leading man, Idris Elba. <br/><b>The singer told</b> the publication that while he was “excited” about being appointed Sexiest Man Alive, he was “a little scared” about being scrutinized by the public. <br/><b>“Everyone’s going to be</b> picking me apart to see if I’m sexy enough to hold this title,” Legend said. Further, having to be compared with Idris Elba “is not fair and is not nice to me!” <br/><b>On Instagram,</b> the confused singer shared side-by-side shots of a strapping Elba next to a young bespectacled John Legend. <br/><b>“1995 John would be</b> very perplexed to be following 2018 @IdrisElba as #SexiestManAlive,” he wrote. “Hell, 2019 John is about as equally perplexed, but thank you People for finding me sexy. I’ll take it.” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>To celebrate</b> Legend’s status, <i>People</i> magazine featured him on two covers of its 25 November double issue. The first shows him posing in water with an unbuttoned shirt, while the other sees him smirking with a suit on. <br/><b>The magazine also</b> invited Legend to read out some thirsty tweets about him with his liquid gold voice.</p>
