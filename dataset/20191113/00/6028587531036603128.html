      <p>The world of home audio is changing. Ever since the launch of Sonos, the audio market has had to adapt to a trend that’s moving away from traditional hi-fi separates towards all-in-one systems that are convenient and small. Many of us move homes more often than our parents, and we live in smaller spaces, so there’s a growing demand for compact audio systems that offer excellent sound quality but with a small footprint. Consumers also want to be able to play music from a wide variety of sources. This latest trend in the audio industry is already reflected with some innovative all-in-one offerings from makers such as Naim and Ruark’s, but now there’s another name to add to the mix. Kanto is a Canadian speaker manufacturer that’s been marketing its products in North America for the past 12 years. Based in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Kanto has now launched its latest wireless speaker in Europe, hoping to ride the popularity surge for all-in-one audio solutions.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The TUK has possibly the widest range of inputs you’ll see on any wireless speakers on the market. The speakers are named after the hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk in the North-Western Territories of Canada, a sub-arctic area of natural beauty where the aurora borealis can be regularly seen. That paints a nice picture but can these speakers penetrate a market that already includes some very capable performers? </p>
      <p>Designed to be versatile as well as space-saving, TUK uses Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless streaming with support for both aptX HD and AAC high-quality audio codecs, for near-CD quality sound. Additionally, there’s a dedicated phono preamp for connecting up a turntable for playing vinyl records. For other devices, there is are RCA inputs for an analog source, such as an FM tuner or cassette deck, plus an optical TOS-Link digital input that could be used for a CD player or any other digital source such as a TV. A USB DAC has been built-in for linking up a PC or Mac playing digital streaming services like Spotify, Tidal or Qobuz, removing the need to buy (and find space for) a separate DAC.</p>

        <figcaption>These wireless TUK speakers from Kanto feature special Air Motion Transformer (AMT) tweeters which ... [+] are designed for low distortion treble.<cite>Kanto</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The TUK speakers are rated at 130W total RMS and use Air Motion Transformer (AMT) tweeters, a type of driver that can deliver plenty of detail without distortion. The main driver is a light and rigid 5.25-inch aluminum cone delivering the bottom end. The speaker cabinets have a minimalist design and can be ordered in matte black and matte white finishes. With dimensions of 7 x 8.5 x 10.9 inches (17.8 x 21.5 x 27.6 cm), the TUK should fit nicely on a bookshelf or desktop, although Kanto also produces speaker stands designed specifically for TUK. </p>
      <p>One thing I particularly like the sound of is the TUK’s reversible channel feature. This is a feature that all wireless speaker manufacturers should adopt. With active speakers, one speaker – the master speaker – has to be placed near a power outlet in order to provide juice for the built-in amplifier and signal processor. The second speaker is connected to the master via a length of speaker cable and then functions as a slave speaker. If the master channel is on the left channel, and if there’s no power outlet on the left side of the room, there could be a problem. With reversible channels, the user gets to decide if the master speaker functions as the left or right channel, which makes for much more flexible placement.</p>
      <p>A set of custom EQs are built-in for shaping the speakers’ tone to an individual tastes, plus there’s advanced signal detection for switching sources and saving power when there’s no music playing. For those of us who like their bass big and fat, there’s an output for a subwoofer using an active crossover that filters out frequencies below 80Hz and sends them directly to the sub, which should improve resolution and reduce distortion. A headphone socket driven by a headphone amplifier is also provided for private listening.</p>

        <figcaption>Kanto's TUK are small enough to be placed on a desk to be used as computer speakers.<cite>Kanto</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Finally, there’s something called “Night Mode” which dials down the bass levels and bypasses the subwoofer if there’s one connected. This all helps to keep relations nice and friendly with the neighbors, especially for those who live in apartments with thin walls. Many of these features can be accessed using the supplied remote control.</p>
      <p>I’ve yet to hear the TUK speakers but I hope to be able to audition them in the coming weeks. If the speakers sound half as good as they look on paper, the TUK could well be a serious player in the wireless speaker market.</p>
