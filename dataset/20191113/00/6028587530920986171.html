      <p>At least 50 percent of the contents in a woman’s bag will consist of cosmetics. That large makeup kit taking up all your bag space would typically have a pressed powder compact, blush, concealer, eye liner, lipstick and mascara. When transitioning from one season to another or when putting together a cosmetic bag for a trip, the tendency has been to over pack. Three lip shades and two balms? Three bottles of liquid foundation? Five shades of blush? Really?Unless one is a makeup artist by profession, it makes little to no sense to carry all that cosmetic weight around on the daily. It’s a realization we come face to face with once we take a closer look at the things we lug around in our totes all day long. The truth of the matter is that we only really need a few very basic items in our purse. How much time while on-the-go do you truly have for a full retouch? How often does one need to apply concealer in a day? These were questions that I pondered upon as I watched some of the most put together women walk around with the smallest clutch bags and the chicest mini totes this season. How are they so polished without having to carry an entire beauty counter in their bags?</p>
      <p>The answer was simple: cutthroat editing. The key is to choose a few essential items that are effective, efficient and multifunctional. This might mean having to part with the comforting company of four blush tubes day in and out. It may also entail trading in a full eye color palette for that one trusty eye liner. Regardless of the makeup look you may be going for this Fall, here are beauty basics that will help you achieve with ease.</p>

      <p>Winter cold means using skincare and makeup products that melt on skin instead of caking or leaving a scary cast on the surface. <a href="https://www.cremedelamer.com/product/5817/41001/skincolor/the-concealer/face-concealer#/shade/Medium"><b>LA MER THE CONCEALER </b></a>was a very recent discovery that did not disappoint especially when worn in low temperatures. It leaves medium to full coverage so you need not worry about dark circles or skin imperfections. I especially loved how it delivered on the promise of flawless looking skin after a long haul flight that left skin looking tired and dull. Creamy consistency also did not crease and stayed on for hours on end.</p>
