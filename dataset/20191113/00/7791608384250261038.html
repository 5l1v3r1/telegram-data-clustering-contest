      <p><b>Iconic sitcom <i>Friends</i></b> has been celebrating its <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/mediaviewer/rm1687093504?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">25th anniversary</a> throughout the year, but it turns out that the best is yet to come. <i><a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/406765/How-The-Friends-Logo-Design-Became-The-One-With-All-The-Love/">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> reveals that the hit series might return for a special reunion show with its creators and main cast. <br/><b>This means that</b> fans can see their beloved cast member—Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer—together once again on their television screens as creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman join forces for the comeback show. <br/><b>However, the publication</b> claims that everything is still pretty hush-hush as everyone’s schedules will need to be taken in consideration first. <br/><b>Though the massive return</b> is allegedly in talks of being aired by <i>HBO Max</i>, fans have been enjoying the series decades later on Netflix. It will soon come to an end, though, as WarnerMedia-backed <i>HBO Max</i> will claim streaming rights to the show from Netflix after 2019. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Aniston, who plays</b> one of the lead character int he show, previously turned down a <i>Friends</i> reboot, but told host Ellen DeGeneres that the gang would love to do something together. She then gave hopes to fans by affirming, “We’re working on something.” <br/><b>Since then, Aniston</b> has taken the internet by storm by <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/406833/Jennifer-Aniston-Holds-Record-For-One-Million-Instagram-Followers-In-Five-Hours/">joing Instagram</a> and posting a photo with her <i>Friends</i> costars on her account.</p>
