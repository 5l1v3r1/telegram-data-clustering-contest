      <p>She said her eyes were “swollen from crying”, she was “groggy” and “crampy from the surgery,” but “I made it and I want you to know that I’m physically ok”.</p>
      <p>“I’m grateful for my family, friends, doctors and nurses, and all of you who have held my hand through this difficult time. You have no idea how much this means to me,” she added.</p>
