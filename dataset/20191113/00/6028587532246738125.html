      <p>She may not have been officially appointed, but branding genius and lifestyle specialist Miss Diddy has more than earned the title of ‘Ambassador of LA.’ Born and raised in Compton, the southern Los Angeles city that has produced household names like Serena and Venus Williams, Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg, and Anthony Anderson, Diddy has carved out her own impressive lane as the go-to expert for celebrities and brands who want innovative marketing strategies. Diddy got her start in the business while working in the Promotions department of Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music when the label first started, bringing nightlife and entertainment through memorable events. She turned that experience into a full-service agency, the Brand Group LA, that offers marketing, brand management, and event production to high profile clients like Russell Simmons, Mayor of Compton Aja L. Brown, Kevin Hart, Terrence J., Baron Davis, and Jason Derulo. </p>
      <p>Diddy’s talent for relationship-building, or ‘dot connecting’ as she calls it, has made her an expert at brand partnerships, and she’s struck deals with brands like Lincoln, Hennessy, Neiman Marcus, American Airlines, the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), CIROC, D’Ussé VSOP Cognac, and Remy Martin. “I’ve been blessed to have really strong resources and really great relationships,” she explained, “and the biggest thing for me is making that work for everybody around me.” </p>

      <p>Her resume certainly backs that up. Just last year, Diddy gracefully juggled event management projects with the Mountain Dew x Kevin Hart partnership and the official Atlantic Records album release event for the late great Nipsey Hussle’s ‘Victory Lap’ album, hosting a star-studded dinner and a rooftop album party at the same venue on the same night, just hours and floors apart. Just the following year, her partnerships, events, and efforts were a part of the  NBPA closing a five-year partnership agreement with the government of the Bahamas after the organization hosted its first All-Star event on the Caribbean island. </p>
      <p>Diddy has defied the odds as a young black woman making strides in a male-dominated space while turning a lifestyle and personality into a brand. There’s no magic formula to her success, but if there were, it would include fearless authenticity and faith. </p>
      <p>“I’ve been in the business 15 years by just literally being exactly who and how I am,” Miss Diddy explained. </p>
      <p>Still, she’s able to maintain a genuine relationship with her audience in a way that’s sometimes a challenge for bigger brands where the people making marketing decisions are often disconnected from the black millennial market they want to reach. Diddy still has a direct line to that audience because she sees herself in them. “I am my audience. I’m still that little Black girl from Compton that is trying to figure it out. I’m still that girl, just on a different scale,” she said.</p>
      <p>The emotional connection that fosters allows her to fill the gap between what brands and companies believe they want and the strategy that will allow them to actually reach their target audiences. “I listen to what they think their company’s problem is, and then, from a cultural standpoint, I’ll point out where the issues lay,” Diddy told me.</p>
      <p>While this has made Diddy a highly sought-after brand partner, influencer, and marketing strategist, she’s very selective about which brands and businesses she’ll work with in this capacity. For her, emotional connection is essential to being able to connect with audiences in a meaningful way. </p>
      <p>Diddy cites her partnership with Adidas as a perfect example: “I really love Adidas. I love to wear Adidas. I love their stretch pants and their tracksuits. I love everything about it. So, when Adidas approached me to do a women’s event, I said yes, because I’m emotionally attached to it. I think that you lose authenticity and a genuine audience if you’re not connected,” she noted. </p>
      <p>Adidas is one of the brands Diddy notes is one of the brands in the fashion space that is handling the lifestyle aspect well. From their marketing and partnerships to their designs, she finds that they execute in away that appeals to millennial audiences. She also names Sonya B Boutique as another solid example, with their online boutique and storefronts leading the wave in fashion for younger women. </p>
      <p>Diddy noted that what strong lifestyle brands do is learn to balance tradition with trends. “I do believe in doing things unorthodox, but I’m a very old school type of person, and there’s a reason tradition is tradition. When you stay true to what you’re doing, you can only grow stronger. Doing every viral trend is a terrible idea. Some of them work, but they don’t last that long and everyone’s attention is so short,” said Diddy. </p>

      <p>Instead, Diddy suggested that brands trying to secure that lifestyle element should connect with true influencers in the market they want to tap. “Get to the gatekeepers. It’s not about the number of followers. People that have influence is what matters,” she pointed out.</p>
      <p>An influencer of sorts herself, some of Diddy’s own partnerships have utilized the pull she has in certain spaces, like her work with her hometown’s Mayor, Aja Brown. Together, the two are working on developing a stronger economic system for Compton’s inner city. “We understand that not only having a seat but creating the seats is w here the power is, and the power is what changes the world,” Diddy said. </p>
      <p>Though her client and brand partner list include big players in politics, sports, and entertainment, Diddy emphasized the value of creating opportunities for partnership and collaboration for friends and up-and-comers with potential as well. She advised that building net worth in your network isn’t just about putting money in your pockets in the short term. “I think that it’s important that you put people in positions because life is a roller coaster…Hopefully, whenever that time comes for life to drop for you, you put enough people in a position that they’re able to pull you right back up,” Diddy explained. </p>
      <p>Take it from the woman who’s connected the dots all across LA’s entertainment industry, she is creating magical moments and powerful partnerships and as a result setting the bar for lifestyle marketing at an all-time high. </p>
