      <p>The Open Up 2020 Challenge finalists have been announced today, putting the most promising fintech firms that use open banking to transform how people in the U.K. manage their money on a pedestal. Run by Nesta Challenges in partnership with Open Banking Limited (OBL), 15 companies have been awarded £50,000 of the £1.5 million prize with Toucan, Kalgera and Wagestream also receiving an additional £50,000 due to their focus on financial inclusion issues and addressing financial wellbeing for the elderly and the vulnerable.</p>
      <p>Research conducted in line with the launch of the Open Up 2020 Challenge found that millions struggle to keep on top of their finances, with 29 percent regularly running out of money each month - approximately 15.2 million people.</p>
      <p>15 concepts were selected from the 107 entries to move to the final round: five focus on helping people manage their money, two help people navigate house issues and the other two address the U.K.’s savings crisis.</p>
      <p>The fintechs will now work with Nesta Challenges and OBL to develop and will receive marketing, business mentoring and service design help before three or four finalists are named winners in July 2020, receiving a further £150,000 - £200,000 each to invest into their idea.</p>

        <b>Financial abuse</b>
      </p>
      <p>While I’ve spoken to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/madhvimavadiya/2019/01/14/payday-poverty-and-financial-fitbits-how-wagestream-is-eradicating-post-christmas-number-crunching/#22ed401c474a">Wagestream in the past about their crusade against payday poverty</a>, I decided to focus on what Toucan and Kalgera are doing to support those with impairments like dementia or older and vulnerable people in general.</p>
      <p>Dr Dexter J.A. Penn, Founder and CEO of Kalgera, explains that there are over 900 million older people in the world with 12.2 million in the U.K. A staggering 53 percent of them report being targeted by fraudsters and according to UK Finance 2018 reports, individuals in the U.K. lose £1.2 billion to fraud.</p>
      <p>There are over 900 million older people globally and 12.2 million in the UK (ONS 2018) and 53% of them report being targeted by fraudsters. Annually, individuals in the UK lose £1.2 billion to fraud (UK Finance 2018). Kalgera is a personal finance platform that helps older and vulnerable people better understand their finances and securely alerts their trusted family and caregivers to signs of financial vulnerability to help prevent fraud.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is important that older and vulnerable people understand their finances and have a way of securely alerting their trusted family and caregivers to signs of financial vulnerability, preventing fraud – which is what Kalgera offers.</p>
      <p>In a similar way, as Co-founder and CEO, Bailey Kursar highlights, Toucan focuses on helping those in vulnerable circumstances “delegate financial admin and get support managing their money from someone they trust, like a carer.</p>
      <p>“There are over 17,000 applications for Lasting Power of Attorney every week, a figure that’s growing, yet tools to help people actually carry out their delegated duties don’t exist. That’s the problem we want to solve.”</p>
      <p>Kursar continues to say that: “Toucan’s own research with leading research charity The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute has indicated that many people with impairments like mental health problems are using risky workarounds in order to get support from someone they trust.</p>
      <p>“One in five have shared their online banking credentials with someone else in order to delegate financial admin, putting them at risk of being taken advantage of.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emerging tech</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Toucan is ensuring that these people have a secure way of sharing information flexibly, machine learning is also being used to help combat financial exploitation. “Using transaction data at scale we can pinpoint when we think someone is most at risk and reach out to provide proactive support.”</p>
      <p>The Kalgera Founder and CEO has a similar view and found that “older people made financial decisions in tandem with their families but were sharing their account login details to do this which can contribute to abuse.”</p>
      <p>This fintech firm uses open banking to enable secure and auditable ‘view-only’ information sharing without compromising accounts. “Our unique delegated governance model uses neuroscience, machine learning and network economics to detect current unusual activity as well as predict and anticipate future changes in financial vulnerability.</p>
      <p>“Elder financial abuse has occurred silently for a very long time and has colored aspects of mental capacity and adult safeguarding legislation. However, the world has become more complex with financial matters becoming increasingly abstract and paperless.”</p>
      <p>Digital transformation has arguably made older people more vulnerable to scams, especially as fraudsters are taking advantage of those with cognitive impairment. Additionally, as Dr. Penn says, “people over 55 years own 63 percent of the £12 trillion personal wealth in the U.K. and this makes this group a prime target for fraud.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Underbanked</b>
      </p>
      <p>The fintech industry is now at a pivotal point where companies can serve the underbanked and it has emerged that this is the next big market opportunity. Kursar says: “The truth is that fintech has been a transformative movement, but it has come with some challenges.</p>
      <p>“The way we spend, save and borrow money has changed so much in the last decade; inevitably there will be people who are left behind, or who start to feel overwhelmed.”</p>
      <p>However, times are changing. “The underbanked, those without access to mainstream banking products and services, has never been the priority for newer firms. Until now. Building for them can support the underserved in reaching their personal goals while also unlocking a huge amount of value in the system.”</p>
      <p>Dr Penn echoes this point: “Providing services to people typically overlooked or excluded from accessing mainstream markets is a fantastic market opportunity because it facilitates growth from new business models.</p>
      <p>“Implementing new technology and new approaches to serve the needs of the underbanked will help those individuals save and generate wealth in their communities. This wealth diffuses into the wider real economy and has the added benefit of social impact which Kalgera is deeply committed to achieving.”</p>
      <p>But what sets financial wellbeing apart from financial inclusion? How can you move that one step forward from ‘including’ people, to supporting them?</p>
      <p>Toucan CEO says that it is not about the “labels we use, financial wellbeing or financial inclusion, but the spirit in which we build our products and services. In that spirit, financial wellbeing may well mean building up a savings pot, or starting a pension: things that affect people whatever their background.</p>
      <p>“On the flip side, financial inclusion helps us focus on building tools for people who are often excluded by mainstream financial services; for Toucan, those who need a bit of support with money admin.”</p>
      <p>Dr Penn adds that: “Financial wellbeing is massively important as it weighs on personal decisions and shapes the way we experience the world. Poor financial wellbeing increases the risk of poor physical and mental health, long term illness or disability, back pain, and obesity.</p>
      <p>“Setting meaningful goals, understanding your personal relationship with money and learning your triggers for spending or saving are crucial to improving financial wellbeing.”</p>
