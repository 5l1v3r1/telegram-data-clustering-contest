Du Bois Medal ceremonies at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass. Colin Kaepernick wants to play in the NFL, even if he has to compete to get on the field. A source close to Kaepernick told The Associated Press on Friday: “Colin has always been prepared to compete at the highest level and is in the best shape of his life.” Kaepernick released a video earlier this week saying: “5 a.m. 5 days a week. For 3 years. Still Ready.” (AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)<cite>ASSOCIATED PRESS</cite></figcaption>

      <p>Colin Kaepernick has been waiting three years for his chance to prove to NFL teams that he can still contribute as a quarterback at the game’s highest level.Now, it appears he will have his chance to showcase what he can do.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, the former 49ers quarterback who hasn’t played in an NFL game since 2016, tweeted Tuesday evening that his representatives reached out to him to inform him that the league has set up a private workout for him on Saturday in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Adam Schefter <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28067012/teams-invited-colin-kaepernick-workout-saturday">reported earlier on Tuesday</a> that the workout would take place and that all 32 teams had been invited. Schefter, who obtained a a copy of an NFL memo, indicated that the workout would include on-field work and an interview and that both video of the workout and the interview would be made available to NFL teams.</p>
      <p>According to the memo, the league had been in touch with Kaepernick’s representatives earlier this year and discussed “some possible steps” and that Kaepernick’s team had indicated the 32-year-old quarterback’s level of preparation was at a point that he is now ready to work out for NFL teams and be interviewed.</p>
      <p>According to Kaepernick’s representatives, the former 49ers star who led the team to its most recent Super Bowl appearance, has been working out five days a week and is in good enough physical condition to again be part of an NFL roster.</p>
      <p>The league responded with the chance to put his skills on display.</p>
      <p>“We have therefore arranged this opportunity for him to work out and for all of the clubs to have the opportunity to evaluate his current readiness and level of interest in resuming his NFL career,” the memo read.</p>
      <p>The New York Times, which had also reviewed the memo, reported on Tuesday that Kaepernick’s representatives requested that the workout be moved to Tuesday since NFL teams travel on Saturdays, but that that request was denied by the league.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick began protesting police brutality and racial injustice in 2016 by kneeling on the sidelines during the playing of the national anthem. He opted out of his    contract with San Francisco in March of 2017 and has since hinted that he may be ready for a return to professional football.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick reached a settlement with the NFL earlier this year along with Panthers safety Eric Reid. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed but The Wall Street Journal reported that the amount would be less than $10 million after legal fees and The Times followed with a report that said the amount would be “considerably less” than $10 million and that Kaepernick and Reid would receive equal amounts.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, who previously suggested he could play at the XFL and Alliance of American Football, tweeted Tuesday that he has been in shape and “ready for this” for three years. Reports earlier this year suggested that Kaepernick was seeking $20 million to play either in the XFL or AAF.</p>

      <p>Last month, Kaepernick’s agent, Jeff Nalley, issued a press release that indicated he had reached out to all 32 teams about his client’s employment and that he had received little to no response.</p>
      <p>“In 25 years, I have seen nothing like it,” Nalley wrote in the release. </p>
      <p>He indicated that Kaepernick conducted a visit with the Seahawks in 2017 but did not work out. Kaepernick’s last contract paid him $14.3 million and while he has not played for the past three years he has maintained a lucrative deal with Nike that is widely reported to be in upwards of $5 million per year over a five-year span.</p>
      <p>Now, it appears that Kaepernick is ready to take his shot at the NFL. </p>
      <p>“Can’t wait to see head coaches and GMs on Saturday,” Kaepernick tweeted. </p>
