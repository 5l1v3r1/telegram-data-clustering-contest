      <h2>Lord Alan Sugar's Apprentice adviser Claude Littner sparked a Twitter storm when he told nurses struggling on low pay they should take second jobs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:29:26+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:29</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>An adviser on Lord Alan Sugar's BBC show The Apprentice has sparked fury by suggesting nurses struggling to get by should work more.</p>
      <p>Claude Littner has been criticised for his suggestion nurses should work more hours or get a part-time job to make ends meet.</p>
      <p>His comments that it would be "less demeaning than visiting a food bank" saw the British-American businessman come under fire today.</p>
      <p>Mr Littner, who works as an adviser on the reality show, doubled down on his views on struggling nurses on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> despite a flood of criticism.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "If a nurse or anyone else need to make ends meet, nothing wrong with extending hours or finding part time work."</p>

      <p>Many critics were quick to point out that many NHS nurses already work long hours for low pay, and their shift work affected their ability to find second jobs.</p>
      <p>But Mr Littner wrote there was: "nothing wrong with extending hours or finding part time work."</p>
      <p>His comments come as reports of nurses forced to resort to using Britain's foodbanks.</p>

      <p>Twitter uses slammed Mr Littner's suggestions, telling him shift-working nurses were "exhausted."</p>
      <p>Some warned that forcing nurses to take on extra work would leave them tired and stressed, and ultimately could endanger patients.</p>
      <p>However Mr Littner refused to back down, telling the Twittersphere his own niece was a nurse.</p>
      <p>The British-American businessman claimed she managed to hold down a side-hustle, tweeting: "My niece is a nurse &amp; has an online business that generates income.. result torrent of abuse!"</p>
      <p>In a later post, defending himself from the onslaught of criticism, he said: "No good deed goes unpunished! I responded to a nurse who stated that she could not make ends meet. I suggested that as a stop gap she might find some part time work to make ends meet."</p>

      <p>But some who responded to Mr Littner's tweets suggested the businessman was out of touch.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Claire Yuen wrote: "This response surprises me.. we can't all work for Lord Alan Sugar and have a 6-figure salary!</p>
      <p>"I thought you would have expressed the disgust in how little our NHS and emergency service workers actually earn. My opinion on you has changed Claude, what a shame."</p>
      <p>Mr Littner retweeted some Twitter users who supported his views, with some saying that nurses had made a choice to follow that career path and shouldn't "whinge" about the outcome.</p>

      <p>Mr Littner also wrote that he respected nurses, acknowledging there is a national shortage and that he believed they should be paid properly: "Nursing is a fine profession. No question nurses work long hours, take on responsibility and should be remunerated accordingly."</p>
      <p>His comments come as leaders warn <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> will bring fresh pressures on the NHS, as EU staff who are plugging massive shortages in the UK's hospitals face uncertain futures and fresh immigration costs to move here.</p>
      <p>And the number of people applying to study nursing in England has fallen by more than 13,000 since 2016.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nurses-champion-jon-ashworth-pledges-20850732">The Mirror reported</a> earlier this week that Labour has promised to recruit 24,000 extra nurses if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> becomes PM – while the Tories will fall 10,000 short if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> stays in power.</p>
      <p>Hospital waiting lists are at an all-time high of 4.4 million, and on Tory Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s watch 18-week waits for treatment have soared more than 150,000, from 504,000 to 662,000.</p>
