      <p>DAVIE, Fla. (AP) - Rookie linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel has been activated from injured reserve by the Miami Dolphins after missing the first nine games with a foot injury.</p>
      <p>Van Ginkel was a fifth-round draft pick in April.</p>
      <p>The move means Miami cornerbacks Xavien Howard (knee) and Aqib Talib (ribs) must remain on injured reserve and won’t return this season.</p>
      <p>Howard played in only five games this year. Talib was already injured when acquired from the Rams last month along with a fifth-round pick for an undisclosed future draft choice. He becomes an unrestricted free agent after this season.</p>
