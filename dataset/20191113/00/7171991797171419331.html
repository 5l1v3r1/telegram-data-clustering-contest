      <h1>This Arduino Keeps Its Eyes On You</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/wd5gnr1/" target="_blank">Al Williams</a></address>
      <p>[Will] wanted to build some animatronic eyes that didn’t require high-precision 3D printing. He wound up with <a href="http://www.nilheim.co.uk/latest-projects/simplified-3d-printed-animatronic-dual-eye-mechanism">a forgiving design</a> that uses an Arduino and six servo motors. You can see the video of the eyes moving around in the video below.</p>
      <p>The bill of materials is pretty simple and features an Arduino, a driver board, and a joystick. The 3D printing parts are easy to print with no supports, and will work with PLA. Other than opening up holes there wasn’t much post-processing required, though he did sand the actual eyeballs which sounds painful.</p>
      <p>The result is a nice tight package to hold six motors, and the response time of the eye motion is very impressive. This would be great as part of a prop or even a robot in place of the conventional <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/09/17/your-next-robot-needs-googly-eyes-and-other-lessons-from-disney/">googly eyes</a>.</p>
      <p>While the joystick is nice, we’d like to see an ultrasonic sensor connected so the eyes track you as you walk across the room. Maybe they could be mounted behind an old portrait for next Halloween. Then again, perhaps a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/02/01/this-creepy-skull-shows-time-with-its-eyes/">skull</a> would be even better.
