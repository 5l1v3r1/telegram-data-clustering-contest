      </p>
      <p>European regulators have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03490-8">approved the first immunization against the deadly Ebola virus</a>. The drug, made by US company Merck, has already been administered on an emergency basis, including to quell the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The drug regulator’s approval means that the product can now be stockpiled and, potentially, distributed more widely — in particular in Africa. Seven other Ebola vaccines are in various stages of clinical testing.</p>

        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/climate/epa-science-trump.html">Influential research could be ignored by EPA</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The administration of US President Donald Trump is doubling down on its controversial plan to forbid the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from basing regulations on certain studies that don't make their underlying data publicly available. The restriction would make unusable some foundational public-health research that relies on keeping people’s confidential information private. <i>The New York Time</i>s reports that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/climate/epa-science-trump.html">a </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/climate/epa-science-trump.html">draft</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/climate/epa-science-trump.html"> supplement to the proposal would apply the rule more broadly</a>.</p>
      <p>“This means the E.P.A. can justify rolling back rules or failing to update rules based on the best information to protect public health and the environment, which means more dirty air and more premature deaths,” says Paul Billings of the American Lung Association. But EPA officials have said they are motivated by a desire for transparency and reproducibility.</p>

        <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-50375482">More plastic than fish in marine nursery</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Larval fish are eating tiny pieces of plastic in the waters off Hawaii. Bits of plastic <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-50375482">outnumbered baby fish by seven to one</a> in areas known to be important nurseries for marine life. Researchers dissected hundreds of larval fish and found that almost one in ten had ingested plastic — including species that are food to birds and other fish.</p>

      <p>Engineer Govind Rao’s solution to spiralling health spending is a sleek, stainless-steel briefcase that contains a series of vials, syringes and tubes. Add a source of electricity, some freeze-dried cell parts and a pinch of DNA, and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03455-x">portable devices allow anyone to start making sophisticated drugs</a> for just a few dollars. And Rao isn't the only one working on this problem: teams at universities and hospitals around the world have been experimenting with producing on-demand pharmaceuticals.</p>

      <p>The results of <i>Nature</i>’s fifth survey of PhD students tell a story of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7">personal reward and resilience against a backdrop of stress</a>, uncertainty and struggles with depression and anxiety. For the more than 6,300 respondents, the positives generally outweigh the negatives: 75% of them said they were at least somewhat satisfied with their decision to get a doctorate.</p>
