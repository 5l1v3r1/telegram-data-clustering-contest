      <p>The country's largest general insurer <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/miscellaneous/newindiaassurancecompany/NIA">New India Assurance</a> on November 13 reported a 61.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in the September quarter (Q2) at Rs 529.97 crore due to a reduction in underwriting loss. This was a stark departure from peers in the industry, who have seen a dip in profits due to rise in flood and crop related insurance losses.</p>
      <p>New India's incurred claims ratio decreased from 98.51 percent in Q2FY19 to 92.85 percent in Q2FY20. The combined ratio improved from 124.7 percent to 117 percent during the quarter.</p>
      <p>A combined ratio below 100 percent means that an insurance company has an underwriting profit. In other words, the premiums collected are proportional to the claims paid in any given period.</p>
