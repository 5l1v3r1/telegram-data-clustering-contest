      <p>Jenner and Naomi Campbell are among nine famous faces who have shared their stand-out party memories in the December issue of British Vogue.</p>
      <p>Jenner said: “Christmas is my favourite time of the year. As soon as November rolls around, it means it’s almost time for our big party on Christmas Eve.</p>

      <p>“We look forward to it all year long. It was traditionally hosted at my house for about 40 years, but now the girls are starting to take it over.”</p>
      <p>She explained that they all “contribute to the creative direction”, including agreeing on a theme.</p>
      <p>Talking about the 2018 event, she said: “Last year, it was at Kim and Kanye’s home, and he conceptualised a very modern take on Dr Seuss’s Whoville.”</p>
      <p>She continued: “Kim takes the lead on deciding all of our style, so I look to her for outfit inspiration, and it’s a lot of fun to plan what we and the kids will be wearing. We like to be co-ordinated so that the family photos are unforgettable.</p>
      <p>“Our guests arrive for a huge dinner, and then we get everyone on the dancefloor”.</p>
