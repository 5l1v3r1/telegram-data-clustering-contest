      <p>Kentucky’s reign as the No. 1 team in the nation lasted less than 48 hours.</p>
      <p>One day after taking over the No. 1 ranking from Michigan State in The Associated Press poll, the Wildcats were stunned at home by Evansville and former Kentucky great Walter McCarty.</p>
      <p>Led by Coach McCarty, Evansville beat No. 1 Kentucky, 67-64, Tuesday night at Rupp Arena for the school’s first-ever win over a No. 1 team. The Purple Aces (2-0) entered as 25-point underdogs. They were picked eighth in the Missouri Valley preseason poll.</p>
      <p>Kentucky (2-1) had been 39-0 as the AP No. 1 team against unranked non-conference opponents at home.</p>
      <p>Kentucky’s last loss as a No. 1 team came Dec. 3, 2016 against UCLA. John Calipari is now 110-43 against unranked opponents and 46-3 against unranked opponents when his team is No. 1.</p>
      <p>“I feel great about it,” McCarty, who won an NCAA title at Kentucky in 1996, said on the SEC Network. “First of all, thank you to John for allowing us to come here and play this game. They showed us awesome hospitality, it was an awesome opportunity.”</p>
      <p>Senior guard K.J. Riley of The Bronx had 18 points and four rebounds in the win, and junior guard Sam Cunliffe went for 17 points and six rebounds.</p>

      <p>“Our guys really worked hard, really were engaged,” McCarty said. “We were the more connected team for 40 minutes, and we just believed and trusted each other and made plays for each other. Guys came out and gave their all.</p>
      <p>“They got a good basketball team. Kentucky’s going to be a really good team that’s going to be around at the end of it. Those young guys are going to grow up and learn. We played a heck of a game tonight.”</p>
      <p>Evansville out-shot Kentucky 38 percent to 37 percent and out-rebounded the Wildcats 38-35.</p>
      <p>Immanuel Quickley led Kentucky with 16 points and nine rebounds and Tyrese Maxey had 15 points.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/sports/ncaabasketball/michigan-state-kentucky-kansas-duke.html">Kentucky’s loss comes one week after they beat then-No. 1 Michigan State in the Champions Classic at Madison Square Garden</a>. The Spartans are now No. 3 behind Kentucky and Duke.</p>
      <p>This marks the first time ever that the No. 1 team suffered multiple losses in November.</p>
      <p>Duke hammered Central Arkansas 105-54 behind Vernon Carey Jr.’s 17 points and 10 rebounds and Matthew Hurt’s 19 points and figures to be the third No. 1 team in as many weeks next Monday</p>
