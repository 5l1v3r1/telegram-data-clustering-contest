      <p>RENO, Nev. (AP) - Reno fire officials say a kitchen fire at a house in Stead that originally was blamed on an exploding oven was started by two teenagers who were burning butane in a marijuana extraction process and suffered severe burns.</p>
      <p>KOLO-TV reports the teenage boys whose names have not been released were flown to a burn center in Sacramento for treatment on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Authorities initially reported an oven explosion sparked the fire that left the house uninhabitable north of Reno Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Fire officials said the teens reported the incident from a short distance away.</p>
      <p>Reno police said they had significant burns to their hands and were told to stay in place for treatment but they left the scene. They were found later Tuesday.</p>
