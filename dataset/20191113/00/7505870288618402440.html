      <h1>Former HBO CEO to join Apple as the company looks to compete with Netflix and Disney+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:06:04+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:06</time> by <a rel="author">Yoni Heisler</a></address>
      <p>It’s crazy how fast the media landscape has changed in just a few short years. Not too long ago, Netflix was the bonafide king of streaming without a challenger in sight. These days, Netflix is seemingly under siege from all angles as the streaming giant faces competition from a growing array of media giants. Aside from traditional competitors like Hulu and Amazon, Netflix now has to contend with a new streaming service from Disney that offers up an impressive library of content at a remarkably cheap price point.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Apple is also in the mix with Apple TV+. And though it’s no secret that Apple currently doesn’t pose much of a formidable threat given its paltry selection of media content, Apple undeniably has more money to spend than anyone else as it looks to shore up its media library with high-quality content.</p>
      <p>With that said, a new report <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbo-ceo-richard-plepler-heading-apple-1254242">from <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> relays that former HBO CEO Richard Plepler — who helped deliver a number of iconic HBO programs — may be joining Apple as part of a new development deal to bring exclusive and top-notch content to Apple.</p>
      <p>Nothing is official just yet, but the report claims that a deal might be done and ready to go before the end of the year.</p>
      <blockquote>Plepler, one of the most respected and highly regarded executives in the industry, departed HBO earlier this year in a move that stunned the TV community.<br/>Sources say Apple TV+ heads of worldwide video Zack Van Amberg and Jamie Erlicht are leading the charge to secure a production deal with Plepler, who has a long roster of ties to the industry’s most sought-after creators and stars alike. Plepler would be the latest high-profile production deal the duo made at Apple and join a roster that also includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, A24, Sesame Workshop and the parent company of Peanuts.</blockquote>
      <p>There’s no denying that Apple’s current selection of content is laughable compared to almost every other streaming service on the market, but the company is apparently intent on embracing a ‘quality over quantity’ approach. What’s more, and as we’ve seen play out numerous times in the past, Apple is a patient company and will likely have no issue with taking the roll-out of Apple TV+ at a measured pace.</p>
      <p>Thus far, the introduction of Apple TV+ has been met with lukewarm reviews. While shows like <i>Morning Show</i> and <i>See</i> aren’t quite as bad as some early reviews made them out to be, neither appear to be instant classics either.</p>
