      <p>A study has shown unauthorized immigrants make up less than 1% of Europe's population. The non-partisan Pew Research Center has released <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/11/13/europes-unauthorized-immigrant-population-peaks-in-2016-then-levels-off/">the research</a>, based on data from each EU country and the four EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), showing between 3.9 million and 4.8 million unauthorized immigrants lived in Europe in 2017. The research provides valuable insight into, and context of, the reality of irregular migration in Europe.This is a significant increase from 2014, when Pew estimates there were between 3 million and 3.7 million unauthorized immigrants in Europe, though it's somewhat down from the 2016 estimate of 4.1-5.3 million. The reason for this dramatic increase then plateau is probably easy to guess.</p>

      <p>The surge in people coming to Europe in 2015/2016, commonly known as the 'migrant crisis', saw millions of people arrive on the continent. But as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/balkans-refugee-route-closed-say-european-leaders">borders went up</a> around Europe, and a <a href="https://helprefugees.org/news/eu-turkey-deal-explained/">deal was struck with Turkey</a> to detain people there before they could get any further, the amount of people arriving dropped dramatically.</p>
      <p>Phillip Connor, senior researcher at Pew and a co-author of this report, said the migrant crisis represented an opportunity to undertake this comprehensive review, the first since 2008's <a href="https://emnbelgium.be/sites/default/files/publications/clandestino-final-report.pdf">Clandestino Project</a>: "We've been working on the topic of unauthorized immigration in the United States for 15 years or so. And so, we have been expanding that to Europe. Certainly the recent migration within Europe as a whole, with the 2015 movement of asylum seekers, provides a certain moment in which to actually provide new numbers on this."</p>
      <p>The 'migrant crisis' is not the full story, however. "Unauthorized immigrant" means more than people who came to Europe recently, via Turkey, the Balkans or the Mediterranean, without a visa or official papers. The term, which is considered more neutral than "illegal immigrant" and therefore preferable, encompasses many types of people, including those who arrived a long time ago or who overstayed a visa.</p>
      <p>Though the term does not have a fixed meaning, with potentially narrower and broader definitions including more or less people, for the purposes of this research Pew have gone with a definition focussed on whether the immigrant was authorized to enter Europe, the legal certainty of their position and their likelihood to stay in Europe. That working definition could be summed up as "noncitizens living in their country of residence without a residency permit."</p>
      <p>This includes children born to unauthorized immigrant parents, as European countries generally do not have birthright citizenship. It also includes asylum seekers waiting for a decision on their case (who make up around a quarter of all unauthorized immigrants in Europe), those awaiting deportation and those who have had their asylum case rejected but for various reasons can not be deported.</p>
      <p>(The report also includes estimates for the unauthorized immigrant population excluding those waiting on their case, as that group does have a temporary lawful status. In both estimates, the upward trend between 2014 and 2016 and subsequent plateau are similar.)</p>
      <p>As stated above, unauthorized immigrants make up a tiny fraction of Europe's population, less than 1%. This is notable in itself, but it is thrown in sharper relief when compared to the United States.</p>

      <p>While the unauthorized migrant population of Europe wavers between a low estimate of 3 million in 2014 and a high estimate of 4.8 million in 2017, the estimate for the United States towers above that, never dipping below 10 million.</p>
      <p>Phillip Connor says this comparison gets even richer when you look at it per capita: "Among the 500 million-plus people who live in the EU-EFTA countries, we estimate less than 1 percent are unauthorized immigrants, compared to the United States (with a population of 325 million) which is around 3 percent of the total population. That kind of gives you a sense."</p>
      <p>The research also illuminates the distribution of unauthorized immigrants in Europe. Just four countries, the U.K., Germany, Italy and France, have more than two-thirds of the entire unauthorized population. Germany, of course, leads the pack, thanks largely to Chancellor Angela Merkel's <a href="https://qz.com/1076820/german-election-how-angela-merkel-took-in-one-million-refugees-and-avoided-a-populist-upset/">decision to allow in</a> over a million people at the height of the crisis.</p>

      <p>One more chart to put this all in perspective. The Pew research found that of the total immigrant population in Europe, only 16-20% were unauthorized.</p>

      <p>Phillip Connor says this is salient to consider when thinking about 'how many' people are in Europe illegally: "Of the non EU-EFTA citizens living in Europe, taken as a whole, the majority are authorized immigrants. The minority are unauthorized."</p>
