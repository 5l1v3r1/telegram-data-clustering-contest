      <h1>Kings bench Kovalchuk, team refuses to say for how long</h1>

      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Left wing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilya-kovalchuk/">Ilya Kovalchuk</a> was a healthy scratch for the Los Angeles Kings in their 3-1 win over the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday night, and the team wouldn’t say how long he will be out of the lineup.</p>
      <p>Sportsnet Canada reported before the game that the Kings informed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilya-kovalchuk/">Kovalchuk</a> he is being benched for an extended period. General manager Rob Blake and coach Todd McLellan refused to say whether it was for one game only or longer.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old Russian had two goals and four assists in Los Angeles’ first four games but has only one goal and two assists in the past 13.</p>
      <p>“He was a healthy scratch, but tomorrow is a new day,” McLellan said after the game. “He is on board and has opportunities to go back in.”</p>
      <p>McLellan said he is treating <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilya-kovalchuk/">Kovalchuk</a> the same way he would other players who are struggling. The coach cited right wing Tyler Toffoli being a healthy scratch for a game two weeks ago and left wing Adrian Kempe also being scratched on Tuesday. Those two players, though, don’t have the star power or $18.75 million, three-year contract <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilya-kovalchuk/">Kovalchuk</a> does.</p>

      <p>“If they had to come out and watch one, then so does he. We treat them the same,” McLellan said.</p>
      <p>The Kings are tied with Minnesota and Ottawa for the fewest points in the NHL with 13 and are 2-6-1 in their last nine games.</p>
      <p>Blake said he met with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilya-kovalchuk/">Kovalchuk</a> before the game, but the decision to bench him was made by McLellan.</p>
      <p>“We’re in last place, right? We changed a lot of lineups,” Blake said. “We’re trying to find combinations that work, try to score some goals.”</p>

        <p>This is the second straight year that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilya-kovalchuk/">Kovalchuk</a> has found himself in and out of the lineup, which team captain Anze Kopitar said was not what anyone envisioned.</p>
        <p>“It’s not a great situation,” Kopitar said. “Kovy is a good guy. There’s nothing wrong with the attitude or anything. For whatever reason, it is not working on the ice.”</p>
