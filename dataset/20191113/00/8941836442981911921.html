      <p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - State health officials say three more cases of severe lung injury related to the use of e-cigarettes for vaping have been confirmed, bringing the total number of cases in New Mexico to 20.</p>
      <p>The state Health Department announced the additional cases Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In all, more than 2,000 Americans who vape have gotten sick since March, many of them teenagers and young adults, and at least 40 people have died.</p>
      <p>Thirteen of New Mexico’s patients have required hospitalization in intensive care units.</p>
      <p>Of the patients interviewed by the state health department, more than three-quarters reported the use of THC, the high-inducing part of marijuana. Three patients reported only nicotine use.</p>
