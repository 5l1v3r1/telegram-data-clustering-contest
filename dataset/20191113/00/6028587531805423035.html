      <p>Maybe it’s a blessing in disguise that <a href="http://www.moritzvs.com/">Moritz von Stuelpnagel</a> spent his early years in New York City working as a waiter at a café. The Tony-nominated Broadway director<i> </i>is drawing on the restaurant training of his leaner years as research to direct <a href="https://www.theresarebeck.com/">Theresa Rebeck’s</a> fast-paced and fiery restaurant comedy, <a href="https://mcctheater.org/tix/seared/"><i>Seared</i></a><i>, </i>now running at MCC Theatre. <i>Seared</i> marks Von Stuelpnagel’s second time working on a Theresa Rebeck play. In 2018, he directed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/theater/bernhardt-hamlet-review.html"><i>Bernhardt/Hamlet</i></a> on Broadway. The MCC production of <i>Seared</i> stars Broadway veteran <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Esparza">Raúl Esparza</a> as Harry, a hot-tempered, tattooed chef at a tiny Brooklyn restaurant. Harry’s demands for the most expensive ingredients as the business struggles concern his business partner, Mike, (<a href="https://www.davidmason.info/">David Mason</a>), so much that he sneakily hires a consultant, Emily (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysta_Rodriguez">Krysta Rodriguez</a>), to give the small business a makeover. Harry resists Emily’s aid until sparks fly between the two, but even then, he doesn’t trust the lucrative changes she makes, including bringing in a prominent critic to review the restaurant. Meanwhile, the only remaining staff member is the voice of reason, Rodney (a scene-stealing <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4465857/">W. Tré Davis</a>), who tries to keep everything running smoothly in the restaurant as tempers flare in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>During all of this, audience members can soak up the mouth-watering aromas of all of the real foods that Harry is cooking. They will no doubt leave hungry. Esparza trained with professional chef <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/theater/raul-esparza-seared.html">Benjamin Liquet</a>, for the role and is cooking every dish in the play in real time. This is where Von Stuelpnagel’s magic is called in, supporting actors in seemingly impossible roles and guiding them to virtuosic feats. Similarly, Von Stuelpnagel directed actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Boyer">Steven Boyer</a> in his Tony Award-nominated performance in <a href="https://www.ensemblestudiotheatre.org/robert-askins">Robert Askins’</a> <i>Hand to God. </i>Von Stuelpnagel was also nominated for a Tony Award that year, for directing <i>Hand to God,</i> and nominated again for Broadway<i>’s Present Laughter </i>in 2017. Boyer played Jason, a lost young boy in a small Texas town whose satanic hand puppet, Tyrone, takes on a life of his own, leading Jason down a dark path. Boyer was tasked with portraying both Jason and Tyrone; in some instances, the only two characters on stage. The New York Times raved, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/theater/review-hand-to-god-features-a-foul-talking-puppet.html">“Mr. Boyer’s performance as Jason is tender and touching, his performance as Tyrone outlandish and hilarious; put them together and you have that rarely seen (although often hailed) acting achievement: a true tour de force.”</a></p>
      <p>The link between such skillful performances as the one Esparza gives in <i>Seared</i>, seamlessly cooking multiple dishes while battling his colleagues in an effort to uphold the restaurant’s integrity, and Boyer’s hilarious turn as both Jason and Tyrone, point to a director who finds joy in complications and obstacles. Von Stuelpnagel is a director of great curiosity and generosity of spirit towards actors. He is clearly delighted to do the work he does. When discussing his process, Von Stuelpnagel declares, “I have a dream job. I get to go to work every day and actors put on a show for me. And if I don’t like it, I can change it. It’s the best kind of job I could ask for, and it should be fun.”</p>
      <p>I spoke to Moritz von Stuelpnagel about the challenges and research involved in bringing <i>Seared </i>to life<i>. </i>He also admitted what directing note he took from a Michelin star chef who saw the production.</p>

        <b>Risa Sarachan: What brought you to this project?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Moritz von Stuelpnagel: </b>Theresa has been a writer that I’ve long admired and wanted to work with. I think she writes characters who are messy and hungry and impassioned. We were partnered on this project first at <a href="https://wtfestival.org/main-events/seared/">Williamstown Theatre Festival</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandy_Greenfield">Amanda Greenfield</a> and got to do a production of it up there. It was just a fantastic collaboration, you know; she's has given me a lot of trust, and I think that I've just really enjoyed being in the world of the people that she's created.</p>
      <p>Also, the show is exciting for me because I worked in restaurants when I was a young struggling artist, you know, in the heat of the kitchen, and it's not a cliche. The people who inhabit this play are all really fighting to keep themselves afloat in the midst of a restaurant that's about to go under and a room full of hungry customers. It makes for a very high stakes kind of comedy, which is my favorite kind.</p>

      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>Since this is your second collaboration with Theresa, what have you learned from working with her?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel:</b> I think Theresa has a love of actors that you can see in the way that she writes. She wants to empower actors with some delicious things to do and say and some exciting challenges, and I think in that way, we are similar. I feel like the virtuosity of the performer is one of the things that makes going to the theater so exciting. To see someone in real-time do something we have no idea that they would ever be able to do and in this case, it is watching, for example, Raúl Esparza cook up a storm while arguing his heart out and fighting for this restaurant that he loves. Hopefully, there is some small amount of danger; I know there is on my end at least, about whether he will be cutting himself or burning himself while doing it.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan:</b> And he has cut and burnt himself, yes?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel:</b> Listen, I'll say this, it is a sharp knife. We had a chef consultant work with us, and he said, “you know frankly, using a sharp knife is safer than using a dull one because it's easier to control.” Though we worked really hard at knife skills when we asked him, you know, how we might best learn to avoid cutting ourselves, he said, “well, you're going to cut yourself and then you're going to learn.” He said, “that’s how I did it.” [Laughs.] I think luckily we've avoided that so far, knock on wood, you know, in any extreme way. That’s a testament to how quickly Raúl learns and how dextrous he is.</p>

      <p><b>Sarachan:</b> Who was the chef that you worked with for that?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel</b>: His name is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chef_ben/">Ben Liquet</a>. He used to work for Esca<b>, </b>and then he was a private chef for a while. I think he did some dinner parties for De Niro, and also Mandy Greenfield is the person who originally put us together. He's very booked up during the summer season out in the Hamptons. You might find him at a dinner party or two. He's just been the absolute best. He wrote all the recipes for the show. They don't only look good and fit inside dialogue in which we need to accomplish them, but they genuinely are delicious. It's possible the director might have stopped in rehearsal during tech once or twice to grab a plate of gnocchi off the stage. I’m not going to say it didn't happen. I can also tell you that the crew eats for free every night as soon as the dishes leave the stage and disappear. Frankly, that is a feat in and of itself because this is the hardest working stage crew that I have seen in a long time. I mean they're preparing the food for an hour or so before the show starts, they start doing the dishes almost immediately after the play begins and continue well after curtain call. It's like a working kitchen backstage.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan:</b> You've worked with so many actors tasked with doing nearly impossible feats. As a director, how do you approach guiding these actors through their virtuosic performances?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel:</b> I think any challenge the actor is thrown only heightens the stakes and also becomes an additional vocabulary for expression. Obviously, if you've got a puppet that becomes an extension of how you're expressing yourself, the same holds true for watching an actor navigate a kitchen and cook dishes. You can tell in the way that he's cooking what's happening for him emotionally, and to me, that becomes a further avenue to explore who this character is and what he’s about. It's a kind of dance, and we talked about that several times, you know, how highly choreographed the show needs to be and also loose and fluid in the midst of that so that he can have room to respond and listen and change night to night. In rehearsal, there’s some balance that we have to strike between the technical requirements of something that's so complicated, but also figuring out how to leave room for the human inside of it. So, it's not only a machine executing a bunch of moves, but you see all of Raúl coming through, you know, in the doing of what he's been tasked with. And that, to me, is a really exciting and unique theatrical experience.</p>

      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>Besides working with a chef, what kind of research did you and your actors do?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel:</b> It helps that I also have some experience in restaurants. What I took away from that is just how virtuosic what happens behind the scenes of so many places in the city is. It does have its own theatricality in ways that we don't often get to see. I mean now we have chefs tables and a way of sort of peeking through to see what they're up to back there, but it's incredible. It was important to me that we try to honor that as much as possible.</p>
      <p>Raúl also observed a couple of shifts at a restaurant near the theatre called Gloria, and that was also helpful. You know it's interesting, every restaurant has slightly different systems. One of the things that we were trying to explore is the system that the chef and this team have created and how does that change when the consultant comes in and tries to revamp everything. It also really helps having a chef consultant work with us. You know, he could keep us honest as well. So all of that was a big collaboration. It's just the problem solving of what this specific script demanded.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan:</b> Was there also a conversation about separating the technicality of those relationships that actually exists within the restaurant world?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel:</b> In that respect, the intense intimacy of a high-pressure situation that you get in a restaurant is not altogether dissimilar from what many of us have experienced in the theater. When a group of people are working close to each other and are in a stressful environment, emotions run very close to the surface. So, in a way, we as theatre people had an immediate connection to all of that. [Laughs.]</p>
      <p>I also think there is an inherent romance to what happens in a restaurant. First of all, you've got these diners who are looking to enact a kind of fantasy and be catered to. There's an inherent sensuality to cuisine that is part of the experience, and part of what drives people to that industry is a love of food and a love of the sensuality of taste and consumption. It's a place that brings people together. In the midst of it, you know, the pace of service is so fast that no one has the luxury of being diplomatic or polite or anything other than who they really are, and that brings out the best and worst in people. Then also, I suppose, not unlike the theater, it’s an environment that's riddled with alcohol. [Laughs.] And that isn't just the people eating, it's also everyone working there at the end of the shift, you know, whenever your shift is over. I know that that staff drink is well-earned and often looked forward to.</p>
      <p>It's funny we had a Michelin star chef come to the show, and of course, we were all incredibly nervous to know what he would think of the show. We wanted to honor his craft and the story of what happens in a lot of restaurants. He said, “I've got one note for you. At the end of the shift, you don't have the capacity to savor and sip a glass of wine. It’s all you can do to not down it in one gulp.”</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan:</b> And that’s when you added that moment?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel:</b> Yes, and that’s an easy enough note to take, and we were thrilled to use it.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>What advice would you give to young directors?</p>
      <p><b>Von Stuelpnagel: </b>I think the thing that has freed me up most as an artist is releasing the obligation of having to know anything about anything definitely. Obviously, an artist has to be in touch with their instincts, and part of that is being curious. More than anything, curiosity is so much more valuable than certainty because the exploration of any kind of art form stops as soon as you're certain. I think in something as collaborative as theatre, being curious and inquisitive and open to everyone's voice and viewpoint is the thing that leads to some really rich conversations.</p>
