      <h1>Flybe announces summer 2020 schedules</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Alex McWhirter</a></address>
      <p>Flybe has announced the first draft of its summer schedules for next year, when the airline will be <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/10/15/flybe-to-rebrand-as-virgin-connect/">rebranded as Virgin Connect</a>.</p>
      <p>Most schedules are effective March 29. But note that tickets are not on sale before November 14.</p>
      <p>The big news for Londoners is that Flybe will be expanding at <a href="https://southendairport.com/">Southend</a>, which is classed as a London airport. It will restart Southend-Glasgow and add new service to Belfast City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, Isle of Man and Jersey.</p>
      <p>Other highlights are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>E190 jet service Belfast and Edinburgh to London City at peak times, something which we have<a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/10/30/flybe-to-upgrade-edinburgh-belfast-to-london-city/"> already reported.</a></li>
        <li>E190 jet service Birmingham-Edinburgh at peak times (presumably to compete with Easyjet which<a href="http://businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/09/19/easyjet-to-launch-edinburgh-birmingham-route/"> enters this route in 2020</a>)</li>
        <li>New E190 jet service Manchester-Stuttgart</li>
        <li>Existing services from Southend to Caen, Groningen, Newquay and Rennes will continue to operate.</li>
        <li>Extra flights from Manchester to Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Hanover.</li>
        <li>Extra flights from Southampton to Paris CDG, Edinburgh and Newcastle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Flybe stresses that todayâ€™s news represents the highlights of its summer 2020 schedules.</p>
      <p>More details will be made available later including, we hope, any routes which the airline will not be operating next summer.</p>
