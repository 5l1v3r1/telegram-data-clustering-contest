      <p>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - Education officials in central Kentucky are planning a girls-only academy that focuses on science, technology, engineering and math.</p>
      <p>The Lexington Herald-Leader reports the Fayette County Board of Education approved a job description this week for a director of the new program.</p>
      <p>Officials hope to start the program next fall with 150 girls in kindergarten through second grade and eventually offer it to girls in grades 3-8.</p>
      <p>Fayette Superintendent Manny Caulk says staff from the University of Kentucky will collaborate on the initiative.</p>
      <p>Special Programs Manager Vee Pryor says girls are on par with boys or above in science and math, but that’s not translating to the workplace.</p>
