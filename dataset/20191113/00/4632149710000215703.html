      <p><i>The narrow underpass is congested with traffic every day during peak hours</i> <br/><br/>For commuters who travel every day between Panathur and the Outer Ring Road, crossing the railway underpass, constructed below the Hosur railway line near Bellandur railway station in Balagere, is a challenge. The narrow railway underpass is choked with traffic every day during peak hours. <br/><br/>However, there is a glimmer of hope now as the expansion on the underpass, with two additional vents, will begin soon. <br/><br/>Recently, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner BH Anil Kumar visited the spot and directed the officials to coordinate with the Railways and speed up the work. <br/><br/>A BBMP official told BM, “The total cost of the project is estimated to be 10 crore. We have paid an instalment to the Railways, which will execute the project. We hope that expanding this railway bridge will ease the flow of traffic in this area.” Ananya S, a techie said, “Crossing this railway bridge becomes more difficult during rainy season due to water logging. I hope the new bridge will have proper drainage facilities.” <br/><br/>Guru Deshmukh, another techie, said “I stay four kilometres away from my office but still it takes 40 minutes for me to reach due to the narrow railway bridge. This bridge-widening project has been in the pipeline for a long time and I request Railways and BBMP to complete it soon.”</p>
