      <p><i>Visitors will take KSRTC bus after parking their cars at the foothills of Nandi Hills</i> <br/><br/>Nandi Hills is one of the most popular destinations to visit from Bengaluru. Every weekend, thousands of people from the city head to the hill station to witness the sunrise and as enjoy misty mornings. As a result, the winding road leading to the summit is often congested. The horticulture department, which manages the hill station, has now decided to put brakes on private vehicles. It wants to follow the forest department’s model at Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta. Travellers will now be asked to park their vehicles at the foothills and travel in a designated Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus to the top. <br/><br/>Dr M Jagadeesh, joint director (parks and gardens), horticulture department said, “We recently conducted a meeting that was the chaired by the principal secretary of the horticulture department and attended by the deputy commissioner of Chikkaballapur, director of horticulture department, special officer for Nandi hills and KSRTC MD Shivayogi Kalasad. The department secretary has initiated the move to build an alternate parking area in the foothills. We have requested the district administration of Chikkaballapur to locate a suitable area. Once located, we will implement traffic ban on weekends.” <br/><br/>He said that the traffic is manageable on weekdays. “Vehicles can easily be parked in the designated parking space on top of the hill. But on weekends, especially on second Saturdays, the rush multiplies fourfold and the existing parking space on the top cannot accommodate all the vehicles. As a result of this, vehicles enter the parks and the garden areas. We want to keep the vehicles outside the green areas on the top of the hill,” he added. <br/><br/>The principal secretary has instructed the Chikkaballapur DC to locate an alternate parking area on the foothill where people can park their vehicles and take a bus to the top, he stated.</p>
