      <p><b>Original Price: </b>$829.99</p>
      <p><b>Sale Price: </b>$679.99</p>
      <p>The HP Envy line has long been an awesome choice for students and professionals alike, and the Envy x360 is a productivity machine. The device may not have the performance needed for gaming, but if you need to browse the web, use productivity apps like Microsoft Office, and other similar tasks, this laptop is an excellent way to go.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, the HP Envy x360 offers an Intel Core i5 processor, along with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive -- making it more than powerful enough for the vast majority of users. It also has a relatively large 15.6-inch display, and can be used in laptop mode, which means that it’s even more versatile. </p>

      <p><b>Original Price: </b>$1,699.99</p>
      <p><b>Sale Price: </b>$1,499.99</p>
      <p>Perhaps you need something with a little more oomph, in which case the Lenovo Yoga C940 is a great option. The laptop features excellent performance, and is even capable of some gaming. That’s thanks to the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card built right into it.</p>
      <p>Apart from the graphics card, you’ll also get an Intel Core i7 processor, with 16GB of RAM and 215GB of storage. Again, that’s more than powerful enough for the vast majority of people, especially those who plan on using the device mostly for productivity or web-browsing. </p>

      <h3>Asus 15.6-inch Touch-Screen Laptop</h3>

        <figcaption>Asus 15.6-inch Touch-Screen Laptop</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Original Price: </b>$1,249.99</p>
      <p><b>Sale Price: </b>$999.99</p>
      <p>For a happy medium between the two previous laptops, this laptop from Asus is the way to go. The laptop offers excellent performance, though not necessarily for gaming, plus it has a relatively large 15.6-inch display.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, the laptop is pretty powerful too. You’ll get an Intel Core i7 processor, with 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive with a 128GB solid-state drive. In other words, there’s plenty of storage space for all your files. The laptop is available for $250 -- which is a pretty impressive discount.</p>
