      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/msnbc/">MSNBC</a> has George Conway, husband of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> counselor Kellyanne Conway and a prominent social media critic of President Donald Trump, as an analyst at the opening of the impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>Conway was identified as onscreen as a “conservative attorney.”</p>
      <p>In the hour before the hearing started, Conway said he was horrified and appalled that few Republicans believe that Trump abused his power as president.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fox News Channel brought Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor who made the case for President Bill Clinton’s impeachment, as an analyst prior to the hearing. Starr said making a charge of bribery against Trump is going to seem like a stretch for people on the street.</p>
      <p>The hearing was being shown live on broadcast and cable news.</p>
