      <p>Amazon and Apple aren’t the only tech giants eyeing the consumer banking market. Alphabet’s Google is too. That’s according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601">Wall Street Journal</a>, which citing a source familiar with the company reported the Internet search giant is gearing up to launch checking accounts in 2020. </p>
      <p>The project is being code-named Cache. Google is working with Citigroup and Stanford Federal Credit Union to handle the accounts for the Internet giant. </p>
      <p>Caesar Sengupta, a Google executive told the paper the checking account is a way to help more individuals conduct transactions online. “If we can help more people do more stuff in a digital way online, it’s good for the internet and good for us,” Sengupta said. </p>
      <p> In addition in empowering people to do more online, a checking account gives Google access to a lot of insight into customers' financial behavior and purchasing choices. Sengupta told the Wall Street Journal Google won’t share the data it amasses with advertisers or third parties. The executive did say that by using the data Google will be able to create products that matter to its customers. To stand out from the scores of fintechs that already offer checking accounts Google plans to layer other features on top such as a loyalty program. It's still deciding if it will charge fees or make it a free checking account to stand out from competitors. </p>
      <p>For Citigroup and Stanford Federal Credit Union, the partnership means it gets access to younger customers who aren’t as likely to bank with one of the traditional players. Thanks to the explosion of digital banks, consumers, particularly younger ones, are getting used to digital banking services, embracing fintechs in record numbers.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear how consumers will react to the new offering given Google and its tech peers have been under increased scrutiny over how they handle consumer’s data. That makes offering financial products a harder sell. To get around any concerns, Google is offering the checking account in the names of Citigroup and Stanford Federal Credit Union instead of its own. Apple went in a different direction with the Apple Card it launched this summer. The iPhone maker teamed with Goldman Sachs to offer the credit card but branded it as an Apple product. </p>
      <p>But backlash against tech companies is mounting, hurting their efforts to expand into the financial markets. Facebook is the most recent example. Its push to launch a digital currency dubbed Libra is facing intense scrutiny with regulators calling on it to halt development. Google has had its fair share of controversy over data practices as well which could cause skepticism about the safety of their data with the product. </p>
      <p>Still, Google’s move into banking isn’t too surprising given it already provides customers with the ability to make digital payments via Google Pay and its Google Wallet. Those products also enable users to track payments and send money to family and friends. It's betting that offering a checking account will resonate more than a credit card like the Apple Card. Amazon is reportedly going the checking account route too, with reports surfacing last year that it was in talks with banks about rolling out a checking account product.</p>
      <p>While the tech giants have the might and the funding to go after the consumer banking market, it’s not clear if consumers are ready to turn over more of their data to big tech, which has a questionable track record when it comes to protecting it.</p>
