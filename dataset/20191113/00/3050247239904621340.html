      <h1>Study: Chinese Blockchain Spending to Exceed $2B by 2023</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:25:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:25</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>China’s spending on blockchain technology will exceed $2 billion in 2023, official state-run publication Xinhua <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/10/c_138544453.htm">reported</a> on Nov. 10. The report claims that blockchain development in China will see a compound annual growth rate of 65.7% from 2018 to 2023.</p>
      <h3>China’s banking sector responsible for the bulk of blockchain spending in 2019</h3>
      <p>Citing a <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=lcCHC45637319">study</a> by American market intelligence firm IDC published on Nov. 7, the report says that the bulk of China’s blockchain spending was geared to the banking sector in 2019. Other high-spending industries reportedly included manufacturing, retail, professional services and process manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Xue Yu, a researcher at the IDC, claimed in the report that official recognition will push blockchain application and generate growth of spending in the sector.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, another report <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/idc-report-blockchain-solutions-spending-in-asia-pacific-bar-japan-to-hit-24-bln-by-2022?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=social">suggested</a> that blockchain solutions spending in the Asia/Pacific region excluding Japan will hit $2.4 billion by 2022.</p>
      <h3>Xinhua calls Bitcoin the “first successful application of blockchain technology”</h3>
      <p>After forecasting a solid growth rate for blockchain over the next 4 years, Xinhua published another industry-focused <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-state-run-media-bitcoin-is-blockchains-first-success">article</a> on Nov. 11. Xinhua, which is by at least one account the world’s <a href="https://www.4imn.com/news-agencies/">largest</a> news agency, exposed millions of Chinese people to Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) by claiming that Bitcoin is “the first successful application of blockchain technology.” Some online commentators considered the coverage the “first time Bitcoin got such positive exposure” from the Chinese government.</p>
      <p>Xinhua’s reports follow a new wave of interest in crypto and blockchain in China that were purportedly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-president-xi-credentialized-cryptocurrency-says-novogratz">triggered</a> by Chinese president’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-chinas-xi-jinping-urges-accelerated-blockchain-technology-adoption">call</a> to embrace blockchain tech. Other government-led media <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-warns-against-cryptocurrency-speculation-amid-blockchain-hype">continue</a> to reiterate the popular “blockchain, not Bitcoin” narrative despite new reports <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bullish-for-bitcoin-china-scraps-plans-to-ban-cryptocurrency-mining">claiming</a> that China will stop considering Bitcoin mining illegal.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, the financial tech arm of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Ant Financial, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/alibaba-subsidiary-ant-financial-tests-its-enterprise-blockchain">launched</a> tests for its enterprise blockchain platform.</p>
