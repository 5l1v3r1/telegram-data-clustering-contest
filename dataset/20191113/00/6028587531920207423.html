      <p>These big dividend payers are about to update the market. Should you buy them today or give them a wide berth?<b>Kingfisher</b></p>
      <p>For income investors working on a tight budget Kingfisher might appear a great FTSE 100 share to sink your teeth into. City predictions of mid-single-digit earnings growth over the next couple of years leaves the company dealing on a forward P/E ratio of 10.1 times. And with these predictions of solid bottom-line expansion comes expectations of more dividend hikes, resulting in bulging yields of 5% and 5.2% for 2019 and 2020 respectively.</p>
      <p>Peel back the façade and the DIY retailer looks nothing like that solid growth or income bet, however. In mid-September Kingfisher said that like-for-like sales at group level dropped 1.8% between January and June, with comparable sales in its UK and Ireland territory moving back into contraction and the revenues slide in its other main market of France worsening as well.</p>
      <p>I fear what third-quarter results scheduled for Wednesday, November 21 will look like, then, and fear that the share price could head lower again. In fact, the heady gains printed in early October (as a ‘no deal’ Brexit was taken off the table for later that month) could worsen the scale of any selling activity.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NewRiver REIT</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’d certainly encourage investors to give NewRiver REIT a pretty wide berth too on account of those pressures enveloping the UK’s high streets, shopping malls and retail parks. Interim results are scheduled for release on Thursday, November 21 and I fear nothing but another chilling set of numbers.</p>
      <p>Now NewRiver didn’t give its shareholders much to lament when it last updated the market in July. Back then it declared that retail occupancy remained high as of June at 95.4% (and up 20 basis points from three months earlier), whilst average rents ticked up to £12.58 per square foot, up 6p from March levels.</p>
      <p>However, footfall across the company’s shopping malls was down 2.5% year on year as the long-term impact of growing e-commerce activity continued, whilst the effect of ongoing economic uncertainty on shoppers’ spending habits is also a big problem for the FTSE 250 firm right now.</p>
      <p>In the last quarter only 0.5% of the firm’s gross income was affected by retailers entering corporate voluntary arrangements (CVAs) or going into administration, but recent evidence suggests that the number of retailers experiencing severe financial distress is growing rapidly. Indeed, British Land announced just today that like-for-like income dropped 3.2% in the six months to September due to its tenants moving into administration or agreeing to a CVA.</p>
      <p>City analysts expect the business to flip back into the black in the fiscal year to March 2019 though I’m certainly not as optimistic, putting its forward P/E ratio of 9.3 times in the shade. Sure, NewRiver might have the financial strength to keep the full-year dividend locked at 31p per share in the current period – a figure that creates a bulging 16.8% yield – but this has all the hallmarks of a classic dividend trap. I plan to continue avoiding the property play, therefore.</p>
