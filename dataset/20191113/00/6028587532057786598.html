        <figcaption>Is saying that marijuana is only a plant really a good argument for legalization?<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Scour the social media feeds of cannabis proponents and there is bound to be someone arguing in favor of legalization simply because it’s <i>only</i> a plant. The idea is that when the Gods of the Universe unleashed the voodoo lightning that gave us this world and its valuable resources that they included cannabis sativa to make sure humans had the only medicine they would ever need. After all, if some supreme being, alien civilization or religious weirdo is indeed responsible for the creation of the cannabis plant, well, how could it be all bad? While many would argue that marijuana is a healing herb capable of curing the incurable and helping people live longer, happier lives, the truth is we still don’t have a solid grip on all of its therapeutic benefits.And we certainly cannot be 100 percent sure that weed was put here on Earth to do good. It could have just as easily been sent by evil spawns of Satan himself, hellbent on leading society into ruins one burned-out brain at a time. I mean, if you believe one, the other is possible, am I right?</p>
      <p>The thing is, not every plant is here for our immediate benefit. There are many poisonous flowers, herbs and other vegetation out there capable of making our lives a living hell if we dare come in contact with or ingest them. It is for this reason that the cannabis advocacy community needs to come up with a new sales pitch when pushing to have weed uprooted from the pits of prohibition. Because the current argument of “it’s only a harmless plant,” just doesn’t resonate strong enough to make sense, not even in the halls of a God-fearing Congress.</p>
      <p>All any lawmaker has to do is point to one of the following plants on this list (or any number of those not mentioned) and this particular argument for why pot should be legal goes down in flames.</p>

        <figcaption>Lily of the Valley is an herb just like cannabis, and it is deadly.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Lily Of The Valley:</b> Convallaria majalis, otherwise known as Lily of the Valley, is an herb with white, bell-shaped flowers and small orange berries. The plant was popularized in Season 4 of the critically acclaimed AMC television show <i>Breaking Bad</i>. It’s <a href="https://csuvth.colostate.edu/poisonous_plants/Plants/Details/123">incredibly poisonous</a> and said to contain more than 40 cardiac glycosides. But this doesn’t mean the plant is all bad, either. Cardiac glycosides have been used for thousands of years to treat various heart conditions. In fact, purified forms of these compounds are still used today in medicines designed for heart-related issues. Still, eating this plant or any part of it could cause a person to suffer symptoms ranging from blurry vision to vomiting. It can even prompt a fatal cardiac event. And that’s never good!</p>
      <p>Interestingly, marijuana (another herb) has also been linked to irregular heartbeats, according to the American Heart Association. It found that <a href="https://www.wltz.com/2019/11/12/study-using-weed-regularly-raises-heart-problem-risk/">cannabis users are up to 52 percent more likely to suffer from arrhythmias</a>. Science really needs to get this one sorted out sooner than later, don’t you think?</p>

        <figcaption>Rhubarb leaves are toxic to humans in large quantities.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Rhubarb:</b> Considering that Thanksgiving is right around the corner, some of you will probably be eating rhubarb pie in the near future. And while this vegetable might seem harmless enough, it actually contains chemical components that can kill, and kill one dead. The leaves of the rhubarb plant are <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002876.htm">poisonous</a>(containing oxalic acid) and are not at all fit for human consumption. In large doses, this compound has been known to cause kidney failure and even death. Yet, I should point out that it would take quite a few rhubarb leaves to snuff someone out. Any amount, however, could make you sick. During the first World War, soldiers reportedly became ill because rhubarb leaves were a highly recommended food source. So, I wouldn’t mess with it. I should also mention that other fruits and vegetables are poisonous, as well. Parts of the apple, cherry and apricot all contain traces of cyanide. And the bright-red berry of the asparagus plant, these, too, carry toxins that can be a detriment to humans. Indeed, it seems that even our food was put here to take us out. <b>Side Note:</b> I am no longer considering becoming a vegetarian.</p>

        <figcaption>Daffodils are also harmful to humans.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Daffodil:</b> Although you would be hard-pressed to find anyone out there in civil society frightened by the thought of daffodils, these popular, yellow flowers are <a href="https://www.poison.org/articles/2015-mar/daffodils">dangerous if they are consumed</a>. The bulb of the daffodil contains a toxic chemical called Lycorine (also found in other flowering plants), which is poisonous to both animals and humans. Anyone who ingests this plant could potentially endure a wealth of nasty effects, including stomach pains, convulsions, low blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias. Whoa! This Easter flower has a dark side.</p>

        <figcaption>Mistletoe is toxic enough to make this your last Christmas.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Mistletoe:</b> Since it is so close to the holiday season, let’s go ahead and toss mistletoe into the mix and blow some minds. This plant, while known for helping dirty old men get kisses at holiday parties, is extremely <a href="https://www.poison.org/articles/2015-dec/mistletoe">toxic to humans</a>. How toxic really depends on which of the three species is consumed. Phoradendron species contains a chemical called phoratoxin. If ingested, it can bring effects ranging from diarrhea to death. The Visum species contains another variation of compounds that produce the same outcome. It’s the leaves and berries where these toxic chemicals hang out the most. But mistletoe also has some therapeutic benefits. The Phoradendron serotinum species has been used for thousands of years to treat arthritis, high blood pressure, epilepsy, and infertility. But this particular breed of mistletoe is less toxic than the others. And it might even <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00052325">help cancer patients</a>, or at least that is what the National Cancer Institute believes. But, much like marijuana, it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a safe and effective treatment. Man, cannabis and mistletoe have a lot in common.</p>

        <figcaption>Tobacco kills around 8 million people a year.<cite>Getty</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Tobacco:</b> Although tobacco is fully legal and a leading cash crop in the United States, it is one of the <a href="https://tobaccofreeca.com/e-cigarettes/nicotine-the-unknown-poison/">deadliest plants in the world</a>. Its leaves contain the toxins nicotine and anabasine, which can be fatal when eaten. But more than that, the consumption of tobacco products has been linked to all sorts of cancer, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking cigarettes has also been shown to increase the risk of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2012/12/11/no-surprise-smoking-and-sudden-cardiac-death-closely-tied/#68a9b8b047c5">sudden death</a>. Sudden death, folks! That’s the act of just dropping dead from the consumption of a plant. Tobacco is responsible for the deaths of somewhere around 8 million people each year. And while there is some controversy on the subject of whether marijuana smoke is as bad for people as cigarette smoke, most experts agree that inhaling any kind of burnt plant matter isn’t healthy. Not exactly a feather in the cap for the medical marijuana camp.</p>
      <p>Well, there you have it. Not all plants are safe. But that doesn’t mean marijuana shouldn’t be legalized at the federal level. What is perhaps more dangerous than the cannabis plant could ever be is the fact that law enforcement is still arresting over a half million people for pot possession every year. There are also SWAT raids with explosives and bullet spraying firearms going down regularly, and people are losing their homes, vehicles and other personal property for simply being suspected of pot crimes. It might be easier to protest prohibition by mentioning that marijuana is only a plant, but the argument might be stronger and more productive without it. Let’s come up with something better.</p>
