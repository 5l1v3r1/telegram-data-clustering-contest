      <p>RIYADH: Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman has reaffirmed the Kingdom’s commitment to diversifying its energy sources, telling the Misk Global Forum 2019 that an expanding renewable energy program will meet the country’s domestic requirements and even allow it to export electricity.<br/>“We are moving ahead with our civil nuclear program,” the minister told the forum’s opening session.<br/>He said the Kingdom’s renewable energy program “will get us into manufacturing and exporting electricity.”<br/>Prince Abdul Aziz added: “We have a new program, a ‘noble’ program, to create a new way of using oil and gas that is different from the conventional ways.”<br/>He told the forum that renewable energy will create jobs for thousands of Saudis and non-Saudis, saying that jobs for both are equally valuable.<br/>“Non-Saudis are important. I was educated by non-Saudis. We should recognize that and not let our nationalism defeat us, and not be ungrateful to them,” he said.<br/>The energy minister said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is providing all Saudis with equal opportunities.<br/>“We know that our women now are enabled, they have an education program,” he said. “We have equal pay for both men and women.”<br/>Prince Abdul Aziz said that social reforms in the Kingdom have turned Riyadh into a “city of joy,” where families had access to a range of entertainment options.<br/>He urged forum participants to learn from their mistakes and never from success. “I am an embodiment of mistakes,” said the prince.<br/>“Even princes have dreams, because they have fathers and grandfathers who had big dreams and we could never let them down,” he said.<br/>“Education, training and resilience are important to keep up and never be broken,” he said, adding: “If I hadn’t had that self-motivation, the notion that you don’t give up, I wouldn’t be here today.</p>
