      <p>PRAGUE (AP) - The Czech prime minister says the state-run Prague international airport is set to expand to meet growing demand.</p>
      <p>Andrej Babis said Wednesday the Vaclav Havel Airport is planning to expand its Terminal 2, which currently serves flights to the visa-free Schengen zone countries, and will build a new runway by 2028, among other things.</p>
      <p>The cost is expected to be up to 55 billion Czech crowns ($2.4 billion) and the number of passengers using the airport could jump to 30 million a year.</p>
      <p>The airport has reached capacity, with 16.8 million passengers using it last year and 17.7 million expected this year.</p>
