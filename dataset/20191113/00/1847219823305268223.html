        <b>In Italy’s picturesque Venice, the water level has risen by 1.87 metres. Two people have died during the floods.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Wednesday, November 12, British news portal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/13/waves-in-st-marks-square-as-venice-flooded-highest-tide-in-50-years">The Guardian reports</a>, the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, is poised to declare a state of emergency after the city was hit by the highest tide in more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>Flooding in the lagoon city reached its second-highest level ever in the wake of the <i>aqua alta</i>, or high waters, which reached 1.87 metres late on Tuesday, November 13, evening amid heavy rain, just short of the record 1.94 metres recorded in 1966.</p>
      <p>An elderly local man from Pellestrina, one of the many islands in the Venetian lagoon, died when he was struck by lightning while using an electric water pump, the local fire brigade said. The body of another man was found in his home.</p>
      <p>More than 85% of Venice was flooded, authorities said, including the historic basilica and many of its squares and alleyways, The Guardian reports.</p>
