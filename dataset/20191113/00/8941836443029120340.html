      <p>KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) - Jurors have recommended the death penalty for a Florida man convicted of fatally shooting two police officers.</p>
      <p>The Orlando Sentinel reports the 12-member jury made its unanimous recommendation Wednesday for 48-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/everett-glenn-miller/">Everett Glenn Miller</a>. The panel found <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/everett-glenn-miller/">Miller</a> guilty in September of first-degree murder. A judge will ultimately decide whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/everett-glenn-miller/">Miller</a> should be sentenced to death or life in prison.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Kissimmee police Officer Matthew Baxter was conducting a routine check into three suspicious persons in August 2017 when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/everett-glenn-miller/">Miller</a> drove up and asked why the officer was bothering people. Sgt. Richard Howard responded, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/everett-glenn-miller/">Miller</a> argued with both officers.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/everett-glenn-miller/">Miller</a> shot Howard and Baxter each in the head and then repositioned both bodies before firing again at their faces. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/everett-glenn-miller/">Miller</a> was later arrested at a bar.</p>
