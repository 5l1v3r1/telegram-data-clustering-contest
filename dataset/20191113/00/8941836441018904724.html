      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court seems likely to overturn a lower court ruling in favor of an African-American media mogul and comedian who’s suing cable giant <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> for racial discrimination.</p>
      <p>The justices appeared to be in broad agreement Wednesday that an appeals court applied the wrong legal standard in allowing business owner <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/byron-allen/">Byron Allen</a>’s $20 billion suit against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> to go forward. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/byron-allen/">Allen</a> has a separate $10 billion lawsuit against Charter Communications.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/byron-allen/">Allen</a> says the cable companies refuse to carry his television channels because he’s black. The companies say his programming isn’t very good.</p>
      <p>The issue at the court is whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/byron-allen/">Allen</a> needs to show in his complaint that race was among the factors in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a>’s decision not to offer him a contract or whether it was the decisive factor.</p>
      <p>Alarmed by the Supreme Court’s intervention, civil rights groups have warned that the court could make it much harder to prove race discrimination in contracting under a civil rights law that dates to 1866.</p>

      <p>A ruling for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> probably would not be the final word. Several justices indicated they think the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco should take another look.</p>
      <p>A three-judge appellate panel allowed the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> suit to go forward after a federal judge dismissed it three times.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/byron-allen/">Allen</a>’s Los Angeles-based Entertainment Studios has 10 television networks, including Cars.tv, Comedy.tv, Pets.tv, Recipe.tv and JusticeCentral.tv. Last year, he bought The Weather Channel. He also has a movie distribution company.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> and Charter Communications, the nation’s two largest cable providers, have passed on carrying <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/byron-allen/">Allen</a>’s channels. The now-merged AT&amp;T; and DirecTV carry the channels after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/byron-allen/">Allen</a> sued them and they settled.</p>
