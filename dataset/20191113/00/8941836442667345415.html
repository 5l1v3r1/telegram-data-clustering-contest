      <p>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) - Tre Harbison rushed for 158 yards and a touchdown and John Richardson kicked a 25-yard field goal with 41 seconds left to give Northern Illinois a 31-28 win over Toledo after blowing a 21-point fourth quarter lead Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The Huskies (4-6, 3-3 Mid-American Conference) kept their bowl ambitions alive by driving 68 yards on 13 plays and using almost 4½ minutes of the clock before Richardson booted his winning kick through blowing snow.</p>
      <p>Toledo’s Eli Peters threw 34- and 13-yard touchdown passes to Bryce Mitchell in the fourth quarter before Ronnie Jones ran in from 7 yards out to tie the game with just over five minutes left.</p>
      <p>Harbison was a workhorse with 32 carries on his way to his fourth 100-yard game this season. Ross Bowers threw for 193 yards and a touchdown.</p>
