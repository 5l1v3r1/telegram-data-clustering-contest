        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, the Freedom From Religion Foundation is at it again.</p>
      <p>Coaches and players at a Missouri high school held an after-game prayer session — and that prompted the atheists across the border in Madison, Wisconsin, to take offense, take up pen and paper, and <a href="https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/36157-missouri-high-school-coaches-must-cease-proselytizing-players-ffrf-warns">shoot</a> off a warning letter to Cameron School District officials.</p>
      <p>Quit the praying — or we’ll sue.</p>
      <p>“We ask that the district commence an investigation into the complaints alleged and take immediate action to stop any and all school-sponsored prayers or religious worship,” FFRF’s attorney Christopher Line <a href="https://ffrf.org/images/CameronDistrictFootball.pdf">wrote</a> in an October letter.</p>
      <p>Line also demanded to know how the school planned to “remedy this serious and flagrant violation of the First Amendment.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>FFRF blames head coach Jeff Wallace and assistant coach David Stucky of proselytizing.</p>
      <p>But here’s the catch: The prayers were reportedly voluntary. And: even opposing team players participated. Moreover — nobody seems to have complained.</p>
      <p>“Superintendent Dr. Matt Robinson responded to the Wisconsin-based group’s complaint, adding that the district has never received a complaint from anyone in the community,” Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missouri-high-school-football-illegal-prayer">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>So why’s FFRF even involved?</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Good question.</p>
        <p>FFRF is simply trying to bully the school into stopping the kids and coaches from praying — as it’s wont to do.</p>
        <p>In February, FFRF <a href="https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/34175-coach-rick-barnes-unconstitutionally-infuses-christianity-in-ut-s-basketball-program">demanded</a> a basketball coach, Rick Barnes, at the University of Tennessee cease and desist praying with students, calling his actions “proselytizing” and “unconstitutional.”</p>
        <p>From the FFRF website: “Barnes has also taken his players to church.”</p>
        <p>Imagine. The horror of it all.</p>
        <p>But this is how FFRF makes its money.</p>
        <p>“Oklahoma public school can’t promote religion in holiday concert, FFRF warns,” FFRF.org <a href="https://ffrf.org/news">posted</a>.</p>
        <p>“That rotunda tree is pagan, not Christian symbol — reminds FFRF,” FFRF.org stated.</p>
        <p>“FFRF urges Virginia public school to remove religious sign,” FFRF.org said.</p>
        <p>Bullying, threatening, warning, intimidating, suing: It’s what FFRF does. It’s what FFRF will continue to do until all semblances of religion, particularly Christianity, are wiped from the public face of America. Total secularism or bust — that’s FFRF’s motto.</p>
        <p>But remember: Stand up to a bully, and the bully flees.</p>
        <p>Or, put another way: Resist the devil, and he will flee.</p>
