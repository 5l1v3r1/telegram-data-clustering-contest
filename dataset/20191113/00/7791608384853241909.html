      <p><b>Viewers of</b> the popular game show <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> were left infuriated after a seeming error from the host helped the contestant win a rather significant prize. <br/><b>In the show</b> contestants have to give their answers to quizzes. If their answer is correct, they would be asked to spin a colorful wheel to find out the value of the prizes they would be receiving. <br/><b>Host Pat Sajak</b> apparently misheard a contestant Angela Evans as he could not discern between B and D, resulting in Evans taking home very valuable prizes. Worse still, the mistake was pointed out to have occurred twice in two rounds, per <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/tv-and-film-wheel-of-fortune-error-appears-to-gift-contestant-15000-in-prizes-20191111?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>LADbible</i></a>. <br/><b>Though former</b> US Marine member Evans did not win in the end, and left during the same round when she was misheard the second time, many viewers took to Twitter were upset. They did not think it was fair that she got to stay in the game due to an “error.” <br/><b>Even Evans</b> herself commented in a Twitter thread that accused her of giving the wrong answer. She claimed that she gave the correct answer, but that it sounded different because of her “braces.” <br/><b>However, others</b> were not so convinced, arguing that it was unfair for other participants. One also said the other contestants’ unnatural silence proved that the answer was misheard. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a></p>
