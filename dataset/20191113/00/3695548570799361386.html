        <b>An ex-works Triumph TR2 from the 1955 Le Mans 24-Hour race sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds at the Classic Motor Show.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the Triumph had a guide price of up to £140,000, it finally sold for £258,750 at the Silverstone Auctions sale at the Birmingham NEC.</p>
      <p>The final price represents a new record for the sale of a Triumph TR2.</p>
      <p>Registered 'PKV 374', the TR2 was raced in 1955 by Leslie Brooke and Mort Morris-Goodall and finished 19th in the race marked by accident that claimed the lives of 84 people.</p>
      <p>The Triumph spent two and a half hours beached on a sand bank at Tetre Rouge, but Brooke managed to finally dig it clear and rejoin the race.</p>

      <p>Immediately after the race it was bought by Prince Hussein of Jordan, who owned it for little more than a year.</p>
      <p>It then had several owners before being bought in 1972 by Jan Pearce. A long restoration was finally completed and from the year 2000 onwards it competed in various events, including the 2005 Le Mans Legends support race to the 24-hour.</p>
      <p>Pearce, one of the early members of the TR Register, died in 2015 and the car was sold by his family.</p>
      <p>Nick Whale from Silverstone Auctions said: "To set a world record is a wonderful achievement with the ex-works Le Mans TR2.</p>
      <p>"I am so pleased for the family and to see the emotion throughout the room was a moving experience."</p>
