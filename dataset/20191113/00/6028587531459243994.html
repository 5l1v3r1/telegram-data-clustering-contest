      <p>Disney Plus is live in the wild, and it has arrived with pretty much two things: a massive truckload of nostalgia ranging from 90s cartoons to classic Disney and Pixar movies, and a shiny, high profile new offering in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/09/heres-why-there-are-no-early-reviews-of-disney-pluss-the-mandalorian/#3ef109511937"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, its prestige live-action Star Wars series.But fans may be wondering about where all Disney’s promised Marvel shows are. We have a long, long list of announced shows at this point, many of which feature famous A-list MCU characters and actors, but where are they? And when are they getting here?</p>
      <p>Well, I hope you’re ready to sit around and wait.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, pretty much all Disney’s Marvel shows are very, very far away right now, and they’re mapping out that content for the next few years, rather than having any of them be imminent releases.</p>
      <p>Here’s where we are right now with the announced shows and their dates:</p>
      <p><b>Marvel’s Hero Project (live now)</b> – This is the only new show with “Marvel” in the title for Disney Plus’s launch, and yet it’s…really not a Marvel show at all. It’s about kids who are “real life heroes” which may be perfectly touching and inspiring and yet it’s not really connected to the rest of these at all as a docuseries.</p>
      <p><b>Falcon and the Winter Solider (Fall 2020)</b> – Yes, you’ve read that correctly, the first “real” Marvel show on Disney Plus is not slated to arrive until a year from now. We know a lot about this series, like that in addition to Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie starring, we’re seeing the return of Emily Van Camp’s Sharon Carter and Daniel Bruhl’s Zemo, but its debut is still very, very far off.</p>
      <p><b>Loki (Spring 2021)</b> – This is probably one of the most anticipated shows of the bunch, a limited run series that shows what happens to 2012 Loki after he grabs the Tesseract in <i>Endgame</i>. Hiddleston seems excited about it, returning to the role after his “main timeline” death, but it’s a long ways out.</p>

      <p><b>WandaVision (Spring 2021)</b> – Another spring release for over a year from now, this should be one of the more interesting offerings of the bunch giving that its rooted in 1950s sitcoms, and is supposed to have larger connections to the movie MCU.</p>
      <p><b>What If…? (Summer 2021)</b> – This one is an animated series and the concept features a lot of alternate reality angles that span concepts like Peggy Carter becoming Captain Carter and Steve Rogers never getting the super serum to how Peter Parker would have turned out if Uncle Ben never died. Should be interesting, though divorced from the MCU itself.</p>
      <p><b>Hawkeye (Fall 2021)</b> – Yes, we have now officially moved into <i>two years away</i> territory for these shows. This is the one where Jeremy Renner’s Clint will reportedly train Haliee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, taking his place in the Avengers, or leading a new team.</p>
      <p><b>Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, Moon Knight (???)</b> – These were only recently announced, and are just starting to find their showrunners (<i>Umbrella Academy</i> showrunner doing <i>Moon Knight</i>, <i>Rick and Morty</i> writer doing <i>She-Hulk</i>), so they are very, very early in production. It’s not impossible some of these could be slotted in before the ones with dates above, but it seems more likely that most of them would be after.</p>
      <p>In short, it seems like we have to wait at least a full year before the first major MCU-based Marvel show arrives on Disney Plus. There looks to only be a single MCU movie on deck during that window, <i>Black Widow </i>in May 2020, with <i>The Eternals</i> arriving in November 2020, which may be after <i>Falcon and The Winter Soldier </i>debuts. So we are in a bit of a lull when it comes to Marvel content, but given the <i>Endgame</i> finale, I don’t think that’s the worst thing in the world.</p>
      <p>I am curious about Disney Plus over the next year. The “geek” crowd is really going to mainly just have this first season of <i>The Mandalorian</i> and not much else this year, as I don’t think future Star Wars projects like <i>Obi-Wan</i> are arriving any time soon. So all that nostalgic content is going to have to last a while, it seems, and we’ll see where Disney Plus is at a few months from now.</p>
