      <p>Cmdr. Reann Mommsen, spokesperson for the US 7th fleet, said that the US guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville (CG 62) conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit in accordance with international law.</p>
      <blockquote>“The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The US Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,” he added.</blockquote>
      <p>"All interactions between [Chinese] ships and aircraft were professional and routine” during the transit, a Navy official told Fox News.</p>
      <p>The Taiwan Strait transit was<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201909211076857757-us-navy-guided-missile-cruiser-spotted-in-taiwan-strait-waters---tv/"> the ninth by the US Navy</a> this year. The last one occurred in late September, when the USS Antietam, another guided-missile cruiser, conducted a similar transit.</p>
      <p>The transit comes as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley visits Japan for a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzō Abe to help repair diplomatic relations with South Korea after a recent spat over intelligence sharing between Tokyo and Seoul.</p>
