      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/university-of-arizona/">University of Arizona</a>’s medical college in Phoenix is increasing its enrolling class size to 100 students, up from 80.</p>
      <p>The college says the increase will take effect in 2020 and that it’s a result of increased state funding to help address Arizona’s shortage of physicians.</p>
      <p>The college announced the action Tuesday, saying the increase was approved by the accrediting organization for medical schools.</p>
      <p>According to the college, Arizona’s physician shortage is one of the worst in the nation, meeting only 42% of the need for primary care providers.</p>
      <p>Since admitting its first class of 24 in 2007, the college’s class size increased from 48 in 2008 to 80 in 2012.</p>
