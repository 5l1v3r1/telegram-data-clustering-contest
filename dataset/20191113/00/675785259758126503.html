      <h1>Strengthen fox hunting ban in general election manifestos, say campaigners</h1>
      <h2>TV star Bill Oddie is leading calls for fresh protections for foxes as parties draw-up their offers to voters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:01:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Wildlife presenter Bill Oddie today demands beefed-up protections against fox hunting as political parties thrash out their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> plans.</p>
      <p>Former Springwatch host Bill, 78, urged leaders to place animal welfare at the heart of their manifestos for power.</p>
      <p>The call comes two-and-a-half years after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a>’s 2017 ballot box meltdown was partly blamed on her full-throated support for bringing back fox hunting.</p>
      <p>League Against Cruel Sports patron Bill hopes the December 12 poll will lead to better treatment of wildlife – and closures of legal loopholes to fox hunting.</p>
      <p>He said: “There is a real opportunity here to show unity where there has been division, to commit to a vision of Britain that is a kinder place for all of us to live, where there is an understanding of the importance of protecting the environment around us and all the wildlife that shares our land.</p>

      <p>“Two years ago, Theresa May learned on the doorsteps that an attempt to repeal the Hunting Act directly cost her valuable seats, as public opinion showed irrefutably via the ballot box that hunting has no place in a modern Britain.</p>
      <p>“It is time political parties went further, not only to secure the Hunting Act but to strengthen it; to ensure there can be no excuses for harming wild animals for ‘sport’.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> has previously outlined measures it would launch to strengthen the 2004 Hunting Act, introduced by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a>.</p>

      <p>It published its Animal Welfare Manifesto in August, detailing plans for “closing loopholes that allow for illegal hunting of foxes, deer and hares”.</p>
      <p>They included a review of punishment “to ensure it is an effective deterrent, including consulting on the introduction of custodial sentences, bringing it in line with the penalties for other wildlife crimes”; introducing a “recklessness clause to prevent trail hunts being used as cover for the illegal hunting of wild mammals”, scrapping the “exemption for research and observation”; and axing the “use of dogs below ground to protect birds for shooting”.</p>
      <p>Recent polls show 85% of people support keeping the 15-year-old ban on hunting – and the League Against Cruel Sports wants jail terms for those convicted of illegal hunting.</p>

      <p>Bill added: “I am calling on all parties to include this pledge in their manifestos, to allow themselves to be judged on their compassion and their commitment to our land and our wildlife, as well as their willingness to ensure all those who seek to circumvent these rules are appropriately punished.”</p>
      <p>League Against Cruel Sports chief executive Andy Knott said: “We see day in, day out, how the Hunting Act is being flouted by those who twist and exploit weaknesses in the law to get away with what should be a crime.</p>
      <p>“Enough is enough.</p>
      <p>“Hunting has no place in a compassionate society and we urge all parties, in as robust terms as we can, to commit to a better vision of Britain by placing animal welfare at the heart of their manifestos and by pledging to strengthen the Hunting Act.”</p>
      <p>Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman said: “Labour has always been the party of animal welfare - from banning hunting with hounds to bringing in the landmark animal welfare act.</p>

      <p>“Earlier this year we launched a radical 50-point animal welfare manifesto, the most comprehensive and ambitious programme on animal welfare ever proposed by a major British political party.</p>
      <p>“While the Tories continue with their ineffective mass slaughter of badgers and flip flop on bringing back fox hunting, Labour is determined to bring animal welfare policy into the 21st Century, based on the latest science and understanding.”</p>
