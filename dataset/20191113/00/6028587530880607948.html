      <p>The thing about great zombie horror movies is you can be pretty sure there will be a sequel. Zombie vulnerabilities, on the other hand, are a scary enough proposition without the thought of a second coming. If you use a computer with one of the latest-generation Intel CPUs inside, be that directly via your PC or indirectly when using the cloud, then you could be at risk of a sensitive data-stealing vulnerability called ZombieLoad 2. Researchers have disclosed how a ZombieLoad 2 exploit can allow an attacker to grab data from the operating system kernel itself. Intel has released patches to mitigate the risk but also <a href="https://blogs.intel.com/technology/2019/11/ipas-november-2019-intel-platform-update-ipu/">confirmed</a> that these, "may not completely prevent the inference of data through a side channel using these techniques." Here's what you need to know.</p>
      <h3>ZombieLoad: A brief history</h3>
      <p>To appreciate the <a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/zombieload.pdf">ZombieLoad CVE-2018-12130 vulnerability</a>, you first have to look back to earlier speculative execution side-channel attacks. Thankfully you don't have to type all of that into Google, Spectre or Meltdown will do. Thomas Brewster wrote a good primer on these vulnerabilities in this Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/05/22/spectre-version-4-warning-from-microsoft-and-google-need-to-know/">article</a> from May 2018. The quick version is that speculative execution helps boost the performance of CPUs by, as the name implies, guessing that specific instructions will be needed and running them on the off-chance that they are. If the speculation was correct, then the task at hand is speeded up; if not then the data can be discarded with no downside. In theory. In practice, it was found to be possible to target this speculative execution feature to exfiltrate data from areas of memory otherwise out of bounds to an attacker.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward a year, and in May 2019, the same researchers who uncovered Spectre and Meltdown disclosed a new chip-related vulnerability by the name of ZombieLoad: return of the leaking dead. This microarchitectural data sampling (MDS) vulnerability hangs off the fact that a speculative execution attack can get access to data from out-of-bounds memory locations. What ZombieLoad brings to the exploit threat party is an ability to control the memory buffers concerned to contain the type of sensitive data an attacker might be after, such as passwords and cryptographic keys, as well as triggering the memory access in the first place. Importantly, this triggering can happen in virtual machines as well as PCs and laptops, so the cloud isn't protected from it either.</p>
      <p>While most every Intel chip dating back to 2011 was thought to be vulnerable to the ZombieLoad vulnerability, Intel said that the newer chip architectures such as Cascade Lake were not susceptible to these MDS attacks. Microcode update patches were rolled out to mitigate against the ZombieLoad vulnerability. Unfortunately, it now appears that Intel was wrong, and those patches alone were not enough to protect against ZombieLoad 2.</p>
      <h3>ZombieLoad 2: What's new?</h3>
      <p>In the updated ZombieLoad <a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">disclosure</a> that includes details of the ZombieLoad 2 CVE-2019-11135 vulnerability variant, the researchers suggested that "software-based mitigations in combinations with microcode updates presented as countermeasures against MDS attacks are not sufficient." ZombieLoad 2, they said, enables something called a transactional asynchronous abort (TAA) to work to the benefit of an attacker. The TAA method manipulates the CPU into using a feature called transactional synchronization extensions (TSX) that is designed to drop back to a previous memory point if it detects a conflict with another process. By triggering this TAA/TSX combination, an attacker can extract data from the CPU memory.</p>
      <h3>How serious is the ZombieLoad 2 Intel CPU vulnerability?</h3>
      <p>Like most every side-channel vulnerability, ZombieLoad 2 isn't the kind of thing that your average cybercriminal is going to be able to execute with ease. This probably explains why there have been no known reports of malware in the wild that can exploit the vulnerability. Outside of the research lab theatre, an attacker would need to already have access to the target machine by way of arbitrary code execution, for example. Ask most any security professional, and they will tell you if an attacker is on your system that's game over already, and somewhat negates a further side-channel attack anyway. Why go to all that extra and very complicated, hassle of attempting to pull off a ZombieLoad exploit attack with no certainty of success when you can steal data in a more relaxed way? Most people, most of the time, are going to be better off worrying about being on the receiving end of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/11/11/black-friday-2019-security-threat-us-government-advises-consumers-to-stay-vigilant/">targeted social engineering attacks</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/24/windows-users-warned-to-update-now-as-complete-control-hack-attack-confirmed/">avoiding opening malicious documents</a> and attachments or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/09/27/microsoft-confirms-its-fighting-windows-zombie-attack/">unsafe link-clicking</a>.</p>
      <p>The ZombieLoad 2 CVE-2019-11135 vulnerability only has a "medium CVSS score of 6.5," Jerry Bryant, director of security communication with the platform assurance and security group at Intel, <a href="https://blogs.intel.com/technology/2019/11/ipas-november-2019-intel-platform-update-ipu/">stated</a>, and it "affects only CPU’s that support TSX." Bryant said Intel believed that "the mitigations for TAA and MDS substantively reduce the potential attack surface." However, the statement also confirmed, "the possibility that some amount of data could still be inferred through a side-channel using these techniques (for TAA, only if TSX is enabled) and will be addressed in future microcode updates."</p>
