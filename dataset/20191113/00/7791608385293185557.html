      <p><b>The auction of</b> the Ron and Diane Disney Miller Collection at <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/The-Ron-and-Diane-Disney-Miller-Collection-10149-7.aspx?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Christie’s in New York</a> is expected to fetch up to US$14 million, per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/walt-disney-daughter-s-art-collection-expected-bring-14m-at-auction-1254061?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>. It belonged to the late Diane Disney Miller, Walt Disney’s eldest daughter. <br/><b>The auction</b> will begin on Wednesday evening until Thursday morning this week. There are 40 art items in all, including paintings, drawings, works on paper and sculpture. Disney Miller attempted to keep her father’s own artistic spirit alive by collecting the items. <br/><b>Barrett White</b>, executive deputy chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s, told <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> that the collection is kind of a “celebration” of the “American landscape.” Notable pieces include 19th century paintings by Albert Bierstadt, Richard Diebenkorn’s Ocean Park paintings and the famous portrait of Mickey Mouse byWayne Thiebaud. <br/><b>Diebenkorn’s Ocean Park</b> series is expected to kickstart the auction with the iconic <i>Ocean Park #108</i> that is likely to bring in US$7 million to US$9 million. His works have been well known for compressing three-dimensional imagery onto a two-dimensional surface, as stated in <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>. <br/><b>White added that</b> Diebenkorn met with artists that had been Disney animators, and frequently used his art to “celebrate the California dream.” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Another famous artwork</b> is realist Andrew Wyeth’s <i>Oliver’s Cap</i> that is likely to bring in US$3 million to US$5 million. <br/><b>Thiebaud’s <i>Mickey Mouse</i></b> has the strongest connection to Disney. The artist was an illustrator of other major Disney characters such as Goofy, Jiminy Cricket and Pinocchio. White called the <i>Mickey Mouse</i> depiction a classic reflection of the “optimism of America” as it simply makes one happy. <br/><b>Proceeds from</b> this artwork in particular will go into programming initiatives at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. Other famous pieces will also go towards causes that mean a lot to the Disney family.</p>
