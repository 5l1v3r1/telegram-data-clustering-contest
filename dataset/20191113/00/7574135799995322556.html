      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/christopher-tignor-preps-new-lp-playing-shows-with-low-this-will-destroy-you/"><b>This Will Destroy You, Super Snake @ Asbury Lanes</b></a><br/>Texas post-rock greats This Will Destroy You are on the road supporting their two very solid 2018 albums, <i>New Others Part One and Two</i>. They’re joined by their pal Christopher Tignor for the whole run, and tonight’s NJ show also has appealing local support from Super Snake (mem Trophy Scars). The tour hits Brooklyn tomorrow too.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/schoolboy-q-announces-tour-with-nav/"><b>ScHoolboy Q, Nav @ Avant Gardner</b></a><br/>Schoolboy Q is on the road supporting his new album <i>Crash Talk</i>. His shows are always a great time, and tonight should be no different.</p>
      <p><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11194835"><b>The Gories, Brandy, Mala Vista @ Brooklyn Bazaar</b></a><br/>Led by Mick Collins, Detroit’s The Gories are one of the great garage-punk bands of the last 30 years, championing taste, songwriting and attitude over pure technical skill. They’re always worth seeing and you’re chances of seeing a show at Brooklyn Bazaar are running out.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/chastity-belt-announce-new-lp-co-produced-by-jay-som-share-anns-jam/"><b>Chastity Belt, Strange Ranger @ Elsewhere</b></a><br/>Working with Jay Som, Seattle’s Chastity Belt made their mellowest, most cohesive record yet with the recently released self-titled album. Tiny Engines-signed Strange Ranger open.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/christine-and-the-queens-playing-guggenheim-gala-pre-party/"><b>Christine and The Queens @ Guggenheim Museum</b></a><br/>It’s the 2019 Guggenheim International Gala pre-party with Christine and the Queens are tonight’s entertainment.  Tickets are not cheap, but it’s open bar, tax deductible, and you get after-hours access to the exhibition “Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/david-byrne-now-on-broadway-cast-recording-released-check-out-an-opening-night-video/"><b>David Byrne’s American Utopia @ Hudson Theatre</b></a><br/>David Byrne has retooled his acclaimed “untethered” 2018 for the Broadway stage and while the setlist and arrangements are much like what they were on his tour, songs are now threaded together with new monologues from Byrne, making for a much more theatrical experience.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-brutus-aap-ferg-vic-ruggieroscott-sturgeon-more/"><b>Brutus, Planning For Burial @ Saint Vitus</b></a><br/>Brutus released one of the year’s best and most unique post-hardcore albums with <i>Nest</i> (on Sargent House), and now the Belgian band are finally playing NYC. We haven’t seen them yet but we hear great things. Plus, the gloomy Planning For Burial is always worth seeing too.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/metal-tours-announced-bell-witch-crisix-abigail-williams-killswitch-engage-more/"><b>Crisix @ The Kingsland</b></a><br/>Barcelona thrash band Crisix recently released an album of American Thrash covers (including Vio-Lence, Nuclear Assault, Anthrax, Testament, Demolition Hammer, Exodus, and more), and if you like all those bands but you haven’t checked out Crisix yet, you might wanna take this chance to see them in NYC tonight.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/charly-bliss-expand-tour-with-new-nyc-show/"><b>Charly Bliss, Samantha Urbani, Chloe MK @ Webster Hall</b></a><br/>Charly Bliss released their very good sophomore album <i><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/charly-bliss-share-chatroom-off-new-album-announce-tour/">Young Enough</a></i> earlier this year and play their biggest hometown show to date, with onetime Friends singer Samantha Urbani open.</p>
