      <p>Siddhant Chaturvedi says he has “emotionally made-out” with his Gully Boy co-star Ranveer Singh. “We had a different moment. He hugged me and I have cried, he has kissed me. It was a proper make-out session in the middle of the theatre. Yes, I have emotionally made-out with Ranveer Singh,” Siddhant said, recalling the time when their film was screened for the audience for the first time. <br/><br/><br/>Siddhant aka MC Sher, was all praise for his “intelligent and disciplined” co-star. “I remember watching Band Baaja Baaraat when I was in college. I’m looking at him and I am really inspired because he has just made it solely on his talent and his vision. We don’t see his intelligent side much. He’s just amazing,” he said. <br/><br/>Siddhant also pointed out that he has learnt a lot from Ranveer. “He aces every accent, every body language. That’s something that I learnt from him. I had a different voice, a different lingo in the film so I used to take notes from him. I was like how do you do it? He told me, ‘You keep recording on your voice memo whenever you are reading it out and you keep trying variations in that. And maintain consistency, bro,’” he added. <br/><br/><br/><b>► Disclaimer: This article has been produced as a part of a promotional feature</b></p>
