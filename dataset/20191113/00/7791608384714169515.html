      <p><b>No one would’ve</b> expected a unicorn cake for a five-year-old’s birthday party to be topped with a phallic object, but this seemed to be the case with the party held for Alexandra Schroeder’s daughter. <br/><b>The mother</b> of the birthday girl from Michigan decided to host a baking-themed party for her beloved daughter at Whipped Bakery. <br/><b>Unfortunately, what</b> was planned to be an innocent, PG-rated birthday party, turned out to be a nightmarish experience featuring a horn, which looked more like the male nether regions than a magical creature’s antler atop the unicorn birthday cake. <br/><b>The Michigan lady</b> shared with <i><a href="https://www.wilx.com/content/news/Local-woman-says-bakery-botched-her-cake-564539921.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">WILX 10</a></i> that the cake’s horn appeared to be in “a shape that was so embarrassing,” and that there were “finger prints on it.” Further, the topping was not even gold as she had requested the horn to be. <br/><b>She had asked</b> the bakery if she could see the cake before the guests arrived, but the business’s staff told her it “wasn’t finished.” <br/><b>This resulted in the</b> woman sharing her experience and the photo of the failed cake on her Facebook page, and in turn, retaliation from the bakery. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Whipped Bakery’s Facebook</b> page posted a statement declaring that Schroeder’s guests had left a mess, and that the woman still owes the company a remaining balance. <br/><b>The post, which</b> starts with, “How not to clean up after your birthday party,” has since been deleted. Schroeder argued that this was slander as she had already paid the bakery. <br/><b>As reported by</b> <i><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/unicorn-cake-fail-bad-ended-court-case-11070523/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Metro.co.uk</a></i>, the bakery later told members of the press that it would take the matter to court for further proceedings. <br/><b>All this drama</b> for a unicorn cake erected with a member as a horn. Take a look at the cake of a magical creature for yourself below.</p>
