        <b>The chairman of <i>Harmony</i> political party, Saeima deputy Jānis Urbanovičs promises to constantly control the party’s faction in Riga City Council. He wants certainty over the party’s ability to work.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Urbanovičs explains that the 13 November meeting with the city council faction was his initiative. «The most important thing I want to tell them is that I can no longer ignore the situation in Riga City Council and the party’s faction. I have to take care of all of them. I cannot afford to ignore Riga City Council,» says the politician.</p>
      <p>He stresses the faction in Riga City Council needs to learn to work and fulfil promises given to the capital city’s residents. «If they are elected with support from Riga’s residents in exchange for specific programmes, they have to fulfil their promises. If this is not the case, they cannot remain in the party. This applies to everyone – the ones who remain and the ones who have left. They have to answer how they intend to do this,’ says the parliamentarian.</p>
      <p>Urbanovičs stresses that it is important for Harmony’s faction to be able to continue working.</p>
      <h3>«I want to understand how they intend to fulfil promises they made to Riga’s residents. With me there, they will understand we intend to constantly exact control and observe how they do things,» says the politician.</h3>
      <p>Meeting with <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> political party is not among Urbanovičs’ list of priorities. Cooperation with <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i>, according to Urbanovičs, is a matter of tactics.</p>
      <p>«First of all, we have to look at who we can and cannot work with. The answer in regards to cooperation is based on what Harmony’s city council members can say about this situation. It is possible I am not aware of some factor. This is why I want to go and have a listen,» Urbanovičs said about the upcoming meeting.</p>

      <p>As previously reported, a joint meeting will be held between Riga City Council’s <i>Harmony</i> faction and the political party’s management to discuss the situation in the city council and the faction’s cooperation options with coalition partners.</p>
      <p><i>Harmony</i> is dissatisfied with its partner’s work and is currently in consideration of terminating relations with <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i>, stressing that <i>Harmony</i> does not find it acceptable to refuse fulfilling promises made to voters.</p>
      <p>On 2 November, Honour to Serve Riga urged partners to strengthen the coalition in Riga City Council, concerns about the stability of which are regularly voiced by political parties that are part of the coalition.</p>
      <p><i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> adopted a resolution «on enhancing teamwork». In it, the party invited «coalition partners from <i>Harmony</i> and <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>, as well as <i>For Riga</i> bloc to agree on possible mechanism to improve cooperation to work in the interest of the municipality’s residents».</p>
