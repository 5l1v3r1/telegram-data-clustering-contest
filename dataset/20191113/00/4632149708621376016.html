      <h1>From Delhi, with grille</h1>

      <p><i>Namma Metro plans to install barricades, like Delhi Metro has done in the national capital, in road medians to prevent littering, jaywalking</i> <br/><br/>In a bid to curb the menace of littering on Metro medians and to stop people and animals from destroying the ornamental plants on them, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited said it will install grilles to stop them from doing so. <br/><br/>As a pilot project, it has installed a 3-feet grille on the median near the Halasuru Metro Station. <br/><br/>The BMRCL has plans to install grilles on all the medians of the 24.10 km of North South corridor (Green Line) and the 18.2 km East West corridor (Purple Line), with 40 stations in all. An official said it would solve three problems— littering on the medians, animals like cows, dogs straying into them and defecating on them and the structures being used to cross the roads. <br/><br/>A senior BMRCL official said, “The decision to install grilles around the medians has been taken to prevent people from littering on them and animals from climbing on them. The animals destroy the plants that have been planted on them. Several pedestrians also use the medians to cross the road, which puts them at risk.” According to officials, the medians between metro pillars which are generally planted with ornamental plants have become a dumping ground for garbage.</p>

      <p>In Bengaluru, vendors have taken medians in many places</p>
      <p>“We have been trying to maintain these medians with ornamental plants but people have been dumping garbage on them,” said an official. <br/>Most of the installation work will happen at night so as not to obstruct traffic. <br/>To warn commuters, contractors have been instructed to install red lanterns or lights near barricades at night when the work is in progress. <br/><br/>The complete project might take up to nine months to finish and the total cost of on both the lines is Rs 9.6 crore approximately. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts said that instilling a basic sense of responsibility among commuters about the need to preserve public property rather than placing grilles on the medians is the need of the hour.</p>

      <p>–Senior BMRCL official<br/><br/>Urban expert V Ravichandar said, “It is very unfortunate that we don’t take pride in our assets. In Kochi Metro, there are no grilles on the medians and yet they are clean and well maintained. The only purpose the grilles will solve is stopping cows and commuters from climbing on them. Instead, we need to invest more money in bringing about a behavioural change. In countries outside India, there are laws for keeping roads and footpaths near one’s house clean. We need to penalise people and have zero tolerance for those who litter and destroy such assets.” <br/><br/>RK Misra, an urban expert, has vouched for constructing taller grilles so that people cannot jump over them. “I suggest that the authorities install grilles that are at least 6-feet high. This is a good initiative and if done properly, it will add to the aesthetic appeal of the Metro. It is an essential mobility infrastructure,” he said. <br/><br/><br/>In Delhi, too, there are grilles around the Metro medians.</p>
