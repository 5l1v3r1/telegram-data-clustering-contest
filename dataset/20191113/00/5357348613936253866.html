        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — British security officials said yesterday that an attempted cyber attack on the main Opposition Labour Party during general election campaigning had failed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) — part of Britain's spy agency GCHQ — said it was “confident the party took the necessary steps to deal with the attack”.</p>
      <p>Labour described the attack which took place on Monday as “large-scale”.</p>
      <p>“The Labour Party followed the correct, agreed procedures and notified us swiftly,” an NCSC spokeswoman said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The attack was not successful and the incident is now closed.”</p>
      <p>However, yesterday afternoon the main Labour party website ( <i>labour.org.uk</i>) was inaccessible.</p>
      <p>Instead, the website showed a message from a cybersecurity firm warning of a problem.</p>
      <p>The party did not have an immediate comment.</p>
      <p>It had earlier revealed that Monday's attempted hack had been repelled without an apparent data breach.</p>
      <p>“We have experienced a sophisticated and large-scale cyberattack on Labour digital platforms,” a party spokesman said.</p>
      <p>“These attempts failed due to our robust security systems. The integrity of all our platforms was maintained and we are confident that no data breach occurred,” he added.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn admitted he was worried about other potential attacks.</p>
      <p>In a speech on the campaign trail in Blackpool, north-west England, Corbyn said the incident was “very serious”, even if it had ultimately failed.</p>
      <p>“But if this is a sign to come in this election, I feel very nervous about it all,” he told supporters.</p>
      <p>“Because a cyberattack against a political party in an election is suspicious and something one is very worried about.”</p>
      <p>Some campaign activities were slowed but they were restored early yesterday and were now back to normal, according to the party.</p>
      <p>Labour confirmed it had promptly reported the attack to the NCSC, which monitors and works to protect security systems.</p>
      <p>The agency said it has been working closely with British political parties for several years “on how to protect and defend against cyber- attacks”, and had met the major parties last week ahead of the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>There is lingering concern in Britain about the potential for outside interference in the general election, with major parties increasingly relying on digital messaging.</p>
