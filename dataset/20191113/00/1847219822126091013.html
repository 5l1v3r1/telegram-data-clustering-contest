        <b>In the Netherlands, the government seeks to considerably reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxide by reducing daytime speed limit on roads from 130 to 100 km/h, leaked government plans to the press say.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British public broadcaster BBC reports that details of the leaked measures are to be revealed on Wednesday, November 13, but reports say the existing limit of up to 130km/h would still be permitted at night from 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why is it needed?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dutch nitrogen oxide pollution crisis is so severe that big infrastructure projects have been put on hold. A ruling in May by the top court in the Netherlands on nitrogen oxide emissions affected thousands of plans for roads, housing and airports.</p>
      <p>The Council of State said Dutch rules for granting building and farming permits breached EU law protecting nature from emissions such as ammonia and nitrous oxide.</p>
      <p>The government wants to build 75,000 homes in 2020, so for the past week the cabinet has tried to find a solution to cutting the pollutants.</p>
