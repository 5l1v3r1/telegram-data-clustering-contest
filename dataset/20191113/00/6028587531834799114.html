      <h1>Why WeWork Was Top Tick Of Global Economic Bubble</h1>

      <p>Posterity will remember WeWork for many things. Messianic tech founders run amok, the risks of Silicon Valley’s fake-it-till-you-make-it mindset, financiers with more money than brains, you name it. Yet the office-sharing startup’s most important role may be as the top tick of the latest global asset bubble. The only remaining question is which kind? More to the point, whether the mania of which WeWork is emblematic has more in common with America’s 2000 tech crash or Japan’s a decade earlier.</p>
      <p>The difference matters. The former suggests a short-term cyclical reckoning that reminds investors to put profits over hype; the latter a more secular downshift in global economic growth. Which is it? The WeWork debacle seems a financial amalgam of both episodes, and in ways that auger poorly for 2020. “Debacle” is the right characterization.</p>
      <p>Even if Masayoshi Son is furiously trying to save WeWork, it’s already a zombie unicorn. His desire to save face for drinking co-founder Adam Neumann’s Kool-Aid doesn’t change the fact WeWork’s business model is a dud. Ditto for JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon who shares the dubious honor of being a top Neumann enabler. Yet Son’s role here thickens the plot. His status as the globe’s most impactful venture capitalist has its roots in Japan’s own reckoning.</p>
      <p>Decades of credit-fueled Japanese growth hit a wall around 1990. The crash began in December 1989 when the Bank of Japan hit the monetary brakes. The shockwaves catalyzed one of history’s most ferocious margin calls as property investors that used stocks as collateral all ran for the exits at once. In late 1989, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average hit a high of 38,915. By August 1992, it had more than halved to 14,309. The fallout led to the “lost decade” that was the 1990s. Deflation took hold, prompting the BOJ to cut interest rates to zero by 1999. And driving Japan’s top CEOs to look outside the nation for growth opportunities.</p>
      <p>In 2000, Son, then 43, showed Japan Inc. how it’s done. That was the year he bet $20 million on the vision of an obscure English teacher in Hangzhou, China. When Jack Ma took Alibaba public in 2014, Son’s stake was worth $50 billion — and growing.</p>
      <p>That coup earned Son a “Warren Buffett of Japan” halo. It also would inform the telecom billionaire’s eventual role as VC whale. The $100 billion pool investment juggernaut he unleaded in 2017 was, for obvious reasons, called Vision Fund. Yet things have gotten mighty blurry. Just as a homerun in 2000 made his reputation, his WeWork strikeout set Son’s current reckoning in motion. This swing-and-a-miss hurt so much because it laid bare a strategy that long worried peers. Those peers have two main gripes about Son’s strategy.</p>
      <p>One, how he lavishes billions on untested entrepreneurs everywhere. Two, how Vision Fund seemed to be trying to create new monopolies across sectors. In August 2018, Son anointed WeWork the “next Alibaba” as his Vision Fund threw ever more billions at Neumann’s house of cards. For all Neumann’s spin about digital-age betterment and innovative community building, WeWork is an office-space sub-leaser spending big to make properties it doesn’t own hip. It still needs to make the rent in the globe’s priciest cities — month after month after month.</p>
      <p>Neumann also believed his own press. WeWork’s initial public offering literature was a study in red flags — rampant overspending, a CEO hiring family members, opaque management structures, hubris that would make the founders of Pets.com circa 1999 blush. WeWork’s IPO has since been shelved and Neumann sent packing, similar to Travis Kalanick’s expulsion from Uber (and with a $1.7 billion golden parachute already spawning lawsuits).</p>
      <p>The episode raises urgent questions about Son’s rather investment style. His outsized bet on WeWork isn’t the only one going awry. Son’s sizable stakes in Uber, Lyft, Slack and other startups contributed to Vision Fund’s $8.9 billion loss in the July-September period (and a $6.4 billion loss for SoftBank Group). Son’s comeuppance has Asia bracing for a new “tech winter” as SoftBank closes its wallet. Or at the very least, Son begins scrutinizing business models in ways the VC crowd did after the 2000 Nasdaq crash.</p>
      <p>That has startups from South Korea to Indonesia prioritizing profitability over the growth-at-all-costs ethos that’s been ruling techdom. Yet this moment could say even more about the trajectory of the global economy. Notice that the Vision Fund’s stumble isn’t taking broader equities markets along with it. Not even the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is up 27% this year. The reason: central banks continue to churn tidal waves of liquidity into markets. Walls of cash are pouring out of Washington, Tokyo, Frankfurt and elsewhere and chasing fewer and fewer good investments. Put these stark realities together with a global trade war and you have all the makings of “irrational exuberance.”</p>
      <p>The International Monetary Fund forecasts 3% growth this year, which means a “synchronized slowdown” everywhere. China is growing at its weakest pact since 1992, Japan and Korea are skirting recession and the Brexit fiasco is weighing on European demand. While the U.S. remains a bright spot, the 1.9% growth recorded in the third quarter is a far cry from the 5% or 6% that President Donald Trump promised. Central bank liquidity has asset prices decoupling from economic fundamentals, often starkly.</p>
      <p>Odds are, markets will return to earth as warning signs flash ever more brightly. At which point a critical mass of investors is likely to realize markets are running on fumes. And from there, punters will realize that global asset markets are set for something approaching a secular downtrend. Not a Japan-like deflationary dive, perhaps, but a prolonged period of tepid growth, slowing demand and moderating consumer prices. Why? Well, the globe is overdue for one. All of the major growth engines are running out of gas.</p>
      <p>And equally important, those powers are effectively out of tools to keep growth aloft. Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut and three Federal Reserve rate cuts this year leave Washington few options. European Central Bank rates are already zero. The same with the Bank of Japan and a government debt burden more than twice the size of the economy. China faces a diminishing returns problem. After years of excessive credit creation and public works spending, stimulus efforts tend to lose potency.</p>
      <p>Once the bubble that WeWork exemplifies bursts, governments have few options to revive growth. When the subprime crisis felled the global economy in 2008, policymakers had fiscal and monetary space to respond. This time, ammunition is in short supply. That doesn’t mean everyone will turn Japanese. It does, however, suggest that the slowdown resulting from the next reckoning will be more secular than cyclical. That’s an outcome with will work for no one but tech-stock shortsellers.</p>
