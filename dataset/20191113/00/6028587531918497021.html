      <p>WWE Raw’s most polarizing storyline, a sexually charged love triangle between Lana, Rusev and Bobby Lashley, appeared to bottom out this past Monday depending on whom you ask. As Lana once again accused Rusev of being a sex addict before faking a pregnancy to lure him into an ambush, fans in attendance at the SNHU Arena in Manchester reportedly drowned out the segment with boos as it was roundly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/08/fans-reject-rusev-lana-sex-addict-storyline-mock-wwe-raw-segment-as-worst-of-2019/#198ad33b48f4">panned as the worst segment of 2019.</a> With this adulterous trainwreck drawing most of the buzz for a pre-taped show, WWE Raw viewership averaged just 2.058 million viewers, the <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/this-week-taped-wwe-raw-episode-draws-lowest-viewership-in-662093/">lowest non-holiday viewership in modern history.</a></p>
      <p>Up against the highest-rated <i>Monday Night Football </i>game of the season, Raw’s overseas broadcast lost around 300,000 viewers per hour. Raw also featured the largest first-to-third hour drop in Raw history, not to mention the lowest third-hour viewership ever.</p>
      <p>If there is any silver lining for a storyline that has been an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/10/30/wwe-raw-sees-17-drop-in-third-hour-for-sexually-charged-divorce-court/">anchor of Raw’s ratings nosedive</a>, it’s the angle’s predictable success on YouTube. Lana’s fake pregnancy announcement currently has over two million views on YouTube just two days after being posted, easily the most-viewed segment of any Raw clip from this week. In fact, the six weeks of YouTube videos centered around this controversial sex storyline have amassed almost 20 million views, with only one video—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpXL3MHEz7Q">Rusev’s decidedly non-sexual challenge to Bobby Lashley</a>—coming under one million views.</p>
      <p>Wrestling fans <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/01/16/sex-sells-as-half-naked-alexa-bliss-mandy-rose-rack-up-millions-of-wwe-youtube-views/#5ecd9fed12ca">flock to sexually suggestive videos</a> like fireflies to a funhouse. Whether it was the 7.5 million fans who watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXyt25AES0">Alexa Bliss’ dressing room snafu</a>, the 4.2 million fans who watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ6sgsmB5EA">scantily clad Mandy Rose in a hotel room</a> or even the 41 million (!) fans who watched Eva Marie’s wardrobe malfunction in one of the highest-viewed WWE YouTube clips in history. In fact, Eva Marie’s (kayfabe) wardrobe malfunction amassed more viewers than both clips of Brock Lesnar’s matches against Goldberg—at Survivor Series that same year and WrestleMania 33—combined.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, YouTube views mean very little to WWE’s bottom line as the promotion has historically struggled to efficiently monetize its overwhelming popularity on social media. In 2016, the final year that digital media earnings were itemized, Ian Frisch of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qky387/breaking-kayfabe-an-inside-look-at-wwes-unlikely-business-empire">Vice</a> noted WWE only made three cents per online user outside of the WWE Network compared to $21 per domestic cable viewer.</p>
      <p>Rusev has done his best to <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/rusev-says-bobby-lashley-lana-storyline-is-wwe-best-662074/">toe the company line</a>, insisting this angle has been the “best storyline currently going on.” But this soap opera for an audience of aging males will hardly translate to a money-drawing spectacle for a promotion that has had few to speak of since John Cena left for Hollywood.</p>
