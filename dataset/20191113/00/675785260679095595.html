      <p>A woman has been left with PTSD after a man threw a bucket of hot diarrhoea over her head.</p>
      <p>Heidi Van Tassel was about to head home following a Thai dinner near the Hollywood Walk of Fame when a rough sleeper dragged her out of her car.</p>
      <p>He pulled her into the middle of the street and dumped the bucket of faeces over her head, the victim claimed.</p>
      <p>“It was diarrhoea. Hot liquid,” Ms Van Tassel told <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/diarrhea-poured-on-woman-hollywood-homeless-564585101.html">NBC4</a> .</p>
      <p>“I was soaked, and it was coming off my eyelashes and into my eyes.</p>

      <p>"It was all inside my car because it was so much. He just kept pouring it and splattering it all over me."</p>
      <p>Describing the amount of poo thrown at the woman, a paramedic who treated her said it 'looked like the man was saving it up for a month'.</p>
      <p>Ms Van Tassel added: "It’s so traumatic. The PTSD that I’m dealing with is beyond anything that I’ve ever felt. There needs to be some kind of help for the victims of these crimes.</p>
      <p>"If he would’ve had a knife, for sure he would’ve stabbed me."</p>

      <p>She was rushed to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital and tested for infectious diseases linked to contact with poo.</p>
      <p>The victim will have to undergo further checks every three months.</p>
      <p>The homeless man, who suffers from mental illness, was arrested and jailed.</p>
      <p>The rough sleeper was sent to a mental health home and released in August.</p>
      <p>Ms Van Tassel disapproved of his sentence and is now worried about him committing another offence.</p>
