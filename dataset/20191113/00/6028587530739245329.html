      <p>This could be a historic year for female-led companies that have achieved $1 billion valuations. The education software startup Guild Education announced today the close of its $157 million Series D round, making it one of the few female-led companies to join the elusive unicorn club this year.The funding round was led by former American Express CEO Ken Chenault through the venture firm General Catalyst, and was joined by Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective, Iconiq Capital and Lead Edge Capital.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2015 by Stanford University graduates Brittany Stich and Rachel Carlson, Guild connects employers to online programs offered by nearly a dozen universities—among them, Purdue Global, Southern New Hampshire University and the University of Central Florida. Some of the partner employers include Chipotle, Walmart, Lowe’s and the Walt Disney Co.</p>
      <p>Guild works with employers to offer education as a company benefit to those employees who don’t yet have an advanced degree. Employees gain access to various education programs, including trade diplomas, certificates, high school completion programs, bachelor’s and master’s degrees. About 400,000 working adults have used Guild’s program to date. </p>
      <p>Based in Denver, Guild is one of only three female-led companies on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#73adc6b05f94">2019 Forbes Cloud 100 list</a>. Its latest funding round is more than double the $71.5 million previously raised by the company, allowing it to join a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/female-founded-unicorns-are-being-born-at-an-unprecedented-rate-in-2019-data-shows/">2019 unicorn cohort</a> that includes Rent the Runway, Glossier and FabFitFun.</p>
      <p>In the past, hitting the $1 billion valuation mark was seen as an almost unattainable goal for female-led startups, but the milestone has become increasingly common. In 2018, a total of 12 female-founded startups became unicorns, as compared with a mere 6 in 2017.</p>
      <p>But that’s not to say that progress hasn’t been slow or that there isn’t considerable room for growth: The 10 unicorns founded by women in 2018 were just a small subset of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/the-crunchbase-unicorn-leaderboard-is-back-now-with-a-record-herd-of-452-unicorns/">151  unicorns</a> founded that year, representing just 6.6% of the total. And thus far in 2019, a whopping 88.8% of all venture capital deals have gone to companies <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/11/12/the-number-of-venture-capital-backed-companies-with-female-founders-is-on-the-rise/#35d43363bc36">led by a male CEO</a>.</p>
