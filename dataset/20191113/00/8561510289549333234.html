      <h1>Professor Claims Internet Access Should Be a Human Right</h1>

      <h3>Basic Human Right</h3>
      <p>It’s easy to take access to uncensored internet for granted.</p>
      <p>Now, academics are arguing that internet access should be a basic human right. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/japp.12395?referrer_access_token=rKXTXNNdhi1tJO3W7NGorYta6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC65w4YkEDJAR5hXhp-cP14JmXoS8Pup6U-s0u0IA9VHS5h3nEkHzECdHuMt8VQdkYLNxV6RH50nYe_dn88txoaAPgSM8lrTpB-ZAMZsVowJ4NA%3D%3D">new study</a> published this week in the <i>Journal of Applied Philosophy</i>, University of Birmingham ethicist Merten Reglitz makes the case that the internet is “necessary to enable the realisation of human rights and the promotion of democracy.”</p>
      <h3>No Access</h3>
      <p>Reglitz isn’t the first to suggest something similar. The Human Rights Council of the United Nations <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7">declared</a> internet access a basic human right back in 2016, though according to the latest estimates <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet#internet-access">almost half</a> of the global population has zero access to the web.</p>
      <p>Even worse, many countries around the world have opted to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/editor-chinese-paper-complains-censorship-censored">censor information</a> online, and in some rare instances <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/governments-censorship-shutting-off-internet">shut down</a> access entirely during political unrest. And that’s inherently a human rights violation — or at least could enable governments to hide other human rights violations, according to Reglitz.</p>
      <h3>Turning Tide</h3>
      <p>Reglitz concludes that internet “is not merely a luxury for those who can afford it but instead is necessary for individuals to lead minimally decent lives.” His argument: basic freedoms including the freedom of expression, information, and assembly are inherently undermined if not everybody has access.</p>
      <p>Luckily, Reglitz’s opinion won’t fall on deaf ears. Several initiatives — including SpaceX’s <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/watch-spacex-launch-60-starlink-satellites">Starlink</a> satellite internet initiative — are trying to bring internet to those who aren’t currently able to access it.</p>
