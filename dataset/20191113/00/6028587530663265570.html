      <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9614440/"><i>Mickey and the Bear</i></a> is not only actress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Morrone">Camila Morrone’s</a> first turn on film as a leading lady but also the first feature film of director and writer <a href="http://iloveannabelle.com/">Annabelle Attanasio</a>. Set in rural Anaconda, Montana, the film tells the coming-of-age story of Mickey, a young woman who struggles to decide whether to pursue a future for herself or play caregiver to her volatile father Hank (a masterful performance by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0197647/bio">James Badge Dale</a>). Mickey’s mother passed away from cancer, and Mickey, in many ways, becomes Hank’s parent, bailing him out of trouble and doling out his pain pills. The film tackles America’s opioid crisis, as well as the lack of resources offered to veterans who suffer from PTSD. The film explores grief, the tenderness and complications of a damaged father-daughter relationship.Morrone is no stranger to the film industry. She grew up in Hollywood as the daughter of Argentine actors Lucila Solá and Maximo Morrone and in the past has <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/late-late-show/video/UTMuS24_ZFerGIiLIAri0tDAtUzQQc2J/camila-morrone-went-to-the-al-pacino-school-of-acting/">sought out acting advice</a> from her stepfather Al Pacino. Morrone brings grit and a quiet strength to Mickey. It is a breakout performance for the young actress that will hopefully lead to many more opportunities to shine.</p>
      <p>I spoke to Morrone about the unusual way she booked the role of Mickey. We also discussed her parents’ reaction to the film and the experience of filming in Montana.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Risa Sarachan: What stood out to you about this script?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Camila Morrone: </b>I read a lot of scripts, but few of them stand out to me. So for me, it was that when I read the script, I didn’t even get through it, and I was like, “this is something I want to do.” I could just tell it had the elements of characters that I’m interested in playing. So I was already instantly drawn to it. Once I did the audition and got to meet Annabelle, we talked about what her vision was, and I looked at some mood board pictures and photography that she had taken in Montana because she had spent some time in Anaconda before me. So, I got the aesthetic of what the film was going to look like and feel like, and then I was totally hooked and in.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>Had you been to Montana before?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>I hadn’t been to Montana, and I haven’t been anywhere like that. I fell in love with Montana, and hopefully, I am going to go back soon for vacation, but I got to explore on the weekends and take little road trips because everything was so beautiful there.</p>

      <p><b>Sarachan:</b> It sounds like Annabelle used a lot of local hires for the film.</p>
      <p><b>Morrone:</b> Yeah, I think there were five actors total that were brought in, and everyone was local. Having a film be able to bring that to a small town like Anaconda, you know, for these people that aren’t in the industry, it’s a very big deal and very new to them. Some people would get nervous on set, the other ones would overact, and then some of them were just great. It was cool to provide that opportunity and excitement for everyone in a town that doesn’t see this kind of thing a lot.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>You grew up an only child to younger parents. Do you feel that those relationships informed you as you were building this relationship between Mickey and Hank?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>Both my parents moved here from Argentina before I was born, so they were in a foreign country. My mom was only 21 years old when she had me, and my dad was in his mid-20s. So it was a very unique situation; they just moved here on a whim without family, so it definitely felt like the three of us were navigating through this. My mom was really young so we had the opportunity to be really close and go through things together. So, I leaned into that in terms of the closeness of Mickey and Hank’s relationship, which I felt came really naturally to me because of my proximity to my parents. But of course, with any relationship, there are problems, and that’s what you see. Obviously, Mickey and Hank’s is more extreme than what it’s supposed to be, and ultimately it turns quite volatile, but at the core of it, at the beginning of the movie is the love that they have for each other. And that’s the thing that holds her from ultimately making her life decision.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>How did you and James Badge Dale build that intimacy?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>We only got five days to rehearse before the film, which, it’s lucky that we even got that because it’s a small budget film. So, I was really excited that we got that time. But Badge and I, I think, just had a natural chemistry. I think he’s a really easy actor to work with, which helps because he just leads you in. We didn’t really go through the scenes fully while rehearsing it; we wanted to save that and surprise each other on the day. But instantly, when I met Badge, I was like, “oh ok, I have a good support here.” That’s ultimately what he ended up being was a great support throughout the film.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>The struggle that Mickey goes through in terms of wanting to be supportive of her best friend and her only family, the pull to family, and the pull towards freedom is very relatable. How did you explore that beforehand, or did it crystalize during filming?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>I think Hank did such a good job of never being a monster and also not being the best. So he wasn’t always one or the other. He’d be awful, and the audience is cringing, and then he’d do something sweet like giving Mickey the knife and telling Mickey that he loves her in his own way. So I think it was, that was a lot on James Badge Dales part. He found a really great balance. I think that growing up teenagers just experience that. You start to think, “what is life going to look like when I turn eighteen?” And you dream and think about the things that you want to do and also have your loyalty to your family because they gave you everything and provided for you. So I think it’s a very normal teenage complexity that comes in around Mickey’s age.</p>

      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>This was Annabelle Attanasio’s feature directorial debut. What was the experience like starring in her first big project?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>It’s crazy, she’s 25 years old. She wrote this film throughout her early twenties in college, and after graduating, she got this film financed and directed it. She was so organized; we were on time with everything. Running a shoot is very difficult; even people who have been doing this for fifty years, they go over budget, and things get complicated. She just was so confident it was almost scary. I was like, “how are you this confident?”</p>
      <p>She had spent so many years imagining what this film w0uld look like and she had all the work done before, so when the day came she was just able to be a director and not worry about the details and really be there for the actors and be like, “ok, let’s improvise! What don’t you like? What isn’t working? Let’s add this.” Which is a really cool thing to have for a director. And we’re all really young. Fifty percent of our crew was under 30 years old, and they’d all just graduated. It was like all of our feature film, I mean, it was my first lead in a film where I’m kind of in every shot of the movie. It’s definitely a unique experience.</p>

      <p><b>Sarachan:</b> You booked this film off of a self-tape?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>Yes, actually, my last two movies were self-tapes. I always do these self-tapes, and it’s interesting. You know, my parents were actors, and they were like, “you’re never going to get self-tapes, you have to go in in-person.” Now the way the industry is, I think something like 65-70% of my auditions are all self-tapes. I always think I’m not going to get it; I don’t have direction from the casting director and the producers to help guide me-and then the last two things I got were self-tapes. So actually 75% of what I’ve booked so far, my career is basically based on self-tapes now. [Laughs.]</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan: </b>Have your parents seen the film yet?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>Oh yeah, my mom has seen it like four times. [Laughs.] It’s funny; my dad saw it the first time, and he was like, “that was cool.” And then he saw it a couple of months later when it was really done, and all the music and the coloring and the editing was done, and he walked out of the theatre, and he was crying. That was a very big moment for me to see the stamp of approval from my dad.</p>
      <p><b>Sarachan: </b><i>Mickey and the Bear</i> touches on the opioid crisis and issues facing veterans today. What did you come away with post-filming about these problems in our country?</p>
      <p><b>Morrone: </b>To be honest, I didn’t know much about the veteran situation in America before this film. This really did open my eyes on the subject, and we got to go to a VA and shoot there, as you see in the movie with Dr. Watkins. I thought this was an interesting way to take on the veteran crisis. It shows the veteran who has gone through war but also the way that PTSD affects families. The way it affects children and spouses, as well. That’s the story Annabelle really wanted to tell, was a story of, what does that look like when you get home and start to crumble, and how does that affect the people closest to you? You see Hank doesn’t have friends, he lost his wife, Mickey is the only person he really has, and it turns into this really unhealthy dynamic. I thought this was a different way to shed light on that than I’d seen before.</p>
