      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - The Alaska Department of Transportation is considering how to act on a study addressing issues within the Alaska Marine Highway System including an aging fleet and decreased ridership.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alaska-journal/">Alaska Journal</a> of Commerce reported Wednesday that the study conducted over spring and summer by a private firm evaluated 11 options for overhauling the network of vessels.</p>
      <p>The system’s budget has been cut in half since its peak of $111.2 million in fiscal year 2012 and service levels have been cut about 25% over that time.</p>
      <p>Officials say ridership has declined from about 350,000 ferry passengers in 1998 to 251,000 passengers in 2018.</p>
      <p>Officials say 10 of the state’s 12 ferries average 37 years old and six ferries are more than 40 years old. Two ferries are docked and awaiting sale.</p>
