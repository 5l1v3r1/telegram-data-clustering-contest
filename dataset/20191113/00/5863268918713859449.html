      <h1>Nawaz’ removal from ECL: Cabinet subcommittee to announce its decision today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:25:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:25</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The subcommittee of the cabinet will send its recommendations to cabinet in a matter pertaining to removal of Nawaz Sharif’s name from ECL.</p>
      <p>Third meeting of the subcommittee was held to discuss the matter and it will announce its decisions on Wednesday 10 AM.</p>
      <p>Sources said PML-N has refused to submit surety bonds. The committee has saved its decision however it has given time to PML-N and NAB to submit their final answer today (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>PML-N s Atta Tarar said we have already submitted surity bonds to the court and there is no need to submit security now to the subcommittee.</p>
      <p>Special Assistant to PM on Accountability Shehzad Akbar earlier told media that they have asked Sharif family to give them a date of return. He said courts also ask for surety bonds.</p>
      <p>The cabinet s sub-committee decided that Nawaz Sharif will have to submit a surety amount equal to the penalty imposed on him in Al-Azizia Reference.</p>
      <p>It is pertinent here to mention that two meetings of the subcommittee ended without any decision.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said the government itself should look into the matter of excluding Nawaz Sharif’s name from the ECL. The anti-graft watchdog had returned the matter to the interior ministry after it sent the PML-N supreme leader’s medical reports to the NAB.</p>
      <p>Nawaz Sharif was scheduled to travel UK on Qatar Airways flight QR629 yesterday. However, his ticket had been canceled as the authorities did not remove his name from the ECL.</p>
