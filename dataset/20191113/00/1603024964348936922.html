      <h1>BJP dig: Up to Shiv Sena to fit 'Hindutva' agenda in CMP with Congress</h1>

      <p>The BJP on November 13 appeared needling its ally-turned-political rival Shiv Sena, which is trying to stitch up a coalition government in Maharashtra with ideologically incompatible Congress and NCP, on "Hindutva".</p>
      <p>The Sena is holding deliberations with the Congress and the NCP to rope them in to form a government in the state, which came under President's Rule on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>"It is up to the Shiv Sena how to fit their 'Hindutva' agenda in the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) with the Congress," senior BJP leader and Union minister Raosaheb Danve said.</p>

      <p>"The Congress, which is a 150-year-old party, will obviously take its agenda further (in government)," he told a news channel.</p>
      <p>The Sena often projects itself as a party that propagates Hindutva, which remains an ideological glue between the Uddhav Thackeray-led party and the BJP.</p>
      <p>Thackeray on Tuesday night said the Sena needed a clarity on the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) just like the Congress and the NCP if a government is to be formed with their support.</p>
      <p>Danve also defended Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari's decision to not grant additional time to the Sena on Monday night for securing letters of support for staking a claim to form government. The Sena had moved the supreme court against the governor's decision.</p>
      <p>"It is not good to move objection against the governor. He only used his Constitutional right," he said.</p>
      <p>Since the President's Rule is in force, the Sena now has enough time to stake claim to form government, he added.</p>
      <p>"If the Sena has numbers they can stake a claim anytime," he said.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on his party's strategy, Danve said the people's mandate should be respected. "If that doesn't happen in Maharashtra, we will sit in opposition," he added.</p>
      <p>The BJP had blamed the Sena for "insulting" the people's mandate, which it said led to imposition of President's Rule.</p>
      <p>The Central Rule was imposed 19 days after the fractured mandate in the state assembly polls failed to elect a clear winner.</p>
      <p>The BJP, which won maximum 105 seats in the 288-member House, declined to stake the claim to form government, as its alliance partner Shiv Sena (56) refused to lend support.</p>
      <p>The third largest party NCP (54) too couldn't muster requisite numbers. Its ally Congress has 44 members.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
