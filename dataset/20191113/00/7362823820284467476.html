      <h1>Saudi Arabia security video lists feminism, atheism, homosexuality as forms of extremism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:42:25+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:42</time> by <a rel="author">Bradford Betz</a></address>
      <p>A video posted on the Twitter account of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia’s</a> state security agency lists feminism, homosexuality and atheism as "forms of extremism."</p>
      <p>The video, posted over the weekend by a verified account of the State Security Presidency and cited by <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20191111183240-ipalt">Reuters</a>, says “all forms of extremism and perversion are unacceptable.”</p>

      <p>"Don’t forget that excess of anything at the expense of the homeland is considered extremism,” says a voiceover in the video.</p>
      <p>Per Saudi law, homosexuality and atheism are punishable by death; support for so-called extremist groups can lead to imprisonment, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>The security agency’s post seemed at odds with the kingdom’s recent efforts to attract investment.</p>
      <p>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has publicly advocated for a less militant brand of Islam, while Riyadh has also loosened its guardianship system, in which women are assigned a male relative to accompany them and approve their decisions.</p>

      <p>“The Saudi state security agency’s announcement which labels feminism, atheism and homosexuality as extremist ideas punishable by jail and flogging is outrageous – clearly contracting the Kingdom’s bogus reformist image which Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman continues to flaunt internationally,” he said.</p>
