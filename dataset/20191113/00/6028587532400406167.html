      <h1>Capgemini Report: Only 14% of Smart Factory Deployments So Far Are Considered Successful</h1>

      <p>As any manufacturer knows, the shift to smart factories and digital manufacturing is essential but not easy. This conclusion is born out by the latest <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/news/smart-factories-at-scale/">Capgemini survey of 912 manufacturers </a>about their experiences with smart factories. The positive conclusions from the survey and the accompanying research report got a lot of play in media such as CNBC, which ran a headline that said “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/smart-factories-could-contribute-2point2-trillion-to-global-economy.html">Smart factories could contribute as much as $2.2 trillion to the global economy, report says</a>.” True, that number is in the report (though as we see down below, it doesn’t quite mean what it appears to mean). But beneath the headline, the report is full of much more interesting data about the ongoing shift to digital manufacturing.</p>

      <p>First, the report notes that only 14% of organizations with smart factory initiatives say “they would characterize their smart factory deployments so far as a success.” That’s not a resounding vote of confidence. Indeed, nearly 60% say their initiatives are “either struggling or that it is too early to comment.“</p>
      <p>In addition, the actual gains from smart factory initiatives are much lower than targeted, according to the respondents to the Capgemini survey. For example, the target productivity improvement from “efficiency by design” was 34%. But the actual “achieved” productivity improvement was only 12%. Similarly, market share gains have fallen well short of expectations.</p>
      <p>These pessimistic results are consistent with global data on manufacturing productivity, which does not show an acceleration. Based on the first three quarters of 2019, manufacturing productivity growth in the United States actually slowed to only 0.3% in 2019, down from 0.7% in 2018 and 1.2% in 2017. That’s based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
      <p>In Germany, the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2019/11/PE19_429_421.html">index of production in manufacturing</a> fell by 3.9% from August 2018 to August 2019, according to German government statisticians. Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2019/10/PE19_403_421.html">number of hours worked in manufacturing</a> fell by 3.7% over the same period, suggesting a small dip in productivity.</p>
      <p>These short-term productivity results don’t prove the absence of gains from smart factories. Productivity data is often heavily revised, and is best measured over longer periods.</p>
      <p>It is perhaps instructive, however, that Capgemini has not modified its own projections of manufacturing growth. The report observes that “the manufacturing industry in the geographies we have surveyed has grown at a pace of 2.8% annually between 2007 and 2017, and we estimate that it will continue to do so for the next five years.” That’s not a sign that Capgemini expects a dramatic acceleration of output from smart factories.</p>
      <p>Instead, the study noted that the extra productivity gains from smart factories would “remain as capacity gain or spare capacity for future growth in average and aggressive scenarios, respectively.” In an important sense, Capgemini is projecting additions to potential GDP growth rather than actual GDP growth.</p>
      <p>The implication is that we are at the early stages of digitization of manufacturing. The good news from the Capgemini study is that despite their poor experience thus far, manufacturers understand the importance of smart factories and digitization to their future. Average annual spending on smart factories is expected to rise from 1.9% of revenues over the last three years to 3.2% of revenue over the next three years. That’s a huge increase, and suggests that we will soon be seeing productivity gains from digital manufacturing.</p>
      <p>The big winners, in my opinion, will be those manufacturers who are able to integrate smart factories with digitized logistics, organization, and design (the four layers of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelmandel1/2019/08/20/building-the-new-manufacturing-stack/#208c6ad6561f">new manufacturing stack</a> which I discussed in earlier columns). This is more sophisticated than simply installing a system from a vendor. It requires a complete rethinking of business practices and perhaps even basic business models.</p>
      <p>The Capgemini study does an excellent job in discussing the challenges facing a manufacturer who wants to truly get the full benefits out of smart factories initiatives. I strongly recommend reading the Capgemini smart factory report for its cogent advice to manufacturers on how to move forward. Hint: just don’t pay too much attention to the headline macro number.</p>
