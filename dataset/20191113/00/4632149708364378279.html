      <h1>Channasandra Road residents are fed up</h1>

      <p><i>The BBMP has been unresponsive to their issues, which include garbage, poor drainage system and roads filled with potholes</i> <br/><br/>The residents of Channasandra Road are forced to bear the brunt of poor drainage and ignored maintenance. The road that connects Kothanur, Rampura and Old Airport Road is riddled with potholes, garbage and unfinished asphalting. Moreover, the rampant sewage dumping in Rampura Lake causes a stench and has also become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. <br/><br/>“The roads in the area are pathetic, which causes heavy traffic. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) pipelines have been damaged and the open drains directly flow into the lake, contaminating the water. The area near the lake becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes after 4pm and it becomes unbearable to reside nearby,” said a resident. <br/><br/>Animal waste, construction debris and garbage has contaminated the lake. Parking is another issue as commuters park their vehicles carelessly anywhere on the road and even on the footpath. The residents have lodged several complaints with the authorities but no action has been taken yet. <br/><br/>Mithun Murlidhar, a daily commuter on the Channasandra Road, tried to grab the attention of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) several times but in vain. He started writing to Jagannath Rao, BBMP’s deputy conservator of forests, lakes and other officials regarding the issue. When there was no proper response from the Palike’s end, he signed a petition along with several others. But that failed as well. Recently, he protested near Rampura Lake after which BBMP promised to repair all the roads and drainage system within a month. However, they are yet to take an action. “I’m going to keep writing letters to the authorities until they start working,” Mithun told Bangalore Mirror. <br/><br/>Another resident complained that he does not receive tenants in his apartment. “I’m facing losses due to the poor sanitation and pollution in the area. No one wants to live here,” he said. <br/><br/>Residents also complain that their vehicles are getting damaged after continuous commutes on this road. The road humps and potholes are not visible at night and have been the cause of several accidents. The road is mostly used by school children and people going to offices. According to a resident, there is no unity among them and they need to confront the authorities as a united front, in large numbers to show the number of people affected by this.</p>
