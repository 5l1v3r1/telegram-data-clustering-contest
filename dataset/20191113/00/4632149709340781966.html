      <p><i>Candidates who did not pass official medical test get benefit from HC order</i> <br/><br/>Some candidates who failed in the medical test at the time of joining duty in the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) got the benefit of the High Court order which allowed them another test. An earlier division bench order of the Delhi High Court, which had allowed a similar case, came to their rescue. <br/><br/>There were two petitions before the HC with candidates placed in similar conditions. “The petitioners in both the petitions were selected for the post of Constable/GD in the respondent-Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). The medical fitness test was conducted at the time of selection as well as the time of joining duty. When the petitioners were put to medical test at the time of joining duty, they were found medically unfit on specific deformity. It is in this background that these petitions were filed,” the HC noted. <br/><br/>The HC had allowed these candidates to undertake another medical test through the Medical Board at Victoria Hospital in the city. The process was ,however ,hampered by a mistake. “The Medical Board forwarded its reports to this Court in a sealed cover. On 04.07.2019 this Court opened the sealed cover and pursued the medical report submitted by the Medical Board. However, it was found that the medical report was not with respect to the particular deformity pointed out by the respondents. Therefore, the petitioners were once agin directed to appear before the Medical Board.” <br/><br/>The candidates appeared before the Medical Board once agian and submitted its report to the HC once agian in a sealed cover. “By order dated 03.09.2019 the sealed cover was opened and the registry was directed to furnish a copy of the report to the learned counsels on both the sides,” the court noted. The HC took note of a case in the Delhi High Court where under similar circumstances the candidates were directed to undergo re-examination by the Medical Board.</p>
