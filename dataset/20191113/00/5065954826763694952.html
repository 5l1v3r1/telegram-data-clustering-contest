      <p>AS the holiday season nears, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) must be wary of mall operators who refuse to give their employees overtime pay, according to a labor group.</p>
      <p>Partido Manggagawa (PM) Chairman Renato Magtubo issued the reminder to the DOLE on Tuesday as malls started extending their operating hours to accommodate more clients.</p>
      <p>Some mall operators, Magtubo noted, have opened their establishments for a longer period of time, sometimes up to 12 hours, from the usual eight hours.</p>
      <p>The longer working hours will entitle concerned mall workers additional benefits like overtime pay and night differential pay.</p>
      <p>Magtubo said his group supports the adjustment in operating hours as this was done to help ease traffic congestion in the Metro, especially during the holidays.</p>
      <p>The problem, he said, is that some mall operators might not faithfully pay their employees their hard-earned benefits that are stipulated in the Labor Code.</p>
      <p>“We call upon the DOLE to strictly monitor compliance of labor standards laws by mall employers during and after this policy of adjusting mall hours of work,” said Magtubo.</p>
      <p>He said mall workers should also remind their employers to give them the benefits mandated by law.</p>
      <p>Mall operators have agreed to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority’s request to adjust their operating hours starting this month to ease traffic <br/>congestion.</p>
      <p>From 10 a.m., mall operators have agreed to open their stores at 11 a.m., Monday to Friday, until January 10, 2020.</p>
