      <h1>Heads Up: There Might Be A ‘Friends’ Reunion Special On The Horizon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:27:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:27</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>In our oversaturated world of streaming, <a href="https://junkee.com/friends-best-episodes-ranking/221519"><i>Friends</i></a> is one of the last big nostalgic sitcoms that has yet to be rebooted. But, if the entertainment stars line up, that might all change sometime very soon.</p>
      <p>Yep, the long rumoured, long anticipated reunion might be hitting our screens in the form of one last episode. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-reunion-special-works-at-hbo-max-1254331">According to <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>,</a> who got their information from “sources close” to the situation, a bunch of the key players are talking about inking a deal for a special.</p>
      <p>Those players include Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer. So, ya know, the whole gang.</p>

      <p>Also along for the ride at this tentative, early stage, are the co-creators of the series, who will presumably be onboard to oversee the writing process.</p>
      <p>As <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> take pains to stress, this could all fall apart very quickly. Even if the deal does get signed, that doesn’t necessarily mean that everything will line up right for a special, and negotiations might break down over the writing of the actual script.</p>
      <p>But hey, for a lot of <i>Friends</i> fans, a reunion looked like an actual impossibility. Now, no matter how unlikely, it seems like something that could actually go down.</p>
