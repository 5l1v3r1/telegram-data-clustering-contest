      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rod-stewart">Sir Rod Stewart</a> is hoping to raise £1 million for the fight against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">cancer</a> with an exclusive gig.</p>
      <p>The legendary rocker will host and perform at a secret dinner party, planned by the singer and his wife Penny Lancaster.</p>
      <p>Celebrity access will be part of a charity auction at the event.</p>
      <p>Funds raised by the dinner will go to the Teenage Cancer Trust, and money will be bolstered by an auction of exclusive items.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One prize up for auction is a private dinner with Sir Rod and his wife at The Ritz.</p>
      <p>Those attending the charity event will see the decor designed by the singer, with his favourite flowers, wine and food on display.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> signed guitar, and a chance to accompany Dame Emma Thompson to the premiere of Cruella will also be up for grabs in the auction, along with artwork created by Sir Rod's former bandmate Ronnie Wood.</p>
      <p>All proceeds will go to the Teenage Cancer Trust.</p>
