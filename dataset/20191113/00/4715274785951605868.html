      <p>Local executives who began their terms in July hurdled the 100-day mark this week. In those first days, after winning the vote of their constituents, they became visible to the media and articulated what they intended to do during their term. High hopes were placed on some of the new executives for being able to topple political dynasties and powerful names in their areas. They will do things differently, avoid the same old traps, and be intrepid in introducing changes.</p>

      <p>Some of them worked quietly and diligently even as they faced constant criticism from their predecessors’ supporters. It was a challenge to pursue worthy initiatives, no matter under whose leadership these were begun, and amid the all-too-common tendency to do away with anything identified with their political opponent. Some were weighed down by difficulties in getting anything started—it was a challenge to know where to even begin. Some, too, made themselves available to the media and started fashioning a national image. All these made for an interesting first 100 days. But as in any honeymoon period, euphoria is bound to die down—and reality bound to set in. We wish the new executives the stamina to follow through all their promises and early decisions. The next few months will no doubt be difficult, and may they sustain the interest and the political will they had when they started. Certainly they are aware that the system makes it difficult even for the most optimistic and idealistic to keep faith. The remaining days of their term will separate the true leaders from the flashes in the pan.</p>
