      <h1>Unlimited First Class Flights For Life—How American Airlines Made The Most Expensive Mistake In Aviation History</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">James Asquith</a></address>
      <p>Lots of companies make mistakes. Some mistakes just turn out to be more costly than others. Take Blockbuster Video for example who turned down the chance to buy Netflix for $50 million in 2000. At the time the price was seen as far too high for Blockbuster to pay. Hindsight is a wonderful thing of course, and Netflix is now worth $145 billion, whilst Blockbuster is left with just one token store globally. Or of course Yahoo, who failed to buy Google for $1 billion in 2001 (now worth over $800 billion), and doubling down on refusing to themselves being acquired by Microsoft in 2008 for over $44 billion—eventually Yahoo was sold to Verizon for a little over $4 billion.</p>

      <p>In the case of American Airlines, well, they are still paying for their mistake nearly 30 years later. Their mistake may not hold the same grandiose numbers as the other examples used, but in terms of aviation, which works on thin margins, this was a substantial misjudgement.</p>
      <p>In 1981 American Airlines realised that those metal birds that they make their revenue from required some basic inputs such as fuel and well, staff. Unfortunately for American Airlines, they had run out of cash. Scraping for nickels to keep their fleet flying, American’s former President Robert Crandall wanted to cut costs dramatically and rebuild the airline from the ground up. With high interest rates at the time, the airline came up with an alternative way to try and raise quick cash—by offering unlimited First Class tickets for life, for $250,000 each.</p>

      <p>Inflation-adjusted, these first-class tickets—also known as the AAirpass—would cost $570,000 in 2019, although American discontinued selling them in 1994 after getting 28 customers to buy them.</p>
      <p>The issue that American quickly found out was that although consumers may not abuse an “Unlimited” option in many other arenas—such as unlimited soda at a restaurant, or even an all-inclusive holiday, where the majority of people will still have physical (and dietary) limits of how much food and beverages they will consume—when it came to first-class tickets, the customers who bought the unlimited passes were more than willing to go the extra mile, literally and metaphorically.</p>

      <p>The purchasers of the AAirpass were a level beyond what might be classed as a frequent flyer, with stories of some travelers using the pass to fly as many as 10,000 times, until American Airlines revoked what it had originally promised as “Unlimited lifetime passes.”</p>
      <p>I caught up with Steven Rothstein who was one of the customers who purchased the infamous AAirpass. Rothstein, a former investment banker from Chicago, said that he flew four times a week and American approached him to buy the AAirpass. “They told me that they viewed the AAirpass like a bond, so it was as if I was lending the airline money, and they needed money. So they gave me a very good deal” said Steve.</p>
      <p>There have been other tall tales of AAirpass holders, such as Jacques Vroom, who supposedly flew 2 million miles per year—rumours of flights to London and Paris to simply have lunch with a friend.</p>

      <p>However, in 2007, American Airlines “revenue integrity team” targeted the loss-making operations of the airline, and unsurprisingly, the AAirpass had been unprofitable for decades. Vroom and Rothstein had their “unlimited” passes revoked with American claiming “fraudulent activity.”</p>
      <p>Rothstein claimed he “often gave miles to people with good stories about why they needed to fly someplace. For example, I gave a man in Seattle a ticket to go to his father’s funeral. I gave many people tickets to visit ill family members. I don’t view that as philanthropy, I view that as good deeds.”</p>
      <p>Rothstein now says he doesn’t fly American anymore after they revoked his unlimited AAirpass, and that his favourite carrier now is United.</p>
