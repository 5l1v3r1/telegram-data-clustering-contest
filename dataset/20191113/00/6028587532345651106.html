      <p>In contrast to the Old Money that owns, often for centuries, the wineries of France and Italy, the wineries of California are largely owned by mid-20th century individuals who had achieved affluence in a variety of ways, from investment banking, realty, law, medicine and, in the case of Francis Ford Coppola, the movie business. But as far as I know, the only one to come from the world of car racing is Kevin Buckler, CEO of The Racer’s Group and founder of Adobe Road Winery in Sonoma. His trophies and mementos are on display at the winery in Petaluma.          </p>

      <p>It would be easy enough to pun my way through his story of shifting gears and taking an off ramp into making wine, but his achievements in auto racing are well out of the ordinary. Buckler began his professional career as a race driver in 1995 by winning the California Grand Prix in his Porsche 911, going on to more than 100 victories over three decades that included wins at the 2002 24 Hours of Le Mans and four  victories at the Rolex 24 Hours at Daytona. </p>
      <p>The same year he won at Le Mans, he and his wife, Debra, founded Adobe Road Winery, intending to make first-rate wines on a small scale, saying, “I want to be in the front ranks of California Cabernet Sauvignon makers.  My winemaker Garrett Martin is a ninja, and we both want to be very innovative. And if it costs a little more, so be it.” As when he had his bottle labels’ glue special ordered from the 3M Company.</p>

      <p> In person Buckler, 60, is a down-to-earth Californian. Though he was born in Coral Gables, Florida, he grew up in Newport Beach.</p>
      <p>“What an amazing time growing up in a small beach town, around cool cars, lifestyle, food and wine,” he says, sounding like Sean Penn’s Jeff Spicoli surfer dude in “Fast Times at Ridgement High.” “I had a small blue 240Z, and when I was not playing tennis (I was a ranked Southern California player), we were basically terrorizing the neighborhoods, or finding ways to rip off our dad’s exotics and not get busted!”</p>
      <p>After that lotus-eating period he took a job with Dean Witter in Seattle, “but I  became disillusioned and eventually ended up working for the summer at a real estate development/timeshare-style resort. Eventually I bought my own small campground resort, expanded it to three and with investors became the second-biggest industry turnaround specialist at the age of 29. Several years later I received a buyout offer and gladly accepted and moved back to California in 1992 to chase my dreams of cars and wine.” He still had a gnarly streak after all.         </p>

      <p>When I met Buckler for dinner at New York’s Gotham restaurant, he was wearing jeans and a wildly colored shirt with car imagery, his beard more or less trimmed. He’s wiry, a bit shorter than I expected, resembling a more likeable version of comedian Dennis Miller. He talks fast, uses his hands for emphasis but doesn’t use either West Coast slang or Winespeak clichés.</p>
      <p>Although I could sense he was more interested in talking about wine, he very cordially answered my dull-witted questions about car racing, like “Were Paul Newman and Steve McQueen good racecar drivers?” (They were, for amateurs.)</p>
      <p>Buckler was as animated about racing as he was his winery, saying that he and his wife are proud of being the first winery in the downtown Petaluma area and becoming part of the city’s growing culture. Last month they broke ground at Adobe Road for a new riverfront, state-of-the-art winery and entertainment complex to open next fall with a tasting room with outdoor fire pits, outdoor pizza oven, a 120-person banquet facility, upstairs VIP area and party deck, a motorsports museum and more. As Petaluma Mayor Teresa Barrett said at the groundbreaking ceremony,  “A wine tasting room and a race car showroom in your own town. Who else has that?”</p>
      <p>My familiarity with Adobe Road’s wines was expanded over dinner as we tasted our way through several current releases. The 2017 Chardonnay ($49) was nice and peppery, very lush, not oaky. The 2017 Pinot Noir RR ($68) is one of those rare Sonoma Pinot Noirs that actually tastes like Pinot Noir instead of a syrupy, sweet bruiser of a red wine. It has abundant California sun in its fruit-forward style, but the acids tame it all down so that it is a complex Pinot as delicious in the second or third glass as in the first.</p>

      <p>I thought the 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon Beckstoffer Vineyard Georges III ($155) was overripe, and its 15.5% alcohol did nothing to ameliorate the blast of fruit and tannin. </p>
      <p>The 2016 Apex (now sold out) was far more appealing at 14.9% alcohol. I later tasted the 2018 ($78) and found it equally as delicious: a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon from Dry Creek Valley, 23% Famighetti Vineyards' Syrah, 20% Carbernet Franc and “an inky drop” of  5% Petite Syrah  and 2% Petit Verdot from Rockpile vineyard in far northern Sonoma County. </p>
      <p>The 2016 Semillon Late Harvest ($65 for a half-bottle) was a ringer for a fine Sauternes or Barsac, full of honey sweetness moderated by a good backbone of acid. </p>
      <p>This season Buckler is releasing a beautifully packaged gift box called The Racing Series, four wines emblazoned with a racing motif: APEX 2016 depicts the inner edge of a track curve; REDLINE 2016 represents the maximum engine speed before damage occurs; SHIFT 2016 shows off a distinctive metal shifter as its label; and ‘THE 24’ 2016 has the signature chronograph frame awarded to winners of 24- hour races like Daytona and Le Mans. All four Racing Series wines are California blends, ranging in price from $35 to $76, or available in the limited-production four- bottle gift box for $279.</p>
      <p>By the end of the evening, after such good food and wines, I could see that Buckler’s enthusiasm and zeal for accomplishing excellence through innovation and a little dose of show biz had both succeeded and paid off. He’s a very happy, high-energy guy. I had only one last question: “Where can I get one of those shirts?”         </p>
