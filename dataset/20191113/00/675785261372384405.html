      <h2>Davies planning to emulate Liverpool legend for club and country ahead of England U21 qualifier against Albania on Friday</h2>

      <p>Tom Davies has set his sights on being the new Steven Gerrard.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder, 21, has been compared to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and England great for his box-to-box game following his goal in the 2-1 win at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tom-davies">Davies</a> wants to emulate Reds legend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a> in the blue of Everton and the white of England.</p>
      <p>“He was a quality player,” said Davies, who is with the England Under-21s squad preparing for the Euro U21s qualifier away to Albania on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“To even be compared to him is just good to hear. He is a local lad – around the city everyone knows him. If I can do that for Everton, that’s the idea. I’d love to do that.</p>

      <p>“I wouldn’t say I’m exactly the same as him but in my head I know I can be a top quality player. My main focus is improving my game.</p>
      <p>“I feel like I can become a quality player. It’s about reaching the potential that I have. It’s in my hands to dictate that.”</p>
      <p>Davies started off as an attacking midfielder rampaging forwards, but has also looked equally as happy in the anchorman role.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve always been a box-to-box midfielder as a kid. That’s my position.</p>

      <p>“But this role I’ve been playing for England suits me well. I’m happy doing either. I don’t mind.</p>
      <p>“I can do that. When I first broke into Everton’s team it was that attacking position – just put me anywhere in midfield and I’ll be happy.”</p>
      <p>Davies is just four short of 100 appearances for Everton but his goal at St Mary’s was only his fifth for the club.</p>
      <p>“I’m always looking to improve and goalscoring is definitely an area that I can, whether it be scoring or assisting,” he admitted.</p>

      <p>“A goal at the weekend shows I can do it. I want to do it more often.”</p>
      <p>After his goal, Davies received a text of congratulations from Andre Gomes, who is recovering after his dislocated ankle.</p>
      <p>“He texted me after the game saying, ‘Well done’ for the goal and stuff,” said Davies.</p>

      <p>“He’s doing well and hopefully he might be able to get back before the end of the season.</p>
      <p>“We’re all gutted for him. But he’ll come back stronger than ever – that’s the type of lad he is. As for me, I’m just looking to stay in the team.</p>
      <p>“Andre and me were playing together in the middle. That was down to us both doing well in training and we had a good partnership.”</p>
