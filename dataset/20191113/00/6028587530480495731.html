      <p>“It’s time we get reacquainted with Picasso,” Marc Glimcher, President and CEO of Pace said on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Pace Palo Alto art gallery, and the opening of a wondrous, small but well-curated chronological survey of Pablo Picasso, “Seeing Picasso: Maker of the Modern.” The exhibition will be on view at Pace Palo Alto until February 16, 2020.  Go. More than once. It is worth the trip.</p>

      <p>“Seeing Picasso,” features more than 35 paintings, sculptures, drawings and collages, drawn from various stages of Picasso’s life and career, never before gathered together in this fashion – and with no immediate plans for the show to travel elsewhere.</p>
      <p>In a panel discussion prior to exhibition’s opening held at Stanford University’s Cantor Center for the Arts, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso (Grandson of Picasso’s first wife Olga) and Diana Widmaier Picasso  (granddaughter of Picasso’s inamorata Marie-Therese Walter) discussed the exhibition in conversation with Glimcher. Using slides of the works in the exhibition as well as other landmarks in Picasso’s artistic career, Glimcher’s inquiry sought to explore the building blocks of Picasso’s maverick rule-breaking creativity.</p>

      <p>If there was a theme to the conversation and the exhibition, it was this: We think we know Picasso. However, Picasso’s great fame has, over time, fossilized our perception of him. Or as Glimcher put it, “The more famous, the less we know him.” But the artist Picasso was endlessly inventive. Throughout his life, he continued to seek out ways to innovate in a multitude of mediums. “He never repeated himself twice,” Ruiz-Picasso said, explaining that although Picasso returned to themes or styles, each time he did so differently – he brought what he had done forward, but did so in new ways. The other point that Ruiz-Picasso made that really stuck with me is that Picasso was an artist of the Freudian Century, and that, as Ruiz-Picasso said, “He didn’t hide.” Whatever was happening in the world and in his life found its way into his art, as this exhibition demonstrates.</p>
      <p>In the discussion, Glimcher was particularly interested in uncovering Picasso’s “building blocks” and how the various places he lived added to his artistic development. In Malaga, his father was his first art teacher and Picasso showed an academic prowess in drawing. At 13, the family moved to A Coruna where Picasso entered an art school there further developing his talent along classical lines. Picasso’s sister Conchita died that year of diphtheria – a traumatic event in his life. Soon thereafter, the family moved again, this time to Barcelona where Picasso transferred to the School of Fine Arts. In Barcelona , Picasso would visit the Prado and study the old masters, particularly Rembrandt, Velasquez, El Greco and Goya, all of whom Picasso absorbed into his work and would return to, reference and borrow from throughout his life.</p>
      <p>Picasso was next sent to an art school in Madrid, — where he did terribly. Rather than attend class, Picasso fell in with a group of young artists and poets in Barcelona, many of whom congregated at Els Quatre Gats Café (The Four Cats) for which Picasso did some posters and advertising, adopting a Toulouse-Lautrec-type style and bold colors. From Madrid, Picasso began to visit Paris, eventually moving there. In Paris, he would not only meet other artists, but see a wide world of people living as he was on the fringes. And he would visit the Louvre to see the classical masterpieces there, and to the Museum of Man, where he saw African art for the first time.</p>
      <p>The exhibition begins with an early watercolor study of woman whose hair is in a chignon surrounded by studies of her hands (foreshadowing the way Picasso would analyze and break down portraiture with cubism and in later works). There is also on oil Picasso painted in 1896 at 15 of his sister holding a doll on her lap. Painted on a panel, this could be an old master portrait but there is something about the direct almost mournful gaze of his sister that is haunting. There is an unexpected dreamlike quality to the work, an emotional dimension in the way the oil paint was applied. (Picasso may have still been mourning the loss of their sister Conchita).</p>
      <p>Picasso’s arrival in Paris, as a poor destitute artist, an immigrant, an outsider, living in Montmartre along with other poverty-stricken individuals was Glimcher said, the next ingredient in Picasso’s development. Picasso’s great friend, the poet Casagemas committed suicide and this affected Picasso deeply. Together with the lingering loss of his sister, this launched Picasso into his Blue period.</p>
      <p>In the Pace Palo Alto exhibition there is a painting of “The Dead Casagemas” from 1901. The brushwork is rough and Casagemas is in profile looking deathly pale. There is a blemish at his temple – that on closer inspection is revealed to be a bullet hole. Picasso never saw Casagemas dead but painted this to express his mourning.</p>
      <p>“Seeing Picasso” is not a “greatest hits” exhibition, yet each of the items reflects a dimension of Picasso’s artistic exploration. So, for example, a charcoal and pencil drawing from 1906, the bust of a naked woman, is already sculptural in its approach and we can see in the way the lines are drawn the seeds of transformation to come. In just a year, Picasso will have drawn “Visage Triste,” where the head and shoulders of a woman begin to resemble an African Mask, presaging Picasso’s revolutionary painting “Les Demoiselles D’Avignon” from 1907.</p>
      <p>There is an early sculpture by Picasso, a black bronze of a joker from 1905, showing Picasso venturing into different artistic forms. In a series of drawings from as early as 1910 and between 1912-1914, we see Picasso at work in the Cubist deconstruction of planes and forms inherent in drawing a figure.</p>
      <p>One of the more remarkable objects in the exhibition is a sculpture called “Le Verre d’Absinthe” (The Glass of Absinthe) from 1914. It is only eight inches high and looks quite crude, like a tossed- off afterthought – and there is very little about it that looks like a glass of absinthe – at least conventionally. But on closer inspection, what Picasso has done is rearranged the glass into an object, a shamanistic, ritual object – the copper is painted like some primitive totem. This magic vessel (for absinthe drinkers are indeed transported) includes as part of its fabrication an absinthe spoon (the absinthe was poured through a sugar cube). Now that may not seem revolutionary, but Picasso is flaunting the rules of traditional sculpture, even of traditional artistic practice by including a found object – something that would be taken up famously by Marcel Duchamp a few years later.</p>
      <p>I would gladly review each item in the exhibition for they are each exceptional but for the sake of brevity, let me say there are drawings and collages showing Picasso transforming drawing and painting into 3-dimentional assemblages (some 40 or 50 years before Rauschenberg’s combines). There are works of painting and sculpture that shows an interest in surrealism and biomorphic forms – and charcoal on canvas drawings that presaged Picasso’s own later sculptures drawn in space. There are paintings he made during World War Two that are very dark and attest to his then-worldview.</p>
      <p>After the War, we see Picasso once again finding his joy, taking up ceramics and pottery in the South of France. There is a simple but very witty painted ceramic vase called “Bikini.” Among my other favorites in the exhibition is a small portrait of Marie-Therese that looks unlike any other Picasso (save for the oval face) and which one could easily imagine having been painted today by a contemporary artist.</p>
      <p>Picasso and the women he painted is a fraught subject. Picasso’s personal life and his behavior towards the women in his life was at times excused because of his “genius” so-called. Today, his behavior is recognized as monstrous, deservedly so. Ruiz-Picasso, the grandson of Picasso’s first wife Olga, did not shy away from this, and doesn’t disagree. And there was no disagreement from Diana Widmaier Picasso on that either (Widmaier Picasso is a highly accomplished scholar and business person with a law degree and an art history degree who took on the task of assembling a catalogue raisonne of Picasso’s sculptures).</p>
      <p>At the Cantor, Ruiz-Picasso referred to Francoise Gilot the only one of Picasso’s women to survive him (and he did not mean chronologically). Ruiz-Picasso noted, however, that Picasso never hid the turmoil he caused, it was there on his canvases. As an example, Ruiz-Picasso noted that during the period where Picasso was juggling a wife and two mistresses and created what, at the time, seemed like a disaster he could not escape, his work returned to mythology and the Minotaur trying to find his way out of the maze. And when we look upon his 1938 portrait of Dora Maar at Pace Palo Alto, we see the sexiness he saw in her.</p>
      <p>One of the benefits of the Palo Alto exhibit is to be able to see this chronology of Picasso in a small space, so that in each room your eye can travel across the work and across the decades to see how, as Ruiz-Picasso said, “Picasso never left anything behind, it is always there.” The work in the exhibition is all hung at eye level so you can survey the work across the decades and how the eyes in the paintings stay the same and yet change.  Even when Picasso returned to classicism, there were always innovations in how he painted his muses – one could see the extended wrists he used in his blue period paintings of the Saltimbanques and the simplified lines he used in his more avant-garde works. The exhibition includes several late works, two different “Head of a Man” from his final years, where his palette is darker, again –where he is facing death head on.</p>
      <p>At the Press Preview, Glimcher and Ruiz-Picasso told me how important it was to have this exhibition in Palo Alto. Part of our mission, Ruiz-Picasso said, is education. New York and Los Angeles have seen Picasso exhibitions, but an exhibition like this had never been to Palo Alto, he said. Glimcher added that in the five years of Pace Palo Alto’s existence he’d found an educated, interested audience for their exhibitions. Given the crowd who attended the Cantor Arts Center panel, there is little doubt that the encounter with Picasso in Palo Alto will be well appreciated by the community. Also, for the exhibition, Pace has created an iPad-optimized app that can be used in the exhibition room, that provides a guided discussion of the works in the context of each other and Picasso’s life by Stanford’s Alexander Nemerov.</p>
      <p>At several points in the day’s proceedings Ruiz-Picasso was asked about his personal connection to the work, and I asked whether he saw a personal dimension that gave him particular insight into the works on display in “Seeing Picasso.” Interestingly, Ruiz-Picasso said his memories of his grandfather are just those of any child blessed with a nice, fun, grandfather.</p>
      <p>The passage of time, and a new century, Ruiz-Picasso said, allows one more objectivity. There was so much of Picasso that had not been seen or even known, so many projects Picasso left unfinished or never undertaken, that we are now seeing Picasso more completely, and are able to think about his work more deeply. Ruiz-Picasso admitted that even after all the time he has spent with his grandfather’s work, he is still learning.</p>
      <p>Picasso’s relentless artistic innovation, as “Maker of the Modern,” is on exhibit in Palo Alto, Ruiz-Picasso said, so that we can begin to see Picasso again.</p>
