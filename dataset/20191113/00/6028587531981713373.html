      <p>This week has been all about the launch of Disney’s new streaming service and the addition of 7,500 episodes of television and 500 films to an already oversaturated streaming landscape. What has become abundantly clear is that despite the A-list names attached to a new series, an eight-digit budget per episode or a show’s attachment to a top tier streaming service, entertainment today is being held to a higher standard than ever before. A show cannot survive if it is just good. It must be terrific and grab an audience immediately if it is to survive.</p>
      <p>This is where a show like <i>For All Mankind, </i>one of Apple TV+’s flagship series, could potentially get lost in the shuffle. This series has a slower burn but there is a payoff and it is well worth your time. A show like this needs (and deserves) positive word of mouth amidst the deluge of streaming content currently available.</p>
      <p>The new 10-episode sci-fi drama starring Joel Kinnaman takes viewers on a riveting “what if” scenario that explores an alternative take on history as told through NASA’s astronauts and the space program’s innovators and their families.</p>
      <p>Envisioned by Ronald D. Moore (<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, <i>Outlander</i>), the<b> </b>story takes a left turn from the reality of the U.S. winning the “space race” to the moon and instead explores how history could’ve taken a very different turn had the Russian flag been planted on the Moon before the American flag.</p>
      <p>Moore, a Golden Globe nominee and Emmy Award winner, created the series and executive produces his version of what would’ve been a massive setback for NASA and the U.S. In this telling, the global space race never ended and the space program remained the cultural centerpiece of America’s hopes and dreams.</p>
      <p>The series is set in Houston, Texas, home to NASA headquarters, and the fascinating alternate reality is set against all the colorful glamour and sex appeal of the 1960s and 1970s that fans loved with <i>Mad Men, </i>but this story swaps out business suits for space suits and ad execs for astronauts. And, there’s a catch: it takes a few episodes to get to the good stuff.</p>
      <p>Already busy filming season two, Kinnaman took time to discuss his latest TV project, as well as the challenge of grabbing viewers’ attention. <b>“</b>There’s pressure to capture an audience. I think about that, of course, and I gauge my own behavior. Had some of my favorite shows come out at this time, with so much competition, I may have stopped watching and tuned out. Someone would have to tell me to stick with this or that one and tell me it’s fantastic.”</p>
      <p>Kinnaman’s acting resume includes a plethora of captivating TV projects, such as <i>Altered Carbon, The Killing,</i><b><i> </i></b><i>Hanna</i><b><i> </i></b>and<i> House of Cards</i><b><i>, </i></b>as well as movie roles in <i>Suicide Squad </i>and <i>RoboCop</i>. He’s particular in the types of roles he takes on.</p>

      <p>In <i>For All Mankind</i>, Kinnaman portrays Edward Baldwin, a brilliant fighter pilot turned astronaut in NASA’s Apollo program. He’s haunted by a decision he made while commanding the Apollo 10 mission, which may have given the Soviets an edge in being the first to touch down on the moon.</p>
      <p>“I look for characters and stories that I haven’t done before,” explains Kinnaman. “I really want to find something new. I’m not interested in playing the straight-up hero, the guy who wants to save the world. What was really interesting and what drew me to Ed was he’s an all American hero and he has this façade he shows the world, but there’s a lot of other stuff going on inside of him, under the surface. There are cracks in his façade. There’s a lot of anger and sadness underneath his bravado. He’s a man of his time and doesn’t show his emotions, keeps stuff bottled up. He can’t connect to his son, has anger and his temper runs and he loses control. It’s really interesting to play a guy that has those kinds of instincts as a person, that doesn’t show emotions and then he gets struck by the ultimate nightmare and tragedy.”</p>
      <p>Avoiding spoilers, let’s just say Ed experiences a life-altering event and his character undergoes a huge transformation. “It was really interesting to play a high-functioning individual who has been on a specific path his entire life and knows exactly what he wants. But in the aftermath of this event, he becomes a different person. That was a compelling idea to me.”</p>
      <p>It was this twist that got him to sign on. “This was the selling point for me. To portray this type of tragedy is really challenging. And, to see someone that is in so many ways as formidable as he is, and at same time is not very good at dealing with emotions, was unique. Here he’s confronted with something he can’t keep away from. It’s too powerful. The way he copes is very well-written. There is an emotional misdirection as to how Ed deals with this that, for an actor, is a really interesting arc and storyline to work with.”</p>
      <p>As for the challenges in obtaining and keeping viewers today, Kinnaman explains that audiences may have to give this show a few episodes. “With our show, it takes a few episodes to really understand what the show is. It has to reach that level where enough people have seen it to the end and start telling friends to watch. Our show is one of those that takes a while to build.”</p>

      <p>Data from <a href="https://www.parrotanalytics.com/">Parrot Analytics</a> confirms the ‘slow burn’ of <i>For All Mankind </i>isn’t hurting the show. According to the data, people are giving this one a chance and it’s paying off as the show’s demand grew significantly in its first seven days. From November 1-7, per capita demand for the series grew by 97.6% in the U.S., 147% in the UK and 220% in Canada.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the series has high global Momentum, which is defined as the cumulative demand for titles that have been trending upwards in demand this year, indexed to the average momentum of the genre. <i>For All Mankind</i> has 3.75 times more Momentum than the average title in the drama genre. Only 10% of all shows reach this high level of Momentum.</p>
      <p>“The grandest episode is not the first. This show has a sort of thoughtful taste. It’s not trying to be anything it’s not,” Kinnaman adds. “It reveals itself to the audience in episodes four and five. This was the feeling I had when reading the scripts and as we began filming. I realized there was a lot of set up for eight different characters but there’s great pay off. There are no threads left unconnected at the end of season one and there’s a perfect set up for season two.”</p>
      <p>Circling back to the competitive streaming landscape, Kinnaman is experiencing the upside. “As an actor, in terms of employment, there’s so much opportunity right now. I’m having a great time doing exactly what I want to be doing: a series I love, big event comic book movies and small arthouse indie dramas. I want to do all these things and I’m very aware that it’s much harder to capture an audience now and break into mainstream.<b> </b>There’s so much good content. Our show is one of Apple’s marquee flagship shows, so of course we really want it to break through. Our<b> </b>show takes a while to reveal itself to the audience. By the end of season two, you’re going to realize this show is really ambitious and world-creating in a way you wouldn’t expect. I believe when there’s something that’s really great it will find its audience.”<b> </b></p>
      <p>It’s extremely interesting to see how the show creators and writers envisioned the continuing ripple effects had the Soviets beat the U.S. to the moon. Their version includes Ted Kennedy cancelling his trip to Chappaquiddick to deal with the crisis, which in turn triggers a big turn in the 1972 presidential election. Moore felt creating an alternate history would present an opportunity to explore some of today’s social and political issues, including women going to the moon much sooner than reality allowed.</p>
      <p>In addition to Kinnaman’s latest film, <i>Three Seconds, </i>based on the bestselling Swedish novel by Anders Roslund and Börge Hellström, he has several upcoming projects in the works, including Andrea Di Stefano's <i>The Informer</i>, the crime drama <i>The Sound Of Philadelphia</i> and Yuval Adler's <i>The Secrets We Keep</i>. Kinnaman is also in production on <i>The Suicide Squad.</i></p>
      <p>Rounding out the cast are Michael Dorman, Sarah Jones, Shantel Vansanten, Wrenn Schmidt, Jodi Balfour, Krys Marshall, Arturo Del Puerto, Olivia Trujillo, Sonya Walger and Chris Bauer. Alongside Moore, Golden Globe and Emmy nominees Ben Nedivi and Matt Wolpert (<i>Fargo, American Crime Story: The People V.S. OJ Simpson)</i> executive produce with Golden Globe nominee Maril Davis (<i>Outlander, Battlestar Galactica</i>) of Tall Ship Productions. <i>For All Mankind</i> is produced by Sony Pictures Television.</p>
