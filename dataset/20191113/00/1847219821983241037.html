        <b>Estonian <i>Eesti Gaas</i> subsidiary <i>SIA EG Energija</i>, which operates under <i>Elenger</i> brand, has commenced supplying Latvia with gas from Klaipeda floating gas terminal, as reported by <i>Elenger Latvija</i> board member Dāvis Skulte.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The company has signed a contract with Lithuania’s company <i>Klaipedos nafta</i> on gas supplies and transit to the gas network from Klaipeda floating terminal ship Independence.</p>
      <p>«By commencing supplies from Klaipeda floating terminal, we increase resource variety and independence for our customers. For us this means access to the global market and four our clients – access to better prices, because there are more supply sources,» comments Dāvis Skulte.</p>
      <p>So far the company has procured some gas from Klaipeda liquefied natural gas terminal and has transported it to clients in Estonia and Latvia using specialized cargo trucks.</p>
      <p>The objective of the new contract is gasifying the procured liquefied gas and diverting it to the network so that it is possible to deliver the gas via pipelines.</p>
      <p>The contract for supplies for small amounts of liquefied gas using Klaipeda terminal was signed at the end of 2017. Over the course of two years, Lithuania has procured 2 600 tonnes of liquefied natural gas.</p>
      <p>The company supplies natural gas and liquefied natural gas from Russia, Latvia, Finland and Poland.</p>
