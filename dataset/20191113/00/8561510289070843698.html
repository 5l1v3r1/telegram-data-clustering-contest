      <h1>Nuclear Waste Tomb Unlikely to Survive Climate Change</h1>

      <h3>Radiation Situation</h3>
      <p>There’s a ticking time bomb in the middle of the Pacific Ocean — and climate change could set it off at any moment.</p>
      <p>A new <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/marshall-islands-nuclear-testing-sea-level-rise/">investigation</a> by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> has found that the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/radioactive-waste-coffin-leaking-pacific">Runit Dome</a> — a massive “tomb” in the Marshall Islands containing radioactive soil and debris from nuclear bomb tests — is at risk of busting open as climate change causes both sea levels and temperatures to rise.</p>
      <h3>Bombs Away</h3>
      <p>During the Cold War, the United States detonated 67 nuclear bombs in the Marshall Islands. It also conducted a dozen biological weapons tests in the region and shipped 130 tons of irradiated soil from a Nevada testing site there.</p>
      <p>The U.S. then mixed all that irradiated soil and debris with concrete, dumped it into a crater created by one of the bombs, and capped the whole thing off with an 18-inch-thick concrete dome in 1980.</p>
      <h3>Passing the Buck</h3>
      <p>According to the <i>LA Times</i> story, climate change has already caused cracks in the nuclear tomb.</p>
      <p>That’s led officials in the Marshall Islands to ask the U.S. government for help securing the Runit Dome’s contents — but they were told that since the dome is on land belonging to the Marshall Islands, it’s the Marshallese government’s responsibility.</p>
      <p>“I’m like, how can it [the dome] be ours?” Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine told the <i>LA Times</i>. “We don’t want it. We didn’t build it. The garbage inside is not ours. It’s theirs.”</p>
