      <p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/pharmaceuticals/aurobindopharma/AP">Aurobindo Pharma</a>, India's second-largest drug maker, on November 13 said it is expecting the nod of US antitrust watchdog Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its $900 million Sandoz deal in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Sandoz is the generic arm of Swiss-pharma giant Novartis.</p>
      <p>"Things have been moving along positively and we believe that we have substantially addressed all the requirements to obtain (FTC) approval," said Swami Iyer, CFO - North America, Aurobindo Pharma, at the company's earnings call.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/javascript:;">Close</a>
      </p>
      <p>Iyer said the company expects the approval to come in the next few weeks, possibly before December.</p>
      <p>The company had announced <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/aurobindo-pharma-acquires-sandozs-dermatology-oral-solid-biz-in-us-for-900-million-2922431.html">the acquisition</a> of Sandoz's dermatology and formulations business in September last year, making it the largest outbound deal by an Indian pharma company.</p>
      <p>However, the closure of the deal got delayed for reasons the company never made public. It hinted that the delay was on account of queries related to product and their transfers.</p>
      <p><i>The Economic Times</i> earlier this month <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/aurobindos-buyout-of-sandoz-assets-delayed-on-ftc-query/articleshow/71947933.cms">reported</a> that FTC was digging into a lawsuit that involves the Indian drugmaker.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Regulatory issues</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aurobindo also clarified that it is expecting re-inspection of its three manufacturing facilities, which are under  USFDA scanner in the fourth quarter of FY20. USFDA issued warning letter to Unit-11, and classified Unit-9 and Unit-11 as official action indicated (OAI).</p>
      <p>The warning letter and OAI have put lid on around 20 new approvals filed from these  plants.</p>
      <p> "With regards to closure of CAPAs (corrective and preventive action), we are sending our response (to USFDA) before November 15," said N Govindarajan, MD of Aurobindo Pharma.<br/><a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
