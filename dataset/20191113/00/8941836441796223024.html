      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain will send their teams to Qatar for the Gulf Cup of Nations, reversing a decision to avoid playing in their neighboring country they have collectively boycotted for 2 ½ years.</p>
      <p>The Saudi and UAE soccer bodies say they have accepted renewed invitations to play from the Doha-based Arab Gulf Cup Football Federation.</p>
      <p>The Nov. 24-Dec. 6 tournament should now include all eight federation members, including defending champion Oman.</p>
      <p>The decision to play in Qatar, the 2022 World Cup host nation, suggests an easing of relations in a political, economic and transport boycott of Qatar since June 2017.</p>
      <p>The previous Gulf Cup tournament two years ago was moved from Qatar to Kuwait.</p>
