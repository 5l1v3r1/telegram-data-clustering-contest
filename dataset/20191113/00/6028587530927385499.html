      <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are right around the corner — and you might assume that they’ll be the best times to buy new TVs. While they will certainly have some excellent deals to offer, you can actually take advantage of some incredible TV deals right now, straight from eBay. Through many of these deals, you’ll be able to save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on some of the best sets on the market. The deals are available on a range of big and small televisions and come from a variety of vendors. Best of all, they’re available on televisions in any price range.</p>
      <p>Read on for our roundup of outstanding television deals you can get now and take a peek at the following opportunities to save cash.</p>
      <h3>LG OLED65E8P</h3>

      <p>LG’s OLED TVs are considered by many to be the best of the best in TV technology, and the LG E8 is an excellent example of why. The TV is well-designed, offers incredible image quality, and some super-smart features. OLED TVs have the ability to turn on and off individual pixels -- and the result is that black levels are much deeper and more natural than other TVs. You’ll also get LG’s much-loved WebOS operating system, and a 65-inch display, which should be more than big enough for most. The TV is an absolute steal at $1,679 — or 66 percent off its original price.</p>

      <p>Perhaps you’re looking for a decent TV on a budget, and this 50-inch TV from Samsung is a solid choice if so.

Usually, you’ll pay $799.95 for the TV, but it’s currently available from eBay for $329.</p>

      <p>If you want something a little bigger, then the 55S425 TV from TCL is another great option. This TV has the super-smart Roku operating system built into it, with a 4K resolution and support for HDR, so you’ll be able to easily enjoy all your favorite content. Sure, you won’t get image qualities like those in LG’s OLED TVs, but it still looks pretty good — especially for a TV in this price range. Speaking of price, while you’ll normally pay $599.99 for this TV, you can currently get it for half off, at $299.99</p>

      <p>LG’s OLED TVs may be relatively expensive, but even the company’s cheaper TVs have a lot to offer. The LG 55SM8600PUA offers a 4K resolution with HDR support, along with the super-smart WebOS operating system and local dimming, to allow for still-deep black-levels. Like some others on this list, it also has a 120Hz refresh rate — meaning that it should be able to handle those fast-paced scenes pretty well. The TV normally comes at $1,199.95, but you can now get it for $502.96, which is $696.99 off its normal price.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Samsung has some pretty incredible image technology of its own. Samsung leverages a technology called quantum dots for its high-end TVs, making for incredibly deep black levels and bright, vivid colors. Thanks to the dimming zones, you’ll get deep, natural black levels too — even approaching those on offer in LG’s high-end TVs. This particular deal is for a massive 82-inch TV in Samsung’s Q60R series — and it’s available for $1,849, or 69 percent off its original price.</p>
