      <h1>A Supermassive Black Hole Yeeted This Star at 3.7 Million MPH</h1>

      <h3>Yeet!</h3>
      <p>Five million years ago, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way sent an unfortunate star rocketing away at millions of miles per hour.</p>
      <p>The star, recently spotted by Carnegie Mellon University astronomers, is on its way out of the galaxy at 3.7 million miles per hour — a speed so high that it will never return, <a href="https://www.space.com/star-ejected-milky-way-black-hole-superfast-speed.html">according to <i>Space.com</i></a>. Putting aside how metal it is that a black hole ejected a star from the galaxy, the discovery also helped astronomers confirm a whole slew of hypotheses about how stars and giant black holes can interact.</p>
      <h3>Runaway</h3>
      <p>This runaway star, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stz3081/5612212">described in research</a> published last week in the journal <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>, is not the first that scientists have seen <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/runaway-star-escaping-black-hole">rapidly fleeing a black hole</a>. But it is the first that astronomers can clearly trace its path back to a supermassive black hole, <i>Space.com</i> reports.</p>
      <p>That means scientists finally had the evidence to argue that ejections of the sort are actually possible.</p>
      <h3>Good Luck</h3>
      <p>Since most things near supermassive black holes suffer a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/astronomers-black-hole-shred-star">more disastrous fate</a>, all we can do is say godspeed — and wish it luck on its journey.</p>
      <p>“Seeing this star is really amazing as we know it must have formed in the galactic center, a place very different to our local environment,” Ting Li, a Carnegie Observatory and Princeton University scientist <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/news/runaway-star-was-ejected-heart-darkness">said in a press release</a>. “It is a visitor from a strange land.”</p>
