      <h3>Key News</h3>
      <p>Asian equities were a sea of red as President Trump’s Economic Club of NY speech wasn’t the Vince Lombardi pep talk investors had hoped for. The Art of the Deal was in full effect as President Trump dangled a Phase One deal but carried a heavy stick by threatening more tariffs if a deal isn’t signed. One global broker is calling Trump’s bluff after their firm’s economics team calculated that an escalation in US tariffs all but guarantees a US recession pre-election. Not a good game plan if you want to get reelected. Hong Kong fell as ~1,000 largely student protesters funneled into the financial district (Central) creating havoc for commuters and office works. I noticed one Asian broker did not include a Hong Kong market summary today, which tells me that they sent their staff home early to avoid the mess. If these tactics continue financial firms and others will pick up and move to Singapore and/or Shanghai as it just isn’t worth the hassle. Hong Kong real estate stocks were weak reflecting this reality. It is a remote possibility at this stage that this downward spiral occurs as the general populace is the biggest loser in this outcome. Premier Li did give a speech promoting counter cyclical measures, i.e. stimulus, though trade news seemed to cast a shadow on Mainland markets nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Alibaba’s Hong Kong IPO has become mainstream news today as a November 25th listing date appears to be in order. The full $15B listing is expected as demand appears strong. This should be a great thing for the US listing as the Hong Kong listing will trade at a higher P/E than than the US listing. Due to arbitrage, the Hong Kong listing should “pull” the US listing up.</p>
      <p>Tencent (700 HK) reported Q3 earnings after the Hong Kong close today. The results missed analyst estimates though were not as poor as headlines would suggest. While revenues increased nicely, the company’s expenses increased, which rolls down the income statement. I’m surprised analysts didn’t lower their estimates as Bytedance’s popularity in pulling advertising dollars was evident in Q2 earnings. Analysts remained very bullish. I find it laughable that China’s economy is given as a reason for the miss. Did anybody notice Monday’s Singles Day?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue +21% to $13.748B (RMB 97.236B) from RMB 80.595 YoY versus estimate 99.04B</li>
