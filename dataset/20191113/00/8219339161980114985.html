      <h1>Walmart adds integration with Siri as it expands Voice Ordering feature</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:08:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Walmart has announced that it is integrating with Siri on iOS to allow shoppers to easily add items to their cart. The new Voice Order feature allows you interact with Walmart by simply telling Siri to “Add to Walmart.”</p>
      <p>The new Siri Shortcut from Walmart is designed for the retailer’s Online Grocery Pickup and Delivery services. This means you can gradually add items to your shopping cart using Siri throughout the week, then place your order for pickup or delivery when you’re ready.</p>
      <p>Walmart explains how the feature works:</p>
      <blockquote>Customers build out their basket by just saying “Add to Walmart” and then naming the product they want to add to their cart. After that, customers can place their order and Walmart personal shoppers get to work gathering the items for the customer, who can pick the order up on the way home or have it delivered right to their door.</blockquote>
      <p>To power this feature, Walmart will tap into your order history for specific item information. For example, if you say “add orange juice to my cart,” the Walmart app will check your purchase history to see what kind of orange juice you usually buy, and add that specific type to your cart.</p>
      <p>If you want to give this feature a try today, download the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walmart-grocery-shopping/id998754894">Walmart Grocery App for iOS</a>, then tap on the new “Voice Shopping” settings shown on your account page. Read Walmart’s full announcement below.</p>
      <pre><br/>Hey Siri, Add to Walmart: Introducing a New Shortcut for Online Grocery<br/>Earlier this year we announced a new way to make Online Grocery shopping even easier for customers – Walmart Voice Order – a service that gives customers the option to add items to their Walmart Online Grocery Cart by simply saying the words.<br/><br/>Today, we’re proud to announce that partnering with Apple, we’ve made Walmart Voice Order available on Siri. We are always looking for new ways to bring our customers the best experiences when buying Apple products from Walmart and when using their Apple devices every day.<br/><br/>We are introducing a new Siri Shortcut for Online Grocery. Customers simply ask Siri to start adding items directly to their Walmart Online Grocery cart after they’ve paired their accounts. It feels a little like magic on an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod or in the car with CarPlay.<br/><br/>Customers build out their basket by just saying “Add to Walmart” and then naming the product they want to add to their cart. After that, customers can place their order and Walmart personal shoppers get to work gathering the items for the customer, who can pick the order up on the way home or have it delivered right to their door.<br/><br/>We built Walmart Voice Order with customers in mind. We designed the entire experience for voice shopping to help save time in the kitchen, in the car, or on the go. We know customers are busy and we’re here to help.<br/><br/>The more customers use it, the better the experience will be. Customers can trust that we can quickly and accurately identify the items they are asking for, thanks to information from their purchase history with us. For example, if a customer says, “add orange juice to my cart,” we’ll make sure to add the specific orange juice the customer buys regularly. Instead of saying “Great Value organic orange juice with no pulp,” they’ll simply say: “orange juice” and we’ll add the right one.<br/><br/>We know when using voice technology, customers add items to their cart one at a time over a few days rather than shopping for the entire week all at once. Apple and Walmart make that simple by allowing users to participate wherever they are in their grocery shopping journey, on whichever Apple device they’re using.<br/><br/>Walmart Voice Order now works across leading voice assistants. Pair that with the reach of Online Grocery Pickup and Delivery, and nearly eighty percent of the country can order groceries by just saying what items they need.<br/><br/>To get started, customers simply go to the Walmart Grocery App and click “Voice Shopping” within their account page.<br/><br/>We won’t stop here – we’ll keep working with the best companies in the world to bring to life experiences that make shopping even easier for our customers. When we combine two trusted brands, innovation and scale, Walmart and Apple customers win.<br/><br/></pre>
