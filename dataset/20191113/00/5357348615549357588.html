        <b>WASHINGTON, DC, United States (AFP) — Mark Sanford, a former governor of South Carolina, abandoned his long shot bid yesterday to challenge President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sanford, 59, announced he was suspending his campaign in a statement on his <i>Facebook</i> page.</p>
      <p>“I am suspending my race because impeachment has made our goal of making the debt, deficit and spending issue a part of this presidential debate impossible right now,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Impeachment literally pulls all the oxygen from the room that could be used to discuss a host of other issues,” Sanford said.</p>
      <p>“The Republican Party is made up of good people, but it has been misled by this president and turned in a direction that will bring self-inflicted injury both to the party and the conservative movement for years to come,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Democratic-led House of Representatives is to open public impeachment inquiry hearings today accusing Trump of abuse of power.</p>
      <p>Sanford's bid to challenge the sitting president for the Republican nomination failed to gain much traction since he threw his name into the ring two months ago.</p>
      <p>His departure from the race leaves two other Republicans waging long shot bids for the nomination <b>—</b> former Massachusetts governor William Weld and former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh.</p>
      <p>Sanford was governor of South Carolina from 2003 to 2011, and served two separate stints in the House of Representatives, but lost a party primary in 2018 after Trump urged voters to back his challenger.</p>
