      <p>I’m sure you love your dog. I know I love my cuddly pooch, Wrigley, so much that I really don’t mind when his wrinkly little face chews a hole through my wallet (figuratively, of course).  I’m not the only 20-something who treats my canine as family; Millennials as a whole are taking dog devotion to new heights. In 2018, the <a href="https://www.mceldrewyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2017-2018-Pet-Survey.pdf">American Pet Products Association reported that Millennials had</a> displaced boomers as the leading owners of dogs, with 38% of all canines residing in Millennial households. While the student-loan burdened generation may lag its predecessors in home buying, marriage and child bearing, it seems to have embraced furry family members—perhaps as a cheaper substitute. </p>
      <p>Cheaper. But not exactly cheap. <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/pet-adoption/dog-adoption/how-much-does-a-dog-cost/">According to PetFinder.com</a>, the routine costs to own a dog run from $395 (think rescue) to as much as $2,455 in the first year, and $326 to nearly $2,000 each year after.  Those totals include food, treats, toys and routine health costs such as vaccines, heartworm and flea prevention, but not the big vet bills if your dog is sick or injured. Nor does that total include such extras as training, groomers or dog walkers.</p>
      <p>As someone who lives in New York City, undeniably one of the most expensive cities in the country, people always ask me, “How can you afford to take care of him <i>and </i>live there?” It’s not as difficult as some might think.</p>
      <p>Here are ways to save on taking care of Fido, no matter where you live.</p>
      <h3>Adopt, Don’t Shop</h3>
      <p>If you don’t have a pet yet, but intend on obtaining one soon, you should seriously consider adoption. Not only is it an ethical choice to make—<a href="https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics">approximately 6.5 million animals end up in shelters in the U.S. each year</a> and are at risk of euthanization, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)— but most of the time, shelters will offer steep discounts on immunizations and the spaying or neutering of puppies.</p>
      <p>The ASPCA also lists national organizations that can provide financial assistance to pet owners in need. These foundations and organizations can help with specific illnesses, or provide low or no-cost spay/neutering. <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/are-you-having-trouble-affording-your-pet">Read more on the ASPCA’s website here</a>. </p>
      <p>I got Wrigley as a puppy from the Humane Society of Tampa Bay and he was already neutered. Shelters operate independently from each other and from the National Humane Society organization, so this isn’t a standard practice across the board; however, a spokesperson for the Humane Society did confirm that it’s a common one. </p>
      <p>By contrast, buying a French Bulldog (currently the most popular dog breed in New York City <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/most-popular-dog-breeds-by-city/">according to the American Kennel Club</a>) as a puppy, from a reputable breeder, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiesola/2016/04/06/french-bulldog-puppies-inside-the-business-of-breeding-new-yorks-most-fashionable-dog/#f538c6d5284f">can set you back thousands</a>.</p>
      <h3>Get Smart about Pet Insurance</h3>
      <p>One of the first things a cash-strapped pet owner might consider is pet insurance. Older readers need not scoff—this isn’t some new Millennial idea. In fact, pet insurance policies date as far back as 1890 for horses and livestock and 1924 for dogs. Lassie, a beloved famous TV dog, was insured in 1982 and paved the way for the commercialization of pet insurance. The North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA) was later founded in 2007 when the pet health insurance industry began booming and needed universal and professional standards established. </p>
      <p>Similar to health insurance for humans, these policies have a monthly premium and yearly deductible. After an owner pays a certain amount out of pocket, the insurance kicks in and starts covering the costs. These policies can have costly premiums, though. When I was doing an initial search for Wrigley for a top-tier plan, Nationwide quoted me around $123 per month, with a $250 deductible.  I don’t even spend that much on my own health insurance premiums.</p>
      <p>So how can you know when it’s “worth” purchasing a policy? A <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/pet-products/is-pet-insurance-worth-cost/">2016 analysis by Consumer Reports</a> found that the answer depends on the age and health conditions of your pet, as well as the policy provider. Some plans only cover basic things, such as annual exams and accidents. But higher-tier (i.e. more expensive) plans will include coverage for cancer treatments and other chronic illnesses. Consumer Reports concluded its analysis stating that pet insurance is most likely to help with unexpected, large vet bills — but owners won’t always break even on the costs. </p>
      <p>A key consideration: how would you pay for an unexpected veterinary bill of $1,000 or more? Arguably the best way is to  “self-insure” and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/how-to-create-an-emergency-fund/">pay from an emergency fund</a>, or even a special canine emergency fund. (See advice below.) But given that, according to the Federal Reserve, 39% of American households <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.htm">can’t cover an emergency $400 bill without borrowing or hocking something</a>, that may not be realistic in your case. </p>
      <p>So if you’re considering a pet insurance policy, shop around for coverage. There are multiple pet insurance companies available, and quotes can be given online in a matter of minutes. </p>
      <h3>Shop Around for Vet and Care Services</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Just as with pet insurance, shopping around for veterinary and care services can go a long way when it comes to saving on costs. Just because there’s a vet down the street from your apartment doesn’t mean it’s the most cost-effective one. I’ve also learned that just because a vet is in a great area doesn’t necessarily mean it will cost a fortune. </p>
      <p>When I first moved to New York, I researched vets within a mile radius of where I lived and asked for quotes on how much certain services, such as annual wellness exams and routine vaccines, would cost. If your dog is in need of a special procedure—say a surgery to repair a torn ligament—it can also pay to shop around for the best price.</p>
      <p>Other care services, such as dog walking, boarding or daycare, can cost a fortune. In Brooklyn, where I live, a full day of doggy daycare can cost $50. When we first moved here, I treated Wrigley to one day of daycare a week, but quickly realized there were better options. A friend recommended an amazing dog walker who only charges $15 for a 30-minute group walk. We are active in our community and have dog-park friends we see regularly, so Wrigley gets to walk with his friends three times a week, and in the end I save $20 a month, compared to paying for one day a week of daycare.</p>
      <p>If you’re absolutely set on sending your dog to daycare, ask to purchase a certain number of days in advance; most places offer packages that come with a discount. </p>
      <h3>Build a Canine Emergency Fund</h3>
      <p>Just as you might have an emergency fund for yourself, establishing one for your dog can be equally as important (and beneficial). Having a separate account for unexpected vet bills can provide owners a financial cushion in times of distress, and help you avoid the cost of buying pet insurance.</p>
      <p>Fintech apps make it easier than ever to jump-start your savings. Some apps like Qapital and Chime will round up your purchases to the next dollar, and put the difference into a separate account for savings. This isn’t a fully sufficient way to create an emergency account, but it can be a great way to start and boost additional savings. </p>
      <p>To build a bigger emergency account, create automatic transfers from your checking account each month. This can be a set amount of money, or a percentage of your total deposits. Many banks make it easy to set up this automatic transfer online, so check with your financial institution to see if this option is available.</p>

      <h3>CareCredit Can Be a Lifesaver (When Used Responsibly) </h3>
      <p>If you’re still in the process of building your emergency fund, and an emergency happens, you aren’t out of total luck. <a href="https://www.carecredit.com/vetmed/">CareCredit</a>, a healthcare financing credit card, can be a life float for large, unexpected vet bills.</p>
      <p>The card, which can be applied for at your vet with a decision given in a matter of minutes, gives cardholders special financing options on bills of $200 or more for 6, 12, 18 or 24 months, with no interest. So what’s the catch? If the entire balance isn’t paid in full by the end of the financing term, interest will be charged from the original purchase date. As with any form of credit, using this option comes with other risks and challenges, too, such as increasing your debt to income ratio, taking a ding to your<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/fico-score-facts-you-probably-didnt-know/"> credit score</a>, fitting the monthly payments into your budget. </p>
      <h3>Dig for Deals on Treats and Food</h3>
      <p>The good news here is you don’t need a Costco membership to buy your dog’s food or treats in bulk (but that could be a great option, if you already have a membership and particularly if you have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/best/cash-back/#costco_anywhere_visa_card_by_citi">Costco Anywhere Visa credit card</a>, which gives you an additional 2% back on Costco purchases.). </p>
      <p>Here’s where getting strategic with where you buy pet supplies, and how you purchase them, will help you save big. I buy all of Wrigley’s food and treats online, usually through Chewy. Before I fill my shopping cart, I login to Rakuten (formerly known as eBates) and see what pet supplier is offering the best cash back deal. If it’s a place other than Chewy, I’ll compare prices and see where I’ll spend the least amount of money and still get a decent amount of cash back. While writing this article, Bark Shop (owned by Bark Box) had a 7.5% cash back deal going on through Rakuten. I opted to purchase treats through there, but still buy Wrigley’s food through Chewy, which had a 3% cash back deal.</p>
      <p>If you <i>really </i>want to save, you can stack cash back on your pet supplies by making the purchase online with a rewards credit card. For example, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/reviews/citi-double-cash/">Citi Double Cash Card</a> offers 2% cash back on everything. If I had that card and used it on my purchases described above, I would end up getting 9.5% cash back total at Bark Shop and 5% cash back at Chewy. </p>
