      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/western-digital/"><b>Western Digital’s</b></a> (NASDAQ: WDC) total revenue has dropped from $20.65 billion in 2018 to $16.57 billion in 2019, on the back of a supply glut in the memory market. Also, a drop in electronics demand has affected client devices revenue, but we expect electronics demand to get back on track going into 2021. A shift toward streaming services and cloud storage has dragged down external storage demand, and we expect client solutions revenue to remain under pressure due to this. However, a rise in enterprise demand can help support Western Digital’s total revenue, driving it up to $17.66 billion by 2021.</p>

      <p>
        <i>A] Client Devices Revenue to grow by about $220 million by 2021, and make up about 47% of total revenue</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This segment includes revenue from the sale of internal storage units for PCs, laptops, and other entertainment devices.</li>
        <li>A drop in demand for PCs and laptops has led to a YoY drop of almost 20% for this segment, with revenue falling to $8.1 billion in 2019.</li>
        <li>We expect the pressure to continue in 2020, but things should get better by 2021, driving client devices revenue to $8.32 billion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>B] Data Center Solutions Revenue to grow by around $770 million over the next 2 years, with its share of total revenue to be around 33%</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This segment caters to the memory requirements of enterprises, and also cloud storage memory solutions.</li>
        <li>Revenue from this segment has dropped almost 17% YoY in 2019, owing to the ongoing memory supply glut that has affected enterprise HDD demand.</li>
        <li>However, we expect enterprise NAND demand to rise, and since cloud storage services are already in high demand, we expect revenue from this segment to grow to about $5.81 billion by 2021.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>C] Client Solutions Revenue to grow by $90 million by 2021, making up the remaining 20% of total revenue</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This segment includes revenue from the sale of external memory devices, sold under the WDC and SanDisk banners.</li>
        <li>Revenue from this segment dropped a whopping 23% YoY, on the back of slowing retail demand.</li>
        <li>Retail demand has been on a steady decline, as more and more people switch to streaming and other cloud storage services.</li>
        <li>We expect this trend to continue, and see no significant growth in revenue from this segment by 2021.</li>
      </ul>
