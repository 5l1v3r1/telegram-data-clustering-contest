      <p>BEIJING (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> confirmed Wednesday that it is holding three Taiwanese on suspicion of committing subversion or other crimes against the Chinese state, part of a trend that has prompted a travel warning from the island’s government.</p>
      <p>The three were suspected of carrying out activities harmful to national security, spokesman for the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ma-xiaoguang/">Ma Xiaoguang</a> told reporters Wednesday. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ma-xiaoguang/">Ma</a> said their cases had already entered the trial stage and their families had been contacted.</p>
      <p>“The mainland side has consistently attacked activities harmful to national security using the law and this is normal law enforcement behavior,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ma-xiaoguang/">Ma</a> said. He denied there had been a particular spike in such cases or that they had been in any way abrupt or unexpected.</p>
      <p>Taiwanese reports have identified the three as Tsai Chin-shu, chairman of an organization promoting exchanges between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a>; Taiwanese democracy activist Lee Meng-chu; and retired professor, Shih Cheng-ping. Tsai and Shih both disappeared last year, while Lee dropped out of sight in August.</p>
      <p>The cases have led to calls for reduced travel to both mainland <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> and the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, which has been shaken by months of violent anti-government protests. A spokeswoman for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a>’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party urged those traveling to pay attention to safety and inform others of their whereabouts at all times.</p>

      <p>Underlying those concerns is a suspicion that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> is detaining more Taiwanese as part of general campaign to isolate and punish the island’s democratically elected President Tsai Ing-wen for refusing to meet Beijing’s demand that she recognize <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> as part of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>.</p>
      <p>The government in September said it has received 149 reports of Taiwanese missing on mainland since Tsai took office in May 2016, with 67 of those still unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>A Taiwanese activist, Lee Ming-che was sentenced to five years in prison in November 2017 on the charge of subversion of state power. His wife, Lee Ching-yu, has complained that Chinese authorities in the southern province of Hunan, where her husband is being held, have repeatedly canceled or postponed prison visits. Lee Ming-che is reportedly in poor health and has lost a considerable amount weight since being incarcerated.</p>
      <p>Tsai’s case has been singled out in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> as particularly worrisome because he was neither a pro-democracy activist nor a support of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a>’s formal independence from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> says he disappeared after checking out of his hotel in the Fujian province city of Quanzhou.</p>

        <p>Also at Wednesday’s briefing, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ma-xiaoguang/">Ma</a> repeated claims that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, an accusation for which Beijing has provided no evidence.</p>
        <p>“What (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a>) should do is immediately retract the ‘black hand’ it has extended to Hong Kong,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ma-xiaoguang/">Ma</a> said, using a term for secret plotting.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> proposes taking control of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taiwan/">Taiwan</a> under the “one country, two systems” framework it has implemented in Hong Kong, though the idea has little support on the island.</p>
