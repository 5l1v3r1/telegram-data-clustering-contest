      <h1>Bicycle Transforms Mid-Ride</h1>

      <p>For those of us who were children in the late 80s and early 90s, we may have dreamed of one day owning a gigantic tractor trailer that could transform into a colossal fighting robot. Or of simply having a toy that could approximate this change from one form into another. As adults, though, we have come to realize that this is wishful thinking. That is, unless we decide to <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Transforming-Bicycle-Tall-Bike-to-Chopper-Bike/">build this transforming bicycle</a>.</p>
      <p>What starts out as a slightly unusual-looking low rider-style bike effortlessly turns into a tall bike by means of a gas cylinder fixed to the bike’s rear triangle. The bike started out as a full suspension mountain bike, but the rear spring was removed to make room for this cylinder. The pivoting action of the rear triangle in a mountain bike is the key design element here: it allows the frame to change shape easily, in this situation when pushed by the cylinder. Adding some longer forks in the front and a coat of paint finishes the build.</p>
      <p>This bike was entered in the Make It Move contest on Instrucables, and has gotten some pretty wide recognition so far. It’s a unique bicycle to be sure, and we’ve seen a few. From <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/28/russian-ebike-goes-everywhere-possibly-legal/">Russian offroad electric utility bicycles</a> to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/06/15/enforce-speed-limits-with-a-rusty-bike/">bicycles that keep drivers from speeding down roads</a>, there have been lots of interesting bike-based builds.</p>
