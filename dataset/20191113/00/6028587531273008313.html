      <p><b>Topline</b>: Top U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor on Wednesday testified that U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told one of his staffers that President Donald Trump cared more about investigating the Bidens than anything else in Ukraine—an opening statement that provides the a clear link between Trump himself and a so-called shadow foreign policy pushed by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The testimony was given during the first public hearing on impeachment.</li>
        <li>Taylor testified last month behind closed doors that Ukrainian military aid was contingent on the country announcing it was investigating the Bidens, but his opening statement Wednesday provides new details about Trump’s personal involvement.</li>
        <li>Taylor said in his opening statement that one of his aides told him he overheard part of a conversation between Sondland and Trump that took place on July 26, a day after the phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of the impeachment inquiry. </li>
        <li>His aide overheard Trump ask about “the investigations,” and then after the call Sondland told Taylor’s staffer “that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.”</li>
        <li>The new details offer a clear picture of how Trump personally was involved in dispatching his staff to carry about a “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/giuliani-pursued-shadow-ukraine-agenda-as-key-foreign-policy-officials-were-sidelined/2019/09/24/ee18aaec-deec-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html">shadow foreign policy</a>” in Ukraine that, first and foremost, focused on the country announcing investigations into his political rivals.</li>
        <li>While significant, Taylor’s testimony isn’t a smoking gun that connects Trump personally with a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Taylor and others have said that Trump restricted military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, for corruption.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Chief critic</b>: Representative Devin Nunes spent his time asking Taylor about a debunked conspiracy theory about how Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Hillary Clinton. </p>
      <p>“Some government officials oppose President Trump’s approach to Ukraine, but many had no idea what concerned him. In this case, it was numerous indications of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election to oppose his campaign and support Hillary Clinton. Once you know that, it’s easy to understand the president’s desire to get to the bottom of this corruption,” he said while questioning Taylor.</p>
      <p><b>What’s next</b>: Ousted Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch will testify Friday. And next week, even <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJNq5p4XUAAXI1T.jpg">more </a>career diplomats will testify, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/05/why-impeachment-observers-are-calling-sondlands-reversal-a-game-changer/#a0fa4f404945">Sondland</a>.</p>
      <p><b>News peg</b>: House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump in response to a phone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. On the July call, Trump directed Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for corruption. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani claim that the reason then-vice president Biden pushed for the resignation of Ukraine’s top prosecutor was to quash an investigation into Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a board seat.</p>
      <p><b>Further reading</b>: Here is the full section of Taylor’s statement referencing his staffer’s conversation with Sondland:</p>
      <p>Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26. While Ambassador Volker and I visited the front, this member of my staff accompanied Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Sondland met with Mr. Yermak.</p>
      <p>Following that meeting, in the presence of my staff at a restaurant, Ambassador Sondland called President Trump and told him of his meetings in Kyiv. The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about “the investigations.” Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.</p>
      <p>Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for. At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it here for completeness. As the Committee knows, I reported this information through counsel to the State Department’s Legal Adviser, as well as to counsel for both the Majority and the Minority on the Committee. It is my understanding that the Committee is following up on this matter.</p>
