        <b>Alcohol consumption in Lithuania is the highest compared to other 43 countries in the world, found the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), also referred to as the «rich-nations club».</b>
      </p>
      <p>The organisation has been studying alcohol consumption in its member states and some other nations since 2000. It compares statistics of the consumption of pure alcohol in its 36 members and eight other countries, including Russia and China.</p>
      <p>Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reports that in Lithuania, people aged 15 and above drank on average 12.3 litres of pure ethanol per year. Austria and France were ranked second and third.</p>
      <h3>The nations with the lowest rates of consumption were Indonesia, Turkey and Israel, with 0.3, 1.4 and 2.6 litres, respectively.</h3>
      <p>Alcohol consumption in Lithuania has been recently going down, but the change has little to do with the government’s restrictions and tax hikes, a study by Vilnius University researchers found in August.</p>
      <p>The Lithuanian government has in the past several years introduced strict restrictions, including hikes in excise duties, raising the legal drinking age, and restricting the selling hours and a total ban on alcohol advertising, LRT reports.</p>
