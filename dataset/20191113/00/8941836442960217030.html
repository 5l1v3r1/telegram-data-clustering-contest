      <p>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — A Vermont middle school is going to join a number of schools across the state by flying a Black Lives Matter flag.</p>
      <p>The Burlington School District reports that the city school board voted unanimously Tuesday to allow the flag to be flown at the Edmunds Middle School.</p>
      <p>The Burlington board’s action came after it received a proposal to fly the flag from the school’s Youth Participatory Action Research Collective.</p>
      <p>Students of color make up 28% of the Edmunds Middle School community.</p>
      <p>The proposal said the flag should be raised each year until there is no longer “a need to bring attention to systemic issues that disproportionately harm students of color.”</p>
