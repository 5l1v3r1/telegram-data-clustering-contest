      <p>Former Spain and FC Barcelona legend David Villa has announced his retirement from soccer. Currently plying his trade in Japan, the 37-year-old revealed his decision in the Far East on Wednesday afternoon after personally calling a press conference.</p>
      <p>‘I wanted to leave football and not let football leave me,’ Villa said. ‘I have been thinking [about it] for years. When you pass a certain age, you know that it can come at any time. I have worked my head and with my people to see that it is not simple. Your body does not warn you. This season has reached me more [than others] in saying that it is time. I can put that motto that I have imposed on myself at risk and it is not a decision of one or two days. It has been discussed with the people who I know and who love me and I've [decided to] take it this year,’ explained Villa.</p>
      <p>Starring at Vissel Kobe with Andres Iniesta, Villa promised to fight for the Emperors Cup for which they have already reached the semi-finals, with a view to lifting his final trophy on January 2nd before calling it a day.</p>
      <p>‘[In] This [next] month and a half we have left, I am very happy to finish by your side,' Villa said to the Barcelona icon, who was in attendance with the rest of their teammates.</p>

      <p>Together, the pair won Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup for Spain. At club level, they were integral part’s of Pep Guardiola’s ‘Tiki-taka’ dynasty and lifted two La Liga titles plus the Champions League alongside one another at the turn of the decade in Blaugrana colours.</p>
      <p>Spending a year at Atletico Madrid in 2013-2014 upon leaving the Camp Nou, Villa then headed to the United States and became New York City FC’s first ever signing later joined by fellow modern-day greats such as Andrea Pirlo. Silverware was not forthcoming in the Bronx, but it was stil a successful stint that yielded 80 goals in 124 appearances.</p>
      <p>Villa's post-playing days after the conclusion of a glittering 19-year career will continue in the Big Apple at the beginning of 2020. More specifically, in the borough of Queens, where he has a stake in Queensboro FC - set to join the USL in 2021 - while claiming to have financial backing.</p>
      <p>‘I lived and played in New York for four years. I know what a special place Queens is,’ explained Villa. ‘I love the cultures, the food, the people and their passion for life and, of course, soccer.’</p>
      <p>‘There’s no other place like it in the world,’ Villa claimed. ‘It’s a dream to help build this football club in Queens and I couldn’t choose a better location.’</p>
      <p>‘We’ve worked for many years on this. The opportunity to start a brand new team in a city like New York, in a borough like Queens, where the people are as passionate about soccer as I am, is huge.’</p>
      <p>‘I'm very happy with my career. I'm very proud. I have loved this sport from the beginning of my life. I have tried to do my best to bring this sport everywhere. And the future now is Queens,’ insisted Villa.</p>
      <p>Putting gathered members of the Japanese press’ minds at rest, Villa clarified his exit from the game was not immediate. ‘I’m not retiring [right away]. I’ll retire on January 2 when we win the Emperors Cup in Tokyo,’ he vowed.</p>
