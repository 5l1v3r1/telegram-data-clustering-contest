      <p><i>He touched student inappropriately while taking measurements<br/></i><br/>A 22-year-old student was sexually harassed after she went to a tailor to get her clothes altered on Sunday evening. The tailor touched her inappropriately on the pretext of taking measurements and misbehaved with her. She complained that he threatened to rape her when she tried to escape from the shop. <br/><br/>The victim, Shubha (name changed), is a native of Odisha and is currently pursuing her Master’s degree in the city. The accused has been identified as Abdul Razak,(in pic) 32, a resident of Jai Bheem Nagar who owns a tailor shop in Madiwala. On Sunday evening at around 6:30 pm, Shubha went to Abdul Razak’s tailor shop to get her dress altered. <br/><br/>Police said that as no one was around, he started misbehaving with her and started making inappropriate comments. <br/><br/>Shubha told the police that Abdul, on the pretext of taking measurements for altering her clothes, started running his hands over her and touching her private parts. He held her hands and pulled her when she pushed him away and tried to escape. “I struggled and ran from the place when he started abusing me and threatened to rape me,” she stated in her complaint. Police said that she was really shocked by the incident and rushed to her PG. She waited for her roommates and then narrated the ordeal to them. On the same night, she along with her roommates, approached the police and filed a complaint against the man. A senior officer said that soon her neighbours heard about it and rushed to his shop. Fearing that the public would thrash him, he immediately shut shop and ran away. <br/><br/>DCP South East, Isha Pant said, “A special team was formed to nab him and based on credible information, the team, on Tuesday secured him from Tamil Nadu. We produced him before the court and sent him to judicial custody.” <br/><br/><br/>Madiwala police have registered a case and booked him under IPC section 354A (Sexual Harassment), 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace).</p>
