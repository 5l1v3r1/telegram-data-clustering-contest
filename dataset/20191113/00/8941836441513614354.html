      <p>FARGO, N.D. (AP) - A man charged in the grisly killings of four people at a North Dakota property management company argued in a filing Wednesday that authorities failed to obtain proper search warrants and evidence should be thrown out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chad-isaak/">Chad Isaak</a>, 45, has pleaded not guilty to four counts of murder in the April 1 shooting and stabbing deaths at RJR Maintenance and Management in Mandan. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chad-isaak/">Isaak</a>, a Washburn chiropractor, lived in a mobile home park managed by the agency. Police have not identified a motive in the killings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chad-isaak/">Isaak</a> argues that law enforcement failed to properly obtain warrants for his home, his business, his truck, his social media accounts and his electronic devices. He says even if the state suspected him of committing the killings, the warrant applications were overbroad and failed to allege specific allegations, therefore lacking probable cause.</p>
      <p>“Suspicion of criminal activity is not probable cause,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chad-isaak/">Isaak</a>’s motion reads.</p>
      <p>Morton County prosecutors did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.</p>

      <p>The attacks began about 7:30 a.m. on April 1, when four employees arrived at work early for their “coffee club” meeting. The victims were RJR co-owner Robert Fakler, 52; employee Adam Fuehrer, 42; and married co-workers Lois Cobb, 45, and William Cobb, 50. A police affidavit says Fakler was stabbed and cut multiple times. Fuehrer and the Cobbs were all stabbed and shot, and Lois Cobb’s neck was cut.</p>
      <p>Robert Fakler’s wife, Jackie, the co-owner of the business, has said she has no clue why the four employees were attacked.</p>
      <p>Police said they found spent shell casings, a knife with a bent tip and gun parts in a kitchen freezer at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chad-isaak/">Isaak</a>’s house, all smelling of chlorine bleach allegedly used to cover up the crimes.</p>

        <p>Defense attorneys in a separate filing asked that his trial be moved from Morton County due to pretrial publicity. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chad-isaak/">Mr. Isaak</a> can hardly enjoy an impartial and fair trial when already convicted by the media as a ‘mass murderer’ to the Morton County public,” the motion reads.</p>
