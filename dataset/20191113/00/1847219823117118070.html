        <b>Estonian ruling coalition has agreed that its Minister of Rural Affairs has to be investigated, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has stated. The current situation is over alleged links to a conflict of interest involving farming subsidies,</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://news.err.ee/1002204/prime-minister-investigation-will-be-launched-into-jarvik-s-activities">Estonian public broadcaster ERR reports</a> on Wednesday, November 13, that Ratas (Centre Party) said a 10-day investigation will be carried out into Mart Järvik’s (EKRE) legal activities. Järvik denies any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>A scandal has put Järvik in spotlight after a conflict of interest was revealed which saw his former advisor, Urmas Arumäe, representing defendants in an EU subsidy fraud case against the Estonian agricultural registers and information board. The institution is subordinate to the Estonian Rural Affairs Ministry.</p>
      <p>Arumäe resigned on Friday, November 12, but opposition parties are maintaining pressure for Järvik to step down.</p>
