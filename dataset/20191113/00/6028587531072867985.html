      <p>New week, new beta, but what's surprising isn't what's new in this week's iOS 13.3 Public Beta 2, but what isn't.</p>
      <h3>What's Fixed</h3>
      <p>I talked last week about how iOS 13.3 Public Beta 1 brought a fix for the multitasking memory leak that was plaguing iOS 13.2. I also theorized that Apple would want iOS 13.3 released as quickly as possible to minimize impact on their users. </p>
      <p>I was more right than I knew.</p>
      <p>Apple ultimately decided to release the fixes found in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2019/11/06/ios-133-public-beta-1-is-no-longer-a-stone-cold-app-killer/">iOS 13.3 Public Beta 1</a> as their own minor point release: iOS 13.2.2. Incidentally, if you're not in the beta program and haven't upgraded to the latest version of iOS 13, you're going to want to take care of that right away.</p>
      <p>What's interesting is that, once again, we've got a bit of an odd upgrade path to get to the latest beta. For iOS 13.3 Public Beta 2 you have to first install a "vanilla" version of iOS 13.3, after which Public Beta 2 is installed. </p>
      <p>The base iOS 13.3 includes the fix released in iOS 13.2.2 and that's the new platform from which development for the real iOS 13.3 is beginning again. </p>
      <h3>What's New</h3>
      <p>With that out of the way, you'd think that there'd be nothing left for Apple's developers to include in iOS 13.3, but you'd be wrong. </p>
      <p>There's new <b>Communication Limits</b> setting under Screen Time. Here, instead of just setting time limits, you can specify who can be contacted, based on your Contacts list. While that may be nigh near impossible if you have a tween (good luck trying to figure who heart emoji, heart emoji, sparkle emoji, unicorn emoji actually is and if you need to block them), it's an important tool to keep your kids safe.</p>
      <p>For Public Beta 2, we're getting some other subtle changes as well.</p>
      <p>Don't like Memojis? Tired of seeing the Memoji keyboard next to your emoji keyboard? Now you can turn it off in <b>Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard</b>. Then toggle the switch next to the <b>Memoji Stickers</b> setting.</p>
      <p>If you use physical security keys to make sure no one can access your stuff but you, you're going to be very happy with iOS 13.3 Public Beta 2. As mentioned in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_ipados_release_notes/ios_ipados_13_3_beta_2_release_notes">official release notes</a>, Safari now supports Lightning, USB, and NFC physical security keys.  </p>
      <h3>What's Broken</h3>
      <p>Still nothing to talk about in the broken column for iOS 13.3, but that can all change with a single release. Stay alert and log any bugs you find. </p>
      <h3>What's Next</h3>
      <p>While Apple might have pushed the multitasking bug out the door, taking some of the pressure off of the time table for the public release of iOS 13.3, they still have the Thanksgiving holiday to contend with. With that only a couple of weeks away, Apple will want to either have iOS 13.3 ready by next week or wait until the first week of December.</p>
      <p>With there being so few actual features in this release, I can't see Apple drawing this out all the way past Thanksgiving. Expect to see a final iOS 13.3 beta build next week, with a full public release the Tuesday before the holiday. </p>
      <p>See you next time! </p>
