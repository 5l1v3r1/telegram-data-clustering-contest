      <p>Operations of two water treatment installations in Surakarta, a city in Central Java, Indonesia have been disrupted by liquor waste pollution in the Bengawan Solo River, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/11/liquor-waste-pollution-bengawan-solo-river-disrupts-water-treatment.html">according to the Jakarta Post</a>.</p>
      <p>Waste from the production of a traditional Javanese alcoholic drink ciu polluted the river, resulting in the death of fish and disrupting the supply of clean water.</p>
      <p>“We cannot process the water because the waste is too thick. It has a murky color and smells like alcohol. We have had to cease operations, which has disrupted the water supply for residents in the area,” <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/11/liquor-waste-pollution-bengawan-solo-river-disrupts-water-treatment.html">said state tap water company Tirta Wening spokesperson Bayu Tunggul</a>. </p>
      <p>The alleged polluter is a factory located next to the Samin Stream, which flows into the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/06/alcohol-waste-turns-javas-longest-river-pitch-black-disrupting-water-supply-in-surakarta.html">Bengawan Solo River</a>. This is the third instance of liquor waste pollution reported in the area.</p>
      <p>Tunggul coordinated with the Sukoharjo Environment Agency and the Central Java Environment Agency to solve the contamination issue.</p>
      <p>The company could take water from the Samin Stream, as it still had sufficient supply, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/11/liquor-waste-pollution-bengawan-solo-river-disrupts-water-treatment.html">according to the Jakarta Post</a>.</p>
      <p>“There is still enough water at the Gajah Mungkur dam. However, as the water is murky, processing it will take time,” Tunggul said. </p>
      <p>The Sukoharjo Pollution Management and Environmental Damage Agency <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/11/liquor-waste-pollution-bengawan-solo-river-disrupts-water-treatment.html">confirmed that the liquor waste indeed originated from the Samin Stream</a>.</p>
      <p>There are plans to build an IPAL in Polokarto to capture waste from liquor producers, but it is in its early stages because the land desired for use is in a green zone, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/11/11/liquor-waste-pollution-bengawan-solo-river-disrupts-water-treatment.html">reported the Jakarta Post</a>.</p>
