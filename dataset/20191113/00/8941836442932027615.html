      <p>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Federal authorities say people in North Carolina turned in more than 38,000 pounds of unwanted or expired drugs for disposal at a drug take-back event held around the state.</p>
      <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day Initiative has operated for a decade to remove unneeded opioids and other dangerous drugs that could be abused if left in people’s homes.</p>
      <p>This year’s event took place on October 26. It also included the collection and disposal of vaping devices and cartridges amid concerns about lung injuries due to vaping.</p>
