      <p><b><a href="https://www.airprotein.com/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Air Protein</a>,</b> a Bay Area-based company, has invented a mind-boggling creation: an air-based meat. <br/><b>The “world’s first</b> air-based meat” is created by transforming elements in the air we breathe into a substance that can be used to make burgers and recreate chicken, as well as other meat products out there. <br/><b>Containing oxygen,</b> nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the powder-like product is then combined with water and mineral nutrients to create the base. <br/><b>With renewable energy</b> and a probiotic production process also known as fermentation, the company converts the elements to create a nutrient-rich protein with an amino acid profile similar to animal protein. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The air-based protein</b> is packed with Vitamin B12 and other crucial vitamins that are often deficient in a vegan diet, likely revolutionizing food production and consumption in the future. <br/><b>Air Protein</b> CEO Lisa Dyson embarked on the experiment after realizing that single-cell organisms are capable of converting carbon dioxide into nutrients. <br/><b>Interested consumers,</b> however, will have to wait a bit before the product finally hits the market, as the company is still working on its tech to produce tangible consumer products. <br/>[via <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/air-protein-launches-air-based-meat/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">CNET</a>, opening image via <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-protein-introduces-the-worlds-first-air-based-food-300955972.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">PR Newswire</a>]</p>
