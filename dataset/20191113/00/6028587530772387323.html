      <p>After the 4-0 victory in der Klassiker against Borussia Dortmund <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/manuelveth/2019/11/09/hansi-flick-to-remain-bayern-munich-coach-after-borussia-dortmund-result/#592759fd79bf">Hansi Flick</a> is expected to remain in charge until next summer at Bayern Munich. But who will take over in the long-term? Pep Guardiola is among the names rumored to take over Bayern Munich next summer.Several outlets in England and Germany reported on Tuesday (Nov. 12) that the Manchester City manager never sold his apartment in Bavaria’s capital and could be enticed to return to Bayern.</p>
      <p>“I'm hearing about it for the first time,” <a href="https://twitter.com/iMiaSanMia/status/1194596451420123138?s=20">Manuel Neuer said to the press on Wednesday</a> (Nov.13) “We'll see what happens and what the bosses will decide. We played two games under Flick, and we were successful. The bosses will comment on that if they want to.”</p>
      <p>At Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola was in charge of 161 games and averaged 2.41 points per game, more than at Barcelona (2.36 points per match in 247 games) and Manchester City (2.37 points per match in 193 games). Furthermore, Guardiola enjoyed his time in Munich. “I will return to Germany at some point—perhaps as a coach,” Guardiola said in 2016.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday (Nov.13)<i>, Sport Bild</i> claimed that Bayern never broke off the contact with the Manchester City coach. The club has registered that Guardiola appears somewhat unhappy in Manchester—his wife and kids have reportedly moved back to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>During his last year in Munich, Guardiola also made the statement that he always regretted his fourth year in Barcelona. Three years at a club are enough—Guardiola is currently in his fourth year at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has, in the past, been adamant, however, that he will stay in Manchester until 2021 when his contract expires at City. Then there is the question of whether Guardiola would be willing to undergo a rebuild at Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>After all, Bayern in 2020 will be a very different club from the team Guardiola took over in 2013. Back in 2013, the club had just won the treble under Jupp Heynckes. The player material was among the best, if not the best in the world.</p>
      <p>Those times, however, are over. Seven years on, and two coaching changes later, the Bayern squad next summer will be in its second stage of a significant rebuild. Guardiola, for the first time in his career, would have to take over a club that will have to get younger.</p>

      <p>Even though Bayern are willing to invest in the region of £100 million for players like Kai Havertz and Leroy Sané, Guardiola would not expend the sort of resources he has currently at his disposal at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Under Guardiola, Manchester City has spent <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.de/manchester-city/alletransfers/verein/281">€777.59 million (£665 million) on new players</a>. In comparison, Bayern Munich has spent just <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.de/fc-bayern-munchen/alletransfers/verein/27">€340 million (£291 million) in the same period</a>. Furthermore, the Bavarians have invested €70 million (£60 million) in a brand-new academy not far from the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>For Guardiola, a move back to Munich would, therefore, mean that he would have to rebuild a club under very different circumstances then it was the case at Manchester City. It would be an exciting challenge for the 48-year-old, but would he be a suitable candidate for a slow rebuild that would also include players from Bayern’s academy?</p>
      <p>That will be the central question the Bayern bosses will have to ask themselves should the option to sign Guardiola materialize. The rebuild and restructuring of the club makes Ajax head coach Erik ten Hag the favorite to take over next summer—ahead of Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel, who like Guardiola would demand significant investments in the squad.</p>

      <p>The 49-year-old guided a young and exciting Ajax side to the Champions League semifinal last season. Furthermore, Ten Hag coached Bayern’s amateur team from 2013 to 2015, speaks German and like Guardiola, and Louis van Gaal before him believes in possession football.</p>
      <p>Ten Hag, without a doubt, would slip into the Bayern role without demands of the sort of investments experienced by Manchester City during the Guardiola reign. That, however, does not mean that Bayern would forego the opportunity to bring back Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich’s ambitions are to be among the top three clubs on the planet, despite not being a heavy spender on the transfer market. Bringing in a coach like Guardiola would underline the club’s ambitions to return to the years of dominance in the Bundesliga and win the Champions League for the seventh time in the club’s history.</p>
