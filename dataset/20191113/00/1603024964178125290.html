      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 stock index eked out a slim gain on Tuesday as President Donald Trump said the United States is close to signing an initial trade deal with China but offered no new details about negotiations.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs during trading but stocks ended off session highs after a highly anticipated midday speech from Trump, with investors concerned ahead of time about any comments that would worsen the tariff dispute that has convulsed markets for more than a year.</p>
      <p>Trump said US and Chinese negotiators were “close” to a “phase one” trade deal, but largely repeated well-worn rhetoric about China’s “cheating” on trade in remarks at The Economic Club of New York.</p>

      <p>“People were hoping to get a little bit more clarity on the trade front and that doesn’t seem to have been the case,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.</p>
      <p>Investors have pointed to US-China trade tensions as the main market uncertainty as stocks have climbed to record levels, fuelled by rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, third-quarter earnings coming in above low expectations, and signs the economy may be bottoming.</p>
      <p>Still, Carlson said, “the market to some extent is starting to try not to be too reactive one way or the other to what the president is saying about trade.”</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained unchanged at 27,691.49, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.83 points, or 0.16%, to 3,091.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.81 points, or 0.26%, to 8,486.09.</p>
      <p>Most S&amp;P 500 sectors finished in positive territory, with healthcare the top gainer. Real estate .SPLRCR lagged the most, falling 0.8%.</p>
      <p>Among stocks, Walt Disney Co rose 1.3% as the company said demand for its much-anticipated streaming service, Disney+, was well above its expectations in a launch.</p>
      <p>Shares of Netflix Inc fell 0.7%.</p>
      <p>Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N) shares jumped 10.5% after the U.S. factory equipment maker easily beat quarterly results and forecast 2020 earnings above estimates.</p>
      <p>CBS Corp shares dropped 3.6% after the media company missed quarterly revenue estimates. Shares of Viacom Inc which is merging with CBS, slid 3.8%.</p>
      <p>With third-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, about three-quarters of S&amp;P 500 companies have topped profit estimates, but overall they are expected to have posted a 0.5% drop in earnings, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Earnings from big firms including Walmart Inc, Nvidia Corp and Cisco Systems Inc as well as a fresh set of economic data, are due this week.</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, the ratio was roughly even.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 109 new highs and 104 new lows.</p>
      <p>About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, just below the 6.8 billion-share daily average over the last 20 sessions.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
