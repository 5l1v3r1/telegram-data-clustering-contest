      <p>Across America, girls with ethnic hair types are being <a href="https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fnbcblk%2Fwhen-hair-breaks-rules-some-black-children-are-getting-trouble-n973346&amp;data=02%7C01%7CAdam.Bricault%40edelman.com%7Cf6faa9707e8245da256908d73d019968%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637044949402533278&amp;sdata=8lU5WHvJRZc%2FXQljCAKeO2xOiOYnF%2B5MXNT3EJrk85U%3D&amp;reserved=0">unfairly policed</a> for the way they wear their hair – even being dismissed from school and sent home because it’s “distracting.” Shonda Rhimes and Dove are leading the charge to brings real girls, administrators, and policymakers together in the fight against hair discrimination.Dove specifically conducted research around the discrimination that happens to young black girls. They found that black girls hear criticism about their appearance as young as 8 years old, with most comments centered on hair. Not only does this unfair scrutiny shape their self-image, but the narrative that natural hair is unprofessional puts black girls at an educational disadvantage and later can hold them back in their careers. Dove also <a href="https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/campaigns/the-crown-act.html">found</a> that a black woman is 80% more likely to change her natural hair to meet social norms or expectations at work and 50% more likely to be sent home or know of a black woman sent home from the workplace because of her hair.</p>
      <p>What is even more shocking is that hair discrimination has been legal in all 50 states. Dove co-founded the CROWN (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Coalition in partnership with the National Urban League, Color Of Change, and Western Center on Law and Poverty. The mission is to advance efforts to end hair discrimination and to create a more equitable and inclusive beauty experience for black women and girls. Through their efforts hair discrimination is now illegal in the states of California and New York. Dove and the CROWN Coalition along with Rhimes are continuing to help make hair discrimination illegal across the country through this signed <a href="https://campaigns.organizefor.org/petitions/help-make-hair-discrimination-illegal">petition</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Yola Robert: </b>Why was it important for you get behind Dove and The Crown Coalition?</p>
      <p><b>Shonda Rhimes:</b> It seems every day there is a new headline about a girl being sent home from school because her braids defy some archaic dress code or you may read about a student athlete being forced to cut his locks in order to play. I can’t imagine how damaging it feels to be punished simply because of the way you choose to wear your hair. It’s time to put an end to hair discrimination and that long-lasting effects it can have on a girls’ self-esteem. I’m proud to stand with Dove and the CROWN Coalition, who are leading the charge and bringing anti-hair discrimination legislation to states around the country. </p>
      <p><b>Robert: </b>Have you ever experienced hair discrimination?</p>
      <p><b>Rhimes:</b> I’ve not personally experienced hair discrimination, but I try really hard to make sure that my daughters know who they are and that they understand their beauty. It’s tough out there now. Kids are bombarded with images in ways that we never were. I’m trying to create a world in which my daughters are seeing images of themselves as much as possible—in the books they read, in the dolls they play with. That’s important—the images they are allowed to see. They need to see those images regularly and know that they are beautiful. </p>
      <p> <b>Robert: </b>How are you using your influence in Hollywood and in the media to change the culture around hair discrimination? How have you seen your influence change Hollywood?</p>
      <p><b>Rhimes:</b> I started working with Dove a couple of years ago because we had a shared mission in ensuring that media and culture truly reflect women and girls as they are in real-life. That has always been important to me, especially when it comes to the diversity of images that young girls see and how women are represented. We all know that the media is responsible for pushing very limited images of what is perceived as beautiful. In my work, whether it’s been Grey’s Anatomy or Scandal, I’ve always tried to stay true to what the world looks like and offer a real representation of the world. I want the next generation to see all types of beauty and I hope they feel seen in characters like Olivia Pope and Annalise Keating, so that they don’t feel invisible or that they don’t measure up. I do think there has been some change in recent years, but there is always work to be done. </p>
      <p><b>Robert: </b>What can people do in the workplace or at school to help stop discrimination against hair?</p>
      <p><b>Rhimes:</b> I do believe that we all have the power to create change. Sometimes, it’s not enough to simply take an action yourself – we have to get others involved to create a movement. We have to use our voices and spread the word. I started by signing the CROWN Act petition to bring anti-hair discrimination legislation to more states around the country – and everyone reading this can do the same at <a href="http://dove.com/crown">dove.com/crown</a>.</p>
