      <h1>General Election 2019: Labour pledges to close gender pay gap by 2030</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:14+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Catherine Neilan</a></address>
      <p>Labour will today pledge to close the gender pay gap by 2030, as part of its ongoing commitment to women in the workplace.</p>
      <p>Shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock and shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler will use Thursday’s Equal Pay Day – the day when women effectively stop getting paid compared to their male counterparts – to highlight Labour’s women-friendly policies.</p>
      <p>They include plans to force small and mid-size companies to obtain government certification on gender equality or face further auditing and fines, as well as increasing statutory maternity pay to a full year.</p>
      <p>Labour is also seeking to introduce a real living wage of £10 an hour, roll out sectoral collective bargaining to raise the floor on pay across entire sectors and require large employers to introduce a menopause workplace policy.</p>
      <p>Next year marks 50 years since the Equal Pay Act, but the mean gender pay gap for full-time work stands at 13.1 per cent. According to the Fawcett Society, at the current rate, it will take another 60 years to close.</p>
      <p>Pidcock will say: “For far too long the interests of working women have been at the bottom of the list of priorities for government.</p>
      <p>“Labour in government will be uncompromising in tackling the structural barriers that is holding so many women back.”</p>
      <p>Butler will add: “It’s not good enough that under the current government’s plans, it will take another 60 years to close the gender pay gap.</p>
      <p>“Labour’s real living wage, robust gender pay auditing – including fining organisations that fail to take action, will help us deliver real change and meet this ambitious target.”</p>
      <p>But the policies – <a href="https://www.cityam.com/general-election-2019-labour-promises-workplace-revolution/">which have already been attacked by think tanks such as the Institute for Economic Affairs</a> – received renewed criticism.</p>
      <p>Dominie Moss, founder of women-focused executive recruitment firm The Return Hub, said: “While it’s good to see some robust policy ideas such as fines and auditing for non-compliant firms, this timeline is completely unrealistic.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t address the cultural and structural problems that undermine female progression in the workplace. Women have to climb so many unseen hurdles throughout their career, that men simply don’t come across.  </p>
      <p>“A realistic, long term solution needs to review how women are recruited, promoted and retained at mid and senior career points. The system needs a serious shake up, quickly, to get anywhere near this target by 2030.”</p>
