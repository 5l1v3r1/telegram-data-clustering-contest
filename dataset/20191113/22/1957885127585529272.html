      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 13 November 2019</p>
      <p>We've not even been graced with Season One of Netflix's live-action take on Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher novels yet, but already the series has been renewed for a second season.</p>
      <p>The news comes directly from showrunner Lauren Hissrich, who <a href="https://twitter.com/LHissrich/status/1194662006734897159?s=20">revealed on Twitter</a> earlier today that "Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri will be back for more adventures... in Season Two."</p>
      <p>"I could not be more proud of what the amazing cast and crew of The Witcher have accomplished," Hissrich continued, "and can't wait for the world to dig in and enjoy these stories with us."</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-witcher-renewed-season-2-netflix-1203403503/">Variety</a>, The Witcher's second season will, like the first, consists of eight episodes. It's due to begin production in London early next year for release in 2021.</p>
      <p>Season One of The Witcher - which stars Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, Anya Chalotra as Yennefer, and Freya Allan as Ceri - comes to Netflix on 20th December this year.</p>
      <p>You can get a taste of what's in-store for Geralt and chums in the official trailer above - which reassuringly remembers to add a bit of bathtub alongside all the monster bopping.</p>
