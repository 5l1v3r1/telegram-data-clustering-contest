      <h1>Windows 10 will soon stop support WEP WIFI encryption</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:56:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Of the number of technologies <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/planning/windows-10-deprecated-features">Microsoft will start deprecating in Windows 10</a>, one familiar name is WEP WIFI encryption.</p>
      <p>Since the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-may-2019-update1903-is-ready-for-broad-deployment-microsoft/">May 2019 Update</a>, Windows 10 has been showing a warning when users connect to WIFI networks secured via WEP or TKIP warning users that these protocols are now easily hacked.</p>
      <p>Microsoft warns that in future releases Windows 10 will simply refuse to connect to such networks.</p>
      <p>Microsoft recommends users switch their legacy routers to those which support AES ciphers, available with WPA2 or WPA3.</p>
      <p>WEP dates all the way back to 1997 and was the only encryption protocol available to 802.11a and 802.11b devices. It was fully cracked in 2001, with only 1 minute of packet collection needed to expose the encryption key.</p>
      <p>Suffice to say if you are still using WEP its about high time that you replace your hardware, and Windows 10 will soon help nudge you along that way.</p>
