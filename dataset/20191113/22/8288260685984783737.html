      <p>Former Birmingham City boss Steve Cotterill has emerged as a contender for the vacant manager's job at Hearts.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old is to be interviewed for the post, according to the <a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/latest-hearts-news/hearts-hold-talks-ex-birmingham-manager-steve-cotterill-plus-latest-felix-magath-and-stephen-robinson-996260">Edinburgh Evening News</a> .</p>
