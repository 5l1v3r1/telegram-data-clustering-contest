      <p>Jade Jagger has said it is “a hindrance” having such famous parents.</p>
      <p>The jewellery designer, 48, is the daughter of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and fashion icon Bianca Jagger.</p>
      <p>She said it can be “demoralising” when people assume any success is down to her family.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the Harper’s Bazaar At Work Summit, she said: “I mean it is a hindrance, yesterday I was Googling something and I found an awful, tragic piece about me in the newspaper from last year saying that ‘she just can do whatever she wants’.</p>
      <p>“It’s very demoralising after you’ve worked all your life to try to achieve something.</p>
      <p>“But also, obviously, seeing what my family have done always makes you look up to something higher that is almost unachievable.</p>
      <p>“I try to bring myself down from thinking that’s my goal because I think that can leave you with heartache because I’m certainly not going to be jumping around on stage in the pouring rain … I have my limits.”</p>
