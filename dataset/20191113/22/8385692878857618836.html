      <h1>Yep, Disney+ Even Works On Android TV's Forgotten Razer Forge TV</h1>

      <p>Disney+ has finally arrived and with it came support for a whole range of devices, including Android TV.</p>
      <p>Even the Android TV platform itself is extremely well supported. Something that's often not the case when a new video service launches.</p>
      <p>In fact, the problem doesn't end there either. Existing video services also often fail to support Android TV in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The modern version of the Hulu app didn't <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/08/download-latest-hulu-android-tv-app-with-live-tv.html">arrive on Android TV</a> until earlier this year. Likewise, Prime Video only recently <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/07/prime-video-for-android-tv-live.html">became widely available</a>, and AT&amp;T TV NOW is still largely AWOL.</p>
      <p>If you're in doubt of just how wide Disney+'s Android TV support is, then look no further than the Razer Forge TV.</p>
      <h3>History's forgotten Android TV device</h3>
      <p>The Razer Forge TV was <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/01/razers-ces-2015-round-up-the-forge-android-tv-box-the-simpler-nabu-x-and-open-source-virtual-reality.html">announced and launched</a> in early 2015. At the time, it was sort of positioned as a gaming Android TV device.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, shortly afterwards NVIDIA entered the Android TV space with its first SHIELD TV device.</p>
      <p>With the NVIDIA SHIELD also positioned as a gaming device, and the one that flew off store shelves, the Razer Forge TV never really settled itself in the market. Or for that matter, in the consumer psyche.</p>
      <p>While the NVIDIA SHIELD, the Nexus Player, and the Xiaomi Mi Box have all enjoyed long lives, the Razer Forge TV quickly became history's forgotten Android TV device.</p>

      <h3>Own Razer Forge TV? Then download Disney+</h3>
      <p>Of course, if you happen to own a Razer Forge TV then it's probably less of a forgotten device. Although even to some owners, it will be just as forgotten.</p>
      <p>While we don't have the device on hand, at least one owner has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/dvd1d2/disney_works_on_razer_forge/">confirmed</a> the device's app support after they "<i>dusted off" </i>their Forge TV.</p>
      <p>What makes the app support all the more surprising is that the same user also notes how the device won't even run Netflix.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The user reports the Disney+ app works as expected, with the one caveat being that video is resigned to 1080p. Still, that's not a bad compromise if this is the only Android TV device you have lying around.</p>
      <p>For reference, there was no sideloading involved. The Disney+ app was downloaded to the Forge TV directly from the Google Play Store.</p>
      <h3>Disney+ doing right by Android TV</h3>
      <p>Officially, Disney only lists TVs by Sharp and Sony, as well as the NVIDIA SHIELD TV and Mi Box set-top boxes as compatible Android TV products.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, Disney has also confirmed the Android TV support dates as far back as Android 5.0. For reference, that's Lollipop and the very Android version that Android TV first launched with.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, you might find it difficult to find any Android TV device (current or discontinued) that you can't watch <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/beey9">Disney+</a> on.</p>
      <p>Let the hunt begin.</p>
