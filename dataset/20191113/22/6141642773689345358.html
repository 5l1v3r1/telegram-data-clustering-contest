      <p>Gareth Southgate will recall Raheem Sterling for England’s game in Kosovo despite suspecting the forward has the hump with him after being axed for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Only a point is needed against the Group A minnows to secure qualification for the finals and Thursday’s encounter at Wembley will also see the Three Lions celebrate becoming the first nation to play 1,000 international matches.</p>
      <p>Much of the talk, however, has focused on a fracas rather than football in the build-up following Sterling’s exchange with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez less than 24 hours after the pair clashed towards the end of Manchester City’s 3-1 loss at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The Football Association announced late on Monday night that the 24-year-old would not be considered to face Montenegro as a result, with the forward making private and public apologies after emotions got the better of him.</p>

      <p>While Southgate feels it may have caused a temporary rift in his relationship with Sterling, he insists he is ready to restore one of his key men in the final qualifier in Prishtina on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” Southgate replied when asked if he would be ready to turn to Sterling in Kosovo. “Without knowing what might happen in tomorrow’s game and everything else, but I can see it.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he had any hesitation in making such a decision, he added: “None, none whatsoever.</p>
      <p>“As I have said, we take the decision and drew a line under everything. We move forward now, the way he’s trained has been exemplary, so that’s it.”</p>
      <p>Southgate attempted to clear up the matter in a hastily-organised press conference on Tuesday but was still fielding questions about Sterling on the eve of their final home Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <blockquote>I wouldn't imagine that he's hugely enthusiastic (about me).<cite>Gareth Southgate</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“As a player, my relationship with my managers and how I felt about them changed day to day, and there were many occasions when I had the hump with them, usually when I wasn’t in the team,” the 57-cap former defender said.</p>
      <p>“So I understand that, I hope that time takes its course on those things. As a manager you hope that you bring lots of good moments for players, there are those occasions where you give them their debut, you give them the chance to play.</p>
      <p>“But there are inevitably occasions when you don’t start them, where you have to take them off, and that will always be the landscape.</p>
      <p>“I hope that all of my players know that, first and foremost, I care about them, that I want to be fair with them, that I want to do what’s right for all of them, and that they can lean on me when they need me.</p>
      <p>“And I also accept that, at times, they’re not going to be bouncing with joy when they see my face walking through the meal room.</p>

      <p>Asked if it was fair to say that Sterling had the hump with him, Southgate said: “Well, I wouldn’t imagine that he’s hugely enthusiastic (about me), but I can understand that and, in the end, he’s with the group, that’s the most important thing.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know that (he has the hump with me) for sure. You don’t have to be an expert in human behaviour to think it was possible.</p>
      <p>“His reaction has been brilliant. He spoke to the team really well and he’s trained really well and I can’t fault his reaction at all.”</p>
