      <p>Durban – Following a whirlwind couple of years travelling the globe playing T20 cricket, a period of downtime for master blaster <b>Dave Miller</b> has refreshed his mind and body as he and the Durban Heat line up an assault on the <b>Mzansi Super League 2.0</b>.</p>
      <p>With so much cricket under his belt in 2019 already including a World Cup, an Indian Premier League and an international tour to India, Miller felt that he needed to take some time away from the game to refocus and re-energise himself.</p>
      <p>“I have taken some time off over the last couple of months,” Miller said. “I have been in the Kruger (National Park) recently to just get away from the demands of the game.</p>
      <p>“It’s really important to look after your mental state during your career and it is something that moving forward I am going to pay a lot more attention to.</p>
      <p>“Cricket is a sport that so much can go against you that you need to have time to reflect.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I still have a lot of years left playing cricket but I want to make sure that I look after myself mentally.”</p>
      <p>The first edition of the competition was not a good one for the Durban Heat or for Miller and the talented left-hander will hope that he can put that right in the second edition of the T20 competition.</p>
      <p>“As you move on in your career the people you play against work you out.</p>
      <p>“So it is important that you as a player keep adapting and adding to your own game. This is something that I am aware of and I am working on it.</p>
      <p>“Also the mental shift of being open to being adaptable is important and that helps when you are concentrating on improving your weaknesses.”</p>
      <p>Following the rained out game against the Tshwane Spartans, the Durban Heat has two home games this weekend with a showdown against the Paarl Rocks on Friday evening and then a match-up against the Cape Town Blitz at Kingsmead Stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Obviously you want to get off to the best possible start but for us we want to develop a formula that works for us.</p>
      <p>“It’s also important that we work out the other teams but we want to make sure that we have our bases covered and are playing to our strengths first.</p>
      <p>“If we get our blueprint right then we can expose teams. If you add up all the little things then the result should take care of itself.”</p>
