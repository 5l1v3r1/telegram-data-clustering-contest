      <h2>England lost 2-1 to Croatia after extra-time in their first World Cup semi-final appearance since 1990 but Maguire believes his side are stronger for the experience</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Maguire says England have learned painful lessons in time for their homecoming tournament.</p>
      <p>England boss Gareth Southgate’s men can clinch qualification for Euro 2020 against Montenegro on Thursday and suddenly then next summer will feel much closer.</p>
      <p>It is a glorious opportunity as Wembley will host Group matches and also the semi finals and final to give England a huge advantage.</p>
      <p>And reaching the semi finals of last year’s World Cup will certainly give the whole nation belief and Maguire says what happened in Russia will put them in good stead, especially when it comes to game management.</p>
      <p>England were just 45 minutes from a place in the World Cup final when they blew a half time lead against Croatia and Maguire says they will not make the same mistake again.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> defender Maguire said: “Yes, it gives us great belief and it gives us another big game experience as well, being at the World Cup, and handling different situations in big tournaments.</p>
      <p>“So, for example in the semi-final, we probably could have handled it a little bit better when we went ahead. But we can take those experiences into future tournaments.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a great tournament, the Euros, and that’s why we are putting our full focus on the qualifying and we want to make sure we get there and tomorrow night there is no better game to do it in.</p>
      <p>“Game management in terms of when we were leading the game but we could have done things better. It was a while ago now, but it still on my mind. It was difficult to lose the game.</p>
      <p>“But no, we’ll learn from the World Cup, so it was a great experience for us all, and now we’re fully focused on qualifying for the Euros and then it’s going to be a great occasion, as like you say, but a lot of games will be at Wembley.</p>

      <p>“It would be really special to play in a major tournament and walking out at Wembley would be something that you dream of. People say it would give us a little advantage as well.</p>
      <p>“We know that the crowd get right behind us at Wembley and the support over the last few years - especially since I’ve been playing - has been unbelievable. Like you say, it’s a big game tomorrow night and one that we're all looking forward to and we feel prepared for.”</p>
