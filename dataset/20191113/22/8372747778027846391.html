      <p>The California Public Utilities Commission voted Wednesday to open an investigation into pre-emptive power outages that blacked out large parts of the state for much of October as strong winds sparked fears of wildfires.</p>
      <p>The decision came after hearing from the public on the many hardships the blackouts caused for residents.</p>
      <p>The state's largest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., initiated multiple rounds of shut-offs and plunged nearly 2-point-5 million people into darkness throughout northern and central California.</p>
      <p>Some of the outages lasted for several days.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E officials insisted on the shut-offs for public safety, but infuriated residents and a parade of public officials.</p>
      <p>Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric also shut off power but to far fewer people.</p>
      <p>The outages raised concerns about whether the utilities properly balanced the need to provide reliable service with public safety and were properly planned and executed.</p>
      <p>CPUC President Marybel Batjer ordered the investigation last month and the five-member commission gave its approval given the public frustration.</p>
      <p>The outages were astonishing for a state that is one of the economic powerhouses in the world.</p>
      <p>People made frantic dashes for cash and gas as businesses watched their goods spoil.</p>
      <p>Some elderly and disabled people were trapped in their apartments with elevators out of service.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E initiated five rounds of blackouts, with the smallest affecting about 30,000 people and the largest affecting nearly 2.5 million.</p>
      <p>Residents in San Francisco suburbs and in Northern California wine country were without power for days.</p>
      <p>Bill Johnson, CEO of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, said the outages were the right call and kept people safe, although a transmission line in Sonoma County that was not powered off malfunctioned minutes before a wildfire erupted last month, forcing about 180 thousand people to evacuate.</p>
      <p>The company is in bankruptcy and faces 30 billion dollars in liabilities after its equipment was found to have started several deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018, including the year-old Camp Fire that killed 85 in Paradise.</p>
