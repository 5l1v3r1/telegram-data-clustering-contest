      <p>Natalie Corwin, CEO of Pet Community Centre and board member at Turnip Green Creative Reuse in Nashville, urged the band’s followers to get planting at a special event in New Orleans on November 26.</p>
      <p>In a message, which was shared by frontman <a href="https://www.nme.com/matty-healy">Matty Healy</a>, she wrote: “Fans of @the1975 unite! Let’s plant trees to honour our favourite band and what they stand for. Let’s plant a future! Join us Nov 26 in New Orleans or sponsor a tree if you can’t be there in person!”</p>

      <p>Healy also wrote in a message to his fans: “People are starting to set these up and it’s THE COOLEST THING EVER.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/1975s-matty-healy-greta-thunberg-punk-person-ive-ever-met-2551245">It comes after the frontman recently praised the spirit of climate activist Greta Thunberg, hailing her “the most punk person he’s ever met”</a>. The 16-year-old has become <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/met-protesters-marching-londons-global-climate-strike-2550061">a global figurehead of ongoing protests to fight climate change</a>, making headlines with her <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/greta-thunberg-full-speech-to-the-un-2019-climate-change-summit-2550824">rousing speech to the UN in September</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Healy has <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/1975s-matty-healy-supports-teenager-facing-16-years-jail-not-wearing-veil-2566973">voiced his support for a teenager who is currently facing 16 years in prison in Iran</a>.</p>
      <p>In a new post on Instagram that has been re-shared by Amnesty International, he said: “It was International Women’s Day 2019 when Yasaman [Aryanı] and her mother took off their headscarves and walked through a women-only train carriage in Tehran, handing out flowers.</p>
      <p>“Yasaman’s cruel punishment is part of a wider crackdown on women campaigning against discriminatory forced veiling laws in Iran. The Iranian authorities must not be allowed to rob Yasaman of the best years of her life – simply because she believes women should have the right to choose what they wear.”</p>
