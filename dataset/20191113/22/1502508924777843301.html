      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:11:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/us-government">US government </a>recorded a $134 billion budget deficit in October, the first month of the new fiscal year, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>That compared to a budget deficit of $100 billion in the same month last year, according to the Treasury's monthly budget statement.</p>
      <p>Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a $133 billion deficit for the month.</p>
      <p>Unadjusted receipts last month totalled $246 billion, down 3% from October 2018, while unadjusted outlays were $380 billion, a rise of 8% from the same month a year earlier.</p>
      <p>The U.S. government's fiscal year ends in September each year. Fiscal year 2019 saw a widening in the deficit to $984 billion, the largest budget deficit in seven years, a result of the Trump administration's decision to cut taxes and increase government spending.</p>
      <p>Those figures reflected the second full budget year under U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, and a time when the country had an expanding tax base with moderate economic growth and an unemployment rate near a 50-year low.</p>
      <p>When adjusted for calendar effects, the deficit for October remained at $134 billion compared with an adjusted deficit of $113 billion in October 2018.</p>
