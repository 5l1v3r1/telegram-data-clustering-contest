      <h1>Netflix partners with Nickelodeon to produce shows based on existing IP</h1>
      <h2>Hope they work on that Danny Phantom reboot</h2>

      <p>In an odd turn of events, Nickelodeon has signed a multi-year deal to produce new content for Netflix. The deal likely has something to do with<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-canada-now-available-everything-you-need-to-know/"> Disney+’s recent launch.</a></p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://thenextweb.com/video/2019/11/13/netflix-partners-with-nickelodeon-disney-plus/">Thenextweb</a>, </i>the companies will work together to produce content based on already existing shows, which isn’t a shock, as earlier in 2019, Netflix produced a film based on the 1992 series <i>Rocko’s Modern Life. </i>The streaming service did the same thing with <i>Invader Zim </i>and is also working on a live-action <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> series.</p>
      <p>Disney+ has already garnered more than 10 million subscribers. While neither Netflix nor Nickelodeon mentioned the Micky Mouse company, they’re likely feeling the heat, especially considering how vast the Disney+ library is with hit animated series like <i>Disney’s Recess, Phineas and Ferb </i>and <i>Gravity Falls</i>.</p>
      <p>Nickelodeon, a TV network that caters to kids, will need some help if it wants to compete with the likes of Disney+. Netflix seems like a good choice for the network, but Nickelodeon’s parent company, Viacom, is in the process of merging with CBS, which has its own streaming service called <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/07/05/cbs-all-access-android-tv-canada/">CBS All Access</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s still unclear when Netflix will start producing more Nickelodeon shows, but hopefully, this means we’ll soon get a new series that focuses on Sandra ‘Sandy’ Cheeks on Netflix.</p>
