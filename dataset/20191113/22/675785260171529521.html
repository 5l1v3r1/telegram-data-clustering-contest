      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/emily-atack">Emily Atack</a> has tipped Jacqueline Jossa to go on an emotional jungle journey like hers in camp this year.</p>
      <p>Actress and TV host Emily, 29, finished second to Harry Redknapp on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> last year and won fans over with her honesty about being unlucky in love and a lack of confidence.</p>
      <p>She thinks former EastEnders actress Jaqueline could also benefit from viewers seeing the real her instead of a soap character.</p>
      <p>Emily said: “I’m really supportive of Jacqueline Jossa, I think we’re a similar age and she’s been through quite a lot, I think she could really find some positives. So we’re rooting for her.</p>
      <p>"You have to be going in there for the right reasons, for yourself and for your life. That's very deep. I do get very deep sometimes!"</p>

      <p>Speaking before going onto the show, Jaqueline admitted earlier this week she wants to change people's perception of her, with her husband Dan Osbourne hit by a series of allegations involving other women in the past.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said: “I think people think I am a pushover or a doormat. I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best.”</p>
      <p>Emily Atack is back in the jungle this year to present ITV2 spin off show Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>Her ITV2 co-host Joel Dommett says he thinks Caitlyn Jenner will do well despite being 70 – but will also get picked on by the public.</p>

      <p>He said: “I think she will get stuck in because she did the American version as Bruce so she is the only person who has ever done it twice apart from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> . Having that weird insight into it and the landscape. I Googled it and tried to watch but it was so long ago there is not much trace of it.</p>
      <p>I think she is going to be great and I am really excited how everyone reacts to her and how she reacts to them.</p>
      <p>“Inevitably she is going to get voted to do a lot of trials early on because that usually happens and then others will take the mantle but I genuinely think there is a lot of strong people in camp this year. Last year you thought last year Anne might be weak in terms of trials, this year I don't feel like there is anyone who is going to say 'I'm A Celebrity get me out of here'. They are all strong minded. Especially Caitlyn because she used to be an Olympian and is fit and healthy.”</p>

      <p>And added there is no place to hide on the show and no point trying to fake it to win.</p>
      <p>He said: “I think you've just got to be yourself. And it's amazing with the show, the beauty of it compared to other reality shows, is that it strips away everything that you're used to in your normal life. The phones, the make up, the hunger, the availability of food. It strips away all of that, so you can't pretend to be someone else for three weeks. You cannot do it. You see people trying to pretend but you see through it so easily. It's like we are basically living with them for three weeks, everyone watching the show. You can't get away with a falsehood. Just be yourself, if you're mad - be mad. If you're upbeat, be upbeat. If you're angry, be angry.”</p>
      <p>*I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp starts on Sunday night at 10.45 pm on ITV2.</p>
