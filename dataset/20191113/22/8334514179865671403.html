      <p>(Reuters) - Chicago’s mayor on Wednesday rejected an alternative proposal by Uber Technologies Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/UBER.N">UBER.N</a>) to tax ride-hailing services, accusing the company of trying to resist any type of regulation by stirring up racial tensions.</p>
      <p>Uber in a statement rejected the mayor’s claims, saying its plan was raising money for the city in a more equitable way by not increasing fees on lower-income communities in Chicago’s South and West side neighborhoods.</p>
