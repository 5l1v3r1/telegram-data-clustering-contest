      <h1>Inside Forest Green Rovers: Vegan burgers, solar panels and shirts made with bamboo</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The League Two side are taking revolutionary steps in their quest to make a difference both on and off the field</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Walters, https://www.facebook.com/Mike-Walters-Mirror</a></address>
      <p>On the boardroom lunch menu, it was BBQ pulled jackfruit and beetroot potato skins, with roasted sprout. Naturally, the famous vegan burger was on parade, too.</p>
      <p>Outside, the organic pitch – free from all pesticides, fertiliser and chemicals – was being restored by the electric “mow-bot”, a GPS-directed lawnmower powered by ­electricity harnessed from daylight.</p>
      <p>Around the New Lawn, a quaint setting in rural Gloucestershire’s fringes, the world’s first carbon-neutral football club is now run on solar panels and recycled ­rainwater.</p>
      <p>The players’ shirts – designed by ­chairman and green energy industrialist Dale Vince – are made of 50 per cent ­bamboo, a world first.</p>
      <p>And coming soon, near Junction 13 of the M5, is £100million Eco Park, a new stadium to be built entirely of wood on a 100-acre site surrounded by 500 trees and a mile of hedgerows.</p>
      <p>Welcome to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/forest-green-rovers-fc">Forest Green Rovers,</a> the club that does exactly what is says on the tin: they are going to play in a forest, and they are the greenest, most eco-friendly club in the world.</p>

      <p>Vince, 58, is the former new-age traveller who is the driving force behind the League Two high-flyers, whose eco-systems are ­setting a verdant agenda.</p>
      <p>Although he has always liked football, Vince didn’t support a team until he ­resolved to pull off the greatest save of all time – better than Gordon Banks at the 1970 World Cup – on the front line of ­saving the planet.</p>
      <p>“I never planned to get involved with football and I’d never been here – although I did go to Wembley 20 years ago, when Forest Green lost the FA Trophy final 1-0 against Kingstonian,” he said.</p>

      <p>“I always liked that French dude – Eric Cantona. He was always very charismatic on the pitch, and he’s still a character now.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably one of the oldest stories in the game but I came on board in 2010, when they needed a bit of money to get through the summer, and I didn’t want to see a 125-year-old club in my local area going to the wall for the sake of a little working capital.</p>
      <p>“Next thing I knew it was autumn, the club admitted they actually needed a lot more money to survive, and they wanted me to become chairman.</p>
      <p>“It was clear the choice was either to take responsibility for the club or to see it fold, which would have been a waste.</p>
      <p>“When I took over, I didn’t have a plan or a grand design. I just did everything on the hoof. Pretty much straight away I ­realised that I’d inadvertently become part of a meat trade.</p>

      <p>"I noticed a chef serving beef lasagne to the players after training and thought, ‘That goes against the grain, I can’t be doing that’.</p>
      <p>“I called in the chef and the manager, talked to the players about ­performance and how red meat was not helpful to athletes, and everyone bought into the ‘green’ ethos.</p>
      <p>“We were accused of imposing a red meat ban – which I quite liked, ­because it stirred a bit of ­controversy – and a few of our fans were angry at first, but you expect that because it was a radical change.</p>

      <p>"Someone said last year that we had ‘feminised’ football because we used to have pies and pints at games – I pointed out that we have pies and pints at Forest Green Rovers, but ours don’t have animal products in them.</p>
      <p>“The difference between a vegan pint and a non-vegan pint is fish ­bladder. I mean, who wants fish bladder in their beer? I ­certainly believe the vegan regime plays a part in our performance on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the season, when we won promotion into the League, we had no injuries among our squad – and I put that down to the diet.</p>
      <p>"And when you look at players like Sergio Aguero in the Premier League – I read that he goes vegan during the season – the anecdotal evidence is that his sharpness and fitness is maintained by plant-based nutrition.</p>
      <p>"If it’s good enough for Aguero, it will do for me.</p>

      <p>“We don’t tell people what to do – not fans, not players, not staff – we just do things the way we believe they should be done.</p>
      <p>“From the outset, we’ve told our fans, ‘If you don’t like the food we put on, just bring your own.’ We don’t confiscate ham sandwiches.”</p>
      <p>So far, the only snide comments from a fellow chairman have come from Carlisle’s Andrew Jenkins – ­although there was a neat twist to the plot.</p>

      <p>Vince said: “Overwhelmingly, there is a genuine interest in what we are doing – whether it’s the pitch, the mow-bot, the solar panels or charging points for electric cars.</p>
      <p>“The food is obviously a big talking point and I remember only one ­visiting club coming here and being negative about the food.</p>
      <p>"The Carlisle chairman said he couldn’t bring himself to eat it because there was no meat in it and his family business has a big ­investment in the meat trade.</p>
      <p>“But he was slated on social media and, when we went up there for the return fixture, they put on a vegan matchday menu for the entire ­stadium, an amazing ­gesture.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>“When he came back here the ­following season, he was functionally polite. But if you understand the way some animals are farmed, and the ­incredible cruelty involved, I can’t ­imagine many people wanting to be a part of it.</p>
      <p>"Medical evidence suggests meat is a root cause of major chronic illnesses, including heart disease, <br/>cancers or diabetes, and it’s a major driver of ­climate change.”</p>
      <p>Reassuringly, Vince’s eco-warrior instincts don’t desert him when it comes to conferences with club ­chairmen or black-tie dinners.</p>
      <p>He never wears a tie, which ­infringes a few boardroom dress codes, and he smiled: “Since we got into the League, there has been an annual get-together of chairmen – but it’s in Portugal, so I haven’t gone because of the carbon footprint it leaves.</p>
      <p>“We raised it with the EFL, and I believe the event is going to be in ­England next year.”</p>
