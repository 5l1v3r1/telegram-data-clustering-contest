      <p>I highly recommend McKinley Valentine's email newsletter, <a href="https://mckinleyvalentine.com/">The Whippet</a>. In each issue she presents interesting ideas, art, videos, and articles.</p>
      <p>Here's an item from the latest issue (#85):</p>
      <blockquote><b>How to survive solitary confinement</b><br/><br/>I like to read <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/how-to-survive-solitary-confinement">things like this</a>, keep it in my pocket, so I worry less about what if it happens.<br/><br/>The recommendation is more or less -- you'll go crazy anyway, so go crazy with intention, to protect your brain.<br/><br/>The human brain does very badly in social isolation - we're not built for it, and people start hallucinating and dissociating very quickly when it's complete. It's actual torture, but people don't expect it to be because it sounds so low-key. <br/><br/>So the people in this article - both people who've survived solitary, and psychologists - suggest using a lot of visualisation. Imagine yourself in a much bigger space than you are, get to know it. Have a "workspace" where you train, maybe practice a sport in your mind. Every day, regularly, like you were outside and had a proper life. Imagine meeting a friend and having conversations with them.<br/><br/>Part of what makes you go crazy in isolation is the lack of external cues and structures, so it has to be structured visualisations, not just panicked uncontrolled daydreaming.<br/><br/>From someone who survived 7 years in almost total solitary confinement (again, this is torture, it is amazing he came out of it relatively okay):<br/><br/>"He he used to kill time for hours working out detailed visualizations of himself in a vivid alternate reality, where he could inhabit open spaces and converse with people.<br/><br/>“I might imagine myself at a park and come upon a person sitting on a bench,” he says. “I would ask if she or he minded if I sat down. I’d say something like, ‘Great weather today.’ The other person would respond something like, ‘It is indeed. I hope it continues until the [football game].’ ‘I know what you mean. In another couple of weeks it’s going to be cold as a witch’s tit in Wisconsin.’ As we conversed, I would watch joggers, bicyclists, and skateboarders pass by. The conversation might go on for half an hour or so. When I opened my eyes and stood, I would feel refreshed and even invigorated.” <br/><br/>There you go, now you're prepared.</blockquote>
