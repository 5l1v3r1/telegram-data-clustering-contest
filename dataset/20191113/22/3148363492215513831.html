      <h1>Donald Trump: 'I Want to Find Out Who Is the Whistleblower' | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump said Wednesday he wanted to know the identity of the so-called “whistleblower” who kicked off the impeachment inquiry, dismissing the latest public hearings conducted by House Democrats.</h2>

      <p>“I want to find out who is the whistleblower, because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information, including my call with the President of Ukraine,” Trump said, repeating that his conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky was “perfect” and “highly appropriate.”</p>
      <p>Trump said that he had not watched the hearings, as he hosted the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan for much of the afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I hear it’s a joke,” he said. “I haven’t watched for one minute because I’ve been with the president, which is far more important as far as I’m concerned.”</p>
      <p>Ambassador Bill Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent testified to the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, drawing peak attention from the establishment media.</p>
      <p>Taylor testified during the hearing that he recalled a staffer telling him of overhearing a July 26 phone conversation between Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland at a restaurant.</p>
      <p>When the aide asked Sondland what the president thought about Ukraine, Taylor recalled that the staffer said that Trump “cares more about the investigations of Biden.”</p>
      <p>Asked by Fox News reporter John Roberts about the phone conversation, Trump said he did not recall it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t recall, no, not at all, not even a little bit,” he said. “I know nothing about that, first time I’ve heard it.”</p>
      <p>Trump appeared annoyed that Democrats continued to press for impeachment, despite most of the information being derived from third-hand sources.</p>
      <p>“This is a sham and it shouldn’t be allowed,” he said.</p>
