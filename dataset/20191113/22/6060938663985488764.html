      <p>MUMBAI: Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co Ltd (The Times of India Group) has forayed into beauty services with the launch of its first <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Femina-Flaunt">Femina Flaunt</a> Studio Salon, spread over 3,000 sqft on Linking Road in Mumbai’s Khar.</p>
      <p>The company has roped in renowned experts from the field of fitness and nutrition, Mickey Mehta and Saanchi S Nayak, respectively, to serve holistic beauty solutions to its customers, and celebrity make-up artist Namrata Soni. Femina Flaunt has also collaborated with international brands from across the globe — Schwarzkopf, Olaplex, Thalgo, Morrocan Oil, Newsha, Rene Furterer, Bead Head from TiGi, and American Crew, Eminence, Jansen, OPI, Elements, The Nail Lounge, Mint Tree, Footologix, and AVL Cosmetics, among others.</p>
      <p>Times Group MD <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vineet-Jain">Vineet Jain</a>, who launched the studio along with three-times National Award winning actress <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kangana-Ranaut">Kangana Ranaut</a>, said, “We’re excited to extend our legacy brand Femina in one of the most relevant categories for women — beauty. As Femina enters its 60th year since inception, this is a befitting tribute to a brand that has kept pace with the times, and celebrated women, across generations.”</p>
      <p>He further added, “Our entry into the beauty segment is in line with the group’s philosophy of continuing to invest in newer and future growth opportunities.” Top beauty bloggers from across the style capitals of the world, from Tokyo to Rio, have been roped in to bring beauty trends to the Indian consumer, who would not only get to experience full-fledged services, but also get to see the ‘Top10Looks’ in make-up and nails, which Femina Flaunt has put together with its experts.</p>
      <p>Ranaut said, “The whole concept of beauty has changed considerably over the last few years. Today, women are comfortable in their own skin and are looking at beauty as a way of self-expression. I am really glad that Femina Flaunt has taken an approach that’s embracing and forward-looking.”</p>
      <p>According to Times Lifestyle Enterprise CEO <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sandeep-Dahiya">Sandeep Dahiya</a>, the venture will follow a hybrid model of growth in this segment, starting with COCO salons, and simultaneously expanding through a robust franchise programme to create a footprint of over 100 salons in the first five years.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Femina Flaunt forayed into the consumer products space with Shoppers Stop across core fashion categories. Today, it has a cumulative MRP sales of over Rs 25 crore.</p>
