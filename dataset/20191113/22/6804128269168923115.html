      <h1>Arsenal fans have a theory after ex-Man United striker makes transfer announcement</h1>
      <h2>Zlatan Ibrahimovic's MLS career is over</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:25:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic has confirmed he is leaving LA Galaxy after two years.</p>
      <p>The veteran Swedish forward has enjoyed a successful spell at the Los Angeles club, scoring 52 goals in 56 games.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Ibrahimovic said: "I came, I saw, I conquered. Thank you @lagalaxy for making me feel alive again. To the Galaxy fans - you wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues...Now go back to watch baseball."</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old previously spent two years at Manchester United, helping the Old Trafford club to win the League Cup and the Europa League in 2016/17.</p>
      <p>However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played down any prospect of an unlikely return for the striker: "If he was 28, not 38 next month it would be a big difference.</p>
      <p>"But Zlatan has had a great time here and, of course, he is still doing well and was unfortunate he got his injury here when he did.</p>
      <p>"So, who knows? He knows my number. He never rented my house but he was looking at it, and we can speak our native language. If he’s serious I’ll always speak to Zlatan.</p>
      <p>"No, I don’t think that will happen. I think he’s had his time at the club and he’s had a fantastic career and I wouldn’t expect him to be serious either when he says that."</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic scored 30 goals in 31 games during the regular MLS season, second only to former Arsenal forward Carlos Vela.</p>

      <p>Vela, who has netted 53 goals in 66 appearances for Los Angeles since moving to MLS from Real Sociedad in January 2018, has also been linked with a move to Spain with Barcelona reportedly interested.</p>
      <p>But Barca head coach Ernesto Valverde appeared to rule out a bid for the striker.</p>
      <p>“I remember that last year was an option that emerged and there was talk about it, but now we are not in the transfer market but we have the players we have,” Valverde said in a press conference, as cited by <a href="https://espndeportes.espn.com/futbol/espana/nota/_/id/6249569/valverde-enfria-la-posible-llegada-de-vela-al-barcelona">ESPN Deportes</a>.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, some Arsenal fans took to social media with a tongue-in-cheek theory that the Swede is leaving America thanks to the form of their former striker, and to renew their rivalry in Europe.</p>
      <p>One posted: 'Zlatan Ibrahimovic is so obsessed with Carlos Vela, he is coming to Real Sociedad to top his numbers', while another wrote: 'Just because Vela wants Barca. Zlatan so petty he couldn’t even be the best in the MLS.'</p>
