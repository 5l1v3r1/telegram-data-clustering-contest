        <b>A painting dismissed as a copy has been confirmed as a Botticelli masterpiece.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 400-year-old painting made its way from the studio of the Florentine master to the collection of philanthropist Gwendoline Davies.</p>
      <p>Portraying an image of the Madonna, the work in the National Museum Wales collection was dismissed as a crude copy of the Italian artist's style.</p>
      <p>But experts working with BBC Four programme Britain's Lost Masterpieces have found it to be an original work.</p>
      <p>Bendor Grosvenor, co-presenter of the show, said: "When I first saw this painting in the museum store, I was struck by the extraordinary beauty of the Madonna's face.</p>
      <p>"Despite all the over-paint, parts of it reminded me of Botticelli's most famous painting, the Birth Of Venus.</p>
      <p>"I'm now convinced that Botticelli played an important part in its production, and am delighted it has once more gone on public display."</p>

      <p>The painting was bequeathed by Davies to the National Museum Cardiff, but its origins were doubted despite her belief it was a genuine Botticelli.</p>
      <p>Expert analysis revealed marks unique to his studio, as well as a small doodle believed to be made by the artist himself.</p>

      <p>Now proven to be the work of the Florentine, the painting will be displayed in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Adam Webster, of the National Museum, said: "The results are striking and demonstrate the crucial role that conservation plays in the proper understanding of our heritage.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted with and grateful for the results.</p>
      <p>"The painting now sits beautifully in our galleries and I hope fans of the series will come and enjoy this masterpiece."</p>
