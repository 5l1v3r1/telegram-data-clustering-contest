      <p>Fans and journalists <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-mandalorian-episode-1-fans-react-as-new-star-wars-tv-show-launches-2567122">discussed the first episode on social media</a>, with one writer describing it as “very, very good” and many specifically referencing the ending, which includes a massive cliffhanger.</p>
      <p>Star Wars fans in the UK though aren’t able to watch <i>The Mandalorian </i>episode 1 yet – Disney+ launches on these shores on 31 March 2020 – and expressed their disappointment.</p>
      <p>One wrote: “The true gauntlet is that people in the UK have to avoid Americans spoiling <i>The Mandalorian</i> for FOUR MONTHS.”</p>
      <p>The first season will run for eight episodes and appear weekly on the streaming service.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Star Wars fans <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/star-wars-fans-react-george-lucas-changes-han-shot-first-scene-2567460">have been reacting after a notorious scene from <i>A New Hope</i></a> was changed again upon the launch of Disney+.</p>
      <p>The scene in question has prompted plenty of debate over whether Han or Greedo shoot first in their battle during <i>A New Hope</i>.</p>
      <p>In a newly tweaked version of the scene that has made it onto the streaming service, neither of the pair are shown shooting first – they fire at about the same time.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars</i> episode 9 – <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/star-wars-episode-9-release-date-trailer-1961269">The Rise Of Skywalker</a></i> – also comes to cinemas December 20.</p>
