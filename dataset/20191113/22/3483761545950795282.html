      <h1>Save Our Ocean Baths public meeting addressed by lord mayor Nuatali Nelmes and City of Newcastle staff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Moloney</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle lord mayor Nuatali Nelmes committed to conducting community consultation on the future of Merewether and Newcastle Ocean Baths before the new year, during a public meeting held on the weekend.</p>
      <p>The meeting's organiser, however, says she remains unconvinced the City of Newcastle has justified its move to seek interest from private developers before going to residents.</p>
      <p>Cr Nelmes said she understood the "anxiety and concern" provoked by concept drawings accompanying council's request for expressions of interest to redevelop and reuse the baths' pavilions, saying, "I don't like the renders either".</p>
      <p>"Nothing will happen on any of these sites without much more extensive community consultation," she said.</p>

      <p>The concept drawings for Newcastle Ocean Baths showed a modern box design sitting behind the baths' heritage-listed art deco facade, which must be retained.</p>
      <p>The renders accompanied council's request for expressions of interest in <a href="https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/6470698/council-refloats-private-development-of-newcastle-merewether-ocean-baths-pavilions/?src=rss">redeveloping or reusing the Newcastle and Merewether pavilions</a> with a potential for leases of up to 21 years.</p>
      <p>Saturday's meeting at Newcastle Ocean Baths was the first event hosted under the "Save Our Ocean Baths" banner.</p>
      <p>Merewether's Jessica Miller is coordinating a campaign to stop the EOI process after a petition she created garnered over 4500 signatures online.</p>
      <p>Council's manager of property and facilities Adam Vine addressed the gathering of around 100 people. He denied council was "starting privatisation" of the baths, when questioned by an attendee.</p>
      <p>"This is really the first step in understanding what might be possible," he said. "We're simply asking the question of the market to say, 'Do you have an interest in going on a journey with us?'"</p>
