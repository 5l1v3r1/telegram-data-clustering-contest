      <h2>Raheem Sterling will miss out on England's 1000th game on Thursday night, after being axed following an altercation with Joe Gomez at St George's Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> has admitted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> has “the hump” with him after being axed from England’s 1000th game.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro at Wembley, Southgate said: “You don’t have to be an expert in human behaviour to think it was possible.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> winger Sterling is set to return for Sunday’s trip to Kosovo and is likely to take part in the ceremony ahead of Thursday night’s game.</p>
      <p>But he will take no part in the match after being stood down following his explosive St George’s Park scrap with Liverpool's Joe Gomez on Monday.</p>
      <p>Southgate has dismissed suggestions that he would not have taken such a controversial decision had England been playing against a bigger nation such as Spain or France.</p>

      <p>“It’s hypothetical, really,” he said. “Because we’re not.</p>
      <p>“I see people ask me all the time about what they would do when they give an answer, which doesn’t really hold any sway, because they’ll only say it when they’re actually in that moment.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether Sterling had "the hump" with him, however, Southgate added: "I wouldn't imagine that he's hugely enthusiastic - but I can understand that.</p>
      <p>"He's with the group, that's the most important thing. He's a massive part of what we do - has been, will be.</p>

      <p>"He's with us for the game tomorrow, he's back with the team on the training pitch enjoying his football. [He] trained superbly well, as he always does. So for me, the thing is finished.</p>
      <p>“There might be observation about where might he be in terms of me, and giving you an honest answer of what I think he’s likely to be, this is the case at this moment in time.</p>
      <p>“But in terms of how he’s trained and how he’s been around the guys and with us, I’m happy.”</p>
      <p>Sterling’s bust-up with Gomez follow an on-field row during <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool's</a> 3-1 win over City last Sunday - a day before the England squad linked up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> defender Harry Maguire insisted there are "definitely no cliques" between players from rival clubs.</p>
      <p>"Everybody mixes," said the 26-year-old centre-back. "We all share tables and share jokes and laughs together.</p>
      <p>"You've seen how good the unity in the squad is over the past couple of years. The group has grown together.</p>
      <p>"We continue to keep on growing and that's really important.”</p>
