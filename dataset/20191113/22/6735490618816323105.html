      <p>It’s official: Alicia Keys will be returning as host of next year’s Grammy Awards, marking her second consecutive year hosting the music business’s biggest awards gala.</p>
      <p>After making her debut on the Grammys stage earlier this year, the 38-year-old singer — who already has 15 Grammys to her name — clearly impressed the Recording Academy enough to score an invite for a return engagement.</p>
      <p>“At first, I did think last year was a one-time thing, but when the opportunity came back around, there was no question about returning as host,” Keys said in a statement to <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/alicia-keys-host-grammys-2nd-year-row-66980353">“Good Morning America”</a>. “Last year was such a powerful experience for me. Not only did I feel the love in the room, but I felt it from around the world and it confirmed the healing and unifying power of music.”</p>
