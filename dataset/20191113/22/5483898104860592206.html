      <h3>A third and unreleased <a href="https://www.fiveaa.com.au/shows/david-and-will/SA-Tourism-Defends-Its-Controversial-New-Ad">Old Mate TV ad</a> featuring Adelaide Crows captain Rory Sloane is “unlikely to ever see the light of day”.</h3>
      <p>According to Channel 7, the ad, which included Old Mate sharing a can of Coke with Sloane, looked more like a Coke promotion and has been scrapped by the state government.</p>
      <p>Treasurer Rob Lucas has told 7:</p>
      <blockquote>“The tourism commission's had a rocket from me,” he told 7NEWS.<br/><br/>“I've made it quite clear this is an unacceptable practice.<br/><br/>“It won't be allowed to continue.”</blockquote>
