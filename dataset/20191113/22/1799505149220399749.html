      <p>(CN) – President Donald Trump has fallen behind the top five Democratic presidential candidates in a new survey of registered voters in Georgia.</p>
      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden and his Democratic rivals Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg all beat Trump in a hypothetical matchup, according to the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/interactive-poll-georgia-voters-november-2019/0nJnCBfUYv7wUyipCtGoOI/">poll</a> conducted for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>
      <p>Biden is leading the president by the largest margin, at 51% to Trump’s 42%. The margins are smaller among the other four Democratic candidates. Warren and Sanders each hold a 4-point advantage over Trump in the poll, while Buttigieg is ahead by 2 points and Harris has just a 1-point lead over the president.</p>
      <p>The poll, which indicates the Peach State could be a key battleground in next year’s presidential election, shows that about 53% of registered Georgia voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance as president and 44% approve.</p>
      <p>The partisan divide was apparent in the survey. About 90% of Republican respondents approve of Trump’s performance, while 96% of Democrats disapprove.</p>
      <p>Trump won Georgia in the 2016 election by 5 points. Forty-three percent of respondents in Wednesday’s poll, who are disproportionately college-educated compared to statewide numbers, said they voted for Hillary Clinton. About 42% said they voted for Trump.</p>
      <p>Georgia has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992, when Bill Clinton beat President George H.W. Bush by just 1 percentage point.</p>
      <p>The survey of 1,028 registered voters was conducted for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution by the University of Georgia’s School of Public and International Affairs from Oct. 30 to Nov. 8.</p>
      <p>The newspaper said it set out to measure public opinion to provide a snapshot of how Georgia voters feel a year out from the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a prediction of who will win the Democratic primary or the November election. It’s simply a baseline picture of where things stand right now,” political editor Susan Potter <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/the-ajc-november-2019-poll-how-and-why-conducted/U1BWSlOD7j2pPk7Xj40d1L/">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>The publication says it plans to oversee several more election polls next year, including a survey of Democratic voters just before Georgia’s March 24 primary.</p>
      <p>The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</p>
      <p>A representative from the University of Georgia could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</p>
