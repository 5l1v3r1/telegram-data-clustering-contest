      <h1>One Of Sydney’s Favourite Late Night Venues Might Be Closing Down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:13:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/tag/lockout-laws">The lockout laws</a> might have been largely repealed, but the devastation that they have done to Sydney’s nightlife is far from over.</p>
      <p>After all, there’s only so many blows that one city’s cultural life can take. The process of recovery that must come after years of austerity isn’t instantaneous — it takes a long time, and the kind of economic support that the NSW government have long proved that they are utterly unwilling to give.</p>
      <p>So perhaps it’s unsurprising that the Slyfox, one of the most beloved venues in Sydney’s inner west, is threatening closure.</p>

      <p>Last night, the owners of the Slyfox took to Facebook to share their story.</p>
      <p>See, when the venue was first established, the then-owners applied for a one-year liquor licence that they never renewed. When the lockout laws came into effect decades later, the Inner West council picked up on the fact that Slyfox had been operating for years on an expired licence, apparently unbeknownst to the venue’s new owners. But the news initially seemed good: councillors sent the Slyfox a letter saying that the venue’s licence could remain in place. Only, after a series of run-arounds concerning an amplified music law, the council then announced that they were overturning the effects of the letter — the licence had been repealed.</p>
      <p>Worse still, when the Slyfox owners submitted an appeal to get their liquor licence back, the council suddenly decided that their recommendation would be for a midnight licence, meaning that the venue cannot serve booze after 12am. That would kill the Slyfox — and so now the owners have taken to Facebook to raise awareness of their plight.</p>
      <p>And not only awareness. The Inner West council have a submission form process that means that you can tell the councillors exactly what the venue means to you. In order to do that, click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4LgNefnyVh5RBZSx2_fZvea9R0mrHZbswwEoFeiAxYYujXA/viewform">here</a> and fill out the form. To the same end, the owners have started a Change.org petition — <a href="https://www.change.org/p/inner-west-council-save-the-slyfox?recruiter=1018467179&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition">you can sign that here.</a></p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <i>If you are a supporter of our venue, LIVE Music, Dj’s, good times &amp; late nights at the SLYFOX or the Inner West area PLEASE read this in full, as we desperately need your help to save the SLYFOX from closing forever – your participation &amp; support will determine the outcome.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This is the story of SLYFOX –</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– In 1998 the SLYFOX was granted a 24hr license with a 1 year trial period. The owners at the time never re-applied for the license after the 1 year period.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– SLYFOX continued trading for 21 years following this, unbeknownst to council, the police or the current owners that the 24hr licence had lapsed.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– In 2016 once the lock out laws were in affect, it was picked up by Police that the liquor license hadn’t been re-applied for. Following that COUNCIL THEMSELVES wrote a letter stating that due to the venues history (21 years of trading with no problems) that the 24hr liquor license remained on foot.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– In 2016 Police also realised that in the current DA there was a stipulation that noted there was to be no amplified music after 3am, this was enforced &amp; the silent disco headphones sadly entered the building.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– The following 3 years the owners of SLYFOX slowly spent over $100,000 on fully sound proofing the venue with the aim of applying to council to remove the headphones from the venue by amending the DA.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– In 2019 after countless meetings with council DA planners, town planners, acoustic engineers, neighbours, lawyers, the Mayor of Inner West Darcy Bryne, the CEO of Inner West &amp; others, SLYFOX submitted to council a DA to remove the headphones for good.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– Months later Inner West council called a meeting at SLYFOX. During this meeting council informed us that our particular DA was no longer valid &amp; that they were retracting their letter from 2016 which stated we did have a 24hr liquor license. They went on to say they would HELP &amp; SUPPORT US through the process &amp; wanted us to re-apply for the 24hr liquor licence.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– SLYFOX then submitted via councils recommendation the new DA for the 24 liquor license.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– SLYFOX received 12 objections to the new DA, some which we’ve since proved to be fraudulent with no one actually living at the address of the objector.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– With 12 objections the SLYFOX DA now has to be determined by a special panel, but council will either recommend it for approval or recommend it for denial.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– SLYFOX of course via it’s many meetings/discussions with council &amp; in their words “ we will help you do this DA “ expected council to recommend the DA for approval….. but to our surprise council has now changed the goal posts on us at the VERY LAST SECOND.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>– YESTERDAY SLYFOX received a call from council stating they would be recommending a 12am midnight license!!!! Knowing very well that the outcome of this would be SLYFOX closing it’s doors forever…. We are devastated, but it’s not over just yet.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>From the owners of SLYFOX, the staff, the dj’s, the promoters, the bands, the comedians, the improv actors, the chefs, we call on you all to SAVE THE SLYFOX.
