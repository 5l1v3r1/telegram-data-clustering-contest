      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Massachusetts House lawmakers have approved a bill that would ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products while also imposing a new 75% excise tax on nicotine vaping products.</p>
      <p>The ban would apply to menthol cigarettes - a decision that has rankled some convenience store owners.</p>
      <p>Under the proposal, commercial health insurers and MassHealth would also be required to cover tobacco cessation counseling and all nicotine replacement therapies. Generic versions would be offered without cost-sharing to the consumer.</p>
      <p>Supporters of the bill say their goal is to protect young people from the harmful effects of tobacco.</p>
      <p>Anti-smoking activists were quick to praise lawmakers for approving the bill, which passed Wednesday on a 126-31 vote.</p>
      <p>In Massachusetts, 9,300 adults die annually from smoking.</p>
      <p>The bill now heads to the Senate.</p>
