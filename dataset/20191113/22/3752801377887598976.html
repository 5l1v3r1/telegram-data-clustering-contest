      <p>A new report by United Nations special investigators says Kenya's military was responsible for five attacks on telecommunications masts in neighbouring Somalia, including strikes that killed two civilians.</p>
      <p>The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) attacked communications towers in Somalia between 2017 and 2019, in a possible effort to stop al-Shabaab using mobile signals to detonate bombs, an expert panel reported in its latest update to the UN Security Council on Monday.</p>
      <p>The panel, which monitors sanctions on Somalia, said it received reports of KDF attacks on 12 towers operated by Hormuud Telecom, a Mogadishu-based provider, since 2017, almost all in Gedo along Kenya's northernmost border with Somalia.</p>
      <p>"The Panel has been able to independently corroborate five of those attacks... which resulted in the deaths of two civilians," the UN sanctions committee said.</p>
      <p>A security guard and his relative died in July 2018 in an alleged KDF shelling on a Hormuud station, the report added.</p>
      <p>The KDF denied any involvement in the attacks during a meeting with the UN experts, the report noted.</p>
      <p>The report did not give details of how all of the attacks were carried out, although it referred to shelling in one incident and to at least one air strike.</p>
      <p>Hormuud Telecom has alleged at least 12 attacks. In August, it said that one assault had not only destroyed a mast but also two power generators, batteries and a building.</p>
      <p>The findings come at a time of strained relations between Kenya and Somalia.</p>
      <p>The neighbours are sparring on several diplomatic fronts, including a battle over contested marine borders with possibly lucrative Indian Ocean oil and gas reserves at stake.</p>
      <p>Kenya sent troops into southern Somalia in 2011, joining the regional peacekeeping force Amisom that drove al-Shabaab from Mogadishu.</p>
      <p>It has justified the incursion to protect Kenyans from the al-Qaeda affiliate which, among other assaults, killed 21 people in Nairobi in January.</p>
      <p>It was also suspected of a roadside bombing in October that killed 11 Kenyan police officers near the Somali border.</p>
      <p>In its report, the UN panel recorded "an unprecedented number" of cross-border attacks into Kenya by the Islamist militants in June and July this year. These were possibly timed to worsen relations between the East African neighbours, it said.</p>
      <p>For the first time, investigators also found proof al-Shabaab had been making homemade bombs since at least July 2017, no longer relying on explosives leftover from Somalia's devastating civil war.</p>
      <p>The UN report acknowledged that KDF attacks on telecommunications equipment may "prevent al-Shabaab from triggering improvised explosive devices" using mobile networks.</p>
      <p>It also noted KDF complaints that its communications towers had also been attacked since 2015, largely by al-Shabaab.</p>
      <p>"However, there are humanitarian implications to the long-term loss of telecommunications coverage within Somalia, including impeding the coordination of relief efforts, the transfer of food vouchers and the receipt of remittances from outside the country," it said.</p>
