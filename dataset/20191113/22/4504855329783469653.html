      <h1>Doctors removed a tumor the size of a soccer ball from a man’s neck</h1>

      <p>(CNN) — The New Jersey man had just one option to get rid of the massive tumor that had been growing on his neck and was now threatening his life: Remove it.</p>
      <p>But its placement made that a risky endeavor.</p>
      <p>Milton Wingert, 81, had been to several physicians to see the tumor over the past six months, but most were concerned about what it would take to remove the growth.</p>
      <p>Then Wingert turned to Dr. Nazir Khan, a head and neck surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital, who convinced him it was doable.</p>
      <p>The men had a very through conversation regarding what could happen during surgery — including potential complications. “I want everybody to be prepared, before we step in the operating room, for any scenario,” Khan told CNN of what was conveyed.</p>
      <p>“When a case is more complicated, my thought process is always, what is the best-case scenario, what’s the worst-case scenario. And I prepare for the worst-case scenario and hope for the best.”</p>
      <p>The surgery, which took seven hours, was a success. Khan said the malignant tumor he removed weighed between 5 and 7 pounds.</p>
      <p>And his patient’s recovery is only just beginning.</p>
      <p>“I know that he’s going to need further therapy, and so my training has made me cautiously optimistic in a way, because I know he still has a road to go,” Khan said.</p>
      <p>“But, you know, I’m happy for him, because I know that he was very scared before the surgery…it was a relatively quicker surgery than we anticipated, we didn’t have to do a reconstruction, and he did well.”</p>
      <p>Wingert is recovering at the hospital and declined to speak with CNN. He gave his doctor permission to speak about the case.</p>
