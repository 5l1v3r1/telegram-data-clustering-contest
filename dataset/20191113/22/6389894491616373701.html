      <p>Nike is pulling its clothes and shoes from e-commerce site Amazon as part of a pivot to selling directly to customers.</p>
      <p>Nike announced late on Tuesday that it was ending a pilot scheme to sell its goods through Amazon which began in 2017.</p>
      <p>“As part of Nike’s focus on elevating consumer experiences through more direct, personal relationships, we have made the decision to complete our current pilot with Amazon Retail,” it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to invest in strong, distinctive partnerships for Nike with other retailers and platforms to seamlessly serve our consumers globally,” it added.</p>

      <p>Nike appointed former Ebay boss John Donahoe as chief executive last month in a signal of its intention to bet big on e-commerce.</p>
      <p>Nike’s digital revenue surged 35 per cent in the last fiscal year, with the company expecting online sales to account for about a third of its business by 2023.</p>
      <p>The move to pull its wares from Amazon comes after reports that Nike told retailers last month that it would stop supplying them with its products.</p>

      <p>Those reports led to an intervention by Sports Direct which called for a competition probe into how sportswear giants like Nike and Adidas use their market position.</p>
      <p>The Mike Ashley-led retailer said top brands “use their market power to implement market-wide practices aimed at controlling the supply and, ultimately, the pricing of their products”.</p>
      <p>Amazon declined to comment.</p>
