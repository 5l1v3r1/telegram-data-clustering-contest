      <p>Nov. 13 (UPI) -- A car bomb exploded near the Kabul airport Wednesday, killing 12 people, including three children, Afghan officials said.</p>
      <p>In addition to the dead, 20 others, including four foreigners who worked for the GardaWorld Security Company, <a href="https://tolonews.com/afghanistan/seven-people-killed-kabul-car-blast">sustained injuries</a>, Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said. The ministry said the bomb was inside a vehicle owned by the firm.</p>
      <p>No group <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/seven-killed-mostly-children-in-kabul-suicide-blast/2019/11/13/3a2eb178-05d6-11ea-9118-25d6bd37dfb1_story.html">claimed responsibility</a> for the attack.</p>
      <p>The attack came one day after Afghan President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ashraf_Ghani/?tps=1">Ashraf Ghani</a> announced the <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/12/Afghanistan-exchanges-Taliban-members-for-abducted-US-professors/8041573548704/?upi_ss=afghanistan">conditional release</a> of three high-ranking Taliban members in exchange for two American university professors held captive by the Islamist militant group since 2016.</p>
      <p>The prisoner exchange comes amid <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/09/10/Taliban-promises-to-keep-fighting-after-Trump-says-peace-talks-dead/6791568110151/">stalled peace talks</a> between the United States and the Taliban following President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> declaring the process "dead" in September.</p>
      <p>Ghani said the deal could prove as a launchpad for talks between his government and the Taliban, which has said it won't negotiate with the Middle Eastern government as they view it as a U.S. puppet regime.</p>
