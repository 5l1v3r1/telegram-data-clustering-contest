      <h2>Here's why Tesla and Disney were on the move as the broader markets rallied.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:08:23+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/2102/" target="_blank">Steve Symington (TMFSymington)</a></address>
      <p>Major benchmarks climbed on Wednesday as investors digested the latest quarterly earnings news, as well as a statement from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting the central bank's approach to managing interest rates will likely remain unchanged in the near future.</p>
      <p>"We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective," Powell explained.</p>
      <p>The <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average </b>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/djindices/dow-jones-industrial-average/%5Edji/">DJINDICES:^DJI</a>) ended the session at a record high after gaining roughly 0.3%, while the <b>S&amp;P 500 </b>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/snpindex/sp-500-index/%5Egspc/">SNPINDEX:^GSPC</a>) edged up more modestly.</p>

      <h3>Tesla plans German expansion</h3>
      <p>Shares of Tesla initially climbed as much as 2%, then pulled back to close down 1.1% after CEO Elon Musk revealed the company will build both a new Gigafactory and an engineering and design center in Berlin, Germany. </p>
      <p>The announcement came at an awards ceremony in Germany yesterday, where Musk elaborated: "Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding, and that's part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany."</p>
      <p>The exact time frame for completion of Tesla's German facility -- which will mark its fourth Gigafactory, following others in Nevada, New York, and most recently China -- has yet to be determined. But the company has previously said it wants to begin mass production in Europe by 2021.</p>
      <p>Musk added that Tesla had also considered locating its European facility in the U.K., but ultimately decided there was too much uncertainty in the country given risks surrounding Brexit.</p>
      <h3>Disney+ hits 10 million subscribers -- on day one</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, after starting the day in negative territory, shares of Disney soared 7.3% after the entertainment giant announced its new Disney+ streaming service reached 10 million subscribers since its official launch yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>That said -- keeping in mind users can sign up for a seven-day free trial of the service -- the company didn't clarify exactly how many of the 10 million are actually <i>paying </i>the $6.99 subscription price for Disney+ at this stage<i>. </i>It's also unclear how much of that total came from pre-launch offers; recall Disney previously gave members of its D23 club (which has a free tier) the opportunity to <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/09/24/the-disney-hype-machine-is-just-getting-started.aspx">sign up for a three-year subscription</a> for $141, or less than $4 per month.</p>
      <p>But it's also an incredible feat considering it took Disney just under one year to <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/07/how-disney-grew-espn-to-2-million-subscribers.aspx">grow its ESPN+ service</a> to 2 million subscribers. This early momentum marks an undeniably strong start as the company works toward its initial goal of reaching 60 million to 90 million Disney+ subscribers -- and sustained profitability for the platform -- by 2024.</p>
