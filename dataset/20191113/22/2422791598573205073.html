      <p>CALGARY -- Ideas that could give Alberta more independence from the federal government are getting a tepid reception from one of the province's big-city mayors and a chamber of commerce boss.</p>
      <p>Premier Jason Kenney's United Conservative government has formed a panel to examine ways for Alberta to get what he calls a "fair deal" in Canada. They include establishing a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan and replacing the RCMP with a provincial police force.</p>
      <p>Any of those would have to be endorsed in a referendum.</p>
      <p>"The way I work and the way we've operated the city is really to be as efficient as possible and to deliver services as efficiently as possible," Mayor Naheed Nenshi said Wednesday following a speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce ahead of his city council's upcoming budget talks.</p>
      <p>"And when I look at the things that panel is looking at, I see increased costs."</p>
      <p>He noted the creation of the panel comes after a tough provincial budget that ended inflation indexing on assured income payments to people with severe disabilities, increased the interest rate on student loans, scrapped a funding agreement with Edmonton and Calgary, and reduced support for some seniors.</p>
      <p>"The benefits really had better be there ... We really have to make that justification I think."</p>
      <p>Resentment and calls for separation have been roiling in Alberta since the Liberals were re-elected in last month's federal vote, but with a minority mandate. Kenney, who says he does not support full-on separatism, has lambasted the Liberals for policies he says have hurt the provincial oil and gas industry.</p>
      <p>Sandip Lalli, CEO of the Calgary chamber, said the ideas the panel will weigh don't offer much to a city that faces a property tax crunch as businesses empty out of the downtown core.</p>
      <p>"It's not adding greater certainty or clarity to what we're doing here in Alberta to be more competitive."</p>
      <p>And she said she's not sure withdrawing from the CPP would be worthwhile.</p>
      <p>"Is it better managed where it is and are the returns adequate where they are? Or is there a performance issue?" she asked.</p>
      <p>In his speech, Nenshi sought to dispel what he called lies or myths about the city's finances -- that spending and property taxes are out of control, civil servants are overpaid and the UCP's inaugural budget last month did not hurt Calgary's bottom line.</p>
      <p>He and Lalli expressed skepticism in the Kenney government's view that lowering corporate taxes to eight per cent from 12 per cent by 2022 would be enough to jump-start the economy. The UCP has done away with targeted tax incentives, brought in by the previous NDP government, to diversify revenue sources beyond oil and gas.</p>
      <p>"It's not a point of pride that we are the lowest tax regime ... if it's not making us competitive to grow and reach more customers," Lalli said.</p>
      <p>Nenshi said while companies may set up a branch office in Calgary, it's his experience that it's rare for them to move their entire headquarters -- so the tax drop is likely to make little difference.</p>
      <p>The city's quality of life, availability of talent and affordable office space could still beckon new investment, he said.</p>
      <p>"There's lots of tools there, but certainly we have fewer than we did six months ago."</p>
