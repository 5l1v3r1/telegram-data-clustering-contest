      <h1>Wework losses ballooned to $1.3bn in quarter before failed float</h1>

      <p>Wework losses reportedly more than doubled to $1.3bn (£1bn) in the third quarter ahead of its expected initial public offering (IPO).</p>
      <p>The figures contained in a presentation for Wework creditors today showed why the company was thrown into crisis when its expected $9bn IPO and connected debt financing deal collapsed in September.</p>
      <p>The debacle led to the exit of its founder and chief executive Adam Neumann and a rescue package from major backer Softbank.</p>

      <p>Wework opened nearly 100 new offices in the three months ended September taking its total to 625, the reports said. </p>
      <p>During the quarter Wework’s net revenue jumped 94 per cent from the previous year to $934m.</p>
      <p>The company said it added 115,000 desks in the quarter, taking it to a total of 719,000.</p>

      <p>Its overall occupancy rate fell to 79 per cent from 82 per cent at the end of the quarter. </p>
      <p>Last month Japan’s Softbank took control of the company, providing $1.5bn to help its financial situation, arranging a $5bn debt financing and agreeing to buy $3bn in shares from the company’s investors.</p>
      <p>Softbank has appointed its chief operating officer Marcelo Claure as Wework’s executive chairman and is searching for a new chief executive to lead the group, with T-Mobile US boss John Legere among the potential candidates.</p>
      <p>Wework was contacted for comment.</p>
