      <p>A lottery winner who spent 19 years going on cruises with his wife is­­ ­fulfilling her dying wish for him to keep sailing the seas.</p>
      <p>Ray and Barbara Wragg had never been abroad until they scooped £7.6million in 2000.</p>
      <p>The generous couple gave away more than £5.5million to friends, family and good causes.</p>
      <p>But with the rest they went around the world on 29 cruises. Sadly, Barbara died of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">sepsis</a> in May aged 77 after an operation. But 81-year-old Ray said: “We stopped cruising after Barbara became poorly.</p>
      <p>“But we loved it so much and before she died she said to me, ‘Carry on cruising,’ so that’s what I’m going to do.</p>

      <p>The retired roofer, speaking as he celebrated the National Lottery’s 25th birthday, told how he and Barbara had spent every year before their win going to Torquay in Devon for holidays.</p>
      <p>The couple, of Sheffield, hit the headlines after declaring the £7.6million was “too much for two people”.</p>
      <p>Apart from their three grown-up children, they gave cash to hospitals, youth schemes, war veterans and various charities.</p>
