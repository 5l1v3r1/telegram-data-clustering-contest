      <h1>Congressman cryptically spells out 'EPSTEIN DIDN’T KILL HIMSELF' using first letter of 23 tweets</h1>

      <p>Republican Rep. Paul Gosar spelled out the phrase “Epstein didn’t kill himself” using the first letter of each tweet in a string of 23 tweets.</p>
      <p>The tweets spell out the phrase when read in reverse chronological order. The first tweet begins, “Evidence of a link between foreign aid and political investigations simply does not exist. The longer this circus continues the clearer it becomes that @realDonaldTrump has done absolutely nothing wrong.”</p>

      <p>The phrase has gone viral and sparked countless memes since Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire convicted sex offender on trial for sex trafficking, was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide">found dead in his Manhattan prison cell</a> in August. The New York City chief medical examiner <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-york-medical-examiner-jeffrey-epstein-died-by-suicide">ruled his death a suicide,</a> but others, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/medical-examiner-stands-by-conclusion-that-epstein-died-of-suicide-by-hanging">including a medical examiner</a> hired by Epstein’s family, said that it appeared more consistent with homicide.</p>
      <p>The phrase was also <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-msnbc-ignores-alabama-student-who-says-jeffrey-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-on-live-tv">recently dropped into an MSNBC interview</a> with a college student at the University of Alabama football game.</p>
      <p>“Why do you like him so much, and what policies stand out to you?” she asked a male student at the game.</p>
      <p>“I would say mainly just the no-nonsense policies and especially since Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself,” he responded. “That’s awesome. Just totally perfect.”</p>
      <p>Mike Ritland, a former Navy SEAL, also <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-fox-host-cracks-up-as-guest-utters-epstein-didnt-kill-himself">made the same claim</a> at the tail end the end of an appearance on Fox News.</p>
