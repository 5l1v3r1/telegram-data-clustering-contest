      <p>REGINA -- Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says all options are on the table when it comes to expanding his province's autonomy, except for separation.</p>
      <p>Moe says it's still early going and he will be considering different ideas.</p>
      <p>"I don't think Saskatchewan separating from the nation is the answer," he said following question period Wednesday in the Saskatchewan legislature.</p>
      <p>"However, I am not going to denounce the feelings and the conversations that are happening by Saskatchewan people," he said.</p>
      <p>"What we're considering is the conversation about what opportunities we may have to enhance our provincial autonomy."</p>
      <p>Moe said Tuesday, after what he called a disappointing meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, that the province would be looking at ways of increasing its independence.</p>
      <p>Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who shares Moe's concerns about how they believe Ottawa is treating the energy-producing provinces, has floated ideas such as pulling out of the RCMP in favour of a provincial police force or withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan Opposition NDP Leader Ryan Meili said Moe needs to denounce separating from Canada rather than flirting with the idea by bringing up provincial autonomy.</p>
      <p>Meili suggested Moe is playing to the separatist vote in the province.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't want to alienate any of his base and, as a result, fails to take any positions of conscience."</p>
