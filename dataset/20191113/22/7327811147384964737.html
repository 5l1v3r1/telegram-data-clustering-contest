      <p>MANORVILLE, Suffolk County (WABC) -- Suffolk County police rescued six dogs left outside in freezing temperatures in Manorville.</p>
      <p>Officers responded to a 911 call of dogs left outside unattended at 10:40 p.m. on Toppings Path near County Road 111.</p>
      <p>When the officers arrived on the scene at the non-residential area, they found six unattended dogs, two on chains and four in cages, without adequate access to shelter.</p>
      <p>The temperature registered 25 degrees, and the water in the dogs' bowls was frozen.</p>
      <p>"It could be a death sentence to leave your dog outside," Suffolk County SPCA Chief Roy Gross said.</p>
      <p>Gross said they also had a case Tuesday where a pit bull was left outside in Middle Island right before the temperature dipped below freezing.</p>
      <p>The county's law was revamped in 2017 to be very strict on tethering, especially in brutally cold weather. No dog can be tethered more than one hour.</p>
      <p>"But it's below 32 degrees, a dog cannot be tethered at all," Gross said. "Cannot be left out at all."</p>
      <p>Police rescued the dogs, three beagles and three bloodhounds, ranging in age from 1 to 5 years old, and took them to Animal Emergency Service in Selden.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the dogs is asked to call the Seventh Precinct Crime Section at 631-854-8726.</p>
      <p>

      <p>No dog can be tethered for any length of time if the chain or tether:<br/>--Endangers dog's health, safety or well-being<br/>--Restricts dog's access to suitable and sufficient food, fresh, potable water and dry ground<br/>--Does not provide such dog with shelter appropriate to its breed, physical condition, and the climate<br/>--Unreasonably limits the movement because it is too short for the dog to move around or for the dog to urinate or defecate in a separate area from the area where it must eat, drink or lie down<br/>--Is a choke collar, pinch collar, or prong collar, or a similar collar that restrains the dog in such a manner that it impairs the flow of oxygen or blood to the dog, which may cause choking or causes substantial discomfort<br/>--Is embedded, partially embedded or may become embedded in such dog's skin<br/>--Has weights attached or contains links that are more than 1/4 inch thick<br/>--Weighs more than 12.5% of the dog's total body weight, not to exceed 15 pounds for any dog<br/>--Is less than 15 feet in length<br/>--Is long enough to allow such dog to move outside of its owner's property<br/>--Would allow the restrained dog to move over an object, including any fencing, barrier, or edge that could result in the strangulation of or injury<br/>--Is fixed (i.e., does not swivel) on either end</p>
      <p>No person shall tether, leash, fasten, secure, restrain, chain or tie a dog to any stationary object outdoors for more than one continuous hour in any continuous twelve-hour period between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m.</p>
