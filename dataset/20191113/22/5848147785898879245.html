      <h1>Australia’s biggest economic problem is getting worse</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:05:32+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/michael-pascoe/" target="_blank">Michael Pascoe</a></address>
      <p>At 11.30am on Wednesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics made a joke out of the Reserve Bank’s inflation target and the federal government’s budget policy.</p>
      <p>The economic policy that counts for people – the prospect of growth they can feel, of improving living standards – depends on achieving higher real incomes.</p>
      <p>The ABS showed wages growth is slowing, that the RBA’s alleged “gentle turning point” has gently turned down.</p>
      <p>The details are worse for the RBA and government than the bare wage price index headline of half-a-per cent growth for the September quarter and 2.2 per cent for the year.</p>

      <p>The central bank’s inflation outlook credibility has been trashed and the government is promising most Australians a poorer future.</p>
      <p>Worse again is that most Australians now don’t expect real wages to rise anyway, an expectation that is dangerously self-fulfilling.</p>
      <p>According to the latest Melbourne Institute’s consumer inflationary and wage expectations survey, we think total pay will rise by 1.9 per cent in the year ahead.</p>

      <p>The same survey reports worse total pay growth than the ABS – 1.9 per cent in the year to September and slipping to 1.8 per cent for the year to October.</p>
      <p>Most workers actually reported either no change in pay or a fall over the past year.</p>
      <p>Only 43.1 per cent reported a pay rise, compared with 46 per cent with no change and 10.9 per cent suffering a fall.</p>
      <p>The RBA and government have <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2019/11/06/michael-pascoe-rba-november/">effectively given up</a> achieving the desired two-to-three per cent inflation target in any vaguely forecastable future.</p>
      <p>That was a good reason for not changing the Treasurer’s agreement with the bank – it would be embarrassing to draw more attention to the failure when the RBA is incapable of doing anything more about it and the government doesn’t care to help.</p>
      <p>Within Wednesday’s ABS figures was proof that the RBA itself can’t really believe what it’s saying about inflation.</p>
      <p>The bank says the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is likely to be about 4.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>That’s what it thinks the unemployment rate has to fall to before we get the pick up in inflation the bank wants to see.</p>
      <p>This theoretical belief flies in the face of observed experience.</p>
      <p>New South Wales’ unemployment rate averaged 4.4 per cent over the year to September – but private sector wages in NSW only rose by 2.1 per cent over that year.</p>
      <p>Only WA and Queensland had lower wages growth.</p>
      <p>The Greater Sydney area unemployment rate averaged 4.2 per cent – and there’s no sign of wages inflation breaking out.</p>
      <p>The evidence, as opposed to the RBA’s theoretical modelling, suggests NAIRU is more likely to start with a 3.</p>
      <p>And even the government’s hopelessly optimistic economic projections – which assume the economy is running perfectly with 3 per cent GDP growth in two years – can see nothing better than 5 per cent unemployment over the four-year budget numbers.</p>
      <p>The Frydenberg budget is based on the wage price index growing by 2.75 per cent this financial year – pull the other one – rising to 3.25 per cent next year and 3.5 per cent thereafter.</p>
      <p>The unemployment projection, the likely NAIRU and RBA’s inflation forecasts mean those numbers are nonsense.</p>
      <p>Consumption makes up the better part of 60 per cent of GDP.</p>
      <p>Per capita consumption is flat – growth is only coming from the population increasing.</p>
      <p>Even with 1.6 per cent population growth, the amount of stuff Australians bought in the first nine months of this year fell.</p>
      <p>Thus we are caught in a vicious cycle of deficient wages growth feeding into weak private sector economic growth, which in turn reinforces business’s determination not to increase wages any more than it absolutely has to – a dismal situation that most people accept as they have little power to do otherwise.</p>
      <p>All the growth in the economy at present is coming from the government sector, thanks to the states.</p>
      <p>The federal government chasing its surplus fixation means it is tightening fiscal policy, taking more money out of the economy than it puts in.</p>
      <p>While the RBA wishes for stronger consumption, it has placed much of the blame squarely on weak wages growth and the government taking more in income tax.</p>
      <p>Yes, despite the stage one tax cuts, the government continues to take more of workers’ income in tax. And it continues to enforce a sub-par cap on public servants’ wages.</p>
      <p>Allow me to repeat a quick example: If there was someone working at the RBA on the median wage – about $60,000 a year – the government’s 2 per cent cap means that person would really only get a rise of 1.65 per cent after taking into account the 32.5 per cent tax rate on the extra money.</p>
      <p>A 2 per cent pre-tax rise doesn’t even keep up with the latest low inflation figure of 1.7 per cent.</p>
      <p>Individuals might not be able to articulate the economic problem but they feel it and increasingly are keeping their wallets and purses closed for all but necessities.</p>
      <p>It’s no surprise that about 93 per cent of people with mortgages have not reduced their repayment amounts after the recent interest rate cuts – they’re cautiously paying down debt.</p>
      <p>And it’s no surprise that another shaving of the RBA’s official rate will have negligible impact – we’re at the limit of useful monetary policy without turning radical, which itself would be of dubious benefit.</p>
      <p>The government has been trying to ignore the reality of its wages suppression policy but it will be very hard to continue to do so in Treasurer Frydenberg’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (MYEFO) due next month.</p>
      <p>Might the government respond to reality by finally granting the wish of business, individuals and the RBA to offer a little economic stimulus instead of making the situation worse?</p>
      <p>There’s speculation that Morrison/Frydenberg might announce the stage two tax cuts will be brought forward from 2022-23 to 2021-22 – still 18 months too late to be of use.</p>
      <p>What’s more, stage two is aimed to benefit people on six-figure taxable incomes, and even then not by enough to overcome bracket creep.</p>
      <p>The only impact that will really be felt from the government’s radical flattening of the progressive income tax system is stage three for people on fatter six figures.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the relatively well-off, the top decile, have a greater capacity to save tax cuts than the rest of the population.</p>
      <p>Trickle down doesn’t work, but that’s all that’s on offer.</p>
