      <h1>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield is Not a Metaphor For Brexit</h1>

      <p>Nintendo is famous among video content creators for enforcing intense embargo restrictions for new games. The restrictions for <i>Pokémon Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> are the most intense I’ve seen yet. Watch this video, in which I struggle to follow them.</p>

      <p><i>Pokémon</i>’s game design leverages wonder, discovery, and surprise. Nintendo respectfully asked me, a professional working for a big website, to help preserve that. I love my Nintendo Switch about as much as I love my Xbox One X, so I immediately agreed.</p>
      <p>I had to read the embargo restrictions a dozen times.</p>
      <p>I can’t show the inside of a Pokémon Centre. I can’t show the inside <i>or</i> outside of a Pokémon gym or stadium. I can show Corviknight, though I can’t show the Pokémon Corviknight evolves from. The list goes on.</p>
      <p>My video can contain no more than six minutes of footage, contained in clips of no longer than 20 seconds each.</p>
      <p>I Twitter DMed my lawyer to jokingly ask how much he’d charge for a consult on a video coverage embargo. Then I quickly DMed him again to clarify: “Please don’t answer that.” I knew he would charge me an hour’s consultation fee just to reply to a joke. Let that be a life lesson: get yourself a lawyer who doesn’t even joke with you for free.</p>
      <p>I sighed at those embargo restrictions many times, that day.</p>
      <p>“I could always just <i>not</i> make a video about <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>,” my Blue side said. Then my Red side piped up: “I gotta catch ‘em all [the YouTube views].”</p>
      <p>Flummoxed for an adequate coverage strategy, I turned and faced the void. I asked Twitter to ask me questions. 304 of you replied. 220 of your questions died beneath the boots of the embargo.</p>
      <p>About 50 of you made a joke about Brexit.</p>
      <p>Well, that’s the story of my video.</p>
      <p>Click play to experience ten minutes in which I try my best to answer the following questions using six minutes’ worth of 20-second clips from the game, none of them showing the inside of a Pokémon Center:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is There Brexit?</li>
        <li>Can Trainers Punch Wild Pokémon?</li>
        <li>Can You Eat A Wooloo?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <i>Pokémon</i> <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> video embargo restrictions lift on Friday morning, by the way. I wonder if Gita Jackson and I are going to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kotaku">stream it on our Twitch channel</a> on Friday? Hmm. Maybe we are.</p>
