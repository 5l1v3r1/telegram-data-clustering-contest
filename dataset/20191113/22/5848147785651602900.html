      <h1>Premature babies could unlock the mystery of the hiccup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:07:28+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/zona-black/" target="_blank">Zona Black</a></address>
      <p>Pre-term babies spend 15 minutes of their first days on Earth hiccuping – the most of any human – and it’s these 15 minutes that scientists now believe could answer the age-old question: Why do we hiccup, and to what purpose?</p>
      <p>Humans start hiccuping at nine weeks’ gestation, a habit that carries through to when a child is born.</p>
      <p>We’re more likely, pre-term or not, to hiccup when we’re young.</p>
      <p>This frequency that fades away with age (although doesn’t completely disappear, as any adult who has lived through a hiccup attack can relate to) could very well point to hiccups being a key part in our developmental pathways.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245719312362">New research from UCL</a> this week shows a link between the action and brain waves that remind a baby’s body to breathe, which leads to a natural reflex to adapt a breathing pattern.</p>
      <p>Study lead author Kimberley Whitehead said this finding led the team to believe hiccups just stuck around in later life, as a hangover from infancy.</p>
      <p>“The reasons for why we hiccup are not entirely clear, but there may be a developmental reason, given that fetuses and newborn babies hiccup so frequently,” Ms Whitehead said.</p>
      <h3>How the hiccup was solved</h3>
      <p>To reach these conclusions, the UCL team studied 13 newborn infants (from 30 to 42 weeks gestational age) who were experiencing bouts of hiccups.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, they recorded their brain activity through electrodes on the scalp, while movement sensors monitored the infants’ torsos to detect when they were hiccuping.</p>
      <p>They found when the baby hiccuped, it triggered three large brainwaves.</p>
      <p>It was the third one that held the most interest for them: It worked in the same way that a brain reacts to sound. So the “hic” onomatopoeia of the movement created a development link between diaphragm contractions and breathing.</p>
      <p>Study senior author Dr Lorenzo Fabrizi explained: “The activity resulting from a hiccup may be helping the baby’s brain to learn how to monitor the breathing muscles so that eventually breathing can be voluntary controlled by moving the diaphragm up and down.</p>
      <p>“When we are born, the circuits which process body sensations are not fully developed, so the establishment of such networks is a crucial developmental milestone for newborns.”</p>
      <p>This discovery means hiccups might fall into the category of vestigial reflexes – something that a species still experiences that once had an important purpose, but is now defunct and unnecessary.</p>
      <p>In humans, these reflexes still exist.</p>
      <p>There’s goosebumps, which used to raise the hair or fur on our skin to protect us against the cold. Or, if we were faced with a threat, to make us appear bigger and scarier to our foe.</p>
      <p>Have you ever had your arm or leg jerk suddenly, while you’re on the verge of falling asleep?</p>
      <p>That’s called the hypnic jerk, and it probably stems from way, way back, when humans used to sleep in trees.</p>
      <p>Science isn’t 100 per cent sold on the origin of the jerk, but the tree sleeping root makes sense: You’d be pulled from your sleep just to definitely make sure you were in a stable position and not at risk of falling out.</p>
