      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> will not join the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/queen">Queen</a> for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>They have chosen to spend baby Archie’s first festive season away from Sandringham.<br/><br/>The Sussexes could stay at home in Windsor or travel abroad to be with Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland.<br/><br/>A source said that the couple — parents to six-month-old Archie — “needed to recharge their batteries.”<br/><br/>But their decision will do little to heal the rifts that have opened up with the rest of the Royal Family.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-prince-harry-surprise-military-families">MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY SURPRISE MILITARY FAMILIES, SHARE DETAILS ON BABY ARCHIE</a></b><br/><br/>The couple are taking a six-week break after Sunday when Harry, 35, attends a Royal Albert Hall event.<br/><br/>It was thought they would spend Thanksgiving in the US with Doria, 63, and return for Christmas at Sandringham.<br/><br/>But they informed Her Majesty, 93, they will not be joining her and Prince Philip, 98.<br/><br/>A royal source said: “They need some time away to recharge and decide their plans for next year.”<br/><br/>Harry has always spent Christmas at the Queen’s Norfolk home, except for 2012 when he was in Afghanistan — and for the past two years he has been joined by Meghan, 38.<br/><br/><b>'QUITE STRESSFUL'</b><br/><br/>Royal biographer Ingrid Seward said: “Christmas at Sandringham can be quite stressful so perhaps they don’t want to go with Archie at such a young age.</p>
      <p>“Having said that, Sandringham has played host to many many children through the ages and is well set up for them.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s sad they don’t want to be part of the family gathering, particularly now the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are in their dotage.<br/><br/>“The Queen might be a little hurt but she’s far too gracious to ever let it show or be known.”<br/><br/>Meghan and Harry also skipped the royals’ annual holiday in Balmoral this year.<br/><br/>Seward added: “It does seem to be nothing to do with Archie and to do with their own personal feelings.”<br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></b><br/><br/>Ex-US actress Meghan revealed in an ITV interview this year how the “British stiff upper lip” was “damaging” — causing concern among royals.</p>
      <p>One insider said: “That’s the very essence of this family.”</p>
      <p>Harry also admitted he and William were on “different paths.”<br/><br/><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10333855/harry-meghan-decline-queen-sandringham-invitation/"><b>This story originally appeared in The Sun.</b></a></p>
