      <h1>City of Wanneroo welcomes road funding boost</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:42:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Jarvis</a></address>
      <p>THE City of Wanneroo could receive an extra $3.5 million from the State Government to upgrade roads.</p>
      <p>Main Roads has offered the City $3 million to widen Hartman Drive between Hepburn Avenue and Gnangara Road as well as $496,000 to resurface Mirrabooka Avenue and Marangaroo Drive.</p>
      <p>The council accepted the funding offer at its November 12 meeting, which will be subject to receiving endorsement from the Metropolitan Regional Road Group on November 22.</p>
      <p>Mayor Tracey Roberts said the group recognised the City’s comprehensive preparation for the projects when it allocated the funding.</p>
      <p>“We were ready to proceed and that worked in our favour to secure the funding,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The City has diligently finalised planning for the Hartman Drive project which is ready to start in the first half of next year.</p>
      <p>“Council had the foresight to allocate funds in last year’s budget to prepare designs for Hartman Drive which were completed in July this year and as a result the Hartman Drive project was offered funding because it is ready for community engagement and construction tenders.</p>
      <p>“Our community will be provided with details of the intended works and timeframes through an engagement process.”</p>
      <p>Councillors voted to list $1.5 million of municipal funding for Hartman Drive in the 2020-21 Capital Works Budget.</p>

      <p>The council considered a separate report relating to Hester Avenue at the same meeting, noting the Public Transport Authority (PTA) had advised it no longer planned to build a roundabout at the Baltimore Parade junction so it could reinstate a Merriwa bus route.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons given by PTA was that state funding for the $2.4 million project had been <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/wanneroo-times/news/merriwa-roundabout-funding-redirected-to-safety-barriers/">diverted to other projects</a>, including safety barriers on the Mitchell Freeway in the City of Stirling.</p>
      <p>The council voted that the mayor should write to the transport minister with concerns about withdrawal of the project, asking funds to be allocated to projects in the City of Wanneroo, and asking PTA to hold another community information session to advise residents.</p>
      <p>During public questions time, former councillor Glynis Monks raised concerns that the issues for residents entering or exiting RAAFA Cambrai Village via Hester Avenue had not been resolved.</p>
      <p>Ms Monks said traffic volumes would increase significantly with the <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/wanneroo-times/news/companies-sought-to-design-and-build-mitchell-freeway-extension/">freeway extension to Romeo Road</a> not expected to be completed until 2022.</p>
