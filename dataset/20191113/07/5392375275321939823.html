      <p>The new and upgraded Redmi Note 8T replaces the “old” Redmi Note 8 as the handset now features a pretty handy NFC module. All the rest says the same, as does price, this means we have a large 6.3-inch display of Full HD+ resolution with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and FHD+ resolution, for less than $200.</p>
      <p>Powering Xiaomi’s mid-ranger we find the good Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 coupled with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which is expandable via microSD.</p>
      <p>The Redmi Note 8 packs a 48MP main rear camera for extra sharp photos when the subject is well lit, while in darker scenarios the pixels are combined into larger 1.6um ones for better quality. We then have an 8MP secondary with ultra wide lens, a third 2MP sensor for macro shots and a fourth 2MP depth sensor. Meanwhile at the front, we find a 13MP selfie snapper.</p>
      <p>Finally, the smartphone packs a large 4000mAh capacity battery typical of the series and runs MIUI based on Android 9 Pie.</p>
