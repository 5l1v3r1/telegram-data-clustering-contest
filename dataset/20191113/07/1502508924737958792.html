      <h2>India's passive funds have delivered an average return of 9.6 per cent so far this year, much higher than active funds' 5.7 per cent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:40:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:40</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>India's passive index-tracking equity funds are set to beat their active stock-picking counterparts in returns for a second successive year as fund managers grapple with volatility and the challenges of outperforming benchmark indexes.</p>
      <p>According to Refinitiv Lipper data, India's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/passive-funds">passive funds </a>have delivered an average return of 9.6 per cent so far this year, much higher than active funds' 5.7 per cent. In 2018, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/passive-funds">passive funds </a>posted 2.3 per cent gains, while active funds had negative returns.</p>
      <p>Active funds have historically outperformed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/passive-funds">passive funds </a>in India when share price moves were more broad-based and market inefficiencies helped stock pickers as they hunted for shares whose prices were not truly reflective of their worth.</p>
      <p>But India's stock market rally has been much narrower in the past two years, with investors preferring some well-established heavyweights over smaller ones owing to broader uncertainties around a slowing domestic economy and the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
      <p>For instance, the Nifty index has risen 9.67 per cent so far this year, but the Nifty Midcap index has shed 6.2 per cent and the small-cap index has slumped 11.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>Pratik Oswal, head of Passive Funds at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company, said 85 per cent of the Indian stock market had become efficient.</p>
      <p>"Finding mispricings has become harder than it was 5-10 years ago," he said.</p>
      <p>"A sharp correction in mid and small caps, coupled with mega caps becoming larger, has led to underperformance of most active fund managers."</p>
      <p>Also, the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) rules on holdings of large-cap and mid-cap firms have affected the performance of active funds, analysts said.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2017, SEBI said a large-cap equity fund must invest at least 80 per cent of its portfolio in large-cap stocks and mid-cap funds must invest at least 65 per cent in mid caps.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, active fund managers had the flexibility to allocate larger amounts to other categories to boost their funds' performance.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, active funds remain more popular with Indian investors who still haven't taken to index investing, unlike in developed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets.</a></p>
      <p>The passive funds' assets under management (AUM) is lower than that of active funds, according to Refinitiv Lipper data. Active funds' AUM stood at $94.4 billion at the end of third quarter, while passive funds' AUM were just $3.3 billion.</p>
      <p>In the United States, passive funds' AUM stands at more than half of the active funds' AUM, the data showed.</p>
      <p>"We don't have a lot of long-term money flowing into index, the way it does in America or other developed markets," said Dhirendra Kumar, founder and chief executive officer of Value Research.</p>
      <p>"Indian investors have become curious and they are beginning to invest (in passive funds). But I don't think it is very big time."</p>
