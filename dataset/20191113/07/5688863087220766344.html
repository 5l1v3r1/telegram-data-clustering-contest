      <h1>Granit Xhaka deserves lot more respect from Arsenal fans, claims Patrick Vieira</h1>

        <b>Former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira has admitted that Granit Xhaka deserves a lot more respect from the fans than the midfielder has gotten so far. The OGC Nice manager spent the majority of his career in England where he won three Premier League titles and five FA Cups before spells in Italy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After his angry reaction to angry <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/arsenal">Arsenal</a> fans last month former captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/granit_xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a> was stripped of the armband and the 27-year-old hasn’t played for the club since. Not only that rumours and reports have indicated that the Swiss international is considering a move to Italy with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/ac_milan">AC Milan</a> and Inter Milan both considering a move for the midfielder in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>However, while many have criticised Xhaka for his behaviour, former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira has sympathised with the Swiss international and revealed that he deserves more respect. The OGC <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/nice">Nice</a> manager went on to admit that the aftermath and the reaction from a few former players was too harsh and that Xhaka deserved more from the fans.</p>
      <p>“I feel sorry for him because he [was] the captain and he’s going through a really difficult period and really difficult time at Arsenal. I think we have to remind ourselves that he’s achieved a lot since he’s at Arsenal and he deserves a lot of respect. When you’re a player and don’t perform the way you expect, you get frustrated about yourself. And sometimes you say things or do things you regret,” Vieira told British media.</p>
      <p>"I find it really difficult a lot of ex-footballers have jumped on him and being really negative towards him - it's too too easy. I know how good he is and he will come through this difficult period because he's a strong man, he's a good player. And he will show how good he is.''</p>
      <p>With Nice 13 in the league despite losing Mario Baliotelli, Allan Saint-Maximin and a few other stars over the last few months, the former <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/juventus">Juventus</a> star has won plaudits for his managerial style. It’s a style that Vieira honed in the MLS where he spent two years as the manager for New York City before moving to France. That has seen him linked with a move back to the Premier League but the Frenchman admitted that while it would be nice, he’s focused on the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/tournament/ligue_1">Ligue 1</a> for now.</p>
      <p>"You dream about coaching one day in the Premier League. You will want to coach one of the teams that you play for. But you know what I am really focusing at the moment is how we can improve in Nice, to do better in the league,” concluded Vieira.</p>
