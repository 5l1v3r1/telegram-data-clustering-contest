      <h2>Giuliano Morena isn't looking to his personal goal tally but is looking to pull the Coatbridge outfit up the League Two table.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/albion-rovers-boss-hopes-fort-20750015">Albion Rovers</a> midfielder Giuliano Morena says he doesn’t care about scoring his first goal in Scotland - only about the win over Stenhousemuir.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old grabbed the winner against the Warriors last weekend to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/monklands-derby-scottish-cup-clash-20750480">pull the Coatbridge outfit</a> away from the foot of League Two.</p>
      <p>It was Morena’s first strike since swapping Serie D for the Scottish lower league in 2016, but he says the result was all that mattered at Cliftonhill.</p>
      <p>The Italian playmaker said: “I don’t care who scored the goal for me it’s just about the three points.</p>

      <p>“It’s what we needed in the last two months. We have been struggling and it’s so happy for everyone who has been working so hard.</p>
      <p>“We started so well and then we have had a period where we just aren’t getting the results even when we have been playing well. “</p>
      <p>He was keen to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/albion-rovers-boss-hopes-fort-20750015">build on the win with a result against Edinburgh City</a> on Saturday: “We need to build from now and need to take more points starting this weekend.</p>
      <p>“We feel like we should be in a better position rather than just looking at relegation.”</p>
