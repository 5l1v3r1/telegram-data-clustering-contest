      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Mike Hoffman scored one of four Florida goals in the third period and added the winner in a shootout as the Panthers rallied from a four-goal deficit and beat the Boston Bruins 5-4 on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Keith Yandle had a goal and two assists for Florida and Sam Montembeault didn't allow a goal after replacing Sergei Bobrovsky at the start of the third period with the Panthers trailing 4-0.</p>
      <p>Montembeault finished with 15 saves, six in overtime, and stopped Charlie McAvoy on Boston's last chance in the shootout as the Panthers completed the comeback and gave coach Joel Quenneville career victory No. 899.</p>

      <p>The Penguins were without star center Sidney Crosby due to a lower body injury. The two-time MVP did not travel with the team to New York after leaving in the third period of a 3-2 shootout win over Chicago on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Rookie defenseman Cale Makar opened the scoring for the Avalanche (11-5-2). Joonas Donskoi had a goal and two assists, and Matt Calvert contributed a pair of assists.</p>
      <p>It was the first time this season the Jets (10-8-1) were shut out.</p>

      <p>After Ducks defensemen Brendan Guhle and Korbinian Holzer took penalties 21 seconds apart in the waning moments of regulation, Larkin scored from a sharp angle while the Red Wings had three extra skaters on the ice with their goalie pulled.</p>
      <p>Cholowski then got his second goal of the season on a long shot past Ryan Miller, who made 32 saves for Anaheim.</p>
      <p>Jakob Silfverberg, Josh Mahura and Cam Fowler scored in the second period for the Ducks. Ondrej Kase and Adam Henrique had two assists apiece, but Anaheim lost for the first time in seven games this season when scoring at least three goals.</p>
      <p>Filip Hronek and Andreas Athanasiou scored in the second period for the Red Wings, and Jonathan Bernier stopped 24 shots against his former team.</p>
