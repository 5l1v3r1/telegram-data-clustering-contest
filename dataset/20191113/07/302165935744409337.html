      <p>IPOH, Nov 13 — A tanker carrying fuel caught fire at Km265 North-South Expressway (PLUS) (north-bound) before the Menora Tunnel this morning causing traffic congestion.</p>
      <p>The Perak Fire and Rescue Department spokesman said they received a call about the incident at 11.16am today before dispatching machinery and firemen from Meru Raya fire station to the scene.</p>
      <p>He said on arrival, they found that the tanker was 60 per cent burnt.</p>
      <p>“Other than Meru Raya fire station, the fire-extinguishing operation was assisted by personnel and machinery from Kuala Kangsar and Ipoh fire station,” he said in a statement here today.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a PLUS spokeswoman advised those heading to the north to use the alternative route by exiting at the Ipoh Selatan toll plaza as the traffic is currently congested quite heavily.</p>
      <p>“For the northbound, PLUS has closed part of the road near the scene of the fire, while for the southbound the right lane was closed to facilitate the fire-extinguishing operation,” she told Bernama. — Bernama</p>
