        <b>Teaching is a popular career for newcomers to Sweden, in part thanks to a large number of international schools where lessons take place in English. We've taken a look at the numbers to calculate how much you can expect to earn as a teacher in Sweden, both before and after tax.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The average monthly salary for a preschool teacher in Sweden is 30,500 kronor before tax, which rises to 33,900 kronor for primary school teachers and 36,300 kronor for secondary school teachers.</p>
      <p>Special needs teachers earn an average monthly salary of 38,600 kronor while for teachers aides the average is 24,300 kronor per month.</p>
      <p>For comparison, the average salary in Sweden across all sectors was 34,600 kronor before tax in 2018.</p>
      <p>Women, on average, earn 30,600 kronor per month as preschool teachers compared to a figure of 28,800 for men. The figures for primary school teachers are 34,200 kronor for women and 33,100 for men, and for secondary school teachers these rise to 36,400 for women and 36,100 for men.</p>
      <p>Age and education level can also play a role in the salary you're likely to take home.</p>
      <p>The age group earning the most as preschool teachers is the 55-64-year-old category, with a monthly average of 32,400 kronor, while the highest earning age groups for primary and secondary school teachers was the age group of 65-66 years, with monthly salaries of 36,300 kronor for primary school and 38,300 kronor for secondary school.</p>
      <p>Teachers in the 18-24 age group earn the least on average, with monthly salaries of 22,700 kronor for preschool teachers, 24,200 kronor for primary school teachers, and 25,600 kronor for secondary school teachers.</p>
      <p>As for how much of this salary you would actually take home, we crunched the numbers using Swedish tax office <a href="https://skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/betalaochfatillbaka/raknautdinskatt.4.309a41aa1672ad0c837436a.html">Skatteverket's calculator</a>.</p>
      <p>Your tax rate <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181030/this-map-makes-it-easy-to-compare-tax-rates-across-sweden">depends on a few factors</a>, including where you live, so we looked at the figures for a 35-year-old living in Stockholm. To calculate the rates, we also assumed that most of our readers who grew up outside of Sweden will not be paying members of the Swedish Church, so would not pay towards Sweden's church tax.</p>
      <p>Other factors may play a role in your tax bill, so these calculations can be used as a guide but may not be exact.</p>
      <p>Based on this, a 35-year-old preschool teacher earning 30,500 kronor a month would take home 23,791 kronor after tax in 2019. For a primary school teacher earning 34,500 kronor in Stockholm (the average salary for the 35-44 age group), the take-home sum would be 26,618 kronor, while a secondary school teacher earning the average salary of 36,000 kronor a month in Stockholm could expect their net paycheck to amount to 27,698 kronor per month in 2019. </p>
