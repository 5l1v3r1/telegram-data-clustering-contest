      <h1>Panipat song 'Mard Maratha' celebrates Maratha pride and triumph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:28:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:28</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>After the grand trailer launch of Ashutosh Gowarikar's dream project, '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Panipat">Panipat</a>', the makers today dropped the film's first song, 'Mard Maratha'. The song celebrates the pride and prestige of the Maratha empire and shows the unity within the Peshwa family.</p>
      <p>In the song, we can see all the major characters from the period drama, coming together and celebrating the success of the Maratha empire which was well-flourished in our nation then. We can also see Parvati Bai, portrayed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Sanon">Kriti Sanon</a> expressing her love towards Sadashiv Rao (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arjun-Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a>). Parvati Bai not only expresses her love towards the prince but also shows how courageous can Maratha women be when in need. The song shows the glorious days of Shanivaar Wada and we must say Ashutosh Gowarikar has done it again.</p>
      <p>Sung by well-known singers like Atul Gogawale, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sudesh-Bhosle">Sudesh Bhosle</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kunal-Ganjawala">Kunal Ganjawala</a>, Swapnil Bandodkar, Padmanabh Gaikwad, and Priyanka Barve, the song is composed by Ajay-Atul and is penned by the famous <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Javed-Akhtar">Javed Akhtar</a>. 'Mard Maratha' turns out be a well-packed melodious yet heart-thumping track of the film which will surely give goose-bumps to the masses.</p>
