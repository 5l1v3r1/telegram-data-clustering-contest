      <h1>EXPLAINER: Important things to know about Nigeria's 'Hate Speech' bill - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:10:04+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/362633-explainer-important-things-to-know-about-nigerias-hate-speech-bill.html" target="_blank">QueenEsther Iroanusi</a></address>
      <p>The Senate on Tuesday reintroduced a bill that seeks to penalise persons found guilty of hate speech.</p>
      <p>The National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill was sponsored by the deputy chief whip, Aliyu Abdullahi.</p>
      <p>It prescribes death penalty for anyone found guilty of spreading a falsehood that leads to the death of another person.</p>
      <p>The bill also seeks the establishment of a National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Specch to help investigate and prosecute offenders.</p>
      <p>A similar bill was introduced to the Senate on March 2018 for consideration and passage. It however, did not make it through to third reading.</p>
      <p>The reintroduction of the bill has generated controversies among Nigerians.</p>
      <p>Some civic groups have kicked against the bill because of its narrow and unclear definition of what constitutes hate speech.</p>
      <p>They say the provisions of the bill would be contrary to the Nigerian Constitution if the bill becomes law as designed.</p>
      <p>The Constitution protects the rights to unhindered speech, expression and association.</p>
      <p>A former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has also cautioned Nigerian senators against moves to pass the bill.</p>
      <p>He said the freedom of speech and other key elements of civil liberties which Nigerians enjoyed between 1999 and 2015 should not be taken away by the current administration.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers are expected to debate the details of the bill on another legislative day.</p>
