      <p>Clinton, who already had her chance against Donald Trump in 2016, has refused to rule out the possibility of a 2020 run.</p>
      <blockquote>“I, as I say, never, never, never say never,” Clinton told BBC Radio 5 Live. However, “I will certainly tell you, I’m under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it.”</blockquote>
      <p>However, she insisted she was not planning on a run — at the moment.</p>
      <blockquote>“But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>Clinton would join a crowded Democratic field with former vice president Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren topping most early polls for the nomination. Among the Republicans, Trump remains the frontrunner for the 2020 nomination.</p>
