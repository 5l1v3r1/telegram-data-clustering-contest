With Amar Kaushik's comedy-drama, 'Bala' revolving around a man suffering from premature balding turning out to be Ayushmann's biggest opener of his career is continuing to weave its magic at the box office. <b><br/></b><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/bala/movie-review/71958951.cms"><b>Bala Movie Review : Bald is beautiful, indeed</b></a></p>
      <p>According to the latest report on Boxofficeindia.com, the film has managed to mint another Rs 9.25 crore on its first Tuesday which has taken the total of the film to a staggering figure of Rs 59.50 crores.</p>

      <p>Talking about how she feels about bald men in real life, Yami opened up saying "I feel bald men are really cool. They look really cool. The idea of the film is to tell people that they should love themselves first, and only then can you expect others to love you," while interacting with the media after a special screening of 'Bala' in Mumbai.</p>
