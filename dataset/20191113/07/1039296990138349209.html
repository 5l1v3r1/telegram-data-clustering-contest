      <p>All-electric SUV will also come with an AC home charger; to be launched in January 2020.</p>
      <p>There is much anticipation about MG Motor’s second product for India, the ZS EV, ahead of <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/india-spec-mg-zs-ev-to-be-revealed-on-december-5-414785"><b>its reveal on December 5</b></a>. <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mg-zs-ev-bookings-to-commence-from-late-december-2019-414741"><b>Bookings for the all-electric SUV</b></a> will also commence next month, with the launch set to take place in January 2020.</p>
      <p>As is known, the ZS EV is expected to pack a 150hp electric motor and a 44.5kWh lithium-ion battery that’s capable of delivering a claimed range of 335km on the older NEDC test cycle and 262km on the newer WLTP testing procedure. Charging times are pegged at 7 hours using a 7kW AC charger, and 40min (from 0-80 percent) using a 50kW DC fast charger.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Autocar India in a recent interview, Rajeev Chaba, president and managing director, MG Motor India, confirmed that buyers of the ZS EV will get access to free DC fast charging for a certain period from the purchase of the vehicle. This will be available at all MG fast-charging locations in the five cities that the ZS EV will be sold in, namely Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad.</p>
      <p>As standard, MG will provide an AC charger with the ZS EV. Earlier this year, the manufacturer teamed up with Delta Electronics India, who will install the AC chargers either at the buyer’s home or office, as per their convenience. </p>
      <p>MG will bring the ZS EV to India via the CKD (Completely knocked down) route, in order to keep prices competitive. Expected to be around the Rs 22 lakh mark (ex-showroom), the ZS EV will compete with the Hyundai Kona Electric that’s priced at Rs 23.71 lakh. We’ve <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/mg-zs-ev-prototype-review-test-drive-414180"><b>also reviewed a pre-production model of the ZS EV</b></a> earlier this year.</p>
