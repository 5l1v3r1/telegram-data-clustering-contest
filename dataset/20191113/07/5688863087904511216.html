        <b>Australia cricket international Marnus Labuschagne has expressed that the journey to becoming a household name with the Ashes fame has been long with major ups and downs. The 25-year-old has credited his County Championship stint with Glamorgan helped him with English conditions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The South Africa-born Aussie batsman chose to keep behind his doubts of becoming a recognized batsman and since then he invested himself in the long process to get to the form of his career. </p>
      <p>"There is a long, long process to this. It didn't just happen overnight and everything just magically clicked," Labuschagne was quoted as saying by Nine Publishing.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne revealed that the ups and downs have helped him figure out what is required to make it back to the forefront after every bad phase.</p>
      <p>"You have to go through the ups and downs of Shield cricket to understand what it requires to keep coming back. You have to go through the highs and the lows to fully grasp how to become a better player. There will be many more of both but if you can understand that early, you are better placed to take the chances when they arrive," he unveiled.</p>
      <p>Before joining the Australia squad in the Ashes, the batsman played 20 matches across formats for Glamorgan and scored more than 1,000 runs in one year. The Aussie has heavily credited his time in England, getting accustomed to the English conditions ahead of the Ashes. </p>
      <p>"The biggest difference for me in England was going over and learning to play your game in the middle, not playing your game in the nets. I think that was something I struggled with a bit, I always felt like I had to hit a ton of balls because I wasn't getting that time in the middle,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Glamorgan coach Matthew Maynard has revealed how he got Labuschagne to improve one of his technique and get to a brilliant form.</p>
      <p>"For me his bat path wasn't great. It wasn't coming down on the line of the ball. His was coming from a little wider. The reason for that was (the position of) his hip and his back leg. So we addressed that balance to keep his hips a little more side on and therefore keeping that back foot parallel to the crease,” Maynard told cricket.com.au.</p>
      <p>"All of a sudden that righted the bat path to the ball."</p>
