      <h1>Cycle &amp; Carriage shares up for second straight day on privatisation offer</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 13): Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Bhd's (CCB) share price extended gains for the second consecutive day today, rising as much as 26.4% since opening this morning, after its major shareholder proposed to take the company private at RM2.20 per share.</p>
      <p>At 3.20pm, the counter was up 43 sen or 25.75% at RM2.10, with 993,600 shares done. This brings its market capitalisation to RM211.56 million.</p>
      <p>At this juncture, the proposed offer represents a 4.8% upside.</p>
      <p>The stock has surged some 64% from last Friday's closing price of RM1.29. Trading was suspended on Monday pending the announcement. Prior to this privatisation offer, the counter was trading between RM1.24 and RM1.61 this year.</p>
      <p>CCB's controlling shareholder Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage Ltd had proposed a selective capital repayment and reduction at RM2.20 per share compared with its last traded price of RM1.29 â€” the lowest level since April 2009.</p>
      <p>The proposed selective capital repayment and reduction will pave the way for the privatisation of the automotive player, whose share price has been on a downhill trend in the past five years amid dismal earnings performance.</p>
      <p>CCB said the capital repayment will provide minority shareholders a "clean cash exit opportunity" from their investments in the auto group.</p>
