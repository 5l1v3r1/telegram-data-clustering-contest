      <h1>Reports | Tottenham fear Mauricio Pochettino cannot salvage their season</h1>

        <b>After another disappointing result at home Tottenham sit in 12 place and the belief around the club is that Mauricio Pochettino might not be able to save their season. The Argentine has been under heavy scrutiny this season with Spurs struggling to perform and the club are considering other options.</b>

      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is on his way towards the point of no return with Tottenham and the club’s hierarchy fear that the Argentine may not be able to find his way back the Telegraph has reported. The report further added that Tottenham’s clash against <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/west_ham_united">West Ham United</a>, after the international break, has been upgraded to a make or break situation for the club and their manager.</p>
      <p>The North London side sit in 12th place and are already 11 points off fourth which has caused a few in the board to sit up and consider a future without Pochettino. But the former <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/southampton">Southampton</a> manager has already warned the club that there is no short fix to their issues and has urged the board to give him time. Yet the Telegraph further reported that it would cost around £12.5 million to sack the Argentine and that’s a fee that chairman Daniel Levy doesn’t want to pay.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, with no interim option, it would make things complicated for the club and that's not what Tottenham want right now reports have further revealed. While there have been links to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/jose_mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> and Max Allegri, the club want to shy away from any panic moves and are considering giving Pochettino till the end of the season. That, the Telegraph has reported, would then give them a chance to approach <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/rb_leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> boss Julian Nagelsmann, England manager Gareth Southgate or Bournemouth's Eddie Howe.</p>
