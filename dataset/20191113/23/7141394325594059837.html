      <p>A YouTube channel called “Crypto World” has reportedly been spreading malware by baiting viewers with promises of free Bitcoin addresses.</p>
      <p>Twitter user hxFrost broke the alleged scam which utilizes the “Predator the Thief” Trojan to steal data from victims.</p>

      <p>According to Lawrence Abrams, a computer forensics expert and the founder of <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/youtube-bitcoin-videos-pushing-predator-info-stealing-trojan/">BleepingComputer.com</a>, the YouTube account hosts videos that advertise a program that allegedly cracks Bitcoin addresses by generating private keys. But the software actually infects victims with the data-stealing Trojan.</p>
      <p>Says Abrams,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“In the video’s description will also be links to download the trojanized program from Yandex, Google Drive, and Mega.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>The file being offered is called Crypto World.zip and when extracted contains a setup.exe file, which includes a password-protected ZIP file containing the Predator the Thief executable.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The file will install and execute the Trojan on a computer.</p>
      <p>Kapersky Lab <a href="https://securelist.com/a-predatory-tale/89779/">reports</a> that the Predator Trojan was designed and is sold cheaply by Russian-speaking individuals. It’s been detected numerous times in the wild, according to the cybersecurity firm.</p>
      <p>Says Abrams,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Once running, Predator the Thief will communicate with the malware’s command and control server to download further components, other malware, and to send information back to the attackers.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>This Trojan can steal a variety of information and passwords from a computer, including copying the victim’s clipboard, recording over the webcam, and stealing files from the victim.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The malware is also sold on hacking and game cheating forums, reports <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/predator-the-thief-new-routes-delivery.html">Fortinet</a>.</p>
