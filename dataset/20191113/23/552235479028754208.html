      <h1>Shocking new Rangers tax case claim suggests club did not need to suffer implosion</h1>
      <h2>A report has detailed administration did not need to occur.</h2>

      <p>The financial implosion that hit <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and led to liquidation did not need to occur, it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow club suffered meltdown in 2012 when a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tax">tax bill</a> became so mammoth creditors could not be paid.</p>
      <p>But a shocking new report has stated Armageddon could have been averted - and that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) blundered in its calculations.</p>
      <p>It has been reported by <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/">The Times</a> the former company that ran the Ibrox club are set to have £50million wiped off its tax bill after HMRC acknowledged it had claimed too big an amount.</p>

      <p>It centres around former Rangers owner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/david-murray">Sir David Murray</a>'s use of EBTs, a tax avoidance scheme. The businessman later sold the club to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-whyte">Craig Whyte</a> for just £1 before financial ruin was to strike.</p>
      <p>According to the report, accountancy experts now believe the amount owed by the club stood at £20m, a figure it has been suggested was more manageable and one that would not have triggered administration.</p>
      <p>Former Rangers chairman John McClelland, as quoted in the report, believes the nightmarish outcome would not have befallen the club had the tax bill been smaller.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "At the time of the sale of the club in 2011, had the tax claim been at the level now being reported then in my opinion, the outcome would have been different.</p>
      <p>"I believe there would have certainly been a much higher level of interest of acquiring it and therefore more potential buyers."</p>
