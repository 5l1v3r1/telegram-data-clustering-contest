      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee will hold a Nov. 20 hearing on the testing and deployment of self-driving vehicles that will include top U.S. safety officials, as Congress has struggled to pass legislation on autonomous vehicles.</p>

      <p>The hearing will come one day after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) meets to determine the probable cause of a March 2018 Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle crash that killed a pedestrian in Arizona.</p>
      <p>Documents made public by the NTSB last week show Uber’s system had significant flaws and was not programmed to detect a jaywalking pedestrian.</p>
      <p>The hearing will include NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt, acting National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator (NHTSA) James Owens, and top U.S. Transportation Department policy official Joel Szabat.</p>
      <p>The NTSB may use the findings from the first fatal self-driving car accident to make recommendations that could affect how the entire industry addresses self-driving software issues, or to regulators about how to better oversee the industry.</p>
      <p>Congress has debated for more than two years whether to revise federal regulations to speed the introduction of self-driving cars. Last month, the Senate Commerce and House Energy and Commerce committees circulated a discussion draft of a self-driving car bill.</p>
      <p>NHTSA said in October 2018 it was moving ahead with efforts to revise safety rules that bar self-driving cars from the roads without human controls like steering wheels and pedals.</p>
      <p>At the same time, NHTSA is still trying to figure out how to oversee self-driving cars under existing rules.</p>
      <p>General Motors Co in January 2018 petitioned NHTSA for a temporary waiver to deploy a ride-sharing fleet of driverless cars without steering wheels or other human controls. In March 2019, NHTSA made the petition public for comment, but it has not acted on the request.</p>
      <p>In July, GM’s self-driving unit, Cruise, said it was delaying commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019, saying more testing was required.</p>
      <p>Some in Congress have raised concerns about the lack of NHTSA oversight of self-driving car software systems before they are deployed for testing.</p>
      <p>Last week, the NTSB said the Uber test vehicle failed to properly identify 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as a pedestrian walking a bicycle across a street. The fatal accident prompted fresh safety concerns about the nascent self-driving car industry.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Uber said the company regretted the crash that killed Herzberg and noted it has “adopted critical program improvements to further prioritize safety.”</p>
