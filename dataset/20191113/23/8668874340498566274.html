      <h1>Wasps' Paolo Odogwu's ban for flying kick will sideline him until Christmas</h1>

      <p>Wasps winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/paolo-odogwu/">Paolo Odogwu</a> has been handed a six-week ban for kicking an opponent in the head.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was sent off by referee Tom Foley after catching Rohan Van Rensburg with a boot to the face when jumping to catch the ball in the 79th minute of his side’s 28-18 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> defeat at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> last Friday.</p>

      <p>Odogwu admitted the charge when he appeared before an independent disciplinary panel in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol">Bristol</a> on Wednesday evening and was banned until December 23.</p>
      <p>Hearing chairman Dan White said: “The panel did not accept the player’s explanation that his leg extended to assist his balance in the air and prevent him from falling backward.</p>
      <p>“The panel found that, while he did not intentionally aim to make contact with the Sale player’s face, he did intend to use his outstretched leg to fend off a potential oncoming player and was reckless as to whether or not it made contact or caused injury.</p>

      <p>“In this case the dangerous action of the player resulted in a minor injury to the Sale player.</p>
      <p>“In our opinion this was nevertheless a top end entry point; his disrespectful behaviour to the referee and crowd, after receiving the red card, only served to reinforce our view.</p>
      <p>“His behaviour reflected poorly on the player and the game as a whole.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bath winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/aled-brew/">Aled Brew</a> has been given a three-week ban following his dismissal in last Saturday’s win over Northampton.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> international, who was sent off for striking <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/george-furbank/">George Furbank</a>, will miss Bath’s opening Heineken Champions Cup clash with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> on Saturday and is free to play again from December 3.</p>
