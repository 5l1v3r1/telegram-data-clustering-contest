      <h1>What Harry Kane said about Fikayo Tomori after England's training session ahead of Montenegro</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea defender raised eyebrows with his display in training</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:32:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kane congratulated Fikayo Tomori after the Chelsea defender's exploits in training ahead of the European Championship qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The centre-back was called up to Gareth Southgate's 27-man squad after establishing himself as one of Chelsea's most consistent players this season.</p>
      <p>Tomori, who spent last season on loan at Derby and won the Rams' Player of the Season award, has been an ever present for the Blues in the Premier League since the 2-2 draw with Sheffield United in August.</p>
      <p>Lampard previously praised the 21-year-old for his mature performances and said it was an easy decision to put the defender into the team.</p>
      <p>"He’s definitely got personality. That grew last year at Derby. He became very popular in the dressing room, and popular with the fans for his performances.</p>
      <p>"The progression is huge, but the main thing I saw in him was work ethic. He quietly goes about his business. He trains hard. Everything you ask him to do, he tries to do it and more.</p>
      <p>"Physically he’s great, we know that. He’s one of those when you’re doing sprinting or running, or heavy running early season, you can see every day he’s nailed, he does the job.</p>
      <p>"When you want to do a particular training session, something quite simple but which takes a bit of focus, he’s focused and ready to go.</p>
      <p>"That has shown in his performances since he stepped into the team. I put trust him early in the season, and at the moment he’s really delivered. Long may that continue, because there is more to come from him."</p>
      <p>England posted a video of Tomori on their Instagram account on Tuesday, with the caption: '@fikayotomori = hat-trick hero', after the defender fired a treble in training.</p>

      <p>And Kane, who will lead the side out against Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday, was spotted on the clip walking over to congratulate the young Chelsea defender.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham striker also said to the camera: "Hat trick man," as he followed Tomori off the pitch at the end of the session.</p>
