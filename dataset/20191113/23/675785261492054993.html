      <h2>Kate Griffiths said her relationship with disgraced husband Andrew ended “on the day” he was exposed by the Sunday Mirror after sending a barmaid and her pal £700 and offering to rent a flat to meet for sex</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:20:40+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>The estranged  wife of a former minister exposed by the Sunday Mirror for sending thousands of sexts while she was at home looking after their daughter has said she won’t accept his support after replacing him as a Tory candidate.</p>
      <p>Kate Griffiths said her relationship with disgraced husband Andrew ended “on the day” he was exposed by the Sunday Mirror after sending a barmaid and her pal £700 and offering to rent a flat to meet for sex.</p>
      <p>In a seeming act of revenge, she has replaced him as the Conservative’s candidate in Burton and Uttoxeter.</p>
      <p>Mrs Griffiths said in a statement: “The divorce is being finalised.</p>
      <p>“I am not able to say more about this now as legal proceedings are ongoing but I want to make it clear that I have not sought, nor do I accept, Andrew’s offer of political support.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, Mr Griffith’s association voted on readopting him as their candidate, but it ended in a tie 117-117.  His wife was not allowed to speak in that meeting.</p>

      <p>A constituency insider told the Mirror: “She is furious, and quite rightly, and he was terrified of what she would reveal about him.  It was like an episode of Emmerdale.”</p>
      <p>The decision not to back him triggered a selection contest, which saw Mrs Griffiths add herself to the shortlist.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffiths then announced he was standing down, hours before his wife won the selection.</p>
      <p>Tory campaign insiders described the result as “vengeance” and said that the former MP had been told to pull out before the second meeting.</p>
      <p>Speaking yesterday, Mrs Griffiths said she had emerged from the episode stronger.</p>
      <p>“In the past 18 months I have found strength and resilience which I didn’t know I had, borne out of self-respect, dignity and the fierce desire to protect my daughter,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffiths sent 2,000 texts in all, referring to himself as “Daddy” and outlining sex acts.</p>
