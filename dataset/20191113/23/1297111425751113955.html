      <h1>Dryer fire causes evacuation of daycare in Regina home</h1>
      <h2>"We've practiced fire drills, and we had all the kids get their coats on and went right outside."</h2>

      <p>For Lisa Stretten, what began as a regular day of looking after the children in her home-based daycare quickly became a test of her evacuation protocol after her dryer burst into flames.</p>
      <p>Stretten had some socks in the dryer Wednesday morning when she heard the machine making strange sounds, and noticed the drum wasn’t spinning. Instead, it just kept heating up. She said she opened the door, peered inside and saw that the back of the dryer was a “burning red” colour.</p>
      <p>“Then it just went on fire,” she said.</p>
      <p>Grabbing a fire extinguisher she kept nearby, Stretten attempted to put the fire out herself, but quickly realized she couldn’t reach all the flames. With the smoke alarm ringing, she and her one employee quickly evacuated the seven kids from the basement where the daycare was located. Stretten’s husband and son were upstairs at the time of the fire, and also got out safely.</p>
      <p>“We’ve practiced fire drills, and we had all the kids get their coats on and went right outside,” said Stretten. “They were a little shook up, but they were fine.”</p>
      <p>Regina Fire &amp; Protective Services quickly responded to the call at the home in the 2300 block of Wallace Street. The children were kept warm in a fire department van and given teddy bears by firefighters, while Stretten called the parents and let them know what had happened. She said the fire was contained to the dryer, but smoke permeated the whole house.</p>
      <p>Brandy Webb, whose daughter Sloan was in the daycare, said getting the call about the fire was “every parent’s nightmare,” but that things didn’t turn out badly in the end.</p>
      <p>“The kids were rushed out immediately and all has been taken care of, and so I think they handled it very well and very professionally, and I’m just really grateful that everyone is OK,” Webb said.</p>
      <p>“They all got teddy bears … It was kind of almost like an adventure for them.”</p>

        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/sask-officials-urge-family-fire-safety-14-fire-related-deaths-last-year">The quick and safe evacuation of everyone from the home is a testament to the importance of having a fire escape plan in place and practised — a theme the provincial government stressed last month during Fire Prevention Week.</a>
      </p>
      <p>There were 14 deaths caused by fire in Saskatchewan in the fiscal year 2018-19. Residential properties were the site of 93 per cent of those fatalities, and the province urged residents to create and practise a fire escape plan for their homes.</p>
      <p>Sarah Booth, whose son Francis was in the daycare, was also pleased with how the fire was handled.</p>
      <p>“It sounds like all of the things that are supposed to happen in these situations, happened,” she said. “It’s a fretful kind of situation, but then you have all those protocols and things in place to make sure everybody’s safe, and it sounds like that’s what happened.”</p>
      <p>While both parents are hopeful their child can return to the daycare soon, Stretten said she isn’t sure how long it will take to reopen her home.</p>
      <p>“I just have to figure out what to do with my business until everything’s fixed up and ready to go,” she said.</p>
