      <h1>Angry pest threatened to kill ex and her new man after they announced relationship on Facebook</h1>
      <h2>Storm Simpson, of South Shields, has been jailed after leaving voice messages saying 'you are dead' and flouting a restraining order</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>A new couple received death threats from an ex-partner after announcing their relationship on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Storm Simpson had already flouted a court order aimed at keeping him away from his former girlfriend when he left voice messages warning her and her new man "you are dead".</p>
      <p>A court heard the woman believed her 39-year-old ex would carry out his threats and she was left feeling frightened and "on edge".</p>
      <p>Now Simpson, of Marshall Wallis Road, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-shields">South Shields</a>, has been jailed for 12 months at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court.</a></p>
      <p>In a victim impact statement, his ex said: "He has made threats to kill my partner and me and I honestly believe he his capable of carrying out the threats.</p>
      <p>"He was angry. I fear he will come to my home and harm me and my partner. I am living in fear.</p>
      <p>"I am scared by the threats he made. They have left me distressed and on edge. I don't want any contact from him."</p>
      <p>The court heard Simpson was given a restraining order in May after he smashed a Virgin Media box worth £110 at his ex's home.</p>
      <p>Since then he had been convicted four times of breaching it by turning up at her house or speaking to her in the street.</p>
      <p>Just a month before the death threats he had been given a suspended prison term as a result of the repeated breaches. </p>
      <p>Simpson admitted two charges of making a threat to kill and one of breach of a restraining order.</p>
      <p>Recorder David Kelly told him: "It is clear you have found it difficult to accept the end of the relationship and you have repeatedly breached the restraining order.</p>
      <p>"I have concluded, I am afraid, this breach, set against the background of previous breaches, is so serious only a custodial sentence can be justified."</p>
      <p>Liam O'Brien, defending, said Simpson, who has been employed as a cleaner while in custody on remand, has worked well and completed courses to try and help him stay out of trouble in future.</p>
      <p>Mr O'Brien added: "This is clearly a man who has deficits in his thinking skills.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't want to go out and keep breaching the order. He doesn't think it's a good idea to do so but he just can't stop himself."</p>
