      <h1>Cumnock appoint Tony McInally as new manager</h1>
      <h2>The West Region Premiership side have moved swiftly to replace Paul Burns who resigned at the weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:08:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:08</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Paterson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/colin-paterson/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Cumnock</a> have tonight appointed former Pollok and Shotts Bon Accord boss Tony McInally as their new manager.</p>
      <p>The West Region Premiership side have moved quickly to replace Paul Burns who ended his Townhead Park reign at the weekend.</p>
      <p>McInally will oversee training tomorrow night and take charge for the first time on Saturday when 'Nock visit Rossvale.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Burns called it quits following the 3-2 defeat at West Region League One Girvan in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old had been in charge of his hometown club for just under a year and was still a regular in the matchday squad.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, the former Queen of the South midfielder has been unable to turn around the fortunes of 'Nock who lie in 12th place in the table.</p>
      <p>A club statement issued this evening read: "The club is delighted to announce that Tony McInally will be our new manager.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Tony is a vastly-experienced manager and has won every major honour in the Juniors. We hope this continues at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-junior-football-association">Cumnock.</a></p>
      <p>"The club would like to thank ex-Lugar Boswell Thistle boss Lauchlan Millar who is overseeing training this week. Tony will attend training Thursday and take charge on Saturday away to Rossvale."</p>
      <p>McInally's appointment at Cumnock follows on from Robert Scott being installed this week as Kilbirnie Ladeside's new gaffer, replacing Liam McGuinness who stood down last month.</p>
