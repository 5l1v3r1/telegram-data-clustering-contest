      <h1>Essex street has 12 hairdressers in just 400 metres thanks to 'TOWIE effect'</h1>
      <h2>The Only Way is Essex effect has led to a boom of barber shops and hairdressers opening up in Chelmsford, Essex</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:30:17+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Louie Smith, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A street may have the most ­hairdressing shops in the shortest distance in Britain – with 12 salons and barbers in a 400-metre stretch.</p>
      <p>Locals say people trying to copy stars – including those on TOWIE – have caused more stores to open on Moulsham Street in Chelmsford, Essex.</p>
      <p>The reality show is mainly filmed in the nearby town of Brentwood but many scenes are also shot in the city.</p>
      <p>Daniel Foulds, 32, who is assistant manager of Mitchells Barbers, said: “Image is a big thing. Self-grooming is on the rise and people want to look like them and celebrities like David Beckham.</p>
      <p>“Male grooming just gets bigger and bigger. Now especially with social media they want to look the best they can.”</p>

      <p>Brogan Gregory, 27, of MACK ­hairdressers, said some clients want to copy the show’s styles but others are more interested in a “classic look”.</p>
      <p>She said: “So many people want that Essex look but we are more of a classic salon. If you want big hair we can do that but we try to offer something different.”</p>

      <p>Daniel added business is still booming despite an abundance of hairdressers.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was told either go into ­hairdressing or undertaking because everyone’s hair grows and everyone dies.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been here 17 years and we’ve never felt a recession.”</p>
