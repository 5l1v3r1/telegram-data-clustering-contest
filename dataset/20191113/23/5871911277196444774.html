      <p>The Patriots are known for having athletic linebackers, and Jamie Collins surely is no exception.</p>
      <p>Even at 30 years of age, Collins is still excellent in coverage, being able to track even the quickest running backs downfield.</p>
      <p>He’s also a bit of a gymnast apparently.</p>
      <p>Collins showed off that side of his skill set randomly at practice, when, out of nowhere, he just randomly jumped off a blocking sled and did a backflip — landing it perfectly.</p>

      <p>The Patriots coaching staff probably isn’t thrilled about one of their best players showing off in a way that could jeopardize his health, but to Collins’ credit, he did land it.</p>
