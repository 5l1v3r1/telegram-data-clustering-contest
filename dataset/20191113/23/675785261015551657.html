      <h1>Ex-Tory Cabinet Minister warns Johnson majority would trigger no-deal Brexit</h1>
      <h2>Ex-Justice Secretary David Gauke suggested Tory supporters opposed to quitting the EU without an agreement should consider 'lending' their votes to the Lib Dems</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:20:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>A former Tory Cabinet Minister has warned a Conservative general election majority would trigger a "disastrous" no-deal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>Ex-Justice Secretary David Gauke suggested Tory supporters opposed to quitting the EU without an agreement should consider "lending" their votes to the Lib Dems on December 12.</p>
      <p>Mr Gauke, who had the Tory whip withdrawn by Mr Johnson after rebelling over Brexit in September, confirmed he would stand as an independent in South West Hertfordshire - the seat he has held since 2005.</p>
      <p>He feared if Mr Johnson was returned with an overall majority it would lead to Britain leaving the EU without a trade pact with Brussels when a transition period ends in December 2020.</p>

      <p>"A Conservative majority after the next <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit," he told the BBC.</p>
      <p>"In all likelihood at the end of 2020 we will leave the implementation period without a deal with the EU, on WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms - in effect, on no-deal terms.</p>
      <p>“That, I believe, would be disastrous for the prosperity of this country - whole sectors would become unviable."</p>
      <p>Even if Mr Johnson wanted to extend the transition period to allow more time to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU, he would be unable to do so, Mr Gauke claimed.</p>
      <p>"I think in reality the Prime Minister is so boxed in that the Conservative Party would not allow him to extend the implementation period even if he wanted to - and he shows no signs of wanting to do so," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Gauke said he did not identify as a Lib Dem, but suggested Tory supporters consider voting for Jo Swinson's party in some seats to thwart of a Conservative majority.</p>
      <p>"I'm impressed by Jo Swinson. I think if I was living in a lot of constituencies I would lend my vote to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> ," he said.</p>
