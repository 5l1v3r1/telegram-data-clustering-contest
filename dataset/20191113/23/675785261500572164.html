      <p>The singer, 26, looked typically suave in a white collarless shirt unbuttoned to tease his hunky physique while he paraded his beautiful girlfriend, 18, on his arm.</p>
      <p>Maya was impossible to miss in a red suit which had a daring cut to reveal her cleavage.</p>
      <p>The hot pair wrapped their arms around each other when they put on an affectionate display for everyone to see.</p>

      <p>Also the former One Direction star has been name checking his ex Cheryl in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The father-of-one enthused sincerely that he hoped his former flame was happy.</p>

      <p>He elaborated: “I hope she’s happy, she deserves it, she’s a great mum, she works hard, she deserves to find happiness.”</p>
