      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Foreign Minister Shah Mehmodd Qureshi on Wednesday said the attitude of PML-N shows that Nawaz Sharif will never come back. He said PML-N should not make Nawaz’ health a political issue.</p>
      <p>Talking in Dunya News program “ Dunya Kamran Khan Kay Sath,” he said government took decision viewing all legal aspects in a matter pertaining to Nawaz’ removal from ECL so that he can go abroad for treatment.</p>
      <p>Qureshi said Nawaz Sharif is convicted in one case and there is no example of convicts moving abroad. He said government has not created any hurdle in treatment of Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>He said PML-N must not make this a big issue as Nawaz has assets worth billions. He said PML-N can challenge this decision in court if they did not like it.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Ministry of Interior issued a memorandum allowing former prime minister Nawaz Sharif a one-time conditional permission to go abroad for medical treatment for 4 weeks only.</p>
      <p>The letter states that the former prime minister will be allowed to travel abroad if he furnishes an indemnity bond as following:-</p>
      <ol>
        <li>08 million UK Pounds or equivalent rupees</li>
        <li>25 million US Dollars or equivalent rupees</li>
        <li>1.5 billion Rupees</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The memo states that the indemnity bond can either be submitted by Nawaz or his younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
