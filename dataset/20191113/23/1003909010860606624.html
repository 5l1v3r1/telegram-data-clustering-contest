      <h1>'Overwhelming': Veterans food bank swamped with donations after plea</h1>

      <p>A plea for donations to avert a crisis has been answered “amazingly” by the public, say operators of a Calgary veterans’ food bank.</p>
      <p>Last week, those who run the Veterans’ Association Food Bank said their shelves were becoming bare, with <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/need-for-donations-at-critical-point-says-veterans-food-bank">only enough supplies to last into the New Year</a>.</p>
      <p>Demand, they said, had recently skyrocketed among military veteran clients.</p>
      <p>But that request for help resonated with donors who were probably also inspired by Remembrance Day, they said.</p>
      <p>“It’s been absolutely overwhelming, the response we’ve received, we’ve gotten calls from Edmonton,” said Mike Nelson, a military veteran who works at the charity.</p>
      <p>“We were here late last night, we had four pallets of food that flooded our warehouse . . . it’ll see us through for a bit.”</p>
      <p>Nelson said the food bank was receiving the kinds of items most in demand, such as canned fruit, meat and seafood.</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe page purportedly set up to raise money for the cause reached its goal of $10,000 in six days.</p>
      <p>However, food bank founder Marie Blackburn said she hasn’t been in contact with anyone operating a GoFundMe page.</p>
      <p>But she said the days immediately following media coverage of the food bank’s needs brought a huge surge in donations.</p>
      <p>They’ve also taken in a considerable amount of cash, she said, that’s used to keep the charity running and to assist veterans in their homes.</p>
      <p>“We’ve spent a lot of money to prevent homelessness and suicide,” said Blackburn.</p>
      <p>One cash donor, she said, was a 13-year-old who brought in $1,300 from collecting neighbours’ cans and bottles.</p>
      <p>“He said, ‘I’ve got to help the soldiers,’ ” said Blackburn.</p>
      <p>Many of those donating are other veterans, she said, which is consistent with the mandate of the food bank, at 820 28th St. N.E.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Calgary Food Bank said demand for its services is continuing to increase and is up by nearly nine per cent over last year.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the 31st annual Mayor’s Christmas Food Drive kicked off to collect donations for the Calgary Food Bank in a campaign that runs through Dec. 20.</p>
      <p>“We wish we could say that there was no need for a food bank and that there was no hunger in Calgary,” said food bank CEO James McAra.</p>
      <p>“Demand is still at an all-time high and we know first-hand that those accessing us for food support are still reeling from the Alberta downturn.”</p>
