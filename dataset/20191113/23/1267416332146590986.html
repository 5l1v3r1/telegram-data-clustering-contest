      <h1>Apple’s new iPad Pro and iPhone SE 2 are reportedly set to launch in early 2020</h1>
      <h2>The new iPad Pro is tipped to feature 3D sensing technology</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:47:32+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/patrickorourke" target="_blank">Patrick O'Rourke</a></address>
      <p>Hot on the heels of Apple’s recently revealed <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/13/apple-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-scissor-switch-hands-on/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, rumours surrounding the<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/11/05/ipad-pro-2018-review/"> tech giant’s next iPad Pro</a> and entry-level iPhone continue to swirl.</p>
      <p>Often-accurate TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple’s new iPad Pro, which he says will feature 3D sensing technology, will launch in early 2020 alongside the rumoured <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/03/apple-iphone-se-2-rumour-2/">iPhone SE 2</a>.</p>
      <p>As first reported by<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/kuo-ipad-pro-3d-iphone-se-2-first-half-2020/"> <i>MacRumors</i></a>, Kuo goes on to say that the new iPad Pro’s 3D sensing will be powered by a dual rear-facing camera system that includes a time-of-flight sensor. This sensor measures the time it takes light to bounce off objects in a room to create a 3D map of the space.</p>
      <p>This backs up previous rumours reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/11/apple-release-ipad-pro-dual-cameras-2020-report/"><i>Bloomberg’s</i> Mark Gurman</a>, who also stated that Apple plans to release a new iPad Pro with 3D sensing capabilities in early 2020.</p>
      <p>It seems the iPhone SE 2 is also still set to release in early 2020, according to Kuo. The phone is tipped to be similar to the iPhone 8 and will include a 4.7-inch display, Touch ID, Apple’s A13 processor and 3GB of RAM. All of these rumours regarding the iPhone SE 2 fall in line with <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/06/01/iphone-se-2-screen-protector-leak/">previous leaks about the smartphone</a>.</p>
      <p>While Apple could stick with the SE branding for its next entry-level iPhone, given the device seems set to look very different from its predecessor, it’s likely to feature a completely different name.</p>
