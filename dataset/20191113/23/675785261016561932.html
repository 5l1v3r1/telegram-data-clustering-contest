      <h1>Zlatan Ibrahimovic confirms LA Galaxy exit with parting shot at MLS fans</h1>
      <h2>Ibrahimovic told supporters to 'go back to baseball' as former clubs Manchester United and AC Milan are linked with moves for striker in January transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:34:55+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:34</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic has told LA Galaxy fans 'go back to watch baseball' now that he has left the MLS club.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/zlatan-ibrahimovic">Ibrahimovic</a> sent fans a goodbye message thanking them for 'making me feel alive again' - and hinted that there is a new chapter to come in his career.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old has been linked with a return to former club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , who need to sign a striker in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Howver, MLS commissioner Don Graber has claimed Ibrahimovic is already <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/mls-chief-claims-zlatan-ibrahimovich-20836899">on his way to another former club, AC Milan</a> .</p>
      <p>In his parting shot to LA Galaxy fans on Twitter, Ibrahimovic said in his typical humble style: “I came, I saw, I conquered. Thank you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/losangelesgalaxy">LA Galaxy</a> for making me feel alive again.</p>

      <p>"To the Galaxy fans – you wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues … now go back to watch baseball.”</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic joined LA Galaxy after leaving United in March 2018.</p>
      <p>The Swedish striker scored 52 goals in 56 games for the MLS franchise, before his spell with them ended with defeat to Los Angeles FC in the MLS Cup play-offs conference semi-finals.</p>
      <p>He has played for some of the world's biggest clubs, including United, AC Milan, Inter Milan, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and Paris-Saint Germain.</p>
      <p>With the January transfer window looming and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United in need of a striker, speculation has inevitably linked Ibrahimovic with a return to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>However, a move for out-of-favour Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic appears more likely, with the Serie A club's sporting director Fabio Paratici reportedly having flown to the UK for talks with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> chiefs at their London HQ.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, LA Galaxy's president Chris Klein said Ibrahimovic had been a 'positive influence' on football in the city.</p>
      <p>Klein said: “We would like to thank Zlatan for his contributions to the LA Galaxy and Major League Soccer.</p>
      <p>“Since his arrival in 2018, Zlatan has positively influenced the sport of soccer in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>"We are grateful for his work ethic and passion. We thank Zlatan for his professionalism and immeasurable impact on the Los Angeles community and the soccer community in North America as a whole.”</p>
