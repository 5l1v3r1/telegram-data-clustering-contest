      <p>Celine Dion sat down with Gayle King for an interview to air Thursday morning on “CBS This Morning”, and a sneak of the segment was shared on social media on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In the brief video, the Quebec-born chanteuse plays “Lightning Round”, with King serving up rapid-fire questions that Dion must quickly lob back like tennis balls.</p>
      <p>Among the revelations: she’s not much of a TV binge-watcher, but she does enjoy “Young Sheldon”, while she and her kids enjoy films such as “Monsters Inc.” and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang”.</p>

      <p>When King asks Dion to name her favourite meal, things take a bit of a weird turn. At first, she can’t single out any one thing before finally settling on one odd item.</p>
      <p>“I love peanut butter so bad,” she admits, launching into a very fast version of the “Peanut Butter Jelly” song.</p>
      <p>In addition to peanut butter, she also enjoys “baba ghanoush, hummus and Lebanese food,” although hopefully without any added peanut butter.</p>

      <p>Dion also opens up about returning to the road for her first tour in more than a decade, telling King, “Every time you do it, you have to do it like it’s the first time.”</p>
