      <h1>Patrick Wilson Teases King Orm’s Return in Aquaman 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:38:43+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:38</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Last year, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/aquaman"><b>Aquaman</b></a> ended with Arthur Curry triumphing over his half-brother, Orm, to become Atlantis’ new king. Although Atlantean soldiers were escorting him to prison, Arthur offered Orm the chance to talk when he was ready. This exchange strongly implied that Orm will have a role to play in at least one future installment. Now, Patrick Wilson has finally confirmed his involvement in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/aquaman-2"><b>Aquaman 2</b></a>.</p>
      <p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/midway-star-patrick-wilson-his-aquaman-2-future-1254563?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Wilson touched on some of the conversations he’s had with director James Wan about Orm’s appearance in the sequel.</p>
      <p>“I’m slightly briefed,” said Wilson. “Of course, I want to know everything, but I also have a great respect for [Wan] and the process to know that I’m okay staying out of it until it’s late in the game. Sometimes, there’s so much information that I don’t ask because I don’t want to know, and I don’t want him to go, ‘I can’t tell you that yet.’ I just throw a little dart here and there. I’ll say, ‘So, what about this?’ and he’ll say, ‘Well, this is what I’m thinking.’”</p>
      <p>“I can tell you that even his concepts for <b>Aquaman 2</b> are pushing it even further,” continued Wilson. “Whatever that means. I have a few ideas of where Orm fits in, but I’m not gonna talk about them.”</p>

      <p>Naturally, the conversation also turned to HBO’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/watchmen"><b>Watchmen</b></a> series. Wilson obviously has ties to that world, having played Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl II in Zack Snyder’s 2009 <b>Watchmen</b> adaptation.</p>
      <p>“I’m loving it,” said Wilson. “I’ve seen every episode. Of course, I was curious because I had such reverence and love not only for the graphic novel and film, but the experience of making the movie. The friends of mine in that cast are some of the greatest people I’ve worked with. I have such a warm feeling for <b>Watchmen</b>.”</p>
      <p>“So, I was all keyed up to watch it, and then, in one of those trailers, I saw Archie, my ship, as I call it,” added Wilson. “It was not drawn for me, but I take ownership. I thought, ‘Oh my God, who’s flying that thing?’ I just love watching Jean [Smart]. Obviously, I did <b>Fargo</b> with Jean, but another one of my favorite little movies that I did was <b>Barry Munday</b>, and Jean played my mom. I love her, and I thought she was fantastic last week. I can’t wait to watch her and Regina [King] go toe-to-toe. It’s great.”</p>
