      <h1>Massachusetts now offers a nonbinary driver's license option</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:37:54+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:37</time> by <a rel="author">CNN Newsource</a></address>
      <p>Massachusetts residents can now choose a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/06/health/lgbtq-explainer/">nonbinary gender designation</a> on their driver's licenses and ID cards.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the gender designation of "X" -- which signifies gender neutral -- became part of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicle's technology system upgrade, the state Department of Transportation said.</p>
      <p>The registry now recognizes three gender designation options: "male," "female," and "nonbinary," transportation officials said.</p>
      <p>These options are being made available for new credential issuance, renewals and amendments of licenses and IDs, the department said.</p>
      <p>The move comes as the nation celebrates <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/us/transgender-awareness-week-what-you-should-know/index.html">Transgender Awareness Week</a> , which takes place between November 13 and 19. Massachusetts joins <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/health/washington-pennsylvania-gender-x-id/index.html">at least 14 other states</a> that offer a third-gender option on driver's licenses. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/27/health/washington-gender-neutral-drivers-license/index.html">Washington, DC</a> and New York City do, as well.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/06/health/lgbtq-explainer/">Nonbinary is one of the more common terms</a> to describe people who don't identify as male or female. Some may have a gender that blends male and female elements, or they may not identify with any gender. Common synonyms or alternatives to nonbinary terms include genderqueer and gender nonconforming.</p>
