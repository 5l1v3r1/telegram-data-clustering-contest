      <p>To reduce waste, save money on seltzer water, and get creative with homemade bubbly drinks, having the <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-soda-makers-4091721">best SodaStream model</a> for you is a must. Below, I’ve rounded up the four most popular SodaStream models on Amazon. Whatever your preference or budget, there’s a model to meet your needs.</p>
      <p>Each SodaStream featured below requires CO2 cylinders to carbonate beverages, but <a href="https://www.earthsfriends.com/sodastream-comparison/">some also require electricity</a> to function. Models that operate on CO2 cylinders alone use less energy, if cutting back on energy use is important to you. One of these picks operates on electricity, while two only need CO2 cylinders. The electric models have preset carbonation settings for easy, more automatic, custom fizz where the non-electric models require more active awareness of your bottle's fizz level.</p>
      <p>Whichever you choose, you’ll still need to refill your cylinders, and SodaStream doesn’t recommend doing that anywhere other than an authorized <a href="https://support.sodastream.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009091234-Can-I-refill-my-own-carbonating-cylinder-or-have-it-refilled-locally-">SodaStream refilling station</a>. You can also <a href="https://support.sodastream.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009091214-What-do-I-do-when-my-carbonating-cylinder-runs-out-of-CO2-">exchange used cylinders</a> for new ones via the mail or in a SodaStream store. If you decide you no longer need a SodaStream, you can <a href="https://support.sodastream.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021075934-I-no-longer-want-my-SodaStream-cylinder-What-should-I-do-with-it-">return your cylinders</a> to a SodaStream store for recycling.</p>
      <p>Each SodaStream model below includes at least one CO2 cylinder that can make up to 60 liter<b> </b>of sparkling beverages before replenishing. The units below all offer varied fizz levels, for custom carbonation and include either BPA-free plastic carbonator bottles, or, in the case of the last set, glass carbonating carafes.</p>
      <p>Although you'll still find them online, the SodaStream Genesis, Power, and Source models have all been discontinued, so I’ve left them off this list; so, take a look at the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/if-you-have-a-sodastream-you-need-to-know-about-this-major-recall-39851">best SodaStream models</a> available on Amazon.</p>
