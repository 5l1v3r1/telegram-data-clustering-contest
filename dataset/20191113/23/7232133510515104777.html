      <h1>Ethereum Nears End of Consolidation Period as Big Move Looms on Horizon</h1>

      <p>Ethereum (ETH) has been trapped beneath its near-term resistance level at $190 for over a month and has shown few clear signs of gaining any notable momentum that will allow it to decisively propel past this level.</p>
      <p>Analysts are now noting, however, that Ethereum may be nearing the apex of a bullish flag formation that could send its pricing surging higher in the near-term, meaning that it may soon decisively break above its long-held resistance level at $190 and target a movement up towards $200.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Continues Consolidating Below $190 </h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/29/ethereum-may-target-160-despite-heightened-network-activity/">Ethereum</a> is trading up just over 1% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">current price</a> of $188.30, and it has been inching higher over the past couple of days as it slowly approaches its key near-term resistance level at $190.</p>
      <p>Over the past month, ETH has been ranging between lows of $160 and highs of $190, with each visit to the lower range boundary being met with strong buying pressure and each visit to $190 being met with significant selling pressure that tends to push its price down towards $180.</p>
      <p>The formation of this relatively wide trading range has come about concurrently with a period of sideways trading for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/11/bullish-cross-on-daily-macd-points-to-12k-bitcoin-in-november/">Bitcoin</a>, which was previously caught within a tight trading range between $9,000 and $9,500 before it broke below this range and found strong support at $8,700.</p>
      <h3>ETH May Soon Incur Bullish Momentum</h3>
      <p>In the near-term, it appears that Ethereum’s price action is only loosely correlated with that of Bitcoin, as analysts are noting that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/04/analyst-ethereum-price-likely-to-stagnate-until-bitcoin-gets-moving/">ETH</a> may soon break above its near-term resistance level and surge towards $200.</p>
      <p>CryptoGainz, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, referencing ETH’s recent break above the upper boundary of its previously established descending triangle, while also referencing the fact that it is currently trading within a bullish pennant.</p>
      <blockquote>“$ETH wants to break out,” he concisely noted.</blockquote>

      <p>Jonny Moe, another popular crypto analyst, shared a similar observation in a recent tweet, explaining that he believes Ethereum is nearing the end of its consolidation phase.</p>
      <blockquote>“Watching $ETH for possible end of consolidation soon,” he said while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <p>The coming day may elucidate the long-term significance of the bullish chart patterns currently expressed by Ethereum, as any bullish momentum may send the crypto flying towards the $200 region.</p>
