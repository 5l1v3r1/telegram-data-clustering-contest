      <p>MELBOURNE, Nov 14 — BHP Group Ltd named Mike Henry to replace Andrew Mackenzie as the world’s biggest miner’s new chief executive officer next year.</p>
      <p>Mackenzie will retire on December 31, ending nearly seven years in charge of the global miner, and over a decade with the company.</p>
      <p>Henry, BHP’s current president of operations minerals in Australia, will take over from January 1, the miner said.</p>
      <p>Under Mackenzie’s tenure, BHP has grappled with investor pressure to consider drastic changes in management to tackle challenges like cutting costs, a return to lower iron ore prices, and reputational damage after a Brazil dam disaster.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Reuters reported that some institutional investors in Australia were pushing BHP to consider external candidates to replace Mackenzie as CEO.</p>
      <p>“Fresh leadership will deliver an acceleration in the enormous potential for value and returns that will come from BHP’s next wave of transformation,” Mackenzie said in a statement.</p>
      <p>His replacement, Henry, has been with BHP since 2003, and has spent 30 years in the industry. He takes over at a time where global economic risks, such as softer demand and volatile prices, could hurt future results of the dual-listed miner.</p>
      <p>“I think (investors) will be quite comfortable with his broad experience across the whole company,” said Fat Prophets analyst David Lennox.</p>
      <p>His experience should “enable him to steer BHP through the next five to six years that are going to be extremely challenging for big miners,” Lennox added.</p>
      <p>“We will unlock even greater value from our ore bodies and petroleum basins,” CEO-elect Henry said, adding that BHP must operate safely and reduce its impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>Shareholders are intensifying pressure on companies, especially in the resources sector, to show urgency in combating climate change, given the impact of their core operations on the environment.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, Henry will earn a base salary of US$1.7 million (RM7 million) a year.</p>
      <p>“Mike Henry’s deep operational and commercial experience, developed in a global career spanning the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia, is the perfect mix for our next CEO,” said BHP’s Chairman Ken MacKenzie. — Reuters</p>
