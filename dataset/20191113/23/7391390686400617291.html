      <p>The days are getting shorter, colder, and calling for significantly more caffeine. If you’re hoping to get your hands on a hot beverage ASAP and wondering <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/starbucks-happy-hour-november-2019-bogo-handcrafted-drinks">when the next Starbucks Happy Hour is</a>, you won’t have to wait very long. On Thursday, Nov. 14 — as in tomorrow — Starbucks is running their Happy Hour deal from 2 p.m. until 7 p.m. Given the popularity of the Happy Hour promotions, you might want to get in line now.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow afternoon/early evening, customers can take part in <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/when-is-starbucks-happy-hour-in-2018-you-can-get-even-more-drinks-half-off-this-time-around-8613968">Starbucks’ Happy Hour BOGO deal</a>, getting one free handcrafted beverage with the purchase of any handcrafted beverage in a grande size or larger. This deal includes the recently announced <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/starbucks-holiday-drinks-for-2019-include-5-massive-fan-favorites-19297408">Starbucks holiday beverages</a> if you feel like getting festive, though the beloved <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/heres-what-to-order-at-starbucks-if-youre-sad-theres-no-gingerbread-latte-this-year-19302892">Gingerbread Latte</a> isn't included since it's no longer on the menu. Even if you miss the drink, you'll still be happy to know that Starbucks is bringing back five other fan-favorite drinks for the 2019 holiday season. As part of tomorrow’s promotion, you can enjoy a Peppermint Mocha, Eggnog Latte, Caramel Brulee Latte, Chestnut Praline Latte, or Toasted White Chocolate Mocha ... and then get a second one completely free.</p>
      <p>If you don’t feel like partaking in the seasonal festivities just yet, bah humbug and that’s fine, I guess. As Starbucks points out on its website, the <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/promo/happyhour">BOGO happy hour deal</a> includes <i>any</i> handcrafted drink. That includes everything from iced coffees to cold brews to macchiatos to matcha to Pink Drinks to Frappuccinos. It even includes <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/starbucks-nitro-cold-brew-doesnt-come-in-a-venti-heres-why-18746757">Starbucks Nitro drinks</a> if they're available at your location. To each their own BOGO deal.</p>
