      <p>Cody Fajardo feels that he’s walking a fine line when it comes to dealing with an oblique muscle injury.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-to-face-winnipeg-blue-bombers-in-west-division-final">The Saskatchewan Roughriders’ franchise quarterback knows that he has to prepare for Sunday’s West Division final against the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</a>
      </p>
      <p>He’s balancing that against suffering a setback while recovering from an oblique injury that he suffered during a practice on Oct. 30 and sidelined for the Riders” regular-season finale against the Edmonton Eskimos.</p>
      <p>“You have to progress each day,” Fajardo said after Wednesday’s practice at the AffinityPlex.</p>
      <p>“My plan has been the whole time is to come out on Day 1, throw 10 to 15 yards and progress as the week goes on and continue to throw further and further. I just don’t want to exhaust it. Even if I feel good, I don’t want to throw 100 or 200 balls because that wouldn’t make any sense.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo is expected to attempt longer passes and test how the injury has recovered during Thursday’s closed practice.</p>
      <p>“I’m anxious and excited to see how I feel after throwing (Wednesday),” Fajardo said. “Obviously I will wake up a little sore, but as the day progresses, I will get it loosened up and get it ready to go.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo practised with the first-team offence on Wednesday and attempted a number of short passes. He also spent a portion of the practice throwing approximately 15 balls to Shaq Evans.</p>
      <p>“To see (Fajardo) moving around, running and handling the huddle and getting guys in and out was encouraging,” said Riders head coach Craig Dickenson. “He’s making progress each day and I’m encouraged by what I see. (Thursday) is a more important day because we’ll go a little longer and put in more offence. (Thursday) will be a big day to see him out there.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo reiterated that he would do whatever takes to play on Sunday, but not at the expense of the team.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t want to do something dumb,” Fajardo said. “I don’t want to throw a ball deep and then have something else happen. It could be another muscle because everything down there is just clinching up. I don’t think it’s smart to push it when I don’t have to.”</p>
      <p>Dickenson said that Fajardo would dress regardless of his status on Sunday. Isaac Harker, who led the Riders to a 23-13 win over the Edmonton Eskimos that clinched first place in the West Division for the Green and White, would start if Fajardo isn’t able to go.</p>
