      <h1>Shenmue 3's launch trailer is equal parts wistful and grandiose</h1>

      <p>After years of breathless anticipation, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/shenmue-3-everything-we-know/">Shenmue 3</a> finally launches on November 19. Above is the launch trailer, and it seems pretty on-brand: there's thoughtful black and white passages, some very urgent dialogue, a few instances of fisticuffs and a red clad woman with a very menacing laugh.</p>
      <p>"Journey deep into rural China as you take on the role of Ryo Hazuki, a Japanese teenager hellbent on finding his father’s killer—a story of adventure, mystery, friendship, martial arts, and ultimately, revenge," reads the YouTube description. I haven't played a Shenmue game, but I'm definitely keen to see what the fuss is about.</p>
      <p>Of course, Shenmue 3 is now a timed Epic Games Store exclusive, which rustled feathers to the extent that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/shenmue-3-backers-will-have-2-weeks-to-get-a-refund/">refunds were offered</a> to Kickstarter backers. If that controversy is no concern to you the outlet is positive: Samuel Roberts wrote back in July that it feels like a game from 20 years ago, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/shenmue-3-feels-like-a-game-from-20-years-ago-and-i-mean-that-in-a-good-way/">he means that in a good way</a>.</p>
