      <h1>Bishop chosen to investigate church sex abuse is himself accused</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:26:17+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p>A bishop tapped by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a> to investigate the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Church's response to sex abuse allegations in Buffalo, N.Y., has himself been accused of sexually abusing a child decades ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/massachusetts">Boston</a> attorney Mitchell Garabedian notified the church officials in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> this week of the allegations against Brooklyn Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio. The bishop was selected by Francis last month to investigate the church's Buffalo Diocese, where <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-president-buffalo-bishop-should-resign">Bishop Joseph Malone</a> has come under fire for his handling of a clergy abuse scandal.</p>
      <p>Garabedian said he is preparing a lawsuit on behalf of his client, Mark Matzek, 56, who said DiMarzio molested him in the mid-1970s as a priest in Jersey City, N.J. The lawsuit will ask for $20 million in compensation.</p>

      <p>Maria Margiotta, the spokeswoman for the Newark Archdiocese, told Fox News that it received Garabedian's letter and had sent a report of the allegations to law enforcement. The Archdiocese of Brooklyn did not respond to messages from Fox News on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>DiMarzio told The Associated Press there is no truth to the claims.</p>
      <p>“I am just learning about this allegation,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “In my nearly 50-year ministry as a priest, I have never engaged in unlawful or inappropriate behavior, and I emphatically deny this allegation. I am confident I will be fully vindicated.”</p>
      <p>Matzek said he was repeatedly abused by DiMarzio and another priest, the late Rev. Albert Mark, when he was an altar boy at St. Nicholas Church and a student at St. Nicholas School.</p>
      <p>In a statement to AP, Garabedian said any investigation led by DiMarzio is tainted because of the accusations against him.</p>
      <p>"There needs to be a truly neutral investigator to determine whether Bishop Malone should resign,” he said.</p>

      <p>He said the investigating should be led by a law enforcement agency.</p>
      <p>Adriana Rodriguez, press secretary for the Brooklyn Diocese, told  AP that DiMarzio had submitted his report on the Buffalo Diocese to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion/vatican">Vatican</a>. DiMarzio and Malone are in Rome this week for a previously scheduled visit of New York bishops to the Holy See.</p>
      <p>DiMarzio said he interviewed 80 clergymen and parishioners over three trips to the Buffalo Diocese over seven days.</p>
