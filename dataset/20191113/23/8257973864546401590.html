      <p>The 30-second spot shows Weber emerging from a stone castle with a windmill, a nod to a much talked about date he had with Hannah Brown on her season of <i>The Bachelorette. </i>Weber is dressed in a black suit holding the show's signature rose. He sniffs the rose buy says nothing.</p>
      <p>Weber was a fan favorite to win <i>The Bachelorette</i> and marry Brown, but she did not give him the final rose.</p>
      <p>Season 24 will premiere with a group date, according to an ABC press release.</p>
      <p>ABC also promised a surprise visitor on the season premiere.</p>
      <p><i>The Bachelor</i> premiered in 2002 with Bachelor Alex Michel, its spinoff <i>The Bachelorette</i> in 2003 with <i>Bachelor</i> contestant Trista Rehn as the Bachelorette. Previous Bachelors include Andrew Firestone, Charlie O'Connell and two time Bachelor Brad Womack.</p>
