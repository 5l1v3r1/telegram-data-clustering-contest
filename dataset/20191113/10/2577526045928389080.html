      <h1>Teenage Fortnite Pro Suspended From Twitch For Streaming With Banned Player</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:00:14+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>Fortnite pro Cody ‘Clix’ Conrod has received a seven-day suspension from Twitch after he streamed on Monday alongside Zayn, a player who has been permanently banned from the service.</p>
      <p>It’s the second time this month a player has been punished for even associating with Zayn, after another <i>Fortnite </i>pro, Khanada, got a three-day suspension last week.</p>

      <p>Zayn has been banned because, after himself being suspended for a different offence, he was caught creating a second account from which he just kept on streaming.</p>
      <p>Clix and Khanada’s suspensions, meanwhile, are because it’s against Twitch’s rules to have a banned streamer anywhere near your own broadcast, so their similar excuses – that he was muted – weren’t good enough for Twitch.</p>
      <p>It’s been a rough month for Conrod; <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/10/28/teenage-fortnite-pro-swatted-live-on-stream">a few weeks back his home was swatted while he was in the middle of a stream</a>.</p>
