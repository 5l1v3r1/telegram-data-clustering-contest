      <p>SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s government said on Wednesday it had congratulated Senator Jeanine Anez for “constitutionally” taking over the presidency of neighbouring Bolivia.</p>
      <p>“Brazil greets her determination to work towards the pacification of the country and the prompt execution of general elections,” Brazil’s foreign ministry added on its Twitter account.</p>
      <p>Anez declared herself interim president of the South American country in Congress on Tuesday despite a lack of a quorum to appoint her in a legislative session boycotted by lawmakers from former president Evo Morales’ leftist party.</p>
