      <p>Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan says Barcelona star Lionel Messi is the greatest player of all time.</p>
      <p>Despite the debate, which has now existed for a decade, about whether Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo is the best, the German international made his opinion quite clear.</p>
      <p>"Lionel Messi [is the best player in the world]," he said. "In my opinion, he has very special abilities. He has talent and he always manages to show it on the pitch. He always has the instinct to make the right decision.</p>
      <p>"He uses his speed well against the opponents he plays. He has a strong finish. All in all, no one else has as much quality as Lionel Messi. He is the star player of my generation and the greatest footballer of all time. I hope we get to watch him play for a few more years."</p>
      <p>Messi has scored nine goals in 11 appearances this season. He scored a hat-trick against Celta Vigo last weekend, with two of the goals coming from free-kicks. For the last 11 years, he has scored at least 40 goals in each calendar year. Even when Bar√ßa aren't on form, he is.</p>
