      <p>Irish politician Michael Healy-Rae has now spoken of one particular incident that took place in a pub in the southern county.</p>
      <p>Talking on the <i>Pat Kenny Show</i>, Healy-Rae remembered how Cruise was branded a “bastard” and falsely accused of stealing cigarettes while drinking at the Loo Bridge Bar near the town of Kilgarvan.</p>

      <p>“This day, this young boy and young girl came into the pub and had jeans and sunglasses and tanned faces on them,” Healy-Rae revealed.</p>
      <p>“There was a man sitting down the end of the counter called Ger The Manny. Everyone has a nickname and his name was Ger The Manny. He was an elderly man and he had his stick up on the counter and he was sipping away at a little glass of Guinness.”</p>
      <p>Wanting more ice for his Diet Coke, Cruise then reportedly leaned over the bar to dip his hand in the ice bucket and get more ice for his drink.</p>

      <p>“Ger jumped up off his stool, he caught his stick and drew a belt at yer man’s hand trying to hit him across the hand,” he continued. “But he just missed and there was a big bang down on the counter right near the Yank’s hand.”</p>
      <p>“The Yank said, ‘My goodness I was just leaning in to get a bit more ice’.”</p>
      <p>“Ger The Manny shouted out, ‘You bastard you were trying to steal [barman] Matt’s fags’.”</p>
      <p>Healy-Rae added: “If Ger had been an inch or two longer he could have broke the arm of Tom Cruise trying to accuse him wrongly of trying steal a cigarette.”</p>
