        <b>Tigresses edged past Cheetahs by a scoreline of 2-1 in the second match of the 4-team U-17 Women's Championship at the Kalyani Municipal Stadium on Monday. Amisha Baxla and Karen Estrocio scored the goal in the first six minutes while Reet Kashyap scored in the 66th minute for Tigress.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tigress' young girls scored two goals in the early minutes of the match to secure a narrow victory over Bembem Devi coached Cheetahs' in the second match of the U-17 Women's Championship. The 4-team youth championship is developed to create a national women's squad for the upcoming U-17 FIFA Women's World-Cup in India next year.</p>
      <p>Kalyani Municipal Stadium, on Monday, saw a thrilling match between two young sides. Tigress scored two goals in six minutes in the first half while Indian women legend Bembem Devi-coached Cheetahs fought hard to score in the second half but could only score once in the 66th minute.</p>
      <p>Tigress's Amisha Baxla in the third minute placed a beautiful shot past the Cheetahs' custodian Anshika Anshika. Amisha did not stop there, as the young girl assisted Karen Estrocio for a second goal three minutes later.</p>
      <p>The Cheetahs fought hard for the return goal but Tigresses’ skipper Martina Thokchom’s ability in the midfield hindered any Cheetahs movements. The Cheetahs, however, started coming back into the contest as the game progressed, moreover they created a few half-chances of their own.</p>
      <p>In the second half, Bembem Devi's Cheetahs displayed better football and their young girls, Reet and Saraswati Kumari put on robust displays. The effort paid off in the 66th minute as Reet Kashyap scored the return goal. After the return goal Cheetah's pressed hard, however, the young tigress girls defended hard for the full points. </p>
