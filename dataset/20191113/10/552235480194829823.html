      <p>An Irvine teacher has just released his latest book detailing Irvine’s past.</p>
      <p>Dane Love’s latest book ‘A Look Back at Irvine’ is a pictorial reflection of old Irvine with 40 old photographs, each complete with detailed historical captions.</p>
      <p>Dane, an Irvine Royal Academy teacher, said: “Many of the pictures have not appeared in print before and will be of interest to residents of the ancient burgh or exiles far afield.”</p>
      <p>This is the author’s 34th book and reflects his interest in all things Ayrshire.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “I taught at Irvine Royal for 27 years, over which time I’ve enjoyed discovering more about the history of the town.</p>
      <p>“I enjoy finding out the wee stories that don’t always find their way into everyday history books, bringing them back to the attention of current townsfolk.</p>
      <p>“This book is no exception and some historical characters from Irvine’s past have been unearthed once more.”</p>

      <p>The reader will find out more about many of the older shops in the streets that have changed over the years and, in Irvine’s case, have been obliterated completely.</p>
      <p>There are accounts of many individuals, events and buildings and the author hopes that the book will make Irvine folk start digging more into their local history.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “Here one can read about the well incident in Cochrane Street, the town’s hymn-writers, the ropeworks, the Queen’s visit, the Covenanters, Mary Queen of Scots, and much more.”</p>
      <p>‘A Look Back at Irvine’ is published by Carn Publishing and can be purchased at Kaleidoscope Gifts or Small Talk Gifts.</p>
      <p>It is also available from www.carnpublishing.com.</p>
