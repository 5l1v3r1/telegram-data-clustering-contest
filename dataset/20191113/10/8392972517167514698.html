      <p>Ellen Taylor, one of the top writers on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> has revealed she is confident the show will go to SEVEN episodes a week.</p>
      <p>The soap added an extra episode in 2017 under the leadership of then-boss Kate Oates, but now it's been suggested yet another weekly visit to Weatherfield is on the cards.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://conversationstreet.podbean.com/">Conversation Street podcast</a> Ellen explained the move to six episodes has already presented "challenges".</p>

      <p>She said: "There are a lot of challenges in terms of production obviously, you need more cast and you need a bigger set.</p>
      <p>"Also, it throws up challenges, for me, in terms of stories, and not always good ones if I'm honest.</p>
      <aside>Emmerdale are already at seven episodes so you know it's going to happen at some point.</aside>
      <p>"That's because when you have six episodes, particularly with our transmission pattern, it's like you have to ramp up the story very quickly.</p>
      <p>"I think it makes the story telling more heightened - you've got to have more big dramatic moments because you've got to keep hooking the viewers in and I'm not sure that's always a good thing.</p>

      <p>"I still think Corrie maintains a balance very well but I think because of those six episodes a week, those high octane storylines and hooks to keep the viewers, there have become a more dominant feature of the process."</p>
      <p>She then added it wasn't likely to calm down any time soon either!</p>
      <p>"Increased volume isn't always a good thing. It's a lot more work for everyone.</p>
      <p>"It's great for more Corrie, but is it best in the long run? I don't know.</p>
      <p>"We're never going to go back down. Emmerdale are already at seven episodes so you know it's going to happen at some point."</p>
