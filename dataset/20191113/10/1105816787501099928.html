      <p><b>JERUSALEM: </b>Scores of Jewish settlers forced their way into Jerusalem’s flashpoint Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on Wednesday, according to a Palestinian agency.</p>
      <p>“Around 123 settlers backed by Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa compound since early morning,” said the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, a Jordan-run agency responsible for overseeing the city’s Muslim and Christian holy sites.</p>
      <p>Settlers swarmed into the site via the Al-Maghariba Gate, usually guarded by Israeli police.</p>

      <p>Earlier on Wednesday, at least two Palestinians were martyred in an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>The situation escalated in Gaza early Tuesday after an Israeli airstrike killed Bahaa Abu al-Atta, the commander of the Islamic Jihad resistance group. His wife Asmaa Abu al-Atta was also killed.</p>
      <p>For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents the world’s third-holiest site. Jews, for their part, refer to the area as the “Temple Mount,” claiming it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times.</p>
      <p>Israel occupied East Jerusalem – in which Al-Aqsa is located – during the 1967 Middle East War. It formally annexed the entire city in 1980, claiming it as its capital – a move never recognised by the international community.</p>
