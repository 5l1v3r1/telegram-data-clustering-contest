      <p>VICTORIA — The variable speed-limit system on British Columbia's highways is expanding to a stretch of Highway 3 just east of Hope at the base of the Cascade Mountains.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Ministry of Transportation says four new variable speed signs along seven kilometres of the highway will regulate traffic through the potentially tricky stretch.</p>
      <p>Transportation Minister Claire Trevena says weather can change rapidly in the climb from the Fraser Valley toward the mountains and the upgraded signage will quickly reflect those conditions.</p>
      <p>The variable speed limit system uses data from road surface sensors and traffic sensors to recommend lower speeds during adverse conditions, and a maximum allowable speed is posted on illuminated signs along the route.</p>
      <p>The $25-million Highway 3 project also includes installation of a new congestion-based speed limit system on Highway 1 between Abbotsford and Chilliwack, but that system is still being tested and isn't expected to begin operating until early next year.</p>
      <p>British Columbia has used variable speed sensors and reader boards along three other challenging highway corridors since 2016.</p>
      <p>Those routes include Highway 1 between Revelstoke and Sicamous, the Coquihalla Highway between Highway 3 and Merritt and the Sea-to-Sky Highway between Squamish and Whistler.</p>
