      <p>Mumbai-based <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/startup">startup </a>Coolberg, which makes malt-based flavoured non-alcoholic beers, has secured $3.5 million in Series-A round led by RB Investments (a Singapore-based family office) and existing investor India Quotient. The round also saw participation from Ashish Goenka, chairman of Suashish Diamonds Ltd, and a pool of investors from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-angel-network">Indian Angel Network.</a></p>
      <p>Coolberg operates in the premium soft beverages category. "There is significant overlap between beer drinkers and soft drink consumers, and there are many who do not consume <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alcohol">alcohol </a>due to religious and cultural beliefs. In some of the developed countries, non-alcoholic beers are considered healthier drinks as well," the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Besides traditional trade channels like supermarkets and restaurants, Coolberg is available across 12,000 outlets. It is also available at offices, colleges and airports. "Basically anywhere you find a Cola, we want you to be able to find a Coolberg as well," said Pankaj Aswani, founder of Coolberg Beverages. “Raising this investment will help us strengthen our distribution network and increase brand awareness” Aswani added.</p>
      <p>“The Indian beverage market is witnessing an interesting transformation with an increased demand for new flavours. All our variants are unique, refreshing and new to market. Our R&amp;D team is strong and keeps a close eye on consumer needs,” said Yashika Keswani, co-founder and chief operating officer.</p>
      <p>Madhukar Sinha, a partner at India Quotient, said: “IQ is excited to lead the Series-A round at Coolberg. We are very happy with the growth in revenue as well as the buzz around the brand in the served cities.”</p>
      <p>Coolberg was conceptualised by Pankaj Aswani and Yashika Keswani to provide innovative products to enjoy during celebrations, hangouts, casual meetings, etc. The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/startup">startup </a>had earlier raised an undisclosed seed amount from venture capital firm India Quotient and Indian Angel Network’s (IAN’s) maiden fund.</p>
