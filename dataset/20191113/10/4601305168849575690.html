      <h1>Threatin, "fake" singer-songwriter you haven't thought about in about a year, now on tour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:30:02+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/12/17/profiles-of-threatin-singer-w.html">Last November</a>, Jered "Threatin" Eames hired some musicians, booked venues on the strength of inauthentic social media profiles, then played to empty halls and angry proprietors who soon outed the hustle. His viral fame was short lived, but now he's back—for real, this time, at least for certain values of reality—playing to paying customers. Vice <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/fake-band-threatin-return-london-camden-review-2563926">sent a critic to a UK gig</a>: "It was as weird as you could imagine," writes Hannah Mylrea.</p>
      <blockquote>Jered is clearly an accomplished guitarist (his vocals, less so) and his band for the evening are slick, but due to the complete lack of crowd interaction and Jered’s wannabe rockstar swagger, it makes for an uncomfortable watch, even without all the ridiculous pre-cursors. Clearly too uncomfortable for some, as the crowd noticeably thins out throughout.<br/><br/>After 45-minutes Jered finishes the show by smashing up the stage – ripping down his banners and decapitating the mannequins – and then giving a mock bow before walking off stage. That’s the last the crowd and I see of him.</blockquote>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Threatin.</p>
