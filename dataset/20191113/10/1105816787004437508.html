      <p>In a recent throwback picture, Dua Lipa posed in a desi outfit, standing inside what appears to be a temple in India. The Hollywood diva who rose to fame with her song <i>New Rules  </i>will be performing in Mumbai on November 16 at a musical festival, along with Katy Perry. Meanwhile, Perry has landed in the city but Lipa is yet to come, according to <i>Times of India</i>.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood diva shared her excitement of visiting the country for the second time on her Instagram, as she uploaded a series of pictures from her last trip to India and expressed the joy of sharing the stage with the <i>Fireworks </i>singer.</p>

      <p>“So excited to go back to India this week! I’ve never had the chance to perform in front of you and I’m excited to share the stage with katy Perry!” she captioned the pictures.</p>
      <p>In the main picture, however, the singer could be seen draped a light blue sari with golden embellishments, as she posed for a picture with the <i>choli </i>covering her head.</p>
      <p>The <i>Blow Your Mind </i>singer blew her fans away with her look after sharing the throwback, making one recall the amount of times Hollywood artists have donned desi outfits and rocked the look.</p>
      <p>The picture was taken in a temple in Jaipur, while the following pictures Lipa shared were of the traffic and herself at the beach.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old singer who visited India last year in October with her boyfriend Isaac Crew had explored several places. Lipa documented her a week-long vacation with an Instagram post where she shared pictures of her along with her boyfriend sharing an intimate moment.</p>
      <p>In that post, she revealed that their visit “getting totally immersed in the magical culture, food and traditions. A trip we’ve wanted to do for a very long time and I’m so happy we did! All those 5 am yoga sessions have me up and ready to get back to work again. I’ve braved it and taken pretty much all our pictures on film so I could stay away from my phone and I’ve just taken them to get developed,” she added.</p>
