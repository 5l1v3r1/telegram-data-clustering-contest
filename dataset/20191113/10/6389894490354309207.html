      <p>Low cost flyer Wizz Air is planning to spread its wings in its key London market, “no matter what happens … to Brexit,” its chief executive said today.</p>
      <p>Jozsef Varadi, who co-founded the Hungarian carrier, said this morning he “absolutely” plans to expand in the capital, despite missing out on Thomas Cook’s take-off and landing slots at Gatwick in the wake of its collapse.</p>
      <p>The firm announced profits rose more than a quarter in the first half of its financial year, with more passengers than ever before travelling on its flights.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p><b>Net profit was €371.5m</b> for the six months to 30 September, a 26.2 per cent year-on-year rise. </p>
      <p><b>Revenue </b>rose 21.7 per cent to <b>€1.67bn</b>.</p>
      <p>Wizz Air carried <b>22.1m passengers</b> in the first half, up 17.9 per cent.</p>
      <p><b>Load factor</b> – a measure of how full its planes were – was up one percentage point to <b>94.6 per cent</b>.</p>
      <p>Total cash at the end of September was €1.82bn, of which <b>€1.63bn was free cash</b>.</p>
      <h3>Why it’s interesting</h3>
      <p>Varadi told Bloomberg this morning the figures represented “a pretty upbeat performance”. </p>
      <p>He said he expects profit growth to accelerate by more than 20 per cent during the winter after the strong performance.</p>
      <p>This was despite “genuine macro-economic challenges” facing the European low-cost aviation sector. Despite the strong performance, the statement was enough to push shares down two per cent this morning.</p>
      <p>Varadi said Wizz Air’s operating costs had stayed flat while other low cost airlines had seen them increase. </p>
      <p>This would be helped further by moving to a larger Airbus A321 Neo aircraft, which carries 239 people, rather than the low-cost industry standard of roughly 160 people on a flight.</p>
      <h3>What Wizz Air said</h3>
      <p>Varadi added that he remained “bullish” about the London market.</p>
      <p>“London is the single biggest travel market in the world, and I don’t think this is going to change any time soon, no matter what happens to the country, what happens throughout Brexit.</p>
      <p>“We are very keen on positioning ourselves strategically to the London market.”</p>
