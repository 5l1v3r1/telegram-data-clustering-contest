      <h3>‘BASTA ba didilaan nila eh’’</h3>
      <p>This was the condition given by an irate Manila Mayor Isko Moreno when asked for his reaction to the statement made by a leftist group that its members are ‘willing to talk ...(to the mayor) to discuss the matter.’  Said group claimed responsibility for having spray-painted the newly-painted City Hall underpass with anti-government slogans.</p>
      <p>As this developed, Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna, who is also the presiding officer of the Manila City Council that passes local laws or ordinances, said that the said group flagrantly violated Ordinance 7971 which prohibits the defacing of any public property.</p>
      <p>Lacuna stressed that violation of the said ordinance carries a fine of from P1,000 to P5,000 or imprisonment of from six months to one year or both, depending on the court’s discretion.</p>
      <p>She said the members of the city council are discussing what actions to take on the matter.</p>
      <p>Moreno meanwhile appeared not inclined to cave in to the idea being broached by the group of vandals that they should meet, saying he has more important things to attend to.</p>
      <p>‘Naghahanap kayo ng matinong gobyerno tapos ‘yung nagsusumikap na magkaroon ng kaayusan, kayo ang manggugulo,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘The people of Manila don’t deserve this...human rights? ‘Wag kayo papahuli sa akin. Pag nahuli ko  kayo,  ipapadila ko sa inyo, buburahin nyo ito ng dila nyo,’ Moreno added.</p>
