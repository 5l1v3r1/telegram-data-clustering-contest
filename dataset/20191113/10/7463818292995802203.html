      <p>The Samsung Galaxy A series has replaced the Galaxy J line. That is the reason why you no longer see any new Galaxy J phones—just Galaxy M or Galaxy A models. The Galaxy A line has survived through the years and we know the South Korean tech giant has all the intention to keep it. The last Galaxy A device we mentioned here was the Samsung Galaxy A70s said to come with a 64MP camera. The model did arrive in India.</p>
      <p>There is no mention if the phone will ever be ready in the United States. As for the next Galaxy A phone, we are looking at the Galaxy A51 which is an obvious follow-up to the <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-a50/">Galaxy A50</a> from earlier this year. The <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/samsung-galaxy-a30-galaxy-a50-announced-as-major-mid-range-upgrades-20190226/">mid-range phone</a> arrived with the Galaxy A30.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy A50 <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/samsung-galaxy-a50-hits-dxomark-with-decent-photo-video-scores-20190705/">hit DxOMark with decent Photo and Video Scores</a> and <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/samsung-galaxy-a50-durability-test-watch-if-the-device-survives-20190805/">survived a Durability Test</a>. As for the Samsung Galaxy A51, there is no official announcement yet but the <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-a51-renders-images-punch-hole-display-quad-cameras-exclusive">image renders</a> by OnLeaks and PriceBaba give us an idea.</p>
      <p>The upcoming mid-ranger may be released early in 2020. It may be more similar to the Galaxy A50s in design. The phone appears to have a flat display with a punch-hole where the 32MP selfie camera is situated. It may remind you of the Galaxy Note 10 series.</p>

      <p>Specs and features include a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screen, 158.4 x 73.7 x 7.9mm dimensions, four rear cameras arranged in L-shape with LED flash, curved edge back panel, and probably an on-screen scanner. There is still a loudspeaker grill, 3.5mm audio jack, and a USB Type-C port on the bottom edge. We can also expect a 4000mAh battery, One UI 2.0, and Android 10. The rear camera system may include a 48MP primary cam, 12MP wide-angle, 12MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom, and a 5MP depth sensor.</p>
