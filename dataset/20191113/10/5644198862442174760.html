      <p>Asian stocks and Wall Street futures fell on Wednesday, as growing worries that U.S.-China trade talks are stalling and concern about intensifying unrest in Hong Kong hurt demand for risky assets.</p>
      <p>TOKYO: Asian stocks and Wall Street futures fell on Wednesday, as confusing signals over the extent of progress made in U.S.-China trade talks and concern about intensifying unrest in Hong Kong hurt demand for risky assets.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.03per cent to the lowest in more than a week. Hong Kong shares slumped 2per cent to a four-week low, battered by fears that anti-government protests appear to be spiraling out of control.</p>

      <p>The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.57per cent, German DAX futures were off 0.58per cent, and FTSE futures fell 0.54per cent.</p>
      <p>The dollar drifted in Asia after U.S. President Donald Trump said a trade deal was "close" but gave no new details on when or where an agreement would be signed, disappointing investors in what was billed as a major speech on his administration's economic policies.</p>
      <p>Trump also rattled some investors by threatening China with even more tariffs if they do not sign a deal.</p>
      <p>Oil prices fell as diminishing prospects for an immediate resolution to a 16-month long trade war between the world's two-largest economies suggested less demand for energy in the future.</p>
      <p>Expectations for a "phase one" trade deal some time this month have been a key factor supporting stocks and riskier assets recently. However, the lack of material progress on an agreement has only increased doubts about whether a trade deal will take place at all.</p>
      <p>"I'm absolutely concerned. The clock is ticking," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.</p>
      <p>"Markets are now expecting substantial progress in the next week or so, and if not, then confidence could crumble. There are diverging interpretations of Trump's comments. I tend to go with commodities like oil and copper because they are plugged in to global demand, so their fall is significant."</p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures fell 0.26per cent in Asia after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.16per cent gain on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time peaks during trading on Tuesday but stocks ended off session highs after Trump's speech.</p>
      <p>Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on each other's goods in a bitter dispute over Chinese trade practices that the Trump administration says are unfair.</p>
      <p>The standoff has roiled global financial markets and raised the risk of recession for some economies as global trade slows.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, both sides have indicated they were making progress toward an agreement that would potentially scale back some tariffs, but a lack of additional information is starting to unsettle some investors in equities and other riskier assets.</p>
      <p>In a reminder of the potential for further friction, Trump said on Tuesday he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods "very substantially" if China does not agree a deal.</p>
      <p>Onshore spot yuan fell to a low of 7.0270 per dollar at one point in morning trade, the weakest level since Nov. 5, hurt by the fresh Sino-U.S. trade worries.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong stocks slumped as protesters planned to paralyze parts of the Asian financial hub for a third day, with transport, schools and many businesses closing after violence escalated across the city.</p>
      <p>Protesters and police battled through the night at university campuses and other locations only hours after police Senior Superintendent Kwong Wing-cheung said the Chinese-ruled city had been pushed to the "brink of a total breakdown".</p>
      <p>The former British colony has been rocked by nearly five months of protest against Chinese rule, and there is growing concern that the chances of a crackdown by Beijing are rising.</p>
      <p>Chinese shares fell 0.18per cent, while Japanese shares fell 0.76per cent.</p>
      <p>In currencies, the dollar was little changed at 109.09 yen, pulling away slightly from a five-month high reached no Nov. 7.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand dollar surged by more than 1per cent to US$0.6402 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand unexpectedly left interest rates on hold at 1per cent.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose slightly to 1.9260per cent but is likely to move in a narrow range before data due later Wednesday that is forecast to show U.S. consumer prices accelerated slightly in October.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude dipped 0.25per cent to US$56.66 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 0.35per cent to US$61.84 per barrel on worries about weakening demand for oil.</p>
