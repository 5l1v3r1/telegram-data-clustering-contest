      <p>Going back to the hardware itself, the special edition<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/28/apple-launches-airpods-pro-with-noise-cancellation-for-249/"> AirPods Pro</a> are heavier than the original. That’s obviously due to the use of a chunk of gold instead of the lighter plastic. So they probably won’t be as comfortable as the real ones, but does that even matter?</p>
      <p>Cabiar’s brand representative himself admits that:</p>
      <p>Even more often, we notice that wealthy people strive to underline their status with luxurious accessories. Limitedness, precious materials, jewelry elements receive a special popularity. The concept of gold body was born like lightning, because to stand out from the large community of the lovers of technics with an apple logo, one really needs to try hard. We’re sure that the gold edition of Airpods Pro will find its owner and will delight not only with its quality sound, but also wit extraordinary, limited luxuryCaviar</p>

      <p>Aside from the massive amount of gold in the earphones, the rest of the specs stay the same. This means we find an H1 chip, which can achieve up to 5 hours of battery life. While the companion charging box can brig up to 24 hours of additional listening time. There’s also active noise reduction and a feature that helps users find the best fit to their ears through software. This works by using the integrated microphones on the inside and outside of the product.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Apple AirPods Pro Gold Edition by Caviar will go on sale for a whopping $67790. But hey, at least shipping is free!</p>
