      <h3>Pampanga Gov. Dennis “Delta” Pineda handed over P675,000 in cash the other day to 45 former members of “White Area” of the Communist Party of the Philippines who had voluntarily surrendered to the government.</h3>
      <p>The initial assistance of P15,000 for every rebel returnee, was given after Regional Director Police Brigadier General Rhodel Sermonia and Provincial Director Police Colonel Jean Fajardo presented the former rebels to the governor and Vice Gov. Lilia Pineda.</p>
      <p>Sermonia explained that rebels, who came from various parts of Central Luzon, are from “white areas” and do not own firearms but involved in legal front groups which aim to tarnish the government’s reputation.</p>
      <p>The governor also pledged that the former rebels may enjoy the programs and services offered by the provincial government and other government agencies such as medical and educational assistance.</p>
      <p>“Kung wala rin kayong pupuntahan sa probinsya ninyo at wala kayong magiging trabaho, try niyong lumapit sa amin,” he told the returnees.</p>
      <p>Aside from that, the surrenderees are also entitled to receive cash assistance through the Enhanced-Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP).</p>
      <p>According to Myrvi Apostol-Fabia, DILG provincial director, the surrenderees will be initially given P15, 000 eac.</p>
      <p>Fabia added that they shall receive another P50, 000 as livelihood assistance after getting clearance from the Joint Armed Forces of the Philippines-Philippine National Police Intelligence Committee (JAPIC).</p>
