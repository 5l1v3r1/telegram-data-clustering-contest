      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/prakash-javadekar">Prakash Javadekar </a>on Wednesday took charge as the Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, two days after <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arvind-sawant">Arvind Sawant </a>resigned from the Union Cabinet.</p>
      <p>Javadekar also holds information &amp; broadcasting, and environment, forest and climate change portfolios.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters here, Javadekar said he hoped the additional charge was for a temporary period and there will be a regular arrangement in place thereafter.</p>
      <p>"I have assumed charge of heavy industries and the related ministries. I hope it's for temporary period because there will be a regular arrangement thereafter. But, as I was asked I have assumed the charge and will start functioning right from today (Wednesday)," Javadekar told reporters.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Sawant accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of reneging on its promise to the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>for equal division of seats and power and forcing the Uddhav Thackeray-led party to snap ties.</p>
      <p>He alleged that the BJP was resorting to "lies" by denying the agreement reached between the leaders of the two allies before the assembly elections.</p>
      <p>Sawant also said there is no trust left between the parties and it would not be proper to continue as a minister now.</p>
