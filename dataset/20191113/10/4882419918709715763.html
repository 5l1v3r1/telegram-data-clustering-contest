      <h1>Barça defender Lenglet: Buy a Ferrari? It does not appeal to me...</h1>
      <h2>The France centre-back was speaking while with the national team in Paris</h2>

      <p>Maybe he doesn't give the most titles are draw the most praise, but without making much noise Clement Lenglet has earned everyone's confidence at Barcelona and is now a regular for club and country.</p>
      <p>Speaking to 'L'Est Republicain' while with the French national team this week, he opened up about living in the football bubble without having the tastes of many of the game's top players.</p>
      <p>Lenglet came through at Nancy, eventually joining Sevilla for five million euros in 2017 and then moving to Barcelona in 2018. But he says he is still the same person that came through the ranks at a modest French club.</p>
      <p>"I've not changed my lifestyle," he said. "I wasn't a star at Nancy and, for me, I am still not."</p>
      <p>He acknowledges that fame has its drawbacks -- "I see my friends less and I can't go to the cinema anymore" -- but he adds: "But that's all compensated with the great moments I get the opportunity to experience."</p>
      <p>For many footballers, fancy clothes and nice cars are the norm, but Lenglet is not many footballers.</p>
      <p>"I understand the value of money, I'm someone who is reasonable in that respect," he said. "Of course, I live a good life. When I go to the restaurant, if I want a dish that's €40 or even €100, I don't look at the price. But buy a Ferrari, for example? No, they're nice, but it's still just a car and it doesn't appeal to me."</p>
