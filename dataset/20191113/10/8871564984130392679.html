      <h1>Dutchman sentenced to 2 years in prison for illegal wildlife trade in Bali</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:24:32+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>Eric Roer, a 56-year-old man from the Netherlands, has been sentenced to two years in prison after judges at the Denpasar District Court found him guilty of violating Indonesia’s 1990 Conservation Law. </p>
      <p>“Eric Roer is proven guilty of the crime of trading protected species, as laid out in Article 40 of Indonesia’s 1990 Conservation Law… with this he is sentenced to two years in prison and a fine of IDR50 million (US$3,554),” <a href="https://kumparan.com/kanalbali/wna-belanda-yang-menyelundupkantulang-satwa-dilindungi-divonis-2-tahun-1sFG92mWfpC">judge Heriyanti said yesterday, as quoted by <i>Kumparan.</i></a></p>
      <p>Roer’s final sentence is lower than what the <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/bali-prosecutor-demands-dutch-national-be-sentenced-to-3-years-for-illegal-wildlife-trade/">prosecutors previously demanded</a>, which was three years in prison and a fine of IDR100 million. </p>
      <p><a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/dutch-national-in-bali-prosecuted-for-involvement-in-international-illegal-wildlife-trade-network/">Police in Bali handed evidence of Roer’s crime</a> to public prosecutors earlier this year in August, around three years after they began investigating the case. </p>
      <p>The Dutchman’s offenses encompass the shipment of protected items from Indonesia, including skulls of various animals like crocodiles and sea turtles, as well as snakeskin. According to authorities, these items were sold for hefty prices abroad: ranging between IDR50 to 80 million each, though they were purchased for only around IDR1 million each in the Southeast Asian country.</p>
