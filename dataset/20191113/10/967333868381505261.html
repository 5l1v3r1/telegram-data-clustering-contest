The Constitutional Court confirmed the legality of the transfer of power.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911121077290850-mexican-foreign-minister-welcomes-ex-bolivian-president--evo-morales-in-mexico/">Morales stepped down Sunday</a> after the Bolivian Armed Forces sided with demonstrators protesting his electoral victory on 20 October. A preliminary report of the Organisation of American States found what they called "grave" irregularities in the vote.</p>
      <p>Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua have described the events in Bolivia — accompanied by violent rallies, attacks on officials, arson incidents, and occupation of buildings — as a coup. Russia has similarly said that the opposition's steps resembled an "orchestrated coup".</p>
