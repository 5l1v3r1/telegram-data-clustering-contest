      <p>HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. â€” All through November, a Hillsborough County entrepreneurial group is welcoming Veteran owned businesses.</p>
      <p>1 Million Cups helps business owners connect with the community, get their business started and hear feedback from other business owners.</p>
      <p>ClienTell, started by Veteran Chris Walker, is an app to allow contractors to review clients.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"The feedback that we get allows us to vet our own business model and make sure we're on the right path," says Walker.</p>
      <p>For Hillsborough County, it's a win-win.</p>
      <p>"The county recognizes the value of our veterans. A lot of them come out of the military and transition right into being business owners," says Hillsborough County Entrepreneur Collaborative's Lynn Kresen.</p>
      <p>Because of MacDill and CentCom, Hillsborough County officials say a lot of veterans stay in the community after retirement and launch their own businesses.</p>
