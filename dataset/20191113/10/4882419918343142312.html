      <p>Former Real Madrid coach Santiago Solari returns to the club nine months after being sacked from his role by president Florentino Perez.</p>
      <p>The former Madrid player and manager will take on an ambassador role at the Santiago Bernabeu, according to El Larguero, with the aim of representing the club and promoting its image across the world.</p>
      <p>Solari played for the club and then managed the B team, Real Madrid Castilla. When Julen Lopetegui was sacked last season, he was then handed the first-team job.</p>
      <p>After an encouraging start, things quickly went sour and he was eventually sacked and replaced by Zinedine Zidane shortly after the Champions League elimination to Ajax.</p>
      <p>However, his reputation remains intact at the club due to everything he has done in the past and he has been welcomed back in a new role out of the public eye.</p>
