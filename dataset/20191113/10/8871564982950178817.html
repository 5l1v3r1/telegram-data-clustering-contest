      <h1>Village residents in Yogyakarta shut down interfaith prayer ceremony, accusing organizer of ‘religious deviation’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:31:19+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Yogyakarta has seen a rise in religious intolerance over the last few years, and the latest instance took place just yesterday. A Buddhist and Hindu prayer ceremony in Mangir Lor village, Bantul regency was cancelled mid-event as it was allegedly shut down by the village residents.</p>
      <p>According to Mangir Lor village chief Lha Lha Setiawan, the residents accused the organizers, a religious group named Paguyuban Padma Buwana, of “deviating from religious teachings.”</p>
      <p>“That was said by someone from the Religious Affairs Ministry during a mediation at the sub-village office [in 2018]. What’s clear is the ritual had been participated in by believers of several religions, but they performed the ritual of one religion,” Setiawan said yesterday, <a href="https://tirto.id/upacara-doa-keagamaan-di-bantul-dihentikan-warga-ely2">as quoted by </a><i><a href="https://tirto.id/upacara-doa-keagamaan-di-bantul-dihentikan-warga-ely2">Tirto</a>. </i></p>
      <p>The ceremony was held at the home of Utiek Suprapti, a village resident belonging to the Hindu minority and also head of the religious group. Setiawan claimed that Utiek had signed a statement back in 2012, in which she said she wouldn’t conduct any ritual ceremony without permit. </p>
      <p>In spite of that, she still held a number of ceremonies since, inviting people from other regions without permission from authorities in the village. According to Setiawan, this went on until the mediation in 2018.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Mangir Lor village residents reported Utiek to the local police upon finding out about a planned ritual ceremony. Setiawan said the residents were on standby near Utiek’s house when the police arrived to stop the ceremony. </p>
      <p>However, Bantul Police Chief Wachyu Tri Budi denied that the prayer ceremony had been interrupted by anyone. </p>
      <p>“No one stopped the activity at Ibu Utiek’s place. Evidently, the activity was still carried out by Ibu Utiek. There was indeed a question from the residents if there was any permit to establish [her house] as a place of religious ceremony or religious activities,”  Wachyu said.</p>
      <p>In contrast to Setiawan and Wachyu’s separate statements, Utiek said she has already received a permit from authorities. She explained that the villagers started to surround her house at around 3pm during the first session of the ceremony.</p>
      <p>“I have the authentic proof of signatures from my neighbors from the left and right [of my home], and it’s also been signed by the neighborhood chief,” Utiek told <i>Tirto</i>, as she reportedly showed the signed permit.</p>
      <p>She said this wasn’t the first time a ceremony was interrupted by the villagers, alluding to what happened previously in 2012. She said her group has been rejected by a certain community organization. </p>
      <p>“We were suspected of <i>berhala </i>[worshipping anyone or anything besides God] Those who demanded us to cancel the event [in 2012] were the same people,” Utiek <a href="https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1271555/pembubaran-upacara-ki-ageng-mangir-di-bantul-bukan-yang-pertama/full&amp;view=ok">told </a><i><a href="https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1271555/pembubaran-upacara-ki-ageng-mangir-di-bantul-bukan-yang-pertama/full&amp;view=ok">Tempo</a> </i><a href="https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1271555/pembubaran-upacara-ki-ageng-mangir-di-bantul-bukan-yang-pertama/full&amp;view=ok">yesterday</a>.</p>
      <p>Utiek explained that the ceremony, which is rooted in the Balinese Hindu tradition, was held to commemorate the death of her ancestor, who was a Hindu religious leader. Her home has also become a pilgrimage destination for several Hindus from Bali.</p>
      <p>Yogyakarta is sadly no stranger to religious discrimination. In April, the residency of a Catholic man and his family in a hamlet of Karet in Bantul was opposed by the residents on the grounds that he’s not a Muslim. </p>
      <p>He later found out that the hamlet had a regulation in place prohibiting non-Muslims from residing in the community, which was passed in 2015. The man was initially allowed to stay only for six months, but the <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/man-yogyakarta-challenges-village-regulation-prohibiting-staying-hes-not-muslim-wins/">discriminatory regulation has finally been removed thanks to his effort</a>.</p>
      <p>In December of last year, Muslim residents in the city<a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/wooden-cross-grave-marker-sawed-off-jogjakarta-amid-request-muslim-residents/"> forced a family to saw off a wooden cross-shaped grave marker</a> belonging to their recently deceased loved one, on the grounds that they had plans to turn the cemetery into a Muslim-exclusive burial area.</p>
