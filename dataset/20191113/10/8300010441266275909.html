      <p>LOS ANGELES, California -- R&amp;B crooner John Legend has been named the Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine.<br/><br/>The Grammy-winning singer known for his silky-smooth vocals was revealed as this year's winner on Tuesday night.<br/><br/>The 40-year-old Legend is a 10-time Grammy winner. He scored an Oscar in 2015 for co-writing the song "Glory" from the film "Selma." He won a Tony Award for his co-producer work on "Jitney" and took home an Emmy as a producer of the live television version of "Jesus Christ Superstar," a project in which he also played the role of Jesus.<br/><br/>Legend, a 1999 alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, has two children with model-television host-cookbook author Chrissy Teigen.<br/><br/>He said his wife is proud of him, "I've finally impressed her," he said.<br/><br/>The couple's children? Not so much. Teigen posted a video of the reveal of their daughter asking to turn off the announcement and watch a movie. Teigen titled the post "The kids ... do not care."</p>
