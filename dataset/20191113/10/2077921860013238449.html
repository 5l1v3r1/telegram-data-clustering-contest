      <h1>Auli'i Cravalho to Star Alongside Leslie Mann in Amazon's The Power</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:58:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:58</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p>Auli’i Cravalho is set to star alongside <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/leslie-mann-stars-in-the-power-new-amazon-series.html">Leslie Mann</a> in new Amazon series <i>The Power</i>, per <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/auli%ca%bbi-cravalho-cast-amazon-series-the-power-based-on-naomi-aldermans-book-leslie-mann-1202784489/"><i>Deadline</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The 10-episode thriller/drama is an adaption of Naomi Alderman’s 2016 feminist sci-fi book of the same title, in which all teenage girls in the world develop the power to electrocute people at will.</p>
      <p>While Mann plays a politician on the rise, Margot Cleary-Lopez, Mayor of Seattle, Cravalho, who most recently played Ariel in <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/live-musicals-on-tv-ranked.html">The Little Mermaid Live!</a></i>, will be taking on the role of Mann’s daughter, Jos. As <i>Deadline</i> explains:</p>
      <p>Margot comes to see that power resides with strength rather than authority. As her career takes flight, it’s her husband Rob and daughter Jos who privately feel the effects of her success most keenly; for one of them, where previously there was conflict now comes a greater understanding, and for the other where there was love, comes hurt and betrayal.</p>
      <p>The <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/moana.html">Moana</a></i> star is currently filming her first non-animated film role, Brett Haley’s <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> feature <i>Sorta Like a Rock Star</i>.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/05/the-handmaids-tale-season-three-trailer.html">The Handmaid’s Tale</a> </i>’s Reed Morano is directing and executive producing <i>The Power</i>, and Alderman will be leading an all-female writers’ room that includes co-executive producer Claire Wilson, co-executive producer and story consultant Sarah Quintrell, and novelist Rebecca Levene.</p>
