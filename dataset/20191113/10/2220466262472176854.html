      <p>BEIRUT: On the 28th day of the revolution, protesters expressed their grief with chants and candles in honour of protester Alaa Abou Fakher, who was shot and killed on Tuesday night in Khaldeh.An army statement said a soldier opened fire to disperse the crowd after an altercation, hitting Abou Fakher, identified as a local official with the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and member of the Choueifat municipality. The statement also added that an investigation has been opened following the soldier’s arrest.Abou Fakher was briefly hospitalized in a critical condition to Kamal Jumblatt Hospital before succumbing to his wounds.PSP leader Walid Jumblatt and his son MP Taymur Jumblatt arrived at the hospital around midnight, where the Druze leader urged demonstrators to “count on the state only” or to avoid a "phase of chaos."Caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri also emphasized Jumblatt’s statement on Twitter, reminding "everyone of their responsibility to protect the country and to collaborate in order to face our challenges.”Infuriated protesters and Abou Fakher’s PSP comrades described him as “the revolution’s martyr.”Lawyer Tony Mikhael expressed on Twitter how “harsh" the scene of Abou Fakher's passing was, describing it as "a scene that shakes thrones and emotions.”Joseph Chidiac, a protestor, described to Annahar his dismay at the death of a man "who was demanding his basic human rights in front of his kids."“Will innocent men and women forever be killed in this country? When will this stop?” he asked.     Related Articles <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1067550-french-envoy-seeks-to-resolve-deadlock-as-tensions-simmer">French envoy seeks to resolve deadlock as tensions simmer </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1067508-pure-revolution-vs-authoritarian-leaders-and-a-cautious-intelligentsia"> Pure revolution vs. authoritarian leaders and a cautious intelligentsia</a></p>
