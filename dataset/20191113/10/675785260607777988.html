      <h2>EastEnders fans are not entirely convinced Mel Owen is dead after a car crash, while scenes appeared to show her die in the latest episode</h2>

      <p>EastEnders viewers are thinking there's another big twist on the way, as a car crash in the most recent episode appeared to leave Mel Owen dead.</p>
      <p>While they wait for the next episode to see if Mel will really die, it has been confirmed that actress Tamzin Outhwaite is leaving the role with her final scenes already filmed.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Mel's desperation for revenge and to expose Sharon Mitchell's fling and baby secret led to tragedy.</p>
      <p>Not paying attention to the road as she prepared to spill all about Keanu Taylor being the father of Sharon's baby to all those at the club, including his pregnant fiancée Louise, she collided head on with another car.</p>
      <p>Sharon looked on in horror as the vehicle ahead of her flipped and smashed to the ground.</p>

      <p>The episode ended with Mel's hand hanging out of the overturned car, while her fate is not known.</p>
      <p>Now, fans think it could all be a red herring and that Mel might survive the crash.</p>
      <p>There's two big theories circulating by eagle-eyed viewers, and those that know the soap pretty damn well.</p>

      <p>One fan claimed the leaking petrol could be a hint that Mel might be alive for now, with the soap heading for a repeat of her husband Steve Owen's death in 2002.</p>
      <p>He faced a similar fate when he crashed his car after a chase with Sharon's husband Phil Mitchell, but his car exploded and he was killed.</p>
      <p>Fans are speculating after several nods to the past including the Steve stunt and Sharongate, that maybe Mel will survive only to be killed in an explosion.</p>

      <p>Another theory is that Mel will live to tell the tale, literally, with a potential return around Christmas giving her the path to finally expose Sharon - with it known Christmas will see Sheanu rumbled.</p>
      <p>Others think it's just too similar to Steve's own crash to have Mel face the same fate - but isn't that the point in the storyline and the nostalgic nod to the past? The Owens are cursed it seems after all.</p>
      <p>Viewers now face an anxious wait until Thursday's episode, when Mel's fate will be revealed.</p>
      <p>Fans will also find out if Sharon can keep her secret that little bit longer, with the walls closing in on her and Keanu.</p>
