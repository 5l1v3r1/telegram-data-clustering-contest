      <h1>Summer Walker Cuts Tour Short Due To Social Anxiety Struggle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:39:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/cherise.johnson" target="_blank">Cherise Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles, CA – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/videos/id.27162/title.summer-walker-cpr">Summer Walker</a> is truly over it. From having to deal with people online judging her choice to wear a certain loc style to becoming a trending topic over people assuming she has poor hygiene because she doesn’t like showers (not baths), it’s been a mentally draining time for the 23-year-old burgeoning R&amp;B singer who clearly hates touring.</p>
      <p>In October, Summer released her debut album <i><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53029/title.summer-walker-shares-over-it-album">Over It</a></i>, which gracefully <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53142/title.summer-walkers-over-it-makes-history">broke Beyoncé’s streaming record</a> for <i>Lemonade</i> and now she’s been performing city-to-city for her tour, which has been cut down due to her struggles with social anxiety.</p>
      <p>“Hey y’all I truly appreciate all the support and love,” Summer said in a statement. “As you know, I have been very open about my struggle with social anxiety. I want to continue to be healthy and to make music for y’all, so I have decided to cut down some of the dates on the tour. I hope you all can understand. I’m grateful for every single one of you, and I hope that you understand that wellness is important.”</p>

      <p>Summer seems to be committed to only nine dates at this point, with the entire trek wrapping December 22 in Atlanta. Those who purchased tickets for the canceled dates will receive a full refund.</p>
      <p>The “<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50448/title.drake-hops-on-summer-walkers-girls-need-love-remix">Girls Need Love</a>” singer isn’t the first artist to cancel future shows in order to take care of their mental wellness. <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.4352/title.tweets-is-watching-lil-nas-x-says-hes-taking-a-little-time-off">Lil Nas X</a> recently announced his break from the music industry, after canceling two confirmed shows and future festival appearances.</p>
      <p>Check out the remaining dates for Summer Walker’s First and Last Tour below.</p>
      <p>Nov 12 — San Francisco<br/>Nov 25 — Toronto<br/>Nov 26 — Chicago<br/>Nov 27 — Royal Oak<br/>Dec 2 — Boston<br/>Dec 5 — Philadelphia<br/>Dec 7 — NYC<br/>Dec 8 — NYC<br/>Dec 22 — Atlanta</p>
