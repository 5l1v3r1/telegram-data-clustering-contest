      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8543321/michael-stipe-celebrating-monster-anniversary-debut-solo-single"><i>Billboard</i></a>, the former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/REM">R.E.M.</a> frontman, who came out as gay in 1994, said he believed the other members of the band knew about his sexuality long before he came out.</p>
      <p>“I was never closeted,” Stipe said. “That’s the thing that’s beautiful about it and I’m so proud of. You can never find a single picture of me pretending to have a girlfriend or being somebody that I’m not.</p>
      <p>“I was never that guy. Any longstanding R.E.M. fan who had not figured out I was queer before that point wasn’t looking very hard.”</p>
      <p>In the same interview, Stipe also said it was the “right decision” to disband R.E.M in 2011 because it allowed fans to take a step back and reflect on the band’s legacy.</p>
      <p>The frontman said: “Encapsulating the creative work of the band by disbanding allowed us, and I think the rest of the world, to take a step back and look at it for what it was. We were not the guys who were going to always be there, and I think that did us a huge favour, honestly.”</p>

For me, that was just a privacy issue.</p>
      <p>“As a public figure I had exposed myself so much, and I wanted to keep something for myself. It reached a point where that was ridiculous and I decided to speak publicly about it – which I’m happy I did of course.”</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the band’s 25-year anniversary of ‘Monster’, Stipe said: “A lot had happened to us and in the world since our last world tour in 1989. Culture had shifted, politics had shifted, things had changed dramatically. We were a part of that change, or perhaps inspired part of that in music and culture. Then we put out these two records that were multi-million-selling.“</p>
