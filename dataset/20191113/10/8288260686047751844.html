      <p>A multi-millionaire who was jailed for leaving his girlfriend to die after a 'rough sex' session is set to appeal his sentence.</p>
      <p>Property developer John Broadhurst <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/multi-millionaire-jailed-lovers-death-15562932">admitted the gross negligence manslaughter of mother-of-one Natalie Connolly</a> in December last year.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old was jailed for three years and eight months - a sentence described as 'unduly lenient' sentence by <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/millionaire-could-see-jail-term-15570803">Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman</a> .</p>
      <p>An outraged Ms Harman urged the Attorney General to review the sentence, a request which was refused - however now there is a possibility the jail term could be cut.</p>

      <p>Ms Connolly was found lying in the hallway at her home she shared with Broadhurst in Kinver, near Stourbridge, in December 2016.</p>
      <p>The court was told Broadhurst had gone to bed and left her there after a night of drinking.</p>
      <p>She had serious internal trauma, along with more than 40 separate injuries. A post mortem revealed her cause of death was due to acute alcohol intoxication and blunt force injuries.</p>
      <p>Broadhurst, now of Blakeshall Farm in Wolverley, was cleared of murdering Natalie and causing her grievous bodily harm on the directions of the judge following legal submissions part-way through his trial at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/courts">Birmingham Crown Court</a> .</p>
      <p>As he jailed Broadhurst for 44 months, Mr Justice Julian Knowles told the father-of-three: "You were capable of taking decisions and making choices. This was grossly irresponsible behaviour by you.</p>
      <p>"You left that vulnerable young woman to die in the saddest and most avoidable of circumstances. You showed blatant disregard for a very drunk and injured woman."</p>
      <p>However after serving almost a year of his sentence, Broadhurst has launched an appeal and his case is due to be heard at the Court of Appeal tomorrow (Thursday, November 14).</p>
