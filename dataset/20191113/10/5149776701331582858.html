      <h1>Derby County sacking defender Richard Keogh takes fresh twist</h1>
      <h2>Keogh has formally appealed against Nottingham Forest's arch-rivals' decision to sack him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:23:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Watson</a></address>
      <p>Richard Keogh has formally appealed against Derby County's decision to sack him.</p>
      <p>Keogh was dismissed by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>'s arch-rivals on grounds of gross misconduct at the end of last month, and his contract terminated with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland international was given 14 days to appeal against the decision.</p>
      <p>As expected, the central defender has now taken up that option, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/richard-keogh-responds-derby-county-3531627">Derbyshire Live</a> understands.</p>
      <p>Keogh is facing at least a year out of action after sustaining a serious knee injury in a car crash that resulted in Rams team-mates Tom Lawrence and Mason Bennett being convicted of drink-driving.</p>
      <p>Lawrence and Bennett were punished in the courts and fined by their club - but remain on the books.</p>
      <p>Keogh has the backing of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and will fight his dismissal.</p>
      <p>The Rams will now take time to consider his appeal.</p>
