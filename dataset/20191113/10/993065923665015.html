      <p>A GROUP of patients caught up in the neurology recall scandal staged a protest outside the Department of Health yesterday to demand “answers” from its most senior civil servant.</p>
      <p>Politicians accompanied former patients of Dr Michael Watt, 18 months after the biggest recall in Northern Ireland’s healthcare system was first ordered following concerns about the consultant’s work.</p>
      <p>They wanted to meet with the department’s permanent secretary, Richard Pengelly, to deliver a letter outlining their frustration about being “left in the dark” about the case.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Mr Pengelly was not available. Dr Watt, who was based at the Royal Victoria Hospital for 20 years, saw people from across the north with a wide range of brain-related conditions including Multiple Sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke and Parkinson’s disease.</p>
      <p>An “outcomes report” into the number of patients who were misdiagnosed and given the wrong drugs was due to be published in the summer but was withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Assembly members including the SDLP’s Nichola Mallon, Sinn Féin’s Pat Sheehan and Gerry Carroll from People Before Profit also took part in yesterday’s protest.</p>
