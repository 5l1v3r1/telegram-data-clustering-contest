      <p>The Japanese government has said that it would scrap next year's annual cherry blossom party after Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/shinzo-abe.html">Shinzo Abe</a> came under fire amid claims he invited too many of his own supporters.</p>
      <p>The publicly funded event has taken place in a Tokyo park every year since 1952 to honour people for their achievements, with the great and the good of Japanese political life mingling under the world-famous cherry blossom trees.</p>
      <p>But opposition politicians have taken aim at Abe, claiming he brought along 850 supporters from his local constituency for the festival, reportedly costing about 55 million yen ($504,000) from the public purse.</p>
      <p>In a surprise announcement on Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that the government had "listened to various opinions" and as a result, decided to shelve next year's party.</p>
      <p>Suga also pledged that the government would "clarify the criteria for inviting guests and make the invitation process transparent".</p>
      <p>The number of guests invited to the event is steadily increasing and so is the budget.</p>
      <p>Local news agency Kyodo News said about 18,000 people took part this year - up from between 7,000 and 10,000 from before Abe came to power in 2012.</p>
      <p>The 55 million yen spent last year is also nearly double the budget from 2014, according to Kyodo News.</p>
      <p>Japan's cherry blossom (or sakura) season is eagerly anticipated by locals and visitors alike.</p>
      <p>The season is traditionally celebrated with hanami, or viewing parties, in cherry blossom hotspots, with picnics organised beneath the trees.</p>
      <p>In general, blooms begin as early as March in the southern island of Kyushu and appear as late as May in northernmost Hokkaido.</p>
