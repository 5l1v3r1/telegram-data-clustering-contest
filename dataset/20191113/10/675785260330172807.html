      <p>Former Wales boss Warren Gatland has opened up on the heartbreaking death of his first daughter, aged just four months.</p>
      <p>Gatland's wife Trudi gave birth to baby Shauna in Ireland in January 1992 - but she was tragically born with spina bifida.</p>
      <p>Wales boss Gatland reveals in his upcoming autobiography <i>Pride and Passion</i> that he and Trudi were given an "awful dilemma" to either subject Shauna to a series of long and gruelling operations - or to "let nature take its course".</p>
      <p>“When Shauna was born, in the early hours of 17 January 1992, our world changed,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Whatever problems she had didn’t register with me at the moment of birth. But there were tears in the eyes of the nursing staff.</p>

      <p>“The nurses knew deep down her condition was serious and an immediate scan confirmed the worst. We were devastated."</p>
      <p>Gatland said of the heartbreaking decision he and his wife had to make: "That was the hardest, most gut-wrenching conversation of my life.</p>

      <p>“Even if the medical side went to plan, even if she fought like a lion to survive, what kind of life would be on offer to her?” said Gatland.</p>
      <p>Gatland and Trudi opted to take the "kinder" approach and Shauna died on May 13 1992.</p>
      <p>They moved back to New Zealand following the birth but Gatland admits "profound and lasting" regret at being in Australia with the Waikato provincial side when Shauna died.</p>
