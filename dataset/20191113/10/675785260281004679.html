      <h1>Real Madrid eye 'world record £340m transfer move for Kylian Mbappe'</h1>
      <h2>Mbappe, 20, is believed to be pushing for a dream switch to the Bernabeu having been linked with a move to Spain before he joined PSG from Monaco</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:33:18+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Real Madrid are weighing up a world-record £343million move for Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p>Mbappe has been strongly linked with a big-money move in the summer, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> among the teams understood to be keen on signing the French World Cup winner.</p>
      <p>The French World Cup winner, 20, is believed to be pushing for a dream switch to the Bernabeu having been linked with a move to Spain before he joined PSG from Monaco.</p>
      <p>And <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/">Le Parisien</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/real-considering-world-record-e400-million-bid-for-mbappe-14249"> CalcioMercato</a> , claim that Madrid are considering a bid of €400million (£343m) to prise the talented forward away from Paris.</p>

      <p>Should the move materialise, it would surpass the current world record transfer fee which was paid by PSG to sign Neymar from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> for £198m in 2017.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane denied trying to unsettle Mbappe as he stays focused on getting the best out of his own squad.</p>
      <p>PSG sporting director Leonardo criticised the French coach for making "irritating" and "annoying" comments over Mbappe having a "dream" to one day play for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>Zidane, though, maintained he was not talking out of turn, just repeating what the 20-year-old World Cup winner himself had previously revealed.</p>

      <p>"I've said nothing, just what the player said, that his dream was one day to play here. Everyone does what they want," the Real Madrid manager told a press conference.</p>
      <p>"I'll not say anything else. I simply said what the player said one day, that his dream would be to wear the Real Madrid jersey.</p>
      <p>"I say it again and I would say it every day. I have nothing more to say about Leonardo, I can say whatever I want."</p>
