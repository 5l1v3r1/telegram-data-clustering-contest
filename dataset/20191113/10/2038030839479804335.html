      <h1>Prince Charles shares his first ever Instagram post</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:56:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Judy Philander</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - The Prince of Wales penned his first Instagram post, which he shared on Tuesday ahead of his trip to India, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1092662/prince-charles-shares-his-first-ever-instagram-post"><b>E! Online</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>While the 70-year-old Prince of Wales' office often shares updates on his and wife Camilla’s official royal duties, this marks the first time that Prince Charles himself shared a statement on social media, <a href="https://people.com/royals/prince-charles-shares-his-first-ever-instagram-post-ahead-of-trip-to-india/"><b>People</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>The photo features himself and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, during their trip to India in 2017, and includes a lengthy caption, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-charles-shares-first-instagram-post"><b>FOX News</b></a> reports.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that a British royal personally shared a message rather than have their social media account managers do it for them.</p>
      <p>Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, launched their own Instagram account and their first post featured a quote from the couple in the caption. And in March, Queen Elizabeth signed off on her own first Instagram post in honour of her visit to the Science Museum in London.</p>
      <p>It seems Prince Charles has taken a page out of their book.</p>
