      <h1>Liverpool left sweating on fitness of Mohamed Salah as Egyptian is seen wearing protective boot</h1>
      <h2>Reds forward Salah has been struggling with an ankle problem since early October and the injury was aggravated by a kick from Fernandinho on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:46:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have been left sweating on the fitness of Mohamed Salah after the forward was seen in a protective boot while away with Egypt.</p>
      <p>Salah will not play for his country in matches against Kenya and Comoros and was seen in the boot at a training session.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has had an ankle issue since early October after being caught by Leicester's Hamza Choudhury in the 2-1 win at Anfield.</p>
      <p>And the problem was exacerbated when he received a heavy knock from Fernandinho as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> 3-1 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He came off in the second half and had his ankle strapped with ice by the Reds' medical team.</p>

      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: "I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that it always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>
      <p>The Reds have a congested fixture list the other side of the international break - and Salah could miss some big games if the injury keeps him out of action.</p>
      <p>Liverpool take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> at Selhurst Park a week on Saturday before hosting Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday November 27.</p>

      <p>They then take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> at Anfield before hosting <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> in the first Merseyside derby of the season on December 4.</p>
      <p>Defender Andy Robertson is also an injury concern for Liverpool having pulled out of the Scotland squad. He too has an ankle issue.</p>
