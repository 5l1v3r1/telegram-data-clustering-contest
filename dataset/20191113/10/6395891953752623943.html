      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Administrative hearings have been set for the 25 Ohio nurses accused of giving excessive painkillers to patients who died and not questioning the medication ordered by a doctor now charged with murder.</p>
      <p>Those nurses from the Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus aren't being criminally prosecuted but face possible discipline by the Ohio Board of Nursing.</p>
      <p>The board says each nurse was entitled to request a hearing before any action is taken, and all of them did so. The first hearing is scheduled in February, and the last in March 2021.</p>
      <p>For now, their licenses remain active. Mount Carmel won't comment on individuals' employment status but has said it fired some of the nurses involved.</p>
      <p>The doctor, William Husel (HYOO'-suhl), has pleaded not guilty to 25 counts of murder.</p>
