      <p>FC Barcelona have presented their fourth shirt for the 2019-20 season, a shirt that touches on the club's Catalan identity.</p>
      <p>"With the tagline Ho portem dins (‘It’s deep within us’), FC Barcelona is presenting a new kit for this season that features the Catalan flag, the senyera, in honour of the club’s roots and history," a statement said.</p>
      <p>"Over 120 years the club has grown as an entity that is open to the world, and which views sport as a phenomenon that can build bridges between people. However, this has not meant losing its sense of Catalan identity, culture and values.</p>
      <p>"The new design features a modern look in which the four red stripes appear diagonally across a yellow background.</p>
      <p>"Another highlight is the retro style V-neck, while the shorts are in the same yellow hue as the shirt to create a sense of continuity from top to bottom. The socks are also yellow, with four red hoops and the Nike logo and the word Barça in blue."</p>
      <p>Barça plan to wear the new shirt for the first time when they play Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano on Dec. 1.</p>
