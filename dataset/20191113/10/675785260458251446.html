      <p>It’s an annoying habit that will have you trying to drink out of a cup backwards or standing on your head to cure, but it seems that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/how-stop-your-annoying-hiccups-9636115">hiccups</a> may actually serve a crucial purpose.</p>
      <p>In a new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weird-science">study</a> , scientists from University College London have revealed why we hiccup, and why the habit is so important.</p>
      <p>The researchers found that hiccups are crucial for brain development in babies, triggering electrical activity in the brain that helps youngsters to regulate their breathing.</p>
      <p>Dr Kimberley Whitehead, lead author of the study, said: "The reasons for why we hiccup are not entirely clear, but there may be a developmental reason, given that foetuses and newborn babies hiccup so frequently."</p>
      <p>Pre-term infants - babies who are born more than three weeks before the due date - are particularly prone to hiccups as they spend approximately 1% of their time - around 15 minutes a day - hiccuping.</p>

      <p>Hiccuping can also be observed in the womb - sometimes as early as nine weeks into the pregnancy.</p>
      <p>The study, published in the Clinical Neurophysiology, was based on brain scans of 13 pre-term and full-term babies, ranging from 30 to 42 weeks gestational age.</p>
      <p>Brain activity was recorded with electrodes attached to the scalp, while hiccuping movements were monitored with sensors on the babies' torso.</p>
      <p>The contractions of the diaphragm muscle from a hiccup corresponded with a pronounced response in the brain's cortex in the form of three brainwaves, the researchers noted.</p>
      <p>They believe the third brainwave may link the "hic" sound of the hiccup with the feeling of the muscle contraction in the diaphragm.</p>
      <p>Dr Lorenzo Fabrizi, a senior research fellow at the University College London's department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, and the study's senior author, said: "The activity resulting from a hiccup may be helping the baby's brain to learn how to monitor the breathing muscles so that eventually breathing can be voluntary controlled by moving the diaphragm up and down.</p>
      <p>"When we are born, the circuits which process body sensations are not fully developed, so the establishment of such networks is a crucial developmental milestone for newborns."</p>
      <p>Although the cause of hiccups in adults still remains unknown, certain things like stress, excitement or eating and drinking can trigger the muscle contraction.</p>
      <p>Ms Whitehead said: "Our findings have prompted us to wonder whether hiccups in adults, which appear to be mainly a nuisance, may in fact by a vestigial reflex, left over from infancy when it had an important function."</p>
