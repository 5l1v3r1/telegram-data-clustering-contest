      <p>Model <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chrissy-teigen">Chrissy Teigen</a> has responded hilariously to her husband, singer <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JohnLegend">John Legend</a>, being named “sexiest man alive”.</p>
      <p>After been granted the title by <i>People</i> magazine, the 10-time <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/grammys">Grammy Award</a> winner said he felt “excited” and “a little scared” by the pressure of following in the footsteps of actor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/idris-elba">Idris Elba</a>, who was crowned “sexiest man alive” last year.</p>
      <p>While many people have been congratulating Legend on his latest accolade, his spouse has responded in a comically sardonic manner to her husband’s recognition.</p>
      <p>“I have fulfilled my dream of having boned @people’s sexiest man alive!! An honour!!!!!” Teigen tweeted, having changed her Twitter bio to read: “Currently sleeping with <i>People</i>’s sexiest man alive.”</p>
      <p>The <i>Lip Sync Battle</i> co-host added that she “cannot wait for people to get mad about John being the sexiest man alive”.</p>
      <p>Following <i>People</i>‘s announcement, Legend tweeted a smouldering photograph of Elba alongside one of himself taken 24 years ago, stating that “1995 John would be very perplexed” to be succeeding the <i>Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw </i>star.</p>
      <p>Teigen weighed in on the discussion, stating: “Yeah but let’s see an @idriselba pic from 1995 (prob still very hot).”</p>
      <p>The model also shared a video on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SocialMedia">social media</a> of the couple’s children, Miles and Luna, being informed of their father’s new award.</p>
      <p>“I want to watch the movie mum,” three-year-old Luna says in the video, which Teigen captioned: “The kids... do not care.”</p>
      <p>The television personality later informed her Twitter followers that it is business as usual in the Stephens household, writing: “The sexiest man alive just made me a ham sandwich.”</p>
      <p>Several Twitter users found humour in Teigen’s responses to Legend’s “sexiest man alive” title.</p>
      <p>“You’re having too much fun with this,” one person <a href="https://twitter.com/leximitchelll/status/1194448722781986817?s=20">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m glad you’ll be there to keep him humble,” another <a href="https://twitter.com/ChynnaTown11/status/1194452273046245377?s=20">remarked</a>.</p>
