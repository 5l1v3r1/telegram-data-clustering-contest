      <h1>Ethereum’s Hearthstone Rival Sets Volume Record After Blizzard Scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:22:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Ethereum (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>) based trading card game Gods Unchained has far outstripped <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptokitties">CryptoKitties</a> by volume after a censorship scandal involving game-developer Blizzard.</p>
      <p>As blockchain research platform <a href="https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-44c">Coin Metrics</a> noted on Nov. 12, the past month has seen activity explode for the game, with interest dwarfing that of CryptoKitties at its 2017 peak.</p>
      <h3>Data: Gods Unchained volume five times higher</h3>
      <p>In terms of daily transfers of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Gods Unchained was recording almost 500,000 such transfers per day at the end of last week.</p>
      <p>By contrast, even at the height of the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptokitties-sales-hit-12-million-could-be-ethereums-killer-app-after-all">CryptoKitties craze</a> in late 2017, transfers there totaled less than 100,000.</p>
      <p>The data underscores the backlash against Blizzard, the developer behind titles such as World of Warcraft, which last month became embroiled in a PR disaster involving China.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blizzard-bans-hearthstone-player-blockchain-comes-to-rescue">reported</a>, the company rescinded prize money from the top player of its Hearthstone game, Chung Ng Wai (aka Blitzchung), after the latter voiced support for the Hong Kong protest movement.</p>
      <p>Gods Unchained capitalized on the event, offering replacement winnings and other perks to Chung in a tweet which has now received over 33,000 retweets.</p>
      <h3>Price of control</h3>
      <p>As Coin Metrics notes, like Hearthstone, CryptoKitties players had considerably less control of their assets due to centralization.</p>
      <p>“...Unlike Hearthstone, Gods Unchained is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and each one of its cards is represented by an ERC-721 token. This means that users truly own their cards and can trade them freely on the open market, similar to any other cryptocurrency,” it summarizes.</p>
      <p>Somewhat ironically, Chinese authorities themselves subsequently went public with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/study-chinese-blockchain-spending-to-exceed-2b-by-2023">an endorsement</a> of blockchain technology. </p>
      <p>At the end of last month, a raft of headlines emerged, among which was advice not to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-warns-against-cryptocurrency-speculation-amid-blockchain-hype">speak badly</a> of blockchain or mistake the support for a shift in policy regarding cryptocurrencies.</p>
