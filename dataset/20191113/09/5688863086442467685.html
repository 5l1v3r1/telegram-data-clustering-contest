        <b>Former cricketer and Bangladesh spin coach Sunil Joshi believes it’s not just the spinners in the Bangladesh team who need to fire but they need to match up to India in terms of batting. The veteran left-arm spinner was with the Bangladesh team for two years and has groomed their spinners well.</b>

      <p>Bangladesh, who are touring India currently, have a big contest ahead of them with the Test series coming up. Despite outplaying India in the first match in Delhi, Bangladesh lost the three-match T20I series by 2-1. With the two match Test series coming up, which also includes a Day-Night Test to be played in Eden Gardens Kolkata, Joshi believes Bangladesh’s batsmen need to step up. </p>
      <p>The former Karnataka player having worked with the Bangladesh spinners has faith in them but believes that to put India under pressure the only way is to get runs on the board.</p>
      <p>"It's a strong Indian batting line-up. Recently, they have shown how ruthless they can be. To put India under pressure, first of all you need runs on the board. With Shakib (Al Hasan) and Tamim (Iqbal) not in the side, it won't be easy for Bangladesh, especially against an all-round Indian attack. Even at home, they don't rely only on spinners now. Look what their pacers did during the South Africa series," Joshi told TOI</p>
      <p>Joshi reckons that Bangladesh would also miss <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shakib_al_hasan">Shakib Al Hasan</a>, who has been banned by the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a> for a year, as a bowler who can change the game with his ability to bag wickets.</p>
      <p>"Shakib used to control the game and also pick wickets. It's a big loss for Bangladesh to miss such a talented player. Indian batsmen know how to play spin. It won't be easy against them.”</p>
