      <h1>Lionel Messi and Barcelona could shockingly hire the club’s dream manager</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:48:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author">Atharva Khadilkar</a></address>
      <h3>Barcelona may be massive winners from firing Ernesto Valverde if they are able to bring in the club’s most beloved managerial figure.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde is walking on thin ice and has reportedly got until the Catalans’ fixture versus Real Madrid on December 18 to save his job. Ahead of the big game, Barca have matches against Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid as well which could define their fate for the season’s end by a major lot.</p>
      <p>Valverde may not be Barca’s manager at the end of this season even if he manages to survive into the New Year, and the Blaugrana already have shortlisted a set of names. Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman leads the candidacy while River Plate boss Marcelo Gallardo is also among those in contention for the post.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1203768/Barcelona-Ernesto-Valverde-Lionel-Messi-news-La-Liga-Pep-Guardiola-Manchester-City"><b>Express has claimed</b></a> that the Spanish giants will look to land former manager Pep Guardiola from Manchester City. The former Bayern Munich boss is apparently unhappy with the Citizens after two years of unparalleled success on the domestic front and talking of his future some time ago, he said that he would return to the Camp Nou one day.</p>
      <blockquote>“I will return to Barcelona sooner or later. I’m trying to be a good coach; that hasn’t gone too badly in this decade. I will return to Barcelona to live, sooner or later.”</blockquote>
      <p>Lionel Messi is certainly thought to be in favour of Pep Guardiola’s re-appointment and there is no doubt that the 48 year old will be able to help Barca regain continental supremacy sooner or later. Moreover, the club also has an established and well balanced squad of youth and experience, providing Pep with a foundation for success.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola is a proven winner at the Camp Nou and delivered some of Barcelona’s most illustrious years as their manager between 2008 and 2012. Under his command, Barca won two Champions Leagues, three La Liga titles and one treble amongst them. With this team and a few more signings, the Spaniard may surely be able to replicate that kind of a winning run.</p>
      <p>Do you see Pep Guardiola returning to the Camp Nou’s helm and succeeding Ernesto Valverde?</p>
