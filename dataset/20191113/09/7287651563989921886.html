      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/5512"/>It seems Intel can not catch a break in regards to processor and platform vulnerabilities as researchers have found a new flaw in Intel processors — this time it’s a new variant of the Zombieload v2 attack they discovered earlier this year, but targeting Intel’s latest family of chips, Cascade Lake.</p>
      <p>The same team that helped uncover the infamous Spectre and Meltdown flaws say that a third issue, reported back in May under the name ZombieLoad, extends even further into the processor line than previously thought. The ZombieLoad hole can be exploited by malware running on a vulnerable machine, or a rogue logged-in user, to snoop on processor cores and extract sensitive information from memory that should be out of bounds. In practice, this would potentially allow an attacker already on the system to lift passwords, keys, and the like from other running software. TechCrunch on the matter:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Intel calls the vulnerability Transactional Asynchronous Abort, or TAA. It’s similar to the microarchitectural data sampling vulnerabilities that were the focus of earlier chip-based side-channel attacks, but TAA applies only to newer chips. </i>
        <i>The new variant of the Zombieload attack allows hackers with physical access to a device the ability to read occasionally sensitive data stored in the processor. The vulnerability is found in how the processor tries to predict the outcome of future commands. This technique, known as speculative execution, makes the processor run faster, but its flawed design makes it possible for attackers to extract potentially sensitive data.<br/></i>
        <i>Zombieload was discovered by the same researchers who found Meltdown and Spectre, a set of flaws that could be used to pick out secrets — like passwords — from the processor. It was believed later chip architectures, like Cascade Lake, were toughened against speculative execution attacks, while Intel rolled out software patches to reduce the attack surface.<br/></i>
        <i>Neither of the other vulnerabilities in the same family as Zombieload — notably Fallout and RIDL — work on Cascade Lake, they added. </i>
        <i>But the researchers said that Intel’s efforts to change the chip design in Cascade Lake are “not sufficient” to protect against these kinds of side-channel attacks. </i>
        <i>The same researchers warned Intel about the vulnerability in April — as it did with the other flaws they discovered that were patched a month later. Intel took until this month to investigate, the researchers said.<br/></i>
        <i>Intel released patches again for its vulnerable chips on Tuesday, acknowledging that its newest chips are vulnerable to the newest Zombieload variant. But the chip making giant recognizes that the mitigations “may not completely prevent the inference of data through a side channel using these techniques.”<br/></i>
        <i>The chip maker said there have been “no reports” of real-world exploits of the vulnerabilities.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Intel is releasing microcode (CPU firmware) updates today to address this new Zombieload attack variant, as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday -- known as <a href="https://blogs.intel.com/technology/2019/11/ipas-november-2019-intel-platform-update-ipu/">the Intel Platform Update (IPU) process</a>. A version of the <a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/zombieload.pdf">revised Zombieload whitepaper</a> will be made available on the <a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">Zombieload website</a> later today.  The same research team who found Zombieload v1 and v2, also found an issue with Intel's original patches for the four MDS attacks disclosed in May which will be disclosed in the same paper.</p>
