        <b>Alex Ambrose-coached Lionesses beat Subhash Chakraborty’s Panthers 3-0 in the opening fixture of the inaugural 4-team U-17 Women's Championship at the Kalyani Municipal Stadium on Monday. Lynda Kom Serto and Priyanka Sujeesh Pottekka scored for Lioness while the first goal was an own goal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a bid to select a strong squad for next year's FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup which India hosts, 4 teams are competing in the U-17 Championship at the Kalyani Municipal Stadium in West Bengal. In the opening fixture on Monday, Alex Ambrose's Lioness got the better of Subhash Chakraborty’s Panthers by three goals to nil.</p>
      <p>Lioness dominated most of the match and the young girls attacked Panther's post from the very beginning. The real chance came in the seventh minute when Lioness' Sunita Munda's shot missed the post by the barest of the margins.</p>
      <p>However, the Lioness found the mark on the 17th minute with Sunita Munda's shot getting deflected off Panthers’ captain Sudha Tirkey for an own goal. Panthers’ custodian Anjali Barke could not stop it.</p>
      <p>The Lionesses pressed more and missed a sitter in 26th minute, but Ambrose's girls scored the second goal in the 35th minute to ease off the pressure. Lynda Kom Serto was the goalscorer for Lioness.</p>
      <p>Panthers’ goalkeeper Anjali had a busy time in the second half as Lioness girls played a beautiful passing game. Priyanka Sujeesh Pottekka scored in the 73rd minute to seal the game for the Lioness.</p>
