      <p>Musician <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/moby">Moby</a> has shared his latest ink on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a>, revealing he has had the words “animal rights” tattooed down his arms.</p>
      <p>The producer and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AnimalRights">animal rights</a> activist explained in the post’s caption that he decided to get the bold <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Tattoo">tattoo</a> in commemoration of his 32nd year as a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vegan">vegan</a>.</p>
      <p>“As November is my 32 year vegan anniversary I thought I’d get a tattoo (well, technically 12 tattoos) to celebrate,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“I’m a vegan animal rights activist for many reasons, but ultimately because I believe at the core of my being that every animal has the right to live their own life, according to their own will.”</p>
      <p>The striking tattoos have sparked a very divisive reaction among Instagram users, some of which expressed their admiration for Moby and others their incredulity.</p>

      <p>“Love your music Moby and respect your views but this is overkill. Looks ridiculous,” one person commented underneath the post.</p>
      <p>“(As a vegan) Moby this looks stupid!” another wrote.</p>
      <p>“Love it!! Thank you for always speaking out for the animals,” a more praiseworthy Instagram user stated.</p>
      <p>“Animals are so lucky to have you making a difference daily,” commented animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/peta">Peta</a>).</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Moby revealed he’d had the words “Vegan For Life” <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/moby-vegan-for-life-tattoo-neck-kat-von-d-peta-animal-rights-a9110021.html">tattooed on the side of his neck</a>.</p>
      <p>The musician said that getting the tattoo “seemed like a pretty safe bet” considering he’d been a vegan for more than three decades.</p>
      <p>Both Moby’s vegan-inspired tattooed were inked by celebrity tattoo artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thekatvond/">Kat Von D</a>.</p>
      <p>The musician is a passionate animal rights activist, having previously <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=5795&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/moby-bags-drugs-having-sex-stranger-miranda-sawyer">described</a> his advocacy for animal rights his “day job”.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the singer sparked controversy when he alleged in his memoir that he briefly dated actor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NataliePortman">Natalie Portman</a> when she was 20, a claim that she denied.</p>
      <p>In a subsequent interview with <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a27528546/natalie-portman-interview-factory-farming-moby/"><i>Harper’s Bazaar UK</i></a>, Portman stated that Moby had acted in a “creepy” manner towards her when she “had just graduated high school”.</p>
      <p>Moby later issued a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/moby-natalie-portman-relationship-instagram-apology-book-then-it-fell-apart-a8930676.html">public apology</a> to Portman, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx4zzbEhxgU/?utm_source=ig_embed">stating</a>: “I hate that I might have caused her and her family distress”.</p>
