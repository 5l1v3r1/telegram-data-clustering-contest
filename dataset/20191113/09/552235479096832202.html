      <h1>St Mirren boss backs Celtic "machine" Lewis Morgan to shine for Scotland after surprise call-up</h1>
      <h2>The 23-year-old former Buddie has been called up for international duty despite a lack of game time for the Hoops.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:39:14+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Ramage</a></address>
      <p>St Mirren manager Jim Goodwin has backed former Buddies star Lewis Morgan to shine for Scotland after his surprise call-up to the squad.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has struggled for game time at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> this season, but has been drafted in for his country after Steve Clarke was hit with a spate of call-offs.</p>
      <p>Goodwin, who played alongside Morgan when he first broke into the Saints side, says he will be fit and ready to compete in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> ’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Cyprus on Saturday despite a lack of match sharpness – because he is simply a “machine”.</p>
      <p>“It’s brilliant for Lewis to get called up,” Goodwin told Express Sport.</p>
      <p>“He came on against us a few weeks ago and physically I can see the difference in him.</p>
      <p>“He’s really filled out, he’s obviously been working out in the gym a lot.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Athletically, we know what he’s capable of. He’s an absolute machine getting up and down the park.</p>
      <p>“ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> can see the attributes he has. He clearly feels he’s fit enough to take part and he is a fantastic player.</p>
      <p>“Lewis is very level-headed and I don’t think the stresses and strains of Scotland will faze him in the slightest.</p>
      <p>“I think he’ll enjoy that pressure.”</p>
      <p>After sealing his move to Celtic in January last year, Morgan was immediately loaned back to the Saints and scored five goals as he helped them to lift the Championship title.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>While he has had to wait patiently to make his breakthrough with the Parkhead side, Goodwin revealed he doesn’t begrudge him his move but warned there is a price to pay for moving to either of the Glasgow giants.</p>
      <p>Goodwin said: “He’s probably unfortunate with the lack of game time he’s had. That’s the only thing I’d be wary of with him going forward. He needs to play more regularly.</p>
      <p>“He earned the right to go to a club the size of Celtic. To get the nice contract and be working with top-class players, top coaches and great facilities.</p>
      <p>“But there comes a time when you have to play regular first-team football.</p>
      <p>“With the squads at both the Old Firm teams so big, it’s difficult for these young guys to get a chance that they need.</p>
      <p>“He’s been patient and we wish him all the best and hope he gets his chance for club and country.”</p>
