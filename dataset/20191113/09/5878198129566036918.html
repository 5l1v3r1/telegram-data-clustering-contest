      <p>It took her two years to re-gain her freedom from the shackles of darkness and seclusion.</p>
      <p>Her only crime was visiting her ex-husband. Hassana Sale, a mother of four, was locked up in a dark room at her family residence to prevent her from returning to her estranged husband.</p>
      <p>The Kaduna State Police Command and Arida Relief Foundation, a non-governmental organization in Northern Nigeria rescued Sale, who was locked up in a dark room by her own brother for two years.</p>
      <p>She was reportedly locked up following her visits to her ex-husband in a bid to see her children. Her family decided to lock her up upon realizing her persistent visits to her divorced husband.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/2019/11/woman-locked-up-in-a-dark-room-for-2-years-freed-by-the-police-in-kaduna-state-2.html">reports,</a> Sale was found in a wretched state in the room where she was locked up at Rigasa area of Kaduna by her brother Lawal Sale, who never wanted her to go back to her ex-husband who divorced her.  </p>
      <p>According to the founder of the NGO, Hajiya Rabi Salisu, Sale became depressed after she got divorced but always visited her matrimonial home to see her four children.</p>
      <p>“She visits the children on daily basis, so the elder brother and some of her relatives decided to lock her up in a dark room for two years so that she will not go back to her ex-husband.”</p>
      <p>Hassana Sale is currently receiving medical attention while Lawal Sale is in police custody.</p>
      <p>“We have taken her to the hospital and when she becomes stable, she would be handed over to the state Ministry of Human Service and Social Development to pursue the matter,” Salisu said.</p>
