      <p><b>KISUMU, Kenya, Nov 13</b> <b>– A team of Principal Secretaries on Tuesday toured the Kisumu Port to oversee the rehabilitation works as the facility awaits official opening by President Uhuru Kenyatta.</b></p>

      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“The reason why we are bringing the high-powered delegation here is obviously to demonstrate the value of Kisumu port and the investment the government is putting here,” Maringa said.</p>
      <p>He the government is determined to ensure the port is up and running to spur economic growth with the lake basin region.</p>
      <p>Maringa noted Lake Victoria is key for the country to trade with partner states thus the amount of investment pumped into the revitalization of the port.</p>
      <p>“Lake Victoria is a connector for East African Countries, its economic potential is tremendous,” he said.</p>
      <p>The PS said the lake will offer the best opportunities for the blue economy and the government is keen on harnessing every opportunity that exists with the lake.</p>
      <p>“Kenya is determined not only to exploited but lead as EAC to make sure that the lake becomes a viable resourceful for our country,” he said.</p>
      <p>Maringa’s delegation was accompanied by a technical team which investigated all aspects within the port to be able to make a conclusive report that will be presented to President Kenyatta.</p>
      <p>“As you can see, we came with technical people, the purpose is to insect the rehabilitation of the port in every detail,” he said.</p>
      <p>Maringa said the team will concentrate on the port operations that include, supply and evacuation of oil and export of oil, road networks to the port and lighting amongst other issues.</p>
      <p>“The information we gather today should be able to identify any gaps or stumbling blocks that we see outstanding so that when we go back, we deliberate on how to block such,” he said.</p>
      <p>The PS was non-committal as to when President Kenyatta is expected to officially launch the port that has been christened the ‘Handshake Port’.</p>
      <p>Once operational, PS Maringa said the Kisumu Port will facilitate trade with ports like Bukoba, Mwanza, and Jinja in the East African region.</p>
      <p>Under the Ministry of EAC, Maringa said there has been a lot of engagement among the EAC to make the ports viable through trade.</p>
      <p>“Kisumu Port will be the beneficiary of a lot of trade that will be passing through our port, for example, the oil,” he said.</p>
