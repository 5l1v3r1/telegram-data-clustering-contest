      <p>In previous seasons, Ivan Rakitic was one of the Blaugrana's most relied-upon players, but his time as one of the first names on the teamsheet appear to be over.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has played just 255 minutes of football in this campaign so far, with manager Ernesto Valverde preferring the likes of Arthur, Arturo Vidal, Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets to him in midfield.</p>
      <p>Asked in a recent interview about how things have gone for him this season, Rakitic likened his situation to a child having their favourite toy taken away from them.</p>
      <p>"How can I enjoy myself? Playing football. Playing football," he told <i>Universo Valdano.</i></p>
      <p>"How does my youngest daughter feel if I take her toy from her? She's sad.</p>
      <p>"I feel the same: they have taken the ball from me and I am sad."</p>

      <p>However, the Croatian also explained that he respects Valverde's decision.</p>
      <p>"I understand and respect the decisions made by the coach (Ernesto Valverde) and the club, but I think I've given a lot in the last five and a bit years here, and the only thing I want is to be able to keep enjoying myself.</p>
      <p>"That's the most important thing for me."</p>
