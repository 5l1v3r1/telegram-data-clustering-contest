      <p><b>Animal Collective</b>‘s modern psych-pop classic <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> turned 10 this year, and the band is celebrating the anniversary with the new live album <i>Ballet Slippers</i>, which includes live recordings from various shows on the 2009 <i>MPP</i> tour, “sequenced to reflect a full concert experience, complete with song transitions and interludes.” Like those shows, it’s heavy on <i>MPP</i> songs but includes a few older faves as well.</p>
      <p>“It’s impossible for us to remember the years around <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> without thinking about the live experience,” the band says. “As the record turns 10, there has been a lot of talk about the album itself, but so much of the time living with those songs was spent on stage together. Every night on tour, the music opened up again, leaving us new spaces to fill and new opportunities to rethink our past. Just as <i>Merriweather</i> documents the era in one of its forms, we wanted <i>Ballet Slippers</i> to do the same for some of its other forms.”</p>
      <p>The album was mixed by Ajay Saggar and edited by Panda Bear, and it comes out digitally and on 3xLP vinyl next week (11/22). You can pre-order it <a href="https://animalcollective.dominomart.com/ballet-slippers-3xlp">here</a> and check out the full tracklist below.</p>
