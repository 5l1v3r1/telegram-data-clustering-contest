      <p>A Massachusetts firefighter and father of three died while rescuing members of his crew at the scene of a 4-alarm blaze overnight, officials said.</p>
      <p>The massive fire in Worcester, about 45 miles west of Boston, was reported just before 1 a.m. on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Lt. Jason Menard, a member of the Worcester Fire Department since 2010, died rescuing the other members of his crew, officials said.</p>

      <p>Menard's family had planned to be leaving for a trip to Disney, said Michael Papagni, president of the local firefighters' union.</p>
      <p>"They're now instead planning a hero's send off," Papagni told reporters Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Menard and the other firefighters were working to rescue a resident and baby when they became trapped by heavy fire conditions, Worcester Fire Chief Michael Lavoie said.</p>

      <p>Menard "heroically and selflessly saved his crew, helping a probationary firefighter to the stairs and then returning to rescue another trapped firefighter, assisting him out the window," Lavoie said at a news conference.</p>
      <p>Fire conditions then overtook the third floor and Menard "was unable to escape," Lavoie said.</p>

      <p>The high winds and brutally cold temperature made it difficult for the fallen lieutenant to be rescued, officials said.</p>
      <p>Three other firefighters were injured while battling the blaze. One remains in the hospital in serious but stable condition and the other two firefighters have been released.</p>

      <p>Menard leaves behind his wife, three children and parents, the department said.</p>
      <p>"He had a true passion for the job and he'll be missed," Papagni added.</p>
