      <p><b>PHOENIX – </b>Anthony Davis had 24 points and 12 rebounds, Kyle Kuzma added 23 points and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Phoenix Suns 123-115 on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The Lakers (8-2) are off to their best 10-game start since 2010 and bounced back from a home loss to Toronto on Sunday. LeBron James added 19 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds.</p>
      <p>Phoenix (6-4) trailed for a big chunk of the fourth quarter but pushed ahead 113-111 on Devin Booker’s fast-break layup with 3:29 left. The Lakers responded with three straight 3-pointers — one from James and two more from Kuzma — to lead 120-113 and put the game out of reach.</p>
      <p>The Suns were led by Ricky Rubio and Booker, who both scored 21 points.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hawks 125, Nuggets 121</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Denver, Trae Young scored 15 of his season-high 42 points in the fourth quarter and added 11 assists to lead Atlanta past Denver.</p>
      <p>Young finished seven points shy of his career high set March 1 against Chicago last season. He was 13 of 21 from the field and finished 8 for 13 on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>Jabari Parker had 20 points and nine rebounds, and Alex Len scored 17 for the Hawks.</p>
      <p>Will Barton led Denver with 21 points, Jokic had 20 and Paul Millsap added 19.</p>
      <p>
        <b>76ers 98, Cavaliers 97</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Philadelphia, Joel Embiid scored 27 points, including the go-ahead dunk with 13.2 seconds remaining, as Philadelphia eked out a win over Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Josh Richardson added 17 points and Ben Simmons had 15 for Philadelphia, which won despite missing 30 of 38 3-point attempts.</p>
      <p>Jordan Clarkson and Kevin Love each had 20 points to pace Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 18 points.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bulls 120, Knicks 102</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Chicago, Coby White made a franchise-record seven 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, and Chicago pulled away from slumping New York.</p>
      <p>White missed his first five shots from the field and began the final period with just four points. But the rookie guard put on a dazzling show down the stretch.</p>
      <p>White finished with 27 points. Zach LaVine had 25 for Chicago, and Wendell Carter Jr. finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
      <p>New York lost for the sixth time in seven games. Marcus Morris scored 22 points for the Knicks, and RJ Barrett finished with 21 points and nine assists.</p>
