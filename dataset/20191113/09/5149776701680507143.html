      <h1>Leaked report says HS2 should go ahead despite rising costs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:22:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Lancefield, David Whitfield</a></address>
      <p>A leaked report says that the HS2 high-speed railway should go ahead despite the cost rising by £32bn and being likely to increase further.</p>
      <p>The leaked early draft of a report seen by The Times stated that it should be built - because "large ticket price rises" will be needed to discourage peak-time travel if it is not.</p>
      <p>The review, led by former HS2 Ltd chairman Douglas Oakervee, found that HS2 could boost cities in the North and Midlands more than London due to better connections on intercity routes.</p>
      <p>It also claimed there are no "shovel-ready" alternative schemes to raise capacity on the existing railway.</p>
      <p>One section of HS2 is earmarked to come through Nottinghamshire, pass through Long Eaton just over the Derbyshire border and with a hub near Toton.</p>
      <p>HS2 was allocated £56 billion in 2015. Its latest cost estimate of £88 billion is expected to increase further.</p>
      <p>The review calculated that rising costs have slashed the estimated benefit to taxpayers for every £1 spent from £2.30 in 2017 to as little as £1.30 this year, The Times reported.</p>
      <p>The review was launched by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in August.</p>
      <p>It was due to be completed this autumn, but had not been finalised before the General Election was called. Its findings will be delivered to the new government.</p>

      <p>Phase 1 of HS2 is planned to run between London and Birmingham.</p>
      <p>It was initially planned to launch in 2026, but a recent report by HS2 Ltd stated that this could be pushed back until 2031.</p>
      <p>Current designs involve a second Y-shaped phase launching in two stages: Phase 2a from the West Midlands to Crewe followed by phase 2b from Crewe to Manchester, and Birmingham to Leeds (including a section through Nottinghamshire).</p>
      <p>The Nottinghamshire spur was expected to open in 2033, but is now more likely to between 2035 and 2040.</p>
      <p>Connecting Britain, a coalition of business and cross-party political leaders, welcomed the findings, while insisting that Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) - a plan to transform train services across the region - must be delivered at the same time as HS2.</p>
