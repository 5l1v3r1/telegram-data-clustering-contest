      <h2>Arthur has been lashing out of late</h2>

      <p>Arthur Thomas lashed out in anger at Archie Sharma last night, and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> fans were left horrified by his behaviour.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night (November 12), Arthur blamed Archie for 'ruining' his dad's birthday and turned nasty towards the young boy - punching him and knocking him to the floor.</p>

      <p>In a disturbing sequence of events, Archie was knocked unconscious and left lifeless on the floor of the kitchen.</p>
      <p>The nasty altercation came after Arthur told him no one missed his mum Rachel now that she was dead.</p>
      <p>He made it clear he hadn't been welcome to the picnic for Ashley's birthday, before lashing out with his fists.</p>

      <p>When Laurel and Jai found poor Archie on the floor, Arthur told them he'd fell by accident.</p>
      <p>But later, Jai and Laurel found more bruises on him.</p>

      <p>However, when they questioned Archie about how he got the marks, Arthur blurted out that Jimmy King was to blame!</p>

      <p>While some viewers <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-worried-arthur-thomas-is-becoming-a-bully/">branded Arthur a "demon child"</a>, others insisted blaming the boy was too easy, and suggested he needs help with his anger issues.</p>
      <p>Ever since <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoiler-jais-son-makes-a-shock-return-to-the-village-as-rachel-dies/">Archie appeared in the Dales</a>, Arthur has clearly been jealous of the attention he has been getting from Laurel.</p>
      <p>But blaming Jimmy was a step too far for some of those watching from home, who claim he could never hurt a fly.</p>
      <p>One of the Arthur haters tweeted: "Whoa Arthur! Really becoming a little demon child now!"</p>

      <p>Another said: "Poor little Archie... Arthur's a bully."</p>
      <p>A third added: "Never liked Arthur, but he has completely gone off the rails, horrible little boy."</p>
      <p>"Ashley will be turning in his grave at Arthur, what has happened to him? Vile child," blasted another.</p>
      <p>However, some fans were more sympathetic, with one tweeting: "Arthur isn't vile. What Arthur is doing to Archie is awful and blaming Jimmy for it terrible. If you listen to what Arthur says to Archie, to me it explains a lot.</p>
      <p>"Arthur needs someone to recognise that he needs attention and understanding. I'm not excusing bullying, far from it."</p>

      <p>Another said: "I wish someone would recognise what Arthur is going through #Emmerdale."</p>
      <p>A third added: "Oh this Arthur and Archie stuff is sad. These two boys are great little actors."</p>
      <p>"Laurel is so insensitive," said one more. "Why did she go back on her promise for it just to be her and her two kids that day? Why did she ruin something so special for Arthur?"</p>
      <p>Many others were livid that this is the start of an upsetting child abuse storyline for Jimmy, with one typing: "Jimmy getting this child abuse storyline. Why do bad things happen to good people? Gonna be hard to watch, hopefully people will believe him #Emmerdale."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Poor Jimmy getting the blame."</p>
      <p>A third added: "What the hell? Arthur blamed someone like Jimmy, who couldn't even hurt a fly."</p>
      <p>"If they honestly believe Jimmy would hurt a child, they need their heads' read," lamented another.</p>
