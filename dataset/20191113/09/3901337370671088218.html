      <p>Bafana Bafana head coach, Molefi Ntseki revealed that once the plans are in action to have scouts overseas, Benni McCarthy will be considered for the job.</p>
      <p>The Bafana legend recently parted ways with Cape Town City after just over two seasons at the helm of the club.</p>
      <p>Now as McCarthy looks for the next step in his professional career, there has been talk about whether or not he has a future at the South African national team as possibly a scout abroad.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the program, the plan that I have presented to the president and technical committee, we need to have a scout overseas. Basically we are saying that we must have two, they will help each other for the senior players and for all the junior players because if we are to have one scout overseas, it will be very difficult for them to be all over and give us a technical report of the players that we have overseas,” Ntseki told the media.</p>
      <p>“It is just unfortunate that Coach Benni had to lose his job at Cape Town City but I think that doesn’t mean anything bad about him, he’s a good coach, he’s a legend of the game and he is qualified to do the job for us. When that time comes, we will be able to consider him,” he added.</p>
