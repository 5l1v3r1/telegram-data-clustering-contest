      <h1>No let-up in Saracens' recruitment as utility South African forward is lined-up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:20:53+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>With the cash-strapped <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers">Stormers</a> continuing to struggle to hold onto all their high-profile stars, it has now been revealed that talented young utility forward <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/cobus-wiese/">Cobus Wiese</a> is in advanced negotiations with Premiership giants <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> to sign a five-year deal with the European champions – which would see him qualify to play for England.</p>
      <p><a href="https://rugby365.com/tournaments/super-rugby/news-super-rugby/stormers-star-joins-euro-exodus">His imminent departure</a> comes at a time when Stormers management is struggling with dwindling cash resources and ongoing boardroom battles. The 22-years-old giant has been a regular in the Stormers and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/western-province">Western Province</a> teams for the last two years.</p>
      <p>The deal seems set to go ahead, despite <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/baxter-hits-full-truth-mode-after-saracens-no-show-at-epcr-launch/">the salary cap saga</a> that has enveloped the London outfit in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>His departure will be the latest in a mass exodus of top stars – which includes World Cup-winning Springboks <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/eben-etzebeth/">Eben Etzebeth</a> (to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulon">Toulon</a> in France) and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/damian-de-allende/">Damian de Allende</a> (to Wild Knights in Japan), as well as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/dan-kriel/">Dan Kriel</a> (Lions), <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/corne-fourie/">Corne Fourie</a> (Gloucester, England), <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/sikhumbuzo-notshe/">Sikhumbuzo Notshe</a> (Sharks), <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/michael-kumbirai/">Michael Kumbirai</a> (Sharks), Chris Massyn (Cheetahs), Kobus van Dyk (Eagles, Japan), <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/craig-barry/">Craig Barry</a> (Cheetahs) and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/ew-viljoen/">EW Viljoen</a> (Leicester Tigers, England).</p>
      <p>The revelation of another high-profile departure comes against the background of the ongoing cash-crunch at Newlands. It is believed that basics such as strapping and water for players are running low, although officials are reluctant to talk about the franchise’s financial status.</p>

      <p>It appears the negotiations surrounding the redevelopment (or sale) of the Newlands stadium and the planned move to the Cape Town stadium have hit some snags in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The deal with an investment bank for the redevelopment of Newlands may not be the proverbial ‘goose that lays golden eggs’.</p>
      <p>Negotiations with the city council for the move to the Greenpoint venue are also not progressing as smoothly as Western Province Rugby Football Union officials want.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Stormers’ pre-season preparations are stuttering along – given that several players are on loan to teams abroad and none of the World Cup-winning Boks will be available till mid-December.</p>
      <p>Captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/siya-kolisi/">Siya Kolisi</a>, Bongi Mbonambi, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/steven-kitshoff/">Steven Kitshoff</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/frans-malherbe/">Frans Malherbe</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/pieter-steph-du-toit/">Pieter-Steph du Toit</a> and Herschel Jantjies will all take a well-deserved break. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/damian-willemse/">Damian Willemse</a> is still on loan to Saracens.</p>
