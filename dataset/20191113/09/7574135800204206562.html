      <p>Irish singer and songwriter <b>Aoife Nessa Frances</b> is releasing her debut album, <i><a href="https://grapefruitrecordclub.com/products?keywords=aoife">Land of No Junction</a></i>, on January 17 via Ba Da Bing Records. “The album title is a result of a mishearing,” Aoife says. “Cian Nugent [Aoife’s musical collaborator and co-producer] was telling me about childhood trips he made to Llandudno in Wales, passing through a station called Llandudno Junction… Land of No Junction later became a place in itself. A liminal space – a dark vast landscape to visit in dreams… A place of waiting where I could sit with uncertainty and accept it. Rejecting the distinct and welcoming the uncertain and the unknown.” You can see the cover art and tracklisting below.</p>
      <p>We’ve already heard one single from the album, <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/21-new-songs-out-today-15/">“Blow Up,”</a> and today we’re premiering a second, “Here in the Dark,” which you can watch the video for below. It’s another mellow track full of dreamy psychedelic touches and a yearning closing string passage, well-complimented by Aoife’s dulcet voice. “‘Here in the Dark’ is a song about forgiveness and the fragility of love,” she says, “making mistakes and owning up to them.” Aoife directed the video, which features archival footage found by Ralph Sheridan of the 1939 New York Worlds Fair parade.</p>
