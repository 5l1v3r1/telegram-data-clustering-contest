      <h3>SENATOR Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go told media during the signing of the Manifesto of Support to the anti-corruption campaign of the government that President Rodrigo Duterte will continue to work and perform his official functions while taking a rest in Davao City.</h3>
      <p>“Ok po ang Pangulo. Sa totoo lang, hindi po napapansin noon na, in a month, meron talaga siyang Mindanao leg na ginagawa. Isang linggo siya doon, nag-ikot sa Jolo, sa mga kampo. Binisita niya ang mga sugatan na sundalo. Hindi niyo alam, naroon siya, nagtatrabaho,” Go said.  </p>
      <p>He added, “Sa totoo lang, ayaw ni Pangulo na nagpapahinga kahit ina-advise siya ng doktor. ‘Di siya makatagal sa bahay. Gusto n’ya magtrabaho. Bahay n’ya sa Davao, doon ang comfort zone n’ya. Doon siya nakakapagpahinga at nagtatrabaho. But, rest assured, he is ok.”</p>
      <p>Go said that the President’s rest, which was supposed to start on Monday, was stalled by his meeting in Manila with Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) Chairman Nur Misuari to discuss the creation of a Peace Coordinating Committee between the organization and the government.</p>
      <p>“Dapat nag-umpisa pa noong Lunes na nasa Davao siya. He cut it by one day dahil may usapan sila ni Nur Misuari for the creation of a Peace Coordinating Committee between MNLF and the government of the Philippines,” said Go, adding that another meeting is set in December which would include concerned government and MNLF officials.</p>
      <p>“Magkakaroon ng another meeting. Palitan, Manila tapos Davao and even Zamboanga. Kung saan convenient for both parties na pwede sila mag-usap,” Go said.</p>
      <p>“Sa December 6, may bagong meeting along with MNLF officials. On the part of the government, kasama na ang National Security Adviser, Department of Justice at Department of Foreign Affairs. Pinapatawag din ng Pangulo ‘yung dating kasamahan na lumagda sa peace agreement with Nur Misuari,” he added.  </p>
      <p>Asked how long the President’s rest will be, Go said that he will stay in Davao until Thursday, added that he and the President are scheduled to visit  farmers in North Cotabato on Friday to listen to their concerns.</p>
      <p>“Biyernes, punta kami ng North Cotabato sa mga farmers. Nanawagan sila sa Pangulo kaya ang sabi naman ng Pangulo, pupuntahan niya sila. Siya mismo ang pupunta at makikinig sa mga farmer. Kita niyo naman, trabaho pa rin,” Go said.</p>
