      <h2>Notts will now look for a new top order batsman following the 26-year-old's departure</h2>

      <p>Batsman Jake Libby has joined Worcestershire, ending a five-year association with Nottinghamshire by mutual consent.</p>
      <p>Head coach Peter Moores thanked the 26-year-old for his whole-hearted commitment to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-ccc">Notts</a></p>
      <p>“Jake has been a valued member of our setup and someone who has worked tirelessly on his game throughout his time at Trent Bridge,” said Moores.</p>
      <p>“There’s been some exceptional performances to remember and some tough times as well. He’s remained very positive throughout; always a pleasure to coach and to have around the group.</p>
      <p>“Jake’s white-ball cricket has improved a lot and that’s credit to him. Meanwhile, he’s found himself missing out more often in four-day cricket.</p>
      <p>“With Jake having expressed a desire to join Worcestershire, we have agreed for him to leave and we wish him all the best with the next chapter.</p>
      <p>“It creates a place in the squad for another top-order batsman, to which we’ll look to recruit with red-ball cricket primarily in mind.”</p>
      <p>Libby, a right-handed batsman and occasional off-spinner, has made 75 appearances for Nottinghamshire across all formats since making his debut in 2014.</p>
      <p>“I’ve hugely enjoyed my time with at Trent Bridge and will forever be grateful for the opportunities I’ve had to prove myself as a professional cricketer,” said the Cornishman.</p>
      <p>“Working with the coaching staff and alongside the calibre of batsmen at Notts has definitely allowed me to progress and mature as a cricketer.</p>
      <p>“I’ve also relished the chances I’ve been given in the past couple of seasons to develop my limited-overs game.</p>
      <p>“After five years with Notts, I feel the time is right to move into a new phase of my career and take on a fresh challenge.”</p>
