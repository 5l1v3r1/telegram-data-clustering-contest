      <h1>Announcing Windows Community Toolkit v6.0</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael A. Hawker</a></address>
      <p>We’re thrilled to announce today the next update to the <b>Windows Community Toolkit, version 6.0</b>, made possible with help and contributions from our developer community. This release brings ARM64 support to the toolkit as well as an update to XAML Islands for .NET Core 3 support. In addition, we have new features like the EyeDropper control and new Win32 notification helpers. We also have an update to our preview of Microsoft Graph enabled XAML controls.</p>
      <p>See more details on these features below.</p>
      <h3>XAML Islands brings UWP to WPF, WinForms, and Win32</h3>
      <p>XAML Islands enables a developer to enhance the look, feel, and functionality of an existing WPF, Windows Forms, or C++ Win32 application and make use of the latest Windows 10 UI features that are only available via UWP controls like inking:</p>

      <p>This release improves tooling support for .NET Core 3 and makes it even easier to get started.</p>

      <h3>ARM64 Support</h3>
      <p>The Windows Community Toolkit now supports applications that are targeting ARM64. This allows developers’ apps to take advantage of increased performance and battery life by running on the native architecture for devices like the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc">Surface Pro X</a>. We also worked closely with the <a href="http://aka.ms/Win2D">Win2D</a> team to ensure it also now supports ARM64. This was important for <a href="https://aka.ms/Lottie">Lottie</a> and other toolkit features that rely on Win2D.</p>
      <h3>Lottie Animation Improvements</h3>
      <p>This update brings more Adobe After Effects features to Lottie-Windows, including Linear and Radial Gradients, Masks, Track Mattes, and codegen support for Image Layers. We hope that these additions will allow motion designers and application developers to create even more visually compelling user experiences on Windows 10. Since some of these features rely on newer SDKs, Lottie-Windows now also offers adaptive versioning. We rely on the community to prioritize feature work so please do keep providing your valuable feedback and suggestions for Lottie-Windows <a href="https://aka.ms/lottie">here</a>!</p>
      <h3>Eye Dropper</h3>
      <p>The new Eye Dropper control allows you to provide effortless color selection functionality to your app.</p>

      <h3>XAML Graph Controls Preview</h3>
      <p>This new addition to the Windows Community Toolkit allows developers to easily authenticate and access <a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Graph</a> in Windows 10 apps to create rich data and user connected experiences. These controls are available as a preview of our 6.1 release today and will work with UWP apps and in WPF/WinForms for Win32 apps via XAML Islands on .NET Core 3. In addition, with the help of Xamarin and the <a href="https://platform.uno/">Uno Platform</a>, you will also soon be able to use them on Android and iOS.</p>
