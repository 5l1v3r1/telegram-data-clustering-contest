      <h1>Nando’s customers can get free food all month - just by using their phone</h1>
      <h2>And, remarkably, all you need to do is show the Nando's till assistant that your phone’s predictive text shortlists “Nando’s” when you type in the words “I’m craving”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:38:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>We all love a cheeky Nando's - be it macho peas, creamy mash and half a chicken, or a halloumi and mushroom wrap.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese inspired eatery has multiple outlets across Birmingham, the Black Country and throughout the wider Midlands region.</p>
      <p>And Nando's, which is widely loved by chicken lovers, is giving you the chance to get a free meal.</p>
      <p>Customers can get a free Nando's meal every week this month.</p>
      <p>And, remarkably, all you need to do is show the Nando's till assistant that your phone’s predictive text shortlists “Nando’s” when you type in the words “I’m craving”.</p>
