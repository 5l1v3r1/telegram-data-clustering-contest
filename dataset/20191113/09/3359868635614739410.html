      <p>An American multinational technology company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/">Apple</a> is on the threshold of presenting a new product. The company is going to introduce a new version of the MacBook Pro laptop. As Apple has said, the new laptop will be greatly improved.</p>

      <p>Firstly, MacBook Pro moves from a 15-inch screen. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro will have the largest screen of any MacBook Pro since Apple suspended producing the 17-inch model back in 2012.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the keyboard in a new model is more reliable than the previous MacBooks’ butterfly-mechanism keyboards that made users complain about stuck keys, repeated keystrokes, and other issues.</p>
      <p>Besides, the new model’s display will definitely appeal to those working with graphic arts and colors: video and photo editors, gamers and software developers.</p>
      <p>As far as the price is considered, Apple promises the new MacBook Pro will cost about the same as the 15-inch model that starts at $2,399 and rises to above $6,000 when upgrading the specs. Those familiar with the matter said that the laptop will be available for purchase this week.</p>
      <p>In December, Apple is planning to introduce a new Mac Pro desktop computer, which will finish a year of Apple product releases that also included the iPhone 11 line, Apple Watch Series 5 and AirPods Pro.</p>
      <p>This year, Apple has impressed its customers with a number of products and developments. Recently, Apple <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-airpods-pro/">introduced</a> AirPods Pro, wireless earbuds that feature active noise cancellation and promise perfect sounding. The upgraded AirPods Pro are equipped with an outward-facing microphone that detects external sound and makes the earbuds extremely useful while sitting in airplanes.</p>
      <p>The company has also exulted after reviewing its financial data. In October, Apple <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-highest-q4-revenue/">published</a> an official report with its earnings for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year which ended on September 28, 2019. While the corporation’s rivals were taking unholy joy in declining Mac and iPhone sales, Apple managed to benefit from other parts of its business and receive great gains.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Apple pulled in total revenue of $64 billion in the fourth quarter, a year over year increase of 2% from the same period in 2018, also surpassing the expectation set at $62.99 billion.</p>
      <p>Soon, the company is set to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-tv-november/">launch</a> Apple TV+ and compete with Amazon, Netflix, Disney, and AT&amp;T-owned HBO. Currently, the tech giant is also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-ar-headset-glasses/">working</a> on a new product line. It includes AR Glasses that will feature a high-resolution display for information broadcasting as well as blending virtual objects with the real world and augmented reality headsets that are expected to be introduced in 2022.</p>
