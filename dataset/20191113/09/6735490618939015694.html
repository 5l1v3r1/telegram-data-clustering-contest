      <p>“Of course I wouldn’t do it now because there would be real people able to do it,” Turner responded.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her decision to take the role, Turner said, “I thought, <i>Okay, a woman playing a man playing a woman. I haven’t done that</i>. So I said yes.”</p>

      <p>During a question speed-round, Turner was also asked about her worst on-screen kiss.</p>
      <p>“Oh, that’d have to be Burt Reynolds,” she said, recalling the film “Switching Channels”.</p>
      <p>As it turned out, she originally was supposed to star in the film opposite Michael Caine, but he got stuck on the set of “Jaws: The Revenge” and was replaced by Reynolds.</p>

      <p>In the after-show, Turner revealed that she turned down the starring role in the 1985 film “King Solomon’s Mine” because the script was “terrible.”</p>
      <p>Her agent had phoned her about the role and she responded, “Just tell them I want $5 million,” as a way of gracefully turning down the offer.</p>
      <p>“There was this pause and he went, ‘Well, they started there,'” Turner said, explaining that she was then forced to simply turn down the role outright. Even her fiancé at the time couldn’t believe what he’d overheard.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, but the film sucks,” she told him at the time, “and I was right.”</p>
