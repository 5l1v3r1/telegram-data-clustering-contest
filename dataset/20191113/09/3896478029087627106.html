      <p>The Hadad family of the southern town of Netivot had a narrow escape Tuesday when their home sustained a direct hit by a rocket from nearby Gaza. Thanks to the family's vigilance, no one was hurt in the attack.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of rockets have been fired at Israeli communities as far north as Tel Aviv since Tuesday morning, after the targeted killing of Islamic Jihad commander Baha Abu al-Atta in a predawn IDF airstrike in the Gaza Strip.</p>

      <p>"As soon as we came out, I saw a hole in the kitchen ceiling and another in the dining room. It's like a volcano erupted inside our house," Batsheva says, adding that she could not stop crying from the shock.</p>

      <p>The Hadads' neighbor Na'ama Davidi says two sirens went off in quick succession.</p>
      <p>"I did not make it to safety on the first, but did reach the protected area as the second siren blared," she says.</p>

      <p>"I saw flames from my window and I was sure my house was hit," she says.</p>
      <p>"My message to everyone is to take all necessary precautions and run to the protected areas. I used to be complacent too, but not anymore."</p>
