        <b>A suspected suicide bombing outside police headquarters in Indonesia's city of Medan in North Sumatra killed the perpetrator and wounded some officers on Wednesday, police said, just a month after an attack on a former security minister.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The motive for Wednesday's attack was not immediately clear, but Indonesia, the worldâ€™s most populous Muslim-majority country, has suffered a resurgence in homegrown militancy in recent years, with some attacks targeting police.</p>
      <p>The suspected suicide bomber had died in the attack, a spokesman for the North Sumatra police, Tatan Dirsan Atmaja, said by telephone, adding that some police officers were wounded in the blast at 8:40 am (0140 GMT).</p>
      <p>Television broadcast images of people rushing out of buildings around the headquarters.</p>
      <p>National police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo said the blast happened in a car park near an area where people were queuing for clearance letters from police.</p>
      <p>"We're on alert right now," Prasetyo told Kompas TV. "The explosion didn't reach the centre for the clearance letter service, it was just in a parking lot."</p>
      <p>In recent years, Islamic radicals, some tied to the Islamic State-inspired militant group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), have targeted police in a series of attacks.</p>
      <p>The latest attack comes a month after a suspected Islamist stabbed and wounded Wiranto, Indonesia's former security minister, who uses one name.</p>
