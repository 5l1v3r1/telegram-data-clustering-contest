        <b>UK inflation rose at its lowest pace in almost three years last month as the energy cap kept a lid on the price of electricity, gas and other fuels, according to official statistics.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose 1.5% in October, compared with 1.7% in September.</p>
      <p>Energy regulator Ofgem lowered price caps last month.</p>
      <p>The slower pace of price rises could boost household spending as wages are rising faster than inflation.</p>
