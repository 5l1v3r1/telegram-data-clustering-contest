      <p>Flying Saints winger Kyle Magennis faces a race against time to be fit for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> ’s crunch clash with Ross County.</p>
      <p>The talented stand-in skipper picked up an ankle knock towards the end of Saturday’s 5-2 defeat to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> , meaning he has had to withdraw from the Scotland Under-21 side.</p>
      <p>He now has the international break to recover in time for the Buddies home match with the Staggies, as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Jim Goodwin</a> ’s men aim to hoist themselves off the bottom of the Premiership table.</p>
      <p>Gaffer Goodwin said: “Unfortunately, Kyle took a knock at the end of the Hearts game.</p>
      <p>“He’s got swelling on his ankle so he’s been unable to train this week and link up with Scotland either.</p>
      <p>“It’s a real disappointment for Kyle because he really enjoys meeting up with the the national team.</p>
      <p>“It’s always nice that he gets recognised for his performances for us and the international team will be disappointed he’s not available.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, he’ll recover in time for our next game against Ross County.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>While Goodwin feels for his 21-year-old star, he also believes the break might be a blessing in disguise after experiencing a heavy workload already this campaign.</p>
      <p>Magennis has played almost every game for his club, while also producing the goods in a national jersey.</p>
      <p>Goodwin said: “I don’t think this break will do him any harm, to be honest. He’s played a lot of games this season already.</p>
      <p>“When most of the other boys are getting a break he’s not had that.</p>
      <p>“Maybe this is a bit of a blessing in disguise. Being involved with the national setup does catch up with you eventually.</p>
      <p>“He’s a fantastic player and we’ve got high hopes for Kyle. There’s more to come from him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He’s reached the levels he’s capable of this season at times but I think he now needs to do that more consistently.</p>
      <p>“Like a lot of young players, we can all see the attributes they have and the potential, but they need to produce those eight out of ten games consistently.</p>
      <p>“That goes for Kyle and all of our young players.”</p>
