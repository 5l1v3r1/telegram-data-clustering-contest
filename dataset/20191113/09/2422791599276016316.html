      <p>The Prince of Wales discussed how to strengthen disaster resilience and tackle the effects of climate change at the Indian Meteorological Department in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>He arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday with a thick gray haze clouding the sky.</p>
      <p>The air quality index exceeded 450, considered "severe" and nine times the recommended maximum, according to the state-run Central Pollution Control Board.</p>
      <p>He had a short ride in an e-rickshaw driven by a woman.</p>
      <p>Air pollution in northern India peaks in the winter due to smoke from agricultural fires and fireworks during a major Hindu festival.</p>
      <p>The prince also joined celebrations of the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion, at a shrine in New Delhi to mark the community's contribution in Britain.</p>
      <p>The British High Commission said he will meet with Indian business leaders in Mumbai on Thursday to discuss sustainable markets.</p>
      <p>In September, the prince jointly launched a Sustainable Markets Council with the World Economic Forum.</p>
      <p>His 10th visit to India ends Thursday.</p>
