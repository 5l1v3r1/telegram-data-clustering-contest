      <p>In spite of steaming problems, Disney+ that offers all the premium content from Pixar, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/disney/">Disney</a>, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and about 30 seasons of the Simpsons launched yesterday and sent Disney’s stock soaring. Initially, many users couldn’t access the streaming platform.</p>

      <p>Added to this, it may take a week or thereabout for subscribers in Puerto Rico to be able to receive streaming services from the entertainment giant. In spite of all this, Disneys’ shares have been soaring which sends a strong message: The investors are confident about the new service.</p>
      <h3>Technical Glitch or Server Overload?</h3>
      <p>Most times, when services such as streaming or hosting have received too many requests from clients, such webservers are bound to experience such glitches. In what may seem like an overwhelming response from users in terms of acceptance, it shows that the users are willing to bet the farm on Disney+. The markets realized this and as Disney’s stock rallied, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/netflix/">Netflix</a> was sideways reflecting investors’ expectations about Disney+. </p>
      <p>Available on a wide variety of platforms and devices which include Roku box, the web, iOS, Android, Smart TVs, and various video game consoles and setups, the streaming service is available for $6.99 monthly. </p>
      <p>While many are considering Disney+ to be the first service that the family-oriented entertainment company has introduced, the truth is that Disney has quite a lot going under the hood as regards streaming. ESPN+ was launched last year and of course, we can’t forget popular service Hulu which comes under the Disney umbrella as well. In what seems to be the icing on the cake, the service has also added what it calls the “Disney Bundle” which includes Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu for $12.99 which corresponds to a single Netflix subscription.</p>
      <h3>Disney Played the Game Smartly</h3>
      <p>While many had been skeptical of Disney’s moves when it chose to stay away from the licensing markets, few understood that the executives at Disney had many surprises under their sleeves. The acquisitions (Fox, Marvel) and partnerships saw Disney step completely out of their regular domain to bring them at par with other giants (CBS and NBS inclusive). Their offerings now run the gamut from cartoons and animation to sports and even action series. This points to the bigger picture: Disney wants to have its hands in every pie. </p>
      <p>In terms of content, the hugely successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, National geographic (of which Disney owns 73% of its shares), 21st Century Fox and child streaming service Hulu, original content on Disney+ ( too numerous to mention here), Pixar, Star Wars and the various spinoffs from various series and movies may just turn the Entertainment company into the behemoth of entertainment in the next decade with something for everyone. And if most of this content ( if not all in time) is available for $6.99, who won’t bet the farm that Disney’s stock is set to exponentially rise and the streaming markets will soon belong to the company one way or the other?</p>
      <p>As at the time of writing this article, Disney’s stock (DIS) was at $138.58 which shows an increase of 1.35% over the past twenty-four hours. </p>
