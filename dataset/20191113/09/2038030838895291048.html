      <h1>John Legend was just named Sexiest Man Alive for 2019 – and we concur!</h1>

      <p>Cape Town – John Legend was just named People's Sexist Man Alive, and we couldn't think of a better recipient to take over the title from Idris Elba.</p>
      <p>"I was excited, but I was a little scared at the same time because it's a lot of pressure," John told <a href="https://people.com/music/john-legend-sexiest-man-alive-2019-reveal/"><b>PEOPLE</b></a>. "Everyone's going to be picking me apart to see if I'm sexy enough to hold this title. I'm [also] following Idris Elba, which is not fair and is not nice to me!"</p>

      <p>In his cover story, John spoke about his career, the lessons he learned from his parents and his family with Chrissy Teigen. "I'm so proud that I have a wife and two kids I'm so in love with," he said.</p>
      <p>Chrissy, of course, <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen"><b>tweeted</b></a> just before the news broke. "I have big news and it's killing me I can't say it and it's not a baby," she wrote. With 'in love' emojis, she later shared the news. "#EGOTPSMA," she wrote, which of course is a nod to John being an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony and now, People's Sexiest Man Alive recipient.</p>
      <p>"Updated bio," she later tweeted. It now reads, "De-motivational speaker" and "currently sleeping with people's sexiest man alive".</p>
      <p>The <i>All of Me</i> singer was also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ygfbbp8G1/"><b>congratulated by his fellow coaches on <i>The Voice</i></b></a>. "Ladies and gentlemen, the man, the myth, the legend!" Blake Shelton said, announcing John's latest accomplishment before giving his a pair of shorts with the words VEGOTSMA on it. We're guessing the 'v' stands for the Voice.</p>
