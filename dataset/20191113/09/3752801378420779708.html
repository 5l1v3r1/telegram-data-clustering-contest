      <p>That evening, at about 18:00, the community of Raliphaswa Tshikhwani village allegedly stoned and set alight a man they suspected of raping a girl.</p>
      <p>"Police attended to an attempted rape incident of a 6-year-old girl. While they were busy with their investigations, they received a complaint of mob justice, and responded immediately. When they arrived at the scene, the person was already dead and community members had left the scene. Various objects like stones and bricks were left next to the body."</p>

      <p>The deceased has been identified as Lutendo Raswiswi, 35, from Matanda village.</p>
      <p>In both incidents, police have opened cases of murder and no arrests have been made yet.</p>
      <p>"A manhunt has been launched for the suspects responsible for these acts of criminality," said Mojapelo.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who may provide information about the perpetrators should contact Lieutenant Colonel Emmanuel Mphephu on 082 565 7729, the Crime Stop number on 08600 10111 or the nearest police station."</p>
      <p>The provincial commissioner of the SAPS in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, has condemned the killings and urged all members of the community to report any criminal activity to the police and refrain from resorting to acts of vigilantism.</p>
      <p>Ledwaba said that perpetrators of these "barbaric acts be hunted down and brought to book".</p>
