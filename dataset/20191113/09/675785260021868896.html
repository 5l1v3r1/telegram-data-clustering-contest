      <h2>Andrew Collins, an experienced pilot with United Airlines, expected privacy in the bedroom at the Westin Hotel, Denver, but police said he was "acting inappropriately"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:33:21+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A father-of-three who was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/police">arrested</a> for being naked in his own hotel room has been awarded £240,000 in compensation.</p>
      <p>Pilot Andrew Collins believed he had privacy at the Westin Hotel, Denver, USA, but someone who saw him through the window nude and chatting on the phone called police.</p>
      <p>Officers said he was "acting inappropriately" and detained him.</p>
      <p>But now Captain Collins has received the huge compensation after The City of Denver paid him compensation over the wrongful arrest.</p>
      <p>Captain Collins, who has enjoyed a 26-year flying career and has stayed in more than 2,000 hotels over the world, has slammed Denver International Airport Westin (DIA).</p>

      <p>"The DIA Westin needs to make changes to warn hotel guests that the interiors of its hotel rooms do not afford privacy but are in fact visible to unseen people far away in the Denver International Airport terminal," the dad said.</p>
      <p>"The DIA Westin should take responsibility for its own behaviour …and take appropriate steps to make sure that what happened never happens to another customer."</p>
      <p>He stayed at a 10th-floor room in the hotel during a turnaround after landing his United Airlines plane at the airport.</p>
      <p>The man, at the time, was about become leader of America’s largest trade union for pilots and airline staff.</p>

      <p>"My family has had to deal with things they had nothing to do with," he told CBS4.</p>
      <p>"I have three boys who serve in the United States Air Force. They’ve had to listen to the jokes of their superiors about their father doing things in front of windows."</p>
      <p>Captain Collins’s attorney, Craig Silverman, said: "A respected family man and outstanding veteran aviator, Captain Collins was the victim of an unjustified and warrantless entry into his hotel room followed by an arrest and days of miserable incarceration.</p>
      <p>"The criminal case against Captain Collins was properly dismissed, but not before Captain Collins was suspended for half a year from his job as a direct result of the wrongful charges against him."</p>
