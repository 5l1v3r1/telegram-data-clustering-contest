      <p>A father allegedly shot his 14-year-old son to death because "he hated the fact that he was gay".</p>
      <p>Wendell Melton, 53, is accused of opening fire on Giovanni Melton in his apartment in Henderson, Nevada, US, on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Giovanni's former foster mother Sonja Jones claims she was told by a family member that the argument which led to the shooting was partly about the teenager's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lgbt?service=responsive">sexual orientation.</a></p>
      <p>Sonja said the dad had 'problems with it'.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/he-would-rather-have-a-dead-son-than-a-gay-son-former-foster-mom-speaks-about-shooting">News 3 Las Vegas</a>: "He hated the fact that his son was gay.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure that inside of his mind, he would rather have a dead son than a gay son."</p>

      <p>Sonja said a beautiful life had been taken away all because of ignorance.</p>
      <p>She said she hopes everyone remembers the teen.</p>
      <p>Friends and family say Giovanni brought smiles to the faces of everyone he met.</p>
      <p>Melton is due in a Henderson <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/courts">court</a> next week.</p>
