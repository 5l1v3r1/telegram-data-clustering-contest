      <h1>Lorraine claims 'tension' between Love Island exes Amy and Curtis during reunion</h1>
      <h2>Amy Hart and Curtis Pritchard had a chat on the red carpet at the ITV Palooza, months on from their Love Island split</h2>

      <p>Amy Hart and Curtis Pritchard's split on Love Island 2019 was the talk of the series at one point, before she left the villa.</p>
      <p>The tearful islander vowed to remain friends with Curtis, who later moved on with co-star Maura Higgins - with the two still together now.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, AJ Pritchard's brother did the red carpet presenting gig for Lorraine with the coverage airing on the morning show the following day.</p>
      <p>Lorraine Kelly praised the dancer for his efforts, before making a claim about Curtis and Amy's reunion on the carpet.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time they've come face-to-face since Love Island, and while things might obviously be awkward both have said in the past that there are no hard feelings.</p>
      <p>This didn't stop Lorraine claiming there was "tension" between the former lovers though.</p>
      <p>In a clip shown on Lorraine, Amy and Curtis hugged it out before having a little chat on camera.</p>

      <p>Lorraine's fashion presenter Mark Heyes introduced the clip, claiming things were "awkward"between the two stars.</p>
      <p>He said: "There was an awkward moment though when he met his ex Amy on the red carpet. Here's what happened."</p>
      <p>Amy told Curtis there was something "she needed to ask him later in secret", before he put her on the spot and asked her to define the term "palooza".</p>

      <p>After she made her prediction she claimed she was "always correct" as they continued to talk.</p>
      <p>Lorraine then claimed they "styled it out" but suggested things were tense.</p>
      <p>She said: "They styled it out quite well, but there's obviously a little bit of tension but it was okay."</p>
      <p>Both hosts then laughed off the moment, before changing the topic.</p>
