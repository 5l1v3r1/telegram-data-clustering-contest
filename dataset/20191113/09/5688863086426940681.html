        <b>Seasoned batsman Suryakumar Yadav feels that this is the year for him and he will make it to a call-up to the national team. The batsman further stated that when runs don’t come in smoothly for him, he still finds a way to find fluency in his batting again, as we saw in the ongoing domestic season.</b>

      <p>The very inventive cricketer has maintained a brilliant average of 93.88, while scoring at a strike rate of 163.98, across the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/vijay_hazare_trophy">Vijay </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/hazare_trophy">Hazare Trophy</a> and Deodhar Trophy and has continued with the same momentum in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20s. While the national selection is in his mind, Yadav doesn’t let the pressure of the same get to him.</p>
      <p>"If you think only about 'I have to play for India', it puts unnecessary pressure on you. But I strongly feel that the time is around the corner and I'm going to push the door this year," he was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.</p>
      <p>"Well, currently I'm just enjoying the brand of cricket I am playing. I have always loved playing fearless cricket, for any format. So, instead of thinking of 'justice' or 'injustice', I feel rather I should enjoy my cricket more, keep scoring runs, keep winning games. That will help me more to push the door and play for India.”</p>
      <p>In the emotional front, Yadav seems to be sorted as the news of his non-selection doesn’t bow down his spirit to bat well.</p>
      <p>“My father always checks all the websites any time an India A team is announced. He calls me as soon as he sees it, and tells me 'your name is not there'. I tell him 'that's not a problem'. The most important thing I feel is that you have to score so much that you force them to pick you,” the Mumbai batsman stated.</p>
      <p>"I always feel some things in life are not in our hands. If you think only about 'I have to play for India', it puts unnecessary pressure on yourself. Of course, I have been thinking that I'm not there in that circle still. But I strongly feel that the time is around the corner and I'm going to push the door this year."</p>
