      <p>Cape Town – It looks like the sand in the hourglass is about to run out on <i>Days of our Lives</i>.</p>
      <p>The long-running American soap will reportedly be going on an extended hiatus from the end of November; however, there are enough episodes banked to play out until the end of the year and into 2020.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://tvline.com/2019/11/12/days-of-our-lives-cancelled-cast-fired-season-56/"><b>TVLine</b></a> – who broke the news – the production company Corday has released the entire cast from their contracts.</p>
      <p>This news comes at a precarious time as contract renewals are being negotiated and the soapie is battling spiralling ratings. </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/entire-days-lives-cast-released-contracts-1254184"><b>The Hollywood Reporter</b></a>, an average of about 2 million viewers are tuning in daily to the current 55th season. </p>
      <p><i>Days of our Lives</i> has the lowest numbers amongst the four daytime soapies, which include <i>The Young and the Restless, The Bold and the Beautifu</i><i>l</i> and <i>General Hospital</i>.</p>
      <p>The publication further reports that if the soap is renewed, the cast would have to negotiate new contracts.</p>
      <p>South Africans won’t have to fear losing one of their favourite soapies as season 51 (2016) is currently screening on e.tv (DStv 194) weekdays at 17:15.</p>
