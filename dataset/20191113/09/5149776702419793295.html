      <h1>Urgent recall for Cadbury's Dairy Milk Little Robins after allergy concerns</h1>
      <h2>If you've bought these sweet treats, take them back for a full refund</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Carly Odell</a></address>
      <p>It might only be November, but the shelves are already lined with all things Christmas.</p>
      <p>Supermarket customers will know that you can already pick up festive treats, from mince pies to chocolates.</p>
      <p>And if you've already started your Christmas food shop you need to double check if you've picked up <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/">specific Cadbury products</a> as they may not be safe to eat.  </p>
      <p>The chocolate giant is urgently recalling its Dairy Milk Little Robins due to allergy fears.</p>
      <p>Mondelez UK, which owns Cadbury, says the Christmas treats could contain undeclared almonds.</p>

      <p>The Little Robins were incorrectly packaged with the Daim version of the same chocolate.</p>
      <p>This means the original Little Robins could pose as a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to nuts.</p>
      <p>Cadbury said: "This error may not be immediately obvious as the individual chocolate pieces within the bag are wrapped <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">in a similar foil.</a>   </p>
      <p>"If you are allergic or intolerant to almonds, please check the outside of the bag for the date code and batch code before opening the pack and do not consume the product."</p>
      <h3>Which products are affected?</h3>
      <p>Cadbury Dairy Milk Little Robins - 93g with the best before date of <b>31/03/2020</b> and either of these batch codes:  </p>
      <p><b>CIS3092812</b>   </p>
      <p>
        <b>CIS3092822</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you have products that are being recalled you should return the product to where you bought it from for a full refund.</p>
      <p>Cadbury apologised for any inconvenience caused and confirmed none of its other products are affected.</p>
