        <b>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest "confidential" report, which was leaked to media, that it had detected "natural uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at a location in Iran not declared to the agency".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said there is no need to start a scandal after the latest <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911121077290871-uranium-particles-discovered-by-iaea-in-iran-not-related-to-jcpoa---russian-senior-official/">incident in the Islamic Republic.</a> He noted, however, that both sides need to properly explain the situation.</p>
      <p>The statement comes amid a recent row between Tehran and the organisation, after Iran prevented an IAEA inspector from entering one of its facilities, and claimed she had been carrying illegal objects to the compound.</p>
      <p>The issue of the JCPOAâ€™s deterioration has been on the table since May 2018, when the US withdrew from the accord, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran. Precisely one year later, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911061077239611-iran-confirms-prevention-of-iaea-inspector-from-accessing-uranium-plant-last-week/">Iran announced it would be suspending some of its obligations</a> under the deal and promised to leave commitments every 2 months until the other signatories manage to save the accord.</p>
