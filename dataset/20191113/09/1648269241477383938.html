      <p>The 500X Sport comes exclusively with the 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 177 horsepower (132 kilowatts) and 210 pound-feet (285 Newton-meters) of torque. A nine-speed automatic is the only gearbox choice. It comes standard with the model's all-wheel-drive system with automatic rear-axle disconnect for improving efficiency when the power doesn't need to go to the back wheels. </p>
