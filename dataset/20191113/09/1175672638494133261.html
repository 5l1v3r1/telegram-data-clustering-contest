      <h1>Jaipur's Nila House store aims to preserve traditional Indian craft</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:00:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/natasha-levy/" target="_blank">Natasha Levy</a></address>
      <p>Handcrafted pieces from local artisans will be available to purchase in this lifestyle <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/store/">store</a> in Jaipur, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/india/">India</a>, which features interiors developed by Bijoy Jain.</p>
      <p>Offering a selection of handwoven and naturally dyed products, <a href="https://www.nilajaipur.com/">Nila House</a> sets out to be a "repository of knowledge" on traditional Indian craft techniques.</p>
      <p>The store – which includes an archive, workshops and library – is the brainchild of the <a href="https://www.bamford.com/uk/articles/the-lady-bamford-charitable-trust/">Lady Bamford Charitable Trust</a>, which works to support disadvantaged communities throughout India.</p>

      <p>"Nila House is not about retail, it's an experience – embracing what traditional craft means and how it can reflect the modern-day world," the store's director, Anuradha Singh, told Dezeen.</p>
      <p>"It is a dynamic space for interactions, collaborations, education and so much more."</p>

      <p>"My relationship with India goes back over forty years and in that time I have developed a deep love and appreciation for the country, its people and the richness of Indian handmade traditions," continued the charity's founder, Carole Bamford.</p>
      <p>"Creative exchange and the sharing of ideas is at the heart of any thriving community and my hope is that Nila will encourage a lively conversation between artists, makers and designers from around the world."</p>

      <p>The store takes over a 1940s residence in Jaipur that, after being left vacant for several years, had fallen into a state of disrepair.</p>
      <p>Indian architect Bijoy Jain of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/studio-mumbai/">Studio Mumbai</a> transformed the building to feature a series of whitewashed spaces, each arranged around a central courtyard that's bordered by ornate marble columns.</p>

      <p>At the time of its opening, the store decided to present an indigo-themed array of clothing and homeware – India was one of the earliest producers of the deep-blue pigment and is allegedly from where the colour takes its name.</p>
      <p>The inaugural collection was also meant to be a subtle nod to the store's name, Nila, which means blue in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit.</p>

      <p>Striped rugs, patterned plates, shirts and linens were presented in the main retail room, which features backlit shelves and display rails embedded in rough chunks of stone.</p>
      <p>Fluted glass doors lead through to the textile archive and reading room, which is filled with arts and craft-related titles.</p>
      <p>There are also a host of workshops that can be used by local creatives and Nila House's artists-in-residence, who will be encouraged to collaborate and produce pieces for the store.</p>

      <p>A growing number of brands, architects and designers are making moves to safeguard India's design heritage.</p>
      <p>Early last year saw IKEA work with two social enterprises to produce <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/03/30/ikea-supports-marginalised-women-india-handmade-homeware-collection/">Innehållsrik</a> – an 18-piece homeware collection that makes use of materials handcrafted by Indian artisans.</p>
