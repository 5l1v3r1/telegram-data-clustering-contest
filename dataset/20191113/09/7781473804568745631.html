      <h1>Upcoming Kia QYi sub-four-metre SUV spied in India</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T09:33:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Kia Motors' next big mass-market launch for India will be the sub-four-metre SUV you see here. The Carnival MPV will debut before this but is expected to cater a relatively niche audience. The small SUV, codenamed the QYi, is expected to come to market by the middle of 2020 and share quite a bit with the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/venue-m749/">Hyundai Venue</a>.</p>

      <p>As with other Hyundai-Kia products, the Kia compact SUV is expected to differ quite a bit from the Venue stylistically. These pictures show that the Kia seems to have a squatter look, with a less-upright rear section. The glass-area too seems a bit more flowing, with two-part LED tail lamps with same ice-cube elements as seen on the Seltos. The front end seems to sport quite an aggressive face, with a high edge and dominated by a variation of the brand's Tiger Nose grille. The headlamps look like large squarish units in a two-part layout. We also think Kia will provide for a top-spec fully-kitted DCT/turbo GT-Line variant, given how this test mule seems to sport the GT-Line spec alloys from the Seltos.</p>

      <p>The interiors are expected to carry forward a similar feature set as the Venue but with some segment-first additions like a 360-degree camera, etc. But the design elements will carry a more Kia focussed theme with the different materials and finishes. We expect the same set of engines and transmissions to carry over.</p>

      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/hyundai-venue-vs-mahindra-xuv300-vs-tata-nexon-vs-maruti-suzuki-vitara-brezza-vs-ford-ecosport/">The Venue SUV gets two petrol and one diesel engines</a> which are mated to two manual and one dual-clutch automatic transmission in various permutations. One of the petrols, is<a href="http://overdrive.in/news/more-on-the-hyundai-venue-compact-suvs-1-0-litre-turbo-petrol-motor/"> the new Kappa T-GDI 1.0-litre turbo</a>. This 3-cylinder motor makes 120PS and 172Nm. The other petrol motor, for lower-spec cars, is the 1.2-litre petrol with 83PS and 116Nm, as seen on various Hyundai cars in India. The single diesel option is the 1.4-litre 4-cylinder turbo diesel motor which puts out 90PS and 220Nm, paired with a 6-speed manual.</p>
      <p>The Kia QYi is one of <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/kia-stinger-sedan-sorento-and-telluride-suvs-under-consideration-for-india/">six to eight cars Kia Motors wants to launch in the Indian market</a> over the next three years.</p>
