      <p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1055462/it-s-official-friends-is-leaving-netflix-for-hbo-max-in-2020?7e8ZHP">E! News reported</a> that  the sitcom "Friends" is going to WarnerMedia's HBO Max streaming service, which will also air "Pretty Little Liars" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air."</p>
      <p>Netflix announced in July that "Friends" is leaving at the start of 2020. </p>
      <p>Netflix <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-100-mill-for-friends-proves-old-series-still-matter/">reportedly spent $100 million</a> to keep "Friends" <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1069726733379629057">available on the platform through 2019</a> after fans panicked about it leaving at the top of the year.</p>
      <p>Despite the age of the "Friends" sitcom, it has spawned a devoted youthful viewership, especially among tween and teen girls who weren't yet born when it went off the air in 2004. </p>
      <p>In an era when everyone assumed they would move on to YouTube and Instagram video, young girls have embraced the series and its old-fashioned, studio audience, sitcom format, bingeing its 10 seasons on Netflix through their tablets and phones, wearing T-shirts with the show's logo on them and constantly quoting catchphrases.</p>
      <p>"It is old but you can't tell that much when you're watching," said 15-year-old Sammy Joyce, of Long Beach, California. "It's too funny to care about how old it is."</p>
