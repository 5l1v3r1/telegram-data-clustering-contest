      <h2>Parkes urged West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini to axe goalkeeper immediately and call up Dave Martin as Premier League strugglers suffer 'crisis of confidence'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T02:42:14+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 02:42</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>West Ham legend Phil Parkes fears current keeper Roberto 'looks like an outfield player' trying his hand in goal.</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini’s understudy to the injured Lukasz Fabianski has come in for fierce criticism during his short spell between the sticks.</p>
      <p>Five of the last six goals conceded by West Ham have been from corners or free-kicks, with Roberto in particular at fault.</p>
      <p>It has led the club to consider a new reserve keeper in January and Parkes - the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper when he moved to Upton Park from QPR in 1979 – believes the situation is rapidly becoming critical.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty obvious he’s not very good!” said Parkes.</p>

      <p>“In fact I remarked to a mate when I watched him in the Oxford United game that he may have a clause in his contract which ensures he doesn’t have to dive for the ball!</p>
      <p>“These are worrying times and things need to change – the goalkeeping situation has to be addressed right away.”</p>
      <p>Roberto conceded four goals at League One Oxford as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> crashed out of the Carabao Cup last month.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old has now conceded 15 goals in his last six starts included three at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> earlier this month and another three at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> last weekend.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the Claret and Hugh website, Parkes added: “I don’t like him at all and to be honest he doesn’t even look like a goalkeeper to me.</p>
      <p>"He looks like an outfield player who has somehow found his way between the sticks.</p>
      <p>“We might have got away with him over a couple of games but the idea of him being in there until January is a serious worry and it’s hardly any wonder the team is suffering a crisis of confidence.</p>

      <p>“The lads would have known what to expect when they saw him on the training ground and the worries will have been there for some time and it really is showing.</p>
      <p>“There can be no question when that happens results are going to be affected – the back four and Roberto seem to have little in common and the defenders clearly have little faith in him.</p>
      <p>“After Saturday’s performance that can only get worse and I think the manager needs to make sure that Alvin’s son Dave Martin is between the posts against Spurs.”</p>
