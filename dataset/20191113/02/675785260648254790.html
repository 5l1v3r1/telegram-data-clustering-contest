      <h2>CCTV footage showed British backpacker Grace Millane's alleged killer transporting a suitcase containing her dead body. The defendant is accused of murdering Grace after a Tinder date</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T02:49:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 02:49</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Stephen D'Antal, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>The parents of Grace Millane wept in court today as they watched CCTV showing her alleged killer taking her body to the woods.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the 27-year-old defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stuffed the British backpackers body into a suitcase and buried it in bushland in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Her parents and their police chaperone broke down in tears today as footage was shown in Auckland High Court, where the alleged killer is on trial for murdering the British backpacker.</p>
      <p>He denies the charge and instead claims Grace, who he met through the dating application Tinder, died by accident during rough sex.</p>

      <p>Property developer David Millane, 61, and his wife Gill, from Wickford in Essex, have sat through every day of the harrowing murder trial.</p>
      <p>They have heard how their daughter died the night before her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>Today, the mum and dad saw how cameras captured her date buying a suitcase and a shovel and transporting her body in a red Toyota hatchback he rented the day she died in December last year.</p>

      <p>The powerfully built man was seen wheeling a luggage trolley into a lift at the CityLife hotel in central Auckland where he lived full time and going up to his GBP190 a week room.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards, he returned with the trolley laden with two suitcases, one of which he has since admitted contained university graduate Grace’s naked body folded into a foetal position.</p>
      <p>Mr and Mrs Millane wept quietly and were comforted by Detective Toni Jordan, a family liaison officer who was herself wiping away tears.</p>

      <p>Det Jordan gave evidence yesterday about how she had spotted the suspect outside the CityLife in central Auckland where he lived and had run after him with a colleague before taking him for questioning him at a police station.</p>
      <p>The officer has since been a constant companion to the Millanes throughout their ordeal, travelling to Britain to access Grace’s laptop and other personal belongings.</p>
      <p>Jurors were earlier shown images of the moment detectives found the suitcase in a wooded area outside Auckland where she had been on a Tinder date.</p>

      <p>Police tracked down the burial site through the movements of the 27-year-old defendant’s phone, which led them to a lay-by about 10 miles west of the city.</p>
      <p>Police and forensic experts have already told the court how the shallow grave was found about 15 yards from the road.</p>
      <p>Grace's body was naked, but intact, in a foetal position.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
