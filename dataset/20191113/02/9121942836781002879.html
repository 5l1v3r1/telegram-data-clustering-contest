      <p>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A Syrian man on trial in Hungary has denied charges that he took part in a beheading and other killings in his homeland while a member of the Islamic State group.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the 27-year-old identified only as Hassan F. participated in the beheading of a religious leader in the city of al-Sukhnah in Homs province and was also involved in the killings of at least 25 people.</p>
      <p>As the trial started Wednesday, his defense lawyer asked the court to reject many of the pre-trial testimonies implicating his client, in part because they were by people who did not personally witness the alleged crimes.</p>
      <p>According to his indictment, Hassan F. was the commander of a small, armed IS unit.</p>
