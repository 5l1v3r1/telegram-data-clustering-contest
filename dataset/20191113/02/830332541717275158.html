      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - The state Assembly has passed a resolution declaring the giant evergreen the state Department of Administration places in the state Capitol every December is officially a Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers called the tree a holiday tree on Friday. His predecessor, Republican Scott Walker, had said the tree was a Christmas tree. Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald called Evers' move "PC garbage."</p>
      <p>Republican Rep. Scott Krug introduced the resolution on Monday. Assembly Republicans added it Tuesday's floor calendar. Krug told the body in a floor speech that Evers is trying to exclude Christians from the holiday season.</p>
      <p>Democrats railed against the resolution. Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, who is Jewish, said if Republicans want to help Christians they should pass gun control legislation to stop them from getting killed.</p>
      <p>The Assembly ultimately adopted the resolution 64-30.</p>
