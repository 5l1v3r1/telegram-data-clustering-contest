      <p>BOSTON (AP) — A former insurance executive is returning to court to be sentenced for paying $450,000 to get his son and daughter into the University of Southern California as fake athletes.</p>
      <p>Toby MacFarlane is scheduled to be sentenced in Boston’s federal court Wednesday. The 56-year-old Del Mar, California, resident pleaded guilty to a single count of fraud and conspiracy in June.</p>
      <p>Authorities say MacFarlane paid the scheme’s organizers $200,000 to get his daughter into USC as a fake soccer star in 2014, and then paid $250,000 to get his son admitted as a fake basketball recruit in 2017.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are recommending a year in prison. His lawyers say he deserves leniency.</p>
      <p>MacFarlane has apologized and said he agreed to participate in the scheme at a time when his marriage was falling apart.</p>
