      <p>After what felt like endless casting controversy that involved <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/harry-styles-turned-down-prince-eric-in-the-little-mermaid.html">Harry Styles</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lizzo/status/1057897318052126720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1057897318052126720&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2019%2F06%2Fmelissa-mccarthy-ursula-little-mermaid.html">Lizzo</a>, Disney has finally rounded out its live-action <i>Little Mermaid </i>cast with Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric. Hauer-King’s previous credits include <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/how-torturous-is-a-dogs-way-home-for-animal-lovers.html"><i>A Dog’s Way Home</i></a><i> </i>and <i>The Song of Names</i>. He also joined a long list of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/hugh-grant-little-women-movie-1994.html">lanky brunette heartthrobs</a> who have played Laurie after he starred in PBS’ 2017 <i>Little Women </i>miniseries. Hauer-King will star alongside <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/halle-bailey-ariel-live-action-little-mermaid.html">Halle Bailey as Ariel</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/the-little-mermaid/">Melissa McCarthy as Ursula</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/jacob-tremblay-awkwafina-might-join-the-little-mermaid-cast.html">Awkwafina as Scuttle, and Jacob Tremblay as Flounder</a>. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/javier-bardem-might-join-the-little-mermaid-as-king-triton.html">Javier Bardem</a> is also in talks to join as King Triton. Rob Marshall is set to direct the film, which does not yet have a premiere date. This is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-little-mermaid-live-flounder-puppet.html">just as well</a>, as we may need a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/little-mermaid-live-best-worst-moments.html">palate cleanser</a> between <i>Little Mermaid </i>adaptations.</p>
