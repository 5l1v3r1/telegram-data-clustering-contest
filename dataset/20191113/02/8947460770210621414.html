      <p>20 years later and the BMW Z8 Roadster is still a stunning piece of German engineering. And according to <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/2000-bmw-z8-7/"><i>Bring-a-Trailer</i></a>, you can now bid on a low miles (12,500), pristine condition 2000 BMW Z8 Roadster. The listing mentions that this Z8 was purchased new by the seller at Long Beach BMW in California and is one of just 317 examples sold in the US for the model year.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, this 2000 BMW Z8 Roadster is being offered with its coffee table book, a removable hardtop, hardtop cover and stand, factory books and manuals, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.</p>

      <p>Power to this Z8 comes from a 4.9-liter DOHC V8 producing 394 horsepower and 368 lb-ft torque when new. The power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential.</p>
      <p>The car also features heated powered seats and automatic climate control, and the car has been modified with a Bluetooth adapter and Lojack system. Inside, black Nappa leather upholstery is contrasted with aluminum interior trim.</p>

      <p>When the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2017/06/06/bmw-z8-prices-skyrocketed/">BMW Z8</a> debuted, it was a beautiful design throwback to the original<a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/01/18/bmw-507-roadster-confirmed-to-attend-retromobile-2019-in-paris/"> BMW 507</a>. Designed by Henrik Fisker, the BMW Z8 was a stunning machine, one that hit all the right notes; long hood, short deck, short overhangs and muscular haunches. It was gorgeous and still is today.</p>
      <p>Globally, there were 5,703 Z8s were ever built, with 2,543 examples making their way to the US. Certainly, that drives its value up as well.</p>
      <p>For now, at 10PM EST on Nov 12, 2019, the bidding price was up to $90,000 with 6 days left. So it’s more than likely that it will fetch a price of over $100,000.</p>
