      <h1>Dip your fries into Wendy’s first new Frosty flavor since the dessert debuted</h1>

      <p>One of the most familiar, beloved aspects of Wendy’s, besides the red-haired girl with pigtails in the logo, is the chain’s iconic Frosty dessert. People have been dunking their fries into those smooth chocolate Frostys ever since Wendy’s got its start way back in 1969. Menu items have come and gone since then. The sweet, simple Frosty endures.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Wendy’s has decided to take a bold, dramatic step in honor of its 50th anniversary on Friday, November 15. What a perfect moment, the chain decided, to bless us all with something new — for the first time, a new Frosty flavor (that of a birthday cake, of course).</p>
      <p>For a limited time, the Birthday Cake Frosty is actually one of two similarly-favored sweet treats you can pick up at participating Wendy’s locations. The second item is a Birthday Cake Frosty Cookie Sundae, and both desserts <a href="https://menu.wendys.com/en_US/category/frosty/">can be found online</a> under the dessert listings on Wendy’s official website:</p>

      <p>According to a Wendy’s <a href="https://www.squaredealblog.com/homewendys/wendys-50th-anniversary-birthday-cake-frosty">press release</a>, the sundae “starts with our creamy vanilla Frosty mixed with the flavor of classic birthday cake, then is topped with sugar cookie pieces and sprinkles. It’s a birthday party in a cup (no off-tune singing or party hat required)!” And, as we alluded to, its unveiling is kind of a big deal for the chain, which has stuck to its knitting Frosty-wise since its founding — and which, in a typical year, sells more than 300 million of its standard Frosty.</p>
      <p>The small Birthday Cake Frosty is selling for $1.49, while the sundae costs just a little more ($2.19).</p>
      <p>Wendy’s got its start in 1969, being founded in Columbus, Ohio, by Dave Thomas. Among the things the chain quickly became known for was its made-to-order hamburgers that used square patties in lieu of the more familiar round burger patty. That’s in addition to, of course, other signature items like chili, baked potatoes, and, of course, the Frosty dessert.</p>
