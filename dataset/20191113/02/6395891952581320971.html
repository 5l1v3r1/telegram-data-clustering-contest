      <h1>Most distant world ever explored gets new name: Arrokoth</h1>

      <p><b>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)</b> - The most distant world ever explored 4 billion miles away finally has an official name: Arrokoth.</p>
      <p>That means "sky" in the language of the Native American Powhatan people, NASA said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past the snowman-shaped Arrokoth on New Year's Day, 3 ½ years after exploring Pluto. At the time, this small icy world 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto was nicknamed Ultima Thule given its vast distance from us.</p>
      <p>"The name 'Arrokoth' reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies," lead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said in a statement, "and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own."</p>
      <p>The name was picked because of the Powhatan's ties to the Chesapeake Bay region.</p>
      <p>New Horizons is operated from Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland. The Hubble Space Telescope - which discovered Arrokoth in 2014 - has its science operations in Baltimore.</p>
      <p>The New Horizons team got consent for the name from Powhatan Tribal elders and representatives, according to NASA. The International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center approved the choice.</p>
      <p>Arrokoth is among countless objects in the so-called Kuiper Belt, or vast Twilight Zone beyond the orbit of Neptune. New Horizons will observe some of these objects from afar as it makes its way deeper into space.</p>
