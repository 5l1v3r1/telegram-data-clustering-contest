      <p>Mariah Carey officially <a href="https://twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/1190161809887694848?s=20"><u>gave us permission</u></a> to start celebrating Christmas, which means it’s time to finally check out all the holiday movies 2019 has to offer. From a Vanessa Hudgens Netflix special to a Bill Hader and Anna Kendrick collab, we’ve got 10 new Christmas movies for you to binge when you finally get tired of watching <i>The Grinch</i> for the 100th time.</p>
      <h3>Last Christmas</h3>
      <p>We stan anything Emilia Clarke. (And Henry Golding as her love interest doesn’t hurt.) But beware: This Christmas rom-com has a twist ending that you’re probably not prepared for.</p>
      <h4>Release date: November 8 in theaters</h4>

      <h3>The Knight Before Christmas</h3>
      <p>Vanessa Hudgens plays a science teacher who falls in love with a medieval knight who somehow time-traveled to the future. Need we say more?</p>
      <h4>Release date: November 21 on Netflix</h4>

      <h3>Frozen 2</h3>
      <p>Anna and Elsa are back to make all our holiday soundtrack dreams come true. The two make more mems with Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven as they set out to *yet again* save their kingdom.</p>
      <h4>Release date: November 22 in theaters</h4>

      <h3>Holiday in the Wild</h3>
      <p>Kristin Davis plays Kate, a woman who travels to Africa by herself after her husband files for divorce. She meets a handsome-AF pilot (played by Rob Lowe). But he’s not the only eye candy this movie gives us—we also get tons of adorable baby elephants.</p>
      <h4>Release date: November 1 on Netflix</h4>

      <h3>Christmas Under the Stars</h3>
      <p>We are graced with the presence of Jesse Metcalfe in this holiday Hallmark movie. (Seriously, tho, where has John Tucker been?) He plays a classic finance bro who loses his job and has to start working at a Christmas tree lot, where he *of course* finds love. Classic tale.</p>
      <h4>Release date: November 16 on Lifetime</h4>

      <h3>Noelle</h3>
      <p>Anna Kendrick plays Noelle Kringle, aka Santa Claus’s daughter, and Bill Hader plays her brother, Nick. The duo we didn’t know we needed. Noelle has to save Christmas after Nick gets freaked out by the responsibility of taking over for his dad. Classic woman-saving-the-day plotline.</p>
      <h4>Release date: November 12 on Disney+</h4>

      <h3>Let It Snow</h3>
      <p>This YA rom-com will melt your little ice-cold heart this holiday season. Basically, a bunch of teenagers fall in love with each other during a snowstorm in a small Midwestern town. Also, there’s a queer love story that didn’t actually appear in the book the film is based on!</p>
      <h4>Release date: November 8 on Netflix</h4>
