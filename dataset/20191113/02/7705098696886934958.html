      <h1>Marvel Studios’ Spider-Man Films Aren’t Coming to Disney+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T02:01:14+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 02:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>As of now, there are 16 Marvel Studios films available to stream on Disney+. However, among the more glaring omissions are the studio’s two live-action films headlined by your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Unfortunately, fans hoping to watch <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming"><b>Spider-Man: Homecoming</b></a> or <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-far-from-home"><b>Spider-Man: Far From Home</b></a> on the new streaming service are in for a big disappointment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20956671/disney-plus-marvel-spider-man-tom-holland-avengers-endgame-netflix-fox-xmen">The Verge</a> recently spoke to Ricky Strauss, Disney+’s head of content and marketing, at a New York media event. When asked if the platform would ever add Peter Parker’s latest cinematic outings to its library, Strauss didn’t mince words.</p>
      <p>“We love our friends at Sony, but we don’t have any plans to have the live-action Spider-Man movies on Disney+, ” said Strauss. “We will have all the Spider-Man animated shows that we did so they’ll be on there under the Marvel banner. But who knows what can happen in the future?”</p>

      <p>Since Marvel only co-produces the Tom Holland-led <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man"><b>Spider-Man</b></a> films with Sony, this news wasn’t unexpected. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily kill the character’s future in streaming. Sony has most recently licensed both <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-3"><b>Spider-Man 3</b></a> and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse"><b>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</b></a> to Netflix. So if the newer movies were to end up on another streaming platform, this seems like the most logical choice.</p>
      <p>Regardless, there’s still plenty of other Spidey-related content on Disney+ for subscribers to sink their teeth into. Viewers can watch just about every animated series that has featured the webslinger over the last few decades. Some of the more contemporary options include the ongoing <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/marvels-spider-man"><b>Marvel’s Spider-Man</b></a> series as well as <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/ultimate-spider-man"><b>Ultimate Spider-Man</b></a>. Additionally, the more nostalgic crowd can binge episodes of classic series like <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-unlimited"><b>Spider-Man Unlimited</b></a>, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-and-his-amazing-friends"><b>Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</b></a>, and the fan-favorite ‘90s cartoon.</p>
      <p>Should Sony and Marvel try to work out a new deal over Spider-Man’s streaming rights? Tell us what you think in the comment section below!</p>
