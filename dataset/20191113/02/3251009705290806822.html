      <p>Vilangan Hills is a hillock located in Adat Panchayat, near Thrissur city of Kerala state in India. The hill gives a panoramic view of Thrissur city and Thrissur Kole Wetlands from the top.</p>
      <p>The hill was referred as a Oxygen Jar of Thrissur city. The name ‘Vilangan Kunnu’ is a misnomer because ‘Vilangan’ itself means hill. There is no need of adding ‘Kunnu’ after ‘Vilangan’. It is an ancient Malayalam word derived from proto-Dravidian language.</p>
      <p>Till the 1970s the word ‘Kunnu’ was not used by revenue authorities and locals. It is a recent addition. In Tamil too ‘Vilangan’ means hill.</p>
      <p>The Vilangan is a laterite hill which has a radius of 8 kilometres. The top of the hill is around 5 acres and the height is 80 metres from the sea level. The hill earlier was a military base and an observation camp during World War II.</p>

      <p>The hill has an open-air theatre, children’s park, Kudumbashree canteen, Vilangan Trekkers Club and Asokavanam Samiti. The hill has a medicinal garden called Asokavanam maintained by Vilangan Trekkers Club and Asokavanam Samiti in association with Department of Tourism (Kerala) and Oushadhi.</p>
      <p>The foot of the hill opens at the highway near Amala Hospital and the road to the apex of the hill starts from here.[9] The hill remains open from 07.00 AM to 07.00 PM in the evening.</p>
      <p>While it’s a great place to just commune with the evening breeze and enjoy the sunset, there are a number of recreational activities available too. There is a children’s park, a trekker’s club, an awesome open-air theatre as well as the Asokanvanam Samiti. There is also a medicinal garden being cultivated here.</p>
      <p>The splendid scenery and tranquil silence make this hillock a favourite place for all age groups, young and old. It’s a favourite haunt for young couples for private, placid short strolls away from peeping eyes and with the perfect backdrop of a picturesque locale. Even schools make arrangements to bring their children here for fun-filled picnics. The hill is lush green with a verdant cover of trees and bushes that are a balm to city-bred eyes.</p>
      <p>Aside from this, it’s a favourite morning walk route for many people with the scenic sunrise being the perfect bonus for their efforts. However, when going up the hill in a vehicle, do be careful as the roads are pretty narrow and caution needs to be practised, especially during the rainy season.</p>
      <p>Sitting at the top of the hill and watching the city of Thrissur spread out at its base is akin to sitting in an open-air theatre. This scenic location is being run by the Thrissur District Tourism Promotion Council and draws its fair share of tourists, local and outsiders alike.</p>
