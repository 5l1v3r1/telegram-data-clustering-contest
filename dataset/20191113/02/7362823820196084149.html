      <p>Alcohol may be to blame for the death of a fraternity brother at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/washington">Washington State University</a> (WSU), investigators said, as the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college">school</a> on Tuesday suspended all fraternity and sorority events in the interim.</p>
      <p>Members of Alpha Tau Omega called 911 after a 19-year-old fraternity member -- whose identity has not yet been released -- was found unresponsive. Students at the house tried to perform CPR to no avail, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-investigating-death-fraternity-member-washington-state-university-n1080911">NBC News</a> reported.</p>
      <p>When first responders arrived at the off-campus house at around 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, the teenager was unconscious and not breathing, Pullman Police Operations Commander Jake Opgenorth said, according to reports by <a href="https://www.krem.com/article/news/crime/police-investigate-death-at-wsu-frat/293-0e47714c-80b5-4387-8c18-fe491c919749">KREM</a>. Medics later pronounced the student dead.</p>

      <p>The Whitman County Coroner's office has not yet released the official cause of death. Police said alcohol may have played a role, but did not elaborate.</p>
      <p>"In response to this situation, all fraternities and sororities within the WSU Greek community have self-imposed an immediate suspension of all social events for the remainder of the semester," WSU spokesman Phil Weiler said in a news release.</p>
      <p>This was not the first time WSU's fraternities have come under scrutiny; in October 2016, a 21-year-old WSU student was found dead inside of a bedroom at the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity house. The medical examiner's office determined the student died of intoxication from a combination of methadone and alprazolam, also known as Xanax.</p>
      <p>Days ago, a 19-year-old freshman at San Diego State University (SDSU) died after leaving a frat party, investigators said.</p>
      <p>A roommate of Dylan Hernandez called police after he discovered Hernandez did not have a pulse when he returned to the residence hall. Paramedics rushed him to a hospital last Thursday, and he died Sunday.</p>

      <p>His specific cause of death was unclear.</p>
      <p>Following his death, SDSU suspended 14 of its fraternities as a university police investigation revealed allegations "that a fraternity was involved in possible misconduct."</p>
