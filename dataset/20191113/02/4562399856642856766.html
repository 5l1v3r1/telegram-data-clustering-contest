      <h1>3 things learned from Manchester United’s emphatic victory over Brighton</h1>

      <h4>Manchester United defeated Brighton 3-1 on Sunday afternoon in what was a crucial win for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Not only was it an important result but the performance was also very pleasing on the eye.</h4>
      <p>Academy graduate Brandon Williams made his first Premier League start for the club, replacing the suspended Ashley Young – the only change Solskjaer made to the team that lost 1-0 to Bournemouth a week before.</p>
      <p>United started brightly with Andreas Pereira’s deflected shot breaking the deadlock in the 17th minute. Two minutes later, a Davy Propper own goal doubled their lead despite a worryingly lengthy VAR check for a possible handball in the build-up. The check was cleared and the goal stood.</p>
      <p>Just after the half-hour mark, Brighton pulled a goal back via Lewis Dunk heading in from a corner at close range. However, within two minutes once again, Rashford ensured the Red Devil’s lead was restored to two goals. Anthony Martial was slotted through by Fred, the Frenchman checked his run and played the ball back to Rashford, who side-footed home via the underside of the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Man Utd had a number of chances to extend their lead further, but were denied by Australian Matt Ryan who was contempt on keeping his goals conceded tally to just three for the day.</p>
      <p>Here are three things we learned from the match.</p>

      <h3>Brandon Williams could be something special</h3>
      <p>The latest product from Manchester United’s academy conveyor belt is proving to be some talent. Brandon Williams, who is 19 years of age, has taken to senior football like a duck to water. The youngster has had to step up fairly quickly due to the injury sustained by Luke Shaw earlier this season and so far he has done very well indeed.</p>
      <p>Many fans are now calling for Solskjaer to start Williams over and above Young on a regular basis. This would be a brave call considering Young is the club captain and is the more experienced pro. But, what Williams doesn’t have in experience, he certainly makes up for with his energy and tenacity in defence and attack.</p>
      <p>After the international break, United’s next test is away to Sheffield United in the cauldron that is Bramall Lane – so will Solskjaer stick or twist?</p>

      <h3>Fred is finding his feet</h3>
      <p>One man who seems to be hitting his straps in the current United side is Fred. The Brazilian has certainly had his critics during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but alongside Scott McTominay in the heart of Solskjaer’s midfield, he has improved immensely.</p>
      <p>Is he proving his £50 million pound transfer fee? Not yet. But, his combativeness, determination and desire to pass forward has caught the eye of the United fans over the past few games.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen as to whether or not Fred will keep his place when Paul Pogba returns to the team. Will Pogba be an automatic selection when fit? You’d assume so, therefore, Fred has to do everything he can to make sure he is undroppable until then.</p>

      <h3>Rashford &amp; Martial have real chemistry</h3>
      <p>Manchester United’s number nine and ten are striking up a wonderful partnership at the moment. Marcus Rashford has been the more frequent scoring of the two, <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/marcus-rashford/leistungsdaten/spieler/258923"><b>netting six goals in his last six games</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Anthony Martial’s contribution to the team can’t be underestimated though. Since his return from injury, the Frenchman has been involved in <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/anthony-martial/leistungsdaten/spieler/182877"><b>five goals in five starts, scoring three and registering two assists</b></a>.</p>
      <p>With Daniel James alongside them, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a very potent attacking front three full of pace and power at his disposal. One that is growing and improving game by game.</p>
