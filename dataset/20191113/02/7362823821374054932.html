      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/khloe-kardashian-ex-lamar-odom-throws-shade-praises-all-natural-girlfriend">Lamar Odom</a>'s son, Lamar Morales-Odom Jr., was initially taken aback by his dad's engagement news but said that ultimately he only has good wishes for his father.</p>
      <p>The former NBA star dropped a bombshell on Monday, revealing on social media that he was engaged to personal trainer Sabrina Parr.</p>
      <p>"Last night I was emotional seeing my father got engaged through social media," 17-year-old Lamar Jr. wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday following the announcement. "I was hurt and caught off guard."</p>

      <p>He continued: "At the end of the day, I am a teenager, that is becoming a young man. I have to be responsible for what I post, I have nothing but love for my dad and want what’s best for him."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1092640/lamar-odom-s-son-was-hurt-after-finding-out-about-his-dad-s-engagement-on-instagram">E! News</a>, the younger Odon's statement comes after a since-deleted comment screenshotted by The Shade Room that allegedly detailed his frustration.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lamar-odoms-family-blindsided-by-engagement-to-sabrina-parr/">Us Weekly</a>, Odom's 21-year-old daughter, Destiny, has not spoken about her father's engagement publicly.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a source told the outlet that "Lamar’s family didn’t know he was proposing."</p>

      <p>"It was a shock," the insider added. "Everyone is surprised that he rushed into an engagement. His friends and family really want the best for him."</p>
      <p>The source then alleged that "Sabrina has the relationship on a fast track, and Lamar’s friends and family want Lamar and Sabrina to know each other better before moving too fast.</p>
      <p>"Lamar’s family is definitely worried about him," the source concluded.</p>
