      <p>Kuta in Bali has no shortage of scenic spots, with sandy beaches and Instagrammable cafes. It’s no wonder the popular surf spot has been featured on many a millennial’s carefully curated Instagram feed. When you need a break from catching those waves though, you’ll need to refuel — so why not check out <a href="http://bingbong.club/">BingBong</a>, a brand new dessert spot with the tagline “where happiness happens”. There’s no doubt that fans of alliteration and the chronically sweet-toothed will be more than well taken care of here.</p>

      <p>Millennials will be familiar with the adage that “the camera eats first”, and it’s especially true at BingBong as every pastel-hued concoction will have you wanting to take a pic before you take a bite. Your eyeballs will definitely be eating good too, ‘cause the entire cafe is a feast for the eyes. Here you’ll find exposed light bulbs and retro neon signs adorning the brightly colored walls. </p>

      <p>Opt for BingBong’s signature flavors of Black Mamba, or their Double Dip Beng Beng, or DDBB for short, is made with real Beng Beng wafers. So what else is on the menu? How about a BingBong Bingshake — a next-level milkshake topped with chocolate, whipping cream, Kitkat chunks, marshmallows, jellybeans, and more?</p>
