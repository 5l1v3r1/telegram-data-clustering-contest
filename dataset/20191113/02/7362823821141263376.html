      <p>Former White House Press Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-spicer-eliminated-from-dancing-with-the-stars">Sean Spicer</a> reacted Tuesday to being voted off ABC's "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-spicer-eliminated-from-dancing-with-the-stars">Dancing with the Stars</a>," saying it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and thanking his fans for their support.</p>
      <p>Spicer told "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">Tucker Carlson Tonight</a>" that earning a spot in the quarterfinals before leaving the show was farther than he originally thought he would go in the competition.</p>
      <p>"I went into this thinking one, two weeks maybe -- I'm not really good at this. But, I'll have fun, I'll learn something," he said.</p>
      <p>"I really really enjoyed this -- It exceeded my expectations."</p>

      <p>Spicer told host Tucker Carlson he had a long list of people to thank, from the many Americans who voted for him each week, to Fox News host Jesse Watters, to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> himself.</p>
      <p>"I loved being part of the show. It was a great experience. And I think I'm better for it," he added. "Honestly, I had a blast."</p>
      <p>However, Carlson later asked Spicer about "DWTS" host Tom Bergeron's August tweet lamenting the "divisive bookings" for the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>Bergeron wrote how he hoped the new season “would be a joyful respite from our exhausting political climate and free of inevitably divisive bookings from ANY party affiliations.”</p>
      <p>"We can all agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it's [the producers'] call," the former "Hollywood Squares" host continued. "I'll leave it to them to answer any further questions about those decisions."</p>

      <p>Spicer said he did not think much about the comments, which did not mention the former Republican official or any other contestant by name.</p>
      <p>"It's not the first time that somebody put in some negative comments about me," he said.</p>

      <p>Spicer also told Carlson his tenure on "Dancing with the Stars" showed a diverse group of people can come together, and that it is important to "lead by example."</p>
      <p>"I thought that was this show does so well is [to] bring these people together, support each other, root for each other, leave all of that rest of that stuff aside."</p>
