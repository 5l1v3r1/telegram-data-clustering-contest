      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — A cast member of Hong Kong television series <i>Finding Her Voice</i> that stars Jacqueline Wong said he hopes the original cast will be maintained if TVB decided to have a sequel.</p>
      <p>Hugo Ng, who plays the character diagnosed with cancer and starts singing in a pub in order to chase his dream and spend his days meaningfully, was all praise for his co-stars Wong and Owen Cheung for being able to fully dive into their roles.</p>
      <p>Saying that both had acted well, Ng hoped that viewers would be forgiving towards Wong and be able to differentiate between work and personal life.</p>
      <p>Asked if indeed there was going to be a sequel of the series and whether he hoped to have Wong to be part of the cast, Ng said:</p>
      <p>“Hopefully. It will be a good thing.”</p>
      <p>Wong has been in the spotlight ever since she was caught kissing Hong Kong singer and actor Andy Hui in a taxi earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Cheung said he hoped there would be a sequel as he wanted to learn more from the many senior cast who are part of the series.</p>
      <p>He also praised Wong, saying that she was very hardworking.</p>
      <p>As to Wong’s recent Instagram post that voiced concern that her scandal may affect the series, Cheung said:</p>
      <p>“I heard from people that she has apologised but I feel she need not do so as the series has been aired and the response has been good. Hopefully she will stop blaming herself and everyone give her some space.”</p>
      <p>Wong had earlier this week through her Instagram expressed her worries that her scandal would affect the television series she acted in.</p>
      <p>She also expressed her happiness that <i>Finding Her Voice</i> was finally aired without any changes despite earlier speculation that it would be re-shot.</p>
