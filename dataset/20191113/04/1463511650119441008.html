      <h1>Oshiomhole devalued to local factional leader — DG, APC Governors’ Forum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:55:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:55</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Director General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, has described the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, as having been devalued to a local factional leader from a national hero looked up to by many.</p>
      <p>The PGF is the umbrella body of Governors elected on the platform of the APC.</p>
      <p>Lukman, in an article shortly after Oshiomhole was suspended by the Edo State chapter of the APC on Tuesday, said it was sad that the former Labour leader had reduced himself to local politics instead of paying attention to issues that could better the lot of the party nationally.</p>
      <p>He accused Oshiomhole of failure to show leadership in the running of the APC, adding that the organs of the party had either been suspended or weakened under him.</p>
      <p>He said the former Governor of Edo State had failed to convene the meeting of the highest organ of the party, the National Executive Committee, to resolve issues confronting it.</p>
      <p>He said the last time the NEC met was in August 2018.</p>
      <p>He said the National Working Committee, which could also have saved the party, has some of its members suspended or now occupying other political offices.</p>
      <p>Lukman said if care is not taken, the party will sink further with Oshiomhole at the helm of affairs.</p>
      <p>He said the way the party lost the elections in Zamfara, Rivers and others during the last general election could be replicated in upcoming governorship elections in Edo and Rivers State.</p>
      <p>Below is the full article:</p>
      <p>APC and our Inconceivable Organisational Challenges: Urgent Call to our Leaders</p>
      <p>Salihu Moh. Lukman</p>
      <p>Progressive Governors Forum</p>
      <p>79 Nelson Mandela Street</p>
      <p>Asokoro, Abuja</p>
      <p>Information coming from Edo State indicate that members of the State Executive Council of APC have passed vote of no confidence on Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of our party, APC. In so many respects, it could be argued, it is a natural outcome of unfolding power play between Comrade Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki since June 2019 with the contentious inauguration of the Edo State House of Assembly. Possible retaliatory response from both Comrade Oshiomhole and groups such as Edo Peoples Movement who are loyal to Comrade Oshiomhole should be expected. In other words, the could be counter pronouncement suspending Governor Obaseki.</p>
      <p>Side by side with the news of the vote of no confidence was also the discomforting report of the Federal High Court judgement in Abuja disqualifying Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo as our Deputy Governorship candidate for the November 16, 2019 Bayelsa election. While expecting that every necessary step will be taken to vacate the judgement, it is very depressing for every committed party member to be subjected to such ignominious reality, which only remind us of our reckless conducts in states like Zamfara, Rivers, Bauchi and Adamawa, which chiefly gave away electoral victories to PDP.</p>
      <p>Instead of focusing on working to win elections, we are busy undermining ourselves. All these are ominous signs that we are about to re-enact the Zamfara, Rivers, Bauchi and Adamawa experiences in Bayelsa. It is Bayelsa today, Anambra, Edo and Ondo are being setup for similar experiences. Somehow, unfortunately, the National Executive Council (NEC) of the party, which is the organ vested with the statutory responsibility of responding to all these challenges appear to be suspended. The last time it met was August 2018. In its place, the National Working Committee (NWC), which is an administrative organ with the responsibility of implementing decisions of NEC and other higher organs seems to have usurped the powers of NEC.</p>
      <p>Sadly, even the NWC, as at today, is a shadow of itself, as it has lost many members either on accounts of appointment into government or controversial suspension. For instance, Otumba Niyi Adebayo, Deputy National Chairman (South), is today a Minister of the Federal Republic. Senator Lawal Shuaibu, Deputy National Chairman (North) ,is allegedly suspended. Alhaji Inuwa Abdulkadir, National Vice Chairman (North West), is similarly suspended.</p>
      <p>We may recall that in June 2019, the NWC allegedly suspended Governor Rotimi Akeredolu SAN. During the 2019 general elections, on accounts of the roles of former Governors Rochas Okorocha and Ibikunle Amosun against the candidates of the party, they were similarly suspended. Whether all these actions are permissible by provisions of the APC’s constitution is highly contestable.</p>
      <p>Why should all these be allowed to happen? Why is it impossible to convene a NEC or even National Caucus meetings, which are supposed to hold every quarter to resolve all these issues? Why should the NWC under Comrade Oshiomhole continue to imagine that it can conduct affairs of the party without mandatory meetings of party organs? What legacy is Comrade Oshiomhole hoping to achieve as a National Chairman by running the party in a way that suggests almost zero commitment to issues of party development?</p>
      <p>It is very painful for many of us who have had the privilege of being mentored by Comrade Oshiomhole to see him being devalued to a local factional leader from a very high pedestal of an illustrious national leader. As National Chairman, Comrade Oshiomhole hardly appreciate that he now has a national constituency and not just a state constituency, which may have been responsible for his apparent intemperance in the handling of matters affecting Edo State. I wish he paid similar attention to handling of issues affecting Rivers and Zamfara states during the 2019 elections.</p>
      <p>In the current circumstance, nothing short of a NEC or National Caucus meeting of the party can resolve all our increasing organisational challenges as a party. It is either Comrade Oshiomhole respect the provision of party constitution and convene superior organ meeting to deliberate on all our challenges, or he should just accept his inability to manage the party and simply resign.</p>
      <p>Our national leaders must rise to the challenge facing us as a party and take all necessary measures to convene superior organ meetings to begin to resolve all our challenges as a party. The current public disgrace must end!</p>
