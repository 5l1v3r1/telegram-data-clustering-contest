      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few days, ripple followed a bearish path below the $0.2900 resistance area against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP/USD settled below the key $0.2800 area and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>It opened the doors for more downsides below the $0.2750 support area. Recently, the price traded below the last swing low near $0.2680 and declined below $0.2670. A new monthly low was formed near $0.2668 and the price is currently correcting higher.</p>
      <p>It broke the $0.2700 and $0.2710 resistance levels. Additionally, ripple climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.2758 high to $0.2668 low.</p>
      <p>However, the price seems to be facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the $0.2740 and $0.2750 levels. More importantly, this week’s crucial bearish trend line is intact with resistance near $0.2800 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.2758 high to $0.2668 low is also acting as a resistance. Therefore, a clear break above the $0.2740 and $0.2750 resistance levels is needed for more gains in the near term.</p>
      <p>Once there is a clear break above $0.2750 and the 100 hourly SMA, the price could recover towards the $0.2820 and $0.2850 resistance levels. On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.2660 level. If the bulls fail to defend the $0.2660 and $0.2650 support levels, the next stop for the bears may perhaps be $0.2620.</p>
