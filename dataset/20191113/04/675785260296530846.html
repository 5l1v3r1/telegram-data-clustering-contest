      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:04:11+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:04</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Dan Whitcomb, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A 17-year-old boy is lucky to be alive after becoming the first patient with a vaping-related illness to undergo a double lung transplant.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Henry Ford Hospital, in Detroit, US, said the youngster faced 'imminent death' if he did not have surgery.</p>
      <p>Doctors have shared his ordeal a day after President <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> announced plans to meet representatives from the vaping industry to discuss regulation.</p>
      <p>A string of vaping-related illnesses and deaths has resulted in certain types of e-cigarettes being banned in some US states, including Oregon and Washington.</p>
      <p>Dr Hassan Nemeh, surgical director of thoracic organ transplant at Henry Ford Hospital, said he and two other surgeons operated on the 17-year-old in October.</p>

      <p>Family members of the boy, who was not identified by name, said in the statement that they had asked the hospital to share their story to raise awareness about the "horrific life-threatening effects" of vaping.</p>
      <p>One relative said: "Within a very short period of time, our lives have been forever changed.</p>
      <p>"(The boy) has gone from the typical life of a perfectly healthy 16-year old athlete ... to waking up intubated and with two new lungs, facing a long and painful recovery process as he struggles to regain his strength and mobility, which has been severely impacted."</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported there had been 2,051 confirmed and probable US lung injury cases and 39 deaths associated with e-cigarettes or vaping products.</p>
      <p>Nearly 85 per cent of lung injury patients in the nationwide outbreak have reported using products containing THC, the substance in marijuana that gets people high.</p>
      <p>However it was not clear if a THC-product was used by the Detroit patient.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the CDC said that lung samples taken from 29 patients with vaping-related injuries suggest all contained Vitamin E acetate, a discovery they hailed as a "breakthrough" in the investigation.</p>

      <p>The Michigan boy was admitted to St John's Hospital in Detroit on September 5 with what appeared to be pneumonia and was intubated a week later as his ability to breathe worsened, doctors at Henry Ford said.</p>
      <p>He arrived at Henry Ford on October 3 critically ill and suffering such severe lung damage that he was placed at the top of the list for a transplant, which was performed on October 15, according to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The young patient was given a "very good prognosis," Henry Ford said, although he faces a long recovery.</p>
