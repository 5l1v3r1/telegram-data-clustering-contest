        <b>The bank's former CIO of retail banking and business banking division Adam Bennett will move on to "pursue the next phase of his career" at the end of January 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has announced the departure of the bank's Business and Private Banking group executive Adam Bennett. <br/><br/>According to the bank's CEO Matt Comyn, Bennett will officially finish up at the end of January 2020 to "pursue the next phase of his career". <br/><br/>"Adam is a highly respected leader whose banking and technology expertise has helped deliver many innovative digital solutions for our customers, including the Bank's first generation mobile banking app, our market-leading NetBank and CommBiz digital platforms, and BizExpress, our new simplified business lending proposition," he said. <br/><br/>Bennett was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/commonwealth-bank-bolsters-banking-unit-with-tech-exec/">appointed to the executive team</a> back in 2014 by then-CEO Ian Narev to help the bank improve and grow its business and private banking unit. <br/><br/>Bennett initially joined the bank as part of the group technology unit in 2004, and was the chief information officer for the retail banking and business banking divisions during the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/commbank-dives-into-580m-banking-it-revamp/">core modernisation project</a>. Bennett then went on to join the private banking leadership team in 2009, and became the executive general manager of the local banking business in 2012.</p>
      <p>At the time, Narev said Bennett's experience in technology was going to help build on the Commonwealth Bank's investment in technology. <br/><br/><b>See also: <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/leaders-tout-techs-role-in-hr-and-the-need-for-corporate-purpose-at-work-awesome-conference/">Leaders tout tech's role in HR and the need for corporate purpose at Work Awesome conference</a></b> <b>(TechRepublic)</b></p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Comyn also announced Mike Vacy-Lyle will be Bennett's replacement. Vacy-Lyle is currently serving as the CEO of FNB Commercial Banking, a division of FirstRand Banking Group in South Africa, and has held other roles in commercial banking, including finance, pricing, product, capital management, and sales. <br/><br/>"He has a proven track record in delivering customer solutions across all business bank lending, agribusiness and corporate financial services, as well as meeting the needs of private banking clients. I am delighted that Mike is joining the executive leadership team," he said.<br/><br/>Last month, the bank said it is committed to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/commonwealth-bank-to-spend-over-au5b-on-tech-in-the-next-five-years/">spend AU$5 billion on technology</a> in the next five years to improve its systems and services. <br/><br/>Comyn said at the time that being "best in digital" would continue to be a key part of company's strategy. <br/><br/>"With 7 million active digital customers and 7.4 million logons per day, we're doing all we can to make banking more personalised and more convenient," he said. <br/><br/>He also said, just last week while <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/commonwealth-bank-focused-on-innovating-amid-pressure-from-fintechs/">facing the House Standing Committee Economics</a>, that the bank is "extremely focused" on making sure that there is very little innovation for fintechs to bring to the market that CBA hasn't already brought forward.   </p>
