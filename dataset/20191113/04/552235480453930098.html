      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/money/five-reasons-pays-join-credit-20577033">credit union</a> boss who forged friends’ signatures on bogus loan applications and embezzled £180,000 has been jailed for two years.</p>
      <p>Anne Costello, 67, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/mums-fury-treated-like-criminal-20847762">hatched a plot</a> to pocket thousands from the Cumbernauld South Credit Union after falling into debt.</p>
      <p>Costello, of Cumbernauld, used her senior position to make false <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/entrepreneur-behind-shetland-space-centre-20849499">applications for loans</a> but failed to deposit money into accounts.</p>

      <p>Her deception continued for 18 years but it unravelled after she took £77,000 from John Martin, 79, who she met at a mutual friend’s house.</p>
      <p>His suspicious daughters confronted shamed Costello and she admitted taking the cash but begged them not to report it.</p>
      <p>But police were called in and a probe discovered she also embezzled £39,095 from Lorraine Febers, 68, £19,298 from Anne Daly, £3588.77 from Anne Provan, 66, and £1232.83 from Marrion Cassidy, 77, who were all friends.</p>
      <p>Airdrie Sheriff Court also heard she used forged details of Martin, Yvonne Murray and Carissa Bovill to apply for bogus loans totalling more than £40,000.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Costello admitted charges of embezzlement and forgery between October 1999 and June 2017 totalling £180,718.77.</p>
      <p>Jailing Costello, sheriff Derek O’Carroll said: “You put yourself in a senior position to exploit the trust placed in you by those in your community.”</p>
