      <h1>Google’s ARCore now supports the Realme X2/Pro, OPPO Reno 2, LG G8X, and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:59:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Google’s ARCore (now <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-play-services-for-ar-rog-phone-ii-redmi-k20-pro-xperia-5-realme-5-galaxy-a50s-a90-tab-s6/">Google Play Services for AR</a>) is an SDK that allows developers to add augmented reality features to apps. While it doesn’t require any specialized hardware, Google still has to work with OEMs to create custom calibration profiles for each device. Since each device has a different camera and sensor setup, getting the calibration correct is crucial for the AR features to work properly. Over the last few months, Google has whitelisted a number of new devices to support ARCore and now the company has added the Realme X2/X2 Pro, OPPO Reno 2, LG G8X, and more to the list.</p>
      <p>The following devices have been added to Google ARCore <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-arcore-realme-5-pro-xt-support-augmented-reality/">since our last coverage</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LG G8X ThinQ</li>
        <li>LG Q70</li>
        <li>OPPO F11 Pro</li>
        <li>OPPO K5</li>
        <li>OPPO Reno 2</li>
        <li>OPPO Reno 2 Z</li>
        <li>Realme X2</li>
        <li>Realme X2 Pro</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can view the full list of ARCore supported devices by following <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices">this link</a>. If your device is on the list, you’ll be able to download Google Play Services for AR from the Play Store and start using any apps that use the AR SDK. There are a number of useful AR apps on the Play Store that you can try right away. For instance, you can try Pokémon Go’s AR+ mode for an even more realistic Pokémon catching experience or Google’s own <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.tango.measure">Measure app</a> to take accurate measurements of objects around you.</p>
