      <h1>Brides-to-be, avoid these hair mistakes before your big day!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">TNN</a></address>
      <p>If you’re a bride-to-be, it’s essential to get your bridal look planned to the T. And when it comes to bridal hairdos, there are few things to keep in mind to look your best. Here are some common mistakes brides make when it comes to their hair:</p>
      <p>
        <b>NOT TAKING A TRIAL BEFOREHAND</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pooja Singh, national creative director at a hair salon chain, says, “It is imperative for a bride to get a makeup and hairstyle trial before the wedding day. All styling and makeup trials should be done a week before so that any changes, if required, can be corrected. Ideally, she should show the outfits of wedding ceremonies to the makeup and hair stylist so that they can advise on the makeup and hair colour accordingly.”</p>
      <p><b>WASHING YOUR HAIR ON YOUR WEDDING DAY</b> Considering that you are wearing your hair in an elaborate hairdo, dirty hair will actually help the hairstyle stay in place as compared to freshly washed hair. So, wash your hair two days in advance and, if you’re the type who needs to wash their hair daily, opt for a dry shampoo instead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>GETTING A HEAVILY LAYERED HAIRCUT</b>
      </p>
      <p>“A bride-to-be should keep in mind that she would not be leaving her hair open for all the functions. Hence, avoid getting heavily layered blunt haircuts too close to the wedding,” says Savio John Pereira, celebrity hairstylist. “Stay away from bangs and fringes in general, unless you are ready to sport the fringe for all the occasions,” he adds.</p>
      <p>
        <b>GETTING HAIR COLOURED AT THE LAST MOMENT</b>
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to your mane, it’s tempting to colour your hair by opting for highlights or balayage colour treatments to get a new look or cover a few greys. However, don’t wait till the very last moment. “It’s advisable that one should colour their hair at least 15 days to a month in advance as it takes time for the colour to settle,” says Zaara Kazi, Style Director at a Salon and Spa.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NOT CHOOSING THE RIGHT FLOWERS FOR YOUR HAIRSTYLE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ever since Anushka Sharma sported roses in her bridal hairdo, the internet’s obsessed with the look. If you’re using flowers, speak to a florist on which ones will last long, and not wilt during the day or due to harsh lights. Store your flowers in the fridge to keep them looking fresh and take them out just when you’re hairdo is getting finished.</p>
