        <b>A former long-standing NHS chief executive has taken over the NHS Leadership Academy as interim lead.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Andrew Foster was chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Foundation Trust for 12 years before retiring from his role last month. Prior to that, he spent five years as director general for workforce at the Department of Health.</p>
      <p>Stephen Hart, who was previously the managing director of the NHS Leadership Academy, is understood to have left his position. He joined Health Education England and the NHS Leadership Academy in 2016 after the academy became part of HEE the year before.</p>
      <p>The academy moved from HEE to become part of NHSE/I in April.</p>
      <p>Prerana Issar, chief people officer at NHS England and Improvement, told <i>HSJ</i> she was “delighted” to welcome Mr Foster to the team and added: “We will continue to work together to develop and support the NHS’ leaders of the future, as outlined in the long-term plan.”</p>
      <p>It was <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/long-standing-chief-exec-hired-to-deliver-nhs-workforce-plan/7025613.article">previously announced in July</a> that Mr Foster would be brought in to work on NHSE/I’s “NHS People Plan”, in particular how to “better support hard-working NHS leaders”.</p>
      <p>The plan had been due to be published by the end of the year but, due to the general election and other political factors, is now expected in January.</p>
