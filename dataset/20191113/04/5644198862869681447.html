      <p>LOS ANGELES: Tiger Woods confirmed on Tuesday (Nov 12) he will play in next year's Genesis Invitational tournament in Los Angeles as the event showcases its elevated status for the first time.</p>
      <p>The tournament at Riviera Country Club holds special significance for Woods, who made his PGA Tour debut at the event in 1992 as a 16-year-old amateur.</p>

      <p>Previously known as the Genesis Open, the tournament, which is run by Woods' charitable foundation, was boosted to invitational status last year.</p>
      <p>The change grants the winner a three-year tour exemption, gives the tournament a higher purse, and reduces the field from 144 players to 120.</p>
      <p>The new-look competition will be similar to the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, hosted by Palmer before his death in 2016, and Jack Nicklaus's Memorial Tournament.</p>
      <p>"It's an honour for us to be in the same category as Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer," tournament host Woods said.</p>
      <p>"Those are two legends of the game. For us to have this type of elevation, all the things we want to have happen for the tournament are going to happen.</p>
      <p>"On top of that, to be able to host the tournament each and every year at Riviera, where it all started for me, it's come full circle."</p>
      <p>Woods' participation comes after a successful 2019 which saw him seal a dramatic fifth victory at the Masters in April before capturing an 82nd career PGA Tour win.</p>
