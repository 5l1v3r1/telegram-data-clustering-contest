      <h1>Andy Murray reveals son's unusual name chosen by wife Kim</h1>
      <h2>The double Wimbledon champion said that his wife Kim chose the name after immediately falling in love with it.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-murray">Andy Murray</a> has revealed his new son is called Teddy – and his wife Kim chose the name.</p>
      <p>But the double <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> champion’s third child will have his middle name Barron from the Scottish side of his family, even though the tennis star is not a fan of it.</p>
      <p>Murray, 32, said: “The middle name got in there. I don’t actually love the name. My dad’s middle name was Barron, his dad was Barron, my granddad’s dad, so I kept that. But Teddy, my wife liked that so she chose it.”</p>
      <p>Teddy was born in London last month, just days after Murray’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tennis/emotional-andy-murray-stuns-stan-20658669">comeback win</a> at the European Open in Antwerp. He joins his sisters Sophia, three, and Edie, one, plus border terriers Rusty and Maggie in the growing family.</p>
      <p>Three-time major winner Murray added: “We’ve got three under four now and two dogs, so you’ve got to keep an eye out all the time, but it’s been good, sleeping fine.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s healthy. This time the girls have been really good actually. The first time when we went from one to two the first week or so was a bit, I don’t know, a bit of jealousy. But this time they’ve been brilliant. One more for mixed doubles? I hope not.”</p>
      <p>Murray, who plays in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-named-great-britains-20665929">Davis Cup</a> in Madrid next week, was talking at the launch of his Andy Murray Castore clothing line in London.</p>
