      <p>A blast outside the police headquarters in the Indonesian city of Medan in North Sumatra was a suspected suicide bombing, a police spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Tatan Dirsan Atmaja, a spokesman for the North Sumatra police, said some police officers had been wounded in the blast that occurred at 8:40am (0140 GMT) and that the suspected suicide bomber had died in the attack.</p>
      <p>A number of Indonesian television channels showed footage of people rushing out of buildings around the headquarters.</p>

      <p>The motive for Wednesday's attack was not immediately clear, but <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/indonesia.html">Indonesia,</a> the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, has suffered a resurgence in homegrown militancy in recent years, with some attacks aimed at the police.</p>
      <p>National police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo said the blast happened in a car park near an area where people were queueing for clearance letters from police.</p>
      <p>"We're on alert right now," Prasetyo told Kompas TV. "The explosion didn't reach the centre for the clearance letter service, it was just in a parking lot."</p>
      <p>In recent years, Islamic fighters, including the outlawed Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a homegrown Indonesian armed group linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS). have staged a series of attacks against the police.</p>
      <p>The latest bombing comes a month after a suspected fighter <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/isil-linked-indonesia-group-blamed-attack-wiranto-191011010351439.html">stabbed and wounded Wiranto</a>, who was Indonesia's security minister at the time.</p>
