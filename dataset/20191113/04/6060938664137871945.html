      <p>MUMBAI: While millennials, who have been driving <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/credit-demand">credit demand</a> by a large margin in the past two years, in what can potentially raise concerns for lenders, most of them have been taking the riskier unsecured loans, warns a report.</p>
      <p>The number of millennials -- those born after 1980 -- opting for a new loan grew 58 per cent as against a 14 per cent growth in the non-millennial segment, a study by credit bureau TransUnion- Cibil said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Lenders are increasingly depending on the retail segment for their <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/loan-growth">loan growth</a> as its quality is better than the corporate segment which is shying away from investing having already sitting with bloated balance-sheets.</p>
      <p>There have also been concerns raised about the financial behaviour of the millennial segment, especially if there are over-leveraging in the process and those raising such flags are pointing to the dipping national savings rate.</p>
      <p>In what displays increasing consumption-oriented tendencies in this segment, the Cibil study said unsecured loans consisting of credit cards, personal loans and consumer durable loans contribute 72 per cent of the millennials' credit requirements.</p>
      <p>As compared to this, the secured loans of two-wheeler and auto loans consisted of only 9 per cent of the millennials' credit appetite, the study said.</p>
      <p>However, it what can assuage the concerns, the bureau report said the millennial segment is more conscious about their credit scores, as they believe in self-monitoring and the average is 740 out of 900.</p>
      <p>Millennials in Gujarat have the highest average score of 747, followed by Haryana at 743 and Rajasthan at 742, it said.</p>
      <p>The bureau also said that millennials have a tendency to correct their behaviour, as 51 per cent of them with a score of less than 700 improved their scores within six months of checking their scores by an average of 65 points.</p>
