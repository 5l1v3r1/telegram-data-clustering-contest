      <h2>The owner wasn’t aware it was a rare Chinese artefact from the 1700s.</h2>

      <p>A teapot sitting on a shelf as an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/family-kids/child-pet-proof-christmas-tree-20861413">ornament</a> has sold for £1million.</p>
      <p>The owner wasn’t aware it was a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cuddly-coo-mystery-solved-750-16671563">rare</a> Chinese artefact from the 1700s.</p>
      <p>He took it down to show expert Lee Young, who was invited to his property to look at some items.</p>

      <p>Lee identified the stamp on the base of the 5in-tall china pot as being that of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-official-detained-china-sent-18973384">Chinese</a> emperor Qianlong, who reigned between 1735 and 1796.</p>
      <p>The green glaze pear-shaped teapot, which has a peach on the lid, was estimated to go for a couple of thousand but there was an international bidding war.</p>
      <p>Guy Schwinge, from Duke’s auction house in Dorchester, Dorset, said the lucky seller, who lives in the county, “is understandably delighted”.</p>
      <p>Lee, the firm’s Asian art specialist and an Antiques Roadshow expert, was doing a routine valuation.</p>
      <p>Schwinge said: “The vendor brought it down for him and Lee sensed straight away it was a rather exciting discovery.”</p>
      <p>There was stunned applause at the auction as the hammer went down at £800,000.</p>
      <p>The phone bidder paid £1,040,000 after fees were added.</p>
