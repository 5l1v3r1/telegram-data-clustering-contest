      <p>INDORE: " <i>Pink ball dekha kya</i> (have you seen the pink ball?)," one net bowler asked another during a refreshment break after Bangladesh's net session.</p>
      <p>There are still nine days left before India and Bangladesh play their maiden Day/Night Test, and more importantly, there's a Test match, which is a part of the World Test Championship, to be played at the Holkar Stadium from Thursday.</p>
      <p>However, all the buzz before the first Test of this series centres around the pink ball. "What does it look like? How does it behave? Is its seam prominent or would it spin enough?" Questions like these floated around on Tuesday, as both the teams had their first hit here.</p>
      <p>Some members of the Indian team have already had a feel of the pink ball during a special practice session at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, under the guidance of batting legend <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ramachandra-Guha">Rahul Dravid</a>, who now heads the NCA. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajinkya-Rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cheteshwar-Pujara">Cheteshwar Pujara</a>, Mohammad Shami and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ravindra-jadeja">Ravindra Jadeja</a> had two practice sessions - one during day and the other under lights.</p>

      <p>Naturally, as soon as he walked in for the press conference, Rahane, the Test team's vice-captain, was asked multiple queries on his first experience with the pink SG ball.</p>
      <p>"It was exciting. It was the first time I played with the pink ball. It's definitely a different ball game as compared to the red ball. Our focus was to look into the swing and seam (of the ball) and also play close to our body. What we found out at the practice session was that the pink ball does a lot more than the red ball. We have to play slightly late and close to the body," Rahane said.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday afternoon, one witnessed the strange sight of Team India players training with both the red and pink ball simultaneously. Skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> went to the adjacent nets to have a feel of the pink ball before getting back to batting against the red ball. Almost all the batsmen, barring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> (he'll join the team from Wednesday) took throwdowns with the pink ball from India's throwdown specialists Raghavindraa, popularly known as Raghu, and Nuwan Seneviratne could be seen giving practice to Indian batsmen, though only for a brief period.</p>

      <p>Rahane justified Team India's early rehearsals with the pink ball. "We had to practice with the pink ball because we were not playing T20s or any other format. What we decided was to go and spend time at the NCA and if we can get pink ball session, it will be great. It's not difficult to stay in the present. Our focus is on the Indore Test first and then we'll think about the Kolkata pink ball Test. As a team, it is important to forget how well we played against South Africa. It's in the past. It's important to be in the present. Think about this match, think about the Bangladesh team," Rahane said.</p>
      <p>The feedback from the Duleep Trophy, where the pink ball was tried from 2016-18, was that spinners didn't get much help. However, while pointing out that the Duleep Trophy was played with the Kookaburra ball, Rahane said that the tweakers got good revs on the SG pink ball, which will be used in the Kolkata Test.</p>
