      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/celtic-boys-club-paedo-frank-18942937">evil beast</a> is to make his latest bid for freedom on tomorrow at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>He is appealing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ex-celtic-boys-club-coach-18335183">his convictions</a> despite the eight brave victims who independently took the stand at Hamilton Sheriff Court to give evidence against him.</p>

      <p>Now, one of them has told the Daily Record how he is “insulted” and “disgusted” by  Cairney’s constant appeals, saying they “prolong suffering” for the victims who were abused over a 20-year period.</p>
      <p>Cairney was jailed for four years in February on nine charges of historical abuse by Sheriff Daniel Kelly QC, who said he used his role as manager of the club as a “sinister cover” to carry out his sexual abuse of children and that he was a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”.</p>
      <p>The victim, who cannot be named, said: “It is totally cynical. I am insulted and disgusted by Cairney’s behaviour.</p>
      <p>“I have had to suffer all my life for what he did to me 45 years ago. I would expect that the other seven victims feel the same.</p>

      <p>“Giving evidence and having to see his face at the trial was a horrible experience. I wake up every night with the image of him in my head, several months on.</p>
      <p>“If that is not enough for any human being to have to go through, leaving me badly traumatised, Cairney keeps the ball rolling and prolongs my suffering by appealing four times and putting me through a complete state of anxiety and fear at the slightest chance he is going to get out of jail soon.</p>
      <p>“He is not man enough to accept or even acknowledge the damage he has done to me, and so continues to put me through further suffering, making it impossible for me to try and live a normal life.</p>

      <p>“Is this his way of tormenting me further, for standing up to him, at last, in a court of law, with seven more innocent children who were within his evil grasp?</p>
      <p>“I’ve spent my life silenced by the fear of ‘Big Frank’ and the power of Celtic Football Club.</p>
      <p>“Why, after being found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, due to the courage of us eight victims, doesn’t he accept his light punishment for his predatory, evil, sexual abuse over decades? Just tell the truth like it is.</p>
      <p>“Big Frank, you were part of an evil paedophile ring, pouncing on young boy’s hopes and dreams.”</p>

      <p>Cairney’s lawyers have tried on two occasions to have him released from prison ahead of the appeal because of his apparent poor health. However, judges have refused to grant the requests. Lord Turnbull and Lord Drummond Young concluded there was not enough evidence to justify Cairney, 84, being granted interim liberation.</p>
      <p>Cairney is thought to be serving time at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow’s east end.</p>
      <p>At his sentencing, Sheriff Kelly told Cairney: “At Celtic Boys’ Club, you had a great say in which of the young men would progress to being taken on by Celtic Football Club.</p>
      <p>“A wolf in sheep’s clothing, little did parents suspect that the revered football manager was in fact an active paedophile.”</p>
      <p>Cairney is one of four men associated with Celtic Boys’ Club or Celtic FC to be convicted of predatory paedophile behaviour in recent months.</p>
      <p>Former kitman Jim McCafferty, 73, was jailed for six years and nine months.</p>
      <p>Founder of the boys’ club Jim Torbett, 71, was jailed for two years in 1998, and then again for six years last November.</p>
      <p>Gerald King, 66, a former chairman of the boys’ club, was convicted of preying on young victims while a teacher in Glasgow but avoided jail.</p>
