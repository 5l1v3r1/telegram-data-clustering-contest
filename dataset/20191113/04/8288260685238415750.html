      <h3>WEST HAM URGED TO LURE NUNO AWAY FROM WOLVES</h3>

      <p>Premier League side West Ham have been urged to "try" and lure manager Nuno Espirito Santo away from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> .</p>
      <p>That is the view of talkSPORT host Adrian Durham, who claims that the Hammers should increase their ambition and bring a new manager in to replace Manuel Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>West Ham have had a tough start to the season, amassing just 13 points from their opening 16 Premier League fixtures and are in 16th place in the table and five points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Wolves are having a better campaign than the Hammers so far, with Nuno’s side three points better off in the league and are also on course to reach the knockout stages of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Nuno is currently in his third season in Molineux hotseat, and Durham believes he would be a better fit for West Ham than current boss Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>Durham also suggested that the Hammers “try” and bring in Jose Mourinho, who is currently out of work after being sacked by Manchester United in December last year.</p>

      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are reportedly set to compete with a number of clubs for the signing of Atalanta youngster Dejan Kulusevski.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/sport/19_novembre_12/atalanta-mercato-kulusevski-gennaio-puo-gia-partire-pole-l-inter-85bd7e10-052e-11ea-a1df-d75c93ec44da.shtml?refresh_ce-cp">reports in Italy</a> , <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> will battle with Manchester United and Southampton for the 19-year-old’s signature during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Italian giants Inter Milan are the club thought to be the most interested in Kulusevski’s signature, but do face competition from the aforementioned English clubs.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It is also believed that those clubs are ready to offer €17-€18m to sign Kulusevski, although that is a figure Atalanta would reject as they would prefer €25m for the player.</p>

      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are once again being linked with a move for AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been widely tipped to head for the exit door at the San Siro, with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> claimed to be a potential destination.</p>
      <p>Fresh <a href="http://tuttosport.com/">reports in Italy</a> claim that Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham have all shown an interest in acquiring Kessie’s signature, but adds that Wolves are “above everyone” because of their relationship with Milan.</p>
      <p>Wolves signed striker Patrick Cutrone from the Italian outfit in the summer, and it is believed the two clubs are on good terms following the deal.</p>
      <p>It is also being claimed that Kessie’s exit could be accelerated to make way for Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic.</p>
