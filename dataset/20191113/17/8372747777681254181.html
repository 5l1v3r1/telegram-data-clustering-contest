      <p>PUNTA GORDA, Fla. â€” At the Babcock Neighborhood School in Punta Gorda, some students might look like they're just having fun creating and building various items.</p>
      <p>But educators here tell Fox 4 they're using robotics 3-d printing, coding, and project-based learning to encourage students to solve challenges.</p>
      <p>One student says the skills she's learned inside of this classroom, also known as the school's "make tank," go beyond the classroom.</p>
