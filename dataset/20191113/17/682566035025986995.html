      <p>London - <b>Raheem Sterling's </b>altercation with<b> England</b> team-mate <b>Joe Gomez </b>could have been sparked by a delayed reaction to the hatred aimed at the striker by Liverpool fans in their P<b>remier League</b> clash last Sunday said <b>Danny Rose</b>.</p>
      <p>Sterling, who has been a target for Liverpool fans since his leaving for Manchester City in 2015, has been dropped for Thursday's Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro by Gareth Southgate after physically confronting Liverpool full-back Gomez at the England training centre on Monday.</p>
      <p>Sterling apologised and said his emotions got the better of him in the wake of the 3-1 defeat at Anfield which left defending champions City nine points adrift of the victors and league leaders.</p>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur star Rose, who is also in the England squad, said watching the match on Sunday had alerted him to the visceral antipathy to Sterling.</p>
      <p>"It's probably the first time I have sat back and actually realised and took note of how much the Liverpool fans dislike him," Rose told BBC Radio.</p>
      <p>"I think he just gets on with it and maybe it had a part to play in whatever happened."</p>
      <p>Rose said he hoped the matter would be soon forgotten.</p>
      <p>"We have moved on," Rose said.</p>
      <p>"But I hope it can be put to bed as soon as possible because obviously Joe is -- and I'm not just saying this -- one of the nicest people I have come across in football.</p>
      <p>"He won't want this to fester and Raheem won't want this to fester."</p>
      <p>Southgate spoke on Tuesday of the squad being like a family and Rose reflected this by saying both players made heartfelt apologies in front of the other players.</p>
      <p>"You could sense that (Sterling's apology was from the heart) and you could hear that," said Rose.</p>
      <p>"Joe spoke afterwards and we were all proud of what they said. We are just happy that everyone has woken up in a better mood this morning."</p>
      <p>Rose said unlike what some from previous eras have said it is possible to have friendships with players from other clubs.</p>
      <p>Rose said they were "friendships and relationships forged throughout the years", citing his own relationship with Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, players formerly at Spurs' north London rivals Arsenal.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I'd like to think that everybody knows if I ever played against them, then my will to win for my team will always override any friendships or relationships, but when I come here for England it is all put to one side," he said.</p>
