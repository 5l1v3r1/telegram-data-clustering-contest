      <h1>Gemma Collins' CBB pal brands her 'a nightmare' who 'gets on his nerves'</h1>
      <h2>The GC and Jonathan Cheban have had a falling out…</h2>

      <p>They were last seen <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins-visits-cosmetic-surgeon-to-get-fat-sucked-out-of-her-face/">swanning around in the sunshine on her show Diva Forever</a>.</p>
      <p>However, after having an argument on screen, Jonathan Cheban has revealed what he really thinks of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/">Gemma Collins</a>.</p>
      <p>The pair met in 2016 during their stint in the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/big-brother/">Celebrity Big Brother</a> house.</p>

      <p>And, while their friendship had been going from strength to strength, Jonathan said things haven't been the same since filming ended.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.new-magazine.co.uk/">New!</a>: "We did have a big argument. It's been a little different since then and I haven't seen her since. We've spoken a little bit, but it hasn't been the same."</p>
      <aside>We fell out because she's a nightmare. There's only room for one diva here.</aside>
      <p>Claiming that they "can't resist" each other when they do see each other, we're not sure that'll remain the same once Gemma reads his next comments.</p>

      <p>He said: "She's pure entertainment but she's a f**king diva and she gets on my nerves. We fell out because she's a nightmare. There's only room for one diva here."</p>
      <p>He also revealed he has "no idea" what's going on with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/james-arg-argent-and-gemma-collins-get-back-together-again-as-they-jet-off-on-romantic-dubai-holiday/">Gemma and on/off boyfriend James Argent</a>.</p>

      <p>"I love Arg – I love the fact he can handle her. But he has his own problems and I don't think Gemma can deal with that right now. She doesn't need to be held down by anyone."</p>
      <p>Last night, Gemma stepped out on the red carpet at ITV's Palooza on her own.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/gemma-collins-shows-off-her-new-hair-on-the-itv-palooza-red-carpet/">sported a new hairstyle</a> which got the seal of approval from her fans.</p>
