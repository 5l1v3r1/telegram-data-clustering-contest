      <h1>Coronation Street SPOILERS: Geoff forces Yasmeen to 'bin clothes and stay indoors'</h1>
      <h2>He stoops to new lows in the coercive control storyline</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:24:30+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Fear</a></address>
      <p>Geoff Metcalfe's control over partner Yasmeen Nazir is set to get tighter and more disturbing in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a>, when he will force her to bin all of her favourite clothes and stay indoors cleaning, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Viewers have watched in mute horror as poor Yasmeen has been subjected to both psychological and emotional abuse at the hands of Geoff - and things have been getting progressively worse for the isolated chef.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Now, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10337056/coronation-street-yasmeen-abused-clothes-geoff-metcalfe/">The Sun Online</a>, Geoff and Yasmeen's coercive control storyline is going to take a disturbing new turn.</p>

      <p>A source said: "Yasmeen's confidence will fall to an all-time low, when Geoff forces her to get rid of all her clothes and only wear things he approves of.</p>
      <p>"He manipulates her into staying in the house under his surveillance as much as possible and starts tightening his grip on her in the most disturbing ways."</p>

      </p>
      <p>They continued: "Geoff secretly plants marks in obscure places in the house and leaves Yasmeen a list ordering her to clean the entire house.</p>
      <p>"It's an impossibly long list and he humiliates her when he arrives home and finds the dirty marks he left.</p>
      <p>"The scenes are going to be really difficult for viewers to watch but Corrie and the actors are keen to do the storyline justice."</p>

      <p>The scenes will leave viewers raging, as they have <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-beg-geoff-to-come-to-a-sticky-end-after-latest-vile-act/">grown to hate the controlling bully</a>.</p>
      <p>In scenes shown earlier this week, he <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-controlling-geoff-manipulates-yasmeen/">continued to turn the screws on poor Yasmeen</a> - turning the tables on her and accusing HER of being controlling!</p>
      <p>Slowly chipping away at her confidence, Tim's dad tricked Yasmeen into believing he had planned a romantic break away for them both to Las Vegas - only for him to 'cancel it' because of her supposedly controlling behaviour.</p>
      <p>When Yasmeen catched him browsing an online dating site, Geoff claimed he was doing research for a radio show and slammed his partner for not trusting him.</p>

      <p>Furious with Yasmeen, Geoff declared the 'trip to Vegas' was off leaving her devastated.</p>
      <p>Believing she was to blame, Yasmeen decided to make arrangements for the trip Geoff claimed he had planned for them.</p>
      <p>Soap fans have <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-want-three-major-characters-to-die/">begged scriptwriters to kill off Geoff</a>, and hate the abuse he's putting Yasmeen through.</p>
      <p>Last week, Corrie viewers were horrified when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-disgust-as-contents-of-geoffs-laptop-revealed/">Geoff was seen searching dating sites</a> for other women under Yasmeen's nose in her own house.</p>

      <p>The soap has worked closely with charities over the storyline to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-coercive-control-yasmeen-and-geoff/">raise awareness of the horror that victims of coercive control live through</a>.</p>
      <p>Teresa Parker, of Women's Aid, said: "Many people think that unless there is physical abuse, it doesn't count.</p>
      <p>"Coercive control underpins almost all abusive relationships, and Geoff has established himself at the centre of Yasmeen's life, and manipulated her in so many ways.</p>
      <p>"Gradually we are seeing the long-term effects of living with an abusive partner."</p>
