      <p>Nenad Bjelica, the Dinamo Zagreb coach hailed former Barca player Dani Olmo and says Ivan Rakitic is leaving in January on 'Què t'hi jugues', a Cadena SER radio show.</p>
      <p>"Dani Olmo is impressive as a footballer and a person, very humble and ambitious at the same time," he said. "He wants to learn every day and I'm very proud of coaching him.</p>
      <p>"I think we're seeing Dani's last games as a Dinamo Zagreb player, he has so many offers that in the end the player and the club will have to decide what's best for both parties. He's ready to play for one of the biggest sides in Europe."</p>
      <p>On Rakitic, he added: "He's had some very good seasons at Barca and has been a legend and he deserves a bit more, but it's up to the coach and Ivan. They know why he's playing less but wherever he goes he'll show what a good player he is. I think he'll go in the winter window for his own good and Barca's too."</p>
