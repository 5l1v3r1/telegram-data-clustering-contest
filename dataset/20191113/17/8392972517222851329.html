      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> have accused the soap of turning all kids 'horrible' as they get older.</p>
      <p>Over the last few weeks, viewers have seen Arthur Thomas become increasingly jealous of Archie Sharma.</p>
      <p>After Archie's mum Rachel died, he came to live in the village with his dad, Jai, who is going out with Arthur's mum, Laurel.</p>

      <p>Although Arthur and Archie seemed to get on well at first, Arthur soon turned on the little boy.</p>
      <p>In last night's episode (November 12 2019) after Archie ran off from Ashley's memorial picnic, Arthur was furious and accused Archie of ruining his dad's birthday.</p>
      <p>When Laurel asked Arthur to take Archie to play on the pirate ship, he took the little boy back to his house instead.</p>
