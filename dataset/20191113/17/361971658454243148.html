      <p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/33793-kodak-black/">Kodak Black</a> has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for lying about his criminal history while trying to purchase guns in Florida, according to the <i><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237288659.html">Miami Herald</a></i>. The maximum sentence he could have received for the federal violation was 10 years. Pitchfork has reached out to Kodak Black’s lawyers and representatives for comment.</p>
      <p>The rapper was <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-arrested-at-rolling-loud-festival-on-weapons-charges-report/">arrested on May 11</a> while en route to perform at the Rolling Loud festival. Though he was granted release on <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-granted-release-on-bond-from-federal-prison/">$550,000 bond on May 15</a>, a federal judge <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-blacks-release-from-jail-halted-judge-calls-him-a-danger-to-the-community/">revoked it</a> less than three weeks later, calling him a “a danger to the community because he wants to have access to guns.” Kodak <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-pleads-guilty-to-federal-weapons-charges/">pleaded guilty</a> to the charges in late August.</p>
      <p>Kodak was found guilty of lying while trying to purchase firearms on two separate occasions, indicating on paperwork “that he was not under indictment or information in any court for a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could imprison him for more than one year.” He had been previously indicted on <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-indicted-on-sexual-assault-charges-report/">sexual assault charges</a> in South Carolina in 2016, and was out on bond at the time of his arrest in Miami. Kodak was also <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kodak-black-arrested-at-us-border-on-drug-and-gun-charges/">arrested in mid-April</a> at the U.S.-Canada border for possession of marijuana and a firearm.</p>
