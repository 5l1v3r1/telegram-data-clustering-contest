      <h1>Andy Ruiz Jr's diet ahead of heavyweight rematch against Anthony Joshua</h1>
      <h2>Andy Ruiz Jr is set to trim down ahead of his second clash with Anthony Joshua on December 7 with a strict diet fuelling his training camp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:27:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr is looking to arrive in the shape of his life when he takes on Anthony Joshua in their huge rematch in Saudi Arabia next month.</p>
      <p>The world heavyweight champion, who stunned Joshua in New York in June, is already looking trimmed down as he aims to weigh in eight pounds lighter for their second bout.</p>
      <p>He has already showed off his new, leaner physique after being ridiculed by some ahead of his stunning win over Joshua.</p>
      <p>But a gruelling training camp is not the only thing behind his new look - there's also a strict diet ahead of the biggest fight of his life.</p>
      <p>And his personal nutritionist, Zo's Meal Plans, told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11808327/ruiz-jr-vs-joshua-ii-the-diet-that-fuels-world-heavyweight-champion-andy-ruiz-jr">Sky Sports</a> exactly what he is eating to ensure he is in the shape of his life on December 7.</p>

      <h3>Breakfast - Omelette with mushrooms, spinach and avocados, hash browns.</h3>
      <p>A big breakfast is needed to fuel Ruiz for the day ahead.</p>
      <p>This is said to be Ruiz's typical breakfast, with the egg omelette providing high-quality protein as well as vitamin D, B6 and B12 plus minerals such as zinc, iron and copper.</p>
      <p>The mushrooms offer good protein and fibre, with spinach adding iron to his diet to give him energy and avocados providing a healthy source of monounsaturated fats.</p>

      <h3>Lunch - Chicken Salad or Chicken Wrap</h3>
      <p>Chicken is a staple in Ruiz's diet, providing high protein, low fat and ideal muscle fuel.</p>
      <p>Whether he eats the meat in a salad or a wrap depends on the day - but it's almost always Ruiz's lunchtime choice.</p>
      <h3>Dinner - Pasta</h3>
      <p>Ruiz prefers to catch up on his carbs in the evening to top-up his energy levels after a hard day of training.</p>
      <p>Pasta is the perfect dish - but he has also taken a liking to Saudi Arabian food ahead of his 'Clash of the Dunes' fight, particularly their rice.</p>

      <h3>Ideal Meal - Steak</h3>
      <p>Given a choice, Ruiz reportedly goes for a steak whenever he gets the chance.</p>
      <p>It isn't quite as healthy as chicken and fish, which he eats more regularly, but he does regularly go for leaner cuts of steak when he can.</p>
      <h3>Snack - Wraps, Sandwiches, Fruit, Nuts.</h3>
      <p>Ruiz tends to have a snack or two in between meals, and these vary from wraps and sandwiches to fruits and nuts to top up his daily quota.</p>
      <p>If it is something he can travel with, then it can be a snack when Ruiz is out and about between meal times.</p>

      <h3>Cheat Meal - El Pastor con Queso Tacos</h3>
      <p>In a gruelling training camp, everyone is entitled to a cheat meal every once in a while.</p>
      <p>So what is Ruiz's choice? According to his nutritionist, it's tacos - with cheese inside and melted with marinated pork.</p>
      <p>The Destroyer is a big fan of the food from his Mexican roots as his choice of cheat meal shows.</p>
