      <h1>EastEnders SPOILER: Romance for Billy and Karen?</h1>
      <h2>He starts to see her in a new light</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:00:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Carena Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Billy Mitchell starts to see Karen Taylor in a new light in next week's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> - but could romance be on the cards?</p>
      <p>Neither of their love lives have been particularly bouyant of late.</p>
      <p>Karen's only real sniff of romance came earlier this year when she had a lesbian dalliance with someone she met at Pride.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Billy's spent the majority of the last year moping around over ex-wife Honey and trying to get her to see that her<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-spoilers-honey-difficult-choice-future-cheating-adam/"> new fella, Adam Bateman, is no good.Â </a></p>
      <p>It's fair to say Bill's mind hasn't been on romance with anyone else, but that all could be about to change as he employs Karen to work at the E20.</p>
      <p>Karen finds herself in a mess when Tubbs ignores Ben's orders to let her off another payment, and demands she pay up.</p>

      <p>Billy suggests Karen get a second job to raise the cash, but she takes that as an opportunity and railroads him into giving her a shot at the club.</p>
      <p>When she arrives for her trial shift, Karen's hard work impresses and Billy can't quite believe it.</p>
      <p>As he starts to see her in a new light, could something more be blooming?</p>

      <p>Although Billy looked a bit shocked as Karen planted a smacker on his lips, could his feelings have changed in a year?</p>
