      <p>PSG are facing an uphill battle to secure the future of star man Mbappe, who has been the subject of intense courtship by Los Blancos boss Zinedine Zidane in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman's advances, which included a suggestion that the 20-year-old "dreamed of playing for Real Madrid", drew the ire of PSG sporting director Leonardo, who publicly hit back at Los Blancos manager's uninvited comments.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, the reigning Ligue 1 champions are seemingly preparing for the eventuality that Mbappe might leave and have reportedly identified the France international's 2018 FIFA World Cup-winning teammate Antoine Griezmann as the ideal replacement.</p>
      <p>The reports originate from <i>FourFourTwo</i>, and it has been further claimed that PSG are undeterred by the fact that the 28-year-old only recently signed for the Blaugrana, and that he has been on the French club's radar for a long period of time.</p>
