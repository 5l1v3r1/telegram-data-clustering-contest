      <p>Two Plymouth Royal Marines are appealing for public support in their bid to represent Great Britain in the winter sport of bobsleigh.</p>
      <p>Colour Sergeant Ash Morris, 38, and Sergeant Adam Baird, 29, from 42 Commando, have been selected for British Bobsleigh’s two-man bobsleigh squad which is due to compete in the Europa Cup/European Championships this winter.</p>
      <p>UK Sport announced in April that it was withdrawing funding for British Bobsleigh, so team members are solely reliant on sponsorship and self-funding. CSgt Morris and Sgt Baird each need to raise £5,000 to secure their places on the team throughout the winter, which will fund travel expenses and race entry fees. They hope to raise the funds through sponsorship and have each launched crowdfunding websites.</p>
      <p>Securing coveted places on the British Bobsleigh Development Squad is a “dream come true” for both Commandos, and success this season could pave the way for a place on Team GB at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.</p>
      <p>“Bobsleigh is something I’ve always wanted to do since watching Cool Runnings as a kid! I love the sport,” he said. “It’s really difficult; you’re trying to control a wild sled on icy tracks with no brakes and the turns you make have to be so precisely timed. You can’t be even a blink of an eye out.</p>
      <p>“I love that it’s me against the track,” he continued. “Bobsleigh is as much mental as it is physical; it takes a lot of concentration and it also releases the mind and gives you clarity, because you’re so focussed. Imagine your mind like a deck of cards, it’s like shuffling them back into order. Bobsleigh keeps any mental stresses I might have off the track, at bay.”</p>
      <p>Due to there being no specific bobsleigh track in the UK, British Bobsleigh members train at a replica track at Bath University, and the gym. Both Marines are drivers, the only from the South West, in one of four, two-man teams and one female team.</p>
      <p>“Bobsleigh is a very aggressive sport yet I’m my calmest out there on the track,” he said. “This is a huge opportunity for us as it could potentially lead to us competing at the next Winter Olympics.</p>
      <p>“We are very grateful to all those who have donated and are helping us keep Britain’s representation in bobsleigh going.”</p>
      <p>The first event takes place in Winterberg, Germany, December 8 – 15, with the championships involving three to five races at locations across Europe from December to January.</p>
