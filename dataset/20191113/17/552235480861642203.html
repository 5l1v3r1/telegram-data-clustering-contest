      <h1>Pavements are Virgin on the ridiculous</h1>
      <h2>Paul Dewan said contractor the Keir Group moved into Drumsagard last month to dig up pavements to allow Virgin Media to install cabling, but left the pavement in a mess</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:10:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Edel Kenealy</a></address>
      <p>Fuming Cambuslang neighbours have slammed a telephone, TV and internet provider for leaving an “eyesore” of patched over, dug-up pavements outside their homes.</p>
      <p>Paul Dewan said contractor the Keir Group moved into Drumsagard last month to dig up pavements to allow Virgin Media to install cabling.</p>
      <p>Work began at the top of Acacia Way, where taxi driver Paul lives, and he claims workers are digging “trenches” to accommodate the cables.</p>
      <p>Although Paul says most householders have Sky and do not need the Virgin Media provision, he doesn’t object to the Virgin service being introduced.</p>
      <p>However, he says the condition in which the pavements are being left is “a disgrace.”</p>
      <p>“We’re very unhappy. It’s a mess,” complained dad Paul, 52, who says some residents are concerned that the state of the walkways may affect the value of their properties.</p>
      <p>“The pavements here are all nice. But by the time they have finished, they do not look like the rest of them.</p>
      <p>“When they are doing the work, they’re all fenced off, so I’m not saying they are dangerous, but they are being left in an unacceptable way.”</p>
      <p>Paul also claims he was told by a contractor it was too costly to return the pavements to their original condition and fumed: “We were not consulted or asked if we wanted this. We just got a letter telling us that is what we are getting, and that is it.”</p>
      <p>Also in receipt of the letter was Colin Hitchens, who is angry he wasn’t consulted.</p>
      <p>“It is a government initiative to get the fastest broadband for Scotland and I can see where they are coming from,” said Colin, 52.</p>
      <p>“I understand these things have to be done, but they did not consult the people about ripping our pavements up.</p>
      <p>“It is a mess. The workmen had to put down a ramp so I could get out. It doesn’t seem right Virgin come in and rip everybody’s pavements up.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy with my broadband and I haven’t heard anyone else complaining.”</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire’s head of roads and transportation, Gordon Mackay, said: “Virgin Media have statutory authority to install services in the public roads and footways.</p>
      <p>“The excavation and reinstatement of the footway is both satisfactory and fully compliant with the legislation and associated codes of practice.</p>
      <p>“In all cases, newly laid asphalt is naturally darker in colour than the existing surrounding footway which has discoloured due to ageing and weathering.</p>
      <p>“The nationally agreed specifications do not require Statutory Undertakers to resurface a footway over its full width, only the excavated trench.</p>
      <p>“The only exception to this is when the council have carried out footway resurfacing works within the last 12 months.”</p>
      <p>A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “Virgin Media is in the process of expanding its network in Glasgow which will bring ultrafast broadband speeds to local residents and businesses.</p>
      <p>“The black strip on the path is a result of narrow-trenching which allows us to complete our expansion works more efficiently and with minimal disruption to local communities.</p>
      <p>“As such, the condition of roads and pathways have been monitored throughout the build and we will work closely with the council to ensure that any corrective works are completed and meet the required standards.</p>
      <p>“We apologise for any inconvenience caused.”</p>
