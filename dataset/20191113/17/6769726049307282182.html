      <h1>Bach’s Christmas Oratorio to light up Perth Concert Hall</h1>

      <p>THE most magnificent, unmissable event this Christmas season is Bach’s Christmas Oratorio, coming to <a href="https://perthconcerthall.com.au/">Perth Concert Hall on Friday, December 13</a>.</p>
      <p>St George’s Concert Series (SGCS) is presenting Bach’s Christmas classic as an alternative to Handel’s ever-popular Messiah.</p>
      <p>“Albeit another extraordinary oratorio, Messiah was originally written to be performed in the lead-up to Easter in Dublin in 1742,” artistic director Dr Joseph Nolan said.</p>
      <p>“Messiah became a Christmas tradition much later, whereas JS Bach’s Christmas Oratorio was created to celebrate the Nativity, from the birth of Jesus to the journey of the Magi.</p>
      <p>“Bach’s oratorio is a wonderful, jubilant work utilising bright major keys and terrific storytelling through the colour of the music and instruments.</p>
      <p>“Bach is unbeatable and audiences can’t fail to be affected by his passion for the music.”</p>
      <p>The Christmas Oratorio is one of three massive concerts celebrating Bach during 2019 and 2020.</p>
      <p>St Matthew Passion earlier this year and Bach’s Easter Oratorio, a highlight planned for 2020, are both the result of a collaboration between St George’s Concert Series and the WA Symphony Orchestra.</p>

      <p>With St Matthew Passion a resounding success, the Christmas Oratorio is another wonderful chance to experience the transcendent sounds of Bach in a timely context.</p>
      <p>Dr Nolan said he wanted to include one of Bach’s most uplifting works for WA to enjoy this Christmas season.</p>
      <p>He will prepare and conduct the performance with his trademark passion and precision.</p>
      <p>The Christmas story will be told by top soloists soprano Sara Macliver, mezzo Fiona Campbell, tenor Paul McMahon and baritone Andrew Foote, all equally dedicated to an exquisite, heartfelt performance.</p>
      <p>They will be joined by the extraordinary singers of the St George’s Cathedral Consort and a carefully selected orchestra led by Paul Wright.</p>
      <p>Perth Concert Hall is an ideal venue for the performance, providing excellent acoustics, airconditioning, easy visibility and comfortable seating.</p>
      <p>This will be a Christmas event to relish and remember.</p>
      <p>Bach’s Christmas Oratorio is at 7.30pm, with tickets starting at $55 concession, $68 standard and a special price of only $30 for under 30s. Book through Perth Concert Hall, either online at <a href="https://perthconcerthall.com.au/">perthconcerthall.com.au</a> or on 9231 9999.</p>
