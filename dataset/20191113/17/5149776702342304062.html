      <h1>'Different class' - Nottingham Forest fans all in agreement on their player of the year</h1>
      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest news | The Reds are in fifth place in the Sky Bet Championship going into the November international break - and there are a number of contenders for the star player of the campaign so far</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>We have reached the final international break of the calendar year, and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> finds themselves in a healthy position in the Sky Bet Championship.</p>
      <p>The Reds are in fifth place in the league table following their win over arch rivals Derby County at the weekend, and are three points outside of the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfers-january-latest-3534689">automatic promotion places</a> with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi’s side will have confidence going into the remainder of the campaign that they can maintain their form and mount a serious promotion challenge with Premier League football is real possibility.</p>
      <p>Forest have played 18 matches so far this season – 15 in the league and three in the Carabao Cup – but which <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/sport-opinion/individual-quality-how-nottingham-forest-3533674">individual player has stood out</a> above the rest.</p>
      <p>We asked Reds fans who their player of the season so far would be, and the overwhelming majority went for the versatile Matty Cash.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been filling in at right-back for much of the campaign, with injuries to Tendayi Darikwa and Carl Jenkinson leaving Lamouchi short of options in that department.</p>
      <p>Here is what Reds fans had to say about Cash’s performances this season, when asked who their player of the season would be.</p>

      <p><b>Michael Guthrie:</b> “Matty Cash, change of position and quickly becoming the best right back in the Championship.”</p>
      <p><b>Joshua Booth:</b> “Cash all day long made some important tackles this season and shown much improvement one of the best right backs in the championship.”</p>
      <p><b>Mark Doughty:</b> “It’s great to have so many worthy winners for a change - Samba, Cash, Worrall, Watson. I’d go for Matty Cash but by a whisker!”</p>
      <p><b>Debra Smith:</b> “Soooo tough!!!! I think I might have to stick my neck out and say Cash. He’s been consistently great and it’s a new position for him which makes it even better. So many good ones though; Samba (both), Watson, Dawson before injury, Worrall, Grabban, Ribeiro.”</p>
      <p><b>Craig Leigh:</b> “Cash for me. All the others are playing their natural position and doing a cracking job. But Cash has been a different class in his new role.”</p>
      <p><b>Lee Tilston:</b> “Very tough. Could make a fair case for at least 5 but for me it has to be Matty Cash. Kind of forced by injury to play a position alien to him - a little bit ropey defensively first game...how far has he come in just 10-12 games!? Outstanding at both ends of the pitch, consistent and looks like the quintessential modern full back.”</p>
      <p><b>Andy Middleton:</b> “Between Cash and Samba for me. Cash definitely most improved playing in a new position but can’t wait for his energy to be used further up the pitch later in the season.”</p>
      <p><b>Eli Denton:</b> “Jayden Bogle for me, that assist for Grabban on Saturday was sublime. But in reality I’d go with Matty Cash, great transformation.”</p>
