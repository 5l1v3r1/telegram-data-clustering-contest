      <p>HONG KONG (Nov 13): Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group launched the share sale for its Hong Kong listing on Wednesday, braving unrest in the global financial hub to try to raise up to US$13.4 billion to fund its expansion plans.</p>
      <p>The stock is due to start trading on Nov 26 in Hong Kong, according to a term-sheet seen by Reuters.</p>
      <p>The books for institutional investors looking to buy the shares opened during the New York trading session on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A 661-page draft prospectus for what looks set to be the world's biggest cross-border secondary listing shows Alibaba plans to use the money to invest in online delivery and local services platform Ele.me, as well as online travel group Fliggy.</p>
      <p>It will also spend more on developing Youku, which Alibaba says is one of the leading online video platforms in China.</p>
      <p>The plans come against the backdrop of slowing e-commerce industry in China, with Alibaba's annual Singles' Day shopping blitz recording its weakest sales growth since its 2009 debut.</p>
      <p>The share sale, set to be Hong Kong's largest in more than nine years, is a boost for the city.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has sunk into its first recession in a decade as more than five months of street protests in which more than 2,300 people have been arrested as of last month, and worries about the US-China trade war took their toll.</p>
      <p>The progress of the protests is being monitored by Alibaba and its advisers, and is seen as a risk to the deal going ahead, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
      <p>The institutional book-building for the listing will run for a week and the stock is expected to be priced on or around Nov 20, two people with direct knowledge of the process said.</p>
      <p>A maximum price for the retail component of the deal will be announced next week, one said.</p>
      <p>The people could not be named because the information has not yet been made public.</p>
      <p>The company also intends to increase its investment in cloud computing and machine learning, the prospectus shows.</p>
      <p>The Hangzhou-based company said Alibaba Cloud was currently the world's third largest Infrastructure as a Service business, by US revenue in 2018, according to a study by Gartner.</p>
      <p>The prospectus shows Alibaba has 960 million 'digital economy users' in China, including customers of its Ant Financial partnership.</p>
      <p>The company said its revenue was 410.8 billion yuan (US$58.7 billion)for the year to June 30, 2019, and the total assets on its balance sheet were worth 1.01 trillion yuan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Discount</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alibaba had been planning to sell the shares earlier this year, but in August postponed the deal as the anti-government protests rocking Hong Kong since June became increasingly violent.</p>
      <p>However, a person familiar with the transaction said Alibaba was confident it could overcome the negative sentiment in Hong Kong financial markets caused by the demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Analyst James Cordwell from Atlantic Equities echoes the sentiment and said that an increasing likelihood of a deal in the US-China trade war in the next few weeks helped the company undertake the listing now.</p>
      <p>He said that while additional supply could weigh on the stock, over the longer run it could help the stock by broadening its investor base.</p>
      <p>The deal had been initially expected to raise up to US$15 billion, but 500 million primary shares will now be sold in the listing. Including a typical "greenshoe", or overallotment option, to sell some extra shares, the sale could raise up to US$13.4 billion.</p>
      <p>A sale of that size would dilute existing shareholders from the company's New York listing by 2.8%, and investors would be able trade shares between the two exchanges.</p>
      <p>Alibaba's US-listed shares were down 2.7% at US$181.94 in morning trade.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong shares are expected to be offered at a discount of up to 5% of the US equivalent.</p>
      <p>At US$13.4 billion, Alibaba’s share sale would rank as the world’s largest follow-on share sale targeting an entirely new stock exchange, according to data from Dealogic.</p>
      <p>Alibaba holds the world record for an initial public offering (IPO) with its US$25 billion New York flotation in 2014, but could shortly lose the crown to Saudi Arabia’s Aramco.</p>
      <p>The oil producer is expected to raise between US$20 billion and US$40 billion in an IPO expected to price in the coming weeks.</p>
