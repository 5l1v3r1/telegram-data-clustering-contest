      <h1>Lanzini, Noble, Wilshere - latest West Ham injury news and potential return dates</h1>
      <h2>West Ham news | When could some of the Hammers injured stars be looking at a return?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini's problems mounted prior to the international break as he lost two midfielders to injury during the 3-0 thumping at Burnley.</p>
      <p>Both Manuel Lanzini and Mark Noble left the field, the latter in the first half and the former in injury time, to reduce the manager's options in midfield for the foreseeable future in the case of Lanzini.</p>
      <p>The Argentine number ten has undergone surgery on a fractured collarbone on Monday and is expected to be out for around six to eight weeks which would rule him out for the rest of 2019.</p>
      <p>Noble had an MRI scan on an ankle sprain earlier this week and it is hoped he will be fit for the visit of Spurs in ten days time though it might only be enough for the bench.</p>
      <p>Jack Wilshere missed the Burnley defeat as well, his third game in a row he's been absent for, after picking up his injury prior to the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio is expected to be fit for the Spurs game as he is due to return to training over the international break having been out since August after hamstring surgery.</p>
      <p>Winston Reid meanwhile made his comeback for the Hammers U23s last midweek.</p>
