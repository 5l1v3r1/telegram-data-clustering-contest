      <h1>Currys and Carphone Warehouse Also Have Black Friday Sales That Kicked Off Today</h1>

      <p>You're not imagining it, Black Friday really does get earlier every single year. To the point where we're still over two weeks out from the big day, and the retailers have already started pushing official Black Friday deals. None of this pre-Black Friday nonsense, or trying to hide stuff under a different name like 'Hidden Gems'. Now both Currys and the Carphone Warehouse are up to that trick with the "Why Wait" sale.</p>
      <p>It's not surprising to hear that both retailers are launching those deals at the same time. They are, after all, owned by the same company. But hey money off is money off, right? Especially if you really want one of the few things that's already had a discount.</p>
