      <p>The 24-year-old has been equally impressive when he does manage a starting berth, particularly when he recently netted an impressive brace against Chippa United.</p>
      <p>Off the field, the soft-spoken star has a penchant for the Sergeant Pepper Clothing Co brand and can often be found rocking their ensembles.</p>
      <p>Zuma manages to pull off laid-back casual looks with relative ease and hardly puts a foot wrong when it comes to his fashion game.</p>
