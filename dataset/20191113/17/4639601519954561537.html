      <p>The judiciary has sent to Parliament the testimony of former caretaker PM and current Vice Premier Panagiotis Pikrammenos – who previously served as president of the Council of State – in which states his belief that former alternate justice minister Dimitris Papaggelopoulos was the person who implicated him in the Novartis scandal.</p>
      <p>Pikrammenos opined that it was Papaggelopoulos who was pulling the strings in planning the prosecution of ten prominent politicians, including former PM Antonis Samaras (New Democracy).</p>

      <p>Pikrammenos reportedly maintained that the manner in which the Corruption Prosecutor handled the case “creates the sense that there was central planning” that was intended to target him.</p>
      <p>The cases of nine of the ten politicians have been closed, but Movement for Change MP Andreas Loverdos, a former health minister, will be charged with repeated bribe-taking.</p>
