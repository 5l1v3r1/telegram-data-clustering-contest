      <h1>Driver speaks about lucky escape after his lorry overturned</h1>
      <h2>He was following a diversion route</h2>

      <p>A truck driver has told of the moment his articulated lorry overturned, leaving him dangling from his seatbelt. It all happened within two seconds.</p>
      <p>Darran Wheatley escaped almost unscathed from the accident on Saturday morning, November 9, but a police officer who rushed to the scene told him he was lucky to be alive.</p>
      <p>Father-of-four Mr Wheatley, 54, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ilkeston">Ilkeston</a> , was returning to the Nottingham depot of Reynolds Logistics when the 55ft-long vehicle, loaded with bags of plaster and nearing its maximum weight of 44 tonnes, tipped on its side in Nottingham Road, Loughborough.</p>
      <p>Although a B-road, it was signposted as a diversion and 7.5-tonne weight restriction signs had been greyed out, he said.</p>
      <p>“There are no kerb edgings, it’s just tarmac and then fields,” Mr Wheatley said.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got oncoming traffic and because it’s so narrow, you have to hold your line and that puts you right on the edge of the road. But it appears that the tarmac had fallen away.</p>
      <p>“My back wheels dropped into the soil and pulled me down, straight off the road and through the hedgerows and dropped me on my side.</p>
      <p>“I was then hanging sideways by my seatbelt. I grabbed my handrail near the driver’s door and undid my seatbelt but couldn’t hold my body weight with one hand, so I just dropped down eight foot on to the passenger side.</p>
      <p>“It was all over in two seconds. I didn’t have time to think of anything.</p>
      <p>“By the time I had dropped down, some guys who had been driving behind me kicked the windscreen in and I climbed out through that.”</p>
      <p>Police and paramedics were quickly on the scene and he was checked over in an ambulance before being taken home by his employer with nothing more serious than a sprained calf.</p>
      <p>Luckily, the vehicle had tipped on to the passenger side – or the outcome might have been very different.</p>
      <p>“The copper said I was lucky because he had been to one earlier where it had fallen on the other side and killed the driver.”</p>
      <p>Wife Tanya was waiting at home for his return when he phoned with the news.</p>
      <p>“It frightened me because I couldn’t see for myself that he was all right,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Wheatley, a trucker for 20 years, said the firm was able to track its vehicles’ movements and told him that he was doing 32mph on the 50mph stretch, then 16mph a second later, and then on his side one second after that.</p>
      <p>He was spending a few days at home to recuperate this week but planned to be back behind the wheel soon.</p>
      <p>“I do know drivers who have rolled trucks and never driven again,” he said. “It’s not put me off but I won’t know until I get back in the cab.”</p>
      <p>Rod Harris, co-owner of Reynolds Logistics, of Coventry Lane, said: “Darran has done nothing wrong – it’s just one of those freak occurrences and I’m grateful that no-one was hurt. He has our full support.”</p>
