      <p>After months of rumors, the revamped 16-inch MacBook Pro is official. Here is everything you need to know about the new machine.</p>

      <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/13/apples-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-is-built-to-blaze-through-pro-workflows">This redesign</a> follows a minor spec bump in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/07/09/apple-updates-macbook-pro-adding-touch-bar-to-entire-range">mid-2019</a> and the large redesign <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/10/27/apple-announces-thinner-macbook-pro-with-touch-bar-touch-id">that happened in late 2016</a>. While the external appearance is about the same, it is a bit larger in every dimension, in part to pack in a larger display.<br/><br/>In addition to the slightly larger size, Apple has reduced the bezels on all sides to provide more usable screen real estate for pro users.</p>

      <p>In regards to that size increase, it is so subtle that it likely won't be noticeable unless side-by-side. The new MacBook Pro also weighs a bit more, mostly due to the new battery that is absolutely the largest that the TSA allows, that can provide an additional hour of use.</p>
      <h3>Improved keyboard</h3>
      <p>Also new on the updated <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/macbook_pro">MacBook Pro</a> is an improved keyboard. The new <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/magic_keyboard">Magic Keyboard</a>-derived design also returns the inverted "T" arrow keys and dissociates the escape key from the Touch Bar.</p>

      <p>Apple's Phil Schiller <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/13/apples-phil-schiller-discusses-16-inch-macbook-pro-keyboard-design-versus-butterfly">talked at length</a> about designing the new machine and how much effort went into making it comfortable and stable to type on, while still being reliable. With the redesign, we are excited to try out the 1mm of key travel, and see how it differs from the 2019 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <h3>More power GPU and better cooling</h3>
      <p>Thanks to the new GPUs, it can support up to two displays with 6016by3384 resolution at 60Hz or up to four displays with 4096by2304 resolution at 60Hz. That includes two Apple Pro Display XDRs when they launch this December.<br/><br/>Other improvements include better cooling for longer sustained maximum performance, and a faster 96W USB-C charger.</p>
      <h3>Improved speakers</h3>
      <p>After much-improved audio came to its recent products such as the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/06/review-apples-beats-solo-pro-are-the-best-beats-yet">Beats Solo Pro</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/07/airpods-pro-review-you-dont-need-to-be-an-airpods-power-user-to-appreciate-them">AirPods Pro</a>, and even the iPhone 11 Pro, the MacBook Pro also has better audio reproduction from the six on-board speakers.</p>
