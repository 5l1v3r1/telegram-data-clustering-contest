      <h1>Government to focus more of fixing roads</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:42:50+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Hafsa Obeng, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA – Mr Ken Ofori Atta, Minister of Finance has said that government would focus more on fixing the roads across the country in 2020 and beyond.</p>
      <p>He said government had identified critical roads across each of the 16 regions and construction would begin on all these critical roads soon, saying to get the road sector moving and contractors back to work, government will pay 80 per cent of all contractors.</p>
      <p>Delivering the 2020 budget on Wednesday in Parliament, Mr Ofori Atta said “with this large number of roads to be constructed, the year 2020 can aptly be described as “The Year of Roads” along with a focus on all our flagship programmes.”</p>
      <p>He said COCOBOD also secured funds to continue with on-going and new cocoa roads and work on them would also commence soon.</p>
      <p>“As part of our new initiative to complement the traditional execution of road projects, we have launched the Accelerated Community Road Improvement Initiative. Just this month, the Ministry of Finance released funds to the 48 Engineers Regiment of the Ghana Armed Forces, who are busy working on some roads in communities in Greater Accra.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori Atta noted that the first phase of the Sinohydro arrangement, was finally taking off, and government was able to mobilise the financing for over 150 roads nation-wide.</p>
      <p>“Ghanaians want action on our roads, not words or plans or Green Book claims about what has been done. We intend to swing into action and let our work do the talking for us.</p>
      <p>On governance, he said government would deepen and decentralize governance and enhance peace, and therefore created six new regions, proceeding with a referendum to elect MMDCEs, settled the long running chieftaincy dispute in Dagbon, appointed a Special Prosecutor for corruption and passed into law, the Right to Information (RTI) Bill, which was on the radar for the last 20 years.</p>
      <p>He mentioned that government had worked hard over the last three years to deliver a substantial number of remarkable achievements, which they would consolidate going forward.</p>
      <p>“As we can all testify, the last three years were remarkable and we are grateful to God and the good citizens of Ghana for what we have achieved. Going forward, we will consolidate the gains made and pursue our transformation agenda, so help us God.”</p>
      <p>He said the way forward required bold and courageous leadership and this Government has exhibited such mettle: The free SHS programme, the banking reform, the renegotiation of the energy sector, the new Ghana-Ivory Coast declared floor price and living income differential of $400 per tonne, the termination of the PDS contract and the Financial Responsibility Act.</p>
      <p>“Fellow Ghanaians, we must go forward together. Let us break disunity and poverty with a rod of iron. Let us go forth with a Spirit of power, love and self-discipline. This 2020 budget assures us of a stable and peaceful year in which there are no new taxes, our roads will be built, we shall strengthen partnerships with Labour, Employers and Faith-Based Organisations, lending rates will come down, the National Development Bank and the Enterprise Credit Scheme will finance industry, businesses, mortgages and entrepreneurs. We shall indeed consolidate the Gains for Growth, Jobs and Prosperity for all our people. Let us rise and build together.”</p>
