      <h1>Fitbit OS 4.1 brings smart wake to older smartwatches, better heart-rate measuring for Versa 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:24:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/jules-wang/" target="_blank">Jules Wang</a></address>
      <p>In time for the holiday season, Fitbit is updating a whole bunch of software and services in the hopes of getting everyone excited and resolved for a healthier 2020 — just as it hopes <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/01/google-confirms-fitbit-acquisition-and-hints-at-future-own-brand-wearable/">Google ownership</a> will improve its stance in the fitness tech marketplace. Fitbit OS 4.1 will be rolling out some features originally exclusive to the Versa 2 to other smartwatches while Fitbit Premium will be adopting more special routines to inspire some better habits.</p>
      <p>For the Fitbit <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/04/04/fitbit-ionic-long-term-review-fitbit-may-track-wearable-win/">Ionic</a> and the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/27/fitbit-versa-review-fitbits-cheaper-smartwatch-also-better-smartwatch/">original Versa</a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/03/06/fitbit-introduces-new-inspire-70-and-inspire-hr-100-versa-lite-160-and-ace-2-for-kids-70/">Versa Lite</a> models, OS 4.1 will bring the Versa 2's sleep cycle-optimized haptic alarm setting, known as smart wake, and on-device Sleep Score viewing for users to check as soon as they get out of bed.</p>
      <p>Amazon Alexa support remains exclusive to the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/28/fitbit-versa-2-premium-subscription-aria-air/">Versa 2</a>, but this update will allow users to command the watch to start any of the 20 exercise modes in the Exercise app. The watch's heart rate monitor is also gaining a PurePulse algorithm that is expected to latch onto wearers' beat signature and produce more accurate readings. And to top it off, the always-on AMOLED display is now available in color for peekable data.</p>
      <p>For all smartwatches, there's also a new clock face switcher which lets users swap between five of their designs — the Versa 2 also gets a similar always-on display face switcher — a new power-saving mode which shuts off certain equipment when the battery level hits a low threshold, an agenda app for tracking their schedules, and a new five-star rating system for everything in the Fitbit App Gallery.</p>
      <p>And as for the Fitbit Premium service, subscribers will soon get a long-term wellness report that tracks weight, activity, heart rate, and sleep data over long periods of time — from a month up to a year. Details on what that will look like have yet to be released (<a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/wellness-report">a linked blog post</a> shows up as a 404). This and many more routines and games from partners such as POPSUGAR will be coming over the next few months.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Fitbit OS 4.1 will roll out from December 3.</p>
