      <p><b>Original Article (Thu 7th Nov, 2019 11:00 GMT):</b> Despite the Nintendo Switch indie scene being more than covered by the numerous physical, limited run websites that have popped up in recent times, we have yet another one to keep an eye on. Introducing Gamefairy.</p>
      <p>Joining the likes of Limited Run Games, Strictly Limited Games, Signature Edition Games, and Super Rare Games (phew!), Gamefairy "strives to bring outstanding games by independent teams to a physical existence as high quality limited editions, going an extra mile to differentiate the boxed editions from their pure digital form". At first, these websites were a dream come true for collectors, but we can't imagine what it's like for the poor souls who were intending to secure a full set of Switch releases.</p>
      <p>Gamefairy will be kicking things off with a Collector's Edition of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bridge_constructor_portal"><b>Bridge Constructor Portal</b></a>, exclusively for Nintendo Switch. It'll be limited to just 3,000 copies and will include the following:</p>
      <blockquote>- A physical copy of Bridge Constructor Portal for Nintendo Switch<br/>- The Nintendo Switch orginal game case with reversible cover art Inlay<br/>- A high quality Collector's Box<br/>- Three gorgeous Bridge Constructor Portal fridge magnets<br/>- Two beautiful printed art cards<br/>- An individually numbered Buyer's Certificate<br/>- Gamefairy Collector's Stamp #001</blockquote>
