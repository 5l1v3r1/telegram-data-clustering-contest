      <p>Patrick Kluivert spoke about Ansu Fari to the club magazine.</p>
      <p>"I chose to come to Barca because I know the club, after being here six years as a player and I have a good feeling with the club and the fans," Kluivert said of his own return to take charge of the youth academy.</p>
      <p>"I have the feeling that I can bring a lot to La Masia and I didn't have to think much about taking the offer.</p>
      <p>"It's important that the players feel at home and can perform to the max, as well as taking care of their health and the communication between the teams."</p>
      <p>The idea is that players jump up to the first team eventually, like Carles Perez and Ansu Fati this season.</p>
      <p>"It's good they're getting first team minutes and can show their worth. Ansu has his head straight and his feet on the ground. I've spoken a lot to him and he's very conscious of his situation.</p>
      <p>"We have to respect the Cruyff philosophy, the club values and we are here to protect them, so it's essential to nourish the first team with youth players from the club."</p>
