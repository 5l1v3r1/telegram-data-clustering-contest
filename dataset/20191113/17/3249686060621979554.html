      <p><b>Horan</b> appeared on <b>MBN</b>'s<b> 'We Can Love Again' </b>where she spoke openly about her divorce.</p>
      <p>She appeared on the November 13 broadcast of the show where she explained, "<i>Before I got married, I made it clear that I have no plans to have children. We both agreed and I married my ex-husband."</i></p>
      <p>It appears that this issue later became an issue of contention between the two, which eventually led to their divorce.</p>
      <p>We hope Horan finds love again one day!</p>
