      <h1>Tesla will build new 'Gigafactory' in Germany, CEO Musk says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:55:52+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author">Ed Adamczyk</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Tesla Motors will build a new battery factory in Germany, CEO <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Elon_Musk/?tps=1">Elon Musk</a> said.</p>
      <p>Musk <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-announces-gigafactory-design-center-near-berlin.html">said the "Gigafactory"</a> will be located in Brandenburg state, which surrounds Berlin, and "near the new airport." He also announced plans to build a design and engineering center in Berlin.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/brandenburg-in-eastern-germany-happy-to-get-a-tesla-gigafactory/a-51222973">new factory</a> -- where production of batteries, powertrains and cars could start by 2021 -- will be Tesla's fourth, after a battery plant near Reno, Nev., an electronics and solar battery plant in Buffalo, N.Y., and a manufacturing facility in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>Since 2016, Musk has indicated he wants a European plant. Tesla acquired German auto design firm Grohmann Engineering in 2017, and sales of Tesla cars have been stronger in Europe than the United States. Some experts feel a factory in a European Union nation could help Tesla avoid import complexities and uncertainties involving potential tariffs. The Brandenburg region is not a traditional German location for auto making operations.</p>
      <p>"It's magnificent, it's like Christmas coming early for our region," said Carsten Bronstrup of UVB, a Brandenburg business association.. "The region is not particularly known for its strong industry, so getting a Gigafactory will push future-oriented technologies such as battery production and autonomous driving."</p>
      <p>Tesla has previously said it will assemble its Model 3 and forthcoming Model Y sport-utility vehicle in Europe.</p>
