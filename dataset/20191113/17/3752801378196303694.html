      <h1>WATCH: City of Tshwane workers block streets, dump rubbish before wage deal is struck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:42:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>The City of Tshwane has confirmed it has reached an agreement with workers over the benchmarking of wages.</p>
      <p>The confirmation comes after municipal workers took to the streets, blocking and barricading them with municipal vehicles and rubbish from bins on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>They were awaiting the outcomes of negotiations between the City and labour unions.</p>
      <p>Commuters had to change their routes around the capital city as workers gathered outside Tshwane House. Madiba, Van der Walt and Thabo Sehume streets were gridlocked.</p>
      <p>The City suspended the Tshwane Bus Services (TBS) on Monday, as workers were reportedly unhappy with the pace at which the process of benchmarking salaries was taking place.</p>
      <p>The process was announced in July, following a week of demonstrations and interruption to service delivery in the capital.</p>
      <p>In a statement released after 13:00 on Wednesday, the City said a Labour Law Forum (LLF) sub-committee - made up of representatives of the City and unions - was working to finalise the specific levels and the implementation dates of the benchmarking, as per the resolution of council.</p>
      <p>Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa's spokesperson Omogolo Taunyane said, at the back of the benchmarking process, was a long-delayed process of rationalising the remuneration regime of the City since the municipalities merged from 2011.</p>
      <p>The municipality said city services should be fully operational before the end of the week, with workers returning to their posts on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The City said it would release a statement later, setting out more details of the plan.</p>
      <p>It has apologised to residents for the disruptions and asked that they be patient as it tries to resolve the impasse.</p>
