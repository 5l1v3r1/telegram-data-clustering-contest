      <p>Saudi authorities distanced themselves from an official video that sparked controversy after it branded feminism, homosexuality, and atheism as "extremist" ideas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a>'s state security agency posted the animated video on Twitter last weekend at a time when de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanÂ (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/mohammed-bin-salman.html">MBS</a>) is seeking to open up the austere kingdom to foreign tourists and overhaul its ultra-conservative image.</p>
      <p>The tweet has since been taken down.</p>
      <p>The security agency said the video contained "many mistakes" and suggested that those behind it would face a formal investigation, according to a statement posted late on Tuesday by the official Saudi Press Agency.</p>
      <p>It also rejected a report in Al-Watan, a local daily, that said feminists will be jailed and subject to flogging.</p>
      <p>In a separate statement, the kingdom's human rights commission stressed "feminism is not criminalised" and it accords "the utmost importance to women's rights".</p>
      <p>The two statements made no mention of homosexuality or atheism, which are both illegal and punishable by death in the kingdom.</p>
      <h3>'Extremely dangerous'</h3>
      <p>The video sparked criticism from rights campaigners with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/amnesty-international.html">Amnesty International</a> saying it was "extremely dangerous" and had "serious implications for the rights to freedom of expression and life, liberty and security in the country".</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has long faced international criticism over its treatment of women.</p>
      <p>MBS has sought to ease restrictions on women with multiple reforms, including a historic decree that ended a decades-old ban on female motorists.</p>
      <p>In August, Saudi Arabia also allowed women to obtain passports without seeking the approval of their "guardians" - fathers, husbands, or other male relatives.</p>
      <p>The move - part of MBS' plan to revamp the national image - ended a long-standing rule that prompted attempts by women to flee the kingdom.</p>
      <p>But observers say loopholes still allow male relatives to curtail their movements and, in the worst cases, leave them marooned in prison-like shelters.</p>
      <p>Alongside a string of pro-women reforms, Saudi authorities have also cracked down on female activists.</p>
      <p>Nearly a dozen women campaigners, arrested just before the ban on women driving ended last year, are currently facing trials that have drawn criticism from Western governments.</p>
