      <p>Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Firefighters in Australia have gained attention for leaving a note apologizing for drinking a man's milk after they saved his house from a wildfire.</p>
      <p>Paul Sekfy of New South Wales posted the handwritten note <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214955910993479&amp;set=a.2268061983256&amp;type=3&amp;theater">on Facebook</a> which was signed by the Urunga Rural Fire Service.</p>
      <p>"It was our pleasure to save your house. Sorry that we could not save your sheds," the note said. "P.S. - we owe you some milk."</p>
      <p>Firefighter Hardie-Porter was a part of the team sent to the house and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/australia/australia-firefighter-milk-scli-intl/index.html">told CNN</a> that he and the other firefighters took some milk due to not having eaten anything for hours.</p>
      <p>Sekfy noted that the firefighters also had cheese and peanut butter, which he is okay with.</p>
      <p>"They don't have to pay back the milk, I'll just sort them a couple of cases of beer," he said.</p>
