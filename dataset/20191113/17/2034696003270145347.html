        <b>And the mystery just keeps on going...</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="http://nme.com/tag/game-of-thrones"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a> coffee cup mystery continues, following a denial by the supposed culprit that it was indeed his mistake.</p>
      <p>Conleth Hill, who played Lord Varys in the hit HBO show, was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/emilia-clarke-reveals-which-game-of-thrones-star-is-behind-coffee-cup-blunder-2562985">recently called out as the cast member who made the famous blunder by Emilia Clarke</a> (Daenerys Targaryen).</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The ongoing saga began when, during episode 4 of season 8 of the show, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-creators-address-season-eight-coffee-cup-gaffe-2543952">fans spotted a disposable coffee cup among jugs of alcohol in a celebratory drinking scene</a>.</p>
      <p>Many rumours have gone around as to who was responsible for the gaffe. Back in June, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/sophie-turner-says-lazy-kit-harington-blame-game-thrones-coffee-cup-gaffe-2505514">Sophie Turner blamed the “lazy” Kit Harington</a>, having <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-star-sophie-turner-on-who-is-to-blame-for-coffee-cup-gaffe2487028-2487028">previously pointed the finger at Clarke</a>.</p>

      <p>Emilia Clarke had pointed the finger at Conleth Hill in the ongoing <i>Game of Thrones</i> coffee cup saga.</p>
      <p>Last month, speaking on <i>The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,</i>,<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/emilia-clarke-reveals-which-game-of-thrones-star-is-behind-coffee-cup-blunder-2562985"> Clarke, who played Daenerys Targaryen, revealed that Hill was behind the blunder</a>, seemingly putting the matter to bed.</p>
      <p>Now, speaking to Channel 4 on <i>Sunday Brunch</i>, Hill refused to admit to the gaffe.</p>
      <p>“You know, there’s no proof that I did it. So accuse away,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I would need to have had Mr. Man arms to leave a coffee cup there. I took a bullet for Emilia Clarke and she touted on me.”</p>
      <p>He jokingly added: “I’m just not making any comments until I have a lawyer!”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/emilia-clarke-calls-game-of-thrones-backlash-flattering-as-she-responds-to-remake-petition-2567004">Clarke recently called the backlash to the <i>Game of Thrones</i> finale “flattering”</a> while she responded to a fan petition to remake season 8 of the show, which is approaching the two million mark.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-sequel-starring-naomi-watts-has-been-cancelled-by-hbo-2562428">HBO scrapped an upcoming <i>Game Of Thrones</i> prequel, set to star Naomi Watts, even though a pilot episode had already been filmed</a>.</p>
      <p>In its place, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/house-dragon-hbo-confirms-new-game-thrones-prequel-2562527">a full series for a separate <i>Game Of Thrones</i> spin-off titled <i>House Of The Dragon</i></a> is instead set to begin production with HBO.</p>
