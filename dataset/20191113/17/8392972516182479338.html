      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.new-magazine.co.uk/">New!</a> magazine, a source revealed that she is "petrified" that once her divorce from the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/britains-got-talent/">Britain's Got Talent</a> host is finalised, he will propose to Anne-Marie.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, it's claimed they broke down because Lisa can't "bear the thought" of Ant asking Anne-Marie to marry him while they're out in Oz.</p>
      <p>The source added the thought of an Aussie engagement makes Lisa "feel sick".</p>

      <p>"So while she's desperate to move on and put this all behind her, there's also part of her that's petrified of letting go and facing the reality of the man she thought she'd spend forever with vowing to spend his future with someone else."</p>
      <p>Ant, meanwhile, makes his return to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-full-line-up-revealed-as-stars-pose-for-first-official-photos/">I'm A Celebrity alongside partner Declan Donnelly</a> after taking time off from hosting the show last year.</p>
