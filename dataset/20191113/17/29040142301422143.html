      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Disney+ officially launched on November 12, 2019.</li>
        <li>It's now being reported that the service already has over 10 million subscribers.</li>
        <li>The app has been downloaded 3.2 million times.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether you're a Marvel fanatic, Star Wars superfan, or crazy about all things Disney princesses, yesterday was an exciting day. On November 12, 2019, Disney+ officially launched and opened the floodgates for endless streaming of your favorite shows and movies. Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963172/disney-plus-subscribers-10-million-star-wars-marvel-pixar-launch">it's being reported</a> that Disney+'s initial launch was wildly successful.</p>
      <p>Despite just launching one day ago, Disney+ has already acquired over 10 million subscribers. For some context, Netflix revealed that <a href="https://www.cordcutters.com/netflix-subscribers-and-earnings">it has over 158 million subscribers</a> worldwide during its latest Q3 earnings call.</p>
      <p>What makes Disney+'s 10 million number even more impressive is the fact that it's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus-available-countries">only available in three countries</a> â€” including the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands. Compared to the over 190 countries that you can get Netflix in, the potential for Disney+'s growth is massive.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will expand to Australia and New Zealand come November 19, and as the service starts to enter more and more markets, there's no telling how big it could get.</p>
      <p>With that said, it's worth keeping in mind that a lot of people who signed up yesterday likely did with a free trial. Disney+'s free trial is good for seven days, and after that, you need to start paying the $7/month or $70/year asking price. Some people just testing the waters are bound to jump ship, but even so, this is an awfully encouraging data point for the new streaming giant.</p>
