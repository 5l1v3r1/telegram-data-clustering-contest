      </p>
      <p>Jake, who won last year's series of the skating show, wrote on Instagram: "Absolutely devastated that I have had to pull out of @dancingonice Christmas launch show.</p>
      <p>"I have broken a bone in my neck and I lost feeling in my right arm and hand for a few days after the injury, luckily this is improving but I don’t have enough time to heal unfortunately.</p>
      <aside>Really gutted but I will support all the amazing people taking part!</aside>
      <p>"I have to put into perspective that I can’t risk falling and damaging my neck even more, I obviously was so looking forward to dancing again with @vanessabauer_skates and I wanted to take part but the amazing medical team think it’s a risk.</p>
      <p>"I know what I’m like and I put 100% into everything and with ice skating this means I fall a lot and one bad fall could be really really bad!!"</p>
