      <h1>The best movies on Disney Plus in November 2019</h1>
      <h2>Wondering what films to watch on Disney Plus? Take a look at our top picks to help you decide - whatever mood you're in</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:05:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Cowton</a></address>
      <p>Crack out your Mickey Mouse ears, because Disney Plus has finally launched. Though many will be flocking straight to The Mandalorian, there’s also a towering library of hundreds of movies to watch on a rainy day (or any day, we're not judging). Of course, with this much content to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, we here at Tech Advisor have perused through the library - learning in the process that we’re apparently big suckers for Disney films - and cherry picked a list of some of our favourites. From superhero blockbusters to cheesy musicals, there’s something here to suit everyone.</p>
      <p>Based in the UK but still want to watch these films?

        <h3>Lion King</h3>

        </ul>
        <p>This is Disney at its best. Iconic songs, beautiful 2D animation and a story that will literally leave you sobbing every single time you watch it (no, just us?), as you follow the heir to the kingdom, Simba. The 2019 remake isn’t on the service just yet, but the original blows it out the water anyway. </p>
        <anchor name="toc-3777777-2">
          <h3>Saving Mr Banks</h3>
          <figure>

              <b>RRP:</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson shine in this dramatic adaptation of the creation of Mary Poppins. The film follows writer Pamela Travers as she works with Walt Disney to develop her musical for the silver screen, but the two disagree vastly on some of the elements.</p>
          <anchor name="toc-3777777-3">
            <h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777777/avengers_endgame_thumb800.jpg"/>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We couldn’t write this list and not include the new best-selling movie of all time. What makes Endgame is so special is that it’s the culmination of over ten years worth of Marvel movies, and is a true spectacle to behold. Of course - you’ll need to have watched at least some of the MCU films to know what’s going on.</p>
            <anchor name="toc-3777777-4">
              <h3>Big Hero 6</h3>
              <figure>
                <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777777/big_hero_6_copy_thumb800.png"/>

                  <b>RRP:</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>This collaboration between Disney animation and Marvel results in a geek’s dream. Big Hero 6 features six (go figure) slap-hazard supes, including the big, lovable, inflatable robot, Baymax. We dare you to watch and not cry. WE DARE YOU.</p>
              <anchor name="toc-3777777-5">
                <h3>Mary Poppins</h3>
                <figure>
                  <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777777/mary_poppins_thumb800.jpg"/>

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some of the most iconic musical numbers stem from Mary Poppins - so it's easy to see why this film is treasured so dearly. Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are the perfect leading pair, with dance numbers that’ll make you tired just watching them. Plus it’s hilarious watching the old special effects (they were good for the time). </p>

                  <h3>Zootopia</h3>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777777/zootopia_thumb800.jpg"/>

                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Listen - don’t discount this film because its characters are a talking bunny and fox. This heartfelt tale actually has a lot of underlying social and political messages. We were pleasantly surprised and would put this one up with the likes of Inside Out.</p>

                    <h3>The Muppets Christmas Carol</h3>
                    <figure>
                      <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777777/muppets_christmas_carol_thumb800.jpg"/>

                        <b>RRP:</b>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If it’s Christmas, then this is perfect. If it’s not, then this’ll make you feel like it’s Christmas. This retelling of the Dickens classic is so iconic that you’ll find the original a bit of a drag after watching this. And if The Muppets weren't enough for you, this film has Michael Caine has Ebenezer Scrooge. Genius. </p>
                    <anchor name="toc-3777777-8">
                      <h3>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h3>
                      <figure>
                        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777777/captain_america_the_winter_soldier_thumb800.jpg"/>

                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Of all the MCU films, this is arguably the one with the best action sequences, with some serious hand-to-hand combat that will make your jaw drop. The sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, we see Steve Rogers dealing with 21st century life, as well as the emergence of the modern day Hydra.</p>

                        <h3>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</h3>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The first Star Wars in the new saga, this JJ Abrams classic kicks off the last third of the Skywalker saga in style. With faces old and new, any sci-fi fan is guaranteed to love this. And BB-8 is pretty much the most adorable droid to ever exist.</p>

                          <h3>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</h3>
                          <figure>

                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Roger Rabbit was a first of its kind: bringing together real actors with some of the most iconic cartoons, including Jessica Rabbit and Bugs Bunny. It also features Christopher Lloyd as the villain of the film, Judge Doom. As a warning, you’ll never see him just as Doc from Back to the Future after this. He's terrifying. </p>

                            <h3>101 Dalmatians</h3>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The original cartoon is pretty good, but the live-action remake is just a scream - especially because it features Glenn Close as the evil fashionista, Cruella De Ville. Plus, you get ALL the adorable Dalmatian puppies, which alone should be enough to sell this one.</p>

                              <h3>Flubber</h3>

                              <p>Any Robin Williams film is a joy, and Flubber is no exception. Professor Philip Brainard discovers a new rubber-like substance that has a chaotic energy of its own, and ends up taking the scientist on a mad series of events, causing him to miss his own wedding.</p>

                                <p>Looking for a change of pace from Iron Man and Thor? Guardians of the Galaxy really pioneered the MCU into letting loose and having fun with their stories. This space flick is hilarious, action-packed and emotional all in one. Plus, you'll fall in love with Groot. </p>

                                  <p>Alright, POTC is a series that may have gone a little too long, and has now fallen victim to becoming yet another reboot. However, this noughties classic is the pinnacle of pirate films, with the most nautical theme from Hans Zimmer, and just the right amount of ridiculousness.</p>

                                        <p>Keeping up with all the Star Wars films can be quite a chore, which is why Rogue One is a nice change of pace as it could arguably be a standalone film and a prequel to A New Hope at the same time. Despite having almost an entirely new cast, there are a few familiar faces that will get you excited. </p>

                                          <p>You may be wondering why this is in here, and honestly, so are we. But as cheesy comedies go, this is one not to be missed. Especially when you get terrible Italian accents and the iconic collaboration with Hilary Duff singing with… Hilary Duff. Yeah, that happened.</p>

Follow monsters Mike and Sully as they accidentally become in charge of the adorable (but terrifying to them) toddler, Boo. </p>

The rebellion struggle to hold their ground against the might of the Empire, whilst Luke Skywalker continues his Jedi training with Master Yoda.
