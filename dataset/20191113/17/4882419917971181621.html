      <p>Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu spoke in Cartagena, where Barcelona are playing a benefit match on Wednesday. Asked about the team potentially being whistled because of the Catalan issue, he says he is "expecting a sporting and charitable atmosphere" for the game, remembering that Barca are here "to help and tell those hurt by the damage in September that we are with them."</p>
      <p>Barca face Cartagena at 7pm in a match organised to raise funds for those affected by the torrential rain and floods that happened earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Bartomeu added: "We're looking forward to collaborating and helping with a good game and offering a good spectacle that helps the people of Murcia."</p>
      <p>Six first team footballers are in Barca's squad - Neto, Pique, Sergi Roberto, Junior Firpo, Carles Alena and Ousmane Dembele.</p>
