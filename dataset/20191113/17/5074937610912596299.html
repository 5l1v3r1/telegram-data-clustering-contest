      <p>He said on November 11, this year, the deceased, Agnes Maku Addo, a trader who lived with her family at Tarkwa market circle was walking along the street towards her residents from Kawerekaananor when the accident occured.</p>
      <p>According to Inspector Osei, the suspect David Ampo, a 53 year-old knocked down the deceased who fell into a drain around the slaughter house.</p>
      <p>He indicated that a mobile money merchant who conducted business at  the accident spot claimed that she left the scene a few minutes to transact business with a client and while returning she heard a loud noise.</p>
      <p>The eye witness said when she got closer to the said drain, she saw the deceased with various degrees of injury on her body and she shouted for assistance.</p>
      <p>Inspector Osei said the butchers who were working, rushed to the scene with knives and sticks to assault and the suspect who sped off for fear of been lynched by the mob.</p>
      <p>He said the deceased was quickly rushed to the Apinto government hospital by some eye witnesses but she died around 12:30 am on Tuesday while on admission.</p>
