      <p>Jake Quickenden has been forced to pull out of Dancing On Ice's Christmas show after breaking a bone in his neck.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> star, 31, was set to take part in their festive special but has suffered a nasty injury which would mean it would be "dangerous" for him to dance.</p>
      <p>For the first time ever since the show began, ITV are airing a Dancing On Ice Christmas Special which is set to rival Strictly's yearly one.</p>
      <p>Jake, who won the show in 2018, was set to perform a routine alongside the likes of Ray Quinn and Gemma Collins.</p>
      <p>However Jake confirmed today that he has had to pull out of taking part after the medical team wouldn't give him the OK after his injury.</p>
