      <p>THE third annual Mayo on Ice skating rink promotion at the Mall in Castlebar this Christmas has been officially launched.</p>
      <p>The event will open on Friday afternoon November 29, and run for five weeks up to Sunday, January 5. Early bird tickets are currently on sale.</p>
      <p>Behind the venture is Castlebar Chamber of Commerce, backed by Mayo County Council and the local business sector.</p>
      <p>Promoter Brian McGee of Carousel Ireland Limited, Killarney, will move onto the site this week to begin work on assembling the facility.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the launch Mulroy's Bar and Restaurant, Mr. McGee said the project represented a big investment by his company.</p>
      <p>He cited the fact growing insurance and VAT costs is making it increasingly difficult to stage the event in Mayo's county town.</p>
      <p>But he remains greatly encouraged by the support he is receiving from Castlebar Chamber of Commerce and the council.</p>
      <p>“We also got fantasic support from the public and it's worth giving it another go. We also have a new attraction which wil be unvieled at the opening.”</p>
      <p>John Mulroy, president, Castlebar Chamber of Commerce, said it is a wonderful coup for Castlebar and the county to have the ice rink and other attractions back for the 2019 festival season in the heart of the town.</p>
      <p>“It's all part of our overall objective make the town the Christmas capital of the west for the benefit of our retail and commercial sectors . We are looking forward to significant numbers visiting and spending money in Castlebar over the festive season as a result of this initiative.</p>
      <p>Councillor Blackie Gavin, acting cathaoirleach, Castlebar Municipal District, said it is great to see everybody working together towards the betterment of the town.</p>
      <p>“It is a fillip for the confidence of the town that the event is happening again and the council was satisfied by the manner in which Mr. McGee and his staff repaired the surface of the Mall in the aftermath.”</p>
      <p>Christmas markets and food stalls to be located in close proximity to the ice rink to further enhance the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Wilson Bird, master of ceremonies, thanked the elected members and officials of Castlebar Municipal District for their support and extended a special welcome to John Condon, director of services, and Marie Crowley, head of the Castlebar Municipal District, for their attendance at the launch.</p>
      <p>The ice rink is being sponsored by The Connaught Telegraph, First Choice Credit Union, Mayo County Council and Mid West Radio.</p>
      <p>The Christmas lights in Castlebar will also be turned on a week earlier this year, on Friday, November 22.</p>
