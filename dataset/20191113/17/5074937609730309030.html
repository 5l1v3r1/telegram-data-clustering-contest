      <h1>Government’s promise of ensuring security is on course – Minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:01:29+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Philip Tengzu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Nandom (U/W), Nov. 13, GNA – Mr Ambrose Dery, the Minister of the Interior, has said government is committed to ensuring that peace and security prevails in the country to enable the people to carry out their daily activities without fear or panic.</p>
      <p>“Let me reassure you that his Excellency the President’s promise to make every Ghanaian secure and safe is on course, we are going to achieve it”, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Dery said this at Nandom during a “meet the press” encounter, held to deliberate on activities of the government and development partners to improve the livelihoods of the people in the Nandom District.</p>
      <p>The Minister said the frequent armed robbery cases recorded in the Upper West Region for instance, has reduced due to the interventions of government in the sector.</p>
      <p>He said government has provided vehicles to the police as well as recruited more police personnel to boost the efforts of the police service to fight crime effectively.</p>
      <p>Mr Dery recounted the arrest of a leader of a gang in the Upper West Region, who killed a police man and an assembly member and has been on the police wanted list for years.</p>
      <p>“We also know that there is a perennial problem with the security service, especially the police, that if you transfer them to the northern regions and certain parts of the Brong Ahafo Region, they do not want to come”, he said.</p>
      <p>He said personnel who accept transfer to areas that “are supposed to be unattractive will get their promotion one year ahead of their colleagues in other areas”.</p>
      <p>Mr Dery said ensuring security is a collective responsibility and that government would continue to equip the security agencies to do their work effectively.</p>
      <p>On his part, Dr Hafiz Bin Salih, the Upper West Regional Minister, urged the media personnel to be circumspect in their reportage and to project the positive image of the region to the outside world.</p>
      <p>He called on the media to cross-check and verify information they gather to ensure that whatever they are putting in the public domain would be the true representation of the issues on the ground.</p>
