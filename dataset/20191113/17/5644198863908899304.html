      <p>WELLINGTON: New Zealand lawmakers voted Wednesday (Nov 13) in favour of making euthanasia legal, paving the way for the issue to be put to voters in a referendum next year.</p>
      <p>The law, enabling terminally ill people to request a medically assisted death was passed 69-51 at its final reading, ending years of passionate debate in parliament.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has publicly stated her support for euthanasia reform and reluctantly voted for the referendum saying it was the only way of advancing the legislation.</p>
      <p>The referendum was a demand of the New Zealand First Party, which threatened to vote against the legislation if it wasn't put to the public - possibly condemning it to fail.</p>
      <p>"New Zealanders elect us, but they do not elect our consciences," New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin said.</p>
      <p>The bill sponsor, libertarian MP David Seymour, said before the vote he was confident it would be passed.</p>
      <p>"We've had the arguments - I don't think anyone will ever be able to say that parliament didn't properly scrutinise this bill," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's been nearly two years since the parliamentary process started. And over that time we've kicked around every conceivable argument for and against the bill."</p>
      <p>While MPs voted, protesters against euthanasia - carrying placards reading "assist us to live not die" and "euthanasia is not the solution" - staged a vigil outside parliament.</p>
