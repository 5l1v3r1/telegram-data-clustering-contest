      <p><b>Hyderabad</b>: Popular Telugu actor Rajasekhar escaped with minor injuries after his car overturned on outer ring road in Hyderabad post Tuesday midnight. Rajasekhar was himself driving the car and was alone when the accident took place near Pedda Golconda area. <br/><br/>Police found liquor and water bottles in the car. The car was said to be at a speed of over 160km when the accident took place around 2.30 am on Wednesday. <br/><br/>Rajasekhar said he suffered minor injuries and is alright. His wife Jeevitha also released a video message stating the accident was major but Rajasekhar escaped with a minor scratch on his forehead. <br/><br/>The hero was returning from Ramoji Film City on the city outskirts to his house around 2.30 am. The speed was such that his black Mercedes Benz got completely mangled. Air bags opened in time and saved him. A family of four proceeding in a car in the opposite direction noticed and extended help by pulling him out through the windshield. <br/><br/><br/>Shamshabad rural police inspector R Venkatesh said the actor managed to escape unhurt and reached home with the help of people in another car. The police could not confirm if the actor was drunk when the accident took place. <br/><br/>Jeevitha said the police had asked Rajasekhar to give his statement at his convenience. <br/><br/><br/>Rajasekharâ€™s car has three challans --- one in Rachakonda commissionerate and two in Cyberabad commissionerate limits -- pending for over speed/ dangerous driving in four months since July. This time too, the accident is on account of over speed.</p>
