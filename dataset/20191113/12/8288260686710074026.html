      <p>A dog walker was left stunned after seeing this massive RHEA bird - in a forest already known as the capital of Britain's booming wild boar population.</p>
      <p>Shocked Jason Burford was out walking his dog Molly in the Forest of Dean when he stumbled upon the huge 6ft avian.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old was stopped in his tracks by the sight of the bird rounding a corner.</p>
      <p>He then advanced towards creature and filmed it on his phone before it eventually ran off into the distance.</p>

      <p>An animal expert has confirmed it is likely the bird escaped from a local collection.</p>
      <p>Jason has already seen wild boar in the area which is currently one of the centres of the UK's booming population.</p>
      <p>Boars there have attacked animals, people, dug up gardens and playing fields and have even learned when bin day is so they can rummage in them for food.</p>

      <p>British woodlands are increasingly populated with exotics species - including parrots, wallabies and big cats.</p>
      <p>Jason, who keeps chickens and bantams at home, said: "I hadn't been there for years but I went on a whim as I used to live there.</p>
      <p>"I just rounded the corner and there it was. I'm used to it though, living in the forest. I wasn't worried.</p>

      <p>"The dog is good around other animals. But, for someone else, it could have been a shock.</p>
      <p>"It could have done an untrained dog some damage. Some don't even come back to their owners in the garden.</p>
      <p>"It's a funny story but it could have been nasty. I was just trying to get it off the track."</p>

      <p>Retired Jason, from Cinderford, Glos., said the bird was almost six feet tall from where he was standing - making for an imposing sight.</p>
      <p>He added: "I stopped videoing but you want to see it with its feathers fully stretched out!"</p>
      <p>Mr Burford claims that the bird escaped from a nearby field where some animals had been abandoned.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "I've since discovered where it came from. It's been reported to the RSPCA."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Rheas are not the only large animals to be running free in the Forest of Dean.</p>
      <p>The area has also suffered problems with aggressive wild boars in recent years - something Mr Burford has experienced firsthand.</p>

      <p>He said: "I have had them run at me and chase the dog. You don't want that happening. They really frighten you.</p>
      <p>"Once the dog ran off into the bushes and a huge boar suddenly appeared. Well the dog came straight at me - so the boar came too!</p>
      <p>"I'd watched a film about bears the night before and it said what you have to do is make yourself big and scream 'AAAARGH' so I thought I'd do that.</p>
      <p>"The boar just stopped in its tracks and left! They're a pain in the a**."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds confirmed the bird was a rhea yesterday (Tues).</p>
      <p>She added that is had likely escaped from a local collection.</p>
      <p>Jason spotted the bird on November 3 in the area of Drybrook, Glos. Molly is a cross between a Border Collie and a Labrador.</p>
