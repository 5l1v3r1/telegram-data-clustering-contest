      <p>A new study carried out to commemorate Stress Awareness Day has shown that for people in Ayrshire our twenties are the most worrying times of our lives.</p>
      <p>The research, carried out by insurance brokers, Lifesearch, found out that young adults in their twenties today have different worries compared to the baby boomers of yesterday.</p>
      <p>Modern twenty-somethings found themselves worrying about the future of the planet and climate change where as the twenty-somethings of years gone by worried more about nuclear war global conflict.</p>

      <p>Following on from their research, <a href="https://www.lifesearch.com/">Lifesearch</a> expert Emma Walker has shared five top tips to help combat stress, whatever your age.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Don’t compare and despair</b>
      </p>
      <p>Social media has a tendency to rose-tint everyday life, however it’s important to take a step back and realise social media posts don’t represent the whole story. In reality, those you follow are probably facing many of the same issues as you, they’re just not shouting about them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Put things into perspective</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s natural to be worried about things that are out of your control, be it climate change or politics. But catastrophizing won’t help relieve stress. Instead, focus on the little things you can do to help, recycle where possible and make sure you go down and vote on election day. Nobody can change the world alone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Don’t put your head in the sand</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our research reveals that one in seven people lie to themselves about the state of their own mental health. But it's important to be truthful to yourself, and by extension those around you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Recognise your triggers</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s important to recognise what might be feeding your stress. Common triggers include alcohol, a bad diet and a lack of sleep. With this in mind, try and be as healthy as possible – limit your alcohol intake, eat a balanced diet and aim for six to eight hours of restorative sleep each night.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Be protected in every eventuality</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fear of the unknown is felt by many of us; in fact our research shows that worries about the future rank highly for people of all ages. But there’s something we can do about this. Protecting yourself in the event of illness, accident or unknown events can.</p>
