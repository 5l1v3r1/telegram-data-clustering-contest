      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> are desperate to return to South Africa with a positive result, says midfielder <b>Dean Furman</b>.</p>
      <p>The national team are currently in <b>Ghana </b>preparing to take on the <b>Black Stars </b>as the <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualifying campaign kicks off this week.</p>
      <p>In Group C, Bafana Bafana are accompanied by Ghana, Sudan and the lowly ranked São Tomé and Príncipe.</p>
      <p>On <b>Thursday, November 14</b> Ghana welcomes <b>Molefi Ntseki's</b> Bafana Bafana charges to the Cape Coast Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>The match starts at <b>21:00</b> (SA time).</p>
      <p>"There is a clean bill of health. Everyone is looking forward to playing," said Furman ahead of the much-anticipated fixture.</p>
      <p>"I think tonight is going to be a very important (training) session, so we can acclimatise and get used to the heat and the environment.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully, (we) get to work on some tactics because it is going to be a very difficult game."</p>
      <p>During the 2019 AFCON qualifying campaign, South Africa qualified from Group E without any defeat along with African giants Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Bafana Bafana beat the Super Eagles 2-0 in Uyo courtesy of goals from Tokelo Rantie and Percy Tau.</p>
      <p>Furman believes that the away victory against Nigeria worked in Bafana's favour and hopes that they can inflict similar damage against the Black Stars in Ghana.</p>
      <p>"We're definitely looking to come away with something. A win would be fantastic, and a point would be a great result because Ghana are also a top nation on this continent with some great players," said Furman.</p>
      <p>"We want to come away with something. We've travelled long and hard to get here. We want something to show for our efforts.</p>
      <p>"We want to get off to a good start and then come home. I think our home form is going to be key for us in qualification."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt, Bafana shocked the world in knocking out the host nation in the last 16.</p>
      <p>That victory came under the tutelage of Stuart Baxter, who has since resigned as head coach.</p>
      <p>The Ghana clash will be Ntseki's second match in charge since his interim gig was made permanent by the South African Football Association (SAFA) in August.  </p>
      <p>His first official match in the dugout was a 2-1 victory over Mali in the Nelson Mandela Challenge last month.</p>
      <p>Furman claims that Bafana Bafana's progress at AFCON earlier this year along with the win over Mali has signaled to the rest of the continent that South Africa are a "force to be reckoned with".</p>
      <p>"That's got to be the attitude going into this game (against Ghana). We don’t want to fear them," Furman continued.</p>
      <p>"We give them respect but we certainly believe that on our day we’re a match for anyone and can cause anyone problems."</p>
