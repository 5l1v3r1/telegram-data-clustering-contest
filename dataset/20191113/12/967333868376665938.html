      <p>The Indian rupee has depreciated by 30 paise to 71.77 against the US dollar in early trade on Wednesday, amid weak industrial output numbers, which recorded an eight-year low earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The rupee opened at 71.75 against the US dollar at the interbank foreign exchange. It further slipped to 71.77.</p>
      <p>The Indian Index of Industrial Production (IIP) or, factory output, for the month of September, contracted by 4.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>The IIP had seen a contraction of 1.4% in August this year. This is its <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201911051077221839-ex-rbi-governor-uncertain-of-finance-ministrys-bullish-predictions-for-economic-recovery-/">weakest performance in seven years</a> due to the decline in manufacturing, mining and electricity sectors, according to the latest government statistics released on Monday.</p>
      <p>India’s macroeconomic outlook remains grim with the country's largest public-sector lender, State Bank of India predicting a sub 5% gross domestic product growth in the second quarter of the current financial year in a report released on Tuesday.</p>
      <blockquote>“We expect second quarter GDP growth at 4.2 percent,” the report said, while terming the decline in September IIP by 4.3 percent as “quite alarming”.</blockquote>
      <p>The rupee had declined against the dollar on Monday, after rating agency Moody’s downgraded India's outlook last week.</p>
