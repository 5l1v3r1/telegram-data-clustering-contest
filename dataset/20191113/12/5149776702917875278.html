      <p>A Bulwell man has made a 23-minute court appearance via video on a charge of the murder of neighbour Daniel Mock.</p>
      <p>The charge was not read to Shane Seymour, 44, who was represented by QC Michael Auty at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a>.</p>
      <p>A trial has been set for January 13 with an estimate that it will last for five days.</p>
      <p>Another preparation hearing will be held on December 12. Mr Auty told the court that he was working on a list of witnesses required for the trial.</p>
      <p>Mary Loram QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said they were getting ready to hand case papers to the defence team.</p>
      <p>The charge is that Mr Mock, 37, was murdered in Spruce Gardens, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bulwell">Bulwell</a>, on August 2. Both men lived on the street.</p>
      <p>Judge John Burgess told Seymour that barristers had been dealing with details of the case during the hearing.</p>
      <p>He added: "We have discussed everything we need to and there will be another hearing on December 12."</p>
      <p>Seymour, who wore a grey top and a ring in his left ear, appeared to have followed the hearing.</p>
      <p>His only word was "yes" when asked to confirm his name.</p>
      <p>It was his second appearance at the crown court. Before that he was brought before three magistrates in the city.</p>
