      <h3>FOR faster completion of the Build Build Build projects, a House leader is proposing special powers that would allow President Rodrigo Duterte  to speed up the implementation of the program.</h3>
      <p>Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, filed House Bill 5456 or An Act Granting special powers to help the President implement and complete the Build Build Build program on or before 2022 or within the period of two and a half years subject to restrictions.</p>
      <p>The Build Build Build is a program launched in 2019 aimed at ushering in the golden age of infrastructure in the country. It is the largest and broadest infrastructure spending program ever undertaken by any Philippine government.</p>
      <p>At least P4.3 trillion is allocated to 100 priority infrastructure.</p>
      <p>However, due to several consequences, completion of some projects was hindered.</p>
      <p>According to Salceda, this is the reason why the President needs special powers to fast track the implementation of the infrastructure program which would spur inclusive growth.</p>
      <p>The program of the Duterte administration will likewise reduce poverty by 14 percent by 2022.</p>
      <p>Senator Franklin Drilon has dismissed the Build Build Build program of the Duterte administration as a dismal failure, saying only seven out of 75 proposals have been started.</p>
      <p>“The immediate implementation of   the Build, Build, Build program will complement meaningfully the economic and social legislations that were already passed by Congress designed to accelerate the country’s growth rate, change the socio-economic structures, ensure ecological integrity and achieve peace and security,” Salceda said.</p>
      <p>In a press conference, Salceda clarified that the proposed special powers could only be used by two major agencies in-charge of the infrastructure projects – the Department of Transportation (DoTr) and the Department of Public Works and Highways.</p>
      <p>The “Build, Build, Build” program is a work in progress but could be faster by easing procurement rigidities and resolving the right of way problem, Salceda added.</p>
      <p>Contrary to Drilon’s claim, Salceda said that “out of the 75 of the original, 46 are being implemented as of 2019 mainly GAA-funded plus the eight PPP projects – a total of 54 projects.</p>
