      <p>Disney's hotly anticipated streaming service launched in the US … and was immediately hit with technical glitches.</p>
      <p>Some people who tried to access the service were greeted by an image of Mickey Mouse on a blue screen, with a message asking them to exit the app and try again.</p>
      <p>Others got different versions of Disney's cast of characters trying to deal with the technical difficulties.</p>

      <p>Some users reported <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/12/20955914/disney-plus-down-slow-launch-day-the-mandalorian-error-76">waiting up to 30 minutes to start streaming their chosen show or film.</a></p>
      <p>The service launches next week on November 19 in Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>Most of Europe won't be able to sign up until March, 2020.</p>
      <h3>Disney said the service was too popular</h3>
      <blockquote>"The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our highest expectations ... we are aware of the current user issues and are working to swiftly resolve them," the company said in a statement.</blockquote>
      <p>Disney didn't give an indication of how many people successfully signed up or how many had difficulty accessing the service. But plenty did manage to access the service without a problem.</p>
      <p>Before the launch, Disney's president of streaming services, Michael Paull, said his team was "thinking very much about" the potential for launch day glitches, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20831284/disney-plus-overload-crash-hbo-now-espn-launch-day">according to The Verge</a>.</p>
      <p>The same technology that powers Disney+ is behind HBO's offering and the streaming offering from US sports broadcasting giant ESPN.</p>
      <p>Disney+, the House of Mouse's big splash into the streaming market, features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company's long catalogue as well as new programming.</p>
      <h3>I'm just here for The Mandalorian. Is it good?</h3>
      <p>Apparently so!</p>
      <p>The eagerly awaited series is one of the flagship titles for Disney+, and reviews of the first episode are good.</p>
      <p>More than <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_mandalorian/s01">90 per cent of critics have given the episode a positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes</a> (and it's got an audience score of 94 per cent).</p>
      <p>The show is following a traditional release schedule of one episode per week, rather than the steaming norm of releasing entire seasons at one time.</p>
      <p>Good luck avoiding spoilers for another week.</p>
      <h3>It's not the only Star Wars people are talking about</h3>
      <p>Every Star Wars movie (except The Last Jedi, which is still streaming on Netflix until the end of the year), is available on Disney+.</p>
      <p>But eagle eyed-fans noticed something odd when watching the classic that started it all, 1977's A New Hope.</p>
      <p>The scene where viewers are introduced to Han Solo inside a Mos Eisley cantina has been changed for the fourth time in the Disney+ version of the film.</p>
      <p>In the 1977 original, Han Solo shoots bounty hunter Greedo after a short confrontation.</p>
      <p>Since the 1977 original, the scene has been modified three times by Star Wars creators George Lucas to show Greedo shooting first and adding an awkward dodge by Han.</p>
      <p>It's a sore point in the Star Wars fandom, and was even referenced in 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story.</p>
      <p>But the Disney+ version mixes things up again by adding a new line from Greedo in an alien language and new laser effects that show the pair firing simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Disney's confirmed the new changes were … again … added by George Lucas before it acquired Lucasfilm in 2012.</p>
