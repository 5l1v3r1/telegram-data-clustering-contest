      <h1>Motorola's foldable display RAZR leaks ahead of today's launch</h1>
      <h2>Take a look at that chin.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:29:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/igor-bonifacic" target="_blank">Igor Bonifacic</a></address>
      <p>Motorola's upcoming foldable display RAZR has leaked just hours before the company is likely to announce it at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/17/motorola-razr-invite/">an event in Los Angeles</a>. These new photos of the phone come courtesy of a <a href="https://fccid.io/IHDT56XM1">Federal Communications Commission certification</a>. And while they don't reveal much about the phone we didn't already know, they do provide us with our best look at the device yet.</p>
      <p>Most notable is the bottom of the phone, which features a USB-C port for data transfer and charging. Like most modern smartphones, the new RAZR doesn't appear to include a headphone jack. The V3i, the model most people think of when they think back to the original RAZR, didn't have a headphone jack either -- but then that was a different time before feature phones shipped with enough internal storage to hold music. Call it an unintended callback.</p>
      <p>Besides a very noticeable notched display, the phone also features very prominent side hinges that cut into its side bezels. <i><a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/motorola-razr-2019/">MySmartPrice</a>, </i>the first publication to spot the photos, speculates this design quirk could be limited to the pre-production model the FCC photographed, but this seems unlikely. If you compare these new photos with the official-looking ones that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/31/motorola-foldable-display-razr-leaks-official-looking-images/">leaked late last month</a>, you can see they're prominent in those photos as well.</p>

      <p>What the images don't provide is a clue as to what button located on the chin phone of does. <i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962963/motorola-foldable-razr-fcc-listing-leaked-images">The Verge </a></i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962963/motorola-foldable-razr-fcc-listing-leaked-images">suggests</a> the button could act as both a power switch and a capacitive fingerprint sensor, which seems like a reasonable bet.</p>
      <p>Alongside the photos that leaked last month, there was also a report that said the new RAZR would feature a Snapdragon 710 processor with up to 6GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/16/motorola-razr-foldable-phone/">report from <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> </a>from earlier in the year also said the phone will be a Verizon (Engadget's parent company) exclusive that the carrier sells for approximately $1,500. The good news is that most of our questions about the phone will likely be answered in the next couple of hours.</p>
