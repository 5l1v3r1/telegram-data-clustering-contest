      <p>Cape Town – Charlize Theron recently shared a video of Boyz II Men performing at a fundraising event and called it the highlight of her life.</p>
      <p>The <i>Bombshell</i> star wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4y0rd6h6WA/"><b>Instagram</b></a>, "I’ve gotten to see @boyziimen live twice in one year and honestly can say it’s a highlight of my life.</p>
      <p>"SO much fun tonight at our @ctaop fundraising event. Thanks to these incredible dudes for closing out the night in the best way and to everyone who showed up and helped raised funds to protect the youth of South Africa."</p>
      <p>In the short video, the Academy Award-winning actress pans the room showing guests clearly enjoying themselves, before the camera switches to her singing along.</p>
      <p>In the next clip, she gives her most passionate performance as she sings along to Boyz II Men’s <i>End Of The Road</i> – and that, is the highlight of our lives.</p>

      <p>The fundraising event was for the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP), which focuses on investing in youth and their future by fighting HIV in South Africa. The event happened at the Africa Center in New York City and was attended by many celebrity guests, including our very own former Miss Universe, Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters.</p>
      <p>Demi shared a video of Charlize talking about the theme of the evening: ubuntu.</p>
      <p>"I am because you are. It’s a belief in our universal bond as humans that we’re all interconnected," Charlize explained. "This spirit and the culture of South Africa really shaped who I am today. And I always knew that I wanted to return some of the gift given to me back to the incredible country and people of South Africa."</p>
