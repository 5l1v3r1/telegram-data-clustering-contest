      <h1>Celtic skipper Scott Brown takes social media 'village idiots' to task over horrific abuse</h1>
      <h2>The 34-year-old reckons the time is now to make significant change and banish the louts tarnishing the sport.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:13:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Defiant <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> insists social media keyboard warriors and yobs at who attend matches will never win in their quest to ruin the beautiful game.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> skipper has delivered a crystal clear message and has called on parents to cut out terrace abuse to protect the next generation.</p>
      <p>Brown, who once again pledged his support to players who are considering coming out as gay, believes modern technology is acting as a deterrent to those looking to leave a stain on our game.</p>
      <p>A teenager was charged in September over alleged abuse aimed at the 34-year-old in the aftermath of his side's 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> .</p>

      <p>Brown insists the time is now to make significant changes in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> and beyond.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://talksport.com/">talkSPORT</a> : "Social media, there's always going to be the village idiot, should we say.</p>
      <p>"There's always going to be that one person in a crowd, it's part and parcel of the game but it shouldn't be</p>
      <p>"Everyone thinks they can go into the stands and shout, do what they want for 90 minutes and then it's forgotten about.</p>
      <p>"But now there is so much CCTV, people catching others on their phones. It's good that it's getting the recognition it has been in recent weeks.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"It's more individuals, one person thinks they can shout what they want for 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>"You're showing your son, you're showing your family the way you think is right and they are coming home from games and they can shout that at a stranger and think it's ok.</p>
      <p>"I think when I've got kids, I think I am the role model for them and I've got to make sure they are in the best environment as well.</p>
      <p>"Football is becoming more a family sport as well, everyone is going to it and everyone is enjoy it.</p>

      <p>"It's a great time just now to try and do something about it."</p>
      <p>The Hoops hero also took time out to praise former boss Brendan Rodgers and the job he is doing with Premier League top four contenders Leicester.</p>
      <p>He added:  "He is a man who knows what he wants and how he wants his team to play.</p>
      <p>"He can put an arm around you but he can also tell you where you need to work harder.</p>
      <p>"Leicester have been doing fantastic this season and that is all down to Brendan and his backroom staff.</p>
      <p>"It shows what a top quality manager he is and how lucky we were to have him.</p>
      <p>"I think for him he's done incredible and he's got that belief in himself too."</p>
