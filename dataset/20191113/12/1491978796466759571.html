      <p>Cuba's strange dual system means that public sector workers and those in private enterprise are paid in different currencies. Laura, a GP, earns Cuban pesos, whereas Rogelio, who was a doctor, now makes more in an hour as a taxi driver than he used to in a month because he is paid in 'convertible pesos', which are worth 24 times more. As doctors and teachers struggle to buy basic goods, is it time for change?</p>
