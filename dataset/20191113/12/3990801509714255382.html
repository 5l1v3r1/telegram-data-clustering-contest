      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:15:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/tnwdeals/" target="_blank">TNW Deals</a></address>

      <p>The US graphic design industry will account for almost $15 billion worth of business in 2019. And while that’s a ginormously big number, consider this fact, too: <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/graphic-designers-industry">almost 90 percent of that business is done by freelance graphic artists</a>.</p>
