      <h1>New Samsung tablet (SM-T307U) discovered, here are some details</h1>

      <p>Amidst the insane number of smartphones it has been launching in the last few months, Samsung continues to find time to make a few tablets as well. The Wi-Fi Alliance has revealed the existence of a new tablet from the company. A Samsung SM-T307U was <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/product-finder-results?sort_by=certified&amp;sort_order=desc&amp;keywords=SM-T307">certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance last week</a> both as a tablet and as a router, and at this time, very little is known about the device.</p>
      <h3>32GB of storage, Android Pie, and just one color option</h3>
      <p>Our sources tell us the SM-T307U’s color options include just brown and it has 32GB of on-board storage. The Wi-Fi certification reveals it runs Android Pie; it supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks, and the ‘7’ in the model number indicates it will have cellular connectivity. Unfortunately, it’s not known what the tablet will be called. The SM-T3xx model number series is usually reserved for Samsung’s 8-inch tablets, and the SM-T307U could be part of the Galaxy Tab A lineup.</p>
      <p>We don’t see any signs of a variant of the SM-T307 for markets outside the US, so it remains to be seen if it will be a globally sold device or one that’s limited to North America (and possibly Sprint). As always, we’ll keep an eye out for more information and let you know as soon as we find something.</p>
