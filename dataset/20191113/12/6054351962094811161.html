      <p>Los Angeles, CA – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53452/title.kodak-black-sentenced-in-weapons-case">Kodak Black’s legal trouble</a> had nothing to do with him getting cut from <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53377/title.dave-east-enlists-nas-dj-premier-rick-ross-more-for-survival-tracklist">Dave East’s <i>Survival</i></a> album. In an interview with REAL 92.3’s Big Boy, East revealed he removed Kodak from the LP due to the incarcerated rapper <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50959/title.kodak-black-sort-of-apologizes-for-disrespecting-lauren-london">disrespecting Lauren London</a> and the late <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53179/title.nipsey-hussles-family-granted-guardianship-of-his-daughter">Nipsey Hussle</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The Def Jam artist made it clear he didn’t have any personal issues with Kodak, but his friendship with Nipsey made the collaboration untenable.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have a problem with Kodak, personally,” East noted. “I don’t even know him like that. We met maybe twice. I made the XXL cover with him. We was on that together. But me and Nip, like I said when you asked me, it was deeper than rap. So anybody, I don’t care who it might’ve been, don’t speak on that man after that man gone if it’s not in a good light. Don’t speak on that man’s woman, that man’s kids. Don’t bring that man up. That’s just my opinion on it. Take it how you want to.”</p>

      <p>Kodak was originally supposed to appear on the <i>Survival</i> cut “Night Shift,” which features Lil Baby. But East felt he couldn’t pay proper tribute to Nipsey on an album with Kodak as a guest.</p>
      <p>“I had a record, it was actually ‘Night Shift,'” he explained. “I had a Lil Baby on it and Kodak put a verse on it. Just sitting back listening to it, it was dope. But I just couldn’t have a song called ‘The Marathon Continues’ where I’m talking to my brother and he’s on it and then a few songs before that … that’s just me, man. I’m a loyal dude, I’m real. I don’t hold my tongue. I ain’t got no filter. That’s just me. The internet gonna spin it however they wanna spin it, but like I said, I don’t have a problem with homie. Free Kodak Black for real.”</p>
      <p>In East’s mind, a Kodak collaboration would’ve made his support for Nipsey look disingenuous.</p>
      <p>“My integrity is what I stand on,” he stated. “So it’s like, at the end of the day, I can’t be out here waving that flag [for Nipsey] and then I go do that. That’s crazy. To anybody that’s from that camp that love me or got real love and support for me, how I look? How I really look? So, I couldn’t do that.”</p>
