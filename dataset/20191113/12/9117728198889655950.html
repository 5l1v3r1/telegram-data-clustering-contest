      <h1>Honda desperate for "clean and fair" Formula 1 engine battle</h1>

        <b>With the controversy surrounding <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari%20">Ferrari</a> at the moment, with the legality questions still around their power unit; Honda's F1 technical director Toyoharu Tanabe has had his say on the matter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ever since <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc%20">Charles Leclerc</a>'s win at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/belgian-grand-prix%20">Belgian Grand Prix</a>, Ferrari have been dominant in the second half of the 2019 season and their qualifying pace and race-pace has been quicker than anyone else's.</p>
      <p>However, Scuderia have come under serious scrutiny in recent weeks, and there have been allegations made - <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/49393/verstappen-has-a-go-at-ferrari-that-s-what-happens-when-you-stop-cheating-.html">most noticeably by Max Verstappen</a> - that the Italian manufacturer have found a gap in the rules to improve their power unit.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull Racing</a> wrote to the FIA during the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a> weekend about Ferrari's engine and its legality and the governing body confirmed the energy drink-brand's proposal was illegal, with Scuderia still claiming there is nothing illegal about their engine.</p>
      <p>Honda's Tanabe has said all he wants is a "clean and fair" battle between the engine suppliers in F1. When asked by <i>Motorsport.com </i>if Honda welcomed the FIA's refusal of Red Bull's approach, he replied: <i>"There are some ways to improve performance of the engine, and the chassis, using grey areas or techniques, fuel, oil burning - something like that.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We are very keen to have a fair race under the FIA/Formula 1 regulations, respecting the regulations. That's our desire. To have that clean, fair race, we need FIA policing."</i>
