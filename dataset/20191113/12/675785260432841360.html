      <h2>WARNING - CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES OF SURGERY: The former Celebrity Big Brother star has undergone yet another dramatic surgical procedure in a bid to make his bum look bigger</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:13:49+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rodrigo-alves">Rodrigo Alves</a> has undergone a dramatic surgical procedure to remove his fake six-pack and have it put into his bum to make it look bigger.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> star - better known as the Human Ken Doll - has gone under the knife dozens of times in a bid to completely transform his look.</p>
      <p>But in one of his most radical moves ever, the 36-year-old has had his infamous fake six-pack taken out and the fat inserted into his backside to give him a Brazilian Bum Lift.</p>
      <p>And he did it all on camera for a German TV documentary.</p>
      <p>The reality personality told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7677533/Human-Ken-Doll-fake-six-pack-REMOVED-inserted-BACKSIDE.html?ico=pushly-notifcation-small">MailOnline</a> that eight years on from his Abdominal Etching procedure in Brazil, he decided he was done with his six-pack.</p>

      <p>He said: "As much as people thought that it was amazing I don't think that it passed on the right message since I didn’t work out for it I just payed for it.</p>
      <p>"Also, the six-pack didn’t match the rest of my body and started to look a bit silly!"</p>
      <p>Rodrigo visited the Comfort Zone surgery clinic in Istanbul, where Dr Serkan Balta performed a five-hour liposuction operation to remove his fake abs, taking out between three and five litres of fat from his belly and back.</p>

      <p>The fat was then inserted into his bum and hips to give him a fuller-looking derriere.</p>
      <p>Rodrigo added: "I see all my plastic surgeries as an evolution of me as a person! I never wanted to look like a Ken Doll or to be a Ken Doll. I just wanted to be unique and to show the world that in life anything is possible."</p>
      <p>He said he also wanted to prove that people don't have to live forever with the looks they're born with if it makes them unhappy.</p>

      <p>But he says that as he approaches 40, he's starting to see the world in a new light.</p>
      <p>He said he's still changing, "not just aesthetically but inside".</p>
      <p>Rodrigo said last month that he hopes his latest surgery will put him in the Guinness World Record book.</p>

      <p>He said that Guinness want to make a movie about him and his history of plastic surgery, and that they're trying to get hold of all the doctors who have worked on him over the years.</p>
