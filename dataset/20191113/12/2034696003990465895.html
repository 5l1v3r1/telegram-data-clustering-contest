      <p><i>Star Trek</i> star Patrick Stewart has shared his views on <a href="http://nme.com/tag/brexit">Brexit</a> during a panel, saying he’s “embarrassed” by the ongoing process.</p>
      <p>The actor was speaking at a Comic-Con in France in support of new show <i>Star Trek: Picard.</i></p>

      <p>As <i><a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/gabriel-hays/2019/11/11/patrick-stewart-embarrassed-brexit-tells-french-audience-its">Newsbusters</a></i> report, Stewart said: “For the last 35 years, I have been so proud to belong to a country that was part of the European Union. And I am embarrassed to stand here in front of you, representing a country that is seeking to break that invaluable connection.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I want you to know that well more than half of the population of the United Kingdom wants to stay in the European Union.</p>
      <p>“The Berlin Wall came down. The Soviet Union ended its dominance and control over so many nations. Apartheid was ended in South Africa. The Good Friday Agreement brought together [both] Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The European Union is all part of that movement, and it is a disgrace that individuals in my country are attempting to separate it.”</p>

      <p>It’s not the first time Stewart has made his feelings on Brexit known. Back in February, as reported by <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/brexit-patrick-stewart-peoples-vote-x-men-uk-eu-theresa-may-king-a8789731.html">The Independent</a></i>, he said: “I have reflected a great deal on it because I’m very involved in the remain campaign and have been for a couple of years.</p>
      <p>“It would be dishonest not to in a story like this, where people are trying to not only improve society, they also save society, and, oh Lord, do we need it saving now.”</p>
      <p>Stewart continued: “I am very alarmed, concerned, not to say actually scared of what is actually going to come out of this.</p>
      <p>“I am an optimist and always have been by nature, things will get better – but before they do it could get very very much worse and it concerns me that so many people seem not to be factoring that into this vote.”</p>
