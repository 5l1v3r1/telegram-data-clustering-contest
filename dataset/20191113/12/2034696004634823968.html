        <b>It's transformed into a classic duet.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> has shared her remix of ‘Lover’, which comes complete with a new verse from<a href="http://nme.com/artists/shawn-mendes"> Shawn Mendes.</a></p>
      <p>The title track from Swift’s seventh album is turned to a classic duet, as Mendes attempts to woo her with a list of romantic plans.</p>
      <p><i>“We can light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby/Pictures of when we were young hang on the wall/We’ll sit on the stoop/I’ll sing love songs to you,”  </i>Mendes sings.</p>
      <p>He later adds: <i>“See I finally got you/Now honey I won’t let you fall.”</i></p>

      <p>Despite releasing her seventh LP back in August, Swift recently said she won’t head out on a global tour in support of it – instead choosing to perform a string of select shows.</p>
      <p>She is also heavily linked with a headline slot <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/festivals-blog/glastonbury-2020-festival-dates-line-rumours-registering-tickets-beating-rush-2523006">at Glastonbury Festival next year</a>, where she is currently the bookies favourite to headline alongside Kendrick Lamar and Paul McCartney.</p>
      <p>In a four star review of ‘Lover’, NME’s Nick Levine wrote: “After 2017’s bitter and combative <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/review/taylor-swift-reputation-album-review-2158267">‘Reputation’</a>, she’s returned to the wide-eyed but incisive romantic pop that made her a superstar.</p>
      <p>“At 18 tracks long, ‘Lover’ is more sprawling and further from flawless than her 2014 pop crossover <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-taylor-swift-15754">‘1989’</a>. But it succeeds in spite of its clunkier moments because Swift’s melodies are frequently dazzling and her loved-up lyrics are ultimately quite touching.”</p>
