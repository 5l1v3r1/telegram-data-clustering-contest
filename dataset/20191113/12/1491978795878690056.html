      <p>Parts of a flood-stricken village in South <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> could be inaccessible to residents for up to three weeks, the local council said yesterday, as about 200 army staff were deployed across the region with more rain expected.</p>
      <p>Weather warnings are in place for much of England and part of Wales today amid fears that those worst affected will be hit for a second time. Personnel from the Light Dragoons laid down sandbags in Stainforth, near <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/doncaster">Doncaster</a>, yesterday, attempting to shore up the village’s bridge.</p>
      <p>Doncaster council said that about 1,900 people had been taken to safety in the village of Fishlake, one of the worst-hit places in the region. It said efforts were being made to increase pumping and get people back to their homes more quickly.</p>
      <p>But roads were still closed on Tuesday, and the Environment Agency warned that people whose homes were submerged should not attempt to access them. Residents were discouraged from doing so “in the strongest possible terms”.</p>
      <p>The council said: “The Environment Agency, supported by the emergency services, is working hard to recover the area for a safe return but this is going to take some time and the latest estimates suggest a safe return could be up to three weeks away for some residents.”</p>

      <p>Although five of the most serious “danger to life” alerts had been stood down along the river Don in South Yorkshire on Tuesday, 20 flood warnings remain in place and further downpours are forecast for today.</p>
      <p>A Met Office yellow weather warning for rain stretches across much of the country, with flood-hit parts of South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire likely to bear the brunt. The agency said there was a small chance that communities could be cut off completely, perhaps for several days, with a risk of fast-flowing or deep flood water causing a danger to life.</p>
      <p>The Met Office said there was a small chance of extensive flooding to homes and businesses and a slight chance of power cuts.</p>

      <p>The recovery effort was already well under way on Tuesday when, under pressure from opposition leaders, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> announced a package of measures to help. His visit to Stainforth yesterday drew criticism from locals who said that he should have visited the area earlier.</p>
      <p>One said: “It took you over five days. You should have been there Saturday morning, having a meeting, making sure these people get help and support. And I’m sorry, but your [Tuesday] announcements were a pittance.”</p>
      <p>Following the Cobra meeting on Tuesday, the prime minister had announced funding “to support the recovery efforts of local councils where households and businesses have been affected”.</p>
      <p>As well as the deployment of the armed forces personnel, the government said a community recovery grant would be available to local councils, equivalent to £500 per eligible household, and businesses would each be eligible for up to £2,500.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson visited Fishlake on Tuesday, outlining pledges to spend £5.6bn and £5bn respectively on flood defences.</p>
      <p>Sue Marshall, who has been unable to return to her house since she was evacuated on Saturday, said she hoped the political visits would lead to real help for those affected. She feared being flooded on Thursday, when more rain is forecast.</p>
      <p>“I’ve just said to Jo Swinson that it’s all very well her doing this but in a month’s time we’re going to be old news,” she said. “What we need to know is that in two months’ time, the MPs will revisit this and look at what has been done to stop it happening again. And my immediate concern is what are they doing now to stop it happening on Thursday.”</p>
