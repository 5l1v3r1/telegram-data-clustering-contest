      <h1>Tyson Fury responds to UFC champion Stipe Miocic's boxing call-out</h1>
      <h2>Fury must first face Deontay Wilder in their world title rematch in February - but then wants Miocic</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:31:50+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury is ready to answer Stipe Miocic's call for a boxing fight next year.</p>
      <p>Fury has long claimed he wants to cross over to mixed martial arts but UFC heavyweight champion Miocic wants to fight the Traveller in the ring.</p>
      <p>Miocic has been linked with a trilogy fight with Daniel Cormier but would rather face Fury.</p>
      <p>"I saw <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> is coming into the mix now here,” Miocic said. “I like a new challenge.”</p>
      <p>"With DC, I didn't fluke knock him out. I beat him. I decisively beat him. That first fight, congrats to DC, but he caught me with a punch, first shot.</p>

      <p>"But that night, no excuses, he beat me. But the second fight, I won. I didn't get lucky I just worked him."</p>
      <p>And Fury, who recently trained alongside UFC middleweight Darren Till, said in response: "Stipe says he wants to box me. That would be a good fight for sure.</p>
      <p>"After I get Wilder out of the way I’ll fight Stipe in a boxing match if he wants it. It would be a big crossover fight like Mayweather and McGregor.”</p>
      <p>"I'm open to that fight so he should come and see me. It would be the same outcome for any of them, they'll all get smashed."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fury's dad has hit out at UFC president Dana White for suggesting his son could not compete in the cage.</p>

      <p>"I could probably smash Dana White with one punch," he told iFL TV.</p>
      <p>"How can he write my son off like that? Let him talk to me like that. I’ll fight him… Keep my son’s name out of your mouth.</p>
      <p>“How does he know about smashing anybody when Tyson comes from a smashing family, you know what I’m saying?</p>
      <p>"When I can probably smash Dana White with one punch, you know what I’m saying?</p>
      <p>"So how can he write my son off like that? You can’t write a man off with Tyson’s ability or heart or will to win, and he knows that. He’s talking stupid.</p>

      <p>“Let him talk to me like that. I’ll fight him. Match me up with him tonight, you know what I’m saying?</p>
      <p>"Because I believe I’m the best 54-year-old man in the world. I’m the fittest, I know that, and I’m the best 54-year-old man on the planet.</p>
      <p>"I’m going to prove it anytime, anywhere, for free or for money.</p>
      <p>"So let him take that in your pipe and smoke it. I mean that, mate. Keep my son’s name out of your mouth. If it’s not good, don’t talk about him.”</p>
