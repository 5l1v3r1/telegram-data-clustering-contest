      <h1>Bakkt Plans to Roll Out Cash-Settled Bitcoin Futures Contract</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:31:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) futures trading on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt">Bakkt</a> platform will expand to include a cash-settled option, COO Adam White has revealed.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Invest: NYC conference on Nov. 12, White <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-in-discussions-to-offer-cash-settled-bitcoin-futures-in-singapore">reportedly</a> stated that Bakkt “has the intention of offering a cash-settled contract as well” as its existing Bitcoin-settled product. </p>
      <h3>Customer demand spurring product development</h3>
      <p>According to unnamed sources reportedly familiar with the roadmap, the cash-settled monthly Bitcoin futures will be offered via ICE’s Singapore-based clearinghouse, ICE Clear Singapore, and traded on the ICE Futures Singapore exchange. The exchange is notably accessible to futures traders signed up to ICE anywhere worldwide.</p>
      <p>The sources claimed that ICE is in discussions with the city state’s de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, but is targeting a launch date before the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>The prospective cash-settled product was reportedly mooted in response to customer demand and will be based on data provided by Bakkt’s physically-settled contract.</p>
      <h3>The Bitcoin futures space</h3>
      <p>As previously reported, Bakkt’s much-anticipated contracts — the first of their kind to be physically settled in Bitcoin — first <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkts-much-anticipated-bitcoin-futures-trading-platform-goes-live">went live</a> this September.</p>
      <p>Numerous commentators have <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ices-bakkt-ceo-platform-wont-support-margin-trading-contracts-to-be-fully-collateralized">considered</a> that physically-delivered Bitcoin futures trading, which gives traders direct exposure to the asset, represents a leap forward for the institutional acceptance of the coin.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the anticipation, the platform’s underwhelming volumes in the first week following its launch were unfavorably <a href="https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1175567382032592896">compared</a> to the fiat-settled BTC futures on CME, which first launched back in December 2017. </p>
      <p>Volumes on Bakkt have <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkts-bitcoin-futures-trading-volume-soars-796-in-one-day-report">since</a> seen a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-set-to-smash-bitcoin-trading-volume-record-in-november">sizeable uptick</a>, however. Yesterday, 224 Bakkt Bitcoin monthly contracts were traded, according to tracking data <a href="https://twitter.com/BakktBot/status/1182201604990230530">compiled</a> by Twitter account Bakkt Volume Bot. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, almost <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance_futures">$882 million</a> is currently reported in daily traded volume for the Bitcoin/Tether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usdt">USDT</a>) perpetual contract on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-raises-max-margin-leverage-on-bitcoin-futures-to-125x">Binance Futures</a>.</p>
