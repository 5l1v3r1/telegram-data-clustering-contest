      <p>Firefox Lite 2.0 for Android launched with new features<br/>3.5 (70%) 6 votes</p>
      <p>Two years ago, we were talking about Firefox Rocket, an especially lightweight version of the Mozilla mobile browser for some regions of Asia and with some exclusive features not available in the normal version. It would later be renamed Firefox Lite and has recently reached version 2.0.</p>
      <p>It is another name, although the goal is the same: a light version of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/FireFox">Firefox</a> that is curiously based on Chromium instead of Mozilla’s own engine and includes several interesting developments such as Turbo mode, ads blocking and a screen capture of full web pages.</p>

      <p>Among the novelties of version 2.0, which for some reason is called “Firefox Lite Advanced Edition”. We have the new button to search for purchases directly from the browser in places like Google, Amazon or eBay. As well as more content integrated in the browser. It has more mini-games and more sources for news.</p>
      <p>Firefox Lite is officially available on <i><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.rocket">Google Play</a></i> in Indonesia, Philippines, India, China and Thailand, although you can download and install it without problems in other regions through its APK from sites from <i><a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/mozilla/firefox-rocket-fast-and-lightweight-web-browser/firefox-rocket-fast-and-lightweight-web-browser-2-0-216855-release/firefox-lite-fast-and-lightweight-web-browser-2-0-216855-android-apk-download/">APKMirror</a></i>. If you prefer not to install apps from outside Google Play. Firefox Focus is a similar browser, although it does not have additional content such as mini-games.</p>
