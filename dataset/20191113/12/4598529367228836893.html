      <p>The Trump campaign is paying special attention to its communications department, hiring and promoting to prepare for the double-headed onslaught of 2020 campaigning and the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-staffs-press-team-public-impeachment-hearings/story?id=66643614">According to ABC News,</a> the move includes internally promoting Capitol Hill veteran Erin Perrine and hiring Ali Pardo, who previously worked for the House Republicans and the President’s inauguration.</p>
      <p>The team is much more swampy than the 2016 group, as Trump has shifted to relying on longtime D.C. operatives rather than ragtag outsiders.</p>
      <p>Per ABC, they’ve grown the team to 16 people, sometimes marrying the two goals by using anti-impeachment messaging to rake in campaign cash.</p>
