      <p>‘Juliette’ is a standalone single released by Alex Toth’s latest project following his full-length debut, ‘Practice Magic and Seek Professional Help When Necessary.’ Describing the single as “punked out indie folk”, the track was composed for the film <i>Juliet</i>, <i>Naked</i>, starring Ethan Hawke. However, the song was ultimately never used for the film.</p>
      <p>Describing the song’s influences, Tōth said the song combines “the chamber pop melodicism of Belle &amp; Sebastian, the wistful lo-fi leanings of Bon Iver, and the anthemic sensibilities of The Lumineers.” The song itself is about honouring and respecting an ex-lover and is built around advice the band received from a friend: “We need to stop looking at every ended or changed relationship as a failure.”</p>
      <p>Now, Toth has shared the video for the song which features Ethan’s daughter, Maya. You can watch the video below:</p>

In an Instagram post earlier this week, Hawke shared that she wrote the lyrics for both tracks, while Jesse Harris, who has worked with the likes of <a href="http://nme.com/artists/norah-jones">Norah Jones</a> and Melody Gardot, wrote the music.</p>
