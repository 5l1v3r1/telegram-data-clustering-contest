      <h1>Inflation rate for October increases to 7.7 per cent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:55:52+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">Kodjo Adams, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA - The Year-on-year inflation rate for October increased slightly to 7.7 per cent, up by 0.1 percentage point from the 7.6 per cent recorded in September 2019.</p>
      <p>Professor Samuel Kobina Annim, the Government Statistician, who announced this on Wednesday, attributed the increase to prices in both bus fares and fuels.</p>
      <p>Food and non-alcoholic beverages recorded a year-on-year inflation rate of 7.0 per cent while the non-food group recorded a rate of 8.2 per cent.</p>
      <p>He said alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics recorded 13.2 per cent while transport recorded 12.9 per cent.</p>
      <p>Prof. Annim said between September and October 2019, the price level of food and non-alcoholic beverages went down slightly by -1.2 per cent.</p>
      <p>This decline was predominantly driven by a decline in price levels of vegetables and fruits.</p>
      <p>Inflation of imported goods was 8.9 per cent while that of local goods was 5.9 per cent on average.   </p>
      <p>On regional basis, three regions recorded inflation rates above the national average of 7.7 per cent and these were: Greater Accra, 11.8 per cent, Central, 9.2 per cent, and Volta, 8.9 per cent.</p>
      <p>Upper East Region recorded the lowest year-on-year inflation rate of 3.6 per cent in October 2019, Prof. Annim said.</p>
