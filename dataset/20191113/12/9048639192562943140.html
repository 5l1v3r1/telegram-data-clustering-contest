      <p><b>(CNN) -</b> Some scientists are calling it the "insect apocalypse."</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.somersetwildlife.org/sites/default/files/2019-11/FULL%20AFI%20REPORT%20WEB1_1.pdf">new report</a> from The Wildlife Trusts in the United Kingdom says the number of insects on our world is rapidly declining and more than 40% of bug species are facing extinction.</p>
      <p>This could have a devastating on the world food supply.</p>
      <p>"Three-quarters of our crops depend on insect pollinators. Crops will begin to fail. We won't have things like strawberries," said Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex in the UK and the author of the study.</p>
      <p>"We can't feed 7.5 billion people without insects."</p>
      <p>Goulson said there's still time to reverse the decline and suggests there are steps we can take to revive insect populations:</p>
      <p>-- Mow lawns less frequently<br/>-- Grow pollinator plants<br/>-- Avoid pesticide use<br/>-- Encourage others to do the same</p>
