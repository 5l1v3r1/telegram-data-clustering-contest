      <p>Prince Harry got some important advice from the Monaco royalty.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-prince-harry-reunite-kate-middleton-prince-william-remembrance-service/"><i>People</i></a>, Prince Albert revealed that he spoke with the British royal about his recent legal action against the press over allegedly invasive coverage.</p>

      <p>“I completely understand his reasons,” Albert said. “He has said he feels ‘bullied,’ and I can understand and sympathized with him over that. We didn’t talk about it that much, because we talked about environment-related issues…but I sympathized with him, saying, ‘Just do what you have to do to ensure your privacy.’“</p>
      <p>While they attended the World Cup Rugby final in Japan earlier this month, Albert told Harry that “sometimes you just have to ignore it and move on. Sometimes you can ignore whoever is out there that’s being too inquisitive or too hard on you.”</p>

      <p>Albert added, “You have to protect your personal life, your family and their intimacy as much as possible, whenever possible. Especially when you’re a public figure with appearances to attend. Of course, that’s harder to do than to say.</p>
      <p>“And it’s especially difficult with the British press, which is so inquisitive, so harsh. Not only on the Royal Family but on other celebrities and other public figures as well.”</p>
