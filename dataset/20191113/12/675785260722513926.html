      <h1>Urgent warning for anyone with a Mothercare voucher - spend it now or lose it</h1>
      <h2>You have until midnight to get to a store or online and spend any Mothercare vouchers you have after the failed child and baby goods chain revealed exactly when it would stop accepting them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:21:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Mothercare will stop letting people pay with gift cards and vouchers at midnight tonight.</p>
      <p>The mother and child goods specialist went into administration last week and is currently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/huge-queues-mothercare-launches-closing-20843316">in the middle of a closing down sale</a>.</p>
      <p>It has so far still been accepting gift cards, but now plans to stop.</p>
      <p>"Gift cards will be an accepted method of payment until midnight tonight. Thereafter gift cards will not be accepted," a notice on the website reads.</p>
      <p>Mothercare's administrator confirmed that stores are still accepting gift cards, but if you want to spend yours in person, it's worth checking closing times online.</p>

      <p>"Mothercare's collapse is all the more concerning because countless parents across the land will have been given vouchers and gift cards by friends and family," said James Walker, founder of consumer rights website <a href="https://www.resolver.co.uk/">Resolver.co.uk</a>.</p>
      <p>"I can't emphasise this enough: Spend them now."</p>
      <p>That's because when stores enter administration vouchers are classed as debts the store owes, and they are quite a long way down the list of people with claims on a former-company's money.</p>
      <p>"Chances are they'll be worthless," Walker said.</p>
