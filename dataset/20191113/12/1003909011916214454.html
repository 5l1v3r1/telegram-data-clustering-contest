      <h1>Opinion: If you want to reduce nurses' overtime, hire more nurses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:00:53+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>We have a solution to the overtime problem that Postmedia columnist Danielle Smith lamented in her Calgary Herald <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/smith-if-you-want-to-make-real-cuts-chop-public-sector-overtime">column</a> of Nov. 1: Hire more nurses.</p>
      <p>Smith is not wrong that Alberta nurses working too much overtime can be a problem, but the solution to this is not to simply ban overtime, rather for Alberta Health Services to hire more registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses to provide the level of patient care Albertans depend on.</p>
      <p>Yes, overtime is being paid, but it in no way reflects the amount of overtime that is actually being worked by Alberta nurses every single day. In fact, the United Nurses of Alberta has some of the highest rates of unpaid overtime in Canada.</p>
      <p>According to a recent UNA survey of front-line nurses, 39 per cent said they work overtime on every shift and 69 per cent said they never claim overtime for the overtime they actually worked.</p>
      <p>The large amount of overtime being paid out by AHS is a direct result of a decades-long nursing staffing shortage across the province. Part of the problem is that the employers will not post vacant positions, choosing instead to do “just-in-time staffing.”</p>
      <p>Asking shift-workers like nurses to change their schedules on short-notice can create big challenges. This is especially the case for nurses with young families requiring childcare or those caring for elderly parents or vulnerable family members.</p>
      <p>The answer to the overtime problem is simple: fill vacancies and hire enough nursing staff.</p>
      <p>UNA members have worked hard to help AHS and other health-care employers understand this problem.</p>
      <p>This was demonstrated last year when UNA and AHS reached an agreement to resolve a critical nursing staffing shortage in the emergency department at Red Deer Regional Hospital Centre that led to the creation of 11.7 full-time-equivalent RN positions.</p>
      <p>Before that situation was resolved, RNs in the Red Deer emergency department worked more than 230 hours of overtime in one weekend alone. Increasing the number of RNs dramatically decreased the amount of overtime being worked without sacrificing safe patient care; indeed, it improved it.</p>
      <p>Referring to documents produced by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Smith stated the maximum compensation for a registered nurse on an hourly basis is $58.81. It is unclear to us where this number comes from. A quick look at the UNA provincial collective agreement will show an RN at the very top of the salary grid would earn $49.34 per hour. This is a difference of about $20,000 per year.</p>
      <p>The correct numbers are easy to find: They are on Page 287 of the current UNA collective agreement with AHS and other health-care employers, a public document available on UNA’s website and from the Alberta Labour Relations Board.</p>
      <p>Demand for nurses in Alberta is increasing due to the steady growth of our population and an aging workforce, which will lead to many retirements in the coming years. As a result, employment growth in nursing is expected to be among the highest of all occupations.</p>
      <p>According to the government of Alberta’s Occupational Demand and Supply Outlook, demand will continue to outpace supply in nursing and our province could have a shortage of 5,234 nurses by 2025.</p>
      <p>Banning overtime while not filling vacant positions (vacancy management) as Alberta is faced with a growing shortage of nurses would be foolish at best and dangerous at worst.</p>
      <p>The misinformation included in Smith’s column and in the CTF document she refers to is an attempt to devalue the work of nurses who deliver care to Albertans every single day. Safe patient care is a priority for Alberta nurses, but that can only be accomplished through proper staffing levels.  </p>
      <p>Hiring more nurses will decrease overtime and improve patient care. It’s not complicated.</p>
