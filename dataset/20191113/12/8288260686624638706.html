      <p>Popular Tamworth driver Martin Plowman revved into action to surprise race partner Kelvin Fletcher on Strictly Come Dancing this week.</p>
      <p>Martin was shown on last Saturday’s show handing over Kelvin’s Championship trophy which he was unable to collect due to his Strictly commitments.</p>
      <p>The duo secured a sensational title victory in the ProAm class at the 2019 British GT Championship earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Martin explained: “With Kelvin on the show, the studio wanted to do a VT on his racing. They were going to do a segment where he would teach Oti (Mabuse, Kelvin’s dance partner) how to drive so he contacted me and said he needed help organising.</p>

      <p>“I rang around manufacturers and all of a sudden BBC said we needed to do it tomorrow! It was nerve wracking because I knew we only had one chance to capture the surprise. What if I fluffed my lines? But it went smoothly.</p>
      <p>“It was such a cool experience. I know Kelvin was gutted to have missed the awards banquet in Vegas, so I was proud to be able to personally present it to him in the middle of his Strictly journey.</p>

      <p>   </p>
      <p>“I wasn’t a big Strictly fan before but I have got involved because of him and now I am becoming a fan! I think he has shocked everybody, he has just got natural moves.</p>
      <p>“He is definitely one of the favourites now, whether he will win it or not I don’t know but he is certainly in with a shout. There are so many top dancers to choose from but hopefully he will get in the final and then it just comes down to who perform the best on the night.”</p>
