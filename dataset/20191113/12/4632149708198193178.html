      <h1>Karnataka: Ahead of by-elections, disqualified Congress, JD(S) MLAs set to join BJP on Thursday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rajashekara S</a></address>
      <p>All disqualified MLAs will join the BJP on Thursday. After the core committee, Arvind Limbavali said a decision on giving tickets to the disqualified MLAs will be taken at the core committee meeting on Thursday. Limbavali said that he would be in charge of the entire by-elections while there will be separate in-charge persons for each of the 15 Assembly polls going for the by-elections. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the disqualification of all 17 Congress and JDS MLAs while allowing them to contest the December 5 by-elections. <br/><br/>The three member bench headed by Justice NV Ramana upheld then Speaker Ramesh Kumar's decision to disqualify 14 Congress and three JDS MLAs. It, however, quashed the term of disqualification stretching the present Assembly tenure. <br/><br/>The court observed that horse-trading was detrimental to democracy. <br/><br/>The court's permission to allow disqualification comes with a rider that they cannot hold any position in the government until they get re-elected. <br/><br/>It also said that the Speaker had no option than to accept the resignation of MLAs. The Speaker, however, can take decision on disqualification even after accepting resignation. The SC also upheld the powers of the Speaker to scrutinise and analyse reasons for resignation of MLAs. <br/>Both the Congress and the BJP have welcomed the decision. <br/><br/>Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa was happy that the disqualified MLAs are allowed to contest while Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said that it is a victory for democracy as the Speaker's decision was upheld by the court. <br/><br/>Disqualified MLAs too expressed happiness at being allowed to recontest the by-elections. <br/><br/><b>Can’t hold govt posts</b> <br/>The court’s permission to allow disqualified MLAs to contest by-elections comes with a condition that they can’t hold any position in the government until they get reelected. The Speaker can take a decision on disqualification even after accepting resignation. The SC also upheld the powers of the Speaker to scrutinise and examine reasons for MLAs’ resignation. All political parties have welcomed the decision. <br/><br/><b>No JD(S) candidate in Hoskote </b><br/>Kumaraswamy said that the party had decided to support Sharath Bachechegowda, son of BJP Lok Sabha member BN Bachche Gowda in Hoskote. <br/><br/>Sharath has decided to contest against BJP’s disqualified MLA MTB Nagaraj. He said that Sharath will decide on joining the party after the elections. <br/><br/>The JD(S) leader said that barring Hoskote, the party will field its candidates in all remaining 14 Assembly Constituencies going for polls. He was critical of Siddaramaiah and accused him of helping the BJP coming to power. “He (Siddaramaiah) is helping BJP to come to power. He called JD(S) BJP’s B-team. This helped the BJP win 105 seats in 2018,” he said. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Congress too is likely to announce its candidates within a couple of days. The party has already chosen candidates for the eight constituencies and the remaining seven are yet to be chosen. <br/><br/><b>KSE bats for son<br/></b><br/>Minister KS Eshwarappa is said to have asked the Ranebennur ticket for his son KE Kantesh if former minister R Shankar decides to contest as an independent candidate at the core committee meeting held on Wednesday, sources said. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, former minister AH Vishwanath is said to be not too keen to contest the by-elections from Hunsuru. He has been asking the BJP to make him an MLC. It is now said that the party might give ticket to former Lok Sabha member CH Vijayashankar. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Deputy CM Laxman Savadi is likely to get a ticket from Athani. Disqualified MLA Mahesh Kumtalli may be accommodated somewhere else, sources said.</p>
