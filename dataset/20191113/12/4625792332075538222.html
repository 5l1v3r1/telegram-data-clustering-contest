      <h1>'I'm not so sure I would be laughing': Lindsey Graham says Hillary Clinton would be tough 2020 opponent</h1>

      <p>Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expects Hillary Clinton would be a tough rival to beat if she decides to enter the 2020 fray.</p>
      <p>Clinton said earlier this week she was “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hillary-clinton-im-under-enormous-pressure-to-run-in-2020">under enormous pressure from many, many, many people</a>,” to consider running for president in 2020.</p>
      <p>"But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans,” she said, but she also added, “As I say, never, never, never say never.”</p>
      <p>President Trump bested Clinton in the 2016 election, though the former Democratic presidential nominee won the popular vote.</p>
      <p>"From a Republican point of view, people laugh, but I'm not so sure I would be laughing, you know, she lost in a close race," Graham <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-shes-enormous-pressure-running-2020/story?id=66955425">told ABC News</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Graham said Clinton, 72, could be a better candidate than the other Democrats running because she is less progressive.</p>
      <p>"I think President Trump feels that he's gonna win because he's done a good job," he said. "But the thing about her candidacy that would be different: She hasn’t promised crazy stuff. She hasn't promised to give illegal immigrants free health care. She hasn’t promised to decriminalize illegal entry into the country. I don't think she supports the Green New Deal or Medicare for All. In that regard, it would be more difficult for the Republicans to have somebody not as wacky."</p>
      <p>The window for Clinton to run may already be closed as she’s missed <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/time-running-short-for-new-2020-democrats-to-jump-in-as-filing-deadlines-approach">the deadline in several states</a> to be on the Democratic primary ballot.</p>
