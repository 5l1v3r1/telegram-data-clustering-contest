      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:03:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>Think back over the last year and take a moment to recall all the food you've really loved.</p>
      <p>Did posh crumpets and seaweed make it to the top of your list?</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/waitrose-ltd">Waitrose &amp; Partners,</a> these were two of the biggest food trends of 2019.</p>
      <p>Yes, really.</p>
      <p>The company have recently released their annual <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/content/dam/waitrose/Inspiration/About%20Us%20New/Food%20and%20drink%20report%202017/foodanddrinkreport1920v2.pdf?source=aff_awin&amp;utm_source=Skimlinks&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrose.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fwaitrose%2FInspiration%2FAbout%2520Us%2520New%2FFood%2520and%2520drink%2520report%25202017%2Ffoodanddrinkreport1920v2.pdf&amp;source=aff_awin&amp;awc=3691_1573643321_eb91e4b2c73e1bbad958664ab88f5144">food and drink report</a> which uses consumer research, sales data and search insights from waitrose.com to work out which items have proved most popular this year.</p>
      <p>And if that weren't enough, they also shared a look at the foods that we have to look forward to in 2020.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>One of the biggest trends of 2019 has apparently been tahini, a paste made from toasted and ground sesame seeds that is commonly used as an ingredient in houmous.</p>
      <p>The report claims that searches for tahini paste on the Waitrose website are up a whopping 700 percent on last year.</p>
      <p>As well as this, different types of noodles have also been having a moment, with searches for soba noodles up 83 percent and udon noodles soaring by 50 percent.</p>
      <p>Crumpet sales also rose by 27 percent over the year, with the supermarket suggesting chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi and Marcus Wareing are to blame for introducing us all to 'posh crumpets'.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Gone are the days when lashings of jam and butter would suffice on a crumpet, now people are swapping these out for Marmite and cheese or even more luxurious toppings such as lobster or cockle butter.</p>
      <p>Joining these in the top trends are celery juice, vegan ready-meals, grains such as quinoa and bulgar wheat, luxury frozen food (think king prawn, mussel and clam tagliatelle), food on skewers and seaweed, kelp and algae which are all foods eaten by those on a 'seaganism' diet.</p>
      <p>Away from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/food">food,</a> the company says eco-friendly cleaning products have also become more popular this year, with eco laundry sales rising by 40 percent and eco dishwashing products by 26 percent - even recycled toilet paper has been selling 39 percent more than in 2018.</p>
      <p>So what trends are here to stay and which are up and coming for 2020?</p>
      <p>The report reveals that Middle Eastern home cooking is set to become more popular over the coming months.</p>
      <p>It says: "Many of us have been buying houmous or falafels for some time - and the kebab house holds a place in many Brits' hearts.</p>
      <p>"But now we're dabbling with the complex flavours of Middle Eastern cuisine at home as well."</p>
      <p>They also predict 'seacuterie' will take off in 2020, which is exactly what it sounds, a "reimagining of charcuterie, using seafood instead of meat".</p>
      <p>The trend is believed to have originated in Australia.</p>
      <p>And when it comes to drinks, Waitrose says everyone is thinking pink, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alcohol">alcohol</a> aisles "exploding" with pink gins and and rosé wine - a trend that looks set to continue with blush-coloured drinks all round.</p>
      <p>Other emerging drinks trends include English orange wine and alcohol-free Negroni.</p>
