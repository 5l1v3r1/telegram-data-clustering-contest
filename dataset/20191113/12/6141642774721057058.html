      <p>Qantas is set to try a new ultra-long haul flight from London to Sydney as part of a trial for a potential commercial route.</p>
      <p>The test flight, as part of Qantas’s Project Sunrise, will see a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner carry just 40 people – including crew – to the other side of the world in approximately 19 hours.</p>
      <p>The flight was scheduled to leave London at 6am on Thursday, local time, and arrive into Sydney around lunch time on Friday, a Qantas spokesman said.</p>
      <p>A Dreamliner can usually carry between 230 and 300 people depending on its interior set-up.</p>
      <p>Currently it is impossible to fly a plane at full capacity of both passengers and cargo from cities on the east coast of Australia to London without stopping to refuel.</p>
      <p>It is possible to fly non-stop from London to the city of Perth in Western Australia as it is 1,600 miles closer.</p>
      <p>Despite vowing to slash carbon emissions and reach net zero by 2050, the Australian airline is testing the viability of the London to Sydney route as a regular commercial flight.</p>
      <p>The airline said all carbon emissions from Thursday’s take-off will be fully offset.</p>

      <p>Those on board will be mostly Qantas employees and will be fitted with monitors to track their sleep patterns, food and drink intake, lighting, physical movement and in-flight entertainment.</p>
      <p>The data will be assessed by researchers from the Charles Perkins Centre – a medical institute at the University of Sydney – to assess the impact of the flight on their health, wellbeing and body clock.</p>
      <p>A team from Melbourne’s Monash University will work with pilots and crew to monitor melatonin levels before, during and after the flight. Melatonin is the hormone that regulates sleep cycles.</p>
      <p>Pilots will wear a device that tracks brain wave patterns and monitors alertness, Qantas said, to gather data on the best work and rest patterns for long-haul services.</p>

      <p>The airline said the data on crew wellbeing and alertness will be shared with the Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority to inform future regulations for ultra-long haul flights.</p>
      <p>Qantas will also gather general feedback from passengers on food choices, stretching and wellbeing zones and in-flight entertainment.</p>
      <p>The airline’s chief executive Alan Joyce said previously: “Ultra-long haul flying presents a lot of common sense questions about the comfort and wellbeing of passengers and crew.</p>
      <p>“These flights are going to provide invaluable data to help answer them.”</p>
      <p>It will be the second aircraft to fly the route non-stop – the first touched down in August 1989.</p>
      <p>Qantas did fly a Dreamliner non-stop from New York to Sydney last month as part of Project Sunrise, although the route is around 1,000 miles shorter.</p>
      <p>It is due to make a final decision on the viability of Project Sunrise as a commercial flight route by the end of the year.</p>
