      <h1>General Election 2019: Celebrities voting Labour, Tory, Lib Dems and Green</h1>
      <h2>The surprising and not-so surprising ways celebrities will be casting their ballots this December</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:22:31+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Needham, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>On December 12 the UK will be heading to the polls to vote for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">next Prime Minister.</a></p>
      <p>As in previous years, a host of celebrities have been weighing in on who to vote for in the upcoming election.</p>
      <p>From galvanising social media followers, to dropping hints in interviews and even showing up at rallies, celebrity endorsements are on the rise as election fever builds.</p>
      <p>With less than a month to go now before the big day, we take a look over who is backing who.</p>
      <h3>Stormzy</h3>

      <p>In the run up to the last election in 2017, the Grime star threw his support behind Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. While the rapper is yet to confirm if he'll back the party again, it's pretty safe to say he won't be voting Tory.</p>
      <p>Last month Stormzy fired off a series of furious tweets in response to the comments made by Jacob Rees-Mog over the Grenfell tragey.</p>
      <p>He called the politician 'an actual piece of s*** after the Tory MP blamed Grenfell victims for their deaths and said they lacked 'common sense.'</p>
      <p>"I can’t believe the cheek f****** hell these politicians are actual aliens,” Stormzy fired.</p>
      <p>"This man is the scummiest. You can’t even make this stuff up... let’s bare in mind for 2 secs how horrifying and terrifying the situation would have been for the victims.</p>
      <p>"Bare of you politicians are evil and wicked and that’s why we hate you."</p>
      <h3>Lily Allen</h3>

      <p>The Smile hitmaker has been another supporter of Labour party in the past.</p>
      <p>While she's yet to pledge any allegiance so far, Lily has been a vocal critic of the current Conservative government - recently vowing to leaving the country until after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> was over.</p>
      <p>But after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> extended the deadline until 31st January 2020, Lily returned to the UK at the start of November.</p>
      <p>The London based star previously told her social media followers: "Leaving UK till after Brexit. Good Luck Kids."</p>
      <h3>Kathy Burke</h3>

      <p>Ahead of the election announcement, lifelong labour voter Kathy spoke of her unease with the current political climate.</p>
      <p>Asked about who she'd theoretically vote for in interview with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/kathy-burke-theresa-may-prime-minister-labour-conservatives-green-a9044821.html">the Independent</a>, Kathy said: "I’d probably go Green because I am really worried about climate change and the planet. I’ve been a Labour voter all my life… But I don’t know how I feel about things at the moment, quite honestly."</p>
      <p>On the state of the economy and gentrification, Kathy added: "The whole thing is a terrible mess. I really feel for young people, I don’t know what they’re going to do. Especially living in London, they can’t afford a place to live and they won’t be able to afford to eat soon. Look at Hoxton [in east London]. Hoxton was a s***hole, and now it costs a fortune to live in someone’s bin shed."</p>
      <h3>Liam Gallagher</h3>

      <p>The outspoken Oasis rocker weighed in on his political leanings during his recent column for the Mirror.</p>
      <p>Liam who previously said he “loves Europe”, described Brexit as like being on “a bad trip” and dubbed politicians “f**king d**kheads”</p>
      <p>"It’s just going round. You turn on the TV and it’s some geezer going ‘I don’t know what’s going on’.</p>
      <p>"Come on, you f***king d**kheads. You all went to Eton, you went to all these fish schools. Come on you idiots.”</p>
      <p>Liam explained that he would definitely not vote Conservative and would most likely back the Green Party because they 'make sense'.</p>
      <p>"Labour I can’t do, I’m not sure about them. It would be the Green Party – that is the only party that makes sense.</p>
      <p>"We know for a fact that the world is in a bad place; we know that we need to do more, but the other clowns are going, ‘we are going to do this’ and ‘we are going to do that’ and then they get into power and do f*** all.”</p>
      <p>He previously said to NME he takes politics with a “pinch of salt, because you don’t know who to trust”.</p>
      <h3>Eddie Izzard</h3>

      <p>Eddie has been a Labour Party activist for most of his adult life.</p>
      <p>This year will be no different. The comedian was spotted campaigning in Blackpool and Cleveleys earlier this month where he delivered a speech for candidate Chris Webb.</p>
      <h3>Katie Hopkins</h3>

      <p>It's safe to say the controversial ex Apprentice contestant is no fan of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>Hopkins' social media has been awash with support for the Tories over the last few weeks with her urging her followers to #backBoris on December 12.</p>
