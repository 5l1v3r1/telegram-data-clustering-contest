      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/labour-rule-out-any-deal-20826795">Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out holding a referendum</a> on Scottish independence in the first term of a Labour government, even if the SNP gets a majority in Scotland.</p>
      <p>In an interview as he kicked off his two-day tour of Scotland in Glasgow, Mr Corbyn said: "No referendum in the first term for a Labour government because I think we need to concentrate completely in investment across Scotland."</p>

      <p>But pressed if it would be an undemocratic move <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-lends-support-independence-20867436">if the SNP won a majority of seats in Scotland in the General Election</a> , he said: "If the SNP win the majority of seats that's the election of those MPs. I'm very clear that a Labour government's priority is investment in Scotland."</p>
      <p>Aides later backtracked and made it clear that Labour's position could change if the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/snp-accuse-boris-johnson-shafting-20851094">SNP</a> won a majority in Holyrood in 2021.</p>
