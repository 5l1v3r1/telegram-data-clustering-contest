      <h1>Rolls-Royce Says Current-Gen Ghost Production Is Coming To An End</h1>
      <h2>We’ve already spotted the next-gen model.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:22:28+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-alaniz/" target="_blank">Anthony Alaniz</a></address>
      <p>The demise of the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/rolls-royce/ghost/">Rolls-Royce Ghost</a> is no surprise. Not only have our eagled-eye spy photographers captured <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379465/rolls-royce-ghost-spy-shots/">disguised versions of the next-gen Ghost</a>, but the Ghost has also been around for a decade. It first debuted at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. A long-wheelbase version followed in 2011 with an updated Ghost Series II debuting in Geneva in 2014. So, it's time for a new model; however, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/rolls-royce/">Rolls-Royce</a> isn't letting the current Ghost disappear quietly into the night.</p>
      <p>To commemorate the Ghost's last decade, Rolls is introducing the Ghost Black Badge edition, which was on display this past weekend at the 2019 NEC Classic Motor Show. Rolls-Royce finished the exterior in Dark Emerald and Black diamond with a Seashell and black interior. Even the iconic Spirit of Ecstasy got redone in dark chrome.</p>

      <p>Like other Black Badge edition models, the Ghost will deliver more power and torque than the standard Ghost, though Rolls didn't cite specific numbers. The same twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V12 resides under the hood. The Ghost Black Badge will also feature a tuned drivetrain and chassis. It's a fitting goodbye for the iconic luxury car.</p>
      <p>When the new, next-generation Ghost arrives, it'll ride on the same platform as the new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/rolls-royce/phantom/">Phantom</a> and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/rolls-royce/cullinan/">Cullinan</a> – Rolls' Architecture of Luxury. However, while it' will receive a new platform, the stylistic differences compared to the current model may be challenging to spot. The Ghost test mules we've spotted appear to retain the current model's exterior appearance, especially at the front. However, the roofline is sleeker along with the headlights that flank the brand's large, flat grille.</p>

      <p>The same 6.-75-liter engine should power the new Ghost, too. There are rumors of an electric version, though it's unlikely to arrive at the launch of the new generation. The current Ghost is a benchmark in bespoke luxury, but the platform is old. Technology has changed a lot in the last decade, and the next-generation will give Rolls the perfect platform for introducing new safety features and driver-assistive technologies.</p>

        <h4>ROLLS-ROYCE GHOST APPEARS AS NEW MODERN CLASSIC AT NEC MOTOR SHOW</h4>
        <p>
          <i>Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge will be the star attraction at the 2019 NEC Classic Motor Show. This highly Bespoke motor car will be on display on the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts’ Club (RREC) stand at the event – the biggest of its kind in the world – which brings together owners, collectors, enthusiasts and car club members to share their passion for classic cars.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Ghost has been selected because 2019 marks the end of the model family’s remarkable ten year tenure in which it has secured uninterrupted commercial and critical success. Since its launch at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2009, Ghost has established itself as a modern classic: the most popular Rolls-Royce model of the Goodwood era to date, it introduced the Rolls-Royce brand to a new audience of younger, often self‑made customers. A long-wheelbase version was introduced in 2011 and an updated Ghost Series II was unveiled in Geneva in 2014.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Black Badge offers a darker, edgier expression of the Rolls‑Royce family to a new generation of customers. Young, driven and assertive, these bold, confident men and women demand the highest levels of power, performance and presence, as well as unparalleled luxury. Black Badge has transformed perceptions of the Rolls-Royce brand and created a uniquely powerful and distinctive presence within the super-luxury sector.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>The exterior of the Ghost on display at the NEC is finished in Dark Emerald and Black Diamond, with a Seashell and Black interior and Technical Fibre veneer. The iconic Spirit of Ecstasy mascot is rendered in Dark Chrome. Like all members of the Black Badge family, Ghost Black Badge delivers more power and torque than the standard model, with a drivetrain and chassis specially tuned for even more responsive handling and an immersive, exhilarating driving experience. The car will be hosted by experts from the Home of Rolls‑Royce in Goodwood, West Sussex.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Ghost Black Badge will be one of more than 3,000 iconic classic and vintage cars and motorbikes on display across seven halls at Birmingham’s NEC. The RREC is among more than 300 car and motorcycle clubs attending the event from around the world.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Alongside Ghost Black Badge, the RREC stand will feature other magnificent examples from the marque’s more distant past, including a Rolls‑Royce 20hp, a 1919 Rolls‑Royce Silver Ghost and a Rolls‑Royce Silver Spirit II.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>The Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts’ Club caters for anyone with an interest in the motor car products of Rolls‑Royce. From just 11 people at the inaugural meeting in 1957, membership now stands at around 10,000. Membership is open to owners and non-owners alike and members are drawn from all walks of life and from countries across the world.  For more details visit: www.rrec.org.uk.</i>
