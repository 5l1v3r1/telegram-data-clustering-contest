      <h1>Rangers have a massive transfer disadvantage and every other team knows it - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Michael Gannon answers your calls as debate rages over the big issues in Scottish football.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:50:12+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Clarke has suffered more knock-backs than our Chess Club’s night out in the Savoy in 1995 but the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> manager can at least rely on some moral support from the Tartan Army.</p>
      <p>There’s been a rake of dissies for the national team with most of our star turns bailing out with a range of twists and niggles, with others deciding to give the set up the elbow altogether.</p>
      <p>Clarke is up against it but the punters reckons it’s the players who should be copping the flak as turning up for national service doesn’t seem to have the appeal of old.</p>
      <p><b>Tam Bain, Guisborough,</b> said: “I can’t believe all these call-offs. I thought it was an honour to wear the Dark Blue but there’s no passion or desire with these players.</p>

      <p>“The likes of Denis Law would have turned up with a broken leg but the way it is now is a joke.”</p>
      <p>While Bob Shearer emailed: “The SFA should incorporate the FIFA rule allowing national teams to ban injured players from playing for their clubs for five days after an international.</p>
      <p>“This should be automatic and applied to every player and not left to the manager and possibly affecting their working relationship with the player.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The debate from last weekend’s Remembrance Sunday incidents at Celtic Park continues to rumble on.</p>
      <p>Paul Price, East Belfast, said: “I was at the Celtic games when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fernando-ricksen">Fernando Ricksen</a> got a minute’s applause and the one at the weekend for the minute’s silent for Remembrance Sunday and both were impeccably observed. I saw lots of fans wearing poppies and nothing was said, while there was also respect for the people who chose not to wear one, for their own reasons.</p>
      <p>“I was proud of the vast majority of the support.”</p>

      <p><b>Ian Munro, Edinburgh,</b> said: “So Ian McCaulay thinks the poppy should be kept out of football and certain teams have hijacked it. I hope he’s not referring to Hearts whose entire first team joined up and six players made the ultimate sacrifice. A remembrance service has been held every year since.”</p>
      <p><b>Alfie Mullan, London,</b> said: “The Hotline claims that the poppy should be kept out of football. Why? At every other industry in the UK, people can choose to wear the poppy or not, without any trouble. It’s only the Neanderthals at a certain club in Scotland who seem to have a problem with it.”</p>
      <p>But <b>Brian McColligan</b> , via email, said: “In answer to Mark Watson, our forefathers fought for democracy and free will. It is not being disrespectful not to wear a poppy. It’s each persons democratic right and free will to make that choice. We all remember the last country that forced people to wear emblems on their clothing – Nazi Germany.”</p>

      <p>Still on Sunday’s game, how’s this for a conspiracy?</p>
      <p><b>Richard Hodelet, Dargavel Village</b> , said: “A word in the ear of Richard Tait, if you are going to score an own goal for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> try and make it look more of an accident. Any striker would have been proud of that shot. Mandatory disclaimer: I support neither of the Old Firm.”</p>
      <p>And <b>Alan Clarke</b> emailed: “Steven Gerrard is spot in with his comments about protection for his players from referees.</p>
      <p>“Every other team in the SPFL has it’s fair share of talentless cloggers who regularly go unpunished by most refs and Scott Brown gets away with murder in every Old Firm game.”</p>
      <p>No one is safe from a dig in Scottish football and even national treasure and Hotline regular Rod Stewart copped it.</p>

      <p><b>Frank McFerran, Carrickfergus</b> , said: “I keep reading about this super Celt Rod Stewart. How many shares does this multimillionaire have in the club?”</p>
      <p>There’s no reason to believe he doesn’t mind you, but anyway, let’s move on.</p>
      <p>There might be frost on the glass but the transfer window opens soon.</p>
      <p><b>Gordon Ashley, Ayr</b> , said: “<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> can kid themselves on Alfredo Morelos is worth £25m and Glen Kamara £8m. Their financial woes will force them to accept their true values of £8m and £2m as chairmen of other clubs know know their latest financial results."</p>
