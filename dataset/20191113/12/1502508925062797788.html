      <p>The rate of retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) breached the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) medium-term target of 4 per cent in October, for the first time in 15 months, on the back of higher food prices.</p>
      <p>The CPI-inflation rate had stood at 3.99 per cent in September and 3.38 per cent in October 2018.</p>

      <p>Inflation in the food basket spiked to 7.89 per cent in October 2019, against 5.11 per cent the previous month. The RBI mainly factors in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cpi">CPI </a>based inflation to arrive at its bi-monthly monetary policy. The RBI has been asked to keep the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/retail-inflation">retail inflation </a>at around 4 per cent.</p>
      <p>Most economists, however, expect the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to look past the inflation data and cut rates for a sixth straight time next month, with economic growth and industrial output sagging to six-year lows.<br/><br/>Annual <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/retail-inflation">retail inflation </a>rose to 4.62 per cent last month, up from 3.99 per cent the previous month and higher than the 4.25 per cent forecast in a <i>Reuters</i> poll of analysts.<br/><br/>Prices of most vegetables climbed in October as monsoon downpours delayed harvests and disrupted supplies.<br/><br/>That was despite a government ban on onion exports, a key component in the Indian diet.<br/><br/>"The inflation print has surprised on the upside on account of vegetable inflation in October," said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Edelweiss Securities.<br/><br/>Worries on the economic slowdown have already prompted the RBI to cut interest rates by a total of 135 basis points this year.<br/><br/>Economists say the RBI will continue to cut rates as July-September growth could be worse than the previous quarter after industrial output contracted two out of three months during the period and core inflation continues to reflect weak demand.<br/><br/>September industrial output contracted 4.3 per cent, government data showed on Monday following a decline of 1.4 per cent in August.<br/><br/>The RBI too has lowered its economic growth forecast by 80 basis points to 6.1% for the current year ending March 2020.<br/><br/>Three analysts said October core inflation was at 3.44-3.60 per cent, against 4-4.02 per cent in September.</p>
