      <p>Blizzard has updated Overwatch with a new challenge for players to tackle and that is Mercy’s Recall challenge in which players can get a new player icon, new sprays and a Dr Ziegler skin. There are two ways to earning rewards and they include either playing Overwatch or watching streamers on Twitch play Overwatch.</p>

      <p>The reward distribution for both playing and watching is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Win 3 Games | 1 Player Icon</li>
        <li>Win 6 Games | 2 New Sprays</li>
        <li>Win 9 Games | New legendary skin: Dr. Ziegler skin</li>
        <li>Watch 2 Hours | 1 New Spray</li>
        <li>Watch 4 Hours | 2 New Sprays</li>
        <li>Watch 6 Hours | 3 New Sprays</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Mercy Recall challenge is live until December 2nd. A couple of weeks ago Overwatch 2 was announced at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/overwatch-2-reveal-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc/">BlizzCon </a>with confirmation that this <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/overwatch-2-backward-compatible-pvp-gameplay-trailer-cosmetics-maps/">sequel</a> would feature story missions and PvE events. In terms of multiplayer, the PvP will be compatible with the first Overwatch title. All of the maps and heroes that are added to Overwatch 2 will also be accessible to those who have Overwatch, so the sequel’s real new additions are the story content.</p>
      <p>To sum it up Jeff from the Overwatch team said:</p>
      <blockquote>The other thing that I think a lot of us are thinking about is all of those cool accomplishments and cosmetics that we’ve been unlocked over the years. You know, how hard did you work for your Witch Mercy skin, for example? We want to make sure that all Overwatch cosmetics come forward with you to Overwatch 2, so all your progress matters. Nothing’s getting left behind, no one’s getting left behind.</blockquote>
      <p>A release date for Overwatch 2 is to be confirmed.</p>
