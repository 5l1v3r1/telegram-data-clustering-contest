      <h1>Naughty Dog Lead has "Big Ambitions" for Online Play</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T12:38:52+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>It looks like Naughty Dog is hiring up for a new multiplayer experience. In a tweet yesterday, lead game designer Vinit Agarwal linked to a <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/greenhouse/job/1899140?gh_jid=1899140&amp;gh_src=6c7fc5481">new job posting</a> for an online systems programmer, telling followers that the studios has "big ambitions" for its future projects.</p>
      <p>The job advert itself suggests that the new hire would be responsible for "taking the meticulously crafted themes Naughty Dog's games are known for and integrating a social and competitive experience" into them. There's no word on what those games might be though, which has fans speculating about the studio's future projects. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/09/27/the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-not-include-a-multiplayer-mode">Naughty Dog confirmed that multiplayer would not feature in <i>The Last of Us Part II</i></a>, but the Naughty Dog Jobs Twitter account says that's the only game it's currently hiring for, which could mean that some kind of standalone multiplayer mode is in the works. Add to that the suggestion that "you will eventually experience the fruits of our team's online ambition," and something Joel-and-Ellie-related seems increasingly likely.</p>
      <p>Of course, it's also possible that the team is quietly working on one of its other IPs. It's likely to be a long time before we see anything new from the Uncharted series, but Nathan Drake and co have had plenty to offer in terms of multiplayer over the past few years. Either way, we're unlikely to find out more until after the release of The Last of Us Part II, so perhaps it'll be worth keeping an eye out for more news next summer.</p>
