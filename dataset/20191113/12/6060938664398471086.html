      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Retail-inflation">Retail inflation</a> based on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/consumer-price-index">consumer price index</a> (CPI) rose to 4.62 per cent in October as against 3.99 per cent in September + , government data showed on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The figure exceeded the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) medium-term target of 4 per cent for the first time in 15 months, mainly because of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/rising-vegetable-prices">rising vegetable prices</a>, reducing the headroom for a rate cut by the RBI in its monetary policy due next month.</p>
      <p>The RBI mainly factors in the retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy.</p>
      <p>The RBI has cut its key interest rate by a cumulative 135 basis points (bps) this year to 5.15 per cent. The central bank is expected to cut the repo rate in December for the sixth meeting in a row, according to a separate Reuters poll. That view primarily stems from a slowing economy.</p>
      <p>The inflation in the food basket spiked to 7.89 per cent in October 2019 as against 5.11 per cent the preceding month, showed the data released by the Central Statistics Office under the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A poll conducted by news agency Reuters had predicted that retail prices rose to 4.25 per cent in October, its highest since June 2018.</p>
      <p>Prices of most vegetables climbed during the month as monsoon downpours delayed harvests and disrupted supplies. That was despite a government ban on onion exports, a key component in the Indian diet.</p>
      <p>During the month, inflation in vegetables spiked to 26.10 per cent from 5.40 per cent in September, while for fruits it jumped to 4.08 per cent from 0.83 per cent.</p>
      <p>Aditi Nayar, economist at Icra told news agency PTI that looking ahead the pace of normalisation in vegetable prices will be the key driver of the trend in food inflation over the next few months.</p>
      <p>"Overall, the CPI inflation may continue to print higher than 4 per cent in the remainder of FY2020, complicating policy choices in light of the slowdown in economic growth momentum.</p>
      <p>"The sharp uptick in the CPI inflation in October 2019 has contrasted with the industrial contraction recorded in September 2019. In our view, the extent to which the Q2 FY2020 GDP growth reading eases further from the 5 per cent recorded in the previous quarter, will influence the MPC's decision on whether to cut rates further, and by how much, in the December 2019 policy review," she said.</p>
      <p>Despite easy monetary and fiscal policy, recent business surveys indicate the economy, which slowed to a six-year low of 5 per cent growth during the second quarter, is still struggling and is not expected to recover anytime soon.</p>
