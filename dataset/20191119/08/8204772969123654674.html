      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=EasyJet">EasyJet</a> said it will trim expansion next year in an effort to bolster fares and months ended September 30th, Europe’s second-biggest discount airline said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The capacity increase in fiscal 2020 will be at the lower end of an historic 3 per cent to 8 per cent range, down from 10 per cent in the 12 months ended September 30th, Europe’s second-biggest discount airline said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Johan+Lundgren">Johan Lundgren</a> said in a statement forward book for the first half of fiscal 2020 are “reassuring” and slightly ahead of last year.</p>
      <p>The company reported a 2019 pretax profit of £427 million, down from £578 million a year earlier. It said last month the figure would be in a £420 million and £430 million range.</p>
      <p>Passenger numbers increased by 8.6 per cent to 96.1 million. EasyJet hasn’t given up on growth and recently bought a batch of operating slots at London Gatwick Airport in a deal worth more than £30 million.</p>
      <p>Mr Lundgren said that from today EasyJet will become the first carrier in the world to make all flights net zero carbon by offsetting emissions across its network. – Bloomberg</p>
