      <h1>Has anyone got to their second double-century faster than Mayank Agarwal?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:00:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Steven Lynch</a></address>
      <p><b>Bangladesh's openers both made 6 in each innings of the Indore Test. Is this unique?</b> <i>asked Sandeep Sachdeva from India</i><br/>The short answer is yes: four identical scores by a team's openers, as Shadman Islam and Imrul Kayes managed against India <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/scorecard/1187016/india-vs-bangladesh-1st-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021">in Indore</a> last week, does appear to be unique in Tests.</p>
      <p>I was quite surprised to find that there has never yet been an instance of both openers from one side bagging a pair in the same Test. Indeed, there has only been one instance of this by openers on opposing sides - by Graeme Wood for Australia and Bruce Edgar for New Zealand <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17044/scorecard/63277/australia-vs-new-zealand-2nd-test-new-zealand-tour-of-australia-1980-81">in Perth</a> in 1980-81.</p>
      <p>The highest identical score in both innings of a match by an opener is a brace of 58s, by New Zealand's John Morrison against England <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17198/scorecard/63144/new-zealand-vs-england-1st-test-england-tour-of-new-zealand-1974-75">in Auckland</a> in 1974-75.</p>
      <p><b>What's the record for the most successive Tests in which a side has had a batsman score a double-century?</b> <i>asked Abhijeet Das from India</i><br/>As you may have guessed, the record was established by India in the recent match against Bangladesh <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/scorecard/1187016/india-vs-bangladesh-1st-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021">in Indore</a>. That was the fourth successive Test in which one of their batsmen had reached 200: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/398438.html">Mayank Agarwal</a>'s 243 followed the series against South Africa, in which Rohit Sharma made 212 <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/scorecard/1187009/india-vs-south-africa-3rd-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021">in Ranchi</a>, Virat Kohli an unbeaten 254 <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/scorecard/1187008/india-vs-south-africa-2nd-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021">in Pune</a>, and Agarwal himself 215 <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19430/scorecard/1187007/india-vs-south-africa-1st-test-icc-world-test-championship-2019-2021">in Visakhapatnam</a>.</p>
      <p>India also had three double-centuries in successive Tests in 2016-17: Kohli hit 235 <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10732/scorecard/1034815/india-vs-england-4th-test-england-tour-of-india-2016-17">in Mumbai</a> and Karun Nair 303 not out <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10732/scorecard/1034817/india-vs-england-5th-test-england-tour-of-india-2016-17">in Chennai</a> against England, and Kohli added 204 in the next Test, against Bangladesh <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10768/scorecard/1041761/india-vs-bangladesh-only-test-bangladesh-tour-of-india-2016-17">in Hyderabad</a>. This equalled Sri Lanka's run in 2004, when in successive Tests against South Africa in August, Mahela Jayawardene made 237 <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/14990/scorecard/64097/sri-lanka-vs-south-africa-1st-test-south-africa-tour-of-sri-lanka-2004">in Galle</a> and Kumar Sangakkara 232 <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/14990/scorecard/64098/sri-lanka-vs-south-africa-2nd-test-south-africa-tour-of-sri-lanka-2004">in Colombo</a>; then Sanath Jayasuriya hit 253 against Pakistan <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/14949/scorecard/64105/pakistan-vs-sri-lanka-1st-test-sri-lanka-tour-of-pakistan-2004-05">in Faisalabad</a> in October.</p>
      <p><b>Has anyone ever been out for 99 on his Test debut?</b> <i>asked Brian Farmer from England</i><br/>This maddening fate has befallen three batsmen. The first was Australia's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/4570.html">Arthur Chipperfield</a>, against England <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17565/scorecard/62619/england-vs-australia-1st-test-australia-tour-of-england-1934">at Trent Bridge</a> in 1934. He went to lunch on the second day with 99, but was out to the third ball after the interval.</p>
      <p>Next to fall for a debut 99 was the bespectacled West Indian <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/51473.html">Robert Christiani</a>, against England <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17505/scorecard/62681/west-indies-vs-england-1st-test-england-tour-of-west-indies-1947-48">in Bridgetown</a> in 1947-48: it's said he burst into tears in the dressing room afterwards. And <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/player/39041.html">Asim Kamal</a> marked his first Test for Pakistan with 99 against South Africa <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/15139/scorecard/64050/pakistan-vs-south-africa-1st-test-south-africa-tour-of-pakistan-2003-04">in Lahore</a> in 2003-04. Chipperfield and Christiani did later reach three figures in Tests - but the unfortunate Kamal never did.</p>
      <p>In all, <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;debut_or_last=1;filter=advanced;orderby=batted_score;runsmax1=99;runsmin1=90;runsval1=runs;size=200;template=results;type=batting;view=innings">31 batsmen</a> have been out in the nineties on their Test debut.</p>

      <p><b>Mayank Agarwal scored his second double-century in his 12th Test innings. Has anyone got two faster than this - apart presumably from Don Bradman?</b> <i>asked Tony Le Roux from Australia</i><br/>Actually this is one scoring table in which <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/4188.html">Don Bradman</a> wasn't on top - his second double-century (334 against England <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17588/scorecard/62582/england-vs-australia-3rd-test-australia-tour-of-england-1930">at Headingley</a> in 1930) came in his 13th Test innings, so Mayank Agarwal beats the Don by one. But another Indian remains ahead: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/30009.html">Vinod Kambli</a>, who had not long turned 21, scored 224 in his fourth Test innings, against England <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16457/scorecard/63600/india-vs-england-3rd-test-england-tour-of-india-1992-93">in Mumbai</a> in 1992-93, and 227 in his next one, against Zimbabwe <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16436/scorecard/63604/india-vs-zimbabwe-only-test-zimbabwe-tour-of-india-1992-93">in Delhi</a> a few weeks later. Kambli made two more centuries later in the year against Sri Lanka. After seven matches (and eight innings), he had 793 runs at an average of 113.28 - but never managed another Test ton, and his career fizzled out after only ten more matches, although that electric start ensured he finished with an average of 54.20.</p>
      <p><b>Were Deepak Chahar's 6 for 7 the best bowling figures in any T20 match?</b> <i>asked Phil Rafferty from the Czech Republic</i><br/><a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/447261.html">Deepak Chahar</a>'s remarkable figures of 6 for 7 against Bangladesh <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19312/scorecard/1187015/india-vs-bangladesh-3rd-t20i-bangladesh-in-india-2019-20">in Nagpur</a> recently were the best in T20Is, just beating Ajantha Mendis' 6 for 8 for Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8604/scorecard/533272/sri-lanka-vs-zimbabwe-1st-match-group-c-icc-world-twenty20-2012-13">in Hambantota</a> in September 2012. Mendis also took 6 for 16 against Australia <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/12795/scorecard/516205/sri-lanka-vs-australia-2nd-t20i-australia-tour-of-sri-lanka-2011">in Pallekele</a> in August 2011; the only other man to take six in a T20I is the Indian legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal, with 6 for 25 against England <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10732/scorecard/1034829/india-vs-england-3rd-t20i-england-tour-of-india-2016-17">in Bengaluru</a> in February 2017.</p>
      <p>There have been <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/305212.html">three better returns</a> in all senior T20 cricket (as well as two other 6 for 7s). A new record was established during England's Vitality Blast in August 2019, when Leicestershire's Colin Ackermann took 7 for 18 against the Birmingham Bears <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8053/scorecard/1167188/leicestershire-vs-birmingham-bears-north-group-vitality-blast-2019">at Grace Road</a>.</p>
      <p>Chahar's spell the other day also included the <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283738.html">12th hat-trick in T20Is</a>, but the first for India.</p>
