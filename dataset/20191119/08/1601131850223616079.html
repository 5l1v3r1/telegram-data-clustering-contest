      <p>More and more Galaxy smartphones are being updated with the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-monthly-updates-november-2019-security-patch-detailed/">November 2019 security patch</a> as we move towards the end of the month. Samsung has recently released an update for the Galaxy A8 (2018), Galaxy A8+ (2018), Galaxy J6+, Galaxy J8, Galaxy A30, and Galaxy A20e with the latest security fixes onboard. The updates are rolling out in different markets for each device and may not be made available in every market a device is sold in, which is standard fare for security updates.</p>
      <p>Also, all the devices mentioned above are only getting the latest security fixes with their respective updates. No new features are included, not even for newer phones like the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A10e. However, security updates are an important part of owning an Android device, so you should grab the latest update as soon as you can. You can check if it’s available on your phone by opening the Settings app, navigating to <i>Software update, </i>and tapping <i>Download and install</i>. Alternatively, you can visit our <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares">firmware section</a> and enter your device model to see whether it has received a new update.</p>
