      <p>After almost a full year of teasing, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/the-game">The Game</a> has finally unveiled more information regarding his supposed final album, <i>Born II Rap</i>. The Compton-born artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5BuEH9p8f0/?utm_source=ig_embed">took to Instagram</a> to share the cover art of his ninth studio album, along with the star-studded tracklist and release date.</p>
      <p><i>Born II Rap’s</i> album art sees The Game working inside a studio, surrounded by nine pregnant women either smoking, drinking or working as a sound engineer. ”The concept behind this photo goes way beyond what you see upon 1st glance &amp; I absolutely cannot wait for all of you to hear the music that goes along with the album,” he wrote as part of a lengthy Instagram caption. “I’ve had a great run &amp; surpassed my rap goals along time ago…. it’s by God’s grace that I’m able to still be here to deliver full projects at this caliber in an industry where I’ve seen artists come &amp; go. It will always be “QUALITY” over “QUANTITY” from where I stand. The REAL music will always prevail &amp; this album will cap off an amazing run. I’m grateful for all the producers &amp; artists who’ve helped this album become what it is &amp; I am more excited for my fans than I am for myself.”</p>
      <p>The lengthy project will include 24 tracks — 24 in honor of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nba">NBA</a> legend <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kobe-bryant">Kobe Bryant</a> — is stacked with guest features, including <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> (for two songs), <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/anderson-paak">Anderson .Paak</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/21-savage">21 Savage</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/chris-brown">Chris Brown</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/trey-songz">Trey Songz</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/masego">Masego</a> and a posthumous appearance from <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nipsey-hussle">Nipsey Hussle</a>. “I took the liberty in attaching the track listing as I know you guys have been wondering who’s on it….,” he explained. “24 tracks because @kobebryant is my all time favorite player &amp; has been a friend &amp; inspiration to my career, so I saw it just to pay homage to the [GOAT].”</p>
