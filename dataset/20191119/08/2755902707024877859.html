      <p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa has finally explained why he never takes off his trademark multicoloured scarf regardless of day or season. The President’s reveal comes after almost two years of speculation and conspiracy theories. Some had even gone as far as suggesting that <a href="https://iharare.com/blood-rituals-responsible-for-horrific-accidents/">Mnangagwa’s scarf is linked to the occultic and juju</a>.</p>
      <p>However, speaking at the official opening of the 5th Global Business Forum on Africa in Dubai, Mnangagwa decided to explain the reason he never takes off his scarf.</p>
      <p>According to the state-owned <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/ed-explains-scarf-tradition/">Herald</a> newspaper, the President said,</p>
      <aside>Let me say that for the past two decades, Zimbabwe has been in isolation, but now since the new dispensation which came about two years ago, we want to be embraced by the rest of the nations of the international community again.<br/>To do so, we must be distinct. If you look around, you can easily see that is a Zimbabwean. So it is easy for the rest of the nations to identify us. We want to belong to the family of nations. This is the flag of my country and we are proud to carry it.<br/>There is no other meaning except that we want to be distinct and say we are Zimbabweans, we are proud to be Zimbabweans and in spite of what is happening to my country, we still remain proud.</aside>
