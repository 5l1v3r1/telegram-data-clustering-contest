      <h1>Marvel's Runaways to end after season 3 - is Disney+ to blame?</h1>

      <p>It’s been announced that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a>’s Runaways will be ending after its third season.</p>
      <p>The TV series was based on the comic book of the same name, and followed a group of six tearaway teenagers from different walks of life who have to learn to work together to fight their parents, who they learn all moonlight as supervillains.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/runaways-final-season-3-hulu-1203407868/">Variety</a>, bosses behind the show agreed that the story for the upcoming third run brought the series to its natural conclusion.</p>
      <p>The show was created and written by the creative team of Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who were also the minds behind iconic teen drama Gossip Girl.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting, however, that Runaways was one of the last live-action series in production under the Marvel Television brand. All six of Netflix’s MCU tie-ins – including Daredevil and Jessica Jones – have been culled to make way for original series for Disney+.</p>

      <p>There are a number of series in the works to air on the streaming service, including WandaVision and a Hawkeye spin-off, and with the news of Runaway’s imminent demise, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D will be the last show standing when it airs its seventh (and also final) season next year.</p>

      <p>Kevin Feige, the head honcho and guiding light of the MCU, was recently named as Marvel’s new Chief Creative Officer, and with that news <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/every-marvel-tv-series-axed-danger-kevin-feige-takes-chief-creative-officer-11040529/">came the warning that all Marvel TV series had either been axed</a> or were in danger of being axed to make way for Disney+’s limited series content.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this news does seem to have come true.</p>
      <p>Runaway’s third and final season will start airing on Hulu in the States on 13 December.</p>
      <p>In other Marvel related news, deleted scenes from Avengers: Endgame<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/avengers-endgames-deleted-katherine-langford-scene-shows-tony-starks-heartbreaking-goodbye-daughter-11083681/"> finally gave fans a glimpse at 13 Reasons Why’s Katherine Langford as Tony Stark’s daughter</a>.</p>
      <p>It was also announced that Star Wars icon Mark Hamill <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/james-gunn-breaks-hearts-as-he-insists-star-wars-legend-mark-hamill-will-not-star-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-11174803/">may not be joining James Gunn for the next Guardians of the Galaxy</a> after all.</p>
      <p>Oh, and just in case you forgot, everyone’s favourite Star-Lord<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/chris-pratt-originally-auditioned-play-captain-america-struggling-imagine-11090391/"> also originally auditioned to be Captain America</a>.</p>
