      <p>Powys County Council’s anti-poverty champion, Councillor Joy Jones is putting together a team of helpers including Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn, to bring the iconic monument to Wales for the first time.</p>
      <p>The Knife Angel is on a tour of the UK at the moment and will be outside Chester Cathedral until the end of the month.</p>
      <p>Councillor Jones, explained: “This is a very special national monument and we will be very lucky to have it here. Its purpose is 28 days of youth and anti-violence workshops and programmes.</p>
      <p>“I have asked the Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn if he would help bring this to Newtown and it is beginning to look positive.</p>
      <p>“We have a meeting with the people from the British Ironwork Centre to discuss if and when we can bring this to Newtown.</p>
      <p>Councillor Jones says that if they receive the go-ahead and a date for when the Knife Angel can be brought to Newtown, she will put together a team to help her which includes members of the council cabinet, who have been “very supportive” of her idea.</p>
      <p>Councillor Jones added: “I did put the idea on Facebook over the weekend to find out what people though of the idea and received a lot of positive messages.</p>
      <p>“I’m determined we can do this.”</p>
      <p>“I have already had offers of help in bringing the angel to Newtown as well as where to place it.”</p>
      <h3>Weapons</h3>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner, Mr Llywelyn said that they would be joining Councillor Jones at the meeting.</p>
      <p>The monument was created at the British Ironwork Centre just over the border near Oswestry and is a “national monument against violence and aggression”.</p>
      <p>The Knife Angel was created from knives collected from 43 police forces all around the country.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the British Ironwork Centre, said: “Once the knives and weapons were delivered to our workshop, artist Alfie Bradley got to work.</p>
      <p>“He created a structure out of steel and formed the basic shape which the knives could then be welded onto.</p>
      <p>“Steel sheeting formed the external, organic shape of the angel.</p>
      <p>“Each knife was blunted before welding it onto the sculpture.</p>
      <p>“The wings were then created using the blades only, creating a feather like appearance.</p>
      <p>“Working so closely with the families has been crucial in campaigning and raising awareness throughout the campaign.”</p>
      <p>Part of the the Knife Angel’s work is to promote a petition supporting a “Save a Life – Surrender you Knife” campaign that has already been signed by nearly 16,000 people.</p>
