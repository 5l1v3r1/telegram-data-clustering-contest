      <p>At least four soldiers and two civilian porters have been killed after an avalanche hit the Siachen Glacier in Indian-administered <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/kashmir.html">Kashmir</a>.</p>
      <p>The avalanche struck a group of eight soldiers patrolling near a post at a height of 5,485 metres (17,995 feet) in the northern part of the Himalayan glacier on Monday, Indian army spokesmen said.</p>

      <p>A search and rescue mission pulled eight people from the snow and they were later airlifted to a military hospital, according to the local media.</p>
      <p>"Despite best efforts, six casualties, which includes four soldiers and two civilian porters, succumbed to extreme hypothermia," spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia told the AFP news agency.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Colonel Abhinav Navneet, another army spokesman, said the two surviving soldiers were undergoing treatment.</p>
      <p>He added that an army post was also hit by the avalanche but no fatalities were reported there.</p>
      <h3>The world's highest battlefield</h3>
      <p>India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he was "deeply pained" by the incident.</p>
      <p>"Deeply pained by the demise of soldiers and porters due to avalanche in Siachen. I salute their courage and service to the nation. My heartfelt condolences to their families," Singh tweeted.</p>
      <p>The glacier is on the northern tip of the Line of Control that divides India and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The two countries, which claim the Kashmir region in full, have deployed troops at Siachen.</p>
      <p>On August 5, New Delhi stripped the Muslim-majority region of its special status and deployed additional troops, escalating tensions in one of the most militarised zones in the world.</p>
      <p>Avalanches are common on the 700-square-kilometre (270-square-mile) glacier, where temperatures regularly fall to minus 60 degrees Celsius (-76 Fahrenheit).</p>
      <p>The region has witnessed intermittent skirmishes for decades, but more soldiers have died from the harsh weather than combat at the world's highest battlefield.</p>
      <p>In 2017, at least 24 people, including 20 soldiers, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/avalanches-kills-10-indian-soldiers-kashmir-170126095124043.html">were killed</a> in a series of avalanches, while in 2012, a massive avalanche in Pakistani-administered Kashmir killed 140 people, including 129 Pakistani soldiers.</p>
