      <h3>Who is the best hip-hop, R&amp;B or grime producer/DJ of 2019?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Hip-hop is the dominant cultural force in 2019, but if anything that just makes it harder to pick a favourite producer. It's a big ask, but who do you think has earned the top spot in 2019?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We also can’t let hip-hop hoover up all the nominations here, though. That's why this category - broad, as they all are in these polls – also encompasses the worlds of trap, grime and R&amp;B. Vote now and tell us who was your personal favourite of the last 12 months.</p>
