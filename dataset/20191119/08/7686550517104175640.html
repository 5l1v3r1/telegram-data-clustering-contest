      <h1>The message Man Utd legend Sir Alex Ferguson always sends Ryan Giggs</h1>
      <h2>The Wales manager seems to be in regular contact with his former boss</h2>

      <p>Ryan Giggs has been given the backing of former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of Wales' Euro 2020 qualifier with Hungary.</p>
      <p>Saturday's victory in Azerbaijan along with Croatia's 3-1 win over Slovakia set up a winner takes all match at Cardiff City Stadium tonight.</p>
      <p>And while Giggs denied that the Scot had been in touch before the Hungary game specifically, the Wales boss revealed he receives a message from his old boss before each game.</p>
      <p>"He wished me good luck the other day for the game, which he always does," said Giggs.</p>

      <p>Giggs won everything on offer during what was a glittering career under Ferguson at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>His record of 13 Premier League title wins has never been beaten, although at international level, Giggs was never able to help fire his country to a major tournament.</p>
      <p>But Giggs admits he's solely focused on leading Wales to Euro 2020 rather than making up for the one blot on his copybook during his career as a player.</p>

      <p>"It's not about me. It's about the country as a whole," he added.</p>
      <p>"The team in 2016, whether you were involved or a fan, it was amazing. If we can re-create that atmosphere, it's fantastic.</p>
      <p>"It's not about individuals. I was a player, but that's over, now I'm a manager.</p>
      <p>"I think we've put ourselves in a great position, and we've still got one game to go."</p>
      <p>Wales face Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium at 7:45pm tonight.</p>
