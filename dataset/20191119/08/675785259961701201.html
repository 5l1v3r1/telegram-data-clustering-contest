      <h1>General election: Tory suspended after saying Holocaust events were 'exaggerated'</h1>
      <h2>Ryan Houghton, the Conservative candidate for Aberdeen North, has faced calls to be expelled from the party after comments he made a number of years ago online emerged</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:08:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:08</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>A Tory candidate has been suspended from the party after comments he made online about the Holocaust emerged.</p>
      <p>Ryan Houghton, the Conservative candidate for Aberdeen North, made a number of vile sexist, racist and homophobic statements on a martial arts forum a number of years ago.</p>
      <p>In the posts, uncovered by <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18044656.aberdeen-tory-candidate-ryan-houghton-racist-tweets-uncovered/">The National,</a> Mr Houghton:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>suggested some elements of the Holocaust were “fabricated”</li>
        <li>encouraged a debate about whether of the events of Holocaust were "exaggerated by the victors"</li>
        <li>praised the disgraced historian and Holocaust denier David Irving as “interesting”</li>
        <li>claimed that “mainstream Islam” would lead to an “apartheid situation” for Christians and Jews in Europe</li>
        <li>stated Muslims were having big families in big to create "Eurabia"</li>
        <li>said he didn't see how homosexuality was good for the human race</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Using the username Razgriz, Hougton wrote on the forum that there is “no credible evidence to suggest the Holocaust did not happen”.</p>
      <p>He continued: “I do find some of the events fabricated, and exegarated [sic] in some cases.</p>
      <p>“As history is written by the victors there is always going to be a bit of re-writing.”</p>
      <p>In further posts on a poker forum, he:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>repeatedly shared pornography</li>
        <li>boasted about "smashing birds"</li>
        <li>bragged about spending his winnings on Tag Heuer watches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Scottish Conservatives said it had withdrawn its support for Ryan Houghton, while condemning "all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism".</p>
      <p>Mr Houghton, who has been a councillor since 2017, said the newspaper had taken a "selective look" at comments he made in discussions about terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism and vowed to clear his name.</p>

      <p>He said that in the discussions seven years ago, when he was 20, he referenced the views of discredited historian and Holocaust denier David Irving but had made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending them.</p>
      <p>Mr Houghton said in a statement on Monday evening: "I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish Community in Aberdeen."</p>
      <p>He said he had "never held anti-Semitic or intolerant views".</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: "The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result.</p>
      <p>"The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North.</p>

      <p>"The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism."</p>
      <p>Mr Houghton said following his suspension: "As a party we have been quick to call out the comments by others and should act equally swiftly when an allegation of a similar kind is made against one of our own members."</p>
      <p>While saying he was saddened by the newspaper's "reluctance to apply analysis to the context of a discussion", he said: "I will fully cooperate with the investigation by the party and look forward to clearing my name."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> has called for him to be expelled from the Tory party.</p>
      <p>SNP candidate for Aberdeen North Kirsty Blackman said: "These comments are utterly horrifying and voters will be appalled that the Tories considered Mr Houghton a suitable candidate.</p>
      <p>"Holocaust denial is deeply anti-Semitic as well as extraordinarily distressing for survivors and the families of victims.</p>
      <p>"A man with these views is clearly not a suitable candidate to be an MP, and this raises very serious questions not just about the Scottish Tories' vetting procedures but also about the type of views that are circulating in the party.</p>
      <p>"Suspending Mr Houghton is the bare minimum - the Tories must permanently expel Mr Houghton and make clear that they do not consider these views appropriate in public life."</p>
