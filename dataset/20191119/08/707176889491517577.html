      <h1>UK government set to approve Cobham takeover by Advent</h1>
      <h2>Ruling follows 3-week inquiry into deal’s national security implications</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:56:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author">Peggy Hollinger</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson’s government plans to wave through the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3e463652-ae6d-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2">acquisition</a> of Cobham, the UK aerospace and defence supplier, by US buyout group Advent International on condition that the new owner strengthens security around sensitive sites and informs the Ministry of Defence of any plans to sell the business.</p>
      <p>The ruling follows a three-week inquiry into the national security implications of the takeover. The undertakings being demanded by business secretary Andrea Leadsom are weaker than those demanded by her predecessor Greg Clark in the takeover of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d236b11e-3404-11e8-ae84-494103e73f7f">GKN</a> by turnround group Melrose Industries. In that deal, Mr Clark demanded the right to veto the disposal of sensitive defence assets.</p>
      <p>Cobham shares rose nearly 4 per cent on the news to 160.81p.</p>
      <p>After consultation with the Ministry of Defence and companies involved, the government has set certain conditions including the requirement to ensure existing security arrangements protecting sensitive operations and information “will continue to be strengthened,” and that any new board structures comply with national security requirements.</p>
      <p>Cobham’s new owners will have to honour the terms of existing contracts, notify the Ministry of Defence in advance if there is a material change to Cobham’s ability to supply key services and promise not to withdraw certain services for an agreed period.</p>
      <p>Finally Advent will have to give the Ministry of Defence notice if it decides to sell all or part of Cobham.</p>
      <p>The business minister said that if these conditions were not met, she was minded to refer the deal for further examination. However, as many of the conditions already cover security at Cobham’s sensitive sites, Advent is expected to comply.</p>

      <p>The secretary of state said she “considers that the proposed undertakings would mitigate the national security risks identified to an acceptable level”.</p>
      <p>The deal, announced in July, values Cobham at £4bn, and is the first high-profile takeover of a British company since Mr Johnson took over as prime minister in July. It has been <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fc2aa490-cef8-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f">opposed</a> by the family of the founder, who have argued that its acquisition by a foreign private equity buyer is a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d60f30b0-b69c-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c">national security concern</a>.</p>
      <p>Concerns have also been raised by a number of MPs as well as former executives of the company.</p>
      <p>Cobham’s pioneering air-to-air refuelling technology is used on all western fast jets, and it is a key supplier of components for the F-35 fighter and to the US military’s electronic warfare and radar capability. It employs more than 10,000 people and makes critical components it says are found in every Airbus passenger jet manufactured today and parts that prevent fuel tank explosions on the A320 aeroplane.</p>
      <p>Shonnel Malani, a partner at Advent, said: “Following the CMA’s [Competition and Markets Authority] review, we have worked closely with the Ministry of Defence to construct undertakings that would adequately mitigate against any potential national security risks and we welcome today’s decision by the secretary of state to propose to accept those undertakings, subject to consultation.”</p>
      <p>Advent is offering Cobham shareholders 165p a share in cash, a premium of 34 per cent to the group’s closing price of 123p on the eve of the offer and a 50.3 per cent premium to the average price over the three months before the bid.</p>
      <p>The minister’s decision will now be subject to public consultation until December 17.</p>
