      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Assistant head coach John Terry has playfully taunted Celtic's Scott Sinclair about his gym activity with the former Chelsea man posting online</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:25:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:25</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa assistant head coach John Terry has sent a brilliant five-word message to Celtic star Scott Sinclair.</p>
      <p>The pair were team-mates at Chelsea, with Sinclair joining in 2005 from boyhood club Bristol Rovers.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> loanee Sinclair spent five years at Stamford Bridge, making just five League appearances, before heading to Swansea City.</p>
      <p>At the Liberty Stadium was where he made his name, earning a move to Manchester City as a result of his good performances for the swashbuckling Swans.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/scott-sinclair">Sinclair</a> is now at Celtic, but he doesn't get a look in these days making just six appearances this season - just two of those coming in the Scottish Premirship.</p>
      <p>Judging by his social media activity he is keeping himself in tip-top shape, though - he posted a picture on Instagram yesterday of himself with the caption: "No matter what the situation, I’m focused and ready..!"</p>
      <p>While Sinclair was obviously trying to be serious, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-terry">Terry</a> couldn't help himself, replying: "don’t forget the legs geez."</p>
