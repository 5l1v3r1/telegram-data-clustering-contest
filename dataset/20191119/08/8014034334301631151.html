      <p>BERLIN — German Chancellor Angela Merkel is hosting the G20 Compact with Africa summit in Berlin with the goal of increasing investment in the continent to improve living standards there.</p>
      <p>Merkel and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi are expected to address the summit Tuesday. Others attending include leaders of Ethiopia, Benin, Ghana, Morocco and Tunisia.</p>
      <p>Merkel said both Europe and Africa will profit. She told ARD public television that “we should do everything to co-operate with Africa, not to talk about Africa, but to do something together.”</p>
      <p>The Compact with Africa was initiated in 2017 during Germany’s G20 presidency.</p>
