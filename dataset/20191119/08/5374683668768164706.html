      <h2>In bid to form a right-wing government, brokers offer compromise deal to Yisrael Beytenu and haredi parties to break ongoing deadlock.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:57:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author">Arutz Sheva Staff</a></address>
      <p>Negotiators trying to cobble together a narrow right-wing government have put together a new compromise deal, offering the plan to Yisrael Beytenu and haredi lawmakers in a bid to resolve the ongoing dispute between the two sides, and pave the way for a new right-wing government.</p>
      <p>According to a report by <i>Reshet Bet</i> Tuesday morning, officials working to broker a deal between Yisrael Beytenu and the haredi Shas and United Torah Judaism parties have offered a new compromise arrangement aimed at bringing both sides into a new right-wing government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.</p>
      <p>Under the proposed compromise deal, the haredi parties would cede a number of powerful positions they have held since 2015, including the Interior Ministry portfolio, currently held by Shas chief Aryeh Deri, and leadership of the Knessetâ€™s Finance Committee, currently held by UTJ MK Moshe Gafni.</p>
      <p>In exchange for these concessions, Yisrael Beytenu would waive its demands for changes to the status quo on religion and state, including civil marriage, state-funded public transportation on the Sabbath, and tougher rules for yeshiva students seeking army exemptions.</p>
      <p>The plan was released by <i>Reshet Bet</i> Tuesday, just ahead of <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271893">a meeting</a> between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Yisrael Beytenu chief Avidgor Liberman.</p>
      <p>In preparation, Netanyahu met yesterday with the right-wing - religious bloc's leaders, discussing how far some would compromise in order to bring Lieberman into the fold.</p>
      <p>The meeting comes less than two days before Blue and White chief Benny Gantz loses the mandate to form a new government, which expires at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday night.</p>
