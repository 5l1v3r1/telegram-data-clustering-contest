      <h1>Showtime for Stadia cloud gaming service (Update)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:39:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:39</time> by <a rel="author">Glenn Chapman</a></address>
      <p>Google set out to transform the video game world Tuesday with the launch of a Stadia service crafted to let people access console-quality games as easily as they do email.</p>
      <p>Within moments of Google flipping the switch to turn on Stadia, gamers began firing off complaints from sluggish play action to not receiving kits or access codes.</p>
      <p>Some gamers, notoriously protective of their world, lashed out at the very notion of disrupting the reliance on consoles or personal computers with a service that hosts titles in the cloud and promises access on smartphones, tablets and more.</p>
      <p>An MBG channel at YouTube that spotlights PlayStation console tweeted that Stadia was flopping.</p>
      <p>"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't smiling," MBG said in the tweet.</p>
      <p>"Maybe that's cynical but I can't support a company who is pushing for a cloud only gaming future. Stadia simply can't compete with PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo or PC."</p>
      <p>Stadia critics also questioned the value of paying a monthly subscription to the service, only to have to buy games if they want to play titles other than the few available with memberships.</p>
      <p>Google is aiming for a piece of a global video game industry expected to top $150 billion this year by using its cloud computing technology offering rich features without the need for consoles.</p>
      <p>Google last month sold out of "Founder's Edition" kits, which are priced at $129. Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.</p>

        <figcaption>"Assassin's Creed Odyssey" is among the games available on the Google Stadia streaming service being launched this week, aiming to allow users to play popular titles without consoles</figcaption>

      <p>Stadia games are also playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers as well as with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward.</p>
      <p>Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at $10 a month in the US, will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe.</p>
      <p>Subscribers are able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data centers, but some free games will be available to them, starting with "Destiny 2: The Collection."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Game on</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stadia on smartphones, at the start, works with WiFi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services.</p>
      <p>Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be.</p>
      <p>Some promised features such as integration with YouTube were not in place at launch.</p>
      <p>Google appeared to be committed to making Stadia a success, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early.</p>
      <p>The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.</p>

        <figcaption>"Cyberpunk 2077," whose exhibit during the E3 Video Game Convention is seen here, is among the games coming to Google Stadia</figcaption>

      <p>"From what I have seen, their plans are too deep; they are too good, and they are too invested," Early said. "They are not calling it quits any time soon."</p>
      <p>He expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.</p>
      <p>"If there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn't the end of the world," he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.</p>
      <p>Stadia aims to lead the way to hosting titles in data centers, letting people use whatever gadgets they wish to access console-quality play.</p>
      <p>US technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform that it plans to make available on Windows-powered personal computers next year.</p>
      <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has a PlayStation Now service that combines cloud gaming and title downloads that is synched to its latest-generation consoles and Windows-powered personal computers.</p>
      <p>Having titles sit on powerful servers in the cloud could allow for unprecedented features such as thousands of people playing simultaneously or environments as detailed as the real world.</p>
      <p>The Google move follows the launch of the Apple Arcade mobile game service, which offers custom game apps downloaded to devices. A rival Google Play Pass charges the same $4.99 monthly subscription price as that of Arcade, which focuses on games for Apple iOS devices</p>
