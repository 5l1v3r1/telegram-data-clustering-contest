      <h2>The Republic of Ireland will learn their opponents on Friday morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:52:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland will have to successfully navigate their way through playoffs if they are to reach Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's side played out a 1-1 draw with Denmark on Monday night, which means they finished third in the qualifying group behind Switzerland and the Danes.</p>
      <p>A goal from Martin Braithwaite gave the visitors the lead at the Aviva before Matt Doherty levelled for the Boys in Green.</p>
      <p>Here's everything you need to know about the play-offs draw:</p>
      <h3>When is the draw?</h3>
      <p>It will be made on Friday, November 22.</p>

      <h3>What time does it start at?</h3>

      <h3>Who could Ireland play in the play-offs?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/republic-of-ireland-football-team">Ireland</a> could play Bosnia, Wales, Slovakia and Northern Ireland depending on the result of Wales' match with Hungary.</p>
      <p>They will go into a one-legged semi-final before a final three days later. </p>
      <h3>When will the play-off semi-finals take place?</h3>

      <p>The semi-finals of the paths take place on March 26th with the highest ranked team in each tie playing at home.</p>
      <p>The finals take place on March 31st with the hosts decided by a draw. The semi-finals and finals are both single leg ties.</p>
      <h3>When is the Euro 2020 draw?</h3>
      <p>The draw for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/euro-2020">the tournament</a> will take place on Saturday 30 November.</p>
      <p>It is set to start in Bucharest at 5pm (Irish time).</p>
      <h3>How does the draw work?</h3>
      <p>Each team will be put into a designed pot. There are four pots altogether with six teams in each pot. The pots are ranked 1-4 with the highest seeded teams in pot 1, the next highest in pot 2 and so on...</p>
      <p>However, as there are 12 host nations, each nation that qualifies (or could qualify via the play-offs) is placed in one of the following groups so that they are guaranteed to be at home in at least two group games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Group A: Italy, Azerbaijan</li>
        <li>Group B: Russia, Denmark</li>
        <li>Group C: Netherlands, Romania</li>
        <li>Group D: England, Scotland</li>
        <li>Group E: Spain, Republic of Ireland</li>
        <li>Group F: Germany, Hungary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If both teams from each of these groups qualify, another draw will be held to determine which team plays at home.</p>
      <p>In short, if Ireland qualify for Euro 2020, we know already that we will be guaranteed to be in Group E with Spain.</p>
      <p>When will the group stage take place?</p>
      <p>The group stage matches will take place between 12-24 June.</p>
      <h3>Where could Ireland play their matches?</h3>
      <p>If Ireland qualify for Euro 2020 via the playoffs, they will play two group matches at the Aviva in Dublin and will take on Spain in Bilbao.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If Ireland win Group E they will play...</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Last 16: Glasgow</li>
        <li>QF: Rome</li>
        <li>SF: Wembley</li>
        <li>Final: Wembley</li>
