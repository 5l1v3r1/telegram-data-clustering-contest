      <h2>Kieron Smith has a troubled past - with a stint in jail - but his mum fears unless he can find somewhere to stay he may die</h2>

      <p>A mum fears her homeless son will die this winter unless he finds somewhere to live.</p>
      <p>Kieron Smith currently sleeps in either tent on a muddy field or his mum's garden shed.</p>
      <p>He has a troubled past, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/benwell-thug-kieron-smith-attacked-8579464">including a spell prison</a> and drug abuse, while he suffers with autism, ADHD and mental health issues.</p>

      <p>Having been moved around the North East, he claims it has taken 19 years to even get a social worker and feels he isn't being given the help he needs to try and make a fresh start.</p>
      <p>But all his heartbroken mum wants is for someone to help her son - before it is too late.</p>
      <p>"The tent is on a big field about five minutes from our home," said mum-of-three Pamela Laanani, from Alnwick.</p>
      <p>"Recently I hadn't seen him for a few days so I wondered up to the tent to check he was ok.</p>
      <p>"I unzipped it and I expected to find his corpse inside.</p>
      <p>"To my relief there wasn't, but there were empty packets of tablets scattered around as he had taken an overdose.</p>

      <p>"My heart is breaking and I don't know what to do - I keep thinking will I bury my son."</p>
      <p>She claims the 26-year-old is barred from sleeping at her Sycamore Avenue home by social services.</p>
      <p>With two young children, Pamela claims officials fear Kieron - who has convictions for violence - could pose a risk to their safety.</p>
      <p>For Kieron though, he claims he's stuck between a rock and a hard place after being released from jail.</p>
      <p>Once able to lift over 200lbs, his weight has plummeted to nine stone.</p>
      <p>Unable to fill in paperwork properly and with mental health issues which affect his decision making, he claims he's reached out to get the support he needs - only to be told no.</p>
      <p>Now he fears his story is just like thousands of other men who are "tossed from pillar to post" by services, without the meaningful help they desperately need.</p>
      <p>He said: "If you looked at me story wise that has been in the Chronicle and I'd look like a w*****.</p>
      <p>"But meet me face to face, people say that I don't seem like that sort of person and that's because I'm not.</p>
      <p>"I got dragged into the wrong crowd, and had issues with education. But when I ask for help, I get sent from pillar to post because of my past.</p>
      <p>"And I've been to services who only go to refer me on to other services."</p>
      <p>He claims he has approached charities for help curbing his cannabis use only to be told no.</p>
      <p>He added: "It is moronic to say to someone get off the drugs first, then we can help you.</p>
      <p>"I understand now why people go back to jail, because when you ask for the help and try and go to the right places - but the services just throw it back in their faces.</p>
      <p>"It seems to be the only way you get to the services is to lie, when you want to be open, honest and truthful."</p>
      <p>For his mum, his issues mean she has little choice but to leave him in the cold.</p>
      <p>"It means I have to pick between my two youngest, who I have a duty to care for, but also my other son when my biggest worry is that he will either kill himself or freeze to death," said an emotional Pamela, 45.</p>
      <p>"It is a horrendous choice.</p>
      <p>"My son shouldn't have to be sleeping rough, yet he's out there in the freezing cold and rain.</p>
      <p>"But if I get caught with him in the house, I could get in trouble but he is still my son - so what can I do?"</p>
      <p>Since moving to Alnwick from Benwell two years ago, she claims she's pleaded with Northumberland County Council to find him a home - even filling in forms on his behalf - only to be told no.</p>

      <p>Now with temperatures set to plunge, she has pleaded with the council for a change of heart.</p>
      <p>A Northumberland County Council spokesperson said: "We are aware of this case and are looking at a range of options, including support from partners, to assist this man.</p>
      <p>"Having assessed his current personal position and need, we do not believe that there is a statutory duty to provide emergency accommodation, but this will be kept under review."</p>
      <p>For Keiron, whose convictions include aggravated burglary and having an imitation firearm, he doesn't want his history to stop him freezing this winter - or to stop him moving on with his life.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately with the past that I've had, it has caused some complications at home.</p>
      <p>"I've been a little b***** in the past and as soon as there's an incident at home, it is easy for social services to say I'm the cause.</p>
      <p>"But I'm homeless - I either live in a tent most of the time, or the odd night in my mam's shed or a friend's sofa.</p>
      <p>"It just isn't a great situation for me."</p>
