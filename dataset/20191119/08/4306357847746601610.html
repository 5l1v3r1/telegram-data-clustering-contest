      <h1>‘Pure quality’: Roy Keane gives glowing verdict on Man United striker</h1>
      <h2>Roy Keane says Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford is back to his best after his goal in England's 4-0 win on Sunday</h2>

      <h3>Roy Keane believes Marcus Rashford has rediscovered his top form after the Manchester United striker scored in a 4-0 win over Kosovo on Sunday night.</h3>
      <p>The 22-year-old came off the bench in the second half to find the net with an instinctive finish to extend England’s lead to three goals.</p>
      <p>Rashford has been in red hot form for the 20-time English champions over the past couple of months.</p>
      <p>The Manchester United striker has netted nine times and has made one assist in his last 10 games for club and country.</p>
      <p>Rashford’s form will come as a relief to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer given Manchester United’s lack of options up front at present.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United captain Keane was impressed with Rashford’s quality finish in England’s 4-0 rout of Kosovo.</p>
      <p>“Brilliant, brilliant goal,” Keane said during <i>ITV’s</i> coverage of England’s win.</p>
      <p>“What a finish. He is back to his best. It was a lovely play, nice and simple. Does it matter about the opposition? Of course it does, because they’re getting opportunities, but that was the goal of the night. A lovely finish. Pure quality.”</p>
      <p>Keane went on to say that England boss Gareth Southgate has three excellent options to lead his attack in the shape of Rashford, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Keane added: “The attacking three players you’d have at the minute are [Raheem] Sterling, [Harry] Kane and Rashford. The three of them are outstanding players who cause you all sorts of headaches.”</p>
      <p>Rashford will be hoping to extend his prolific run when Manchester United take on Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are in seventh position in the Premier League table and nine points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will be hoping to improve upon their sixth-placed finish last term after Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho midway through the season.</p>
