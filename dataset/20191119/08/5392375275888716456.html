      <p>Huawei Mate 30 Pro launches in Europe with a mouth-watering offer<br/>5 (100%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>Chinese smartphone giant Huawei back in September at an event in Germany refreshed its premium range of smartphones with the launch of the Huawei Mate 30, and Huawei Mate 30 Pro. The flagship duo is the firm’s response to the premium Galaxy Note 10, and the latest iPhone range of products. But while the aforementioned devices are already available in stores globally, the Mate 30 Pro, and of course the Mate 30 is still exclusive to China.</p>
      <p>The Shenzhen-based tech giant is having tough times releasing the device outside of its home market as it failed to get Google’s approval for the inclusion of the full-fledged Google Play Services because of the US ban.</p>
      <p>Well, the device is <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/28/huawei-mate-30-series-to-land-in-europe-in-mid-november/">finally</a> now on sale in Madrid, Spain, but with limited availability, and a mouth-watering promo offer. The device is available only at <b><a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/es/espacio-huawei/">Huawei Space store in Madrid</a> as there is currently no guarantee it will be available in other sales channels.</b></p>
      <p>You can immediately purchase the Huawei Mate 30 Pro via Huawei’s Space Store in Space Silver (gray) color at a <b>price of 1,099 euros.</b> Interestingly, the Chinese firm is offering a mouth-watering offer in the form of a 299 euros discount coupon. The coupon is redeemable at the Space store for the purchase of other Huawei products. The promo lasts till December 9, though we are not sure there are enough stocks that could last till the said date.</p>
      <h3>Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Manual Play services</h3>
      <p>Due to the US government’s ban that restricts companies in the States from dealing with Huawei, the Chinese firm had to resort to the use of <i>open</i>–<i>source Android with</i> EMUI 10. This essentially means it ships without Google Play Services. However, users in Spain can but users can “<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/23/huawei-mate-30-this-is-how-to-install-google-play-store-quickly/">manually install</a>” the Play services, but only through Huawei Space in Madrid, Spain. Besides launching in Spain, reports are rife that the device will soon land in France.</p>
