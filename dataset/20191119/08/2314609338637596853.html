      <p>Luka Doncic poured in a career-high 42 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and recorded 12 assists to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 117-110 win over the visiting San Antonio Spurs on Monday for their second straight victory.</p>
      <p>The triple-double was the 20-year-old Doncic's league-leading sixth of the young season. He became just the second player, after LeBron James, to record a 40-point triple-double before the age of 21 in NBA history.</p>

      <p>Dorian Finney-Smith's lunging shot after a wild scramble barely beat the shot clock to push Dallas' lead to 112-107 with 1:14 to play. Rudy Gay's 3-point jumper with 43.6 seconds to play brought the Spurs back to within two points, but Doncic answered with a 3-pointer 16 seconds later that cemented the game for the Mavericks.</p>
      <p>Finney-Smith had 22 points for Dallas, Kristaps Porzingis added 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Jalen Brunson scored 11 points in the win.</p>
      <p>DeMar DeRozan scored a season-high 36 points for the reeling Spurs, who lost their sixth straight game. San Antonio hadn't lost that many in a row since the 2010-11 season, when it dropped six straight in March and April. The Spurs went on to finish that regular season with 61 wins.</p>

      <p>LaMarcus Aldridge added 16 points for San Antonio with Bryn Forbes hitting for 13. Australian Patty Mills added nine points off the Spurs' bench.</p>
      <p>Doncic was on fire from the opening tip, scoring 17 points in the first quarter on 5-of-7 shooting that included making 4 of 6 attempts from beyond the arc. He had 24 points at half-time.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Australian Aron Baynes' resurgent Phoenix Suns have proved no match for his former team, the NBA-leading Boston Celtics.</p>

      <p>The Suns lost star point guard Ricky Rubio to back spams shortly beforehand, then lost their match 99-85 in Phoenix on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Off-season recruit Baynes started against his ex-teammates and managed nine points with five assists and six rebounds.</p>
      <p>Boston (11-2) had a 10-game winning streak snapped on Sunday by the Sacramento Kings but bounced back with a relatively easy road victory as Jayson Tatum scored 26 points and Kemba Walker added 19.</p>
      <p>In Utah, Dante Exum played his first game for the season after knee surgery in March, scoring two points in 14 minutes as the Jazz lost 112-102 to Minnesota. Karl-Anthony Towns matched his career high of seven 3-pointers and contributed 29 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves.</p>
      <p>Exum's compatriot Joe Ingles had 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists for Utah.</p>
      <p>In New York, the Knicks were far too good for Cleveland, running out 123-105 winners. Matthew Dellavedova scored five points in 12 minutes for the Cavs, who dropped to 4-9 for the season.</p>
