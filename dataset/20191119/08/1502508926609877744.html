      <p>Rightsizing Railway Board: Transfer orders of 50 officers to zones issued</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-railways">Indian Railways </a>has pruned the Railway Board by 25 per cent, cutting down its strength from 200 to 150 by transferring director-level officials and above to zones in a long pending move to enhance efficiency, according to an official order.</p>
      <p>The transfer orders of these 50 officials were issued on Monday, sources said.</p>
      <p>"This is part of the PM's vision of less bureaucracy. Less government maximum governance. These officials have gone where their work will be most effectively utilised, " a senior official said.</p>
      <p>The transferred officers are from across railway cadres - 10 each from IRSE and IRTS, seven from IRAS, six from IRSME, five each from IRSEE and IRSSE, three each from IRSS and IRPS and one from RPF.</p>
      <p>The plan was first mooted in 2000 by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, which recommended rightsizing of the apex decision making body of the national transporter.</p>
