        <b>SCOTRAIL told a customer to "arrive earlier" after a complaint about ticket queues as a campaign against fare-dodging sparked fury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rail bosses took to social media last night to announce they were cracking down on those who don't pay for journeys.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They shared a Tweet that featured a ticket wearing a robber's mask - urging punters to "buy before you board".</p>
      <p>But some responses from ScotRail were panned by fuming punters.</p>
      <p>The firm said: "Does your station have a ticket machine or a ticket office? Buy Before You Board.</p>

        <figcaption>The exchange on Twitter</figcaption>

      <p>"Travelling without buying a ticket is fare evasion.</p>
      <p>"We’re clamping down".</p>
      <p>A number of customers complained about facilities at stations, including automated ticket machines.</p>

      <p>And there were alleged issues with smartcard top-ups ahead of travelling on services.</p>
      <p>One person complained about queues at a ticket machine at a station in the south side of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>They said: "I travel from Shawlands station where there can be 20+ people in the queue for the single ticket machine.</p>
      <p>"What are people supposed to do?"</p>
      <p>ScotRail then responded with a Tweet that has since been deleted saying: "Arrive a bit earlier.</p>
      <p>"Thanks, ^ MF".</p>
      <p>Screengrabs of the exchange have now been widely shared on social media - with people fuming at the tone of the message.</p>
      <p>Another punter said in response to the crackdown: "This is a bit cheeky!</p>

      <p>"Lucky to get a standing space on a train going anywhere cause ScotRail don't have enough carriages or staff yet this campaign is where they want to put their time, energy and money".</p>
      <p>And one passenger said on Twitter: "You should rethink the tone of this tweet.</p>
      <p>"Ticket offices are chronically understaffed and ticket machines frequently out of order or slow as a week in the jail".</p>
      <p>A ScotRail spokesperson said: “Revenue protection and reducing ticketless travel have always been priorities for ScotRail.</p>
      <p>“It’s a small minority of passengers who deliberately try to avoid paying the proper fare but it’s honest, fare-paying customers who bear the burden of lost investment on Scotland's Railway.</p>
      <p>“We have implemented a number of measures to make it easier for customers to buy before boarding, including ScotRail smartcards, and new and upgraded self-service ticket machines across the network.”</p>
      <p>Bosses said that customers had a number of ways they could purchase their ticket before boarding.</p>
      <p>Among them were buying fares online via the ScotRail website or mobile app, in person at a ticket office, or by using a self-service ticket machine.</p>
      <p>We told you last week we told how it was claimed that stations <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4943185/scotrail-trains-stations-times-toilets-paper/">hit by ScotRail cuts were begging each other for toilet rolls.</a></p>
      <p>Leaked messages show staff joking about trading Sellotape, pens and Tippex for loo paper.</p>
      <p>Others slammed the lack of soap and hand towels in workers’ rest areas.</p>
