      <p>The host recently confirmed that there would be a new Chaser joining The Beast, The Vixen, The Sinnerman, The Governess and The Dark Destroyer.</p>
      <p>However, it looks like there are even more changes in store when the show returns to air - including the possibility of multiple <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/bradley-walsh-reveals-new-chaser-joining-chase-342752"><i>new Chasers</i></a>.</p>
      <p>"We're making more and more shows all the time, so we need to recruit more people all the time", he told <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-11-18/bradley-walsh-the-chase-shake-up/"><i>Radio Times</i></a>.</p>

      <p>He continued: "So consequently, we have put our feelers out to find other people that will be suitable, and all will be revealed next year,"</p>
      <p>"It could be more than one, who knows. But it's a proper shake-up."</p>
      <p>The news comes after Chaser The Vixen, otherwise known as <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/jenny-ryan-responds-claims-miming-x-factor-celebrity-341411"><i>Jenny Ryan</i></a>, blew everyone away during her time on The X Factor: Celebrity.</p>
