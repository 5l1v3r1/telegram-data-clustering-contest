      <p>The restart rules for this year were change so that the start/finish line marked the green flag point upon restarts from when a safety car returned to the pits rather than the safety car line at the pit entry.<br/> <br/>Verstappen waited as long as he could before accelerating before the line to ensure he didn’t give those behind a slipstream down to turn one.<br/> <br/><i>“Verstappen was particularly strong at the second re-start, when he slowed the field right down with the aim of ensuring no one would be able to slipstream past him and snatch victory,” </i>said Brawn as quoted by <i>MotorsportWeek</i>.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“It was an exciting and fascinating re-start which will be analysed very carefully, as the closeness of the pack in the seconds leading up the green flags resulted in a thrilling spectacle as drivers jockeyed for position and where the slightest advantage proved decisive.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“Examining the possibility of procedurally recreating those conditions in future is an interesting concept and one that will undoubtedly be explored in the coming period.”</i><br/> <br/>Brawn also praised the Dutchman on his win at Interlagos for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> making a statement to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> for 2020.<br/> <br/><i>“Red Bull was definitely the best package on the day but Max, too, was in superb form,” </i>he added.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“He didn’t waver, he trusted the judgement of his engineers and strategists, and he delivered a winning drive of pace, power and precision.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“Of Max’s three wins this year, this was the one where the Red Bull-Honda package was at its best, as it seems to have closed on if not actually matched the level of its rivals.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“There’s only one race to go, but the Milton Keynes team and the Japanese manufacturer have laid down a strong marker for 2020.”</i></p>
