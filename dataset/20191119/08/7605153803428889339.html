        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 19 – Kenyan courts are among top five most corrupt institutions, a new graft perception index by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has shown.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report released Tuesday ranked courts the fifth on the graft perception index in the 2018 National Corruption Survey at 8.6 per cent.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The police, Kenya Power, National Hospital Insurance Fund and National Youth Service topped the chart at 39.6 per cent, 12.9 per cent, 11.1 per cent and 9.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>EACC Director of Preventive Services Vincent Okongo while releasing the report said National Lands Commission was also in the list of the most corrupt at 8.1 per cent. Kenya Revenue Authority followed at 6.8 per cent.</p>
      <p>Okongo further stated that the average bribe paid dropped from Sh5,058.75 in the 2017 survey to Sh3,833.14 in 2018 this figure being the lowest recorded since 2012.</p>
      <p>“We noticed that the number of Kenyans who seek government services has increased and that is a good gesture and also the amount paid for bribe reduced and we hope as times passes, people will not continue to pay bribe to acquire services,” he said.</p>
      <p>The research report further indicated that the average times a bribe was demanded declined from 1.57 times in 2017 to 1.33 times with a minimum of one and a maximum of nine times.</p>
      <p>Some 32.4 per cent of respondents stated that they would engage in corruption if they had the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, only 5.8 per cent of the respondents compared to 6.7 per cent in 2017 admitted having reported the malpractice.</p>
      <p>In  survey that  sampled a population of 5,942 who were interviewed for the period between November 16 to December 19 last year,  corruption for the second year running topped the list of major challenges facing the country at 49.4 per cent, followed by unemployment at 36.8 per cent, famine 27.2 per cent, high cost of living at 16.9 per cent and unfavorable economic conditions at 11 per cent.</p>
      <p>Comparatively perceptions about levels of corruption have significantly been declining from 2016 at 79.3 per cent which was the peak recorded to 63.3 per cent documented in 2018.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Office of the Registrar of persons and public hospitals were ranked the most corruption prone.</p>
      <p>The two were ranked first and second at 19.9 per cent and 19.7 per cent</p>
      <p>EACC Chairperson Archbishop (Rtd) Most Reverend Eliud Wabukala urged Kenyans to exercise patience in a bid to fight the urge of wanting to bribe or be bribed all in an effort to fight corruption in the country, a menace that continues to rid of the country billion of shillings in revenues.</p>
      <p>“The statistics have indeed shown that Kenyans are not patient. My advice to them is that if we are to win this war, we need to have patience. No one should be bribed to offer you a government service because you have already paid tax. Let us focus on being genuine citizen because a service to man is a service to God,” he urged.</p>
