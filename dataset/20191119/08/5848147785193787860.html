      <h1>Prince Andrew could sweat over fresh scandal as supporters step back</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:02:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew is facing fresh allegations about – to use his phrase – behavior unbecoming of a royal, amid reports he used racist language in a conversation with a former political adviser.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York is facing growing calls to give a formal statement to American authorities including the FBI who are working to identify alleged human trafficking victims of late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>On Monday it was reported <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-loses-spin-doctor/">Andrew’s spin doctor quit</a> over his decision to be interviewed on the BBC’s <i>Newsnigh</i>t.</p>
      <p>Now the fallout from his <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-testify-epstein/">appearance on the BBC</a> to explain his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations of having sex with an under-age teen has extended to Andrew’s not-for-profit organization.</p>
      <p>Major accounting firm KPMG has pulled out of its sponsorship of Andrew’s mentoring program Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>The controversy over the duke’s ties to Epstein is understood to have been a factor in the move, according to the BBC.</p>
      <p>Adding to the corporate woes, a front page story on Tuesday morning (Australian time) in UK newspaper <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/prince-andrew-caught-in-nword-row-former-downing-street-aide-rohan-silva-accuses-duke-of-york-of-a4289516.html"><i>The Evening Standard </i></a>alleging Andrew used the racially offensive ‘N-word.’</p>
      <p>The duke made a racist remark during a 2012 meeting at Buckingham Palace, according to Downing Street aide turned columnist Rohan Silva.</p>

      <p>Mr Silva said he asked the Queen’s son whether the government department responsible for trade “could be doing a better job”, according to the <i>Evening Standard</i>.</p>
      <p>He claims the prince replied, “Well, if you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the [N-word] in the woodpile.”</p>
      <p>Mr Silva said he left the palace “reeling at the prince’s use of language.” The newspaper quoted sources who categorically denied the allegation, saying “the duke did not say that.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a second organization is considering its future association with Andrew.</p>
      <p>Outward Bound Trust – of which the duke is patron – has announced it will hold a board meeting in the next few days when members will discuss the issues raised in the controversial BBC interview.</p>
      <p>And a student committee at Huddersfield University, where Andrew is chancellor, has voted on a motion to lobby the duke to resign. The result of the ballot is to be published later this week.</p>
      <p>Old photographs also surfaced in the UK’s <i>Daily Mail </i>and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/glistening-sweat-very-handsy-prince-20905458"><i>Mirror </i></a>seemingly showing the senior royal looking wide-eyed while dancing – and sweating – during a party with US socialites.</p>

      <p>The snaps were unearthed after claims made by the prince to <i>Newsnight</i> about his medical history and personal behaviour.</p>
      <p>Epstein ‘sex slave’ Virginia Robert, now Giuffre, alleged to<i> 60 Minutes</i> on November 10 she was 17 when she danced with Andrew at London’s Tramp nightclub in 2001 before being told “I have to do what I did for Jeffrey for Prince Andrew.”</p>
      <p>The prince said he could not recall ever having met “this lady” and denied having sex with her: “It didn’t happen”.</p>

      <p>Ms Giuffre, who now lives in Australia with her husband and children, <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/10/prince-andrew-epstein-jail/">told <i>60 Minutes</i> </a> she remembered Andrew from the night in 2001 because he “sweats a lot and he smells funny”.</p>
      <p>He rebutted Ms Giuffre’s recall of his body odor with a medical explanation.</p>
      <p>“I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War … it was almost impossible for me to sweat,” Andrew claimed.</p>
      <p>The prince did agree an infamous photo of him with his arm around Ms Giuffre – Epstein’s alleged procurer Ghislaine Maxwell in the background – is “definitely” real.</p>
