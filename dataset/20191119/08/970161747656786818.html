      <p>Evidently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pete-davidson/">Pete Davidson</a> and Kaia Gerber are in that stage of relationship where you can’t stay away from one another</p>
      <p>Cute.</p>
      <p>Pete Davidson and Kaia Gerber have only been rumoured to be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> for a hot minute, but right now the heat is well and truly on.</p>
      <p>After the 18-year-old model<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/things-appear-to-be-getting-serious-as-kaia-gerber-personally-delivers-birthday-cake-to-pete-davidson-11170866/"> took a birthday cake to Pete at Saturday Night Live</a> on, er, Saturday night, it seems the couple can’t stay away from one another.</p>
      <p>Yes, workplace visits and all, it appears Pete and Kaia are in that heady period of any relationship where you’re stuck to one another’s side.</p>
      <p>Isn’t young love grand?</p>
      <p>Now the pair are taking in concerts, as they headed to see Charlotte Lawrence perform in New York City on Monday night.</p>

      <p>Wearing the classic model’s outfit of blue, straight-leg jeans, a white crop and jacket, Kaia walked ahead of Pete as he kept his head down.</p>

      <p>Clad in his standard uniform of cap and hoodie pulled over his head, the comedian and actor, 26, attempted to keep a low profile as he walked behind his supposed girlfriend.</p>

      <p>We know it’s you, mate.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, the daughter of Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber kept her beanie-clad head down as she picked up a sweet treat from the famous Magnolia Bakery.</p>
      <p>She was then papped entering the NBC studios (where Pete films Saturday Night Live) later that evening carrying the same bag with her for the birthday boy.</p>
      <p>The pair were later seen arriving back at Kaia’s NYC apartment in the wee hours of the morning after partying for Pete’s big day. Have they spent a day apart recently?</p>

      <p>This latest display of affection comes about after Kaia was seen <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/cindy-crawfords-daughter-kaia-gerber-sports-p-letter-necklace-amid-pete-davidson-dating-rumours-11066449/">wearing a necklace with the letter ‘P’ on it</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>She attended the Women’s Guild Cedars-Sinai Annual Luncheon at the Beverly Wiltshire Hotel while wearing the necklace in question, just weeks after the pair were <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/pete-davidson-sparks-romance-rumours-kaia-gerber-cosy-lunch-date-split-margaret-qualley-10974786/">pictured having a cosy brunch date together</a>.</p>
      <p>Prior to Pete, she had been linked to EastEnders star Patsy Palmer’s son Fenton Markell, and fellow model Wellington Grant.</p>

      <p>Pete famously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/21/pete-davidson-confirms-ariana-grande-engagement-snl-star-admits-won-life-7648601/">got engaged to Ariana Grande in June 2018</a>, before ending their engagement in October that same year.</p>
      <p>More recently, he was dating <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/03/pete-davidson-appears-confirm-romance-margaret-qualley-lovebirds-hold-hands-venice-10675045/">Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star Margaret Qualley</a> following a two-month romance.</p>
      <p>He was also previously linked to Kate Beckinsale, and although the two had a 20-year age gap, they appeared pretty smitten for the most part, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/04/pete-davidson-goes-tongues-kate-beckinsale-confirming-romance-rumours-8800314/">touching tongues at a hockey match</a>.</p>
      <p>Tis all but a memory now.</p>
