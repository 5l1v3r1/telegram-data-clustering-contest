      <h1>Ant Financial Could Pursue Digital Banking License In Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:19:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Ant Financial Services Group might apply for a virtual banking license in Singapore.</p>
      <p>“We are actively looking into this opportunity,” Hangzhou, China-based Ant Financial said in an emailed response to questions from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/ant-financial-may-join-race-for-singapore-virtual-bank-licenses">Bloomberg News</a>.</p>
      <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is offering as many as five digital banking permits to non-banks to boost competition. While Ant didn’t reveal if it would pursue a retail or wholesale license, it will be easier for it to obtain the latter.</p>
      <p>Ant Financial is <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2019/eyeing-ipo-alibaba-gets-go-ahead-to-restructure-ant-financial/">worth</a> around $150 billion, making it one of the most valuable private sector FinTech companies in the world. It also owns the world’s biggest money market fund, Yu’e Bao, and a credit-rating system called Sesame Credit. Ant Financial produced a pre-tax profit in the neighborhood of around $200 million, according to Alibaba’s yearly report.</p>
      <p>China is offering up to two licenses for a full digital bank,  which can serve all customers and require S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in capital and local control. In addition, there will be another three available for wholesale banks, which foreign firms can run and the capital threshold is S$100 million. OCBC, Southeast Asia’s second-largest lender, has already set up a partnership with peer-to-peer lender Validus Capital Pte. and Temasek Holdings Pte’s venture capital arm on a wholesale virtual banking license, reports said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Ant’s SME Services (Hong Kong) Ltd. unit received a permit from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to operate a virtual bank in the Chinese territory. And in March, Ant <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/digital-banking/2019/ant-financial-hoperun-platform-financial-firms/">launched</a> a banking as a service platform with Jiangsu-based Hoperun Information Technology. The companies said the new <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/digital-banking/2019/ant-tencent-xiaomi-hong-kong-digital-banking-license/">banking</a> product dubbed Distributed Core Banking Platform (DCBP) helps financial firms move their business models to customer-oriented models and away from transaction-oriented models. The new banking platform is also designed to help financial firms contend with digital challenges such as distributed development, financial product management and accounting liquidation.</p>
