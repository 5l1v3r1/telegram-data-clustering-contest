        <b>A mum who was trapped with her 11-year-old son in their mangled car after a hit-and-run has appealed for help to identify the callous driver who fled the scene.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sue Williams was driving her boy Josh to their local leisure centre in Longridge when her Vauxhall Corsa was "T-boned" by a vehicle on the Stonebridge Roundabout.</p>

      <p>Firefighters had to release the injured pair and they were both taken to hospital by ambulance.</p>
      <p>Now, as police scour CCTV footage from the scene on Friday evening, Sue has urged witnesses - and even the driver himself - to come forward.</p>
      <p>"The man just drove off," said Sue, who lives in Longridge and works as a teaching assistant.</p>
      <p>"But there's a chance, according to witnesses, that he returned to check we were alright and then drove off again.</p>
      <p>"It was horrendous - especially as there was an 11-year-old child involved."</p>
      <p>The collision happened at around 6.50pm on Friday (November 15).</p>

      <p>As Sue was on the roundabout, she said a car - possibly a dark 4X4 - drove straight out of Kestor Lane and into the side of her vehicle.</p>
      <p>"We had got three-quarters of the way across the roundabout when this car just flew down Kestor Lane, didn't stop and T-boned us," explained Sue.</p>
      <p>"Then it quickly drove away.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a four-by-four, but I can't be sure. It was certainly dark coloured and a witness managed to get part of its number. It started P?19.</p>
      <p>"Some of the people around our car thought he came back, briefly.</p>
      <p>"I remember a guy coming up to my window and saying: 'How are you? Is everything OK?'</p>
      <p>"Then he disappeared again and witnesses said that was him."</p>
      <p>Fire crews released Sue and Josh from the car. At one point they considered cutting the roof off, but firefighters managed to get both casualties out.</p>
      <p>"They thought Josh had a broken arm and a knee injury," said Sue.</p>
      <p>"With me they were going to cut the roof off because I was getting a tingling sensation down my left side.</p>
      <p>"In the end I just had soft tissue injuries and concussion. Everything in my body just hurts.</p>
      <p>"Fortunately Josh just has swelling and bruising, nothing was broken. But he's been traumatised, especially at the thought that someone could do this and then just drive off.</p>
      <p>"If there is anyone out there who saw what happened, or knows who it was, then please contact the police and tell them what you know.</p>
      <p>"As for the driver himself, I'd urge him to examine his conscience and come forward."</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: "We were called around 6.55pm on Friday (November 15) to reports of a collision in Preston Road, Longridge.</p>
      <p>"A Vauxhall Corsa had been involved in a collision with a car, with the driver reported to have made off in the vehicle.</p>
      <p>"The driver of the Corsa, a woman, suffered minor back injuries, with a passenger in the car, an 11-year-old boy, suffering a suspected broken arm.</p>
      <p>"Both were taken to Royal Preston Hospital for treatment."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can contact police on 101 quoting log reference 1312 of November 15.</p>
