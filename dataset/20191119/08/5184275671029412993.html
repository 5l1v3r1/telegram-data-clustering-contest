      <p>John Abraham’s next titled <i>Attack</i> has been in the headlines every now and then since its inception. The actor announced the film earlier this year and later we saw Jacqueline Fernandez join the cast of the film. Today bringing in a new update is that <i>Marjaavaan</i> actress Rakul Preet Singh has also joined the cast and below is all you need to know about the same.</p>
      <p>The film that had Jacqueline cast already turned out to be a two heroine film and will have Rakul Preet Singh as well. If reports in Pinkvilla are to be believed, a source close to the development said, “It’s a two-heroine project. Both the roles are really powerful and action-oriented. The team was scouting for two good looking actors who can also perform and do stunts really well. It’s then that they took the film to Rakul Preet Singh. She was their first choice for the role.”</p>
