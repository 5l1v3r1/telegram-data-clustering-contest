      <p>The commemoration of the International Day for Tolerance in Malang, East Java, saw Buddhist temple Vihara Dharma Mitra Arama hosting an Islamic-themed book discussion centered on Prophet Muhammad.</p>
      <p>The book, titled <i>Muhammadku Sayangku </i>(My Muhammad, My Love), was written by Edi AH Iyubenu.</p>
      <p>During the event, which also featured a Sufi dance performance, participants enjoyed the chanting and singing of <i>sholawat, </i>a religious chant praising the Prophet.</p>
      <p>“I wrote the book with my own style, so that Islam ─ which embodies the principles of love ─ can be understood by the millennial generation,” Edi said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The book discussion was an event promoting pluralism organized by the Gubuk Tulis community, a group that focuses on literacy campaigning.</p>
      <p>The event’s committee leader, Muhammad Yajid Fauzi. said the activity was supported by the Buddhist temple, which provided the event’s venue.</p>
      <p>“This book discussion is to commemorate the International Day for Tolerance, which is celebrated every Nov. 16,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mohammad Mahpur, a psychology lecturer from Malang State University, said that narratives promoted by the book could help the younger generation to better understand Islam.</p>
      <p>“Radicalism is now targeting youngsters who choose the wrong teacher or text, or are influenced by their friends,” Mohammad said, adding that the book and the event were important in promoting tolerance. (gis)</p>
