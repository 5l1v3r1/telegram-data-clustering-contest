      <p>Spotify South Africa is bringing back its holiday three-for-one Premium offer to those who may have jumped music services since the middle of October.</p>
      <p>The company is offering former users three months of Premium access for R59.99. Effectively, you’re getting three months for the price of one.</p>
      <p>The offer is available to those “who have tried Premium before and ended their subscription for whatever reason” after 19 October 2019, the company explained in a release.</p>
      <p>Those who have never tried Spotify before can also still take advantage of <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/08/spotify-premium-free-three-months/">Spotify’s three-month long trial period</a>.</p>
