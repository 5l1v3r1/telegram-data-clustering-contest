      <p>KOTA KINABALU (Nov 19): Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal is aiming to settle the state government's claim for petroleum royalties from the Federal government by next year.</p>
      <p>He said he did not want the issue to drag on until the next General Election.</p>
      <p>"As far as possible, we want to solve it by next year, that is our (the state government's) stand and I don't want to wait too long, because the decline in our finances as tabled in Budget 2020 is for a reason," he said during the Sabah State Assembly Meeting here today.</p>
      <p>He was replying to a supplementary question from Datuk Masidi Manjun (Karanaan-Bersatu), who wished to know the time frame in which the state government would resolve its oil royalty claims from the Federal government.</p>
      <p>Mohd Shafie also dispelled allegations that the state government's efforts to claim the oil royalties were unsuccessful, as out of 21 claims, eight had been agreed upon.</p>
      <p>He said one of them was the increase in special Federal grants from RM26.7 million to RM53.4 million as stipulated in Budget 2020.</p>
      <p>"This has not been done since the 1970s, and never before has the government seen a 100% increase," he said.</p>
      <p>The chief minister also thanked Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad for the setting up of a special Cabinet committee to monitor the progress of the oil royalty claim settlement.</p>
      <p>"The main committee at the Cabinet-level had completed their meeting yesterday, and now, there will be a special council to ensure whatever has been decided is successfully implemented.</p>
      <p>He said Tun Dr Mahathir had also chaired the main committee meeting, which showed his commitment towards resolving the issue.</p>
