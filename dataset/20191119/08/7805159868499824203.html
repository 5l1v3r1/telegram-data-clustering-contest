      <h1>Lenovo ThinkBook 14 and 15 with 10th Gen Intel Comet Lake processors launched in India for SMBs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:25:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/aamirsiddiqui/" target="_blank">Aamir Siddiqui</a></address>
      <p>Lenovo’s presence in the smartphone world may not be as great in current times, despite the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-lenovo-deal-complete/">acquisition of Motorola</a>. However, the situation is quite different when it comes to computing devices beyond smartphones, at least in India. In the country, Lenovo claims to hold the first position in the overall PC market with a 37.7% market share, and a 62.6% share in the commercial notebook market as of H1 2019. The company is now aiming to further extend this lead with the launch of the new Lenovo ThinkBook 14 and Lenovo ThinkBook 15 laptops in India, targeting Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) who are looking to provide the same to a young workforce.</p>
      <p>Lenovo’s SMB Notebook portfolio in India starts off with the V Series 14″ and 15.6″ laptops. In the premium segment, the ThinkPad lineup handles duties at different screen sizes and variations. The ThinkBook lineup slots in between the V series and ThinkPad, augmenting the already <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkbook-series/Lenovo-ThinkBook-13s-IWL/p/88LG8TB1310">existing ThinkBook s series</a> with new entrants in the form of the ThinkBook 14 and 15.</p>

      <p>Lenovo is primarily targeting SMBs with today’s launches, with the idea that the new laptops will serve as worthy tools for the younger workforce, instead of the older and bulkier options from yesteryears. These laptops have a clean, sharp yet understated design language, making them ideal for use within office environments, while still retaining portability for use on the move. Both the laptops can be purchased by end-consumers as well, but the focus is clearly at SMBs and B2B sales, so there is a wide range of configuration options available which the businesses can customize according to their specific needs.</p>

      <h3>Lenovo ThinkBook 14</h3>
      <p>The Lenovo ThinkBook 14 comes with anodized aluminum top and bottom covers (also referred to as A and D covers), while the C cover (where the keyboard rests) features a brushed metal finish on the shell. The display is a 14″ FHD panel with an 80% screen-to-body ratio, and options of IPS or TN panels depending on the model chosen. The laptop also features a 180° lay-flat hinge that allows the laptop to be opened flat, though keep in mind that the display is not a touchscreen and not intended for use as a 2-in-1.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>On the inside, the ThinkBook 14 comes with Intel’s 10th Generation Comet Lake processors, with variants featuring Core i3-10110U, Core i5-10210U, Core i7-10510U or Core i7-10710U chips. Depending on the configuration chosen, you can get a notebook with Integrated Intel UHD graphics, or with AMD Radeon 625 discrete graphics with 2GB DDR5 VRAM. For memory, you can max out the laptop with up to 24GB DDR4 2667MHz RAM, and the company spokespersons mention that one RAM slot is left free inside the laptop for easier upgradability and future-proofing. The notebook can also support a hybrid storage configuration of 1TB M.2 PCIe SSD coupled with 2TB 5400rpm HDD, though you can also opt for a lower SSD storage variant and upgrade it yourself in the future.</p>

      <p>The ThinkBook 14 also comes with a 720p HD camera, with a physical switch that can cover the camera when not needed. Audio duties are handled by stereo speakers on the bottom of the laptop, which are Skype for Business certified. In addition to the I/O ports mentioned in the specification table below, the laptop also features a “hidden” USB 2.0 Type-A port, which is perfect for using a Bluetooth adapter and keeping the port safe from damage during a move.</p>

      <p>Other configuration options include a choice between 45Wh and 57Wh battery, a choice between a rectangle-tip 65W AC adapter or a 65W Type-C adapter. The power button on the laptop can also be optionally upgraded with a fingerprint reader, while the keyboard can optionally gain a backlight. Bluetooth 5 is standard on the laptop, but for WiFi, you can choose from WiFi 5 1x1AC, WiFi 5 2x2AC or WiFi 6 2x2AX. For the OS, you can choose to go for Windows all the way up to Windows 10 Pro, or opt for a DOS laptop.</p>

      <h3>Lenovo ThinkBook 15</h3>
      <p>The Lenovo ThinkBook 15 shares several design characteristics with the ThinkBook 14. But since it has a larger footprint, there is more room, and hence, you also get a bigger keyboard with a dedicated Number Pad.</p>

      <p>The 15’6″ FHD display gives the laptop an 83% screen-to-body ratio. Only the top A cover is aluminum on this size, which helps in managing the weight of the laptop.</p>

      <p>Other changes involve a maxed out variant with AMD Radeon 620 discrete graphics with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM, and a standard inclusion of a Kensington MiniSaver Lock Slot.</p>

      <p>Lenovo claims that the laptop is easy to open, as you can do so by removing the visible screws underneath the laptop. You do not need to remove the rubber stands on the device as there are no hidden screws, so that is always a plus as it makes repairs easier to undertake.</p>

      <h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
      <p>The Lenovo ThinkBook 14 and ThinkBook 15 will be available in India starting 1st week of December 2019 at a starting price of ₹30,990 ($432). While Lenovo did not mention a fixed price for the maxed out variant in their press release, a spokesperson commented that a maxed configuration on this series can set you back in the vicinity of ₹80,000 ($1,115). For context for our international audience, India’s taxation policy often distorts the pricing of similar products in India as against markets like the US, with <a href="https://www.seair.co.in/custom-duty/hs-code-84713010.aspx">an 18% import duty on laptops and computers</a>. So personal computing devices are generally expensive in India for similar hardware.</p>
      <p>While the primary target is SMBs, in which case they should reach out to Lenovo for a specific quote, consumers who are interested in this lineup will also be able to purchase the laptops from Amazon.in and Lenovo.com.</p>
