      <p>Staff at a western suburbs hospital have been urged to walk in groups when leaving work after <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53bti.html">two doctors were assaulted</a> within days of each other after leaving work.</p>
      <p>Sunshine Hospital staff will be able to request escorts to their cars from private security guards following the outbreak of violence.</p>

      <p>On Monday, a registrar had his tooth broken after being kicked in the face and had valuable goods stolen from him, while last Tuesday a junior doctor was walked to his car at knifepoint, the offender then making off with the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating both incidents. The four assailants were described as of African appearance in their late teens to early 20s. It is unclear if the same offenders were involved in both incidents.</p>
      <p>Western Health on Tuesday issued a warning to hospital staff and visitors.</p>

      <p>"Police have advised us to urge you to be aware of your surroundings if you are walking to your vehicle or public transport and not be visibly checking mobile phones whilst walking," it said in a statement posted on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"They have also suggested as a precaution, that staff parking off-site or going to the station should, where possible, walk in groups or obtain lifts from colleagues."</p>
      <p>Western Health officials will meet police on Wednesday to develop a plan to counter the threat of further assaults.</p>
      <p>The state government confirmed on Tuesday that hospital staff would be able to request private security guards to escort them to their cars.</p>
      <p>Police patrols around the hospital will be increased.</p>
      <p>Australian Medical Association Victoria president Julian Rait expressed disappointment at the hospital's response to the attacks, accusing it of being "complacent".</p>

      <p>"Western Health have been very duplicitous in a way, because they've been all words and no action," he said. "It's only taken this second incident for them to actually be doing something about it."</p>
      <p>Hospital chief executive Russell Harrison said the staff member was being supported by colleagues and family.</p>
      <p>"We are extremely concerned that these assaults have occurred and the safety of Western Health staff and volunteers is our top priority," Mr Harrison said in a statement.</p>
      <p>A Victorian government spokeswoman said Health Minister Jenny Mikakos "directed her department to ensure impacted staff are receiving every possible support from Western Health".</p>
      <p>The attacks come months after<i> The Age</i> reported <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52cgr.html">junior doctors at Sunshine Hospital had launched legal action</a>, claiming they were working beyond exhaustion, underpaid and not given mandatory clinical training.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Andrews government introduced new laws aimed at toughening the sentencing of anyone found guilty of assaulting an emergency worker.</p>
      <p>Both recent assaults, however, occurred while workers were off duty and off-site.</p>
      <p>Doctors and nurses are regularly victims of violence within hospitals. There were 240 occupational violence incidents reported in all of Western Health, the 2016-17 annual report said.</p>
      <p>Almost 11 per cent of those incidents resulted in a staff injury or illness. There were 13 accepted WorkCover claims from Sunshine Hospital in 2016-17.</p>
