        <b>A Liverpool attacking target has fuelled talk of a potential Anfield switch, while Tottenham could turn to Germany for Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement, according to Tuesday’s newspapers.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>LIVERPOOL ATTACKING TARGET FUELS TALK OF MOVE</h3>
      <p>Liverpool transfer target Ryan Fraser has fuelled reports that he could be on his way to Liverpool in 2020.</p>
      <p>Fraser joined the Cherries from Aberdeen in January 2013 and is the fourth longest-serving player at the club.</p>
      <p>However, the 25-year-old has stalled on a contract extension this year and is set to leave Bournemouth when his contract expires in June.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/report-clarifies-klopps-stance-as-dynamic-duo-linked-with-liverpool-move"><b>known to be one of a number of the clubs monitoring the Scot’s situation</b></a>, alongside Arsenal.</p>
      <p>And both clubs will have been encouraged in their pursuit of the player following a recent interview he gave with the <i>Daily Echo, </i>which suggested he was unsettled on the South Coast.</p>
      <p>Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is looking to strengthen a forward line that already includes dynamic trio Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>But with Xherdan Shaqiri and Adam Lallana both being tipped to move on in the search for regular first-team football, Liverpool will be in need for new recruits and Fraser’s direct attacking style certainly fits the Merseyside club’s profile.</p>
