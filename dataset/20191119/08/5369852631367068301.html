      <p>PATRICK MAHOMES AND the Kansas City Chiefs took advantage of an error-strewn Los Angeles Chargers display to claim a 24-17 victory in Mexico City on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mahomes overcame a sluggish start and a slippery surface at the Azteca Stadium as the Chiefs maintained their place atop the AFC West at 7-4.</p>
      <p>The Chargers meanwhile were left ruing another uneven display from veteran quarterback Philip Rivers, who threw four interceptions after tossing three picks in his previous outing.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old’s night ended on a miserable note as the Chargers chased a game-tying touchdown in the dying seconds.</p>
      <p>After marching the Chargers upfield on a 77-yard drive inside the final two minutes, Rivers lofted a pass deep into the end zone intended for running back Austin Ekeler with 18 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Chiefs safety Daniel Sorensen read the play however and darted in to snatch the interception, sealing victory for Andy Reid’s side.</p>
      <p>Rivers slumped to the turf in despair as the Chargers digested their seventh defeat of the season — all of them coming by margins of one score or less.</p>
      <p>Rivers finished with 353 passing yards from 28 completions — almost double the 182 yards accumulated by opposite number Mahomes.</p>
      <p>However while it was far from a vintage display from reigning NFL MVP Mahomes, the Chiefs quarterback converted crucial scoring opportunities when they arose.</p>
      <p>Mahomes finished the first half with just 63 passing yards against Rivers’ 237, yet somehow had managed to shepherd the Chiefs into a 10-9 half-time lead in front of 76,000 fans.</p>
      <p>Although much had been made beforehand of Mahomes long-range passing ability in the thin air of Mexico City, the Chiefs quarterback surprisingly excelled with the ball in hand. Mahomes rushed for 59 yards from five carries.</p>
      <p>The decisive period came early in the third quarter, when Mahomes led the Chiefs on a nine-play 75-yard drive which culminated in a six-yard run from Darrel Williams for the touchdown to put Kansas City 17-9 ahead.</p>
      <p>Mahomes then found tight end Travis Kelce with a 23-yard pass for the Chiefs’ third touchdown and a 24-9 lead.</p>
      <p>The Chargers rallied with Rivers finding Keenan Allen with a seven-yard pass for a touchdown, followed by a successful two-point conversion.</p>

      <p>But the Chargers’ hopes of a comeback ended with Rivers fourth interception of the game on the final drive.</p>
