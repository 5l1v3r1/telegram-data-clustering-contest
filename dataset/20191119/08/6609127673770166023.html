        <b>CELTIC are keen on extending Daniel Arzani's loan deal from Man City, according to reports.</b>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> are reported to be interested in keeping the young winger for a further season despite his lack of first-team action.</p>

      <p>Australian football website <a href="https://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/vote-of-confidence-for-arzani-as-celtic-bid-to-extend-loan-deal">The World Game</a> claim Hoops boss Neil Lennon wants the 20-year-old to stay on at Celtic.</p>
      <p>Discussions are reported to be in the early stages but it's claimed Arzani would be interested in another season in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Arzani last played for the Hoops first-team against Dundee 13 months ago.</p>
      <p>He has only managed training and the rare reserve outing ever since suffering a tear to his ACL on his debut.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4969237/swansea-stoke-city-celtic-jonny-hayes-parkhead/">Swansea are set to make a move for Jonny Hayes</a>.</p>
      <p>Championship rivals Stoke City are also eyeing a move for the Ireland international.</p>
      <p>Hayes' current contract is set to run out in the summer with clubs beginning to circle.</p>
      <p>But Celtic don't want to lose the utility player and want him to commit his future to Parkhead.</p>
