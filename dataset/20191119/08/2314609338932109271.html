      <h1>Taxpayers to stump up cash for Housing Authority investigation</h1>

      <p>Taxpayers will be forced to stump up fees for the Public Sector Commission to bring in third-party auditors and experts for its review of the Housing Authority in the wake of the biggest alleged corruption scandal WA has ever seen.</p>
      <p>After news broke of Housing Authority assistant director general Paul Whyte's <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53b0l.html">alleged multi-million dollar false invoicing scheme</a> on Friday, Premier Mark McGowan ordered the PSC to conduct an investigation into the government agency.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, Public Sector Commissioner Sharyn O’Neill, who has oversight over the public sector, said the commission would have to bring in financial experts to help with its review.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately we may have to spend more to get to the bottom of it but I think that investment will be needed in order to make sure the right controls are in place going forward," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms O'Neill said while the scope of the investigation was still to be determined it would look at the gaps in auditing and other controls that allowed the alleged corruption continue for so long.</p>
      <p>"The review looks at governance, it looks at administration and trying to understand how is it that this alleged corruption could go on for this period of time," she said.</p>
      <p>"What are the gaps in processes and policies and importantly in the culture of that organisation that enabled this to occur.</p>
      <p>"We want to learn from that for the whole sector but particularly for any future iteration of the housing authority and the Department of Communities."</p>
      <p>When asked about financial controls at the authority that allowed one man to have so much procurement power, Ms O'Neill said there should never be just one person who has the capacity to both incur and authorise expenditure.</p>

      <p>"That's just not good practice, it's not what we expect and certainly that is something we will look at in this review," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms O'Neill did not reveal how long the review would take but that it would be presented to the Premier who would make the call whether it would be made public, which she said she understood was his intention.</p>
      <p>She said in her 15 months in the role she had not received any reports of corruption at the Housing Authority.</p>
      <p>"I've had some look at some historical information but there is nothing to suggest any allegation of corruption at the Housing Authority that we have record of here at the PSC," she said.</p>
