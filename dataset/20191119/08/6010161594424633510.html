      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order PC patch fixes longer than expected load times</h1>

      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order’s first patch is here.</p>
      <p>Respawn has released the first post-launch update for <b>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</b>. Available only on PC for now, a similar patch will soon arrive on PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
      <p>This initial update isn’t massive, so don’t expect major fixes to the biggest-ticket items. The most interesting patch note in this one is a fix to address a problem that would sometimes cause slowdowns and extended loading times.</p>
      <p>The dynamic resolution option, which some noted can be inconsistent, was apparently turning itself off. The update should make whatever setting you picked for it stick.</p>
