      <p>NEW DELHI: It's a twin blow for Indian archers preparing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The suspension of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Archery-Association-of-India">Archery Association of India</a> (AAI) by the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Archery">World Archery</a> (WA) has again robbed the country's archers of a chance to compete at an upcoming Olympic qualifying event under the 'Indian flag'.</p>
      <p>Besides, the archers have faces another embarrassment at the regional front after the South Asian Archery Federation (SAAF), during its recent meeting in Dhaka, resolved not to permit the Indian archers to participate at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/South-Asian-Games">South Asian Games</a> (SAG) in Nepal from December 1 to 10.</p>
      <p>Talking about Indian archers being stopped from competing at the SAG, the SAAF recorded in its minutes of the meeting "Indian archery association has already been suspended by the World Archery from participation in all international and regional tournaments. The SAAF Board decided to adhere to the directive given by the World Archery in participation of archers of India in any competitions registered under World Archery. The Board has unanimously decided not to permit the archers of AAI in the forthcoming 13th South Asian Games to be held in Nepal as the members of World Archery are compelled to adhere to the guidelines given by World Archery."</p>
      <p>The minutes of the meeting are in possession of the TOI. The decision by the SAAF has already been communicated to both the Indian government and the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-Olympic-Association">Indian Olympic Association</a> (IOA).</p>
      <p>The archers have further reasons to worry about, especially the women's recurve archers who are yet to qualify for Tokyo Olympics. In another embarrassment, both the men and women recurve archers will compete at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Asian-Archery-Championships">Asian Archery Championships</a>, starting in Bangkok from coming Thursday under the 'World Archery flag' due to the AAI's suspension. The tournament is a qualifying event in individual category for Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>As a result, the medals won by the country's archers will be counted towards the World Archery tally and not as an Indian medal. This will be the second such instance in as many months where the archers have been forced to compete under the World Archery flag.</p>
      <p>Only last month at the Asian Para Archery Championships, India's Vivek Chikara did the entire nation proud by winning a gold medal in the men's recurve open event with an impressive 7-1 win over China's Sijun Wang, but he, along with other Indian para archers, had to compete under the World Archery flag and his Olympic quota place for the Tokyo <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Paralympic-Games">Paralympic Games</a> wasn't counted for India.</p>
      <p>In the latest development, if the Indian women recurve archers were able to win a medal and a subsequent individual quota place at the forthcoming Asian Archery Championships, it will counted as World Archery medals and quota place. The team event for women recurve archers will take place next year somewhere in May-June in Germany. The men's recurve archers (three quota places) had qualified for the Tokyo Games earlier this year after their impressive performance at the World Championships in The Netherlands.</p>
