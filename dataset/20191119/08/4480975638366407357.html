      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">Gold</a> failed to capitalize on the Asian session uptick to two-week tops and is currently placed near the lower end of its daily trading range, around the $1470 region.<br/> <br/>The precious metal initially built on the overnight goodish intraday bounce from three-day lows and gained some follow-through traction on Tuesday amid receding hopes for a preliminary US-China trade deal.</p>
      <h3>US-China trade developments driving gold</h3>
      <p>Given the US President Donald Trump's reluctance to roll back tariffs, CNBC reported on Monday that Chinese officials are pessimistic that a trade deal will be signed and boosted demand for traditional safe-haven assets.<br/> <br/>The precious metal rallied over 1% from daily lows, albeit struggled to capitalize on the momentum and once again failed near a one-month-old trading range support breakpoint, now turned <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> around the $1475 region.<br/> <br/>Some signs of stability in the global equity markets, reinforced by a modest uptick in the US Treasury bond yields turned out to be one of the key factors exerting some downward pressure on the non-yielding yellow metal.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, the intraday pullback seemed limited and is likely to remain cushioned amid a subdued US dollar demand, which tends to underpin demand for dollar-denominated commodities – like gold.<br/> <br/>Moving ahead, Tuesday's US economic docket, highlighting the release of housing market data, coupled with speeches by influential <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> members will now be looked upon to grab some short-term trading opportunities.</p>
