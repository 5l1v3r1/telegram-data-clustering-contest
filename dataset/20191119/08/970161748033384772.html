      <p>A woman has been left devastated after severe and quick-spreading psoriasis covered her entire body and turned the rose tattoo on her arm into an ‘unrecognisable, blurry mess.’</p>
      <p>When Kelly O’Hanlon, 35, first noticed her scalp was itchy and flaky, she thought it was simply dandruff, so she started using a specialist shampoo.</p>
      <p>But when that made little difference, she saw her GP and was diagnosed with psoriasis – an incurable condition which sees the skin become covered in crusty patches.</p>

      <p>Over the next few years, Kelly – who has two children – tried all sorts of treatments, including topical creams and UVB light therapy, but nothing controlled the condition for long.</p>

      <p>‘I went from having a patch of psoriasis the size of a 50p to my legs, arms, stomach and even face being covered in red, sore patches,’ says Kelly.</p>
      <p>‘The tattoo on my arm, which I got in 2017 and have always loved, was particularly affected. One day it was there, and the next it had disappeared into a blurred, distorted mess.’</p>
      <p>The initial patch on Kelly’s scalp began to get grow and get incredibly itchy, but Kelly admits she never expected the condition to spread as quickly as it did.</p>
      <p>Over the next three months, Kelly’s symptoms worsened until her hairline and the skin behind her ears were also covered in crusty patches.</p>
      <p>In September 2011, she was officially diagnosed with plaque psoriasis – the most common form of the condition – and given some prescription-strength coal tar shampoo.</p>
      <p>For the next 18 months, she did her best to manage to condition.</p>
      <p>‘No one could see it at that point, because it was only on my scalp and the surrounding areas,’ she explains. ‘But because I knew it was there, I was constantly checking on it – itching and scratching to see how flaky I was. I became fixated, which added to my stress and anxiety.’</p>
      <p>After giving birth to Ethan in May 2013, Kelly’s psoriasis ‘exploded’ across her body.</p>

      <p>‘I noticed a minute patch of dry skin on my baby bump towards the end of the pregnancy but I wasn’t too bothered,’ she says.</p>

      <p>‘Fast forward to three months later though, and both my legs were covered in sheets of psoriasis.’</p>
      <p>According to the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Alliance, between and 10 and 20 per cent of women find that their psoriasis gets worse during pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Her doctor told her the outbreak was likely linked to hormonal changes. She was then prescribed steroid cream and referred for a 10-week course of light therapy.</p>
      <p>‘I had to go religiously three times a week for short bursts of light therapy, but because my skin is so fair it started off with a very low dosage,’ she says.</p>
      <p>‘By the time I’d finished, it had cleared up most of the psoriasis on my upper half, and my legs had improved a lot.’</p>
      <p>Finally able to enjoy motherhood without feeling self-conscious, Kelly went five months without a flare-up – but her psoriasis returned in 2014.</p>

      <p>‘The psoriasis came back with a vengeance and after initially trying light therapy again, I just thought the benefits weren’t worth it,’ she adds.</p>
      <p>‘I had already undergone 30 sessions of light therapy and you’re only allowed so many in your life due to the risk of skin damage.</p>
      <p>‘The whole process was a juggling act and it wasn’t giving me the results I wanted the second time around.’</p>
      <p>Sadly, Kelly’s confidence was soon at rock bottom – not least because of the stares and comments she faced from strangers.</p>
      <p>‘I took the children out swimming and I was in my costume – something which takes a lot of courage, even on a good day – and the child behind asked his mum what was wrong with my legs.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I realise children don’t understand the impact their words have, but I couldn’t help feeling torn up by it all.’</p>
      <p>When Kelly fell pregnant for the second time last year, a dermatologist recommend she try Epaderm emollient ointment as an alternative to steroid cream, which she was worried about using as an expectant mother.</p>
      <p>According to the NHS, whilst most topical cortisteroids are considered safe to use during pregnancy, particularly potent ones are not usually prescribed.</p>

      <p>‘During the pregnancy, the hormones this time around seemed to have a positive effect on the psoriasis – my skin cleared up for a good few months,’ she says.</p>
      <p>‘Then after I gave birth in December, it all came back thicker than ever – my skin felt like it was on fire.</p>
      <p>‘I just thought, “I can’t live like this.” It really was the worst it’s ever been.’</p>
      <p>Kelly decided to start using Epaderm religiously, day and night – and within a matter of weeks, she said her skin was showing signs of improvement.</p>
      <p>‘Now I use it morning and night, I even carry a little tube in my handbag,’ she says.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t want it to come across like this cured my psoriasis, because it’s not something you can ever really cure, but it’s about finding what works for you.</p>

      <p>‘Now, for the first time in a long time, I feel back in control, and I want to show others out there living with psoriasis that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.’</p>
