      <h1>Spec Comparo: Royal Enfield Classic 350 vs Jawa Perak</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:37:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:37</time> by <a rel="author">Aditya Jadhav  </a></address>
      <p>Jawa launched the Perak in India at an ex-showroom cost of Rs 1.94 lakh ex-showroom which makes it the most affordable Bobber in the country today. Soon enough, Royal Enfield followed with a new 'Make Your Own' campaign that allows its customers to accessorise the Classic 350 while keeping the warranty safeguarded. To suit more in line as a lifestyle product, the Classic 350 can be had as a single-seat motorcycle under the 'Make Your Own' campaign which only highlights the rivalry between the two. That said, before we get our hands on the two for a comparative review, here is a specification comparison of the Jawa Perak and the Classic 350.</p>

        <b>Engine and drivetrain</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Classic 350 has the upper hand here with a single-cylinder displacing 346cc. The engine uses air-cooling for heat management. On the flip side, the Perak has 334cc of displacement but gets liquid-cooling for heat dissipation. Between the two, the Perak is a BSVI compliant motorcycle while the Classic 350 still complies with the BSIV norms. The Classic gets a 5-speed gearbox while the Perak benefits from the sixth cog (6-speed gearbox).</p>
