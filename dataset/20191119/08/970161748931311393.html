      <p>In the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a> films, it was all about Ron and Hermione when it came to us shipping the Hogwarts lot.</p>
      <p>But according to Rupert Grint, Ms Granger was more involved with a certain Slytherin than she was her best mate.</p>
      <p>Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the franchise, has claimed that there was a ‘spark’ between co-stars Emma Watson and Tom Felton on set – and our inner Potterheads are screaming.</p>
      <p>Emma, 29, and Tom, 32 – who played Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter respectively – have remained close since the franchise ended, and have shared a number of pictures together on social media, including one in August where <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/19/emma-watson-tom-felton-reunite-guitar-lesson-harry-potter-fans-losing-minds-10597833/">Tom gave his friend a guitar lesson in South Africa.</a></p>
      <p>And their former co-star has landed them in it by claiming there was a ‘playground romance’ between them in their teens.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.etonline.com/rupert-grint-says-he-always-saw-sparks-between-emma-watson-and-tom-felton-exclusive-136582">Speaking to Entertainment Tonight,</a> Rupert, 31, said that he didn’t want to stir up any rumours… after he stirred up the rumours with a big ol’ wooden spoon in a cauldron.</p>

      <p>When asked if he could ever see Emma and Tom together, the actor – who is starring in M Night Shyamalan’s new Apple TV+ series The Servant – said: ‘Yeah I could.</p>
      <p>‘There was always something. There was a little bit of a spark.’</p>
      <p>Grint, who is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/22/rupert-grint-sparks-wedding-rumours-pictured-rare-outing-girlfriend-georgia-groome-9284285/">in a relationship with Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging actress Georgia Groome</a>, added: ‘But we were kids. It was like any kind of playground romance’; also quipping that he himself was ‘spark-free’.</p>
      <p>This comes after Tom praised <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/emma-watson-not-single-self-partnered-11043290/">Emma’s newly coined term ‘self-partnered’</a>, after the Little Women actress rebranded her single status.</p>

      <p>Felton told Mail Online: ‘I’m in the same category, to be honest with you, quite happily self-partnered.’</p>
      <p>However, he raised speculation that he could be ditching that label soon enough, as he went on to heap praise on the actress.</p>
      <p>Tom – who split from long-term girlfriend Jade Gordon in 2016 – said: ‘It’s always nice to bump into her, see her at the beach, or over dinner or whatever.</p>
      <p>‘She’s an incredibly smart and lovely young lady, so it’s always nice to bump into each other and slightly reminisce about old times but also about looking forward to the future.’</p>

      <p>While the actors may just be close friends, Emma previously admitted to fancying the actor when they were younger.</p>
      <p>Speaking on The Jonathan Ross Show back in 2012, the activist said: ‘Between the ages of 10 and 12, I had a really terrible crush on Tom Felton.</p>
      <p>‘We love a bad guy and he was a few years older and he had a skateboard. And that just did it, really. He used to do tricks on it. He was so cool.’</p>
