        <b>Late last week, Donald Trump visited the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in Bethesda, Maryland, where he reportedly underwent an unscheduled medical checkup , tweeting shortly afteward that “everything is very good”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a memorandum released on Monday, Sean Conley, Donald Trump's personal physician, stated that the US President’s visit to Walter Reed National Military Center last week was a “routine” physical exam. </p>
      <blockquote>“This past Saturday afternoon the President travelled up to Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre for a routine, planned interim checkup as part of the regular, primary preventative care he receives throughout the year. Due to scheduling uncertainties, the trip was kept off the record,” Conley pointed out.</blockquote>
      <p>He added that “despite some of the speculation, the President has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues.”</p>

      <blockquote>“Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations [during the exam]”, Conley noted.</blockquote>
      <p>The memorandum comes after CNN cited an unnamed source as saying that Trump's Saturday visit to Walter Reed was allegedly out of line with the protocol of a routine presidential medical exam.</p>
      <p>The source claimed that Walter Reed’s medical staff was not notified about a “VIP” visit ahead of Trump’s arrival, which indicates that the US President’s visit was non-routine.</p>
      <h3>Trump Tweets His Health ‘Great’</h3>
      <blockquote>On Sunday, Trump went on Twitter to announce that he “began phase one of my yearly physical at the amazing Walter Reed Medical Center” and that “everything [is] very good (great!)”.</blockquote>

      <p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, in turn, said that “anticipating a very busy 2020”, Trump had decided to take advantage of a free weekend to begin his annual physical exam at Walter Reed.</p>
      <blockquote>“He’s healthy as can be. He has more energy than anybody in the White House. That man works from 6 a.m. until very, very late at night,” she told Fox News.</blockquote>
      <p>Trump's visit to Walter Reed comes amid <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911181077341206-trump-says-considering-idea-of-testifying-at-democrats-phony-impeachment-witch-hunt/">the ongoing impeachment inquiry against him,</a> which was initiated by House Democrats in September.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Washington Examiner reported that a group of medics plan to testify during House impeachment proceedings, claiming that Trump's mental health makes him dangerous and unfit for presidential office.</p>
      <p>Back in February, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201902151072433438-trump-white-house-physical-details/">after conducting a physical examination of Trump,</a> his physician Sean Conley concluded that the US President is in "very good health".</p>
