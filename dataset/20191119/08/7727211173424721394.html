      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:01:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Scarlett Moffatt has been dropped from her co-presenting role on Saturday Night Takeaway.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old landed the job in 2017 and said it was her "dream" to be working alongside <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec">Ant &amp; Dec.</a></p>
      <p>However, she will not be reprising the role when the show returns next year.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> spokesman said: "Scarlett Moffatt won't feature as a contributor in the 2020 series of Saturday Night Takeaway.</p>
      <p>"We thank Scarlett for all of her hard work on the show and will announce details of the new series nearer transmission."</p>

      <p>An ITV source <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/scarlett-moffatt-dropped-dream-job-20910092">told The Mirror:</a> "Show bosses are planning lots of new and exciting features for the 2020 series alongside the return of viewer favourites.</p>
      <p>"Scarlett Moffatt won’t feature in the new series but she’s not being replaced. It will be just Ant and Dec and Stephen Mulhern who will return to host Ant vs Dec.</p>
      <p>"Scarlett did a great job on the series and we thank her for all her hard work but sadly the new series doesn’t have room for her on screen role."</p>
      <p>Moffatt, who is from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, is close friends with Geordie stars Ant &amp; Dec.</p>
      <p>She rose to fame after appearing on Gogglebox and won the 16th series of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2016.</p>
      <p>Moffatt recently appeared in Channel 4 documentary The British Tribe Next Door</p>
