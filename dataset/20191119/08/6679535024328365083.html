      <p>An aggrieved farmer on Tuesday attempted to set ablaze the computers and files in the Chigurumamidi Tahsildar office in Karimnagar district alleging that officials were not redressing the land dispute.</p>
      <p>Kankaiah, a resident of Lambadipalli, carrying a petrol can barged into the office on Tuesday morning, tried to set ablaze computers and files. Alert office staff – Rajanna, Anitha, Divya and Chander – pushed the farmer and in the process the petrol fell on them.</p>
      <p>The farmer was overpowered by the staff and confined to a room. On information, police rushed to the office and took Kankaiah into custody.</p>
      <p>Revenue officials said there was no delay on the part of the department to redress his grievance. “There is a dispute between the brothers on land issue and we have no role in it,” they maintained.</p>
      <p>The incident comes barely two weeks after <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/woman-tahsildar-burnt-alive-inside-office-in-telanganas-abdullapurmet/article29879964.ece">Vijaya Reddy</a>, the Abdullapurmet Tahsildar was burnt alive by a farmer who was aggrieved that his land was not being registered in his name. Subsequently, the accused Suresh and Guruntham, driver of the Tahsildar Vijaya Reddy too succumbed to the burn injuries.</p>
      <p>The incident led to the police stepping up vigil at the revenue offices across Telangana. Monday, which happens to be the Grievance Day in all offices saw police personnel standing guard outside and screening every visitor.</p>
