      <p>Nottingham Forest make the trip to Ashton Gate on Saturday looking to make it three wins on the spin.</p>
      <p>It will be two weeks since their last game by the time they kick off against Bristol City, but Sabri Lamouchi’s men will be hoping to carry the momentum from the win over Derby last time out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> start the game above this weekend’s opponents on goal difference alone, with both sides sat on 28 points, although the Reds do have a game in hand.</p>

      <p>But Lee Johnson’s men go into the game with their injury worries easing.</p>
      <p>The Robins also beat their close rivals before the international break, beating Cardiff City in South Wales. And that win also saw Adam Nagy make his return to the first team as Johnson’s squad continues to return to health.</p>

        <b>Korey Smith</b>
      </p>
      <p>The midfielder has been a long term absentee for City, but could be set to return for this weekend after playing 70 minutes in a development game against Cardiff last week.</p>
      <p>"I was just buzzing to get out there. It would have been nice to get the win but we played some really good stuff and maybe should have played a few more goals in the second half," <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/korey-smith-buzzing-dressing-room-3526983"><b>he said following the game</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"By the second half the pitch cut up and we gave away a sloppy goal early in the second half and it ended in a draw. For me on a personal note I was just happy to be back out there and get the boots back on and play football.</p>
      <p>"I haven't made my full comeback yet but a big shout-out to the medical staff after two major injuries and three or four operations - they've put so much into it and I appreciate every single one of them. Hopefully I can get back out there and can repay them," he said, adding that Lee Johnson will decide when he is fit to return, with Nottingham Forest up next.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jack Hunt</b>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly to Smith, Hunt is set to return against Lamouchi’s charges this weekend, according to Johnson.</p>

      <p>The former Forest loanee suffered a hamstring issue, but he is expected to be in contention against Forest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Definitely missing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jay Dasilva (broken leg) and Benik Afobe (ACL) are both out for the foreseeable future, a pair of injury blows which could derail City’s promotion push in the coming months.</p>
