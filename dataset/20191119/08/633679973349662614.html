      <p>A Facebook administrator who landed in hot water for a <a href="https://www.algoafm.co.za/article/local/102773/fb-administrators-given-last-chance-to-apologise-or-face-consequences-">controversial Facebook Page</a> where a grieving father was defamed has stepped up and apologised.</p>
      <p>The page "Murder she wrote investigations and discussions" where the death of Heidi Scheepers and her two children was discussed at length, published an apology on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Ettienne Scheepers who is the husband of Heidi Scheepers, claims through his attorneys, A Chimes van Wyk, that the comments and discussions on the page were nothing more than a platform where he is being grossly defamed and which has caused and continues to cause him grave reputational harm as well as to his business interests.</p>
      <p>Some of the discussions on the Facebook page accused Scheepers of killing his wife, plotting her murder, having an affair and driving his wife to suicide.</p>
      <p>Heidi and her two children were killed in October when their VW Caravelle was found partially submerged in the ocean at the bottom of a 100-meter high cliff at Voëlklip.</p>
      <p>The bodies of Hugo and Heidi were found soon after the wreckage was spotted and an autopsy revealed that both had died as a result of drowning.</p>
      <p>The body of their six-year-old daughter was never found and the search has since been called off.</p>
      <p>Even though the apology was published after the cut off time and not the exact words that were requested, it was accepted by Mr. Scheepers.</p>
      <p>A Consultant Attorney at Chimes van Wyk Donald Curtis says the apology is accepted and therefore, at this stage, no further legal steps will be taken.</p>
      <p>The page which was run by three administrators is now only run by one single founding member, who issued an apology in her own words.</p>
      <p>Two other administrators, Chantal Strydom Dobson and Diane van Rensburg have since been removed from the page and are no longer active participants.</p>
      <p>Algoa FM News has learned that their removal as administrators  does not allow them to avoid liability or create a legal defense regarding this particular matter in future. </p>
      <p>According to a legal expert, courts will look at who the admins were during the relevant time period of the posts, should legal steps be taken in the future.</p>
      <p>Here is the apology posted by the founder of the page:</p>
