      <h1>Football rumours: Julian Nagelsmann to replace Pochettino at Spurs?</h1>

        <i>Today’s fluff is running the gauntlet</i>
      </p>
      <p>In news that could have been written at any given point in the past 15 years, Arsenal need defensive reinforcements. Consequently, the Gunners are training their sights on <b>Villarreal’s Pau Torres</b>. The 22-year-old centre-back, who made his Spain debut last month, is admittedly weighed down by a £43m release clause, but Unai Emery is undeterred, according to The Sun. However, they may face competition from Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Emery is not the only manager in north London subject to whispers of uncertainty. The Times says Tottenham are thought to be making eyes at Leipzig’s <b>Julian Nagelsmann</b> as a potential replacement for Mauricio Pochettino, who is in talks with the chairman, Daniel Levy, about his future, reports the Telegraph.</p>
      <p>Another Spurs employee possibly heading away from their swanky stadium is <b>Victor Wanyama</b>, who could be heading back to <b>Celtic</b> on what would initially be a loan deal. Though heading out the door at Parkhead might be the winger <b>Jonny Hayes</b>, in whom <b>Huddersfield</b> are interested.</p>
      <p>And to complete a hat-trick of London-based managerial uncertainty stories, West Ham are pondering luring <b>Rafa Benítez</b> back to the Premier League if they decide to get rid of Manuel Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>Another day, another <b>Erling Braut Håland</b> tidbit. The Salzburg striker’s dad, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/06/roy-keane-alf-inge-haaland-book">Roy Keane’s old mate Alf Inge</a>, has visited Manchester United’s training ground, heightening already dizzy speculation that the 19-year-old striker might be Old Trafford-bound in the near future.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere,<b> Wolves </b>reportedly want the <b>Royal Antwerp right-back</b> <b>Aurelio Buta</b> on loan in January,<b> Chelsea</b> are looking at Genk’s Norway midfielder <b>Sander Berg</b> and <b>Chris Smalling</b> is suddenly a man in demand, with Juventus and Internazionale both keen on the defender, currently on loan at Roma from Manchester United.</p>
