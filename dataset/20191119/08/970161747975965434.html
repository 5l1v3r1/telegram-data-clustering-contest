      <p>Piers Morgan wasn’t happy to hear that Instagram could be about to remove likes from its platform and claimed that the move will ‘trigger his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anxiety/">anxiety</a>’.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain host grilled Facebook executive Nicola Mendelsohn over the potential initiative on today’s programme and pointed out that he’ll no longer be able to compare his popularity to The Apprentice’s Lord Alan Sugar.</p>
      <p>‘Are you taking away my likes?’ Piers asked Nicola.</p>
      <p>‘Well we might do, Piers,’ his guest replied.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t want you to!’ Piers snapped. ‘Why? Why take the fun away? Just because a bunch of people who were weaned at school and now get participation prizes because they can’t deal with losing… that’s what it really boils down to.’</p>

      <p>Nicola went on to explain: ‘We want people, when they come on our platform, to actually be enjoying the stuff that they’re doing.</p>
      <p>‘They should be interacting, commenting, sharing… those things matter. People scrolling endlessly is not a good experience.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘We do things to make sure people are seeing the things from their family, from their friends, maybe from the broadcasters that they like.’</p>
      <p>Piers, however, insisted that Instagram scrapping likes will take the fun out of the platform.</p>
      <p>‘My pictures get more likes than Lord Sugar’s and you’re going to take that pleasure away from me,’ the host continued.</p>
      <p>‘You’re going to trigger my own anxiety about not knowing how more popular [I am] than Lord Sugar.’</p>
      <p>Viewers, like Piers, weren’t pleased to hear about the overhaul and ranted about the decision on Twitter, with one writing: ‘If likes are no longer available on Instagram, users will migrate to another photo app that allows likes.’</p>

      <p>Echoing a similar sentiment, another added: ‘If you take away the likes people will stop using Instagram… SIMPLE.’</p>
