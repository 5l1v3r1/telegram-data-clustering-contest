      <h1>All The ‘Sims’ Games Ranked By How Horny Their Respective WooHoo Functions Were</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:47:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:47</time> by <a rel="author">By Louis Hanson</a></address>
      <p>Woohoo-ing is fun, particularly when you’re a horny, hormonal pubescent in the midst of a 4-day <i>Sims</i> bender and the only way you can alleviate said horniness is by projecting all your frustrations out on a couple of unsuspecting Sims.</p>
      <p>From 2000’s <i>The Sims</i> to <i>Sims 4</i>, we’ve witnessed an incredible evolution in Sim fucking. But when considering each instalment’s woohoo-ing capabilities, how do they stack up against each other? Which <i>Sims</i> game embodies sexual enlightenment? Conversely, which one tries its damndest but ultimately gives a, well, <i>flaccid</i> effort?</p>
      <p>I tasked myself with the great responsibility to rank the <i>Sims</i> games by how horny their woohoo-ing is. It’s time to jump in the sack, you horny cyber-devils.</p>
      <h3>4TH PLACE – SIMS 3</h3>
      <p>Don’t get me wrong: I love <i>Sims 3</i>, it’s probably my favourite out of the various instalments. But when considering its woohoo-ing capabilities, and woohoo-ing capabilities alone, the seks was… dare I say… rather bland? Yes, the hand holding at the start was cute, and yes, the violins were sonically pleasing, and sure, the petals were a vision, but where were the damn fireworks (literally and symbolically)? Given its predecessors – more on that later – it simply wasn’t as raunchy, and this left me a sad, horny user.</p>
      <h3>3RD PLACE – SIMS</h3>
      <p>Three words: Vibromatic Heart Bed. The sleezy bed was introduced as part of the <i>The Sims: Livin’ Large </i>expansion pack, allowing our precious, sexually-frustrated Sims to get it on and ‘play’.</p>
      <p>The ‘vibrate’ and ‘play’ functions in the love bed – which now looks super fucking tacky – created a sleazy motel vibe, but who doesn’t love the odd stale motel romper session? Actually, on second thoughts, we love a naughty motel romper session. Kudos to you, Vibromatic Heart Bed.</p>
      <p>The function itself was also admirable – computer game fucking was unprecedented in 2000, so <i>Sims</i> was a pioneer for its ‘playing’.</p>
      <p><i>Sims </i>gets extra points because I was like 8 at the time so this function was extra horny and dangerous.</p>
      <p>Extra, extra points for its “Move_objects on” cheat that’d allow you to remove the bed and show the Sims hugging naked while suspended in the air. (Hehehhe.)</p>

      <h3>2ND PLACE – SIMS 4</h3>
      <p>It’s essentially <i>Sims 3</i> but in higher definition. Slightly boring, but I think that’s because we’re older now and are expecting something equivalent to Pornhub. It gets silver because you can woohoo in a rocketship. Respect.</p>
      <h3>1ST PLACE – SIMS 2</h3>
      <p>With the inclusion of cut-scenes and a full cinematic production whenever a couple woohoo’d, <i>Sims 2</i> was hands-down the horniest game out there. Like, next level horny – I still get flustered thinking about it.</p>
      <p>When it was time to get down to business, I would gain intense satisfaction from watching the same 30-second motion picture that would ensue, complete with closeups of intense snogging, flailing limbs and a cat-and-mouse narrative that was absolutely deserving of a Logie. (Shout outs to those who made their <i>Sims</i> fuck in the walk-in wardrobe to avoid the motion picture, you dirty rabbits.)</p>
      <p>The developers did not come to play… or maybe they DID come to play… Long story short, <i>Sims 2</i> production meetings must have been so unbelievable horny.</p>

      <p>IT’S SO EXTRA. I DIE (in admiration).</p>
