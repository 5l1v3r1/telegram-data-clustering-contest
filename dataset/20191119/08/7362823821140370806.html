      <p>Family told <a href="http://www.kptv.com/news/vancouver-woman-says-sister-injured-in-las-vegas-shooting-has/article_af9198c6-099c-11ea-87c1-37de7096726f.html">Fox 11 in Portland, Ore.</a>, that Gervais was paralyzed from the neck up. Her heart stopped as a result of the stress on her body from the injuries she sustained, Dena Sarvela, Gervais’ sister from Washington state, told the station. Gervais had scrap metal lodged inside of her as a result of “exploding bullets,” according to her sister.</p>
      <p>“It took almost a year before she was able to transport out to go back home to California, that was rough,” Sarvela said. “She lost her zest for life because of it, because of the shooting, because of her injuries that she sustained. It was hard to be that same person, that we all know and love.”</p>
      <p>“She was ready to retire. Her and I spoke the night before she went to the concert,” Sarvela continued. “She was going to sell the business, she was ready to just go abroad and enjoy life, like she should have, and it was snatched from her. She worked her life, and butt off for – just to go enjoy, you know, and she doesn’t get that, she doesn’t get that chance.”</p>
