      <h2>Arsenal had reportedly made contact with former Spain manager Luis Enrique as Unai Emery's future has been made uncertain following a series of disappointing results</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:42:13+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal are set to miss out on managerial target Luis Enrique - with the former Barcelona manager set to be named Spain boss.</p>
      <p>Gunners' head of football Raul Sanllehi was reported to have made contact with Enrique after compiling a list of potential replacements for under pressure Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Current boss Emery has endured a torrid spell in north London - with his side on a run on five games without a win in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Arsenal's last Premier League victory came on October 6 when they edged a 1-0 victory over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> - with the Gunners sixth in the table and eight points adrift of the top four.</p>

      <p>And last week it emerged that Sanllehi had touched base with Enrique over potentially moving to England.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and Barca midfielder Enrique hasn't had a job since he resigned as Spain boss in June, following his daughter Xana's diagnosis and subsequent tragic death from bone cancer.</p>
      <p>But he appears to be on course for an emotional return to the international post for Euro 2020.</p>

      <p>Current La Roja chief Robert Moreno, who was Enrique’s No.2, left the Wanda Metropolitano in tears after Spain's 5-0 victory over Romania.</p>
      <p>"I consider Luis a friend and ahead of everything is friendship," Moreno said.</p>
      <p>"If one day he wants to return, I would be delighted to take a step to the side and work with him.”</p>
      <p>"[I have] No need to sit down with Rubiales, nor [sporting director Jose] Molina, who are the people who trust me and I trust.</p>
      <p>"I give more value to what they tell me privately.</p>
      <p>"They have always told me everything they had to say to me. I did not expect any more roundness from the president."</p>
      <p>Enrique has previously suggested that he would like to manage in the Premier League in the future.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to manage in England at some point," he said. "My wife wouldn't like the weather, she's from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and likes the sun. It would depend on the team and the football they played."</p>
