      <h1>Google's redesigned 'My Devices' page now tracks computers</h1>
      <h2>Manage your Chromebook along with your Android mobile devices.</h2>

      <p>Google's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/02/google-my-account-find-your-phone/">My Devices</a> page has largely been replaced by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/18/google-lost-android-find-my-device/">Find My Device</a> feature, but it's still widely used by G Suite users. Up until now, it's only worked with phones and tablets, but Google has finally <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/new-my-devices-page-find-manage-devices.html">updated the app</a> with a fresh look and the ability to manage desktop computers, as well.</p>

      <p>That'll let you do the same things with a laptop that you can do with your phone, like wipe, lock and locate it. The new interface (above) is more user-friendly than before, as well, letting you check info, management and location for each device. Find My Device works in much the same way, but is directed more at consumers rather than G Suite business users. You can also use the "<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">your devices</a>" panel to find and sign out of your desktop, Android and Wear OS devices.</p>
      <p>The panel also has a new URL at <a href="http://mydevices.google.com/">mydevices.google.com</a> (for G Suite users only) but it will redirect the <a href="https://google.com/apps/mydevices">old one</a> to that address. The new page will take between one and three days to work for everyone, Google said.</p>
