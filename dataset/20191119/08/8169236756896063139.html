        <b>Erling Haaland has been spotted dropping a potential transfer hint by following Manchester United on Twitter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Norwegian wonderkid is enjoying a superb season with a prolific run of form and some eye-catching displays in the Champions League.</p>

      <p>This has led to rumours of interest from United in a potential £85million deal, and he’s now fuelled that speculation in a big way.</p>
      <p>See below as Haaland has just started following Man Utd on Twitter…</p>

      <p>The 19-year-old striker also follows MUFC forward Marcus Rashford, so it may be that he’s trying to get the attention of key figures at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that Haaland has also been linked with the likes of Liverpool and Real Madrid, but it seems he’s hinting at a preference for a move to Manchester.</p>
      <p>If the Red Devils could get this signing done this January, Haaland could be a superb long-term purchase as he shows signs of becoming one of the best strikers in the world.</p>
