      <p>A light aircraft was on Monday evening forced to make an emergency landing at the Malindi International Aiport after losing one of its wheels mid-air.</p>
      <p>The aircraft, Cessna 152, belonging to the Kenya School of Flying, was being operated by a trainee pilot during the 3.15 PM incident. He was the sole occupant of the plane.</p>
      <p>Malindi airport manager Mohammed Karama confirmed the incident saying the trainee identified as Emmanuel Omindi had to fly for two hours to avoid explosion when landing.</p>
      <p>Further reports indicate that Omindi was advised to keep the aircraft airborne to exhaust its fuel consequently avoid an explosion.</p>
      <p>“The control tower noticed that its fore wheel was missing while mid-air and the pilot was advised to fly for two hours due to security reasons,” said Karama.</p>

      <p>No casualties were reported during the incident.</p>
      <p>“He crash-landed but he did not suffer injuries, although he was taken to the hospital together with his tutor who was directing him while mid-air for psychological counselling due to trauma,” he said.</p>
      <p>To avert a calamity during landing, fire brigadiers and medical personnel, as well as security teams, were on standby at the airport.</p>

      <p>The plane and a section of the runway were, however, damaged during the incident.</p>
      <p>This is not the first incident to be reported in the area with locals pointing fingers at the Kenya School of Flying for failing to properly maintain its planes.</p>
      <p>In November 2018, a trainee pilot survived a crash after a light aircraft failed to ascend high enough during take-off and crashed into an electric post in Furunzi in Malindi.</p>
