      <p>AUSTRALIANS planning to fly home for Christmas could see their plans disrupted as Jetstar pilots threaten to strike in mid-December.</p>
      <p>The Fair Work Commission has authorised the pilots union on Monday to hold a ballot vote to determine whether they’ll be moving further with their actions, which would include work stoppages of up to 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Pay negotiations broke down after the company proposed a three per cent annual wage rise and the union asked for 15 per cent, the union reported.</p>
      <p>AFAP executive director Simon Lutton said the union was taking the step because its members were disappointed negotiations with Jetstar over a new enterprise agreement had stalled.</p>
      <p>“As negotiating with the company in good faith has got them nowhere, they have been left with no choice,” he said.</p>
