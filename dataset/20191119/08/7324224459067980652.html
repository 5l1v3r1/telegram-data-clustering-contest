      <h1>Wolves' Matt Doherty strikes but Ireland facing Euro 2020 challenge</h1>
      <h2>Matt Doherty’s first international goal was not enough to book the Republic of Ireland their place in next summer’s European Championships.</h2>

      <p>The Wolves wing-back – playing under his first Wolves boss Mick McCarthy – headed in an equaliser against Denmark with five minutes left to play at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.</p>
      <p>However, they could not find a winner and were left third in Group D, with the prospect of battling 15 other teams for one of the four remaining Euro 2020 places in March.</p>
      <p>Denmark had grabbed the lead with 17 minutes remaining when Martin Braithwaite stretched to get his toe to Henrik Dalsgaard’s ball into the box and divert it past Darren Randolph.</p>
      <p>Doherty powered a downward header from Enda Stevens’ 85th-minute cross past the helpless Kasper Schmeichel to set up a grandstand finish, but ultimately to no avail.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa midfielder Conor Hourihane played 68 minutes in the draw, whilst former Villan Glenn Whelan also started and played 82 minutes.</p>
