      <h1>3-time MotoGP champion Jorge Lorenzo heads for Bali with a one-way ticket after retirement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:44:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>Three-time MotoGP champion Jorge Lorenzo, who retired from the sport on Sunday after his last race in Valencia, Spain, said he has bought a one-way ticket to Bali, where he plans to escape the cold European weather to “rest and disconnect.” </p>
      <p>“I have gotten a ticket for Bali, but it’s a one-way ticket, because I don’t know when I’ll return,” <a href="https://as.com/motor/2019/11/17/motociclismo/1574003021_471889.html#menu">Lorenzo said in an interview with Spanish media outlet <i>AS</i></a>, which was published on Sunday. </p>
      <p>Lorenzo announced his plans to retire from racing on Nov. 14. He ended his 18-year professional Grand Prix career with a 13th place finish on the Valencian Grand Prix. </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old, who made his MotoGP debut back in 2008, was a world champion in the 500cc class in 2010, 2012 and 2015 with Yamaha. The Spaniard was also a world champion in the 250cc class in 2006 and 2007.</p>
      <p>On his retirement, Lorenzo said he was “very happy,” and that he was relieved to have let go of the burden of his professional career. He seems delighted at the prospect of visiting Bali again, and not in a rush to figure out his next steps.</p>
      <p>In the interview, Lorenzo said he is heading to Bali to escape the cold in Spain, and to rest and disconnect on a sunny beach. </p>
      <p>“I don’t know if I’ll be [there] two, three weeks, or more. In Indonesia, they love me and respect me a lot. Surely I’ll enjoy a great time with the people there. Then we’ll see what I will do later in life.” </p>
      <p>Well, we can certainly understand why Bali is anyone’s next destination. Hopefully, the <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/officials-warn-of-landslides-floods-as-bali-enters-rainy-season/">incoming rainy season</a> wouldn’t spoil his fun on the island.</p>
