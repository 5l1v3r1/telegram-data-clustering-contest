        <b>Mason Greenwood is looking to emulate a former club captain at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> as he names <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/wayne-rooney/">Wayne Rooney</a> as one of his footballing idols.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 18-year-old is gradually making his way into the first team at Old Trafford having made 13 appearances so far this season in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The striker is yet to open his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> account, but has netted twice in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/europa-league/">Europa League</a> and once in the EFL Cup as he starts to justify the hype around his finishing abilities.</p>
      <p>A lot is expected of the England Under-21 international and he is aiming high in terms of players to emulate, with Rooney and former Barcelona, Real Madrid and Brazil striker Ronaldo named as the players he idolises.</p>
      <p>‘It has to be Rooney,’ Greenwood told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699313/Manchester-United-England-starlet-Mason-Greenwood-wants-Wayne-Rooney.html">Daily Mail</a>. ‘The Brazilian Ronaldo, too. They’ve always stood out for me and I’ve always looked up to them. Ronaldo was quite a while ago but my dad used to show me clips of him.</p>

      <p>‘Rooney is such a great goalscorer and that is what I want to be. You have to have a role model. I’ve never seen him, though. I’ve watched his games and the highlights on YouTube. Hopefully I’ll get to meet him one day.’</p>

      <p>It is slightly surprising that Greenwood and Rooney have never crossed paths, but the young forward is not short of other inspirational figures around him at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>While naming Rooney and Ronaldo as his role models, the teen also says manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and first team regular Marcus Rashford are sources of inspiration.</p>
      <p>‘The manager is a really nice person,’ said Greenwood. ‘Obviously he was a great goalscorer at United and I know about him, I’ve watched him. He’s a great manager in my eyes.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got so many role models around me and Marcus is another one. I just want to follow in his footsteps.’</p>
      <p>With nine Manchester United games in December, Greenwood is likely to get more game time, at least in the Europa League and EFL Cup, with United hosting Colchester United in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>However, he may not be thrilled about the club being <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/manchester-united-optimistic-of-completing-185m-double-deal-for-jadon-sancho-and-erling-haaland-11177372/">linked with moves for Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho in January</a>, arrivals that would likely hinder his progression into the first team.</p>
