      <p><b>Baxter Dury</b> will be back with his sixth studio album, <i>The Night Chancers</i>, on March 20 via Heavenly. He made the album with many of the same people who appeared on 2017’s great <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/listen-to-baxter-durys-great-new-lp-prince-of-tears/"><i>Prince of Tears</i></a>, including <b>Madeline Heart</b> and <b>Rose Elinor Dougall</b>, plus <b>Delilah Holliday</b> who he collaborated with on the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/baxter-dury-etienne-de-crecy-alison-statton-buzzcocks-ty-segall-qlowski-klaus-johann-grobe/">B.E.D.</a> record. But it also features new songwriting collaborator Shaun Paterson who helps Baxter bring new sounds into his palette of sounds. “Musically I’ve pushed on,” says Dury. “I had a formula for the previous records but now that’s done now. Everything was leading up to the full sound I had on <i>Prince Of Tears</i>, so I don’t need to do another one of those. I’ve done something different, something new, with this one and it’s been fun – although the orchestra was fucking expensive!”</p>
      <p>Lyrically, he’s still telling seedy tales of sad and desperate people, but the world of <i>The Night Chancers</i> is set in the wee hours when most people are asleep and those who aren’t are alone with their thoughts. “It’s meant to be a bit Kubrick-y, a psychological journey through the maze bit in The Shining,” Baxter says. “So they’re not all confessional, it’s more of a feeling projected into a filmic narrative. On some of the tracks different characters appear.” The first single is “Slumlord,” which might owe just a little to David Bowie’s “Lets Dance,” and features Dury’s signature thick-accented London delivery, vivid lyrical imagery (“Shiny cheekbones like graveyards in the sun”) and creative swearing. Listen to that below.</p>
      <p>The cover photo for <i>The Night Chancers</i> was taken on the NYC subways — maybe Baxter will actually play here for this record (he hasn’t toured North America for his last three albums).</p>
