      <p>It happened at about 1pm on November 6 while a woman was loading shopping into her car at a supermarket on Meole Brance Retail Park.</p>
      <p>A cloth bag containing a purse and a debit card was stolen, officers said.</p>
      <p>The suspected offender was described to police as a foreign male in his mid 40s, wearing a dark baseball cap.</p>
      <p>It is believed the victim was distracted while the purse was stolen.</p>
      <p>Staff at the supermarket helped the shopper to cancel her card.</p>
      <p>On November 10, a walker on Lyth Hill received a telephone call from her bank to say her card had been used fraudulently at a local supermarket.</p>
      <p>Police said when she returned to her car she found the back window had been smashed and a bag containing a wallet, cash and various cards had been stolen.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact police on 101.</p>
