      <p>Oupa Manyisa’s injury could put his long-term future with Mamelodi Sundowns up in the air.</p>
      <p>The midfielder underwent an operation on his Achilles tendon after rupturing it in October this year, with it being revealed that the player is expected to be ruled out for the rest of the season.</p>

      <p>However, as reported in issue number 1149 of Soccer Laduma, indications are that Manyisa’s contract with the Brazilians will come to an end on June 30, 2020 and his injury and lack of game-time will influence whether or not he will continue on Sundowns’ books beyond the current season.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians’ addition of Sammy Seabi at the beginning of the season also sees the 31-year-old with more competition in the midfield and his injury couldn’t have come at a more critical time.</p>
      <p>According to Siya sources, the parties concerned are yet to open up talks regarding a new deal at the Chloorkop-based club, although for now, the player is focusing on his recovery.</p>
      <p>However, it remains to be seen what decision Sundowns will look to make in the coming months and whether or not Manyisa will still be at the club next season.  </p>
