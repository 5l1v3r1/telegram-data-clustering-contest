      <p>But the party has now suspended him and withdrawn its support after alleged comments made online seven years ago.</p>
      <p>Mr Houghton issued a statement and an apology on social media last night.</p>
      <p>He said he had discussed freedom of speech and comments made by <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/558175/nazi-sympathiser-david-irving-who-dismissed-auschwitzs-gas-chambers-as-a-fairytale-is-living-in-highland-hideaway-in-nairn/">notorious Holocaust denier David Irving</a> in one of the forums.</p>
      <p>The ex-Tory candidate also apologised to the Jewish community of Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said: "At the age of 20 on an online forum, I took part in a range of political discussions.</p>

      <p>"These included terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>"In one of these threads started by another member of the forum there was a conversation about freedom of speech.</p>
      <p>"There then followed a discussion about the Holocaust denier and now disgraced historian David Irving started by other members.</p>
      <p>"In explaining David Irving's position after watching one of his lectures online, I had reference his view that parts of the holocaust had been fabricated and exaggerated.</p>
      <p>"I made clear in subsequent forum posts that I was not defending the views of David Irving and I strongly opposed any Holocaust denial.</p>
      <p>"Having been a member of the Holocaust Educational Trust, visited Auschwitz-Birkenau and as someone who has been a friend of the Jewish community here in Aberdeen, I have never held ant-Semitic or intolerant views.</p>
      <p>"The last thing we need in the current climate is even the impression of more anti-Semitism and I cannot fathom the hurt members of the Jewish community experience, especially when individuals who make comments are later elected to public office.</p>
      <p>"I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish community in Aberdeen."</p>
      <p>Mr Houghton added that he would cooperate with a Tory investigation and "looked forward to clearing my name".</p>
      <p>The party confirmed that he had been suspended.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: “The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result.</p>
      <p>"The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North.</p>
      <p>"The Scottish Conservatives deplores all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-semitism.”</p>
