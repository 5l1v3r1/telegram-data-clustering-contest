      <p>Asian shares had a mixed time last night as traders held back from making big moves until there is more clarity over the US-China trade negotiations.</p>
      <p>European stock markets have opened broadly higher this morning following a subdued day yesterday.</p>

      <p>China’s Shanghai composite stock index rose 0.85 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed 1.47 per cent despite another day of violence rocking the city.</p>
      <p>Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.53 per cent, however, while Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.34 per cent and Singapore’s STI dropped 0.66 per cent.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the UK’s FTSE 100 rose 0.42 per cent shortly after the bell, the German Dax climbed 0.41 per cent and France’s CAC 40 was up 0.23 per cent.</p>
      <p>The flow of information coming out of the US-China tariff war talks has recently slowed. CNBC last night reported that the mood in Beijing was pessimistic.</p>
      <p>Yet there have been some positive signs. US companies have been allowed to keep doing business with giant Chinese tech firm Huawei, for example.</p>
      <p>“Overall, we think the chance of a complete breakdown in talks is now lower, and the chance of a positive resolution – potentially including a rollback of tariffs – is higher,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p>
      <p>Political pressure ahead of the 2020 [US presidential] elections is rising, and a workable agreement would enable President [Donald] Trump to ‘declare victory” ahead of the vote,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile, monetary policy and fundamentals are also now more supportive and we have adopted a neutral stance overall on equities.”</p>

      <p>The Hong Kong stock index’s solid rise came despite chaotic scenes in the city yesterday. Police laid siege to and attempted to storm a major university in which student protesters were holed up.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s economy has been hard-hit by the protests which have rocked the city since April. The city fell into its first recession in a decade in the third quarter, with the economy shrinking by 3.2 per cent.</p>
