      <h1>Meet Gary Palmer - the batting guru who is English cricket's best-kept secret</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tim-wigmore/" target="_blank">Tim Wigmore</a></address>
      <p>Before the Headingley Test against New Zealand in 2015, Alastair Cook took a detour via a farm just north of Oxford for a meeting with batting coach Gary Palmer. Even after making 162 in his previous Test innings, Cook wanted <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2018/09/03/alastair-cook-10-best-test-innings-ranked/">to further hone his game</a>. </p>
      <p>There was just snag: all of Cook’s kit was already en route to Headingley. </p>
      <p>“We still did the session,” Palmer recalls. “I had to go into the garage and take him out a pair of right-handed gloves, right-handed pads and one of my son’s cricket bats.” </p>
      <p>For the next three hours or so, Cook underwent a typical session with Palmer, on the old tennis court that he had converted into a cricket net. The fulcrum of this is what Palmer calls the ABC: “Alignment, Balance and Completion of shots.” </p>
      <p>On Wednesday night, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/11/12/meet-dominic-sibley-englands-new-opening-test-batsman-old-fashioned/">Dominic Sibley</a> will become the latest player familiar with Palmer’s ABC to play for England, joining players including Cook, Ian Bell and Nick Compton. The metamorphosis in Sibley's record since he started enlisting Palmer near the end of the summer of 2018 has been remarkable: from a first-class average of 30 before, Sibley has a first-class average of 72 after. </p>
      <p>“You could call me old school,” Palmer says. “I believe there is not enough emphasis on technique.” Like several of Palmer’s previous clients, Sibley is renowned for the solidity of his defensive game. </p>
      <p>“The stuff I do is very technical. People come to come because they’ve got technical faults or they're getting out in a particular way or they're struggling to score in certain areas. Basically they come because they’re out of form and they need it fixing.” </p>

      <p>At the core of this approach is simply hitting a lot of cricket balls. In a typical three-hour session, a player will face between 95 and 100 overs: 570-600 deliveries. “It’s about hitting the balls to a high technical standard and striving for perfection all the time.” </p>
      <p>To achieve this, Palmer likes to set up two bowling machines: one from over the wicket, and one from around the wicket. “I use two bowling machines to find fault in alignment and balance. By doing one each side you’re honing their alignment and balance to hit a straight ball from any angle and any swing type.” </p>
      <p>First, the drills entail balls from over the wicket swinging into the batsman, and balls from around the wicket swinging away. Then, when Palmer and the player are satisfied, the swing is reversed. </p>
      <p>“I put a player in a set position to show them that hitting it straight, whether it's swinging in or out, you need pretty much the same body position to hit the ball down the ground.” </p>
      <p>While Palmer tweaks his approach for every player, generally he believes that most players could bat with a more open stance. With Cook, a regular client from 2015, Palmer worked on making his front shoulder more open, and getting his knees and feet to point forward, rather than back. Sibley has also opened up his stance since working with Palmer, a change aimed at making it easier to hit straight. </p>

      <p>Palmer - who is paid by the players, and has no relationship with England Cricket - embodies a burgeoning trend: the rise of private coaches. While players have often had trusted mentors, the notion of the freelance coach reflects the sport’s hyper-professionalisation, and the curiosity of modern cricketers, and mirrors a similar trend in baseball. </p>
      <p>With cricketers earning more cash, investing in a private coach has become more appealing, given the financial gains a player can enjoy from their batting average ticking up a couple of points. Freelance coaches amount to recognition that - given the different ways that different players learn - the best coach for one person, however good, may not be the best coach for all of them. </p>
      <p>Cricket’s underlying peculiarity - it is the only sport with three international formats - renders private coaches particularly appealing. While county head coaches grapple with the competing demands of different games, players searching for bespoke attention may need to seek out their own private coaches. </p>
      <p>Leading T20 players now routinely play for half-a-dozen teams, each with their own coterie of support staff, a year. Given this ever-changing cast of characters - and the likelihood that a player’s head coach in one league will work for an opposing team in another league - players are gravitating towards private coaches that they can trust. </p>
      <p>As in many aspects of T20, the West Indies have been pioneers. Carl Crowe, the former Leicestershire spin bowler, effectively acts as the private coach for several spinners - most notably Sunil Narine, who Crowe worked with to remodel his action. </p>

      <p>Crowe has even been enlisted by Narine to fly out to tournaments; on other occasions, teams have recruited Crowe as a spin consultant after observing the work he has done with Narine. So Crowe’s role for Narine is best conceived of as less a traditional cricket coach than a tennis coach: working for, and contracted to, a player. More freelance coaches are a logical corollary of a world with more freelance cricketers. </p>
      <p>“I think we’ll see a more tennis style coaching system,” Crowe says. “It’s very difficult to make any kind of significant impact on the player's game only working with them on a short-term basis for a tournament. And this is why some players enjoy having their own coaches with them.” </p>
      <p>Like any shift that threatens insiders - the existing head coaches - this change is bringing tensions, too. The England &amp; Wales Cricket Board has not always seemed supportive of private coaches; Cook was initially coy about revealing his work with Palmer. While the ECB’s stance has evolved, not all of Palmer’s clients today tell their county coaches they work with him. </p>
      <p>“When a player goes outside the system, some coaches won’t like that,” Palmer reflects. “Some won’t mind it. I’m just trying to help that player. If the help I give that player helps them score more runs, then it’s a win-win for everyone.” </p>
