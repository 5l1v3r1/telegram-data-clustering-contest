      <h2>Traffic on the busy Jawaharlal Nehru Road-Shanthi Colony Road junction was affected</h2>

      <p>Water seeped through a damaged pipeline on the busy Jawaharlal Nehru Road-Shanthi Colony Road junction in Anna Nagar, flooding a portion of the road on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The leak affected traffic on the road, as vehicles had to negotiate the waterlogged stretch to reach Shanthi Colony Road and Third Avenue, Anna Nagar.</p>
      <p>Residents noted that the water seeped through the damaged portion of the pipeline during the water supply hours. Drinking water was being wasted for the past one or two days as the water leak has been left unattended, they said. Such water leaks were becoming a recurring phenomenon and damaged the road near the junction, residents said.</p>
      <p>The residents demanded the water leak be arrested as the water shortage in the area, which was acute, has decreased only over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>Chennai Metrowater has increased the drinking water supply from 525 million litres of water daily to 650 mld since October-end.</p>
      <p>Responding to residents’ complaints, sources at Metrowater said the water leak had occurred due to damage in the joints of the pipeline. Workers are involved in identifying the damage in the 1,200 mm diameter main pipeline on the Jawaharlal Nehru Road opposite VR mall.</p>
      <p>“We will repair the pipeline and arrest the leak by Tuesday night,” said an official.</p>
