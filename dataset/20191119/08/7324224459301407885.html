      <h2>Wolverhampton Speedway have kick-started their team rebuilding plan for the 2020 season with Kyle Howarth leaving Monmore.</h2>

      <p>In a statement, the club said : “Both rider and club have held in-depth talks and feel the time is right for the Mancunian to seek a new opportunity at Premiership level.”</p>
      <p>Howarth, 25, has been with Parrys International Wolves for four seasons and won the league title with them in 2016.</p>
      <p>Promoter Chris Van Straaten said: “We haven’t fallen out with Kyle, far from it, we will remain good friends. He’s always given his all in Wolverhampton colours and he’s a smashing lad to be around.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes there comes a time when a change feels right and both Kyle and ourselves agreed that was the way forward. I’m sure he’ll look forward to his Monmore visits next season in the opposing camp!</p>
      <p>“On behalf of everyone at the club, I would like to wish Kyle well and thank him for all his efforts during his time with us.”</p>
