      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Pakistan">Pakistan</a> has resumed postal mail service with India, nearly three months after it was suspended in the wake of India's decision to end the special status of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jammu-and-Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, the Pakistan media reported on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after New Delhi abrogated provisions of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Article-370">Article 370</a> of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.</p>
      <p>India's August 5 decision evoked strong reactions from Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Islamabad">Islamabad</a> suspended all communication links with India as well as the trade ties.</p>
      <p>According to the Pakistani media, the postal mail service with India has resumed, but the parcel service will remain suspended.</p>
      <p>However, there was no official announcement on the resumption of the limited postal service with India.</p>
      <p>Pakistan had not accepted any postal consignment from India after August 27 in a move seen as a retaliation of scrapping of special status for Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Communications and IT Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ravi-Shankar-Prasad">Ravi Shankar Prasad</a>, who is also in-charge of the postal department, said in October that Islamabad resorted to stopping postal mail service unilaterally and without giving any prior notice to India.</p>
      <p>"Pakistan's decision is directly in contravention of world postal union norms. But Pakistan is Pakistan," Prasad had said.</p>
      <p>Pakistan's move was unprecedented as the postal mail service had continued in the past even through the partition, wars, and cross-border tensions.</p>
