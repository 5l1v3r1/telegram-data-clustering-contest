      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/kss-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Kohl's</a> shares plunged as much as 13% in early Tuesday trading after the retail chain missed third-quarter estimates and lowered its expectations for full-year earnings.</p>
      <p>The company's quarterly revenue and profit figures fell below analyst expectations. Kohl's also issued its second guidance cut of the year, moving its full-year profit forecast even lower from its initial estimate.</p>
      <p>It will be crucially important for the retailer to take advantage of the consumer-spending boost that normally accompanies the holiday season. CEO Michelle Gass assured investors the company is taking steps to benefit from the year-end sales boom.</p>
      <p>"We enter the holiday period with momentum and are strategically increasing our investments to take advantage of the unique opportunity to fuel growth and customer acquisition," Gass <a href="https://corporate.kohls.com/news/archive-/2019/november/kohl-s-corporation-reports-financial-results">said in a statement</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here are the key numbers:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Adjusted earnings per share:</b> $0.74, versus the $0.86 estimate</p>
      <p><b>Revenue:</b> $4.36 billion, versus the $4.40 billion estimate</p>
      <p><b>Comparable sales growth:</b> 0.4%, versus the 0.8% estimate</p>
      <p><b>Full-year EPS guidance:</b> $4.75 to $4.95, versus the $5.19 estimate</p>
      <p>Kohl's first lowered its 2019 guidance <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/kohls-earnings-stock-price-plunges-after-slashing-guidance-2019-5-1028217315?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">in May</a> after posting disappointing first-quarter figures. The chain forecasted adjusted earnings at between $5.15 to $5.45 per share, lower than its previous guidance of $5.80 to $6.15.</p>
      <p>The chain's comparable sales growth fell well under its year-ago performance. Same-store sales grew 2.5% in the third quarter of 2018. The continued lag through 2019 points to a potential strategy blunder, as Gass' plan to use smaller stores and partnerships fails to pull the company from a steady decline.</p>
      <p>The CEO focused on the positive comparable sales figure, highlighting a return to store growth despite the year-over-year tumble.</p>
      <p>"We are pleased to report that our business returned to growth during the third quarter, with a comparable sales increase of 0.4%," Gass <a href="https://corporate.kohls.com/news/archive-/2019/november/kohl-s-corporation-reports-financial-results">said in the quarterly report</a>. "We believe that investing in the short-term will support our strategies to drive profitable growth over the long-term."</p>
      <p>Kohl's closed Monday at $58.40 per share, down about 12% year-to-date.</p>
      <p>The company has nine "buy" ratings, eight "hold" ratings, and two "sell" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $57.53, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
