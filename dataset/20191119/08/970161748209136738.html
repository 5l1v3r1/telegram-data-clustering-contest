      <p>A carer who left an 89-year-old woman to die on her bedroom floor had false papers and was in the UK illegally, the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>Hind Al-Charabi was found lying ‘naked and broken on the cold tiled floor’ at home in Ealing, west London, on November 17 last year.</p>
      <p>Her carer Sibusisiwe Msipha, 38, told police the pensioner fell out of bed and she had been unable to lift her back up, but failed to call for help.</p>
      <p>During the subsequent investigation it emerged Msipha had fake identity documents and no right to be in the country, which may have been the reason for her reluctance to raise the alarm.</p>
      <p>Msipha was arrested walking away from the address with a suitcase and taken to a North London police station.</p>
      <p>She eventually pleaded guilty to wilful neglect causing death as well as fraud and was jailed for a total of 33 months.</p>

      <p>Mrs Al-Charabi’s son, Khaldoun Zeitouni, said his mother was a ‘gentle and kind lady’ who had always been ‘chatty, caring and very loving’ towards the entire family.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘She was so generous with her time and emotional support. She was everything to me: my best friend, the person I would go to, often my companion, and my mum.</p>
      <p>‘What makes it even worse is the thought of how she died. I have so many unanswered questions as to what happened, the extent of her injuries, whether she was in any pain, how long it had taken for her to pass away and was she calling out for me or for help?’</p>
      <p>Detective inspector James Howarth, said: ‘Sibusisiwe Msipha should have had the care of a vulnerable 89-year-old lady as her top priority. She failed in that duty.</p>
      <p>‘Msipha inexcusably abandoned Mrs Hind Al-Charabi to pass away on her own and showed a total disregard for the safety and security of a fellow human being.</p>
      <p>‘Mrs Al-Charabi’s family have suffered intolerably and whilst no sentence can ever make up for the loss of a loved one, we are pleased that justice has been served today.’</p>
