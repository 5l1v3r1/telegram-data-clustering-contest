      <h3>Glen Johnson says Liverpool FC star Trent Alexander-Arnold is easily the best right-back in the Premier League.</h3>
      <p>The 21-year-old has played a key role in Liverpool FC’s impressive start to the Premier League campaign so far this term.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold played a part in Liverpool FC’s second goal in their 3-1 victory over defending champions Manchester City last time out.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool-born full-back has scored one goal and has made two assists in 12 games in the Premier League in the current campaign.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold netted in Liverpool FC’s 2-1 victory over third-placed Chelsea FC back in September.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC defender Johnson believes that Alexander-Arnold is the standout right-back in the Premier League based on current form.</p>
      <p>“Trent Alexander-Arnold. By miles at the moment,” Johnson told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1204059/Liverpool-news-Trent-Alexander-Arnold-Aaron-Wan-Bissaka-Reece-James-Glen-Johnson">Daily Express</a>.</p>
      <p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka moved to Manchester United in a £50m deal from Crystal Palace in the summer.</p>
      <p>The England international initially impressed at his new club before his form dipped as the 20-time English champions started to toil.</p>
      <p>Comparing Wan-Bissaka to Alexander-Arnold, Johnson added:</p>
      <p>“Aaron Wan-Bissaka isn’t so much the modern full-back, he sometimes looks like a centre-half playing full-back,” Johnson said.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good defender but he’s not got the natural ability that Trent has got.”</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold scored one goal and made 12 assists in the Premier League last season.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool FC youth graduate was part of Klopp’s team that won the Champions League thanks to a 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur in the showpiece.</p>
      <p>The Reds are sitting eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC in the Premier League title race.</p>
