        <b>Time could be running out for Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino following their dismal start to the Premier League season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spurs are already 20 points behind leaders Liverpool after just three wins from their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/mauricio-pochettino-holds-crisis-talks-daniel-levy-tottenhams/">The Telegraph</a> is reporting that Pochettino held talks with chairman Daniel Levy over his future at the club.</p>
      <p>Spurs travel to rivals West Ham this weekend looking for a first away win of the season in the top-flight.</p>
      <p>The Argentine has led the club to four consecutive top-four finishes in the Premier League but 2019 has seen a major dip in form, although Spurs did manage to reach the Champions League final in June.</p>
      <p>There are growing fears among Tottenham's hierarchy over Pochettino's ability to turn things around and challenge for a top-four spot.</p>
      <p>If Spurs do decide to part company with the 47-year-old, the club would have to pay more than £10 million in compensation but the pair could come to a mutual agreement over his exit.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has suggested before that he could leave the club, most notably ahead of last season’s Champions League final against Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is the bookies favourite to be the next Tottenham manager.</p>
