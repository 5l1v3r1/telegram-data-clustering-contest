      <h1>I'm A Celebrity fans baffled by Myles Stephenson's 'pointless' luxury item</h1>
      <h2>This year's I'm A Celebrity campmates requested some very unusual items to take in the jungle with them</h2>

      <p>During the latest episode of I'm A Celebrity, the campmates were tasked with retrieving their much-longed for luxury items as part of a late night mini-challenge.</p>
      <p>With the famous faces forced to live in basic al fresco conditions with no contact from their families for up to a month, home comforts are of vital importance when it comes to jungle survival.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night's show as each celebrity revealed what they had selected to bring with them for support, viewers were left double-taking when they heard Myles Stephenson's canny idea.</p>

      <p>The Rak-Su singer announced that he had opted to take a disposable camera in with him, allowing him to 'make memories' of his time on the ITV entertainment show.</p>
      <p>Fans of the show were left in hysterics by his decision which seemed to forget that his antics were being filmed around the clock by an ITV production crew.</p>
      <p>"Can’t get over the fact Myles wanted a disposable camera for memories of something that’s on national television," said one viewer.</p>
      <p>"If you ever feel stupid, just remember that Myles chose a disposable camera as his luxury item...in the jungle...on ITV...24/7," laughed another.</p>

      <p>"So Myles wanted to bring a camera into the jungle to make some memories. If only there was another way he could look back at his time in there," mused a third.</p>
      <p>While another questioned: "Does Myles know he's on TV? Why would he need a disposable camera when every second is covered by a dozen high definition cameras with zoom capabilities?"</p>
      <p>But other fans of the ITV show thought Myles' luxury item showed a rather thoughtful side to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> champion.</p>

      <p>"The fact Myles had a camera as his luxury item to make memories honestly makes my heart hurt. He’s so cute and caring and ahh I just love him and it’s only day two," gushed one fan.</p>
      <p>Despite Myles' good intentions, the camera never reached his hands. The charitable star offered up his luxury item for a 'practice round' as the celebs got to grips with the game.</p>
      <p>The main camp were challenged with securing each parcel from a pile and moving into a safe box across a pond using nothing but wooden oars.</p>
      <p>Their balancing skills proved woeful with only two items making it back to camp.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway was gifted her concealer and rather usually, Adele Roberts returned with a framed photo of Jane McDonald who she described as a 'legend'.</p>
