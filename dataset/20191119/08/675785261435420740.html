      <p>Marcus Rashford insists he has overcome a "tough period" at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> - and is now reaping the rewards for club and country.</p>
      <p>Rashford endured a difficult start to the campaign but with nine goals in his last 10 appearances for United and England he is enjoying some of the best form of his career so far.</p>
      <p>And he puts that down to a consistent run of games following his most recent strike for the Three Lions in their victory in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>"It has been a tough period and now I'm getting consistent games and playing week in, week out," he said."As a forward that has huge importance.</p>

      <p>"If you are not in the team and you're in and out, you don't quite have that confidence in front of goal.</p>
      <p>"But when you're having a run in the team it's important to come up with the goods and once you start doing that it becomes second nature."</p>
      <p>England romped to Euro 2020 qualification hitting 37 goals in eight matches and only slipping up in the Czech Republic in an otherwise perfect campaign.</p>
      <p>They scored 11 times in their final two qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo and Rashford stressed the importance of the Three Lions' attack for next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>"I have been in two tournaments now and the squad is so important," he added. "With the qualities that every individual has in this team it is something we have to use to our advantage.</p>
      <p>"People are going to be playing at different moments but when you are on the pitch you have to do your best, and try to come up with the goods. It is good competition."</p>
