      <p>Cape Town - <b>Stormers</b> coach<b> John Dobson</b> has confirmed that <b>Siya Kolisi </b>will lead the team in next year's Super Rugby competition but stressed the importance of managing the Springbok captain carefully.</p>
      <p>"Siya will be the skipper," Dobson told reporters at the Stormers' High Performance Centre in Bellville on Monday.</p>
      <p>While the Stormers are hard at work preparing for next year's Super Rugby edition, Dobson said the World Cup-winning Springboks would only return sometime in December.</p>
      <p>Dobson will give the returning Boks more time off after a gruelling week in which they toured the country on the Springboks' trophy parade</p>
      <p>"It was going to be the second of December, with the exception of Pieter-Steph (du Toit - as per agreed in his contract), but the players have spent a week on a bus, so we may be pushing (their return) back a week or two," Dobson said.</p>
      <p>Kolisi has become a superstar in the country and managing the Bok skipper would be paramount, Dobson stressed.</p>
      <p>"He is the captain and he'll be the leader of the group but I shudder to think of the demands being made of him at the moment. We're going to have manage him."</p>
      <p>Dobson said he would sit down with Kolisi to plot a way forward for the season ahead.</p>
      <p>"I'd be guided by him. I think that's the right way of doing it. I don't want to be overly na√Øve... we have to get momentum early in this competition so there's less pressure on us when we go on tour. And maybe that's the window where we could give him a bit of a break."</p>
      <p>In case of Kolisi getting a break, Dobson said he was impressed by the leadership abilities of another Springbok.</p>
      <p>"Steven Kitshoff did a great job as captain this year," the coach stressed.</p>
      <p>The Stormers also announced that their Super Rugby squad will be confirmed in due course, as will Dobson's management team.</p>
      <p>The Cape franchise open their 2020 Super Rugby campaign at home against the Hurricanes at Newlands on Saturday, February 1.</p>
