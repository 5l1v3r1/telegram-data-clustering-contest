      <p>Meanwhile, she’s not been afraid to show off her body, recently sharing a gorgeous photo shoot and writing: ‘This moment is sacred. This moment is about birth and RE-birth.</p>
      <p>‘This moment is discovering new parts of myself that I never knew existed before. This moment is about gaining clarity on what I will or will not except so that when my daughter watches me, she is clear on who she is and what she believes.</p>
      <p>This moment is understanding what’s worth my energy and what is not.  This moment is unapologetically leaning on those that truly understand the definition of family and friendship.</p>
      <p>This moment is about experiencing all that life has to offer me as a woman. I’m living and basking in the right now! And it feels damn good. #mothertobe.’</p>
