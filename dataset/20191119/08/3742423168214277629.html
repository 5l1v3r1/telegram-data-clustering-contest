      <h1>Update To iOS 13.2.3 Today To Squash These Bugs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/david-murphy" target="_blank">David Murphy</a></address>
      <p>Apple is back with another fresh update to iOS 13. We’re assuming you’ve already made the plunge, but if not, now is as good a time as any to upgrade to the latest operating system for your iPhone and iPad. And if you’re already there, great! It’s time to install another update to deal with some annoying, lingering bugs.</p>
      <p>The update isn’t huge and shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes or so to download and install to your device. To get started, simply visit <b>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</b>. It’s easy. While it chugs along, here’s a quick list of everything this update addresses:</p>
      <blockquote>   •  <br/><i>Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work.<br/></i><br/>   •  <br/><i>Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view.<br/></i><br/>   •  <br/><i>Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background.<br/></i><br/>   •  <br/><i>Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts.</i></blockquote>

      <p>That’s it! That’s not a huge list, but it’s certainly important if you’ve been struggling with Mail, background downloads, or searches within iOS or iPadOS. Not being able to find information on your device is a pretty big problem, I’d say.</p>
      <p>If you want to live a little more on the wild side, you could also grab <a href="https://betaprofiles.com/">a beta profile</a> and try out iOS 13.3 instead. Not only will you be able to play with using security keys alongside your iPhone or iPad for extra protection, but you’ll be able to finally disable <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/09/how-to-hide-memojis-in-ios-13-and-ipados-13">Animoji and Memoji</a> on your emoji keyboard (if you’re not a fan). And if you’re a parent, you’ll be able to use new Screen Time controls to set limits on how long your kid can call or message their friends.</p>
