      <p>Family Wolf, from Mishmeret in the center if the country, are in the midst of a legal battle with Clal Insurance. Wolf lost their home after a direct hit by a rocket in March, fired by Hamas in Gaza.</p>
      <p>The state has insurance covering people damaged by terrorist attacks or from security forces work. Wolf's house will be rebuilt in 2 months, the construction covered by the state. However, the state doesn't cover all of the contents.</p>
      <p><i>Israel HaYom</i> reported that family Wolf are covered by Clal Insurance on a number of different policies, including contents of a property. The family has approached Clal, but their claim was declined, as the family did not have insurance against terror.</p>
      <p>Clal Insurance responded; "We apologize for the distress caused to the client, but Clal would like to stress that it sent a new insurance policy highlighting all the possible policies possible, including a policy to cover terror. The client was not interested in adding terror attacks to his insurance and renewed last year's insurance with no change."</p>
