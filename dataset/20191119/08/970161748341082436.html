      <p>Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic says it feels ‘great’ to join LeBron James as the only player in NBA history under the age of 21 to record a 40-point triple-double, though won’t be dwelling on the milestone.</p>
      <p>Doncic, 20, guided the Mavs to a thrilling 117-110 victory over San Antonio Spurs on Monday night, scoring a career-high 42 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists.</p>
      <p>The Slovenian has been in outstanding form so far this season, recording six triple-doubles, but his latest feat marks him out as only the second under-21 player to collect a triple-double that included at least 40 points.</p>

      <p>Asked about joining his idol LeBron in the exclusive club, Doncic told reporters: ‘I mean it’s great, but it feels like every time there’s stats that you don’t know about and you’re with somebody like every day. It’s great, great to hear it.’</p>

      <p>Probed on why he didn’t seem excited about the triple-double, he shrugged his shoulders and continued: ‘Just game-by-game, I think we’re now fourth or fifth in the west and that’s what we want.</p>
      <p>‘We got a great start. We scored 22 points in the first quarter so especially offensively we were right there and that’s how we’ve got to start every game.’</p>
      <p>On his excellent defensive showing alongside the triple-double, he added: ‘I say I gotta play better defence. I think today was better than the other days, and I’ve just got to keep working on that and keep getting better and better.’</p>
      <p>Doncic is currently in talks over a sneaker deal and made history on Monday night while wearing the Under Armour Curry 7 Sour Patch Kids – though that does not mean he’ll be sticking with them.</p>
      <p>Asked about his choice of sneaker, he smiled and said: ‘I’m just a free agent so I’m trying shoes!’</p>

      <p>Mavs teammate Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 18 points, was full of praise for Doncic afterwards, saying: ‘Luka right now is playing like an MVP-calibre player right now. Career high for him, triple-double, I’m happy for him.</p>
      <p>‘He’s just doing thing, penetrating, drawing fouls, being super effective for us, shooting the ball well. He’s doing it all for us and I’m happy that he’s able to play at this level right now.’</p>
