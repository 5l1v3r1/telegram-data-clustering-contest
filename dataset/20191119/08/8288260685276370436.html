      <h1>Martin Lewis busts parking ticket myths and confirms when you don't have to pay</h1>
      <h2>Martin appeared on This Morning to discuss private parking tickets, telling one caller: “We did it on this show a few years ago, someone mis-heard, did a Facebook post about it that was then shared 300,000 times – and I've been trying to correct this one ever since.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:55:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Martin Lewis has debunked a string of private parking ticket myths on when you don't have to pay.</p>
      <p>Private parking fines are a very different beast to council-issued ones.</p>
      <p>But after a Facebook post went viral saying you didn't have to pay, financial expert Martin went on TV to explain the actual rules.</p>
      <p>The MoneySavingExpert founder is a financial guru full of handy tricks, tips and advice for consumers.</p>
      <p>His MSE website is widely used by Brits - and Martin now has his own ITV1 show to boot.</p>

      <p>He also routinely appears on a string of daytime TV favourites - from Good Morning Britain and This Morning to Lorraine.</p>
      <p>Martin appeared on This Morning to discuss private parking tickets, telling one caller: “We did it on this show a few years ago, someone mis-heard, did a Facebook post about it that was then shared 300,000 times – and I've been trying to correct this one ever since.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Private parking tickets are invoices," Martin explained.</p>
      <p>"So if they're unfair invoices you don't have to pay them.</p>
      <p>"But I would always inform them that you believe they're unfair, if they have an appeals system go back through the appeals system.</p>
      <p>"If they don't, write back and say it's unfair, and why you think it is."</p>
      <p>But he also warned: "I would not ignore them, and I have never taken that stance."</p>

      <h3>How to contest a Parking Charge Notice?</h3>
      <p>Simply respond that you are refusing to pay.</p>
      <p>DON'T say you are appealing the ticket, as this legitimises the ticket.</p>
      <p>Also write "Without Prejudice" on the letter – then no information in the letter can be used against you.</p>
      <h3>What happens next?</h3>
      <p>If the company rejects your dispute, then you can escalate to the firm's trade member association.</p>
      <p>You must have an official reference number from the company and their reasons for rejecting your dispute.</p>
      <p>They will refer you to POPLA, the Independent Tribunal for Parking Fines.</p>
      <p>Around 40 per cent of appeals are upheld in the favour of the public.</p>
      <p>If you wish to dispute the ticket, then you have 28 days in which to dispute after the firm that issued the ticket has rejected your appeal.</p>
      <h3>I've been issued a Penalty Charge Notice - what should I do now?</h3>
      <p>If you have received a parking ticket, the person who issued it has determined that you have parked your car somewhere you’re not allowed to.</p>
      <p>Firstly, you should work out if it's from the council, or a private company (these tend to look alike).</p>
      <p>Once issued with a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) you will be expected to pay a penalty charge of £130 for a serious parking offence or £40-80 for a less serious offence - although this can vary by council.</p>
      <p>You can reduce your fine by paying within 14-days.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>I want to appeal my case:</h3>
      <p>If you think the PCN has been issued wrongly you must make your reasons known as soon as you can by writing to the address on the notice or getting in touch <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-parking-fine">online.</a></p>
      <p>Your appeal will then be reviewed and you will be made aware of the outcome.</p>
      <p>You have 28 days to challenge a PCN.</p>
      <p>If you do it within 14 days and your challenge is rejected, you may only have to pay 50 per cent of the fine.</p>
      <p>If you're appealing your ticket, hold on to any photographs from the scene (e.g. unclear lines), letters you've received, mitigating circumstances and any statements if possible.</p>
      <p>This also includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A valid pay and display ticket</li>
        <li>A letter from someone who was with you saying what happened – write ‘Witness statement’ at the top of this</li>
        <li>A repair note, if your car broke down</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>
      <p>Make sure you include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The date the ticket was issued</li>
        <li>Your address</li>
        <li>Your vehicle registration number</li>
        <li>The penalty notice number</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To appeal your case, you'll need to prove your innocence.</p>
      <p>You can appeal if the traffic signs were wrong, the council has made an error on the ticket, you've already paid the fine, the signs are misleading or confusing, you didn't own the vehicle at the time or you've been overcharged.</p>
      <p>To start your appeal online, you'll have to enter your postcode <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-parking-fine">at Gov.uk's 'Challenge a parking fine' page here.</a></p>
