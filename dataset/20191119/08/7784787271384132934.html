      <h3>Delisted Tiger Jacob Townsend might’ve found another AFL home, with Essendon reportedly showing strong interest in the charismatic goalkicker.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-delistings-2019-jacob-townsend-richmond-lifeline-at-gws-giants-tackle-on-matt-crouch/news-story/ce22afc049bac0ffe0ea728bd673a01a">Townsend last month was delisted by Richmond</a> just before the first list deadline (October 31). It came two years after his remarkable 2017 campaign, which saw him claim the JJ Liston Trophy as the VFL’s best player before sliding into the AFL team’s best 22 to feature in the famous drought-breaking premiership.</p>

      <p>It was reported in the aftermath of his delisting that the Giants — the club that initially drafted him and he played 28 games for — were a “strong chance” to recruit him, possibly as a rookie.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-delistings-2019-jacob-townsend-richmond-lifeline-at-gws-giants-tackle-on-matt-crouch/news-story/ce22afc049bac0ffe0ea728bd673a01a">But AFL Media reported on Tuesday night</a> that Townsend was now on the radar of the Bombers, who are considering offering him a spot on their list for 2020.</p>
      <p>Multiple outlets also reported Townsend was spotted at Essendon’s Tullamarine headquarters last week.</p>

      <p>Should Townsend join the Bombers, he‘d likely be acquired in the pre-season supplemental selection period (SSP).</p>
      <p>After playing 28 games for the Giants, Townsend was traded to Richmond and managed 20 games in four seasons, including just one in 2019.</p>
      <p>But Townsend famously featured in Richmond’s last five games of 2017 and booted 16 goals, including two in the Grand Final.</p>
