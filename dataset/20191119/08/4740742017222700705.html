      <p>A group of women took to the streets of Bristol yesterday (Nov 18) on a mission to get homeless people to register to vote in the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a>.</p>
      <p>The registration drive comes as shocking figures reveal just two per cent of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/homelessness">homeless </a>people are on the electoral roll - and 48 councils around England do not have a single person registered to vote who doesn’t have a permanent address.</p>
      <p>But the leader of the campaign, Amy Liddle, said she is determined to get as many people to register as possible.</p>
      <p>Amy is from the tenants’ union Acorn, which has partnered with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation to get what are normally unheard voices - those of people in ‘vulnerable’ housing - heard through the ballot box.</p>
      <p>So Amy and her team are hitting the streets. During the afternoon, they are out in Broadmead signing up shoppers and city centre workers who are renting or sofa-surfing, and in the evening, they are getting to know the people visiting the various soup kitchens and hot meal stations, with BOSH, Bristol Outreach Services for the Homeless.</p>
      <p>But it’s not just rough sleepers being encouraged to sign up. With housing chiefs recently saying rough sleepers are just the 'tip of the iceberg' of the housing crisis, with 100 people in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/housing-crisis">vulnerable housing situations</a> for every one person visible on the streets, there are literally tens of thousands of people across Bristol who aren't registered to vote - mainly because of their precarious housing situation.</p>

      <p>“We’re looking to encourage and help register anyone in vulnerable housing - that could be people on the streets, but there are even more people who are sofa-surfing, in emergency accommodation, in refuges, in temporary accommodation, or who don’t have a permanent address,” she said.</p>
      <p>“That also includes students and even just people who are in private rented accommodation, who have to move around a lot and can tend to drop off the electoral register.</p>
      <p>“It’s shocking that 90 per cent of homeowners are registered to vote, but only 50 per cent of people in private rented housing are. What that means is that Government policy is tailored to help those groups who are registered to vote.</p>
      <p>“We think it’s really important that everyone registers to vote, even if they don’t have an address, if they are sofa-surfing, or if they are renting and aren’t registered because they keep moving,” she added.</p>

      <p>The Electoral Commission has actually made it a lot easier in recent years for people to register to vote even if they don’t have an address. “There’s a different form to fill in now,” said Amy, “where you can give a ‘care of’ address, and if you don’t have one, you can use BOSH’s in the city centre.”</p>
      <p>“People who are ‘no fixed abode’ think they can’t register, but they absolutely can,” she added.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been working with homeless outreach organisations, the Wild Goose, the Big Issue, BOSH and hostels, and there are so many people out there in vulnerable accommodation, who don’t have that permanent address, but they can still register,” she said.</p>
      <p>Amy and her team have pledged to not only help get the forms filled in, but also follow-up with help to find where the polling cards are sent to, and then on election day itself, with text messages reminding them where their polling station is.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people think you can only vote if you have your polling card, but that’s not true either. We’ll be telling people that they are registered, and all they need to do is to turn up at the right polling station on election day,” she said.</p>

      <p>“Another vulnerable group who have previously not registered to vote are people who want to remain anonymous, perhaps they are fleeing domestic violence, and are worried about being on a register.</p>
      <p>“There are new rules allowing people to register and stay anonymous, so we will be helping with that too,” she added.</p>
