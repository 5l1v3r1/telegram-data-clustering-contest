        <b>Defending champions Saracnes have been fined by the EPCR for failing to send representatives to the launch of this season's Heineken Champions Cup in Cardiff. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Neither head coach Mark McCall nor captain Brad Barritt were present after it was previously indicated they would be there.</p>
      <p>Saracens' no-show came a day after they had been fined £5m and <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/european-champions-saracens-docked-35-premiership-points-fined-5-million-salary-cap-breaches-921562">docked 35 points</a> for breaching the Gallagher Premiership's salary cap over the course of three seasons.</p>
      <p>The reigning Premiership champions have since confirmed they <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/saracens-confirm-wont-appealing-salary-cap-punishment-926318">will accept</a> that salary cap deduction and fine.</p>
      <p>An EPCR statement says that in light of Sarries' breach of media rules, it's been decided to impose a fine on the club, which has already been paid.</p>
      <p>The exact sum will remain undisclosed.</p>
      <p>Saracens opened their 2019-20 Heineken Champions Cup Pool 4 campaign with a 30-10 defeat to Racing 92 last week.</p>
      <p>They're at home to Ospreys this weekend, before back-to-back games with Munster in December.</p>
      <p>The EPCR statement in full reads:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Saracens have accepted that they breached the 2019/20 Heineken Champions Cup Participation Agreement by not making the required club representatives available for a key EPCR promotional event.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>On Wednesday, 6 November 2019, Saracens’ Director of Rugby, Mark McCall, and captain, Brad Barritt, did not attend the official Season Launch of the 2019/20 Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge Cup for Premiership and PRO14 clubs which was being staged at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Having previously indicated that they would be represented at the event, Saracens’ failure to attend constituted a breach of the 2019/20 Heineken Champions Cup Media Rules, and compromised EPCR’s ability to deliver the rights contracted to its broadcast, commercial and media partners.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>In light of this breach of its rules, EPCR has decided to impose a fine on Saracens which has been paid by the club, and the sum of which will remain undisclosed.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>EPCR appreciates the subsequent efforts made by Saracens to grant rights-holding broadcasters special interview access to members of their Heineken Champions Cup squad in the week before the start of the tournament.</i>
