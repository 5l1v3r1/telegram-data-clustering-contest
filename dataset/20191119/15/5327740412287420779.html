      <h1>Ottawa urges CN and union to continue talks as 3,200 workers go on strike</h1>
      <h2>The rail workers began their strike after failing to reach a deal by a midnight deadline</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:40:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>The federal government urged Canadian National Railway Co. and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference to continue negotiating as roughly 3,200 conductors, trainpersons and yard workers went on strike.</p>
      <p>Labour Minister Patty Hajdu says the government is concerned about the impact of a work stoppage on Canadians, but remains hopeful the two sides will reach an agreement.</p>
      <p>The rail workers began their strike after failing to reach a deal by a midnight deadline.</p>
      <p>Union spokesman Christopher Monette says they are still in talks with CN in hopes of reaching a negotiated settlement and ending the labour dispute as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The union has said passenger rail services in the country’s three biggest cities would not be affected by the strike.</p>
      <p>The workers, who have been without a contract since July 23, say they’re concerned about long hours, fatigue and what they consider dangerous working conditions.</p>
      <p>The dispute comes as CN confirmed last week that it was cutting jobs across the railway as it deals with a weakening North American economy that has eroded demand.</p>
