      <h1>Amazon Fire TV Blaster brings voice control to your TV for $35</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:50:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Brad Linder</a></address>
      <p>Amazon’s latest Fire TV gadget combines is a $35 gadget called the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XtdDej"><b>Fire TV Blaster</b></a>, and while the name makes it sound like some sort of gaming accessory, it’s really an add-on that lets you use your voice to control a TV, cable box, soundbar, and other accessories.</p>
      <p>Designed to be used with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2O1ZYrO"><b>Fire TV</b></a> device and an <a href="https://amzn.to/2QExNRv"><b>Amazon Echo device</b></a>, it’s basically a cheaper alternative to buying a $120 <a href="https://amzn.to/34c6NNb"><b>Fire TV Cube</b></a> for folks that already have one or more of each. If you don’t, you’re probably better off just buying the Cube.</p>
      <p>Both solutions (Fire TV Cube or Fire TV Blaster + Echo + Fire TV) provide hands-free voice controls for your TV and other media center devices.</p>

      <p>They do that by combining modern features (like the Alexa voice service), with old… kind of cludgy tech (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_blaster">IR blaster</a>).</p>
      <p>Basically the blaster acts like a remote control. It translates your voice commands into infrared signals that it beams to your TV or other devices. So it needs to be set up in a way that allows a line of sight between the Fire TV Blaster and your TV and other gear. Amazon recommends placing it 1-2 feet away from the devices you want to control, with the LED display facing you.</p>
      <p>But that does mean that once everything is set up, you don’t need to use different remotes for all your gear — in fact you don’t need a remote at all. You can just use your voice.</p>
      <p>In terms of tech specs, the Fire TV Blaster measures about 2.2″ x 1.5″ x 1.5″ and comes with an IR extender cable, a micro USB cable for charging, and a 5W power adapter. It supports dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi and it’s compatible with</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fire TV Stick (2nd-gen or later w/Alexa Voice remote)</li>
        <li>Fire TV Stick 4K</li>
        <li>Fire TV (3rd-gen)</li>
        <li>Fire TV Cube (1st and 2nd-gen, but I don’t know why you’d use it with one)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the Fire TV Blaster alone sells for $35, Amazon also offers a <b>Blaster + Fire TV Stick 4K + Echo Dot bundle</b> for $135… but it’s <a href="https://amzn.to/35lbnc1">on sale for $80</a> at the moment.</p>
      <p>The Fire TV and the bundle are both expected to ship December 11th, 2019.</p>
