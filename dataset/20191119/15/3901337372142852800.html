      <p>The two upcoming Bafana Bafana's Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches have been confirmed by the South African Football Association.   </p>
      <p>Following their 1-0 win over Sudan at the weekend, after the 2-0 defeat against Ghana in the opening match of their qualifying campaign at the Cape Coast Stadium last Thursday, Bafana have moved to second place in Group C of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers.  </p>

      <p>Ghana are at the top of the standings with six points, following their successive wins against Bafana and São Tomé respectively. </p>
      <p>“After two matches played, the 2021 AFCON qualifiers will take a break and resume in 2020. Bafana Bafana will be involved in back to back clashes against Sao Tome – the first match will be away at the end of August, followed almost immediately by the home leg early in September. During that period, Ghana will host Sudan and then travel for the away leg. It is almost certain that after this stage, it will become clearer as to who will book their place in Cameroon,” confirmed SAFA on their official website. </p>

      <p>“In October, South Africa will host Ghana, and will then be away to Sudan in November for the final match of the qualifiers. Only the top two teams in the group will qualify,” SAFA added, in confirming the rest of the fixtures.    </p>
