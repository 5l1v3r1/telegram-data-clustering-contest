      <p>Though family restaurant Golden Parachute closed its Williamsville storefront in September, its catering department is growing to include a training program for homeless single parents.</p>
      <p>For 29 years, Tony and Judy Palmisano operated Golden Parachute, a restaurant that was like an extension of their kitchen for a generation of Willamsville residents.</p>
      <p>Over the decades, the chicken soup, pancake, salad and turkey sandwich needs of Main Street were met by the tiny 40-seat space at 5735 Main St.</p>
      <p>That era ended in September, when the Palmisanos retired. The space will become a tea shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Crave-Bubble-Tea-Cafe-115493089888079/">Crave Bubble Tea Cafe</a>.</p>
      <p>But Golden Parachute name will live on, through its robust catering business, taken over by son Philip Palmisano.</p>
      <p>Its new address will be 2515 Bailey Ave., at <a href="https://gerardplace.org/">Gerard Place</a>, the <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/09/09/gleaming-new-gerard-place-center-offers-host-of-neighborhood-services/">recently renovated community center</a>. Palmisano said he’s working with the center, which has a commercial kitchen, to offer food service training to people who want to join the restaurant workforce. Gerard Place offers support for single-parent families, including education, child care and job skills training</p>
      <p>"We do a dining hall on Monday and Wednesday, from four to six that Phil's going to be involved in, a healthy meal in partnership with Friends of the Night People," said David Zapfel, chief executive officer of Gerard Place. "Phil is going to help us really use these fruits and vegetables and all these healthy meals and then teach not only people to maybe be in the culinary careers, but also the whole community."</p>
      <p>At Gerard Place, Palmisano will help coordinate Gerard Place’s community meals, and operate the catering company, while tutoring job-seekers in culinary and catering skills.</p>
      <p>“It's a bit of a transition, but I'm excited,” Palmisano said. “I like the adult educational aspect, and being able to help these people learn the skills that they need.” With the busy catering season, ahead, he said, there’s plenty of work to be done.</p>
      <p>Catering customers can still find the same offerings on the company’s website, <a href="http://www.goldenparachutecatering.com/Golden_Parachute_Website/Welcome.html">goldenparachutecatering.com</a>.</p>
