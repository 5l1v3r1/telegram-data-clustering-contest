        <b>Leke Baiyewu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The minority caucus of House of Representatives has rejected the outcome of the elections held in Kogi and Bayelsa States on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, who led the leadership of the caucus to address journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, said the elections, comprising governorship and senatorial, were marred by violence, rigging and other irregularities.</p>
      <p>“We are 100 per cent not in support of the outcome of the elections,” Elumelu stated.</p>
      <p>The Minority Leader lamented that Senator Dino Melaye lost his nephew to the rerun in Kogi-West senatorial district, an indication that the exercise was marred by violence.</p>
      <p>Candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Yahaya Bello and David Lyon, have been declared the winners of the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States respectively.</p>
