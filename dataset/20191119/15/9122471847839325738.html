      <p>U.S. Olympic track and field athlete Harrison Dillard passed away over the weekend at the age of 96. It’s unfortunate news for the entire sports world as he was once regarded as the “World’s Fastest Man.”</p>
      <p>Dillard was dominant in his field, winning four Olympic gold medals and breaking nearly a dozen world records during his career.</p>
      <p>He earned his nickname the “World’s Fastest Man” after finishing first in the 100-meter dash during the 1948 Olympics. During that event he also won the 110-meter hurdles.</p>
      <p>Ted Theodore, a close friend of Dillard’s, said the cause of his death was his stomach cancer.</p>
      <p>Dillard was the oldest-living U.S. Olympic champion.</p>
      <p>Team USA released a brief statement on the news, saying “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of four-time Olympic champion Harrison Dillard.” </p>

      <p>In addition to being an exceptional athlete, Dillard also served in the U.S. Army for nearly three years.</p>
      <p>There weren’t many things that Dillard didn’t accomplish over the course of his career. He was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame and U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>Dillard also worked for the Cleveland Indians in the scouting department later in his life.</p>
      <p>Our thoughts are with Dillard’s loved ones during this difficult time.</p>
