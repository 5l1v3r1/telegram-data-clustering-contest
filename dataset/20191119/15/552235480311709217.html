      <p>Hibs won’t be a making a move to bring defender Efe Ambrose back to the club.</p>
      <p>The Nigeria international had been linked with a return to Easter Road, with St Johnstone also interested in the former Celtic man.</p>
      <p>But it’s understood that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">the Hibees</a> have no plans to re-sign <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/efe-ambrose">Ambrose</a> , who has been without a club since the summer after leaving Derby County.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old departed Leith last January after exercising a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave on a free with six months remaining on his deal.</p>
      <p>Ambrose initially joined Hibs on loan from Celtic in February 2016, linking up with his former Parkhead boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>.</p>
      <p>Upon the expiry of his Celtic contract that summer, he penned a two-year, permanent deal under Lennon.</p>

      <p>A popular figure amongst supporters during his loan spell, Ambrose incurred Lennon’s wrath after failing to report back to training in time for pre-season, having been given an extended break.</p>
      <p>The centre back made 86 appearances in green and white, scoring six goals before signing for Derby County on a short-term basis following a successful trial.</p>
      <p>Prior to signing on in the East Midlands though, Ambrose was in line for a dramatic deadline day return to Hibs just weeks after leaving, but the capital club pulled the plug on a six-month deal due to wage demands.</p>
      <p>The freed him up to join Derby the following month, but he failed to make a single first team appearance for the Rams under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>They reached the play-off final but missed out on promotion to the English Premier League after a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa at Wembley, with Ambrose’s former Hibs teammate John McGinn heading the winner.</p>
      <p>The news could be of significance to St Johnstone, with manager Tommy Wright admitting he’s keen to add some experience to his back line.</p>
