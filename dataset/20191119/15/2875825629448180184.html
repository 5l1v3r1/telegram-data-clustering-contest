      <p>Jacqueline Jossa is kitted out in her jungle gear while she battles the bugs in the I'm A Celeb camp.</p>
      <p>This is the former soap star's first stint on reality TV, although she is married to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> of The Only Way Is Essex fame.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline, 27, made her name in the spotlight on EastEnders' Albert Square when she looked youthful at the age of 18.</p>
      <p>The stunning actress walked in the heels of character Lauren Branning for seven years.</p>
      <p>Former soap star Jacqueline left behind her post on EastEnders in 2017 and two years later she now has a starring role on I'm A Celeb.</p>

      <p>The reality star transformed her figure after she gave birth to her second daughter Mia, now one, last year.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb's Jacqueline shed one stone and a half as she credited a shake meal replacement plan for the incredible weight loss.</p>
      <p>She previously told fans on social media: "Before I had Mia in between Ella and Mia I was the biggest I have ever been.</p>

      <p>"Then I got pregnant and so I decided that I wanted to change as soon as I had Mia I thought I'm not going to let myself go. I thought I really want to get back to a comfortable weight where I feel good where I feel confident.</p>
      <p>"And I'm still on my journey but I'm already feeling so much better I've lost a stone and a half.</p>
      <p>"I do feel comfortable and I maybe want to lose a little bit more and I want to tone up as well. But I just feel so much better."</p>
      <p>Husband Dan has been left in charge of their two daughters Ella, four, and Mia.</p>
