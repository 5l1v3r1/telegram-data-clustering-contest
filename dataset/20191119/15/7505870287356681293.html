      <p>It seems like Amazon has released about a zillion new products this year, but somehow the company’s not finished just yet. In fact, the new gadget Amazon just unveiled might be one of the coolest products it has launched all year. It’s called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B075F9PYGR?tag=b0c55-20">Fire TV Blaster</a>, and it allows you to control your TV, soundbar, and all the rest of your home entertainment gear with your voice using Alexa commands! It’s awesome, and it’s available for preorder right now for just $34.99!</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know from the product page:</p>
      <ul>
