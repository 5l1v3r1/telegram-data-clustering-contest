      <p>A Royal Air Force pilot has been cleared of attempting to kill his squadron leader girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Flight Lieutenant Timothy Barry was also accused of grievous bodily harm with intent following a night out with Squadron Leader Sarah Seddon to celebrate her return from a three-month tour of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>A jury took two hours to clear him of both those charges.</p>
      <p>Flt Lt Barry, who is based at RAF Benson, had earlier pled guilty to an assault charge, for which he will be sentenced next month.</p>
      <p>Following Tuesday's verdict, an RAF spokesperson said: "The RAF will consider the court’s findings, however, it would be inappropriate for the RAF to comment while legal proceedings are on-going."</p>
