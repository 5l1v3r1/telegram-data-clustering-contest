      <p>An international medical relief agency says it has reopened a hospital it runs in western Yemen two weeks after an attack damaged the facility.<br/><br/>Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, announced resuming work at its hospital in the Red Sea city of Mocha on Tuesday.<br/><br/>The Houthi rebels launched a drone and missile attack earlier this month that targeted buildings near the hospital, killing at least eight people.<br/><br/>The causalities did not include any patients at the MSF hospital, all of whom were transferred to other care facilities in Mocha after the attack.<br/><br/>The hospital was first opened in August last year, offering free services to thousands of war-wounded people.<br/><br/>YemenÂ´s war pits Iran-backed Houthi rebels against the internationally recognized government, supported by a Saudi-led military coalition since March 2015.</p>
