        <li>One of the most disappointing aspects of the service is that you can’t see what movies or shows you’ve started or finished. This makes it difficult to know which episode of a show you’re on, for example.</li>
        <li>Disney told Business Insider it would launch a “continue watching” feature soon, but there’s no timetable yet.</li>

      <p>After years of anticipation, Disney last week finally released its streaming service, Disney Plus.</p>
      <p><a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_111819_disney-plus-missing-features-cant-see-what-finished-or-started&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> features movies and shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars,” and National Geographic. I personally love it: It has a strong foundation with lots of rewatchable older movies and shows, as well as the promise of new Disney Plus originals on the horizon, like the already excellent series “The Mandalorian.”</p>
      <p>There’s just one glaring issue I’ve found so far: There’s no way to see which movies or shows you’ve started, or finished.</p>
      <p>On Netflix, Disney Plus’ main competition, it’s easy to know this stuff. Netflix offers two carousels toward the top of your home screen, called “continue watching” and “watch it again,” so it’s easy to see what you’ve started and finished.</p>

      <p>Disney told Business Insider that it would continually refine its product and that a “continue watching” feature would launch shortly. Still, we have no idea when it’s coming, or whether viewers will also have the ability to see what they’ve finished watching.</p>
      <p>These are odd omissions for a major streaming service not to have at launch, but given that they’re simple software tweaks, it’s all fixable. Hopefully we see these changes sooner rather than later.</p>
