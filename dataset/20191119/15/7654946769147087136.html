      <p>One of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers claims Jeffrey Epstein’s gal pal Ghislaine Maxwell prowled Central Park to recruit women <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-claims-he-hid-pinhole-cameras-to-monitor-private-moments/">into his sex trafficking ring.</a></p>
      <p>Maria Farmer, who alleges the duo sexually assaulted her in 1996, said she watched Maxwell approach young women after being recruited herself to work for the financier pedophile.</p>
      <p>“I saw Ghislaine going to get the women. She went to places like Central Park,” said Farmer <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-maria-farmer-says-ghislaine-maxwell-threatened-her-life-after-assault-fbi-failed/">during her first TV interview Tueday on “CBS This Morning</a>.</p>
      <p>One some occasions, Maxwell would jump out of the car in an attempt to lure a potential victim for Epstein, she said.</p>
      <p>“She would say, ‘Stop the car.’ And she would dash out and get a child,” Farmer claimed.</p>
      <p>When questioned about what she was doing, Maxwell told her that she was “getting Victoria’s Secret models.”</p>
      <p>Epstein was accused of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/14/inside-the-victorias-secret-pipeline-to-jeffrey-epstein/">touting his ties to Victoria’s Secret owner</a> Les Wexner to lure aspiring models to his homes.</p>

      <p>Farmer said Epstein boasted about his relationship with Wexner, claiming the mogul would “do anything for him.”</p>
      <p>“He bragged about it,” Farmer said.</p>
      <p>Farmer claimed that she was sexually assaulted by the pedophile when she was 26 and worked for him at the front desk of his Upper East Side townhouse.</p>
      <p>During her time at the pad, Farmer said she saw young women there “all day long.”</p>
      <p>“I saw many, many, many, many, many,” she said.</p>
      <p>Farmer <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/epstein-accuser-says-ghislaine-maxwell-made-death-threat-after-she-reported-abuse/">sued Epstein’s estate</a> along with co-accusers Annie Farmer — her younger sister — and Teresa Helm for $557 million in damages, citing battery and emotional distress.</p>
      <p>Maxwell’s lawyers previously declined to comment on Farmer’s suit, while Wexner has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/10/billionaire-behind-victorias-secret-embarrassed-by-epstein-ties/">condemned Epstein’s behavior as “abhorrent”</a> and claimed the financier took advantage of him.</p>
