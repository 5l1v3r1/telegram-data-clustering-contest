        <li>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/youtube">YouTube</a> video recently spotted by The Loop's Dave Mark gives a tour of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/apple">Apple's</a> "spaceship" headquarters in Cupertino, California.</li>
        <li>The campus was finished in 2018 and cost about $5 billion to construct.</li>
        <li>Most of it is closed to the public, except for the visitor center and the Steve Jobs Theater, where press events are held.</li>

      <p>Apple Park, the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California, that was completed last year, has a circular, futuristic design that's instantly recognizable and often called the "spaceship."</p>
      <p>The public rarely gets to see inside, though, and visitors are allowed only in certain areas.</p>
      <p>But an August video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChtB50MUCUHjh0c1vcmtw0g">a YouTube user named Yongsung Kim</a> recently <a href="https://twitter.com/davemark/status/1196795510713131008">spotted by The Loop's executive editor, Dave Mark</a>, gives the rest of us a chance to see inside Apple's famed headquarters.</p>

      <p>The headquarters, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-park-spaceship-campus-2-finished-results-photos-2018-1">which cost Apple $5 billion</a>, has a visitor center and store for tourists looking to check out the campus or buy official Apple apparel and merchandise available only there.</p>
      <p>The Steve Jobs Theater, a circular building next to the "spaceship" portion of the campus, offers 360-degree views thanks to its all-glass walls. A marble staircase inside leads to an underground auditorium, where at least once a year reporters are invited to see the next Apple products announced.</p>
      <p>The large, doughnut-shaped ring of Apple Park is the main building where some 12,000 employees work.</p>
      <p>The campus is also eco-friendly, blurring the line between indoors and outdoors with four-story glass windows, large orchards that supply fruit for the cafeterias, and solar panels on the roof.</p>
      <p>The building is even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-park-spaceship-campus-floats-to-protect-against-earthquakes-2019-6">designed to resist earthquakes</a>, according to Jony Ive, Apple's former design chief, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/apple-headquarters-earthquake-preparedness.html">told The New York Times in June</a> that he and former CEO Steve Jobs considered natural-disaster protection essential.</p>
