      <h1>Arizona Man to Plead Guilty to Illegally Making Ammunition Bought by Las Vegas Shooter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:49:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(LAS VEGAS) — An Arizona man is due to plead guilty to illegally manufacturing tracer and armor-piercing bullets found in a high-rise hotel suite where a gunman took aim before the Las Vegas Strip massacre two years ago.</p>
      <p>Douglas Haig isn’t accused of a direct role in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting that killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an open-air music festival. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.</p>
      <p>Haig is a 57-year-old aerospace engineer who used to reload bullets at home in Mesa, Arizona, and sell them at gun shows.</p>
      <p>His plea expected Tuesday will avoid a trial and mean he can’t possess guns or ammunition.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Marc Victor maintained that Haig couldn’t get a fair trial before a jury in trauma-scarred Las Vegas.</p>
