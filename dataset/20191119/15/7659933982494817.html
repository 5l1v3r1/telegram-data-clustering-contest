      <p>An Israeli policeman is to be indicted for "manslaughter" over the killing of a young man of Ethiopian origin in June, an incident that sparked widespread protests, police said Tuesday.<br/><br/>Solomon Teka, 19, was killed by an unnamed off-duty policeman in Kiryat Haim, near the northern port city of Haifa on June 30.<br/><br/>Teka's death sparked three days of nationwide protests that were often violent over longstanding grievances of Ethiopian-Israelis, who say they are discriminated against and targeted by police.<br/><br/>The policeman, who was placed under house arrest in the weeks following the killing, is accused of manslaughter, according to the findings of a police investigation.<br/><br/>"He used his weapon in a way that put the victim's life in danger," the findings said.<br/><br/>"He did not just fire a warning shot in the air to neutralise the danger he faced."<br/><br/>Initially, the police reported that the policeman had come across a fight between young men and had tried to intervene.<br/><br/>After the officer identified himself, the youths threw stones at him and he opened fire after feeling his life was in danger, the police statement said.<br/><br/>But the other young men and a passer-by said the policeman was not attacked, Israeli media reported.<br/><br/>"The policeman involved in the incident has been relieved of his duties in the police force," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Tuesday, indicating the killing was not motivated by racism.<br/><br/>There are some 140,000 Ethiopian-Israelis, of whom around 50,000 were born in the Jewish state. They are Jewish, but say they are in many cases still seen as outsiders.<br/><br/>Most are descendants of communities cut off from the Jewish world for centuries, who were belatedly recognised as Jews by Israeli religious authorities.<br/><br/>Israel took in tens of thousands of them in the 1980s and 1990s.<br/><br/>The community has consistently complained of institutionalised racism.<br/><br/>Thousands of Ethiopian-Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv in January after a young community member was shot dead by a police officer when he allegedly rushed at him holding a knife.</p>
