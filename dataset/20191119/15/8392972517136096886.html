      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> are complaining about Kate Garraway's bunches.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> presenter has sported the hairstyle over the past couple of days during challenges and her first Bushtucker trial last night.</p>
      <p>However, the bunches aren't going down well with some viewers who told Kate to ditch the hairdo on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Last night, Kate took on her first Bushtucker trial alongside American TV star Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>The pair were strapped down inside transparent boxes, which were then lifted in the air.</p>

      <p>They had to chuck a ball into a moving bucket below them and had 10 minutes to try and get as many as they could.</p>
      <p>The pair were joined by a number of critters in the box as well as rats.</p>
      <p>They managed to get two balls each into the buckets, meaning they had four meals in total.</p>

      <p>The campmates in Croc Creek had to decide who they wanted to join them and they chose Kate, meaning Caitlyn went back to the less-than-luxury camp.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tonight on ITV at 9pm.</p>
