      <p>You’re in a Skype call, and you get told you can’t be heard – or if you are coming through, it sounds like you’re using a tin can on a string. It’s something that happens to even professional streamers.</p>
      <p>It could be that you’ve got a good quality headset plugged in, but for some reason your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_test-microphone-on-windows-10&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fwindows-10-home-english-windows%2F6121415.p%3FskuId%3D6121415">Windows</a> laptop’s trying to record using its awful built-in microphone.

      <h3>How to test your microphone in Windows 10</h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> At the bottom-right of the screen, in your taskbar, find the tiny icon that looks like a speaker. You might need to click on the icon that looks like an up arrow, which will show you icons that have been hidden from your taskbar.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>3.</b> Scroll down to “Input.” Windows will show you which microphone is currently your default – in other words, which one it’s using right now – and a blue bar showing your volume levels. Try talking into your microphone. If the blue bar jumps around as you raise and lower your voice, that means it’s working correctly.</p>

      <p><b>4.</b> If your computer is using the wrong microphone, you can change it by clicking on the drop-down menu and selecting a new option – make sure the right microphone is plugged in correctly, or it won’t appear.</p>
