      <p>Iconic artist <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/revok">REVOK</a> is set to release a new print entitled ‘Loop_Magenta_Umarine_2a’ on Louis Buhl &amp; Co.’s editions platform. The artwork draws inspiration from original pieces observed in the artist’s most recent exhibition, “Depersonalization – Derealization,” which has been developed using handmade spray can machines. “I try to create vibrating energy, a meditation object for internal reflection. As miserable and awful as everything seems, I try to find some comfort in my art. The tools were the initial inspiration, but the works have become something else,” said the artist.</p>
