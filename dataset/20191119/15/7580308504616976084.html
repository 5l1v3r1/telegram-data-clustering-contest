      <p>The police on Tuesday arraigned two minors and a 22-year-old man, Muhammad Mustapha at the Karu Grade I Area Court, Abuja for allegedly stealing soft drinks worth N48,000.</p>
      <p>The police charged the defendants with three counts of joint acts, criminal trespass and theft.</p>
      <p>They, however, denied committing the offence.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution Counsel, Vincent Osuji, told the court that the complainant, Mrs Mary Ogobuegu, reported the matter at the Karu Police Station on Nov 9.</p>
      <p>“Ogobuegwu alleged that the defendants conspired among themselves, trespassed into her business premises and stole some soft drinks.</p>
      <p>“The drinks include 16 packs of pet gold drink, five packets of mama Big Coke, Energy drinks and two packs of 5alive, all valued at N48,000.</p>
      <p>“During (the) police investigation, some of the stolen drinks were recovered,” Osuji said.</p>
      <p>He said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 79, 348 and 287 of the Penal Code.</p>
      <p>The Judge, Abdullahi Jibrin, ordered the defendants to produce one surety each who must be a civil servant and adjourned the case until Nov. 27 for hearing.</p>
