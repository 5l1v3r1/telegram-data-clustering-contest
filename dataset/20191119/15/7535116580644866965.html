      <p>For parents who have toddlers or babies, a child’s safety seat is probably not something you would want to skimp on. After all, children who aren’t properly fastened into their seats can wind up seriously hurt during an accident. In some cases, they can be what separates life from death.</p>
      <p>But as you can probably imagine,<b> children’s safety seats aren’t exactly cheap to buy</b>, with some of them easily reaching some pretty high prices whether you’re buying them online or in retail stores.</p>

      <p>Well apparently, even thieves are becoming increasingly aware of how much these children’s safety seats are worth and have taken it upon themselves to steal them, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/anissyazwanie/status/1195999774148706304">this viral Twitter post</a>!</p>
      <p>Posted by netizen @anissyazwanie who also goes by Anis Jasmani, she shares her experience of coming back to her own car, <b>only to find that thieves had broken into it by shattering her windows!</b></p>

      <p>Now, while that isn’t something unheard of, what is truly odd and perhaps even infuriating is the fact that the thieves not only dismantled and stole Anis’ car stereo,<b> they even went to the extent of removing her baby’s safety seat from her back seat to steal it too!</b></p>
      <blockquote>Her Tweet reads: “I just have to be patient. If any of you see someone selling a pre-loved car seat branded Chicco Next Fit, grey in colour, especially in the Johor Bharu area, please do inform me.<br/>If you want to steal from me, that’s fine. But what pissed me off is that they stole from my child.”</blockquote>

      <p>This comes after the fact that the government is trying to urge more private cars to install child safety seats in their vehicles to ensure the safety of children in the event of car accidents. In which case, how are parents going to stop thieves from trying to steal the seats themselves?</p>
      <p>
        <i>We definitely hope that the authorities will look into the theft and hold those who are guilty accountable! </i>
