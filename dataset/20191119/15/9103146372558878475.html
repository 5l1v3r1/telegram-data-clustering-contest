      <p><i> <br/></i><b>Episcopal service</b><br/>The House of Bishops elected Rev. Ojwang as the second Anglican bishop of the Diocese of Kitgum in 2002. He served during the heights of the bloody war in northern Uganda, which was waged by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) under the command of Joseph Kony.<br/><br/>Ojwang served for 11 years but was forcefully retired before he had clocked the official mandatory age of 65 after a group of Christians purportedly plotted against him and his leadership in the diocese.<br/><br/>“Ojwang was a man who loved peace. He would ask for forgiveness where he was wrong and was always willing to reconcile with his enemies. He was a good preacher of the gospel of Christ. He loved singing. He especially enjoyed the set Anglican hymns and the Acholi traditional tunes. He also enjoyed the traditional Acholi vibes and dances such as <i>Bwola</i> royal dance and <i>Laraka-raka</i>,” said Bishop Gakumba.<br/><br/>According to Gakumba, Ojwang was ordained in 1970 in the diocese of Masenu, in Kenya, where he had fled to save his life, during the bloody regime of Idd Amin after completing his studies in Theology from Bishop Tucker Theological College, Mukono. He returned to Gulu in 1980.<br/><br/>Before becoming Bishop of Northern Uganda, Ojwang served as the Vicar of Christ Parish (in Gulu Municipality), which was under Gulu Urban Archdeaconry.<br/><br/>Ojwang is survived by a widow, Margaret Akullu Ojwang, eight children (five boys and three girls), and 20 grand-children.</p>
