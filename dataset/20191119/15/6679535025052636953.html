      <p>MADURAI</p>
      <p>Students of Annai Sathya Government Home no longer have to tediously walk around 7 km every day to and from their school in Chokkikulam.</p>
      <p>Collector T.G. Vinay has requested the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) to start a private bus service for the students. The service would likely start on Thursday, he told <i>The Hindu</i> as the proposal had been submitted to the Managing Director of TNSTC.</p>
      <p>The bus in two shifts will ply from Annai Sathya Government Home through Collector Office Road in Tallakulam to Kakkai Padiniyar Corporation Girls’ School on Besant Road, Chokkikulam. The students will be picked up at 8.30 a.m. and dropped back at 5.50 p.m., the Collector said.</p>
      <p>The news at the home was met with joy and excitement among teachers and wardens who said that this had been a 25-year-long wait.</p>
      <p>Currently, 27 students from primary school, middle school, high school and higher secondary school walk all the way from Tallakulam to the school by navigating heavy traffic on Gokhale Road and Dr. Ambedkar Salai.</p>
      <p>A teacher wishing anonymity said that abandoned children, children of single parents and those whose parents are jailed, make up most of the population and are barely used to such luxuries. Until 2016, 110 children stayed in the cramped space, the teacher said.</p>
      <p>“Now, however, our sanctioned strength is 35 and we have 27 children. It will soon increase significantly with the new building coming up at a rapid pace,” she said and added that the bus facility would be optimally used by the girls in the home.</p>
      <p>Child Welfare Committee (CWC) member B. Pandiaraja said that the introduction of the bus facility would allow students to have a fresh start when they would go to school instead of being tired early in the morning.</p>
      <p>“If such a proposal is replicated in other major hostels and homes, students will certainly be benefited,” he said.</p>
