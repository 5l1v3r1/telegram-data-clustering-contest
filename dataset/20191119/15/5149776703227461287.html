      <h2>An animal rights group wants to encourage people to switch to cruelty-free knits</h2>

      <p>A Christmas jumper that is unlike anything you've seen has gone on sale.</p>
      <p>An animal rights group has revealed its festive sweater for 2019, which features 3D 'bruised and bloodied' sheep.</p>
      <p>The plush animals appear to burst through the green and red jumper, says <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/peta-christmas-wool-sheep-jumper-17280585">NorthWalesLive</a> .</p>
      <p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal (PETA) says it hopes the design will shock Christmas revellers into ditching wool in their clothes and homes.</p>
      <p>The controversial group calls the look “a show-stopping, conversation-starting” design.</p>

      <p>Featuring the words “Wool Hurts” on the front, PETA says wearers can “join in on the holiday fun while making a statement for animals.”</p>
      <p>However the price tag is an eye-watering $149.99 from PETA USA – though it can be ordered internationally.</p>
      <p>Available in one size, it’s made in Germany using 100% acrylic yarn.</p>
      <p>The PETA sweater forms part of the group’s investigative campaigning: since 2014, the group says it has released 11 exposés of 99 wool-industry facilities on four continents, including in the UK.</p>
      <p>A description on the PETA website reads: “This is part of PETA's campaign against the wool industry, where workers have been caught beating, kicking, stomping on, and even killing gentle sheep in shearing sheds.</p>
      <p>“With the help of celebrities such as Billie Eilish and P!nk, PETA is calling on shoppers (and retailers) to help sheep by switching to cruelty-free knits.”</p>
