      <h1>Did Apple Maps Forget Michigan’s Upper Peninsula?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:57:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>The upgraded Apple Maps has been slowly rolling out across the United States this year. The team recently added some western and midwestern states to the redesign, including the lower peninsula of Michigan. But I live in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and don’t see the upgrade. No surprise there, because people often think the U.P. is part of <a href="https://www.dailypress.net/news/community/2019/08/mountain-dew-creates-u-p-bottles/">Canada or Wisconsin.</a> There’s even an <a href="https://reddit.com/r/mapswithoutUP">entire subreddit</a> dedicated to it. Since it looks like Wisconsin hasn’t gotten the upgrade either, I’m assuming Apple is in the latter camp.</p>
      <blockquote>In terms of area, this latest expansion is Apple’s largest yet……and it’s the second largest in terms of population. It also has arrived faster than almost all of the others.</blockquote>
