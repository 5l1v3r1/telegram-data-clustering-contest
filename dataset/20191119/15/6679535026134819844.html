      <p>The extension arm of the 18th channel was started in 2016 following representation from a section of farmers in Uthamapalayam and Bodinayakknur taluks and was completed in March 2018 at a cost of â‚¹48 crore for a length of 14.10 kilometres from Sudhagangai Odai near Renganathapuram village in Thevaram to Koovalinga river and ultimately it joins the Kottakudi river. The water will benefit seven tanks including Kattabommankulam, Kottaikulam, Kamarajabalasamudrakulam, Vannar oorani, Soolapuram kulam, Paaraikulam and Koppan oorani, apart from recharging 585 wells in Thevaram, Pottipuram, Rasingapuram, Silamalai, Melachokkanathapuram and Bodinayakkanur. A total of 4794.71 acres of land will receive irrigation through the release.</p>
