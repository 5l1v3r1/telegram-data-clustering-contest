      <p>Georgia photographer Chamberlain Smith was hit hard on the sideline of the Bulldogs’ game at Auburn on Saturday. Smith was taken off the field on a stretcher and transported to the hospital in a scary moment. Thankfully, she’s since been released.</p>
      <p>Smith shared on Twitter this morning the photo she took right before the collision on the sideline with Georgia running back Brian Herrien.</p>
      <p>“For those of you asking if I got ‘the’ shot, here it is!! The last thing my camera &amp; I saw before being tackled,” she tweeted.</p>
      <p>It’s a great shot:</p>

      <p>Herrien is a fan of it:</p>
      <p>“You’re the best, I knew it would be a good picture,” Herrien tweeted.</p>

      <p>Smith shared an update on her status on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I’m so glad to be walking away with nothing more than a concussion and some bruises,” she wrote in a Twitter post. “I will be home resting and recovering for the next several days, but look forward to being back on the sidelines soon!”</p>
