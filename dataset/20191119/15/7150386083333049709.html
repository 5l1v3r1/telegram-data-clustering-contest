      <p>Tonight’s episode of <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/kbc/"><b><i>Kaun Banega Crorepati 11</i></b></a> opens to megastar-host Amitabh Bachchan introducing contestant Jitender Singh Chauhan. Born in Mainpuri village of Uttar Pradesh, Jitender has been brought up in New Delhi. He is currently pursuing the CA course and also runs coaching classes. He teaches accounts in a coaching center and also has his own coaching classes called “Coaching for Careers” where 40-50 students study. In his video, Jitender is heard sharing his story of hard work and inhuman hours of studying. He is also heard saying that “making a girlfriend is a waste of time.” Amitabh takes him through the rules of the game before introducing him to the expert for the night.</p>

      <p>Lightening up the mood, Amitabh points out to the statement made by Jitender in his video where he said, “Making a girlfriend is a waste of time.” Pulling his leg, Amitabh asks him why he said that as it was a disrespect to the women watching the show. Jitender says that he will consider changing his opinion now that the megastar has pointed out. Jitender asks Big B if the scene from his movie Sooryavansham where he sings and puts a baby to sleep has helped him in real life.
