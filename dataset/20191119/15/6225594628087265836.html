        <b>Apple is set to launch Apple Glasses in 2022 and experts say they could replace the iPhone completely within a decade.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a recent report, Apple aims to launch its augmented-reality headset in 2022, with a “sleeker” pair of AR glasses to follow in 2023.</p>
      <p>Apple is facing a challenge: iPhone sales are in decline. It’s not really Apple’s fault though, the market has become saturated over the last decade. To remedy to this potential loss of revenue, Apple seems to have chosen to invest in smart glasses. Reports confirmed that Apple executives shared two prototypes with employees during an internal presentation in California last month.</p>
      <p>The first model resemble the Facebook Oculus Quest VR headset, with high-res display, cameras mounted on the outside but with a specific camera that allows users to read small type and see other people standing in front and behind virtual objects.</p>
      <p>The second prototype, due to arrive in 2023, will be a “sleeker” pair of AR glasses. Made out of high-quality lightweight materials, these glasses will be built to be comfortable enough to wear for extended periods of time. Of course, this reminds us of Snap’s Spectacles which never really took off. But this is Apple.</p>
      <p>In fact, many experts think the new Apple AR glasses could challenge the supremacy of the iPhone within only a decade after launch.</p>
