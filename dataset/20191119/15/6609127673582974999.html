        <b>A FIVE-A-SIDER was told never to set foot on a football pitch again after he admitted breaking an opponent’s jaw.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Douglas McKerron, 40, was banned from <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4974731/rangers-alfredo-morelos-st-etienne/">the game</a> for a year, when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, and was ordered to pay his victim £1,000.</p>

      <p>Sheriff Andrew Miller took the unusual step and told McKerron, an offshore worker: “When I say that, I mean you are not to take part in any kind of football above kicking a ball about with your children.</p>
      <p>“You need to accept your playing days are over. I strongly advise you never to set foot on a football pitch again.”</p>
      <p>McKerron appeared at the same court in 2011, also for punching a rival.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Miller said: “It seems history has repeated itself. You seem like an upstanding member of the public, except when you step onto a football pitch, when the red mist descends.</p>

      <p>The court heard that in the later attack McKerron was playing for the Cruise Control five-a-side team at Goals Soccer Centre, Aberdeen, on March 26. He punched his opponent to the ground after a flare-up.</p>
      <p>The referee abandoned the match immediately at the site on Great Southern Road, Aberdeen, and told McKerron to leave. McKerron was arrested the next day.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and underwent surgery for a double break in his jaw.</p>
      <p>He was allowed home two days later and spent two weeks off work.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Anna Chisholm told the court the match referee had noticed McKerron “making some heavy tackles” early in the game – and ordered him to leave the pitch for a few minutes to cool down.</p>
      <p>However, he then returned to the field and punched an opponent in the jaw 25 minutes later.</p>
      <p>McKerron, whose address was given in court as Balnagask Road, Aberdeen, admitted assaulting the man by punching him on the face, causing him to fall to the ground to his severe injury.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Peter Shepherd said: “My client has no previous convictions since 2011. Unfortunately for him, that was for the same offence as this.”</p>
      <p>The court heard McKerron admitted at the same court in 2011 punching a man repeatedly to the head to his severe injury at Strikers Indoor Football Centre in Aberdeen in September 2010.</p>
      <p>“I have given careful consideration as to whether to send you to prison and decided I do not need to do that.”</p>
      <p>McKerron was given a 12-month supervision order “to identify the triggers for this kind of behaviour” and ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work and pay £1,000 compensation to his victim.</p>
