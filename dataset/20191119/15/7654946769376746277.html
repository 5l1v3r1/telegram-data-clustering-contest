      <h1>California wildfire victims claim blaze destroyed $280M emerald</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:29:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Lia Eustachewich</a></address>
      <p>A California couple is claiming their $280 million emerald was destroyed in <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/25/deadliest-fire-in-californias-history-is-contained/">the most destructive wildfire in state history</a> last year — but the utility company blamed for sparking the inferno isn’t buying it.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E Corp. said it’s investigating the victims’ “suspicious” claim regarding the lost 500-pound jewel, as well as other “exceptionally large monetary claims,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/pg-e-dubious-of-fire-victim-s-claim-for-500-pound-emerald">Bloomberg reported, citing a court filing.</a></p>
      <p>The utility wants to question the owners of the emerald, who say the pricey bauble was destroyed in last year’s Camp Fire that left 86 people dead and all but wiped out the entire town of Paradise.</p>
      <p>The blaze — sparked by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/15/utility-equipment-sparked-deadly-california-wildfire/">old equipment owned and operated by PG&amp;E</a> — was the deadliest and most destructive in Golden State history, burning through more than 153,300 acres.</p>
      <p>Now, lawyers are working to determine PG&amp;E’s liability in losses related to the fire.</p>
      <p>The couple, who were not identified, want to be reimbursed for the emerald and submitted duplicate claims of $4.5 million, according to the utility, Bloomberg reported.</p>
      <p>But the company wants proof that the owners tried to “secure and protect the emerald and documents showing that the emerald was damaged or destroyed.”</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the committee representing victims slammed the request.</p>
      <p>“Asking these fire victims to produce financial back-up for their claims and be deposed on the details of this backup is unduly burdensome and should not be permitted,” they wrote in a filing.</p>
