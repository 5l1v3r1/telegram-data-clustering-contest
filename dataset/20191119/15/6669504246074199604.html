      <p>BOSTON - A rapid-fire Nerf gun, ice cream-scented Nickelodeon slime and a plastic Power Rangers claw are among the toys making a consumer safety group's annual list of worst toys for the holidays.</p>
      <p>World Against Toys Causing Harm, or WATCH, unveiled its list Tuesday at a Boston children's hospital.</p>
      <p>A realistic toy machine-gun, the Pogo Trick Board, a yeti teddy bear and a pull-along caterpillar toy for infants also made the list.</p>
      <p>The Massachusetts-based non-profit says many of the products present choking, eye and other safety hazards found in poorly designed toys.</p>
      <p>It also cites the products for having inconsistent and inadequate warning labels.</p>
      <p>The industry trade group The Toy Association didnâ€™t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In the past, it has dismissed the list as biased and inaccurate.</p>
