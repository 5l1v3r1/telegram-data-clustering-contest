      <p><b>HONG KONG — </b>Arms covered in cling film and torches in hand as they drop into the sewers, clusters of pro-democracy protesters still inside a Hong Kong campus are plotting increasingly ingenious — and desperate — ways to escape a police siege.<br/><br/>Among the detritus of a scorched and graffiti-sprayed concourse at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, several plastic covers — some with torches placed above them — betray extraordinary underground escape plans.<br/><br/>Protesters have removed metal manholes, some making exploratory forays into the fetid tunnels, following rumors of successful exfiltrations from a campus ringed for three days by baton-wielding police determined to arrest them.<br/><br/>Pockets of protesters, some with thick bandages wrapped around their knees in anticipation of a long crawl to freedom, knot the holes discussing an unlikely — and highly dangerous — breakout.<br/><br/>Reporters saw one group on their stomachs practicing crawling. Another group hugged each other in consolation after apparently agreeing not to take the route down into the unknown.<br/><br/>"The people outside can't help us," a protester told local television as he prepared to descend into a sewer. "So what can we do?"<br/><br/>One protester, gas mask on, and cling film wrapped around his arms, carried a torch as he descended with his backpack down the metal rungs into the subterranean gloom.<br/><br/>Desperation has stalked the protesters for two days since an occupation of the city center campus turned into a police siege.<br/><br/>"We can get through today... I don't know about tomorrow," Fung, 43, a kitchen volunteer helping feed protesters in a campus canteen said on Monday.<br/><br/>So far the daring escape bids have been matched by their danger.<br/><br/>Late on Monday dozens of protesters in civilian clothes slid down several meters of rope onto a flyover, where a cavalcade of motorbikes conducted a smash and grab rescue mission.<br/><br/>Police said 37 of the escapees and bike drivers were later arrested — but many others are thought to have got away.<br/><br/>Earlier Monday scores of protesters faced a gauntlet of batons from Hong Kong's bruising riot cops as they made a dash along another bridge.<br/><br/>Some escaped but images showed those who did not on the receiving end of brutal flurries of baton strikes, kicks and stamps.<br/><br/>On Tuesday a group of around 20 protesters who had moved from the campus into a nearby building overnight slipped away, after riot police left their post.<br/><br/>"It's at most 10 years in jail if I am convicted of rioting," said Issac, aged 17. "But it will be a whole life in a larger prison if I stop coming out."<br/><br/>The teenager said that although his decision to leave would give him "a sense of shame", the remaining protesters needed to split up.<br/><br/>"I knew we couldn't leave together," he said. "But If we all got trapped and arrested, the movement would fail and die because I believe most of the frontliners were on campus."<br/><br/>Under-18s have also been escorted out by teachers — their details taken but not immediately arrested on exit from the campus — while Monday was pock-marked by sporadic failed escape bids by clusters of protesters.<br/><br/>Inside, desolation has replaced defiance.<br/><br/>"Liberty or Death" has been sprayed on the glass entrance to one building, where a 7/11 has been looted and a Bank of China ATM has been smashed up.<br/><br/>Classroom furniture, bottles for petrol bombs, mats, bollards and bins are chaotically piled across the campus, whose walls are scarred by scorch marks from large fires.<br/><br/>Black clothes, the color of a rebellion whose narrow initial aims against a specific law have widened into calls for democracy in Hong Kong, are strewn everywhere as the mainly young activists shed protest 'uniforms' before making a break for it.<br/><br/>A hardcore contingent remains, willing to defend the campus despite stark warnings by police that officers are ready to use lethal force if they come under attack.<br/><br/>Tears in his eyes, exhausted and injured in one leg, Wong explained the dilemma of a youth movement whose lives have been upended by months of protest.<br/><br/>"If I give up can I face those who have sacrificed?" he said, of those arrested in the campus siege.<br/><br/>"I don't mind giving up my future so that others can step on our bodies and keep going forward." — AFP</p>
