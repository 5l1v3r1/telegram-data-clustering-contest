      <h1>Apple hosting special press event in New York to honor best apps and games of 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:59:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author">Edward C. Baig</a></address>
      <p>Apple is hosting a "special event" on Dec. 2 in New York to honor what the company says are "our favorite apps and games" of 2019. The invitation to the press event showcases the App Store icon and includes the tagline "Loved by millions. Created by the best."</p>
      <p>Nothing in the invitation hinted at any new Apple hardware announcements, which would seem to be especially unlikely this late in the year anyhow. But you can never rule out surprises.</p>
      <p>Nor is it clear if CEO Tim Cook will attend the festivities, which went out to select media.</p>
      <p>Most of Apple's past media events have been held in or around the company's Silicon Valley headquarters, though there have been exceptions.</p>
      <p>Apple launched its last few products with relatively minimal fanfare. The company unveiled a new 16-inch MacBook Pro with an improved keyboard only a week ago and AirPods Pro with noise cancellation last month.</p>
