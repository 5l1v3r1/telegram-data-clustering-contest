      <h2>It left her flooring looking brand new and other Mrs Hinch fans seriously impressed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:39:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>A mum has shared a simple and cheap cleaning hack for her carpets which has left people stunned.</p>
      <p>Manda said said her carpet had lost its shine, no matter how much she Hoovered.</p>
      <p>But posting on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/263873787588466/?ref=group_header">Hinch Army Cleaning Tips Facebook page</a> , she explained how a 59p trick left her carpets as good as new - once a giant hairball had been removed, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mrs-hinch-fan-shares-59p-20913225">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She wrote on the popular page: "You lovely Hinchers have done it again. I have a lovely silver grey carpet which lately has become a bit dull and I’m always hoovering but it had lost its lovely look.</p>
      <p>"I saw the post about trapped hair and how hoovering doesn’t get it out. So I bought a squeegee for 59p and gave it a go."</p>
      <p>The results were impressive.</p>
      <p>"This is my daughter's bedroom carpet. She has very long hair. I was totally shocked at how much came up and a bit disgusted to be honest," Manda wrote.</p>

      <p>"My carpet now looks brand new again! If you haven’t tried it yet do it!"</p>
      <p>And hundreds of other Mrs Hinch fans were just as impressed with the tactic.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "I do this every week now. Amazing how much hair and dust comes up. Only thing is my squeegee doesn't last long."</p>
      <p>Another added: "I do my stairs often and the amount that comes off is crazy!"</p>
      <p>There were also tips, to make the job even easier.</p>
      <p>"You can get a rubber brush (Home Bargains) which makes the job much easier," one wrote.</p>
      <p>Another added: "I've also got a hideous pair of rubber sliders that are used specifically for this. They clean the carpet and it's a work out to boot."</p>
