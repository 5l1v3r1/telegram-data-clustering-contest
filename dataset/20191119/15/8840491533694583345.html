      <p>THE government is to invest €145 million to deliver high-speed broadband to 36,360 homes across Mayo.</p>
      <p>Minister Michael Ring today (Tuesday) joined the Taoiseach and other Cabinet Ministers at the signing of the contract for the National Broadband Plan with National Broadband Ireland, the company which will deliver the project.</p>
      <p>Commented Minister Ring: “Today marks a new dawn for the people who live and work in rural Ireland. The signing of the contract for the delivery of the National Broadband Plan in rural areas means that work can now commence on making high-speed internet connectivity available to everyone in Ireland, no matter where they live, work or study.</p>
      <p>“This is a game-changer for rural Ireland.”</p>
      <p>Senator Michelle Mulherin hailed it as a 'landmark day' for Mayo and for rural Ireland generally.</p>
      <p>The contract for the National Broadband Plan, which will see investment of €145 million in the county, will see 12 Mayo community locations initially facilitate local broadband:</p>
      <p>Belderrig Community Centre</p>
      <p>Bofeenaun Community Centre</p>
      <p>Finny Community Centre</p>
      <p>Islandeady Community Centre</p>
      <p>Keel Community Centre</p>
      <p>Keenagh Community Centre</p>
      <p>Killala Business Park</p>
      <p>Killasser Community Centre</p>
      <p>Kilmovee Community Centre</p>
      <p>Clare Island Library</p>
      <p>National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, Ballycroy National Park</p>
      <p>Taugheen Community Centre</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Minister Ring confirmed that the work will start immediately, with roll-out of broadband within eight weeks of today’s contract signing. Over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within four years.</p>
      <p>As an initial step, the government has published a list of approximately 300 community centres, schools, library hubs and local GAA halls in every county that will be connected to high speed broadband during 2020 to enable communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband.</p>
