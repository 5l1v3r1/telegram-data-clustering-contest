      <p>It is the latest BBC drama to get everyone tuning in and everyone talking and Gold Digger continues on BBC1 on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Following hot on the heels of The Capture, which had millions gripped in early autumn, Gold Digger debuted on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC1</a> on Tuesday, November 12 and continues tonight, Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>Gold Digger is centered around Julia, a wealthy woman who falls in love with mysterious younger man Benjamin. Her children worry he’s a gold digger.</p>
      <p>At the heart of the story is a fractured family trying to recover from a violent past.</p>
      <p>Episode 1 saw Julia and Benjamin meet by chance and start dating. But when Julia introduced him to her grown-up children, they questioned if Benjamin's intentions are financially motivated.</p>
      <p>In episode 2 we'll see Julia realise she’s in love with Benjamin. Patrick and Della, who are suspicious of Benjamin, follow him and catch him in a compromising situation. Is he really who he seems?</p>
