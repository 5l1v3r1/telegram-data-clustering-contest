      <h2>The defender's admits his choice of toast topping is 'creepy'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:35:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>Every fan loves to get inside the head of a footballer.</p>
      <p>Getting the inside knowledge of what goes on in the changing room and on the training pitch is every fans dream - but what about the important things?</p>
      <p>Never mind the pre-match mentality of Tomas Kalas, what does he put on his toast? And what supermarket does he shop in?</p>
      <p>The City defender recently took part in a Q&amp;A, which was posted on the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adam-nagy-making-injury-worse-3552321">Bristol City</a> Twitter feed, and fielded some bizarre questions from City fans.</p>
      <p>Here are the highlights form the big Czech whose dry wit ensures he remains one of the most endearing characters in the Robins dressing room.</p>

      <h3>1. Nandos order</h3>
      <p>"Two medium double or single chicken wraps, depends on when I ate last. Halloumi sticks on the side and a fizzy drink."</p>
      <h3>2. Does pineapple belong on pizza?</h3>
      <p>"Yeah, in my world it does. Whatever you like, put it on pizza!"</p>
      <h3>3. Describe your perfect Sunday</h3>
      <p>"Doing absolutely nothing. Wake up around 11am-1pm. Get something to eat and do nothing - unless there is golf planned.</p>
      <p>"That will get me out of bed."</p>
      <h3>4. Who do you room with on away trips?</h3>
      <p>"This year it's Nathan Baker. My brother from another mother."</p>
      <h3>5. What supermarket do you shop in?</h3>
      <p>"You've seen me in Sainsbury's by the stadium haven't you?"</p>
      <h3>6. Is a hot dog a sandwich?</h3>
      <p>"No, a hot dog isn't a sandwich? Is it? No for me it isn't, it's a sausage in a bread roll."</p>

      <h3>7. Scariest thing you've ever done?</h3>
      <p>"When I was younger I used to go hiking with my father into Slovakian mountains and one day we got near to the top and it started to snow and got windy.</p>
      <p>"We were supposed to go over a really narrow lane with a 300-metre fall on the left and right with nothing to hold on to.</p>
      <p>"I'd say that was pretty scary."</p>
      <h3>8. What do you have on toast?</h3>
      <p>"Definitely not Marmite! I would have cream cheese, but loads of it.</p>
      <p>"A bit creepy, but I'd also put tomato ketchup on it and a ton of ham. So basically that's me being a werido."</p>
      <h3>9. Thatchers Gold or Haze?</h3>
      <p>"Any Thatchers. Probably Haze, if it's the one from cloudy apples."</p>
      <h3>10. How many teams in Bristol?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/how-well-bristol-city-leeds-3551360">"Just one. The red one</a>. Nobody is a Bristol Rovers fan."</p>
