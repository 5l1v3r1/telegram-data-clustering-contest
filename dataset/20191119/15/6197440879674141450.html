      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:53:13+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/damien9to5/" target="_blank">Damien Wilde</a></address>
      <p>The OxygenOS 10.0.2 update is now rolling out for the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro with an extensive list of fixes and software improvements for both devices.</p>
      <p>An incremental update, the OxygenOS 10.0.2 OTA was <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-10-0-2-for-the-oneplus-7-pro-and-oneplus-7.1142262/">announced</a> over on the official OnePlus forums and will head out to a limited number of devices over the coming days before a wider rollout globally.</p>
      <p>The changelog is quite extensive and includes optimizations for power consumption, the expanded screenshot, in-car Bluetooth connectivity, network connectivity and performance with third-party chargers. Of course, that isn’t all, there are fixes for blank screen problems, fingerprint icon animations, and there is also room for the October 2019 security patch.</p>
      <p>We saw the Super Stable video feature come in the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/12/oxygenos-10-0-1/">previous OxygenOS update</a> and OnePlus has optimized the performance of this GoPro-like video mode.</p>

      <p>As we mention, the OxygenOS 10.0.2 update is heading out in phases, meaning that using a VPN to try and download might not work as OnePlus confirmed this OTA is not region-based. If you have been lucky enough to get the OTA, are you seeing any improvements overall? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
