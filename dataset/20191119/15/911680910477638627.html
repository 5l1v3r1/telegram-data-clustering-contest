      <h1>Millions of Arizonans affected by Equifax breach must decide now</h1>

      <p>As many as 3 million Arizonans whose personal data may have been exposed in a 2017 data breach have to decide by Nov. 19 whether to be part of a settlement with <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/profile/company/org_ch_add7be5e5d397c1f7668ea4424dc4d70">Equifax</a> for that breach.</p>
      <p>They can opt out of the settlement now and reserve the right to sue the credit monitoring firm later, or take a settlement that includes up to 10 years of credit monitoring or a cash payment that one advocate said is “less than a parking ticket.”</p>
      <p>Even though it’s not much, consumer advocates say it’s probably better to take the sure thing.</p>
      <p>“It’s up to the consumers, but if they back out, what do they get?” asked <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/search/results?q=Ed%20Mierzwinski">Ed Mierzwinski</a> of the Arizona Public Interest Research Group.</p>
