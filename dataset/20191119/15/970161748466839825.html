      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> knows how to feed our <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/true-crime-tv-series-docuseries-documentary/">true crime</a> obsession but upcoming series The Confession Killer might be the most baffling and sinister story yet.</p>
      <p>The streaming service has dropped the trailer for the new show, which documents the case of murderer Henry Lee Lucas.</p>
      <p>Lucas was convicted of the murder of his mother in 1960, and then two others in 1983. But at this time, he started declaring he had killed hundreds of other people.</p>
      <p>Texas Rangers worked closely with Lucas, who ‘solved’ dozens of seemingly unconnected cases as he claimed he would kill ‘at random’ over the course of eight years.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, people are soon quick to question both his confessions, which were often highly detailed, and whether or not they’re the truth.</p>
      <p>If he is to be believed, his kill count goes beyond that of some of the world’s most known serial killers…but to this day, he’s only truly been convicted of 11 more people.</p>
      <p>The new series examines just what went on in the investigation, and how he darkly embraced an almost celebrity persona as his case became more famous.</p>

      <p>Befriending the police force who were trying to convict him, he would be given fast food, strawberry milkshakes and lived a much more comfortable life than the one he had as a drifter.</p>
      <p>Speaking to relatives of the victims he claimed to have killed, it becomes clear that some, while they want to believe the case is solved, simply don’t believe that he did it.</p>
      <p>Then the new questions of who the real killer or killers are begins to be raised, as well as Lucas’s mental state.</p>
      <p>Is he the world’s biggest serial killer? Or is it the biggest hoax in US history?</p>
      <p>We’re already curious to see what the documentary reveals of the cases, and how they plan to conclude the hundreds of cases Lucas confessed to but may not have done.</p>
