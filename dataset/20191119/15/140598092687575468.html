      <h1>Matteo Salvini's bid for return to power in key Italian vote contested by new 'Sardines' protest group </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:29:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/nick-squires/" target="_blank">Nick Squires</a></address>
      <p>As Matteo Salvini plots a return to power after a botched bid to become prime minister in the summer, he faces a vocal new adversary – a brand new grass-roots political movement nicknamed the Sardines.</p>
      <p>They have staged large demonstrations in recent days in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, which Mr Salvini hopes to wrest from the centre-Left at elections in January.</p>
      <p>The region has been a bastion of the centre-Left for decades and for The League to win it would be a huge coup, boosting his chances of success at the national level.  </p>
      <p>The nascent group, launched on social media by four activists, claims it has attracted so many followers that when they gather in piazzas they are crammed in like sardines.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, around 6,000 supporters braved pouring rain to stage a demonstration in a large piazza in the historic city of Modena, a counter-point to a visit to the city by Mr Salvini.</p>
      <p>“We’re tired of the politics of hate,” Samar Zaoui, a university student of Tunisian origin who came to Italy when she was one, told an Italian newspaper. “I’m fed up with the populist rhetoric which is always trying to make a target out of refugees, migrants.”</p>
      <p>That followed a similarly boisterous protest in a piazza in Bologna last week, which was also organised as a riposte to a visit by the leader of The League.</p>

      <p>On both occasions, protesters waved cardboard cut-outs of sardines, yelled anti-Salvini slogans and sang “Bella Ciao”, a folk song that was adopted as anthem of the anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi resistance by partisans during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>The “sardines” are opposed to the hard-Right brand of populist nationalism and anti-immigrant rhetoric espoused by The League, which despite being in opposition remains Italy’s most popular party, with more than 30 per cent of voter support.</p>
      <p>It was in power with the Five Star Movement until August when Mr Salvini pulled the plug in what turned out to be a botched attempt to force a general election in which he had hoped to be elected the leader of a hard-Right government.</p>

      <p>“The whole of Europe should be watching us because this is the end of populism,” said Mattia Santori, one of the four activists who spawned the Sardines in Bologna.</p>
      <p>Although centre-Left in inspiration, the movement appears to be disenchanted with the established Democratic Party and protesters were told not to come bearing party political flags, banners or badges.</p>
      <p>Mr Salvini has been touring the region in support of the League’s candidate for governor, Lucia Borgonzoni, who was a junior culture minister in the last government.</p>
      <p>While in power, she was caught up in a cultural heritage row after threatening to cancel the loan of several works by Leonardo da Vinci to the Louvre in Paris, insisting they should stay in Italy.</p>
      <p>She said the loan was not in Italy’s interest, pointing out that “Leonardo is Italian; he only died in France.”</p>
      <p>She downplayed the challenge posed by the Sardines. “The fact that they lean to the Left is indisputable, so they are not going to be taking votes away from us.”</p>
      <p>The League is also waiting to see whether the upstart movement will endure, given that the regional election in Emilia-Romagna is on January 26, two months away.</p>
      <p>Mr Salvini hopes to build on his triumph last month in Umbria. Like Emilia-Romagna, it was traditionally a Left-leaning region but fell to a Right-wing coalition led by The League.</p>
      <p>The League-led alliance ended 50 years of Left-wing governance in Umbria, sounding alarm bells for the national coalition, an uneasy and fractious partnership between Five Star and the Democratic Party.</p>
