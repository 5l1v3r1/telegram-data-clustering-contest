      <h1>VIA subsidiary Centaur launches an x86 octa-core processor with AI co-processor (for servers)</h1>

      <p>The x86 processor market is largely dominated by Intel and AMD. But at a time when x86 dominance is being challenged by processors based on ARM, RISC-V, or MIPS designs, there are also a few other companies working on x86 processors.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, <a href="https://liliputing.com/tag/zhaoxin">Zhaoxin has been developing x86 processors</a> for use in Chinese PCs. And now Austin-based <a href="https://centtech.com/ai-technology/">Centaur Technology</a> has introduced <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191118005199/en/Centaur-Demonstrates-Industry%E2%80%99s-High-Performance-x86-SoC-Server-Class">a new octa-core x86 system-on-a-chip aimed at servers</a>.</p>

      <p>The new chip is a 16nm processor that runs at 2.5 GHz and which features an artificial intelligence co-processor that Centaur says offers up to 20 TOPS (tera-operations per second) of performance.</p>
      <p>Other features include 16MB of L3 cache, support for 4 channels of PC3200 memory, and 44 PCIe lanes.</p>
      <p>While this is a chip designed for servers rather than desktop or laptop computers, it’s always nice to see a bit of competition. Oh, and for what it’s worth, Centaur is a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.viatech.com/en/">VIA Technologies</a>, which has been producing chips for three decades — although it’s been about 8 years since the company launched its <a href="https://liliputing.com/2011/05/via-introduces-quadcore-low-power-x86-processor.html">last</a> <a href="https://liliputing.com/2011/05/via-launches-nano-x2-e-series-low-power-chips.html">processors</a> <a href="https://liliputing.com/2011/03/via-introduces-eden-x2-low-power-dual-core-chips.html">based</a> on x86 architecture.</p>
      <p>You can read more about the new Centaur chip in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191118005199/en/Centaur-Demonstrates-Industry%E2%80%99s-High-Performance-x86-SoC-Server-Class">press release</a> and <a href="https://centtech.com/wp-content/uploads/PRSlides_1118_Release.pdf">presentation slide deck</a>.</p>
