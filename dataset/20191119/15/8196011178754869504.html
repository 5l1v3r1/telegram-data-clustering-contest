      <p>More than one in five adolescents suffer from severe anxiety, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>The number of adolescents aged between 12 and 19, reporting severe anxiety doubled from 11% to 22%.</p>
      <p>Levels of severe anxiety in young adults (18-25 years) increased from 15% to 26% - an 11% increase.</p>
      <p>The significant increase in anxiety since 2012 is reported in My World Survey 2, a major study on youth mental health.</p>
      <p>The proportion of adolescents who fell into the severe and very severe categories for depression increased from 8% to 15%.</p>
      <p>Young adults with severe and very severe depression had also increased – from 14% to 21%.</p>
      <p>Young adults (33%) were also more likely to report that they deliberately hurt themselves without wanting to take their own life than those in the earlier survey (22%).</p>
      <p>About two-thirds had thought about taking their life but “would not do it”. Sadly, one in ten had made a suicide attempt.</p>
      <p>It emerged that males had significantly higher self-esteem, optimism and life satisfaction than females.</p>
      <p>Also when adolescents were faced with problems, 60% talked about them with someone.</p>
      <p>Females (63%) were more likely than males (56%) to talk to someone about their problems.</p>
      <p>Over 19,000 young people were consulted for the follow-up and extension of the 2012 My World Study 1.</p>
      <p>There was a decrease from 45% to 39% in the proportion of adolescents being bullied and those who had ever consumed alcohol had fallen from 51% to 42%.</p>

      <p>One in ten young adults did not drink alcohol, 42% drank alcohol every week and 2% daily or almost daily.</p>
      <p>Of those who drank, 7% were at risk of harm and 6% were classified as having possible alcohol dependence.</p>
      <p>More than half (53%) of young adults had smoked cannabis and 40% had used drugs other than those needed for medical reasons.</p>
      <p>The comprehensive study of young people's mental health was developed by Jigsaw, the National Centre for Youth Mental Health, and the University College Dublin's School of Psychology.</p>
      <p>Chief executive of Jigsaw, Dr Joseph Duffy, said the study indicated that more needs to be done to address the main issues affecting young people.</p>
      <p>“The increased levels of anxiety and depression, the decreased levels of self-esteem, optimism and life-satisfaction and growing trends of self-harm are of particular concern,” said Dr Duffy.</p>
      <p>A member of Jigsaw's youth advisory panel, Rachel White, said the report must be the start of a new and honest conversation about what it is to be young in Ireland.</p>
      <p>While there were some positives the report was, in the main, a wake-up call, said Ms White</p>
      <blockquote>The question we should really be asking ourselves is are we ready as a nation to step up and take up collective responsibility for our young people's mental health and the answer should be, and must be, a loud and emphatic yes.</blockquote>
      <p>She was glad, however, that social media was not the “demon” that some people would have them believe.</p>
      <p>“Young people are predominantly using social media to enhance and continue friendships and relationships that they made offline,” she pointed out.</p>
