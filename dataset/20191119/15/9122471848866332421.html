      <h1>ESPN Releases Its Week 13 Heisman Trophy Ballot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:44:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>With only two weeks left in the regular season, there are only a handful of legitimate candidates left in the running for the Heisman Trophy. Since Tua Tagovailoa’s year is now over, ESPN has a new player on its ballot.</p>
      <p>As of right now, the odds-on favorite to win the Heisman is Joe Burrow. He’s been great for LSU this season in large part because of its new-look offense.</p>
      <p>Another quarterback that is firmly in the mix to win the Heisman Trophy is Jalen Hurts. However, the Oklahoma signal-caller needs to play well to prevent Justin Fields from leapfrogging him in the rankings.</p>
      <p>Out of all the top candidates that<a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/HeismanWatch191119/heisman-watch-justin-fields-make-late-push"> ESPN listed</a>, the only non-quarterback is Chuba Hubbard. The Oklahoma State running back already has 1,726 rushing yards and 20 touchdowns this season.</p>
      <p>Here are ESPN’s top five candidates:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Joe Burrow, LSU QB</li>
        <li>Jalen Hurts, Oklahoma QB</li>
        <li>Justin Fields, Ohio State QB</li>
        <li>Chuba Hubbard, Oklahoma State RB</li>
        <li>Chase Young, Ohio State DE</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Chase Young’s stock fell due to his two-game suspension from the NCAA. He’ll have two opportunities to shine on the national stage though, as Ohio State faces Penn State and Michigan in back-to-back games.</p>
      <p>Who do you think will win the Heisman Trophy this year?</p>
