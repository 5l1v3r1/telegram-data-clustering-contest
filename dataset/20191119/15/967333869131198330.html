      <h1>Is India Becoming A Haven for Foreign Criminals?</h1>

      <p>According to the latest statistics from India’s National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), 49 percent of the 2,242 <a href="http://sputniknews.com/military/20190812/1076533394.html">crimes</a> committed by foreigners in 2017 happened in the state of West Bengal.</p>
      <blockquote>“West Bengal is near the border which makes it easy for the criminals to get in easily,” a senior police official told Sputnik while requesting anonymity.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier in 2016, a total of 1,226 criminal cases were attributed to foreign residents in India, however, since then, the cases have surged alarmingly, by up to 82 percent.</p>
      <p>India’s national capital, New Delhi statistically hosts the most foreign guests in the country.</p>
      <p>Reports reveal that the city witnessed around 173 cases of non-Indians committing felonies ranging from <a href="http://sputniknews.com/science/20190829/1076666113.html">cyber-crime</a> to theft and fraud.</p>
      <p>As many as 11 murders and 16 <a href="http://sputniknews.com/analysis/20181217/1070764242.html">rape cases</a> allegedly involving foreigners were reported in 2017.</p>
      <p>Around 1,285 cases of non-natives of India illegally entering or extending their stay in India have also been noted, the data suggests.</p>
      <blockquote>“They enter the country illegally or with forged documents and tend to stay here even after their visas expire,” the police official said.</blockquote>
      <p>On the other hand, the study also highlights how some Indians commit crimes against foreigners in the country, which welcomes nearly 10 million travellers and immigrants every year.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a total of 9.6 million international citizens visited India, registering a total of 492 cases against Indian nationals.</p>
      <p>While New Delhi witnessed the maximum number of complaints from outsiders, the central and southern states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu also emerged as unsafe spots for foreigners in India.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, despite being a terror hotspot, the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, sometimes described as “heaven on earth” did not witness any crimes against foreigners at all.</p>
