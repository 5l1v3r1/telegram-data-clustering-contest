      <h1>Lamborghini Now Uses Salesforce Blockchain to Certify Heritage Cars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:31:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>Italian luxury sports car brand Lamborghini is using <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/salesforce-introduces-hyperledger-based-blockchain-platform">Salesforce Blockchain</a> to authenticate heritage Lamborghini cars. Salesforce, a major global customer relationship management firm, <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Automobili-Lamborghini-Accelerates-Trust-and-Authenticity-with-Salesforce/default.aspx">announced</a> on Nov. 19 that Lamborghini can now trace, certify and authenticate heritage cars faster and more securely using its blockchain platform.</p>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/salesforce-introduces-hyperledger-based-blockchain-platform">Launched</a> in May 2019, Salesforce’s Hyperledger-based blockchain platform will now be implemented to create a trusted network between multiple participants for certification checks during a Lamborghini’s resale.</p>
      <h3>Each Lamborghini vehicle will now come with an immutable record of service</h3>
      <p>Typically, when a Lamborgini is resold, the vehicle goes through 800 or 1,000 certification inspections that take place at the Lamborghini headquarters in Italian Sant'Agata Bolognese, the press release notes.</p>
      <p>The process requires Lamborghini to work with a huge network of resources such as photographers, auction houses, dealerships, repair shops and media sources — to register the full history and verify all of the parts and service history of each vehicle.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the firms claim that each Lamborghini vehicle will now come with an immutable record of service, including major details such as prior ownership and restoration. The new system is also designed to protect Lamborghini cars against potential counterfeiting as all authentication checks are managed by Lamborghini and its partner network, the press release notes.</p>
      <p>Lamborghini’s use of Salesforce Blockchain follows a recent pilot project involving its first vehicle certified using Salesforce’s blockchain. In August 2019, a one-of-a-kind Lamborghini Aventador S was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/salesforce-blockchain-certifies-first-ever-artwork-painted-lamborghini">certified</a> on Salesforce Blockchain for a show at the 2019 Monterey Car Week in California to protect the car as a work of art.</p>
