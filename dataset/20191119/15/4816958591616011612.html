      <p>NEW YORK — A woman who accuses Jeffrey Epstein of sexually abusing her as a child on Monday said Britain’s Prince Andrew should tell U.S. authorities what he knows about the financier.</p>
      <p>“Prince Andrew, and any others who were close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have,” the woman, calling herself Jane Doe 15, said at a news conference with her lawyer Gloria Allred.</p>
      <p>The statement comes as the Duke faces increasing backlash over his “disastrous” BBC Newsnight interview about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, which has not only heightened public scrutiny but has also led to a succession of charities and organizations threatening to sever ties with him.</p>
      <p>In the interview on Saturday, Prince Andrew denied having sex with Virginia Giuffre, another of Epstein’s alleged victims, who said in a previously filed lawsuit that she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17.</p>
      <p>KPMG, one of the world’s biggest accountancy firms, confirmed it had pulled the plug on its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace, the Duke’s flagship charity initiative, with sources citing “adverse media publicity”.</p>
      <p>AstraZeneca, another partner, said: “Our three-year partnership with Pitch@Palace is due to expire at the end of this year and is currently being reviewed.”</p>
      <p>At Huddersfield University, where the Duke is chancellor, the students’ union panel has voted on a motion to lobby him to resign.</p>

      <p>Now, the Outward Bound Trust, a prominent youth organization, has reportedly convened an emergency board meeting to consider his patronage.</p>
      <p>At a press conference last night in California, Jane Doe 15 said she had been invited to a party on the paedophile’s private island at which she learnt the Duke would be present.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was contacted by one of Jeffrey Epstein’s assistants and invited to Epstein’s island where I was told Prince Andrew, among others, would be a guest. I declined the invitation out of fear. I had only experienced a glimpse of Epstein’s world, but it left me with residual trauma.”</p>
      <p>Epstein’s brother and his lawyers have questioned a medical examiner’s conclusion that his death was a suicide. Doe on Monday wore a bracelet with the words, “Epstein didn’t kill himself.”</p>
      <p>Doe, who grew up in a poor family in the Midwest, met Epstein’s secretary during a 2004 school trip to New York City. The secretary later invited her to view a magic show in Las Vegas and then fly to Epstein’s New Mexico ranch in his private jet, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>The secretary said Epstein was interested in helping girls who were in difficult circumstances, and when Doe arrived, Epstein summoned her to give him a massage alone, and then sexually assaulted her, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty. Two days earlier he signed a will and put his estimated $577 million estate into a trust.</p>
      <p>The financier once counted among his friends U.S. President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>In a further blow to his reputation, the Duke was also accused last night of using the racist “n-word” during a business meeting with a Downing Street adviser seven years ago.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the estate’s executors could not be reached for comment.</p>

      <p>The woman’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, said: “I’ve called on Prince Andrew to voluntarily speak with law enforcement in the US and he should do that as soon as possible. Every day, where someone who has relevant information does not come forward, might seem like a year or two to those who are victims. They deserve the truth.”</p>

      <p>The Daily Telegraph has also learnt that more legal documents are due to be released in the US relating to the predatory sexual activities of Epstein which will name the Duke.</p>
      <p>A judge will decide whether to unseal the new tranche of documents within weeks.</p>
      <p>It emerged yesterday that even the Duchess of York, her ex-husband’s staunchest supporter, has accepted that the Newsnight interview was “a car crash”, according to friends.</p>
      <p>The Duke is said to have told the Queen that his Newsnight appearance was a success, although he has apparently confided in friends that he “regrets” not expressing sympathy for Epstein’s victims.</p>
      <p>The executors Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn last week said they would seek to create a compensation fund for victims. The proposal must be approved by a court in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is overseeing the estate.</p>
