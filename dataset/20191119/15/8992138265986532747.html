      <h3>A lengthy career with banking FX business</h3>
      <p>Mr. Hamberger joined Credit Agricole three years ago coming from Commerzbank, following nearly a decade with the group. He worked out of Commerzbank’s Frankfurt office since 2006, where he held a number of executive-level roles, including his last position as the head of e-Fic. Prior to this he was also the global head of FX bank sales and FX e-commerce sales.</p>
      <p>Additional stops also include BNP Paribas, where he manned the FX sales desk, part of a lengthy career extending back to 1995.</p>
      <p>Hamberger’s promotion is the first executive move since last month when FX veteran <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/executives/moves/credit-agricole-adds-jesse-bass-as-senior-em-fx-rates-trader/">Jesse Bass</a> joined the Paris-based lender as a senior trader for emerging markets FX and rates. Bass has landed at Credit Agricole after ending an 11-year-tenure at <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/standard-chartered/">Standard Chartered Bank</a>, where he most recently served as was Executive Director of emerging markets forex and rates trading.</p>
      <p>Despite the recent additions, Credit Agricole has a notable void in its FX operations following the abrupt departure of <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/executives/moves/global-head-of-fx-options-andrew-soper-leaves-credit-agricole/">Andrew Soper</a>, the global head of foreign exchange (forex) options trading, after nearly two years at the bank.</p>
