      <p> A former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland</a> councillor has appeared in court charged with eight historical child sex offences.</p>
      <p>Thomas Wright is accused of abusing four children, between the ages of 12 and 15, between 1968 and 1982.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old appeared in the dock on crutches at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">South Tyneside Magistrates' Court</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He was facing <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/former-sunderland-councillor-charged-historic-17132046">three counts of buggery</a>, three of indecent assault on a boy under 16 and two of indecent assault on a girl under 16.</p>
      <p>The court was told that the buggery charges could only be heard at the crown court and, because they were linked, the other offences should also be sent there.</p>
      <p>Wright, of no fixed abode but formerly of First Street, Leadgate, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/consett">Consett,</a> spoke only to tell magistrates that he no longer had a fixed address and to confirm his name, date of birth and nationality.</p>

      <p>He also confirmed he understood the proceedings against him.</p>
      <p>No pleas to the offences, which all allegedly took place in Sunderland, were taken during the five-minute hearing.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor, Lorna Rimell, said: "The charges are all linked, so should be sent together to the crown court."</p>
      <p>Magistrates released Wright on unconditional bail to next appear at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> on December 17.</p>
      <p>Wright was was elected to represent the St Anne's ward on the local authority in 2002.</p>
      <p>During his time as a councillor, he played a leading role on the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Authority.</p>
      <p>He stepped down from the council in May 2018.</p>
      <p>The ex-Labour councillor has been under investigation and suspended from the Labour party since 2018.</p>
