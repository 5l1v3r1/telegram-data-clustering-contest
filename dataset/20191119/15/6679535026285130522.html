      <p>Madurai</p>
      <p>The second waste shredding machine, a contraption that helps in recycling used plastic bottles, was inaugurated at Madurai railway junction on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The machine, which was set up by W2W Enterprise, an organisation looking to create a sustainable future for the city, will be able to hold 3,000 bottles, according to its founder A. Dhanalakshmi.</p>
      <p>The bottles would be cleared and given to plastic manufacturers.</p>
      <p>“In this day and age, it is impossible to get rid of PET bottles which accumulate in large quantities. They only end up filling up landfills. This machine would discard bottles with liquids and will reject materials such as metals,” she said.</p>
      <p>She added that the pet bottles can be made into fibre and even be used for fuel generation.</p>
      <p>Apart from such a facility in Madurai, W2W has tied up with Tirunelveli, Dindigul and Coimbatore Corporations and has set up 12 such units across Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>Senior officials from J. K. Fenner, who sponsored the machine, including Vice President- Supply Chain Management, M. Saravana Marthandam, Assistant Vice President- Operations, P. G. S. Dinesh Davidson, and others participated in the inauguration.</p>
      <p>Station Manager Sachin Kumar launched the machine. All passengers on the platform were encouraged to use the facility as it is located close to the waiting room on Platform No. 1.</p>
