        <b>KBC is opening up its mobile app to the wider public beyond its customer base, providing access to a range of third party non-banking services.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taking the banking-as-a-service model to its natural conclusion, the KBC app will provide non-customers with an array of services beyond the usual account management and transactional options.<br/><br/>Users who download the app will be able to immediately buy De Lijn and SNCB public transport tickets and pay for parking at 4411 and Q-Park sites. By the end of the year other services will become available, including airport lounge and fast-lane passes, group energy purchasing deals, merchant discounts, and mobile safe deposit services. <br/><br/>Karin Van Hoecke, general manager for digital transformation at KBC Belgium says: "The distinction between customers and non-customers is becoming increasingly blurred. Consumers are looking for the fastest and easiest way to meet a particular need and they only want to see information and services that are relevant and tailored to the way they organise their lives. <br/><br/>"They expect to have access to a much wider and more attractive package of services, which they want to be able to activate quickly and easily from a single central app, without fuss or having to download 10 different apps. <br/><br/>"KBC will focus on this heavily in the years ahead. Weâ€™re going to develop KBC Mobile into an open platform that is readily accessible to every consumer and adds genuine financial value."</p>
