      <p>It’s not officially Shark Week, but for trackers along the East Coast, several great white sharks are putting on a show.</p>
      <p>The Charlotte Observer reports nine sharks tagged by the ocean data-gathering organization OCEARCH have appeared near the coast in a five-day span, including two that are about 12 feet long.</p>
      <p>Tracking shows two sharks near Charleston, South Carolina. Five more are near the Outer Banks.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear why so many sharks are swimming near shore in the same region, but OCEARCH’s Chris Fischer told The Outer Banks Voice that the area is a key spot in the shark’s migration.</p>
