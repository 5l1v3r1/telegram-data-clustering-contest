      <p>As you may have noticed, <b>Dermot Mulroney</b> has lent his voice to a handful of episodes of the USA Network’s TV series <b>“The Purge”</b> dating back to the first season, and we’ll finally be meeting his character Bobby Sheridan face-to-face on tonight’s brand new episode.</p>
      <p>Mulroney explains, “<i>I play Bobby Sheridan this season, but the trick is that I also played him in Season 1, just as a voice over. It was really fun to be revealed as the voice that guided last season’s main character, Joe, through his Purge night. This season is more about what takes place in between Purges so you’re seeing the everyday life of a society that exists under those rules, and I play the voice of the Purge, an integral part in this universe</i>.”</p>
      <p>On tonight’s <b>“Happy Holidays”</b>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Marcus sinks into darkness; Esme is on the run; Ben returns home; Ryan gets an unexpected visitor.”</blockquote>
      <p>Don’t miss the all-new episode of “The Purge” tonight, November 19 at 9/8c on USA.</p>
