      <p>Josh O’Connor, who plays the future king in season three of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> series <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-crown">The Crown</a> , has spoken out about how Prince Charles lives in the shadow of his mother.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-charles-prince-of-wales">Prince Of Wales</a> actor, 29, delved beneath the surface of Prince Charles to truly capture his character in the hit royal series, but discovered some sad realities.</p>
      <p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/josh-o-connor-the-crown-season-3-interview">GQ Hype</a> , the rising star insisted that Prince Charles' whole life has been lived in "purgatory" and said that he is "waiting for his mother to die."</p>

      <p>He shockingly told the publication: "What I’m gradually finding is a guy waiting for his mother to die for his life to have meaning. His whole life has been in purgatory.</p>
      <p>"Waiting for your parent to die is pretty messed up."</p>
      <p>Josh said the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-queen">Queen</a> is responsible for whether or not Charles' life can have meaning.</p>
      <p>He continued: "That the one person who should be unconditional is the person that holds the power for you to have any meaning in your life.</p>
      <p>"It’s quite nice to play that. They’re huge stakes"</p>

      <p>This certainly runs true, as Queen Elizabeth is the longest ever serving monarch, aged 93, with Prince Charles remaining the next in line for the throne, aged 71.</p>
      <p>The young prince makes his series debut in episode six, where he endures a semester 'abroad' to learn Welsh at the order of his family and government.</p>
      <p>Netflix's hit series The Crown has already begun taking over the lives of its fans as season three arrived at the weekend with a bang.</p>

      <p>To get his portrayal of Prince Charles right, Josh did a lot of research on his character before acting him out.</p>
      <p>He learned to ride a horse and started eating a lot of boiled eggs to resemble Prince Charles' eating habits.</p>
      <p>The star also told GQ Hype that he had to mimic the prince's habits correctly, even down to finicky details such as how he holds a horse's reins in an unusual way.</p>
