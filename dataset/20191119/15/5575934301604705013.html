      <p>Former <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/uber-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">Uber</a> CEO Travis Kalanick sold another $US171 million worth of stock from Thursday to Monday, further liquidating his position in the company he founded.</p>
      <p>Kalanick offloaded roughly 6.4 million shares over three sales, at an average price of $US26.55 per share, according to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000156218019005559/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">a Monday SEC filing</a>. His combined sales to date now ring in at more than $US882 million.</p>
      <p>The former CEO sold $US547 million worth of stock in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/travis-kalanick-sells-uber-shares-as-he-prepares-next-act-2019-11">the first week of November</a>, and an additional $US164 million worth of stock <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/former-uber-ceo-kalanick-sells-another-164-million-of-stock-2019-11-1028689950">between November 11 and November 13</a>.</p>
      <p>Kalanick still holds more than 65 million Uber shares. The position equates to 3.82% of the company’s outstanding stock, and was worth approximately $US1.8 billion as of Tuesday morning, with Uber trading near $US27 a share.</p>
      <p>Kalanick’s sales come after Uber’s lockup period ended on November 6. Lockup phases keep early investors from selling shares immediately after an initial public offering. The 180-day window’s expiration prompted a massive sell-off by initial investors in the rideshare company and pushed Uber’s stock <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-stock-price-post-ipo-lockup-value-lowest-since-2015-2019-11-1028665630?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">to record lows</a>.</p>
      <p>Since resigning from Uber in June 2017, Kalanick has his attention to other projects. The 43-year-old now helms CloudKitchens, a company that rents commercial space and turns it into leasable kitchens for delivery-based restaurants. The former CEO spent $US300 million to fund the startup.</p>
      <p>CloudKitchens received <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/uber-travis-kalanick-saudi-arabia-funding-cloud-kitchens-delivery-2019-11">a major backing from Saudi Arabia in January</a>, with the kingdom’s sovereign-wealth fund sinking $US400 million into the startup. The investment valued CloudKitchens at about $US5 billion.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-back-travis-kalanicks-new-startup-11573122604?shareToken=stcc22b2bd5ab94bceafc0fb97f2b4a123">Wall Street Journal</a> first reported on the Saudi investment on November 7.</p>
      <p>Uber has 26 “buy” ratings, 11 “hold” ratings, and one “sell” rating from analysts, with a consensus price target of $US45.15, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
      <p>The company’s stock has declined roughly 40% since going public in May.</p>
