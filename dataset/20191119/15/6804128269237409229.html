      <h2>Eden Hazard has been speaking about Frank Lampard and Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:45:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Eden Hazard has made a big admission about <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> after a strong start to the season for the Blues.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/eden-hazard">Hazard</a> has not had a major impact in Spain, having only scored just once for Real Madrid since his move from Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Belgium's clash in the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyrus this evening, Hazard was interviewed by Sky Sports about his current form but also what he has made of Chelsea so far this season.</p>
      <p>Despite a transfer ban and losing Hazard in the summer and Frank Lampard currently working through his first season as manager, Chelsea are third in the Premier League after six consecutive league wins.</p>
      <p>This had led to praise aplenty for Chelsea's young guns and Lampard's management, with Hazard the latest to provide a glowing verdict.</p>
      <p>"When I watch them, [there is] no Hazard but it is a party," Hazard told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"They can score a lot of goals, the fans are happy, they are third in the league, it is going to be a great season. They just need to stay there and win games.</p>
      <p>"We all know Willian, Jorginho they are very good. Also with the young players coming through, it is great to see the club high and I hope they can stay there."</p>

      <p>When asked if he would like to have played under Lampard, Hazard replied: "Yeah, of course."</p>
      <p>On Chelsea's chances of defeating two-time reigning champions Man City at the weekend, Hazard added: "Of course, I think so. It's hard to play there. We lost there 6-0 last time. Chelsea are really good and young. Why not go there and win?"</p>
