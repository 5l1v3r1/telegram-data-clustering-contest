      <h1>Italy gets through to Euro 2020 with a perfect record</h1>
      <h2>The team ended its last qualifier with 9-1 against Armenia while Spain, Denmark and Switzerland also confirmed their participation in the European Championship finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:56:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Denmark and Switzerland secured spots at Euro 2020 at the expense of the Republic of Ireland on Monday as Roberto Mancini’s Italy completed a perfect qualifying campaign by scoring nine.</p>
      <p>Ireland needed to beat Denmark in Dublin to clinch qualification for next year’s 24-team European Championship finals, but Matt Doherty’s late header was only enough to earn Mick McCarthy’s men a 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium. Switzerland secured top spot with a 6-1 away win against minnow Gibraltar as Cedric Itten scored twice. Skipper and Arsenal outcast Granit Xhaka netted its final goal.</p>
      <p>Italy had already wrapped up qualification from Group J but saved its best for last, making it 10 wins from 10 by hammering Armenia 9-1 in Palermo with seven different scorers. Ciro Immobile and Nicolo Zaniolo both scored braces, while Nicolo Barella and Alessio Romagnoli found the net before Chelsea midfielder Jorginho converted a penalty.</p>
      <p>Riccardo Orsolini came off the bench to score on his Italy debut and Federico Chiesa finished off the scoring after Edgar Babayan had pulled one back for Armenia. Meanwhile, Group F winner Spain rounded out its qualifying campaign with a 5-0 destruction of Romania in Madrid. Gerard Moreno scored twice after midfielder Fabian Ruiz opened the scoring. Adrian Rus put through his own net in first-half stoppage time and Real Sociedad striker Mikel Oyarzabal wrapped up the win amid reports the match was Robert Moreno’s last as coach.</p>
