      <p>Vikings season six is just around the corner, yet they can’t help but keep on dishing out the spoilers.</p>
      <p>While we eagerly anticipate the final installment of the show, bosses of the History Channel hit have gone and basically confirmed yet another death.</p>
      <p>Yes, after seemingly revealing both Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick) and Floki (Gustaf Skarsgård) are on their way out, they’ve now teased Hvitserk (Marco Ilsø) will be joining his father, Ragnar Lodbrok (Travis Fimmel), in Valhalla.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In a short clip from upcoming episodes, the warrior can be seen tied to a stake as he says his final words to his brother Ubbe (Jordan Patrick Smith).</p>
      <p>‘Don’t you see, Ubbe?’ he struggles to muster up: ‘I was an instrument of the Gods, it was my fate, it was me.’</p>

      <p>While his big bro remains speechless, the camera pans out and shows flames engulfing Hvitserk out at sea.</p>
      <p>Looking up towards the sky, the fan favourite doesn’t look scared or in pain, but more at peace that he will be united with the God, Odin.</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to comment, and appeared unimpressed by the clip – which could have just confirmed another death.</p>
      <p>‘I hope you guys didn’t just spoil anything,’ one wrote while another added: ‘You’re really ruining the season.’</p>

      <p>And it appears this was the general consensus, as someone else said: ‘Why the f**k you just spoiled Hvsiterk death?’</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time the character’s death has been teased, as in a recent Q&amp;A, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/10/vikings-season-6-will-hvitserk-die-marco-ilso-shares-worrying-bts-snap-10153862/">Marco Ilsø who stars as Hvitserk teased bad things were on their way.</a></p>
      <p>One of the actor’s 345,000 followers asked the question we’ve all been wanting to know the answer to: ‘Will Hvitserk survive?’</p>
      <p>And while his answer was extremely vague, the picture behind the 24-year-old’s response gave us goosebumps.</p>

      <p>He wrote back, ‘maybe… maybe not,’ over a shot of himself in full viking gear with fake blood smothered across his face while his hair was dripping wet with rain.</p>
