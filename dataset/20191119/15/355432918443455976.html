      <h1>Biden maintains double-digit lead, Sanders in second: poll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:56:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Marty Johnson</a></address>
      <p>A new <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/">Morning Consult poll</a> shows former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> with a 12-point lead nationally over the rest of the 2020 Democratic Primary field as Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) has moved into second place.</p>
      <p>According to the poll, among Democratic primary voters, Biden led Democratic presidential candidates with 32 percent of the votes, followed by Sanders at 20 percent, and Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) placing third with 17 percent. </p>
      <p>No other Democratic candidate polled in double digits.</p>
      <p>Biden also had a <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/465825-biden-maintains-double-digit-national-lead-on-warren-in-morning-consult">double-digit lead</a> in the same poll last month, but Warren was the runner-up in that survey, 2 points ahead of Sanders.</p>
      <p>The poll released Tuesday also specified results in early primary states Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.</p>
      <p>In this subsect of Democratic voters, Biden's (29 percent) lead over Sanders (18 percent) and Warren (17 percent) was slightly less and South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> broke into double digits with 10 percent of the vote.</p>
      <p>In a recent <a href="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/11/16/rel4a_ia.pdf">Des Moines Register/CNN pol</a>l, Buttigieg, who has recently enjoyed a strong surge in Iowa, home of the nation's first presidential caucuses, leads Warren by nine points. Biden and Sanders both trail by 10 points in the Hawkeye State.</p>
      <p>However, a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3649">recent Quinnipiac poll</a> shows Biden with a massive lead in South Carolina (33 percent) over Warren (13 percent), Sanders (11 percent) and Buttigieg (6 percent).</p>
      <p>Morning Consult's latest poll is based on 17,050 Democratic voters who were interviewed between Nov. 11-17, 2019. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point for the national results and plus or minus 4 percentage points for the early primary state voters.</p>
