      <p>After a week-long lull, several parts of the district received sharp showers on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The district received incessant rains, including few spells of thunder showers on Tuesday, inundating roads and low lying residential and shopping areas. The rains lashed the district, a couple of days after the Big Tank here received Vaigai water, which was released to the district from Vaigai dam for irrigation.</p>
      <p>The rains brought cheers to farmers who had taken up paddy cultivation in about 1.25 lakh hectares of rain fed areas and taken up fertilization in full swing. Power supply was disrupted in the northern parts of the town after lightening struck and damaged the ceramic insulators in the power lines. Tangedco personnel replaced the damaged insulators and restored power supply in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>In a brief chat with reporters, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said the district has received widespread rainfall since the onset of north east monsoon in October. The district had received 384.41 mm of rainfall in the month of October, which was against the average rainfall of 182.6 mm.</p>
      <p>This month, the district has so far received 41.49 mm of rainfall, he said.</p>
      <p>As the district administration had already completed desilting of 69 waterbodies under the Chief Minister’s ‘kudimaramathu’ scheme and 224 minor irrigation tanks and 988 ooranies under the Rural Development Department’s kudimaramathu scheme the rainwater was effectively harvested and stored, he said. Farmers also harvested the rainwater in their farm ponds, he added.</p>
