      <p>An Italian youth showed their coach the exit door for guiding his team to a 27-0 win against their opponents.</p>
      <p>Tuscany-based side Invictasauro proved too good for Marina Calcio as they tore the hosts apart to march to an emphatic victory.</p>
      <p>However, in a bizarre turn of events, Invictasauro president Paulo Brogelli left everyone in shock as he swung the axe on Massimiliano Riccini for being "disrespectful" towards their opponent.</p>
