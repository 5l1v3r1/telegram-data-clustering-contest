      <p>The owner of a luxury B&amp;B treated her husband “like a slave” whom she attacked for trivial mistakes such as using the wrong kettle and leaving the fridge door open, a court has heard. </p>
      <p>Clare Weston ran the highly regarded Shepherd House hotel in Faversham, Kent, with her husband Simon, allegedly subjecting him to “systemic physical and verbal abuse”. </p>
      <p>The 41-year-old is accused of intimidating and attacking her partner for more than a year, until he overcame embarrassment about his treatment and reported her to police. </p>
      <p>The hotelier is now on trial at Maidstone Crown Court charged with controlling and coercive behaviour between December 2017 and February this year, which she denies. </p>
      <p>Daniel Smith, prosecuting, told a jury that Ms Weston had punched her husband in the head, pushed a mug of tea in his face and kicking his locked bedroom door until it split.</p>
      <p>He said: "Clare Weston treated her husband virtually as a slave and, on occasion, worse than a slave.</p>
      <p>"He put up with it until it broke him and he left the marriage.</p>
      <p>"Of course, all marriages go through unhappy times and moments, but this wasn't unhappy moments. It was systematic physical and verbal abuse.</p>
      <p>"She wore him down."</p>
      <p>Mr Smith said some of the incidents might appear “pretty trivial” but Mr Weston was “continually punished” for them by his wife. </p>
      <p>Describing the episode where the wrong kettle was used to make a cup of tea, the prosecutor said: "It is as ridiculous as that.</p>
      <p>"She kneed him in the groin, punched him in the face and kept blocking his path as he tried to get out of the way.</p>
      <p>"As he was doing that she pushed the mug as he went to take a sip, knocking it in his face and causing a cut on the bridge of his nose and bruising between the eyebrows.</p>
      <p>"It was a deliberate blow designed to hurt him."</p>
      <p>The couple converted their Georgian townhouse into a hotel in 2015 and it quickly became a highly rated bed and breakfast business.</p>
      <p>A review by the <i>Telegraph</i> in 2017 described Shepherd House, where rooms cost between £145 and £185 a night, as “like staying with hospitable friends”. </p>
      <p>But behind the scenes, the prosecutor claimed, Mr Weston was being treated “worse than a dog” and suffered abuse in nine separate incidents. </p>
      <p>On one occasion, Ms Weston was allegedly furious over the standard of work her husband had put into chores and he locked himself in the bedroom out of fear. </p>
      <p>"She kicked it so hard she broke the lock and shouted 'If you don't get downstairs and clean the kitchen, I'm going to break you',” said Mr Smith.</p>
      <p>"She called him 'a disgusting scumbag' and said 'You are going to spend the rest of your life in the basement'.”</p>
      <p>Mr Weston finally reported his wife to police after two incidents on February 1 this year - another alleged assault and two abusive rants.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: "He went to Kent Police, terribly embarrassed and ashamed that here was a man complaining of being bullied by a woman.</p>
      <p>"But so bad was it, and so bad was the impact on him and the damage she had done psychologically to him, that he had to go to the police."</p>
      <p>The trial continues. </p>
