      <p>"Don't call us 'lazy'" - that's the message from one mum who has penned a searingly honest account of being a stay-at-home mother.</p>
      <p>Natalie Hewitt wrote on social media about her role - saying that mums who don't work "live this life of Riley, sitting on our a***s all day doing nothing".</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two often wakes up dreading "another day of same s**t different day", she admits.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/parenting/stay-home-mum-lazy-honest-17280586">The M.E.N</a> . wrote the mother said: "Is there anything more frustrating than people that think stay at home mums live this life of Riley sitting on our a***s all day doing nothing? I wish I could sit at home all day doing nothing.</p>
      <p>"Nobody sees that look on your face when you wake up in a morning..happy to see your children's faces but the dread on your face knowing today is another day of same s*** different day.</p>

      <p>"Nobody sees that you didn't even get five minutes to eat breakfast so you dunked a couple of custard creams in a cold brew.</p>
      <p>"Nobody sees the huge pile of washing that's hidden in the kitchen, or the amount of times you wash pots and hoover up everyday.</p>
      <p>"Nobody sees how many times you go to sit down and as soon as you do your children demand your attention.</p>
      <p>"Nobody sees your greasy hair that you haven't washed in a week because you don't have time and when you do you just embrace the silence and enjoy a bit of adult TV instead of Peppa Pig.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"Nobody notices that you haven't left the house in weeks because you're too anxious to go out.</p>
      <p>"Nobody sees the amount of times you sit on the toilet for 10 minutes scrolling just for that bit of "me" time.</p>
      <p>"The things I'd do for a lie-in, a long soak in a hot bath and three meals in one day, it would be like Christmas had come early.</p>
      <p>"So before you judge a stay-at-home mum for being 'lazy', remember she probably hasn't eaten today and she's probably not sat down for five minutes but she's run around after her children all day and made sure they are happy and looked after.</p>
      <p>"And if you have a friend thats a "stay-at-home mum" pop round for a brew or even give them a message! A bit of adult company/conversation helps to keep us going."</p>
