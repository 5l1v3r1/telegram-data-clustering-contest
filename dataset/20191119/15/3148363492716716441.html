      <h1>Kamala Harris Renews Push for Mandatory AR-15 Buybacks</h1>
      <h2>Democrat presidential hopeful Kamala Harris used a NBC News Nightly News with Lester Holt appearance to renew her push for a government mandated buyback of AR-15 rifles.</h2>

      <p>Harris <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=gun%20control&amp;src=typed_query">told Harry Smith</a> ,”there are certain types of weapons that should not be on the streets of a civil society.”</p>
      <p>She pushed for a renewal of the 1994 “Assault Weapons” ban and the implementation of a government mandated buyback of AR-15s, AK-47s, and similar rifles.</p>
      <p>Harris described the semiautomatic firearms as “weapons of war” and said, “What we’ll do is have an incentive for people turn them in, and buy them back.”</p>

      <p>Harris suggested there are “five million ‘assault weapons’ on the streets of America,” an assertion which greatly underestimates Americans’ love for AR-15 rifles.</p>
      <p>On August 31, 2018, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/08/31/over-9-million-ar-15s-manufactured-us-sales-obama-presidency/">reported</a> that over 9 million AR-15s were manufactured for U.S. sales during the Obama presidency alone.</p>
      <p>The National Shooting Sports Foundation calculates there are <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/09/democrats-cant-deport-11-million-illegals-but-will-confiscate-16-million-ar-15s/">16 million-plus</a> privately owned AR-15s in the U.S.</p>
