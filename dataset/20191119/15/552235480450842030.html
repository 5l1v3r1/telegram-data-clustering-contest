        <b>Have you got the cutest, friendliest or most adorable pet in Stirlingshire?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everyone who owns a cat, dog, rabbit, lizard or gerbil may believe their little pal is the best in town.</p>
      <p>But now, the Stirling Observer is giving you the chance to prove it. We are launching our Pet Idol 2019 competition.</p>
      <p>It is the fifth time we have run Pet Idol and we canâ€™t wait to see snaps of your pet pals, big and small. We want you to send us pictures of your little furry, scaly or feathered friends in a celebration of all things animal.</p>
      <p>Pick up Wednesday's edition of the Stirling Observer for details on how to enter.</p>
