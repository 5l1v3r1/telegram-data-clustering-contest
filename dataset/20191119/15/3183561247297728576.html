      <h1>Disney+ Has More In Australia Than The US</h1>

      <p>Disney+ has landed on Australian shores and it's jam-packed with classics and soon-to-be favourites. Shocking everyone, however, Australians seem to be getting a lot more content than our U.S. counterparts. Here's what's available.</p>
      <p>I began this article looking for what Australians would be missing out on at Disney+'s launch but it was quickly flipped on its side. Turns out, Australians have way more available at launch than our friends across the Pacific. It seems that content deals between streaming services, like Netflix and Amazon, in the U.S. have meant Disney has had to suck it up and leave a number of titles available outside of its new home.</p>
      <p>We've reached out to Disney to confirm why it's had better success in Australia. It explained it had a lot to do with licencing agreements, which were likely made before plans for Disney+ were underway.</p>
      <p>"Our content does differ due to existing licensing commitments â€“ so content varies in each of the markets," a Disney spokesperson told us.</p>

      <h3>First, tell me what's missing on Australian Disney+ that's available in the United States</h3>
      <p>Right now, this list is incredibly small but we're working on filling it up as we come across them. For the time being, there's a few lone titles on it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>The Simpsons</i> (Season 30)</li>
        <li><i>Lizzie McGuire</i> (2001 series)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Season 31 of <i>The Simpsons</i> is not available in the U.S. either as it's still airing.</p>
      <h3>Okay so what content do Australians have that the U.S. doesn't?</h3>
      <p>While we're certainly used to missing out on content while our U.S. counterparts get to gobble it up, it seems Disney+ has made an exception this time around. This is by no means an exhaustive list but from what we can see at first glance, the following titles are available for Australians using the service but not for U.S. users.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Wrinkle in Time</li>
        <li>Alice Through the Looking Glass</li>

        <i>Note: Spider-Man live-action titles and Venom are owned by Sony Pictures but in 2015, Sony entered a partnership with Marvel to produce Homecoming and Far From Home. Relations have since allegedly soured and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20956671/disney-plus-marvel-spider-man-tom-holland-avengers-endgame-netflix-fox-xmen">Disney told The Verge</a> it's got no plans to add them on the service. A number of animated Spider-Man titles, produced by Marvel Films Animation, remain available on the platform.</i>
