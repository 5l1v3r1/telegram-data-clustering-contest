      <h1>'Ignore this whole thing': Fox News anchor implores Trump not to tweet during impeachment hearing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:18:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:18</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>A Fox News anchor is urging President Trump to hold back on using his Twitter account during impeachment hearings after he attacked former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-intelligence-committee-holds-second-public-hearing">Marie Yovanovitch</a> during her testimony.</p>
      <p><i>Fox and Friends </i>co-host Brian Kilmeade made the remarks after Trump’s tweets about Yovanovitch backfired when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/we-take-this-very-seriously-schiff-accuses-trump-of-witness-intimidation">characterized the tweets</a>, which <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/she-started-off-in-somalia-how-did-that-go-trump-mocks-former-us-ambassador-to-ukraine">blasted Yovanovitch’s service to the country</a>, as “witness intimidation.” The California Democrat read the tweets to Yovanovitch in real-time during Thursday’s impeachment hearing.</p>
      <p>Kilmeade’s advice was that Trump should disregard the hearings and let those in Congress, like Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins, handle the matter.</p>
      <p>“[The] president should just ignore this whole thing. Don’t tweet during it. Don't get outraged over it. It ticks you off,” Kilmeade said. “And I think there’s so much for him to do — I just think that let these guys, like Doug Collins and company, fight out and keep it on the straight and narrow, from the Republican perspective.”</p>
      <p>“You know who’s ignoring it Brian? The American public,” fellow co-host Steve Doocy added, going on to point out that ratings between the first and second days of public testimony dropped.</p>

      <p>Former independent counsel Ken Starr also criticized Trump’s tweets and said that he was showing “ <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ken-starr-trumps-tweet-during-yovanovitch-testimony-was-extraordinarily-poor-judgment">extraordinarily poor judgment</a>.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-intelligence-committee-holds-next-public-impeachment-hearing-featuring-vindman">Tuesday’s hearings</a> feature Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, a foreign service aide detailed to Vice President Pence's office. They will testify in the morning.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison, a former NSC aide, will testify beginning at 2:30 p.m EST.</p>
