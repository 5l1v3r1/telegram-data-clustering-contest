      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-lenovo">Lenovo </a>India on Tuesday launched ThinkBook -- a new sub-brand dedicated to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the country.</p>
      <p>The company has made two additions to the ThinkBook sub-brand with the ThinkBook 14 and ThinkBook 15 which will be available in the first week of December at a starting price of Rs 30,990.</p>
      <p>Backed by customer research, ThinkBook is specially designed for the SMBs, thus, providing a unique balance of premium metal design to appeal to the new workforce with business grade security and services.</p>
      <p>"Our vision of smarter technology for all is a world where every person and business has access to technology that enables them to achieve their own intelligent transformation.</p>
      <p>"The new wave of young business leaders expects their workplace devices to do more but with a minimalist look. ThinkBook is a perfect fit to fill this existing product gap in the SMB marketplace," Rahul Agarwal, CEO &amp; MD, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-lenovo">Lenovo </a>India, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>According to the company, the ThinkBook series allows growing firms to keep a competitive edge in attracting today's young tech-savvy executives with cool looking yet secure devices.</p>
      <p>Wrapped in a lightweight anodized aluminium chassis with a mineral grey finish, ThinkBook 14 and ThinkBook 15 are purposefully built with zinc-alloy hinges.</p>
      <p>The devices are powered by up to 10th Gen Intel Core i7 6-core processor.</p>
      <p>To facilitate fast file transfers, the ThinkBook 14 and ThinkBook 15 are built with a USB Type-C port to enhance the device's capability to get more done.</p>
      <p>Both the devices are also equipped with AMD Radeon 625 and 620 graphic cards, respectively.</p>
