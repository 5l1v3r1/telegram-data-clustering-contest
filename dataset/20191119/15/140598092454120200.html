      <h1>Scottish wildcats bred in captivity to be released into wild for first time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:03:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/simon-johnson/" target="_blank">Simon Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Scottish wildcats bred in captivity are to be released into the wild for the first time in a bid to save the critically endangered species, it has been announced.</p>
      <p>The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) has secured a £3.2 million EU LIFE grant to help fund a pioneering six-year project to breed and release the animals.</p>
      <p>The UK's first state of the art breeding centre for the species will be built at the conservation organisation's Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore in Inverness-shire.</p>
      <p>Up to 60 wildcats from the centre will be released in to sites in the Cairngorms National Park over three years from 2022.</p>
      <p>Conservationists said the £5.5 million Saving Wildcats recovery project could offer the species "a vital lifeline" <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/7605985/Scottish-wildcat-monitored-for-wildlife-project.html">after years of decline.</a></p>

      <p>A report published in February by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Cat Specialist Group concluded that there is no longer a viable population living naturally in Scotland.</p>
      <p>The Scottish wildcat is the only wild member of the cat family to survive in Britain. Hybridisation with feral and domestic cats poses the greatest threat to the species. </p>
      <p>Helen Senn, RZSS Head of Conservation and Science Programmes, said: "Wildcats are on the brink of extinction in Scotland but it’s not too late.</p>
      <p>"With funding in place, it is tremendously exciting to begin the UK’s first wildcat release project and bring together all the necessary resources and expertise to make it happen.</p>
      <p>"Using wildcats from the existing captive population, as well as cats from Europe to boost the gene pool, the reintroduction centre will provide a sustainable source of wildcats for years to come."</p>
      <p>She said the Cairngorms have historically been "key" for wildcats and the society was working to identify an initial release site.</p>
      <p>Further releases may take place in "other strategically important locations across Scotland", she said, with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/27/first-wildcat-kittens-new-reintroduction-project-released-england/">the potential for more south of the Border.</a></p>

      <p>RZSS will work with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Cairngorms National Park Authority, Forestry and Land Scotland, and European partners Norden’s Ark from Sweden and Spain’s Junta De Andalucía, which have led the successful recovery of the Iberian lynx.</p>
      <p>The society already runs<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/07/17/new-hope-worlds-rarest-feline-discovery-two-scottish-wildcat/"> a conservation breeding programme for wildcats</a> at it's Highland Wildlife Park attraction, producing a record seven kittens this season.</p>
      <p>The new centre will provide facilities for breeding, monitoring and training genetically tested wildcats with the aim of releasing them into the wild in areas where the threat of hybridisation has been removed.</p>
      <p>It will be entirely off show to the public. Once released, the animals will wear GPS collars so that they can be monitored.</p>
      <p>Martin Gaywood, SNH Species Projects Manager, said: "Now is the time for a public discussion on domestic and feral cat populations, and how we manage these, and the public will have an important role in helping minimise future hybridisation. </p>
      <p>"Responsible cat ownership, including microchipping, neutering and vaccinations, is one way we can help reduce devastating effects on wildcats."</p>
