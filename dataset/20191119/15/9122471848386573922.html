      <h1>Predicting Tonight’s College Football Playoff Rankings Top 10</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:37:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The latest College Football Playoff rankings will be released this evening. The rankings come out following an eventful Week 12.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s rankings will be at least a little different than last week’s, considering what happened on Saturday, with Minnesota losing at Iowa and Baylor losing to Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Alabama will also be an interesting team to watch, as the committee will have to judge the Crimson Tide without Tua Tagovailoa moving forward.</p>
      <p>Here’s our prediction for what tonight’s top 10 will look like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
        <li>Oklahoma</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
        <li>Penn State</li>
        <li>Florida</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The top three is extremely clear at this point. It’s LSU, Ohio State and Clemson in some order. There’s really no debating that.</p>
      <p>The No. 4 spot is where it gets interesting. Georgia probably has a strong hold on that spot for now, but the Bulldogs will need to beat LSU in the SEC Championship Game to stay inside the top four.</p>
      <p>Alabama, Oregon, Utah and Oklahoma all have a chance at getting the fourth spot if they win out. Penn State could jump right back into contention with a win at Ohio State on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will be out at 7 p.m. E.T. on ESPN.</p>
