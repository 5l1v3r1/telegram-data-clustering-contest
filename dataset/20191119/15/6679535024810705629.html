      <p>Belagavi-based non-governmental organisation Pyaas Founation has dredged and rejuvenated a lake in Bhavihal village. The lake is the main source of water for residents. Members of the foundation worked for two years to dredge and rejuvenate the water body. This is the eighth in the series of nine lakes rejuvenated by the foundation and handed over to water users.</p>
      <p>The lake, which is spread over five acres of land, had gone dry and was filled with silt. Residents of the drought-prone village of Bhavihal in Bailhongal taluk are completely dependent on the lake and were suffering from its reduced storage capacity. Apart from Bhavihal, the water from the lake helps farmers in Sampgoan, Yargappa and Nagnur villages. The foundation estimated that 16,000 people and 2,000 animals were dependent on the lake for drinking water and also irrigation.</p>
      <p>When the foundation took up the task of dredging the lake, philanthropist Vivek Prakash of the Oerlikon group came forward to finance the efforts. For him, it was a tribute to his father Rajendra Prakash, a former pro Vice-Chancellor of IIT Rourkee.</p>
      <p>Members of the foundation faced several difficulties while taking up the project, including lack of approach road to the worksite, erratic rainfall and soil conditions.</p>
      <p>After two years of work, the silt was removed and the lake was beautified. Following heavy rain this year, the lake is full to the brim. With the removal of silt and the increase in the height of the embankment, the water holding capacity of the lake has doubled. The tank bed has been covered with black soil and compressed to help retain water. Villagers expressed satisfaction and gratitude to those worked for it on the completion of work.</p>
      <p>KLE society chairman Prabhakar Kore handed over the management of the rejuvenated lake in Bhavihal to the residents of the village on Monday. Sri Allamprabhu Mahaswamiji , seer of Nagnur Mutt, was present. Preeti Kore, Abhimanyu Daga and other directors of the foundation were present.</p>
