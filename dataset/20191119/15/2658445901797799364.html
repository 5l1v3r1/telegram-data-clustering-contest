      <p>The University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan requires about N100 billion to turn things round for excellent healthcare delivery, it was learnt Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Chief Medical Director (CMD), Prof. Jesse Otegbayo, disclosed this while addressing reporters on the occasion of the 62nd anniversary of the health institution.</p>
      <p>Otegbayo said facilities have decayed in the hospital due to age, usage and expanded operation over the years which necessitate renewal, upgrade or complete overhaul for excellent service delivery.</p>
      <p>The CMD, who identified paucity of funds as the cause of the situation, called on public spirited Nigerians and corporate organizations to join the growing list of donors to the hospital.</p>
      <p>As top priority, Otegbayo listed equipment, water and power supply as the three areas the hospital is in dire need for its services to be fully seamless. He said advancement in medical technology has necessitated upgrade and sometimes, overhaul of the equipment being used in the hospital which the management is achieving gradually as it grapples with insufficient funds. “Some of our equipment are almost obsolete because new models have been developed.” He said.</p>
      <p>According to him, water supply is a major challenge in the hospital. He said uninterrupted water and electricity supply are multi-billion Naira projects which the hospital alone cannot tackle. He, however, disclosed that a little provision has been made for water project in the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>In spite of the challenges, Otegbayo said staff of the institution has been doing their best to ensure patients, students and other members of the hospital community enjoy the best services. He pointed out that the effectiveness of the services just earned the hospital an award as the best-managed tertiary hospital in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The CMD added that he has introduced several initiatives and measures that have boosted efficiency in the hospital since he took over as CMD in March this year.</p>

      <p>One of his outstanding achievements is the attraction of more donors to the hospital which has resulted in receipt of new equipment, buildings and other facilities as well as cash donations.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the General Overseer, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, commissioned a new dialysis machine he donated to the hospital. Adeboye also pledged another two machines before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The cleric said the UCH is a tertiary hospital that is central to healthcare delivery in Nigeria. He also acknowledged that turning around the hospital requires a humongous amount of money, hence the need for Nigerians and organizations to support it in every way possible.</p>
      <p>Adeboye prayed for all the patients and medical workers at the hospital, saying God will never allow them to be afflicted with a disease that will disgrace them.</p>
      <p>Other new donors, according to Otegbayo, include the family of the late Mr Neville Akinfenwa Akingbehin, the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) Women Wing of NASFAT, UCH Muslim community, Caritas Organization and the UCH branch of the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN).</p>
