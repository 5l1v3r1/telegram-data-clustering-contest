      <p>A property millionaire facing a driving ban has told a court that having to hire chauffeurs would be an "exceptional hardship".</p>
      <p>David Russell, 63, amassed 24 points on his driving licence after his £114,000 company <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/motoring/bentley-vs-orientexpress-fastest-suv-world-gives-luxurious/">Bentayga supercar</a> was repeatedly caught breaking the speed limit.</p>
      <p>Russell, the chief executive of a £271m property company in Manchester, tried to claim he knew nothing of the offences because letters to his address were not passed on by his housekeeper.</p>
      <p>He also tried to plea with magistrates not to disqualify him under "exceptional hardship", saying that when he was previously disqualified in 2006 he went through seven chauffeur.</p>
      <p>He told the court: "I was disqualified 14 to 15 years ago but it was virtually impossible to get chauffeurs to come and pick me up at half five, six in the morning.</p>
      <p>"In terms of hardship the last time I must have gone through five, six or seven chauffeurs - they didn't want to do the time and meetings would run over."</p>
      <p>He went on to argue that he would have to "restructure my hours to between 8.30am and 6.30pm", but added: "Business would suffer and I would start to think of laying off the staff."</p>
      <p>At Manchester magistrates court, JPs rejected Russell's plea not to disqualify him under "exceptional hardship" rules and banned him from driving for six months, fined him a total of £2,465 and warned he would face jail if he was seen behind the wheel of a car.</p>
      <p>During the hearing the clerk of the court said: "We all have to make arrangements for post to be looked when we're away. That's something between you and the secretary not the court."</p>
      <p>JPs added: "The bench does not accept your reasons for application for exceptional hardship. You are not allowed to sit at the wheel of a vehicle for six months. Driving without license and whilst disqualified is a very serious offence and those who do that may end up in prison."</p>
