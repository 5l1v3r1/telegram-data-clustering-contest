        <b>A brilliant penalty save by goalkeeper Farizal Marlias, helped hosts Malaysia keep a clean sheet against Indonesia in the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualifier game held on Tuesday. Malaysia also won 2-0, thanks to a brace from Safawi Rasid.</b>
      </p>
      <p>To add to Rasid’s heroics, Marlias made the penalty save for Malaysia in the 83rd minute, as you can see in the video below. Take a look:</p>

      <p>Indonesia were awarded the penalty due to Marlias’ foul in his own box, but the Johor Darul Ta’zim star made amends by saving Osas Saha’s rather tame shot.</p>
      <p>Osas Saha aimed his shot at the left bottom corner, but the 33-year-old shot-stopper dived in the right direction to grab the ball before it went in.</p>
      <p>In the 89th minute, Rasid almost scored his third goal of the game, as he cut inside from the right-wing before curling the ball towards the far corner. However, the ball hit the post and went out, much to his chagrin.</p>
      <p>That being said, Rasid’s brace was all that was enough to confirm the win for the Harimau Malaya. With the victory, they also moved to the second place in Group G of round two of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.</p>
