      <h1>Women SHGs to get impounded stray cattle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:17:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The corporation, which keeps impounded stray cattle in authorised cowsheds and release them on payment of fine by owners, has decided to hand them over to women self-help groups.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan said the urban local body, based on an instruction from Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, was impounding stray cattle and handing them over to cowsheds here. On payment of fine of â‚¹ 5,000 a cattle by the owner, the impounded animals are released.</p>
      <p>Since a good number of owners are yet to pay the fine to get their animals back, they are advised to do so before November 24, after which the unclaimed animals will be handed over to women self-help groups so that they can raise them as part of their income generation programme.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the corporation has decided to straight away give the impounded animals to women self-help groups hereafter instead of handing them over to cowshed and returning them back to owners on payment of fine. So, owners are advised to keep their domestic animals within their premises to avoid such action, he said.</p>
