      <h1>Schoolboy seamer Naseem Shah pitches up for debut in Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:23:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Teenage tearaways are part of the fabric of Pakistan cricket but schoolboy seamer Naseem Shah could redefine the term “wunderkind” if selected during the test series in Australia.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old from Lower Dir district on the border of Afghanistan would eclipse former home captain Ian Craig as the youngest test debutant on Australian soil. Craig took the field as a 17-year-old against South Africa in 1953, scoring a half-century at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
      <p>Naseem, with only seven first class matches under his belt, is the youngest of three teenagers competing for a pace bowling slot in the opening match at the Gabba on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Uncapped Muhammad Musa and another 19-year-old, Shaheen Afridi, who has three tests to his credit, are the other two jostling in a pace unit that also includes the more seasoned pair of Mohammad Abbas and Imran Khan.</p>
      <p>Coach Misbah-ul-Haq and his fellow selectors have been criticised by Pakistan media for placing too much expectation on such young shoulders, particularly against an ascendant team that thrives on home pitches.</p>
      <p>But the Pakistan staff believe boldness is key to transforming their seventh-ranked side into a global force.</p>
      <p>Gambling on youth has seen some of the nation’s emerging talents suffer bruising initiations in the past and ultimately end up left by the wayside.</p>
      <p>Yet it has also unearthed a number of gems.</p>
      <p>Waqar Younis, the country’s second-highest test wicket-taker after Wasim Akram, made his 1989 debut against India in Karachi a day before his 18th birthday.</p>
      <p>He took four wickets in the first innings and went on to amass 373 victims in a career of 87 matches.</p>
      <p>Now Pakistan’s bowling coach, Waqar said Naseem reminded him of Australia’s fiery fast bowler Dennis Lillee.</p>
      <p>“He’s got a very similar action. He’s not as big as Dennis — Dennis was a big guy — but when he gets it right, he’s a handful,” Waqar told local media last week.</p>

      <p>
        <b>NO BAGGAGE</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Australia seamer Pat Cummins, who took a match-winning seven-wicket haul as an 18-year-old debutant against South Africa, said Naseem’s inexperience could work for him.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes that’s almost better, when you start off a little bit naive,” Cummins told reporters.</p>
      <p>“You just want to go out and bowl fast and not be clouded by the baggage of a few long days in the dirt.”</p>
      <p>Naseem is carrying a heavy burden of grief, however, following the death of his mother last week.</p>
      <p>He was offered the chance to head home but elected to stay with the Pakistan group to fulfil his family’s wishes for his career, team management said.</p>
      <p>After missing a day of the tour game against Australia A while on compassionate leave, he returned to the side and bowled eight overs, dismissing test opener Marcus Harris with a brutal, rising delivery.</p>
      <p>With the Gabba usually serving up a fast and bouncy wicket, Naseem could hardly ask for a better pitch for his first test outing if handed a cap.</p>
      <p>Head coach Misbah says Naseem could be the tour’s “surprise package” but warned the 16-year-old not to get too carried away with the fire and brimstone against players of the calibre of master batsman Steve Smith.</p>
      <p>“Naseem is a fine bowler, a young bowler, but at the same time cricket discipline remains the same,” Misbah told reporters.</p>
      <p>“No matter how quick you are, I think if you execute your plans well, then you have a chance.”  </p>
