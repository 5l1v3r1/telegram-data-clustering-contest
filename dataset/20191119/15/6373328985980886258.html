      <h1>Nearly Every Mass Shooter Since 1966 Has Had Four Things In Common</h1>

        <b>A superlative US government-funded study of mass shooters has found nearly all perpetrators since 1966 have four traits in common. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The findings were compiled by The Violence Project, ‘a nonpartisan think tank dedicated to reducing violence in society and improving related policy and practice through research and analysis’.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice-funded endeavour looked to analyse every ‘mass murder’ – in accordance with the FBI’s definition, where four or more people are killed in a public place excluding the shooter – to provide a ‘better understanding or preventing mass shootings’.</p>

      <p>The widely-spread stereotype for a mass shooter is that of a white male with a history of mental health issues and/or domestic violence. While that is no doubt true in some cases, The Violence Project nailed down four particular traits recurring among those listed in its database.</p>
      <p>
        <b>As per the study, the traits are: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Although mass shooters have different profiles, nearly all mass shooters have four things in common: (1) early childhood trauma and exposure to violence at a young age; (2) an identifiable grievance or crisis point; (3) validation for their beliefs, have studied past shootings to find inspiration; and (4) the means to carry out an attack.<br/><br/>Each one of the four themes represents an inflection point – an opportunity for intervention.</blockquote>
      <p>Researchers used the <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/husband-shocked-as-hundreds-attend-funeral-of-wife-killed-in-el-paso-shooting/">University of Texas shooting</a> in 1966 as a starting point, when a former Eagle Scout and Marine shot and killed 15 people from an observation deck at the Austin campus.</p>

      <p>While there were other incidents prior to this day, ‘what set the Texas clocktower shooting apart was that it unfolded live over the radio and the new medium of television – reporters on the scene described the events as they happened’.</p>
      <p>The findings of the study are terrifying: of the 167 incidents logged, 20% have occurred in the last five years, and half since 2000.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The study elaborates: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The fact that mass shootings account for fewer than 1% of all firearm homicides does not diminish their extraordinary tragedy – mass shootings cause damage and devastation far beyond that which is measured in lives lost.<br/><br/>Mass shootings are focusing events. And while they are statistically rare… in the US they are certainly routine.</blockquote>
      <p>In the past five years, the number of mass shootings driven by racism, religious hate and misogyny has increased dramatically – for example, there’s the Charleston church shooting, in which nine African Americans were killed.</p>

      <p>The study was also careful to point out while mental health is a factor – two-thirds had a documented history of mental health issues – it can’t be attributed as the main cause.</p>
      <p>While 70% of shooters were suicidal before or after the shooting, the percentage of shooters whose actions were directly influenced by symptoms of a mental disorder, such as hallucinations via psychosis, was roughly 16%.</p>
      <p>Jillian Peterson, a psychologist at Hamline University and co-author of the study, told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a35mya/nearly-all-mass-shooters-since-1966-have-had-four-things-in-common?utm_source=vicenewsfacebook"><i>Vice</i></a> the findings ‘shows us that there are opportunities for intervention – this doesn’t just happen out of the blue’.</p>

      <p>‘We know a lot more about suicide prevention than we do about this issue, and we know what works – things like limiting access to weapons, directly asking the question, connecting people with outside resources, not talking about it in the news,’ Peterson added.</p>
      <p>While acknowledging there is no single profile for a mass shooter, researchers found certain individual characteristics were often tied to the <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/life/chilling-ad-by-sandy-hook-promise-features-kids-using-school-supplies-during-a-shooting/">particular locations of an incident</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The study lists five categories: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>1. K-12 school shooter: a white male student of the school with a history of trauma who is suicidal. Leaks his plans ahead of time, high degree of planning, and has an interest in guns. Uses multiple guns that he stole from a family member.<br/><br/>2. College and university shooter: a non-white male current student with a history of violence and childhood trauma who is suicidal. Uses handguns that he legally obtained and leaves something behind to be found (like a video or ‘manifesto’).<br/><br/>3. Workplace shooter: a male in his 40s, no racial profile, but is an employee of the blue-collar shooting site and having trouble at work. Uses a handgun and assault rifles that he legally owns.<br/><br/>4. House of worship shooter: a white male in his 40s who is suicidal with a prior criminal record and violent history. Uses in a handgun in a Christian church where he knows victims. Low degree of planning, motivated by domestic spillage and hate.<br/><br/>5. Retail/restaurant/bar shooter: a white man, aged 30, with a criminal record and violent history and no connection to the location. Uses one legally owned handgun. One-third show evidence of a thought disorder.</blockquote>
