      <p>Alan Shearer has included four Liverpool players in his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> team of the season so far, while only Kevin De Bruyne makes the cut from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>’s squad.</p>
      <p>After 12 games played, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side remain unbeaten and are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>City, meanwhile, find themselves nine points behind their title rivals following their 3-1 defeat at Anfield before the international break.</p>
      <p>And as a result, Shearer believes only De Bruyne has been good enough to take a place in his Premier League team of the season so far.</p>

      <p>Sheffield United currently sit fifth in the Premier League after an excellent start and two of their players are included – Dean Henderson and centre-back John Egan.</p>
      <p>They are joined in defence by Liverpool’s star full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, while Leicester City’s Caglar Soyuncu makes up the back line.</p>

      <p>And in attack, Shearer has gone for a two-man front line as Tammy Abraham partners Jamie Vardy.</p>
