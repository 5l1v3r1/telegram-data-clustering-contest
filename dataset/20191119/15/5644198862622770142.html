      <p>LAHORE: Pakistan's ailing ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif left by air ambulance on Tuesday (Nov 19) for London, where he is due to receive medical treatment after <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/ailing-pakistan-ex-pm-sharif-seeks-permission-to-travel-abroad-12076962">battling the government for permission to travel</a>, his doctor and close aides said.</p>
      <p>Sharif, 69, is suffering from an autoimmune blood disorder, has high blood pressure, and his kidney functions are deteriorating, according to aides. His doctor has said he is "fighting for his life".</p>

      <p>He had been in prison serving a sentence for corruption, but was bailed last month to receive treatment. Since then his party and family have been fighting to get his name removed from a travel stop list to allow him to go overseas for treatment.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The government of Sharif's rival Imran Khan had said it would not stand in the way, but last week demanded he pay a bond of seven billion Pakistani rupees (US$45 million) as a condition of his travel - which Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), immediately rejected.</p>
      <p>After days of political deadlock the condition was finally lifted and Sharif was flown to London via Doha on a Qatar Airways air ambulance.</p>
      <p>Party workers showered rose petals on his car as it left his house on the outskirts of the eastern city of Lahore.</p>
      <p>Senior PML-N member Pervaiz Rasheed confirmed to reporters that Sharif was en route to London.</p>
      <p>Sharif's aides have said the unexplained cause and uncertain diagnosis of his illness require advanced investigations and specialised care.</p>
      <p>The courts have granted him four weeks to receive treatment, though that can be extended pending medical advice.</p>
      <p>Known as the "Lion of Punjab", Sharif is a political survivor who has repeatedly roared back to the country's top office. He served three terms - but did not complete a single one.</p>
      <p>His first, beginning in 1990, ended in 1993 when he was sacked for corruption. The second lasted from 1997 to 1999, when he was deposed by the powerful military.</p>
      <p>Sharif blamed the security establishment for again targeting him in 2017 when the Supreme Court disqualified him from politics for life over graft allegations, which he denies.</p>
