      <p>Fast food giants KFC have made their bid for the title of<a href="https://www.kfc.co.uk/our-food/for-one/box-meals/festive-burger"> best seasonal menu</a> with three new festive items - and no turkey in sight. </p>
      <p>Launched on Monday in restaurants across the UK and Ireland the refreshed menu now features a KFC Festive Burger, Festive Fries and a Mint Choc Krushem Soft Ice Cream dessert.</p>
      <p>The £4.59 Festive Burger sees an Original Recipe chicken fillet paired with a hash brown, sage and onion stuffing mayo, cranberry sauce and a layer of cheese to boot. </p>
      <p>For those wishing to supersize, the burger is also available as part of KFC’s Festive Box Meal, which includes beans, a chicken drumstick, a drink and the Festive Fries - seasoned with pepper, toasted onions, herbs and garlic - for £6.89.</p>
      <p>If customers still have room for dessert, the Mint Choc Krushem Soft Serve is available for only £2.79. </p>
      <p>It combines vanilla ice cream, drizzled with chocolate and mint sauce, sprinkled with Cookie Crunch and bedecked with a glittery chocolate bow tie. </p>
      <p>The new menu is available from KFC locations until 1 January 2020, so there’s plenty of time to get a festive fix.</p>
      <p>“A round of santa-plause for this epic festive feast please,” said Jo Tivers, Senior New Project Development Team Leader for KFC.  </p>
      <p>“We’ll let turkey have its moment on the 25th but until then, we’ve got your back.”</p>
      <p>KFC aren't the only eating establishments to get in on the Christmas spirit.</p>
      <p>Bailey's <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/baileys-freakshake-cake-christmas-where-to-buy-salted-caramel-a9146046.html">recently launched</a> their salted caramel and hot chocolate flavour cakes for the festive period, while McDonald's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mcdonalds-christmas-menu-2019-sees-20912593">2019 Christmas menu</a> has seen the return of the infamous 'Big Tasty' burger, the Chicken Deluxe and camembert cheese dippers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nando's in Glasgow decided they would embrace the generosity this Christmas instead of gluttony, by opening on Christmas Day to serve <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/nando-s-glasgow-homeless-christmas-day-open-feed-a9184021.html">homeless individuals for free</a>. </p>
