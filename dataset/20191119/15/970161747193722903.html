      <p>Rihanna might seem absolutely flawless, but it turns out there’s one thing she’s bad at – well, according to Seth Meyer’s anyway.</p>
      <p>When appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the 45-year-old opened up on his iconic day drinking session with the Umbrella hitmaker – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/21/rihanna-dishes-out-x-rated-advice-to-help-seth-meyes-blow-his-wife-away-on-date-night-10024208/">which saw her dish out some X-rated advice.</a></p>
      <p>But while gushing over the pop star, he also threw some shade in her direction, as he teased that she’s bad at taking pictures.</p>
      <p>Jimmy prompted his confession when he asked the comedian whether or not there’s anything she’s bad at.</p>

      <p>‘Yes,’ Seth smirked: ‘At one point she took my phone and took a bunch of pictures while we were day drinking.’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘And then when I went through them, I was like, “Rihanna is bad at taking pictures.”‘</p>
      <p>You know, despite those seemingly perfect selfies!</p>
      <p>But despite not getting a good shot to remember the day by, it seems the star’s memories were more than enough to keep him going.</p>
      <p>‘It was beyond my wildest dreams,’ he said of their time together: ‘We went day drinking. Why would you say yes to that? But it was amazing.’</p>
      <p>The father-of-two added: ‘People have asked, “What was it like drinking with Rihanna?”</p>

      <p>‘You know, like there’s some people where the more you drink over the course of the night, the more they start looking like Rihanna, imagine starting there!’</p>
      <p>He laughed: ‘You know what I mean? But she was so much fun and is the nicest person in the world and it was a blast.’</p>
      <p>When asked if he managed to get her phone number, Seth chuckled: ‘I wouldn’t want it, I think it would be too dangerous to have, I think I’d spend all day like, “Whats a funny thing to send Rihanna?”‘</p>
      <p>But while she might be bad at taking photos, it seems the 31-year-old is even worse at dropping new music, as lo and behold we’re still waiting on an album.</p>

      <p>Teasing a little bit about her ninth studio album, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/rihannas-new-album-r9-will-reggae-inspired-reggae-always-feels-right-10890229/">the singer recently revealed that it will be reggae-inspired.</a></p>
      <p>‘I like to look at it as a reggae-inspired or reggae-infused album,’ she explained to Vogue. ‘It’s not gonna be typical of what you know as reggae. But you’re going to feel the elements in all of the tracks.’</p>
