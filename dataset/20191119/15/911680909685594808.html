      <p>FLORENCE, AZ â€” Pinal County Sheriff's Office has released a statement about the number of bomb threats that have been falsely made over the last few weeks, warning students to stop or they will be charged.</p>
      <p>"First, a threat was found written in a bathroom. The second, made on social media. And on Monday, the third was also found in a bathroom," PCSO said in a letter posted online. "While all three threats have been found not to be credible, PCSO takes all of them seriously. A student can face felony charges, even if they are minor."</p>
      <p>According to the letter: "In the first two instances, PCSO has arrested two separate students. The first is facing charges of Terroristic Threats and Disruption of an Educational Institution. The second was booked for Disruption of an Educational Institution."</p>

      <p>"Making a threat like this can affect a student for the rest of their lives. I urge parents to talk to their children about the choices they make. They need to know it is never OK to make a joke about bringing a gun or bomb to their school," Sheriff Mark Lamb said.</p>
