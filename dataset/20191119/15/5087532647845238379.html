      <h1>Thousands of Disney+ Accounts Hacked and Being Sold Online</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:22:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/charlotte-henry/" target="_blank">Charlotte Henry</a></address>
      <p>Streaming glitches aren’t the only tech problems to have beset Disney+, it seems. <i>ZDNet</i> found that almost immediately thousands of users’ credentials were being sold online.</p>
      <blockquote>Two users who spoke with ZDNet on the condition we do not share their names admitted that they reused passwords. However, other users said online that they did not, and had used passwords unique for their Disney+ accounts. This suggests that in some cases hackers gained access to accounts by using email and password combos leaked at other sites, while in other cases the Disney+ credentials might have been obtained from users infected with keylogging or info-stealing malware. The speed at which hackers have mobilized to monetize Disney+ accounts is astounding. Accounts were put up for sale on hacking forums within hours after the service’s launch. As of this article’s writing, hacking forums have been flooded with Disney+ accounts, with ads offering access to thousands of account credentials.</blockquote>
