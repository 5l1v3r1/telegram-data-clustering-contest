      <p>The Houston Astros are under major investigation by Major League Baseball over allegations that they cheated during the 2017 season — mainly by stealing signs — and a recent video can serve as proof.</p>
      <p>It’s been said by former Astros players that the team used video and other technology to steal signs, and MLB is currently looking into it. However, a number of video clips have already emerged which back up their claims.</p>
      <p>First, a few different videos appear to show <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/13/shocking-video-of-astros-cheating-during-games-emerges/">Astros players banging on a trash can in the dugou</a>t to signify if it’s either a fastball or offspeed pitch — some of them even resulting in home runs. [In case you missed it, you can <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/13/shocking-video-of-astros-cheating-during-games-emerges/">watch it in full here</a>.]</p>
      <p>And now, a new video from Game 5 of the 2017 World Series shows Astros players walking by a table with video monitors and laptops on it. It’s clear the table was in use, as sunflower seeds were on it, as well as the floor.</p>
