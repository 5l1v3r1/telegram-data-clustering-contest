      <p>Strictly Come Dancing has revealed the dance routine line-up for this week’s show – but it’s judge Bruno Tonioli that has a surprise up his sleeve (and we literally can’t wait for it).</p>
      <p>This Saturday Strictly fans will be excited to know that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saffron-barker/">Saffron Barker</a> and AJ Pritchard will be dancing the Samba to Walking on Sunshine, while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancings-oti-mabuse-thanks-kelvin-fletcher-for-bringing-mum-to-blackpool-in-sweet-surprise-11169118/">Kelvin Fletcher will be performing a street dance to Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)</a> with partner Oti Mabuse.</p>
      <p>But it’s judge Bruno that viewers won’t be able to take their eyes off (see what I did there?) – as he will be performing a live rendition of Can’t Take My Eyes Off You, accompanied by a dance from the show’s team of professionals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancing-fans-gutted-michelle-visage-eliminated-facing-saffron-barker-dance-off-11172457/">Last weekend saw </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancing-fans-gutted-michelle-visage-eliminated-facing-saffron-barker-dance-off-11172457/"> eliminated from the show after landing at the bottom of the leaderboard after scoring 32 points</a> – and Strictly fans were less than impressed.</p>

      <p>And while we’d hoped that fan power could’ve saved the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rupauls-drag-race/">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> judge, it wasn’t to be, with the 51-year-old Michelle facing her second consecutive bottom two as she faced off against a teary eyed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saffron-barker/">Saffron Barker</a> in the dreaded dance off.</p>

      <p>With both celebs having been pegged for the final, the audience was naturally shocked by the bottom two, while the judges unanimously chose – despite Craig Revel Horwood calling the choice ‘really difficult’ – to save 19-year-old Saffron.</p>
      <p>However, despite saying goodbye to Strictly and her partner Giovanni Pernice, Michelle seemed not to regret her decision to bring voguing to Blackpool.</p>

      <p>‘We wanted to take a risk for Couple’s Choice,’ she told Tess Daly.</p>
      <p>‘We love dancing Ballroom, we love doing our Latin but we wanted to bring something different for Couple’s Choice and do a dance with a mission statement behind it and we’re really proud.’</p>
