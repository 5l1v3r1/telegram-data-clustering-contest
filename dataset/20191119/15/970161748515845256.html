      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sherlock/">Sherlock</a> co-creators Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat have admitted that there are no immediate plans to bring the hit show back to screens – but they did try to bring another famous detective back to the small screen.</p>
      <p>The writers just can’t seem to get enough of re-boots and re-imaginings, they’re also bringing everyone’s favourite vampire, Dracula. back in a limited series on BBC.</p>
      <p>But viewers hoping to see the duo’s most famous work – their modern-day re-interpretation of Sherlock Holmes with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/benedict-cumberbatch/">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> and Martin Freeman – back on screen soon will be very disappointed.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-11-18/sherlock-return-mark-gatiss/">Radio Times</a>, Gatiss admitted that after series 4 of the hit crime drama aired just under two years ago, there aren’t yet any plans in place for a resurrection.</p>
      <p>‘You could go back,’ the League of Gentleman star theorised. ‘But there are no immediate plans.’</p>

      <p>Interestingly enough, however, the duo did reveal that they spent a very long time trying to bring another very well known fictional detective back to life – Columbo, the American detective played by actor Peter Falk for 10 seasons and well over 30 years.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> showrunner Moffat said: ‘I really tried with Columbo, I did have a decent go at it, but the rights are really tied up.</p>

      <p>‘But the one thing Columbo has to be is the most unprepossessing, seemingly unimpressive sadist you’ll ever meet.</p>
      <p>‘All that ‘Oh, just one more thing’ stuff isn’t absent-mindedness. He’s such a sadist.’</p>
      <p>Well, quite. And these guys have quite literally written a Dracula adaption, so they know a thing or two about sadists by now, we imagine.</p>

      <p>Speaking of Dracula – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/27/first-trailer-bbc-netflixs-dracula-series-looks-completely-terrifying-10993158/">the first trailer for the new series has dropped</a> and we’re already obsessed and, yes, slightly creeped out too.</p>

      <p>Speaking of the new adaption, Gatiss also admitted that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/sherlocks-benedict-cumberbatch-helped-inspire-new-terrifying-dracula-adaption-11013440/">Benedict Cumberbatch’s famous portrayal of Sherlock helped shaped the new vampire horror</a>. ”‘</p>
