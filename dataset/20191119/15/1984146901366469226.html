      <p>A fan of cleaning guru Mrs Hinch has shared a simple cleaning hack that left her shocked at the amount of hair hiding in her carpets.</p>
      <p>Posting on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/263873787588466/?ref=group_header">Hinch Army Cleaning Tips Facebook page</a> , mum Manda Good said her carpet was looking dull no matter how much she Hoovered.</p>
      <p>But thanks to a simple 59p trick, it was looking good as new - once a giant hairball had been removed.</p>
      <p>"You lovely Hinchers have done it again. I have a lovely silver grey carpet which lately has become a bit dull and I’m always hoovering but it had lost its lovely look," Manda wrote.</p>
      <p>"I saw the post about trapped hair and how hoovering doesn’t get it out. So I bought a squeegee for 59p and gave it a go."</p>
      <p>The results were impressive.</p>
      <p>"This is my daughter's bedroom carpet. She has very long hair. I was totally shocked at how much came up and a bit disgusted to be honest," Manda wrote.</p>
      <p>"My carpet now looks brand new again! If you haven’t tried it yet do it!"</p>
      <p>And hundreds of other Mrs Hinch fans were just as impressed with the tactic.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "I do this every week now. Amazing how much hair and dust comes up. Only thing is my squeegee doesn't last long."</p>
      <p>Another added: "I do my stairs often and the amount that comes off is crazy!"</p>
      <p>There were also tips, to make the job even easier.</p>
      <p>"You can get a rubber brush (Home Bargains) which makes the job much easier," One wrote.</p>
      <p>Another added: "I've also got a hideous pair of rubber sliders that are used specifically for this. They clean the carpet and it's a work out to boot."</p>
