      <h1>Firefighters rescue girl, 2, trapped in this recalled Argos baby stair gate</h1>
      <h2>Argos recalled their Cuggl range last week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:36:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>A two-year-old has had to be freed by firefighters after getting stuck in a baby stairgate that has just been recalled.</p>
      <p>The child, who has not been named, managed to get their leg stuck in the bars of the Cuggl stairgate.</p>
      <p>Firefighters said they used ‘muscle power’ to bend the bars apart to release her leg, but added their voice to the calls for parents to check their baby gates and take them back if they are the specific brand.</p>
      <p>Argos announced last week that they are recalling seven Cuggl stairgates for failing <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/european-union">key EU safety tests</a>, including one which ensures the bars are not too far apart.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/kingswood">Kingswood</a> Fire Station said they were called to a house in east Bristol by a parent who couldn’t free their child from the stair gate.</p>
      <p>“We have just rescued a two-year-old child from this stair gate,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We used muscle power to bend the bars apart to release her leg.</p>

      <p>“The parent was on her way to take it back due to a recall for the bars being too far apart!” he said, adding that parents should check their stairgate isn’t on the recalled list.</p>
      <p>Argos sell the Cuggl stair gates and<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/popular-stair-gate-brands-fail-2927926"> earlier this year recalled two</a> for failing key tests for EU safety standards.</p>
      <p>They removed those models from sale at the time, and after an investigation by the consumer magazine Which?, Argos said it had carried out further ‘intensive independent testing’ of its entire Cuggl range.</p>
      <p>An Argos spokesperson said, “We are very sorry to hear about this incident.</p>
      <p>"Product safety is our number one concern, which is why we recalled these stairgates after independent testing highlighted potential safety issues.</p>
      <p>"We urge parents and carers with one of these stairgates to stop using it immediately and return it to an Argos store for a full refund," he said.</p>
      <h3>What are the problems?</h3>
      <p>Argos says there is a risk of the following problems occurring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brackets or wooden slats breaking under high impact</li>
        <li>Regular banging or kicking of the gate, for example the auto-close feature failing</li>
        <li>The gaps between metal bars being wider than the required standard, which could lead to a child getting trapped</li>
      </ul>
