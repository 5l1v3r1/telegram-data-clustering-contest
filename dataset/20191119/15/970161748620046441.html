      <p>Winter can be a testing time for motorists in the UK, with iced up being windows often becoming a daily bugbear.</p>
      <p>It’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/27/prick-drives-like-end-fine-7345576/">illegal to drive with only part of the window de-frosted</a>, but it’s also a pain in the fingers having to scrape off all the ice conventionally.</p>
      <p>But there is actually a substance on the market that can help you to keep your windows clear of frost for up to six months.</p>
      <p>Called Duxback, it was developed for the airline industry and is applied on Boeing cockpit glass, but is now being marketed for motorists as well.</p>
      <p>It works by making water ‘bead’ on glass, meaning that not only does it stop ice from forming, but because it is a ‘hydrophobic’ substance it also helps with visibility when it is raining.</p>

      <p>The manufacturers claim that at 40mph drivers won’t have to use their wipers as the droplets just fall off the windscreen.</p>

      <p>On top of all that, it is also claimed that Duxback can also make it a lot easier to remove bugs from your windscreen.</p>
      <h3>Other ways to get ice off your windscreen this winter</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The sandwich bag trick</b>
      </p>
      <p>Putting hot water in a sandwich bag and simply sliding it across the windscreen is a quick and safe way to defrost your car – with some even calling it ‘revolutionary’ on social media.</p>
      <p>Daniel Harris shared the trick to his Facebook and wrote: ‘Hot water in a food bag and bam you’ve got a de-icer and a hand warmer. Works a treat, and it’s fast.’</p>
      <p>Just pour hot water from your tap, so you can safely hold it and lower the risk of cracking your screen, to a sandwich bag and swipe it across your windscreen.</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk tried it and it really does work, just make sure to have a cloth ready to wipe off the melted water.</p>

      <h3>An old towel</h3>
      <p>All you need to stop your windshield from freezing is an old towel, water and table salt.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Mix the salt with the water and soak the towel in the solution.</p>
      <figure>
        <video src="https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/met/2016/11/23/271956320888702556/1024x576_MP4_271956320888702556.mp4"/>

      <p>Place the wet towel on your windscreen so that it covers the window, and leave it on overnight.</p>
      <p>When you wake up in the morning, your window should be ice-free.</p>
      <h3>How to de-ice your car</h3>
      <p>If a frosty window has taken you by surprise, then you can <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2015/11/23/youve-been-deicing-your-car-all-wrong-heres-how-to-clear-your-windshield-5519734/">de-ice your car</a> by using a saltwater solution and wiping or spraying it on the glass.</p>
      <p>Make sure you avoid the metal parts of your car, as salt is corrosive.</p>
      <p>Instead of salt, you can also use surgical spirit or any strong alcohol you’ve got lying around – in this case, the mixture should be two parts alcohol, one part water.</p>

      <p>If your house is teetotal, white vinegar will also do the trick – the mixture should be three parts white vinegar and one part water.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Spraying this mixture on the glass the night before should also work as a way to stop the window from freezing up overnight in the first place.</p>
      <p>If you decide to scrape the ice off your car, avoid using things like credit cards, as they could scratch the glass.</p>
      <p>Don’t use hot water as the sharp temperature change could cause the glass to crack, and using a hairdryer to melt the ice on your window is dangerous as it could result in electrocution.</p>

      <h3>The AA recommends:</h3>
      <p>Get up at least 10 minutes early to give you time to prepare the car.</p>
      <p>Don’t drive off like a tank-commander, with a tiny hole cleared in the windscreen. Clear all windows using a scraper and de-icer.</p>
      <p>Use a cigarette lighter to warm a key for a frozen lock. Don’t breathe on the lock, as the moisture will condense and freeze.</p>
      <p>Plan routes to favour major roads which are more likely to have been cleared and gritted.</p>
      <p>Put safety before punctuality when the bad weather closes in. Allow extra time for winter journeys but be prepared for the inevitability of being late for work due to unexpected delay.</p>
      <h3>Why does my car freeze on the inside?</h3>
      <p>If your car is freezing on the inside, that could be a sign that there’s too much moisture in the air inside your car.</p>
      <p>To stop this from happening, you can leave one of your windows open just a crack, provided you keep your car in a garage or similarly dry place.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>You can also leave absorbent things such as rice pr cat litter in your car to soak up any excess moisture. Alternatively, you could buy a disposable dehumidifier.</p>
      <h3>How to stop screenwash freezing</h3>
      <p>There are screenwash brands you can use, such as <a href="https://www.halfords.com/motoring/engine-oils-fluids/screenwash-de-icer/halfords--30-concentrated-screenwash-2l-cherry">Halfords -30 Concentrated Screenwash</a>, which promise to not re-freeze on your screen when used neat.</p>
