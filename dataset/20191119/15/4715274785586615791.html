      <p>Through its nationwide network of 19 bottling plants, employee volunteers, and NGO partners such as the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, Caritas Manila, and other organizations, the Coca-Cola System has thus far provided over 115,000 liters of Wilkins™ water to communities severely hit by the devastating earthquakes. </p>

      <p>From day zero, Coca-Cola mobilized its resources to contribute to the relief efforts. Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, Inc. President and CEO Gareth McGeown, with CCBPI’s local Davao team, led the delivery of Wilkins™ water to the hardest-hit areas in Magsaysay, Davao del Sur; they were received by Magsaysay Mayor Arthur Davin. Wilkins™ water was likewise distributed to Digos, Davao del Sur; and Tulunan, Kidapawan, Makilala, and Magpet, in Cotabato. More Wilkins™ water— close to 34,560 liters—are on their way from nearby Coca-Cola bottling plants and distribution centers.</p>
