      <p>A repeat offender from Airdrie who drove while more than four times the legal alcohol limit has been banned from the road for four years.</p>
      <p>Thomas Higgins, 31, had 94mg of alcohol in his system when approached by police officers on Coatbank Street on July 6. The legal limit is only 22mg.</p>
      <p>The procurator fiscal said: “At 12.55am police saw a vehicle in a car park and spoke to the accused.</p>
      <p>“He was under the influence of alcohol, which could be smelled from him, and his speech was slurred.</p>
      <p>“He was arrested and taken to the police office.”</p>

      <p>Sheriff Frank Pieri told Clement Drive resident Higgins: “This is an extremely high reading and you also have two previous convictions.</p>
      <p>“I’ll impose an alternative to custody despite your persistent offending.</p>
      <p>“You’ll be under supervision for one year and carry out 135 hours of unpaid work. You’re also banned from driving for four years.</p>
      <p>“If you breach this, you could be jailed.”</p>
