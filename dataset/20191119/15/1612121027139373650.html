      <p>With the new Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker film coming to a cinema near you on December 20, Samsung has announced a special edition of its <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342838-samsung-waters-down-the-note-line-with-the-note-10-launch/">Galaxy Note 10+</a> to get in on the action. Complete with digital content, a collectors badge, a red S Pen, a specially designed case, and a set of Galaxy buds, the bundle naturally also features a Galaxy Note 10+ with a custom design.</p>

      <p>The digital content includes Star Wars-themed wallpapers, shutdown animations, icons, and sounds. There’s no word on whether detaching the S Pen will result in the same sound as drawing a lightsaber, but one can hope. It’s a shame that Samsung skipped from the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/260784-samsung-has-no-plans-to-bring-the-galaxy-note-5-to-the-uk-or-europe-in-2015/">Galaxy Note 5</a> to the (disastrous) <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/301165-samsung-investigating-faulty-galaxy-note-7-battery-explosion-recall/">Note 7</a> because it could have really gotten into the Star Wars lark by announcing the <i>Sith</i> Edition of the Galaxy Note. That being said, the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/308542-heres-why-the-galaxy-note-7-exploded/">Galaxy Note 7</a> did threaten to become the Death Star more than once with its explosive antics.</p>
      <p>The special edition of the Galaxy Note 10+ will be available in Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Korea, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UAE, UK and the USA from December 13 onwards. As for pricing, it’s believed that the Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars Special Edition bundle will cost around $1,300.</p>
      <p>Are you thinking of splashing the cash and buying the $1,300 Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars Special Edition? And if so, would you actually use the handset or would you leave it wrapped and unused as an investment? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>
