      <p>Podcasts. Still all the rage these days. And while Apple has been leading the charge for accessing that content, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/spotify/">Spotify</a> is starting to put some <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/07/31/spotify-to-promote-podcast-established-producers/">real effort</a> in the game.</p>
      <p>And that continues with the brand new “Your Daily Podcasts” playlist. Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-11-19/your-daily-podcasts-playlist-makes-finding-your-next-favorite-show-easier-than-ever/">just announced</a> the newest playlist to its lengthy options, with this one designed to use its well known algorithm to help you find your next favorite show, rather than your next favorite song or artist.</p>
      <p>As suggested by the title, this is a daily podcast playlist, and, as such, it will be refreshed on a daily basis. To make that possible, and a playlist actually worth checking in on, it will surface new content the service believes you’ll like, but also help you stay up-to-date on your current favorites as well.</p>
      <p>That listening history starts with a podcast you’ve listened to. Spotify says that if you’ve listened to four podcasts within the last 90 days, that content will show up “Your Top Podcasts” shelf in the Home section, or in the “Made For You” section while you browse.</p>
      <blockquote>Here’s how Your Daily Podcasts works:<br/>  1. Spotify’s algorithms analyze your podcast behavior—like recent streams and follows.<br/>  2. Then, based on your listening history and the podcast type, we’ll recommend the next best episodes for you.<br/>  3. That might be the next sequential episode in a podcast you’re already listening to (think Dog Tales and How’s Work with Esther Perel), a recent stand-alone evergreen episode in another show (maybe Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls 1 Keith or Certified Buckets), or a timely episode from a daily updating podcast (like Horoscope Today or The Journal).<br/>  4. Don’t worry—no spoilers here! If you’ve never listened to a story-driven sequential show we think you’d like, you’ll get the trailer or pilot episode first—to see if it catches your eye (er, ear).</blockquote>
      <p>The new podcasts playlist is available starting today for free and Premium Spotify subscribers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. Spotify doesn’t mention if the playlist will expand to additional countries in the future.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned above, this is just one of the many moves that Spotify has made in the podcasts market. Back in September of this year, for instance, the service launched the ability to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/09/30/spotify-add-podcast-playlists/">make playlists</a> built with podcasts, something that makes listening to one show and then another, based on what you want to hear, even easier.</p>
      <p>This is a pretty solid new addition to Spotify’s borderline ridiculous number of playlists it offers. And for anyone who is a fan of podcasts, it sound like an easy way to not only keep tabs on the shows you already like, but hopefully find new content worth listening to. And considering how well Spotify’s algorithm works for music discovery, hopefully it works that well for podcasts, too.</p>
