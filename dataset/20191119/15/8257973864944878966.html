      <p>"Wrecked. Devastated. In shock. That's how we're feeling right now after the soul we thought were going to welcome into our family in April... has taken a short cut to whatever lies beyond this life," Van Der Beek wrote.</p>
      <p>"We've been through this before, but never this late in the pregnancy, and never accompanied by such a scary, horrific threat to @vanderkimberly and her well-being. Grateful that she's now recovering, but we've only just begun unpacking the layers of this one," he said.</p>

Van Der Beek thanked the couple's friends and co-workers for their support in his post.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to all our friends and co-workers (and dance partners) who have shown up for us so beautifully during this time," he said. "As many of you have said, 'There are no words...' and it's true. Which is why in a time like this it's enough to know that you're there. Grieving AND counting our blessings today."</p>

      <p>"You never know why these things happen, that's what I've been telling my kids. All you know is that it brings you closer together, it breaks you open, it opens up your heart, it deepens your appreciation," he added. "It makes you more human."</p>
