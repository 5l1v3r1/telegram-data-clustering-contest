      <p>Filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia, who is coming up with the web show “Out Of Love”, which deals with infidelity, shared his views on the subject, saying it’s natural.</p>
      <p>“I think infidelity happens, it’s very natural. Some people are great at curbing this feeling of getting into a relationship outside of marriage, but some people are weak and make this mistake. This is what ‘Out of Love’ is all about. It is one of the most captivating scripts I have read so far, let alone directed,” Tigmanshu said.</p>

      <p>The show features Rasika Dugal, Purab Kohli, Soni Razdan and Harsh Chhaya in pivotal roles.</p>
      <p>Talking more about the project, Tigmanshu said: “It revolves around love, lies and infidelity and Rasika, Purab and the entire cast has pulled off such a fabulous job. Each character in the show has different layers, that we had to strategically bring out, to align with the temperament of our viewers. The future is web, and I am delighted to see India creating, adapting and producing such compelling content.”</p>
      <p>“Out of Love” will stream on Hotstar VIP from November 22.</p>
