      <p>Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Felipe Vázquez was hit with 21 additional charges in his child sex case on Tuesday (November 19). The 28-year-old appeared in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania courtroom to ask the judge to be released on bond, which is when prosecutors brought forward the additional counts against him. </p>
      <p>Vázquez was charged with 10 counts of child pornography, 10 counts of unlawful contact with a minor and 1 count of corruption of minors. Each of the 3rd-degree felony charges carries a 7-year maximum sentence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/257830/mlb-pitcher-felipe-vazquez-arrested-for-solicitation-of-a-child">Vázquez was arrested</a> back in September for allegedly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl after her mother discovered texts from Vázquez telling the girl that he was planning to have sex with her again. He also sent graphic videos and photos of himself, which helped investigators identify Vázquez, who has numerous "unique and distinguishable" tattoos on his body.</p>
      <p>He admitted to having "sex but not really" with the underaged victim to investigators and was hit with felony charges of statutory sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of minors. He is also facing two additional felony charges in Florida, where the victim's mother reported the relationship to police. </p>
