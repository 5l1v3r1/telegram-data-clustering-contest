      <h1>CM likely to inaugurate highway widening work</h1>

      <p>Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is expected to inaugurate upgrade of the 45 km-long Tirunelveli – Tenkasi highway into four-lane while inaugurating the new district on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 45.60-km-long two-lane stretch, between Pettai on Tirunelveli outskirts and Azad Nagar on Tenkasi outskirts, forms part of the Tirunelveli – Shencottai – Kollam highway, which is being used by a few thousand light and heavy vehicles everyday as it connects Tirunelveli district with Kerala. Following increase in traffic, it was planned to widen it into a four-lane highway on an outlay of ₹412 crore.</p>
      <p>After the Tamil Nadu Road Infrastructure Development Corporation, the project proponent, identified the successful bidder for executing the project, complaints of nepotism in award of the contract delayed the process of identifying the lowest bidder. The original plan was to start the work in July 2018 and complete it by September 2020 but the project is yet to see light of the day.</p>
      <p>Now, this badly damaged stretch causes accidents everyday especially after dusk. Officials say that the road could be neither re-laid nor repaired in a big way as it was going to be widened. So, this road, having dangerous curves and narrow bridges and culverts, causes accidents everyday.</p>
      <p>Once the four-lane highway project is completed, dangerous curves, narrow bridges and culverts would be removed. Seven overbridges including a rail overbridge at Pavoorchathiram and 71 culverts are to be built under the project.</p>
      <p>Land acquisition for the widening work has almost been completed. Over 1,400 trees were axed instead of uprooting them during rainy season and replanting them some distance away.</p>
      <p>“Once the widening work begins, we’ll plant 10 saplings for every uprooted tree and maintain the saplings for a few years. The Department of Forest, based on the soil texture, will choose fast-growing tree species and plant them,” said a Tamil Nadu Road Infrastructure Development Corporation official.</p>
      <p>So, it is expected that the Chief Minister while formally inaugurating the new Tenkasi district and laying foundation stone for the new Collectorate complex, District Police Office, will also inaugurate the work on this road.</p>
