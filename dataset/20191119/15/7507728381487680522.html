      <p><b>Olivia Colman</b> is no stranger to playing queens (she won an Oscar for playing one in <i>The Favourite</i>), and with <i>The Crown</i>, Colman takes on the world's most famous queen yet, <b>Queen Elizabeth II</b>.</p>

      <p>"The first time I saw Olivia in her wig it was magical, it was like, â€˜Oh my god, the queen is in the room,'" <b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/helena_bonham_carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a></b>, <b>Princess Margaret</b> on the series, says in the video below.</p>
      <p>For her role as Queen Elizabeth II, Colman wore hand-made outfits. Below, see her transform into Queen Elizabeth via the hair and makeup process.</p>
