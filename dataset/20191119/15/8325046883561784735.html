        <li>“I leave it in my freezer and it lasts until, like, March,” she said. “I just slowly chip away at this thing. It’s so good. I don’t know why. I’m not even a big sweets person, but it’s so good.”</li>
        <li>Cruise’s previous costars, including <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/henry-cavill">Henry Cavill</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/kirsten-dunst">Kirsten Dunst</a>, have also spoken about receiving cakes from the star.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/cobie-smulders">Cobie Smulders</a> says she’s on <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/tom-cruise">Tom Cruise’s</a> infamous holiday cake list, and she looks forward to receiving the gift every time.</p>
      <p>“The most glorious time of the year,” Smulders said during an appearance on NBC’s <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/jimmy-fallon">“Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon”</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>The “Stumptown” actress and late night host went on to gush about the white chocolate coconut cake, which they both get from Cruise.</p>
      <p>“I receive it, and hopefully, maybe if I talk about it on television I will for sure receive it,” Smulders said.</p>
      <p>The “Spider-Man: Far From Home” star went on to say that she found a clever way to make the cake last beyond the holidays.</p>
      <p>“I leave it in my freezer and it lasts until, like, March,” she said. “I just slowly chip away at this thing. It’s so good. I don’t know why. I’m not even a big sweets person, but it’s so good.”</p>
      <p>Smulders, who starred alongside Cruise in 2016’s “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,” added: “It’s Tom Cruise deliciousness.”</p>
      <p>Back in 2018, Smulders appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CtrahIy7ds">“The Goods”</a> and said that the actor sends out “hundreds, potentially thousands of cakes.” She also said that she received the cake two years in a row.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Cruise’s costars have spoken about receiving cakes from the action star.</p>
      <p>Cruise appeared on CBS’ “The Late Late Show With James Corden” and said that when he trains for movies and can’t eat sugar, he <a href="https://www.insider.com/tom-cruise-sends-co-stars-cakes-no-sugar-when-training-video-2018-7">sends cakes to his costars so he can live vicariously through them</a>. Even Bassett, his “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” costar, said that Cruise gave her one of the sweets. And fellow cast member Henry Cavill told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQvKGtLvtN0">“Access”</a> that he also was delighted to eat the “decadent” cake.</p>
      <p>Corden also said that the “Top Gun” star unexpectedly sent him a cake on the morning of the 2018 Grammys, wishing him good luck ahead of hosting the award show.</p>
      <p>Kirsten Dunst, who starred alongside Cruise in “Interview With a Vampire” spoke about the “Cruise cake” during an appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a33xxtCM6U8">“The Graham Norton Show”</a> in 2016. The actress said that it’s the “best coconut cake I’ve ever had in my life” and the dessert, which she receives every year, is from Doan’s Bakery in California.</p>
