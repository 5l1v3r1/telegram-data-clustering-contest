      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Disney says its new Disney Plus streaming service doesn't have a security breach, but some users have been shut out after hackers tried to break into their accounts.</p>
      <p>The news site ZDNet found stolen account usernames and passwords selling for $3 on underground hacking forums. Disney's streaming service costs $7 a month or $70 a year.</p>
      <p>Disney says there's no indication of a security breach on Disney Plus. It says it takes the privacy and security of users' data seriously.</p>
      <p>It's likely hackers found email and password combinations re-used by Disney Plus subscribers after they'd previously been stolen from other online services.</p>
      <p>Disney Plus hasn't said how many subscribers have had security problems. The new service attracted 10 million subscribers the day it launched earlier this month.</p>
