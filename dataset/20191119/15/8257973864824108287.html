      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Lin-Manuel-Miranda/?tps=1">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> says he was "terrified" while posing for his portrait for the National Portrait Gallery in the Smithsonian.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old actor, playwright and composer discussed the photograph and former first lady <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Michelle_Obama/?tps=1">Michelle Obama</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1196786527365414913">during Tuesday's episode</a> of <i>Today</i>.</p>
      <p>Obama presented Miranda, the creator of the musical <i>Hamilton</i>, with the Portrait of a Nation Prize at a gala Sunday in Washington, D.C. The honor recognizes Miranda's impact on America's history and culture.</p>
      <p>Miranda posed for photographer Mark Seliger ahead of the event. Miranda's portrait is a dynamic image that shows the actor posing in his <i>Hamilton</i> costume.</p>
      <p>"You can't tell, but I am standing on photographer Mark Seliger's roof. It's a four-story drop behind me, and I'm scared out of my mind in this picture," Miranda said. "Every time they catch the breeze, Mark is very happy, but I'm even more scared I will fall.</p>
      <p>"There's a metaphor in there for how history remembers us. Looking very cool but actually very terrified," he added.</p>
      <p>Miranda said it was an honor to receive the prize from Obama. He performed a song from <i>Hamilton</i> for Obama and her husband, then-president <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Barack_Obama/?tps=1">Barack Obama</a>, at the White House in 2009, years prior to the musical's Broadway debut.</p>
      <p>"I performed the first song from this, when it was really just one song, in 2009. The full circle-ness of being able to then perform for her when we were off Broadway and bring the show to the White House was a dream come true, so I'm really grateful for her," Miranda said.</p>
      <p>Miranda had shared a candid <a href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1196440635395452928">photo</a> of himself and Obama at the gala Monday on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"About last night..." he captioned the post.</p>
