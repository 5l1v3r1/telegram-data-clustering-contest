      <h1>Rob Gronkowski’s ‘Big Announcement’ Seemingly Closes Door On 2019 Return To Patriots (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:49:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend, Rob Gronkowski, who retired from the NFL in March, took to Instagram and stated that he would be dropping a big announcement on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have a big announcement to make. I can’t wait to drop it on all of you. It’s gonna be fun, it’s gonna be wild, it’s gonna be a good time,” Gronkowski said. “Come check out my Instagram page this Tuesday at 9:00am to hear the news. Lets go.”</blockquote>
      <p>Most people thought it would be football related or even wrestling related. It was neither.</p>
      <p>Gronk revealed plans for a music festival called “Gronk Beach” that will be held Saturday, Feb. 1 on Miami Beach.</p>

      <p>The last day for Gronkowski and the Patriots to agree to grant him an official return to the roster would be Saturday, Nov. 30th, and it does not look like he has any plans of doing that.</p>
      <p>If he is truly done with football, he finishes his career with 521 receptions for 7,861 yards and 79 touchdowns across 115 games.</p>
