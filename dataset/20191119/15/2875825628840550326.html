      <h2>The star detailed a particular incident that broke her heart, which led her to seek out cosmetic surgery at a young age</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:03:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/megan-barton-hanson">Megan Barton-Hanson</a> has opened up about being bullied at school over her appearance, and how it led her to seek out plastic surgery.</p>
      <p>The Love Island beauty, 25, sat down for a chat with Spice Girl Mel B about love, life, and romance, and revealed a particular incident that "literally destroyed" her.</p>
      <p>"At school I was bullied for my appearance and the way I looked," she told Mel.</p>
      <p>She added: "I was in assembly and I was sitting next to my best friend, and she was beautiful, and a boy turned around and was like, 'Look at Megan, and then look at, say her name was Olivia, look at Olivia, there's no comparison, Olivia is so much hotter.'</p>

      <p>"It literally destroyed me. I was in secondary school, must've been 13/14/15, but my heart, I was like, 'Oh my God, what do I do?'</p>
      <p>"So as soon as I started earning money, and that's what drove me to stripping to be honest, because I didn't have much money.</p>
      <p>"I had a boob job at 19, and then I started stripping. I was like, 'Right, once I get all this money...I come from a poor family, I can fix myself, I can be this beautiful person.'</p>

      <p>"And I thought that would then make me a confident person, but it wasn't at all. I fixed the outside shell but inside I was still this insecure, ugly, bullied, shy girl."</p>
      <p>Megan defies anyone to say she had the surgery too early: "I don't regret doing it but I wish someone was like, at a young age, 'Meg, you can change the outside shell and you can be however you want to look in the mirror, if you want this size boobs, if you want a smaller nose, a thinner nose, if you want bigger lips, it's not going to make you happy inside.'"</p>
      <p>She offered a word of advice for anyone seeking out surgery - and stressed the importance of therapy.</p>

      <p>"It was years and years of therapy," she revealed, "I'm not promoting cosmetic surgery - I'm saying do it, but only for you.</p>
      <p>"Definitely do therapy alongside it, or before. Changing your outside shell, doesn't mean you jump out of bed each morning and be happy because you've got bigger t***."</p>
      <p>She's recently rekindled her romance with former flame and lyrical genius Chelcee Grimes - one month after they split.</p>
      <p>Megan's had a tough time with some previous relationships.</p>
      <p>She faced messy breakups with Celebs Go Dating hookup Demi Sims and with Love Island beau <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-wes-nelson-everything-you-12611484">Wes Nelson</a> .</p>
      <p>Megan and Mel were speaking on podcast The Truth Flirts.</p>
