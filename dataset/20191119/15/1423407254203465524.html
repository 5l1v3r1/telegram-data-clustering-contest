      <h3>General changes, improvements, and fixes for PC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We fixed a recent issue that could result in Settings crashing when docking/undocking your device. This issue may have also impacted Action Center launch performance.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue impacting the performance of the Printers &amp; Scanners section of Settings loading.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue resulting in the Other People section under Storage Settings not displaying the correct size used.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue that could result in Windows Update history in Settings saying a Cumulative Update required a reboot, despite it already being installed. This occurred when a Feature on Demand had installed while the cumulative update was originally pending reboot.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue that could result in the Photos app crashing when interacting with HEVC images.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Knowns issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>BattlEye and Microsoft have found incompatibility issues due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. To safeguard Insiders who might have these versions installed on their PC, we have applied a compatibility hold on these devices from being offered affected builds of Windows Insider Preview. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/updating-to-some-windows-insider-preview-builds-on-devices-with-certai">See this article for details</a>.</li>
        <li>We’re looking into reports of the update process hanging for extended periods of time when attempting to install a new build.</li>
        <li>We’ve heard that Settings still isn’t available outside of launching via the URI (ms-settings:) for some Insiders and are investigating.</li>
        <li>Some Insiders are reporting that after successfully installing printer drivers from the Optional Updates section, the same driver is still showing as available for install. We’re looking into the issue.</li>
        <li>We’re looking into reports of certain external USB 3.0 drives not responding with Start Code 10 or 38 after they’re attached.</li>
      </ul>
