      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Teams now has 20 million daily active users.</li>
        <li>Microsoft Teams surpassed 13 million daily active users earlier this year.</li>
        <li>Microsoft announced the figure in a post about running successful teams.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Microsoft Teams hit another usage milestone. The collaboration software now has 20 million daily active users according to Microsoft (<a href="https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-teams-now-has-20-million-daily-active-users">via OnMSFT</a>). Microsoft announced the figure in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU71918YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fmicrosoft-365%252Fblog%252F2019%252F11%252F19%252F5-attributes-successful-teams%252F%253Firgwc%253D1%2526OCID%253DAID2000142_aff_7794_1246483%2526tduid%253D%252528ir__bm6f9o2iwokfrj03xkpoxiopbn2xgvso0wqwm6jz00&amp;token=aAuFsSMf">new post</a> that shares advice on how to run a successful team. Microsoft Teams continues to show growth and OnMSFT points out that it is Microsoft's fastest growing new Office 365 app.</p>
      <p>Back in July, an SEC filing revealed that <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-hits-13-million-daily-potentially-more-slack">Microsoft Teams hit 13 million daily active users</a>. That filing included figures through January 31, 2019. The latest post states that "today Teams has more than 20 million daily active users," meaning that in less than 10 months Microsoft Teams grew by over 50 percent in terms of daily active users. The same SEC filing also states that Microsoft Teams had 19 million weekly active users in January, meaning that the service now has more daily active users than it had weekly active users near the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Teams continues to gain features and will also expand to new platforms. Microsoft Teams is <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/its-official-microsoft-teams-coming-linux">on its way to Linux</a> and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-gains-new-file-and-sharing-experience-throughout-microsoft-365">gained a new file sharing experience</a> recently.</p>
      <p>For comparison Microsoft's biggest competitor - Slack - <a href="https://slackhq.com/work-is-fueled-by-true-engagement">claimed in October 12 million monthly active users</a>.</p>

        <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/sades-one-handed-keyboard-review"><b>Tiny keyboard</b> Review: SADESâ€™s affordable one-handed keyboard is a great starter model I've always been curious as to why one-handed gaming keyboards exist. After all, it's another thing to have on your desk if you do a lot of PC gaming and it's not as if you can dispense with your regular keyboard and its full suite of keys. But I'd also never tried one for myself, so I grabbed this SADES one-handed keyboard to take one for a spin</a>
