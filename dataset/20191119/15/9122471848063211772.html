      <p>“We would like to thank all of the Alabama family and everyone across the world for the prayers and outpouring of love and support for our son and our family,” the statement reads. “We felt the unceasing prayer, and words can’t express how overwhelming and uplifting that has been for us. We have total faith in God’s plan for Tua, and we know his plan is never wrong.”</p>
