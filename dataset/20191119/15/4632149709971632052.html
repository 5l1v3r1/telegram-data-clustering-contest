      <p>Cubbon Park and Lalbagh’s history will soon be available on your mobile phone screens. The horticulture department is in the process of developing an app that documents the history of each statue, lake and structure in both the lung spaces. Similar to QR scanners, the app will use Augmented Reality (AR) scanners to display the historical background of the structures and the statues. Display boards in Lalbagh have already been installed and in two-three weeks from now, they will also be installed in Cubbon Park. <br/><br/>G Kusuma, deputy director of horticulture department said, “One has to download the app and scan the sign boards through it to get the information. We have signed a contract with a software developer, who will build the app called Flipp AR Go. We have plans to have AR codes on trees in Cubbon Park so that people can have access to information about the tree species. But, a survey of trees will be conducted before that.” <br/><br/>The boards are being installed near the lake in Cubbon Park. It is also being installed near Bandstand, High Court and other important historical structures in Cubbon Park and Lalbagh. <br/><br/><br/>Vivek Mahaveer Jain, one of the developers of the app said, “The information will be live in the visitors’ phone once the signs get scanned. It will be a surreal experience. This will help the tourists who want to know the city better. Our research team has been collecting the historical background of the structures.” <br/><br/>Another survey by the Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions is underway to count the trees and recognise species in Lalbagh. Bengaluru based nonprofit, United Way, will install QR scanners on all trees in Lalbagh so that one can scan the QR code through an app and get details of the tree species and how old it is. M Jagadeesh, joint director (parks and gardens), horticulture department said, “The tree survey will take another three months to complete. QR codes have also been installed on all the buildings, structures and statues in Lalbagh. The work will take another six months to complete.”</p>
