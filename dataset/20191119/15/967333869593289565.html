      <p>Tuesday saw the 6th anniversary of “World Toilet Day” and the theme this year is “'Leaving No One Behind.”</p>
      <p>“Sanitation is your human right and yet, today, 4.2 billion people live without safely managed sanitation. We must expand access to safe toilets,” the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/toiletday/">UN wrote in a blog post,</a> explaining the theme.</p>
      <p>According to UN statistics, over 637 million people still defecate in the open.</p>
      <p>Nearly 297,000 minors succumb to fatal diseases and lose their lives because of improper sanitation and hand hygiene facilities.</p>
      <p>In fact, 1.25 billion women and girls <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/multimedia/2019/10/infographic-periods">still do not have access</a> to hygienic and private toilets.</p>

      <blockquote>​“Toilets save lives, because human waste spreads killer diseases. ‘World Toilet Day’ is about inspiring action to tackle the global sanitation crisis,” the UN’s post said.</blockquote>
      <p>The UN aims to provide sanitation for all by 2030.</p>
      <p>Netizens also marked the day on social networking platforms with a trending hashtag #WorldToiletDay which has already received over 173,000 mentions.</p>
