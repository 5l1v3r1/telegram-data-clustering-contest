      <p>MILWAUKEE - The state Department of Natural Resources is rejecting a plan from a unit of Johnson Controls International that calls for the agency rather than the company to determine the extent of pollution from firefighting foam around Marinette.</p>
      <p>Tyco Fire Products, a unit of Johnson Controls, has been testing firefighting foam in the area for decades.</p>
      <p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that Tyco has proposed that the DNR assess the extent of contamination because the department is better positioned to obtain permission from landowners and government agencies to access land for testing.</p>
      <p>Darsi Foss is the DNR's environmental management division administrator. The Journal Sentinel reports she has rejected any efforts to put the onus on the department, citing many examples where a company responsible for pollution has handled assessments.</p>
