      <p>It's an exciting time to be a <i>Star Wars</i> fan, as we're just one month away from the release of <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>. J.J. Abrams' <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484975/looks-like-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-is-still-giving-colin-trevorrow-some-credit">second installment</a> in the galaxy far far away will wrap up the current trilogy, as well as the overarching Skywalker Saga. The pressure is on to deliver, and give a proper ending to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485028/the-rise-of-skywalkers-jj-abrams-thinks-its-incredible-leias-story-was-still-told-after-carrie-fishers-death">characters old and new</a>. Chief among them is Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, who will likely continue moving up the ranks of The Resistance. And now Isaac has teased the dynamic we'll see between the trio of new heroes.</p>
      <p>J.J. Abrams introduced a slew of new characters in <i>The Force Awakens</i>, including heroes Rey, Finn, and Poe. But the last two movies in the franchise have largely kept these characters separated, and on their own adventures. That'll change with <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> will feature a one-year time jump, which will help unite those heroes as a unit. Oscar Isaac <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484858/daisy-ridley-needs-only-3-words-to-describe-the-rise-of-skywalker">spoke to this exciting change</a>, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>This time around you get to see the trio together, you know, I think after the spirit of the original trilogy, exploring the dynamic between these three characters that love each other. You feel like they have been together but when you really look at it, wow, they really haven’t spent much time together.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, this is definitely exciting. The original trilogy put Leia, Han, and Luke through countless adventures, but they were usually united as one unit. That hasn't been the way the current trilogy has operated, with the new heroes being fleshed out on adventures separate from each other.</p>
      <p>Oscar Isaac's comments to <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/18/poe-dameron-millennium-falcon-rise-of-skywalker/">EW</a> are sure to make <i>Star Wars</i> fans happy. The upcoming sequel will bring the trio of heroes together as a unit. A year of fighting the First Order presumably brought them together. Not only are they teammates in the ongoing battle <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484951/sounds-like-daisy-ridley-loved-playing-dark-rey-in-the-rise-of-skywalker">against the Dark Side</a>, but their interpersonal relationships should have developed quite a bit during this time as well.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485098/new-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-image-has-poe-dameron-piloting-the-millennium-falcon">Related: New Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker Image Has Poe Dameron Piloting The Millennium Falcon</a>
      </p>
      <p>Just how separate the heroes have been throughout the current trilogy is most obvious when it comes to the relationship between Poe and Rey. Or lack thereof, as they met for the very first time in during the final moments of <i>The Last Jedi</i>. Finn has a clear connection with both of those rebels, and might end up being the connective tissue between the group.</p>
      <p><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> will also be intimately involved with the previous eight movies. The majority of the Skywalker Saga is currently available to stream on Disney+. And you can <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/410947/705874/9358">use this link for a free 7-day trial</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequel trilogy's heroes will be joined by some droid companions during their upcoming adventures in <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>. That includes BB-8 <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479208/anthony-daniels-teases-c-3pos-red-eyes-as-a-magnificent-piece-of-storytelling">and Anthony Daniels' C-3PO</a>, who will have a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483502/watch-c-3po-actor-anthony-daniels-encourage-fans-to-rewatch-star-wars-before-the-rise-of-skywalker">significantly larger role</a> in <i>Episode IX</i>. The gang's all here, and it should be fascinating to see exactly how it all goes down. Luckily, our answers will arrive in a month.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> will hit theaters on December 20th.
