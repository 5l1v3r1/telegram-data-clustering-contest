      <p>It's almost time to say goodbye to your usual wardrobe and hello to something a little more festive, and yes I'm talking about jumpers. Did you know that Dec. 13 is Christmas Jumper Day? I didn't either. But if you're lucky enough to be spending that with a four-legged friend, it's time to head on down to the shops because <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/missguided-have-launched-matching-roll-necks-for-you-your-pup-19312193">Sainsbury's have a range of Christmas jumpers for dogs</a> at such an affordable price.</p>
      <p>You can thank Sainbury's Tu Clothing for bringing this festive cheer to the aisles, and you can even coordinate their outfit with the whole family. There are four different styles to dress your pooch in, including two jumpers and two coats. The coats cost £12, while the jumpers are a little more expensive at £14.</p>
      <p>When it comes to sizing, Tu stocks a small, medium, and large which coincides with the side of your breed. The models for their shoot were a Pug (S), a Border Terrier Poodle (M), and a Golden Retriever (L). Those three sizes can wear each style, but for the <a href="https://tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk/p/Christmas-Navy-Santa-Print-Dog-Jumper/136008520-Blue?searchTerm=:newArrivals&amp;searchProduct=">Christmas Navy Santa Print Dog Jumper</a> the <a href="https://tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk/p/Christmas-Green-Elf-Dog-Jumper/136008394-Green?searchTerm=:newArrivals&amp;searchProduct=">Green Elf Dog Jumper</a>, and the <a href="https://tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk/p/Christmas-Family-Dressing-Red-Santa-Dog-Jumper/136005759-Red?searchTerm=:newArrivals&amp;searchProduct=">Family Dressing Red Santa Jumper</a> they are also available in size XL.</p>

      <p>The human counterparts to these outfits are pretty similar in price, ranging from £12 to £24 for kids and adults. Obviously, the clothes for the pups match perfectly to the ones for the rest of the family, but some of the outfits also <a href="https://tuclothing.sainsburys.co.uk/c/christmas/christmas-family-nightwear?INITD=GNav-Christmas-FamilyNightwear">stylishly match Tu's Christmas pyjamas.</a></p>
