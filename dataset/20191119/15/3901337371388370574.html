      <p>It’s been eight months since his horror injury in the Absa Premiership, but Kaizer Chiefs’ Nkosingiphile Ngcobo is now very much on the verge of his anticipated comeback. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The midfielder, who celebrated his 20th birthday last week, has been being eased back into things by way of the Amakhosi’s Multichoice Diski Challenge side, with Arthur Zwane being instructed to use him increasingly as he gets back to full fitness. </p>
      <p>Ngcobo injured his Achilles back in March which playing against SuperSport United, an injury that meant he required surgery, and he has spent the bulk of the last year working on getting back to full fitness once again.</p>
      <p>Now, with Chiefs flying high in the league and into the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout, the midfield man got his first full 90 minutes of action over the weekend as he played the full game against Orlando Pirates, although he wasn’t able to help them secure victory. </p>
      <p>The team, who were coached by Shaun Bartlett as Zwane is away on international duty with Bafana Bafana, were beaten 1-0 by the Buccaneers in their latest MDC meeting, with another first team player, Njabulo Blom, also featuring as he donned the captain’s armband. </p>

      </p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how long Ngcobo will wait to get back into Ernst Middendorp’s matchday squad following his lengthy absence, but the German is known to be a fan of the youngsters and will no doubt be pleased to have him back in contention once again. </p>
