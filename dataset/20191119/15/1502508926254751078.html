      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>on Tuesday announced a new Cloud Acceleration Programme for enterprises who run their businesses on SAP and are increasingly looking to the cloud to support their mission-critical workloads.</p>
      <p>Customers who participate in the Cloud Acceleration Programme will gain new architecture templates, accelerators and SAP-focused support, in addition to partner-led assessment services, prototyping, and centers of excellence dedicated to SAP on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>Cloud Platform (GCP), the tech giant said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Finally, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>launched a programme called Lighthouse, in partnership with system integrators, to streamline the customers' SAP journeys to the cloud.</p>
      <p>The Cloud Acceleration Programme is an evolution of Lighthouse.</p>
      <p>"It empowers our customers with solutions from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/google-cloud">Google Cloud </a>and our partners to simplify their cloud migrations-whether it's shifting SAP workloads from on-premises to Google Cloud, or extending SAP solutions with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/google-cloud">Google Cloud </a>or other leading third-party technologies," said the company.</p>
      <p>The Cloud Acceleration Programme includes support from global services partners such as Accenture, Atos, Deloitte and HCL, which have created Google Cloud-specific business units to help customers migrate key workloads and applications to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/google-cloud">Google Cloud.</a></p>
