      <p>With a host of Christmas movies already hitting TV channels and streaming services, it's time to start stocking up on the popcorn for those nights in front of the telly.</p>
      <p>Snack specialist Metcalfe's has launched a new version of the treat called Jumbles that promises to be a new festive flavour experience.</p>
      <p>Available in two fabulous flavour combos, Toffee Apple and Eton Mess, Metcalfe’s Popcorn Jumbles brings together an assortment of tastes and textures.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Reminiscent of the much-loved traditional treat, toffee apple lovers can now munch on delicious toffee and caramel-coated popcorn jumbled up with slices of dried apple, without a thought about calories.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, snack aficionados can enjoy the Eton Mess flavour, bursting with delectable strawberry pieces and crunchy meringue shells and mingled with strawberry-coated popcorn replicating the British summer favourite dessert - but lighter.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Made with the very best butterfly popcorn, this new sharable snack is a lusciously light substitute to those calorific chocolate share bags, making them perfect for movie nights and Christmas gatherings.</p>
      <p>The snack is available now at Sainsbury’s for £1.79.</p>
