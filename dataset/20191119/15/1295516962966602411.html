      <h1>Bob's Burgers Movie Removed, Then Readded to Disney Slate</h1>

      <p>Fans of the animated FOX series, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/bobs-burgers/">Bob's Burgers</a><i>,</i> might be suffering a bit of informational whiplash today regarding the release date of the feature film. Although <a href="https://www.cbr.com/bobs-burgers-movie-simpsons-sequel-announced/">talk of a movie version of <i>Bob's Burgers</i></a> has been around for a while now, Disney recently left it off the schedule of upcoming releases, causing quite the uproar, but has since released an update with the movie still scheduled for a 2020 release.</p>
      <p>The confusion over whether or not there will be a movie is probably a direct result of the Disney/FOX merger, but fans are justifiably confused. Fans took to Twitter to get some answers and got reassurance from <i>Bob's Burgers</i> creator, Loren Bouchard.</p>

      <p>Few details have been released about the movie aside from its July 17, 2020 premiere date. Loren Bouchard will remain as showrunner, and the original cast will reprise their roles for the animated film, but not much else has been revealed about the plot or where it falls in the TV show timeline. Bouchard told <a href="https://www.looper.com/89195/bobs-burgers-movie-coming-2020/"><i>Looper</i></a> in 2017, "We know the movie has to scratch every itch the fans of the show have ever had, but it also has to work for all the good people who've never seen the show."</p>
      <p><i>Bob's Burgers</i> has aired on FOX since 2011 and is currently in its tenth season. It airs Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
