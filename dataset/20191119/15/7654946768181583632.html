      <h1>Netflix stock holds steady in wake of Disney+ launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:53:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Wall Street’s reaction so far to Walt Disney Company’s long-awaited streaming service suggests investors believe the competition may not be as crushing as expected for entertainment rival Netflix.</p>
      <p>Shares of Disney have surged 8 percent since the launch of Disney+ a week ago, helped along by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/disney-nets-10m-subscribers-beating-expectations/">10 million sign-ups for the service in its first day</a>. But during the same period, Netflix’s stock recovered from an initial slump and is now up nearly 3 percent, with some investors betting the two companies’ streaming offerings may be able to coexist.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Disney rose 2.1 percent to $147.65, just shy of its record high close on Nov. 13, while Netflix climbed 2.6 percent to its highest close since August.</p>
      <p>“I’m a consumer of both services and I can tell you that what my kids watch on Netflix is not what they watch on Disney+. Now I get it, and the market is reacting to that, appreciating the shares of both companies,” said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Baker Avenue owns shares of Disney and recently began buying Netflix shares.</p>
      <p>Investors for months have viewed the looming launch of Disney+ as the most dangerous challenge yet to Netflix’s dominance of an increasingly crowded video streaming market. Disney’s stock has risen 27 percent since April when Disney+ was unveiled, while Netflix remains down 18 percent.</p>
