      <p>The Indian Coast Guard has saved lives of six fishermen approximately 70 nautical miles off Kanniyakumari.</p>
      <p>A press release said ship Aadesh, on patrol in Gulf of Mannar, was diverted to assist stranded fishing boat ‘El-Shadai’ with six crew. The boat was stranded in the sea since Sunday following a defect in its engine.</p>
      <p>Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre, Thoothukudi, received a distress call on Sunday. ICG’s ship was diverted to proceed towards the area. It reached the area at about 8 a.m. on Monday and began search for the boat.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a Coast Guard Dornier aircraft was pressed into service to carry out a sea-air coordinated search for the boat. The aircraft sighted the boat at about 1.45 p.m. and guided the ship towards the boat. The crew attempted to rectify the defect. The ship too provided logistics support but the engine failed to start. So, the ship began towing the boat to Colachel at about 4.30 p.m. and reached Thengapattanam fishing harbour at 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard officials in Thoothukudi were in constant communication with the boat owner and fisheries authorities.</p>
      <p>“The incident highlights disadvantages of fishing boats venturing out alone. The fishermen are advised to undertake fishing in groups adhering to safe practices at sea and carry adequate lifesaving appliances and communication equipment onboard,” the statement said.</p>
