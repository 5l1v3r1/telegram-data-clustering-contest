      <p>Torbay Council has restarted talks with the owner of the run-down Crossways shopping centre in Paignton in an effort to speed up regeneration plans.</p>
      <p>The council is trying to reach a deal to buy the centre so it can get on with proposals to redevelop the site.</p>
      <p>It has now requested an independent valuation of the property to form the basis of negotiations with the owner.</p>
      <p>Agreeing a deal on the price would be quicker than opting for compulsory purchase, a legal process which could take up to 18 months.</p>
      <p>In September councillors gave senior officers powers to start the compulsory purchase if necessary.</p>
      <p>A meeting of Torbay Council heard that it would provide a back-up if negotiations with the owner failed.</p>
      <p>Plans have been put forward to redevelop the near-empty concrete complex with an estimated Â£22.5m scheme.</p>
      <p>It would include shops on the ground floor and "extra-care" affordable housing on the upper levels.</p>
      <p>The shopping centre has a walkway which links Torquay Road and Hyde Road, but most of the shops are now empty and it has been described as an eyesore.</p>

      <p>The site has been zoned for redevelopment in local planning policies in recent years but the owner Gaelic Investments has so far held on to it.</p>
      <p>Councillors were told at a meeting it September that the owner said early this year it had its own redevelopment plans.</p>
      <p>But because there was no sign of progress, such as a planning application, the council was now intending to get on with the job.</p>
      <p>A report said officers would restart talks with the owner to buy the land while preparing the compulsory purchase order as a back-up.</p>
      <p>A planning application for the site would also be brought forward, councillors heard.</p>
