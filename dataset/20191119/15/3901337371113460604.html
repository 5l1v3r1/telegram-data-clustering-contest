      <p>Furman has been a midfield workhorse for Kaitano Tambo’s team. Something SL Supporter @tebohowaleSundowns recognizes, and feels the 31-year-old is the type of player needed at the defending PSL champions.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Typical midfielder who is always passionate about his game. I admire him a lot. His style of play is suitable for Mamelodi Sundowns anyway, I won't be surprised if I see their interest in his services.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He is not the only admirer of Furman, SL Supporter @kc-inferno has seen the possibility of Furman possibly replacing the ageing Katsande in the Chiefs midfield.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Bobsteak must wake up, after missing out on Cole Alexander this is a great chance to send Katsande to the stands by signing this guy.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Not one for the limelight, SL Supporter @ Taayah-shimooshili0 has hailed Furman as one of the hardest working midfielders in the country.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“SA’s most underrated footballer by far.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Which team do you think would best suit Furman should he decide to leave SuperSport?</b>
