        <b>Super-sub jockey Racheal Kneller was on to a winner after a last-minute plea on Twitter to ride a favourite.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Owner Vaughan Lewis had been left without a rider for his horse Ruacana at Lingfield after Trevor Whelan's flight from Ireland was cancelled.</p>
      <p>Kneller was alerted to his post, the pair were put in touch and she steered the 13-8 shot, trained by Zoe Davison, to victory.</p>
      <p>"It's great that Twitter has helped," the 32-year-old rider told BBC Sport.</p>
      <p>The Flat Jockeys Can Jump Handicap Hurdle was flat jockey Kneller's debut race over obstacles and first win from 36 rides this year.</p>
      <p>Lewis nearly withdrew his horse before making the plea on social media as a last resort.</p>
      <p>"Help please Racing Twitter - Urgently need flat jockey to ride favourite in 1pm at Lingfield," he wrote at just after 08:30 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>With the help of her agent Anna Wallace, Kneller was recruited an hour later and said she could even afford to enjoy a McDonald's milkshake on the way to the course as the weights for riders in jump racing are higher than on the flat.</p>
      <p>"I had a chocolate milkshake on the way there and I'll be having Champagne when I get home," she said.</p>
      <p>Kneller had ridden out two lots of horses on Tuesday morning and was oblivious to the plea from Lewis until she checked her phone.</p>
      <p>"It's funny how it all happened. I had been keen to ride in the race and Zoe's daughter Gemelle contacted my agent Anna and quite a few people tagged me when they advertised looking for a jockey," she added.</p>
      <p>"I've been chasing a winner for a long time and the horse jumped everything perfectly. He was pulling me round; I was just a passenger."</p>
      <p>Despite an hour-and-a-half drive from Lambourn, Berkshire, to the Surrey track, Kneller still had time to squeeze in some research.</p>
      <p>She watched video replays of Ruacana's previous runs on her phone while walking the track, and rang former jump jockey-turned trainer Jamie Osborne for advice.</p>
      <p>"He said keep one leg either side. But then he gave me some really good advice and it all helped," she said.</p>
