      <p>A <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=White+House">White House</a> official testified in the impeachment inquiry against US president <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a> on Tuesday that the president’s phone call urging Ukraine’s leader to investigate a political rival of Mr Trump’s was improper, and criticised what he called “cowardly” attacks on witnesses in the investigation.</p>
      <p>Lt Col <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Alexander+Vindman">Alexander Vindman</a>, the White House National Security Council’s top <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Ukraine">Ukraine</a> expert, testified on Tuesday at the third public hearing in the impeachment effort before the House of Representatives intelligence committee.</p>
      <p>Vindman, who along with other witnesses has been publicly criticised by Mr Trump, also told the politicians present that “vile character attacks” against public servants testifying in the impeachment inquiry were “reprehensible”, urging Americans to be “better than callow and cowardly attacks”. Mr Vindman, an <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Iraq">Iraq</a> war veteran, appeared at the hearing wearing his army uniform and medals.</p>
      <p>Mr Vindman did not specifically mention Mr Trump when he referred to “cowardly attacks”. Some Trump allies in the conservative media had questioned Mr Vindman’s loyalty to the US ahead of the hearing.</p>
      <p>“It is improper for the president of the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=United+States">United States</a> to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and political opponent,” Mr Vindman said in his opening statement during the second week of public hearings.</p>
      <p>Three other witnesses were scheduled to testify at Tuesday’s hearing: <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kurt+Volker">Kurt Volker</a>, the former US special envoy to Ukraine; <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jennifer+Williams">Jennifer Williams</a>, an aide to vice-president <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mike+Pence">Mike Pence</a>, and former <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=National+Security+Council">National Security Council</a> <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Russia">Russia</a> expert <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Tim+Morrison">Tim Morrison</a>.</p>
      <h3>July 25th call</h3>
      <p>The inquiry focuses on a July 25th phone call in which Mr Trump asked Ukrainian president <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Volodymyr+Zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> to carry out two investigations that would benefit him politically, including one targeting Democratic political rival <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Joe+Biden">Joe Biden</a>. The other involved a debunked conspiracy theory embraced by some Trump allies that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
      <p>In her prepared statement to the committee, Ms Williams said the July 25th call was “unusual” because “it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter”. Ms Williams said the White House budget office had said Mr Trump’s acting chief of staff <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mick+Mulvaney">Mick Mulvaney</a> had directed that $391 million in security aid to Ukraine be put on hold and that she never learned why the assistance was later released in September.</p>
      <p>Ms Williams, who was attacked by Mr Trump on Twitter just days before her public appearance, also told politicians that she was committed to serving the US’s interests, adding that “it was with great pride and conviction that I swore an oath to uphold and defend the constitution”.</p>
      <p>Ms Williams was among the US officials who monitored the Trump-Zelenskiy call. She previously testified behind closed doors this month that some of Mr Trump’s comments were “inappropriate”.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump assailed her on Twitter on Sunday as a “Never Trumper” who should “work out a better presidential attack”. He has used the term “Never Trumper” to describe Republicans who oppose him. Mr Trump has called them “human scum”.</p>
      <p>The investigation could lead the House to approve formal charges against Mr Trump – known as articles of impeachment – that would be sent to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial on whether to remove him from office. Few Republican senators have broken with Mr Trump on the issue.</p>
      <h3>Cooler reception</h3>
      <p>Mr Volker won praise from Republicans after he testified privately last month but can expect a cooler reception from Democrats during Tuesday’s hearing.</p>
      <p>Mr Volker told politicians in October he did not know of any effort by Mr Trump to press Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden, a leading Democratic contender to face Mr Trump in the presidential election next year, and Mr Biden’s son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm called <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Burisma">Burisma</a>.</p>
      <p>“[Former] vice-president Biden was never a topic of discussion,” Mr Volker said in his October 3rd closed-door testimony.</p>
      <p>But other witnesses have identified Mr Volker as one of the “Three Amigos”, along with energy secretary <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rick+Perry">Rick Perry</a> and US ambassador to the EU <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Gordon+Sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>, who were tasked by Mr Trump to obtain Mr Zelenskiy’s commitment to investigating the Bidens. Mr Trump’s personal lawyer <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rudy+Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> also was a central figure in trying to get Ukraine to carry out those investigations.</p>
      <p>Among those whose previous testimony was at odds with Mr Volker’s deposition was Mr Vindman.</p>
      <p>Mr Vindman and Mr Volker are at odds over some issues, for example, over what occurred at a July 10th White House meeting. Mr Volker testified that US and Ukrainian officials in the meeting did not discuss any investigations. Mr Vindman said Mr Sondland raised the need for Ukraine to open “specific investigations” if Mr Zelenskiy wanted to have a coveted meeting with Mr Trump.</p>
      <p>At a follow-up meeting that both also attended, Mr Vindman said in previous testimony: “Sondland emphasised the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of his request that Mr Zelenskiy carry out the two investigations, Mr Trump had frozen $391 million in US security aid approved by Congress to help Ukraine combat Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.</p>
      <p>Democrats have accused Mr Trump of using the frozen aid and Mr Zelenskiy’s desire for an Oval Office meeting as leverage to pressure a vulnerable US ally to dig up dirt on political adversaries.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and raged on Twitter against what he calls “a witch hunt” and a “hoax”. He said on Monday he might testify before the House intelligence committee, which is leading the impeachment inquiry. Democrats responded with scepticism. – Reuters</p>
