      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> couldn’t resist a cheeky dig at his famous dad.</p>
      <p>The radio DJ is the son of actor Martin Kemp, who is a member of the band Spandau Ballet which shot to fame in the 80s.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old revealed in the latest episode of I’m A Celebrity that Martin’s brother Gary was apparently ordered by their mum to include him in the group.</p>
      <p>He joked that the 58-year-old ‘couldn’t even sing or play an instrument’ when Spandau Ballet was formed.</p>
      <p>Roman joked: ‘He still can’t. He still hasn’t realised his mic wasn’t on for Live Aid!’</p>
      <p>The campmate also recalled his dad’s health battle, revealed he had to ‘relearn’ the New Romantic band’s hits such as Gold and True.</p>

      <p>‘When they went back on tour, post brain tumour and stuff like that, he forgot everything. So he forgot how to play and he forgot all the songs,’ he explained.</p>

      <p>‘He knew how to play but he didn’t know any of the songs. So I had to learn them and then teach him. I learnt all the Spandau songs and then retaught them to him.’</p>
      <p>Roman added that the difficult time in Martin’s life made them ‘super close’.</p>
      <p>‘How can my dad not be my hero through all of that. We’re a proper unit,’ he added.</p>

      <p>His fellow camper Kate Garraway, a Good Morning Britain presenter, confessed that she had a crush on Martin’s dad back in the day.</p>
      <p>She told him: ‘He was my absolutely favourite.’</p>
      <p>Roman went on: ‘My dad is my best mate. 100%. I speak to him every day.’</p>
      <p>Last night’s episode saw Kate and Caitlyn Jenner take on the bushtucker trial Bugged Off, which saw them trapped in a suspended box that was gradually filled with insects and rats.</p>
      <p>Kate ended up in the main camp after winning two stars while Caitlyn was sent back to Snake Rock.</p>
