      <p><b>Czarface</b> — the underground hip hop project of the Wu-Tang Clan’s <b>Inspectah Deck</b> and <b>7L &amp; Esoteric</b> — remain very prolific in the studio (among their 2019 releases are a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/chaka-khan-js-ondara-czarface-ghostface-hexvessel-bis-millencolin-reviews/">collab LP with Ghostface Killah</a> and an upcoming Record Store Day Black Friday release called <a href="https://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/11912"><i>The Odd Czar Against Us</i></a>), but they don’t seem to play live very often. So it’s exciting to learn that they’ll play NYC’s <b>Sony Hall on January 16</b>. <a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www1.ticketmaster.com/czarface/event/0000574EBEE7542D"><b>Tickets</b></a> for that show go on sale Friday (11/22) at noon with an AmEx presale starting Wednesday (11/20) at noon.</p>
      <p>It appears to be their only upcoming show at the moment, but stay tuned in case that changes. Watch a video from their collab LP with Ghostface below.</p>
      <p>Speaking of, Ghostface has <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/ghostface-killah-playing-shows-before-every-time-i-dies-tid-the-season/">upcoming shows</a> too.</p>
