      <h1>What Granit Xhaka would bring to Newcastle United</h1>
      <h2>Xhaka has been heavily linked with a move to St James' park, but what could he bring to United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:10:18+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">David Alexander Hughes</a></address>
      <p>Recent reports have linked Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka to Newcastle, with the club reportedly keen on striking a loan deal for the 27-year-old in this coming January transfer window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> has made no secret of the fact that a new central midfielder is top of his shopping list and he seems eager to profit from Xhaka’s discord with current club Arsenal. The Swiss international was highly thought of by his team-mates at the Emirates and was subsequently voted club captain ahead of this campaign.</p>
      <p>However, his future in North London is now in doubt after an outburst last month following ridicule from home fans in a match vs Crystal Palace was exacerbated by an Instagram post, in which he hit back at fans stating "Happiness is when you are satisfied with yourself and don’t need the confirmation of others."</p>
      <p>There are reportedly a number of parties interested in Xhaka, but if he were to come to St James’ Park, what would he bring to Bruce’s side?</p>
      <p>Firstly, it’s worth noting that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-arsenal-granit-xhaka-17279945">Xhaka’s</a> profile very must suits that of a deep-lying midfielder.</p>
      <p>One of his roles at Arsenal is to sit in front and protect a defence, deployed to read opposition attacks and limit the threat they pose on the counter following possession turnovers further up the pitch. </p>
      <p>Whilst this season has been hampered by off the pitch developments, last season, he was averaging a very decent 4.48 interceptions per 90 minutes. Only Sean Longstaff and Isaac Hayden bettered that average last season from Newcastle’s current crop of midfielders, and notably, both featured for a much more defence orientated side. </p>
      <p>Not only does he read the game well, but he has also proven himself to be a solid technical player when in possession. For Arsenal last season, he was an important cog in passing sequences, averaging nearly 69 passes per game with an impressive success rate of over 87%.</p>
      <p>Sometimes passing stats, particularly for midfielders, can be padded out by short five-yard passes that present little value in terms of commencing attacking sequences.</p>
      <p>However, as can been seen in the below pass map for Xhaka taken from Arsenal's defeat to Chelsea in last seasons Europe League, he will often play an array of accurate passes to different areas of the pitch.</p>

      <p>There is even an argument to be made that he was unfairly ridiculed in his last appearance for Arsenal in that infamous 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Prior to his substitution in the 67th minute, Xhaka had misplaced just five passes - at least three of which exceeded ten-yards - and he had also registered an assist. This would suggest the narrative around the midfielder and his perceived struggles may be slightly warped.</p>

      <p>This season under Bruce, Newcastle have mostly lined up in a 5-4-1 formation, with the idea of making United compact and difficult for opposing sides to play through.</p>
      <p>The two central midfielders are tasked with different roles through the centre, with one sitting in front of the back-four, regaining and recycling possession, whilst the other is given more license to roam from box-to-box. Bruce tends to favour a midfield duo that fluctuates between Isaac Hayden, Ki Sung-yueng, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jonjo-shelvey">Jonjo Shelvey</a> and Sean Longstaff, depending on fitness and suspensions.</p>
      <p>Whilst all four boast characteristics of Xhaka, none seem to merge both the defensive and technical aspects of the game as well, therefore his introduction could provide Newcastle with more prowess through the middle.</p>
      <p>Xhaka would likely prove to be the more defensive-minded of a central midfield pairing, protecting the defence and allowing a partner, perhaps Longstaff, to feature more as a box-to-box midfielder, aiding in attack when required.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old's potential deeper positioning could make him a pivotal cog when Newcastle are in possession. Although United don’t tend to overfocus on ball retention and have the lowest ball possession average in the league with 34.5%, the added quality he would bring on the ball in the middle could allow Bruce to introduce more passing sequences into his sides play, using Xhaka to connect the defence with the wide areas and attackers ahead.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, a loan option for the Swiss international may prove an ideal move for both parties. The player himself will be keen to play regularly ahead of next summers European Championship, whilst his abilities in the middle for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United</a> would prove a notable reinforcement on what they already have.</p>
