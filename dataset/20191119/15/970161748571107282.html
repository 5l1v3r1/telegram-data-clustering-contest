        <b>Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) has had something of a wake up call – not to mention a throbbing cheek – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eastenders-spoilers-kathy-beale-violently-slaps-ben-mitchell-as-he-threatens-martin-fowlers-children-11177187/">after a showdown with his disgusted mum Kathy Beale</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gillian-taylforth/">Gillian Taylforth</a>) over his recent behaviour in EastEnders. And with his relationship with Callum Highway (Tony Clay) on shaky ground, he has some decisions to make.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Ben always does when he feels he is getting too happy, he plays the hard man and pushes those close to him away – and he left Callum feeling mucked about when he dismissed his ambition to join the police force. Refusing to be pushed around, Callum walked out and Ben got steadily more drunk during a family meal.</p>
      <p>When Kathy overheard Ben ordering Martin Fowler (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) to take on a stolen cars job, or else, she was horrified at him for blackmailing a family member. Ben was disparaging and turned on Kathy, telling her that she was weak and was to blame for the abuse she had endured in her life.</p>

      <p>Kathy told Ben that she was ashamed of him and slapped him hard – and relations tonight are still pretty tense as Ben has a go at his mum. Bobby (Clay Milner Russell) overhears and is concerned so he mentions it to Callum, who is equally worried.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) tries to lift Ben’s spirits by involving him in an invite to a family weekend away and he starts to feel his spirits lift once more. It’s at this point that Callum approaches Ben with a proposition – but will the couple repair the rift that has started to form between them?</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen what Callum suggests – and how Ben reacts – but it’s clear that Ben is going to have to start prioritising what’s most important to him and make some decisions.</p>
