      <h1>Latest OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro update comes with various bug fixes and performance enhancements</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:27:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>OnePlus has made a name for itself by providing stellar software support across its lineup. Continuing this tradition, the company announced today that it's rolling out OxygenOS 10.0.2 to the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. Other than bug fixes, the update brings various performance optimizations to both phones, as well as a video stability enhancement to just the 7 Pro. Sadly, the 5G version is <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/12/oneplus-7-pro-5g-android-10-2020/">still left in the cold</a>.</p>
      <p>While the improvements and fixes are all in all minor taken individually, they still offer some gains in terms of stability, connectivity, and power consumption. OnePlus touts that OxygenOS 10.0.2 boosts standby power consumption and charging with third-party bricks. Bluetooth and network performance should also be increased. The company has also fixed a few issues with blank screens, black bars, and volume problems with AirPods. On the security front, the Android patch level has been raised to the version from October.</p>
