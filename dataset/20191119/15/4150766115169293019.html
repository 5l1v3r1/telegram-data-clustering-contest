      <h1>Blind singer Makaho goes from streets to stardom in Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:29:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Yahaya Makaho feels his way to the microphone before launching into a song for his new album at a recording studio in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna.</p>
      <p>Blind since early childhood, the singer has overcome obstacles that often crush the dreams of disabled people in this region and risen from street beggar to star.</p>
      <p>In the last four years his songs and music videos have become hits among the roughly 80 million Hausa-speaking Nigerians and broader West Africa.</p>
      <p>“I see myself as a superstar who has broken the jinx associated with physical disabilities,” Makaho, 37, said, wearing his trademark sunglasses.</p>
      <p>“I have punctured the stereotype people have that once you are blind all you can do is take a bowl and go begging for alms on the streets.”</p>
      <p>Life can be tough in northern Nigeria, where poverty rates and unemployment are high – and for blind people the options are usually severely limited.</p>
      <p>Makaho – a nickname meaning “blind man” in Hausa under which the singer is widely known – has had to come a long way to record his 370 singles and three albums.</p>
      <p>He lost his sight to measles at the age of three and was eventually sent away from his rural village to an Islamic school after doctors failed to heal him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Singer with a difference’</b>
      </p>
      <p>There he was told that begging was his best chance to make ends meet after he tried his hand at small odd-jobs and petty trading.</p>
      <p>“It hurt me to be always asking people for money. Begging kills the spirit and I decided to become a singer,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know I had singing talent, I just wanted to do something meaningful with my life and the idea of being a singer just popped up.”</p>
      <p>It has not been a smooth rise since that decision.</p>
      <p>Makaho faced years of discrimination and discouragement before a wealthy fan decided to fund a recording session in 2016.</p>
      <p>The singer has carved out a niche by focusing on the pressing problems that confront his fans in their daily lives.</p>
      <p>With his soft voice he croons his way through lyrics that tackle ills such as begging, drug abuse and corruption.</p>
      <p>“Yahaya Makaho is a singer with a difference,” said Ahmad Bello, a music critic and linguist at Bayero University in the city of Kano.</p>
      <p>“People love his songs not just for the beats but primarily for the messages embedded in them which touch on burning social issues.”</p>
      <p>Dwelling on sensitive subjects has proved problematic on occasion.</p>
      <p>Makaho upset some in northern Nigeria’s blind community after he wrote two singles that criticised the widespread practice of street begging – often the only means of earning an income for the visually impaired.</p>
      <p>“They ostracised me for exposing the ills of begging in my two tracks and dubbed me an enemy,” he said.</p>
      <p>Makaho managed to resolve the conflict and has now established a foundation that provides school tuition, uniforms and braille books to help disabled youths get an education.</p>
      <p>The singer’s fortune has soared and he now provides a comfortable life for his family.</p>
      <p>He has made the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia and hopes to be able to build a recording studio of his own.</p>
      <p>And as he racks up hit after hit, his success is providing an inspiration for blind people in his home region struggling to fulfil their potential.</p>
      <p>“I’m fascinated by his songs which I find very pleasing,” said Hamisu Mohammed, who lives at a colony for blind people in Kaduna.</p>
      <p>“Whenever I listen to Yahaya’s song being played on the radio I feel a sense of pride that he is one of us, the blind.”</p>
