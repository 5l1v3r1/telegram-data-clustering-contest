      <p>With Mick heading to the doctors for an appointment, Linda thinks she has no choice but to drive her son to school... but it turns out to be a decision she'll live to regret when she accidentally backs into another car.</p>
      <p>Convinced that no one has seen, Linda drives away, but little does she know someone has been watching her.</p>
      <p>Later, Linda comes out of the school with Chantelle after dropping Ollie off, only to find some of the other mums from the school waiting with a police officer.</p>

      <p>Linda fights to defend herself, but when the police ask her to take a breathalyser test she is left humiliated when she fails and is quickly arrested in front of everyone.</p>
      <p>Back at The Vic, Mick is oblivious to the drama that Linda has found herself caught up in and, with his focus on the pub wife swap, he doesn't notice that she is late home from the school run.</p>
