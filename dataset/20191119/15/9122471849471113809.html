      <h1>Jim Harbaugh’s Quote About His Michigan Team Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:05:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>This season didn’t begin the way Michigan hoped that it would, but Jim Harbaugh and his coaching staff have finally found their groove in November.</p>
      <p>Michigan has won three-straight games in convincing fashion since losing to Penn State on Oct. 19, which includes a dominant win over Notre Dame.</p>
      <p>Last Saturday, the Wolverines dismantled the Michigan State Spartans in their annual rivalry game. Shea Patterson had an incredible performance, throwing for 384 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
      <p>When asked about the team’s improved play, Harbaugh dropped the quote of the year.</p>
      <p>“You can’t plant potatoes one day and expect to eat potato salad the next day,” Harbaugh said.</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      <p>This is an interesting way of saying it takes time for teams to find their identity.</p>
      <p>Harbaugh needs his team to continue improving as they have a matchup with Ohio State very soon. He’s yet to defeat the Buckeyes in his tenure with the Wolverines – albeit the previous meetings were against Urban Meyer.</p>
      <p>Before Michigan can set its sights on Ohio State, the team must take care of business on the road against Indiana this weekend.</p>
      <p>We’ll find out soon enough if Harbaugh and the Wolverines will make more potato salad this weekend.</p>
