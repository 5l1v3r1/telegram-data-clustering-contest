      <h2>New Delhi (Sputnik): The Indian side has already trained Maldivian cricket coaches. The move is part of a plan to deepen relations with the Maldives which have previously had strong links with China.</h2>

      <p>The Indian government has announced that groups of men and women from the Maldives are visiting the southern city of Chennai to receive intensive cricket training.</p>
      <p>The Indian embassy in Male said that India is “looking forward to working with the Cricket Board of Maldives."</p>
      <p>“A week-long level training course for Maldivian coaches concluded on 14 November. As a next step, Board of Control for Cricket in India umpire coaches led by Shavir Tarapore will conduct level-2 umpiring courses for 23 local umpires from 19-26 November,” the Indian embassy in Male stated in an official statement.</p>
      <p>The cricket diplomacy with the Maldives started in March this year when Male requested India's help to build a cricket stadium on the island.</p>
      <p>Sensing the opportunity to use its soft diplomacy to turn around the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201810181069004630-maldives-transfer-of-power/">poor bilateral relations</a> during the Abdulla Yameen government, India accepted the request and announced the initiative during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih in June.</p>
      <p>The stadium- building with the help of line of credit extended by New Delhi- is to take place on Hulhumale, an island south of North Male atoll.</p>
      <blockquote>China had previously built the “China-Maldives Friendship Bridge” which connects Hulhumale with the capital Male.</blockquote>
      <p>Spread over nearly 1,200 islands spanning more than 90,000 sq. km, the Maldives has become one of major <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201906061075691597-india-inaugurates-coastal-radar-maldives/">areas where India and China are vying for influence.</a> China has already invested millions of dollars in the islands under its Belt and Road Initiatives.</p>
