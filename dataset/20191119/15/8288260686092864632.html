      <h2>Birmingham City go to Huddersfield hoping to have discovered the secret of footballing alchemy during the international break, how to turn chances into goals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham City resume their Championship campaign on Saturday with a trip to rejuvenated Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p>The Terriers were little short of terrible at the start of the season after dropping out of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>However, the Cowley brothers Danny and Nicky have steadied the listing ship and this weekends jaunt to the John Smith’s Stadium is rather more difficult than it might have been a couple of months ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues </a>go there hoping to have discovered the secret of footballing alchemy during the international break, how to turn base goal-scoring chances into actual goals.</p>
      <p>We spoke to Huddersfield’s ExaminerLive sports editor Mel Booth for an insight into what to expect.</p>

      <h4>Have the Cowleys turned Huddersfield’s season around?</h4>
      <p>Most definitely. Town were careering towards a second successive relegation, having taken just one point from the opening six Championship matches, when the Cowley brothers were appointed.</p>
      <p>Town had also suffered a miserable Carabao Cup exit at the hands of the Cowleys’ Lincoln City and confidence within the squad was completely shot.</p>
      <p>Even though Town lost their first two matches under the Cowleys, leaving the club with a record of just one win in 35 matches, there were signs of improvement and that proved the case as they went on a seven-match unbeaten run, including four wins, to lift themselves out of the Championship relegation zone.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>What have you made of Birmingham’s season so far?</h4>
      <p>Looking in from the outside, the biggest problem seems to be consistency for the Blues - it’s been win or lose pretty much throughout the campaign.</p>
      <p>Those two away wins at Brentford and, particularly, high-riding Charlton stand out, however, and will be a worry to Town fans, especially with Birmingham looking to recover from successive defeats.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>How can Huddersfield hurt Blues?</h4>
      <p>The obvious answer is to get the ball to Karlan Grant around the box.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been a revelation since signing from Charlton Athletic for £2m in January and he has bagged nine goals already this season in just 16 appearances.</p>
      <p>Town also have pace out wide from Adama Diakhaby and, through the middle, from Juninho Bacuna, who has four goals in his last seven Championship outings, three of those while coming off the bench.</p>

      <h4>How can Blues get at Huddersfield?</h4>
      <p>Just watch the video of Preston North End’s 3-1 win over the Terriers last time out.</p>
      <p>Town have lost Tommy Elphick from the centre of their defence because he’s had knee ligament surgery and Danny Cowley will have to wait for injury updates on full-backs Danny Simpson and Jaden Brown (who missed the game at Preston) before deciding on his back four.</p>
      <p>Dutch international Terence Kongolo may well get the nod alongside Christopher Schindler, but Town have been put under plenty of pressure by teams with an aerial threat this season, so Lukas Jutkiewicz could be crucial.</p>

      <h4>How has Reece Brown been getting on?</h4>
      <p>He has played just once this season, in the disastrous Carabao Cup exit to Lincoln, when he was taken off after 77 minutes.</p>
      <p>Has been playing regularly in the Elite Development Team and has been both assisting and scoring goals.</p>
      <p>Danny Cowley says he likes Brown’s creativity and guile but adds that Brown “is trying to get into a place where he can cope with the athleticism and physicality of the Championship and that is something we are working hard on with him.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Prediction time - what will be the result and why?</h4>
      <p>Town are unbeaten in their last four home games so I am going for Town 2 Birmingham City 1.</p>
      <p>That goes against the excellent record Birmingham have at the John Smith’s Stadium - does anyone still remember that Town FA Cup win in 2008 or Ian Bennett letting in three back in 1996?</p>
      <p>I’m going for the Cowley factor to turn that record around.</p>
