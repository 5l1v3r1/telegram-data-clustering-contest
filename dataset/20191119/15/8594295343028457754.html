      <p>If you hop around this country on a semi-regular basis, you’ve likely noticed that California seems better equipped to endure the onslaught of electric vehicles poised to reshape our society. For all the complaints about the state’s managerial issues and a homelessness situation that’s spinning wildly out of control, it’s one of the few places you can regularly encounter EV charging stations without actively looking.</p>
      <p>It’s also an area you see them frequently in use. Many states still harbor large distances between charge points that don’t see a lot of use in the first place. But things are different in California. There are dedicated EV stations along most major highways, increasing in frequency the closer to you get to metropolitan hubs. Once inside the city limits, there are are countless office parks, service stations, and parking structures offering ground-floor charging — many of which will actually have cars plugged into them.</p>
      <p>You’ll also notice many are broken and some don’t let you pay via a single swipe of your credit card. Instead, the machine will ask you to make an account with whatever company is offering the service, often trying to push you into using a proprietary app. It’s unfortunate and probably the last thing you want to do after scouting out a particularly well-hidden station because the first three you came across were occupied or out of order. </p>
      <p>Of the 60,000+ public charging connections estimated in the U.S. by the Department of Energy, roughly 22,000 reside in California. <a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/california-has-power-shape-americas-charging-grid"><i>Automotive News</i></a> is concerned this won’t be sufficient to help the state embrace electrification at the frequency it’s aiming for. The brunt of those stations are said to be “a patchwork” of slower-charging ports that take several hours to juice up modern-day EVs. The outlet argues California will need newer, faster stations made available in more easily accessible areas if electrification is ever to truly take off like the state’s leadership desires.</p>
      <p>From <i>Automotive News:</i></p>
      <blockquote>While early EV adopters often charge at home, public options are critical to promote ownership by people who need to charge at work or add miles while on the road, advocates say. The California Energy Commission estimates about 100,000 to 150,000 public chargers are needed [in the state] to support a goal of 1.5 million zero-emissions vehicles by 2025.<br/><br/>“We know when we talk to EV candidate drivers that, beyond the upfront cost of the vehicle, their next questions are commonly: How far can this thing go? And, where can I refuel my car?” said Josh Boone, executive director of the nonprofit group Veloz, whose members include automakers, government agencies and EV charging companies.<br/>“So we know that having a reliable, redundant, ubiquitous charging network up and down the state of California is really important to a successful EV market,” Boone told <i>Automotive News</i>. How much investment is required to reach those goals is a difficult question because EV range and charging speeds are rapidly improving. “I don’t think anyone can answer that question. I think what we know is that we need more,” he said.</blockquote>
      <p>However, it’s a still tale of two <i>very</i> separate worlds. As someone who routinely makes the 600-mile journey between New York and Michigan, your author has noticed the number of electric vehicle one sees quickly drops the further west you travel on I-80. By the time you hit Pennsylvania, EV charging points are mostly limited to Walmart shopping centers and state parks located a few miles off the main highway — giving motorists something to do while they wait for their vehicle to recoup energy. But investigating these locations often shows them to be empty.</p>
      <p>It’s like that in a lot of places that aren’t California.</p>
      <p>While ramping up charging points would assuredly ease the burden and assuage a few range-related fears in the Golden State, there are many issues it doesn’t address. The price of EVs remains prohibitively high for many (even with government incentives) and their maximum range will continue to remain a problem until battery-driven vehicles can charge as quickly as their gas-powered brethren — or start offering ranges on the outer limits of what a single driver can endure per day.</p>
      <p>In truth, setting up more EV charging points seems like an expensive bandaid that tries to fix a fundamental limitation of present-day battery technology. Future EVs will continue to need new charging stations as the years roll on. But what else can we do if we’re supposed to get serious about the global electrification of cars?</p>
      <p>Whereas automobiles that burn gasoline don’t need a new type of pump as they evolve, EVs will continue requiring new charging areas with ever-higher output and new ports. Faster charging means more current and we’ve already seen how the first generation of electric vehicles are not compatible with the latest round of DC fast-chargers. It’s not a stretch to presume this event could repeat itself several times until EVs finally surpass internal combustion vehicles in terms of range or “refueling” speed. On the upside, it ought to guarantee plenty of construction projects through the middle of this century. Still, it’s going to take a nearly unfathomable amount of money to make this happen on a global scale, and it’s doubtful automakers will want to continue picking up the check after 2025.</p>
