      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:42:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Spice Girl <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mel-b">Mel B</a> has opened up about a "beautiful" five year relationship with a woman.</p>
      <p>She's the host of new podcast The Truth Flirts, and gave guest, Love Island's Megan Barton-Hanson, a break from the mic by chatting about her own love life.</p>
      <p>Megan spoke about how she probably wouldn't date another man and would be sticking with women, prompting Mel- who's previously bragged about her "huge libido and great sex life" - to discuss the differences in dating men and women.</p>
      <p>"I do think that dating women is very different to dating men," she told Megan bluntly.</p>

      <p>The 44 year old continued: "I had a five year relationship with a woman and it was an intense five years but it was actually a really beautiful five years.</p>
      <p>"We barely argued, because we both thought the same, wanted the same out of life. It was really interesting when I actually compare it to my other relationships."</p>
      <p>While Mel never names the woman she's talking about, it's possible she could have meant US film producer Christine Crokos - their romance lasted between 2002 and 2006.</p>

      <p>She told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk">The Guardian</a> : "I had a girlfriend. So what? I did have a four year relationship with a woman.</p>
      <p>"People call me a lesbian, bisexual or heterosexual, but I know who's in my bed."</p>
      <p>A year after she ended her relationship with Christine, she married her second husband Stephen Belafonte.</p>
      <p>Mel also revealed her attitude to first dates, and how important looks are to her to make a good first impression.</p>
      <p>"On that first date," she said, "Looks are everything because it's the first thing that you see."</p>
      <p>Scary Spice made waves earlier this year when she claimed she'd bedded Ginger Spice, Geri Halliwell.</p>
