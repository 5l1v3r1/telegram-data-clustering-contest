      <p>Epsom &amp; Ewell were the latest Combined Counties League Division I club to be brushed aside at Springfield on Saturday, with the Bulls – without nine key players due to Inter-League Cup commitments – keeping their UK opponents at arms length throughout the game.</p>
      <p>Freeman praised his side and admitted that some performances have planted a selection seed in his mind ahead of next weekend’s home clash with Cove.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘The lads who came in for the game, I can do nothing but praise them. It is difficult to come back and go out again but they stood up and performed.</p>
      <p>‘We spoke before the game and one thing we said was if you are unavailable and someone comes in and does well, it will give us hard decisions.</p>
      <p>‘We asked the lads to make it hard for us next week and no doubt some of them have stepped up and done that, and they got us the result.’</p>
      <p>Freeman lost the majority of his usual starters to the JFA Combination side, who won in extra time in their away cup tie against Amateur Football Combination on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Bulls chief, who represented the Island himself, said he would never stand in the way of a youngster wanting to represent Jersey but added that he would prefer not to see games on the same day.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I think in a perfect world the games wouldn’t be on the same day.</p>
      <p>‘A few lads came to speak to us about what to do. I was lucky enough to play for Jersey a few times and the last thing I would do is go and tell a young player he can’t play for Jersey.</p>
      <p>‘We have 30 players and we will use them. Some days it will be tougher to grind out [but] we will go down that route.’</p>
