      <p>The husband of missing Missouri woman Jennifer Rothwell led authorities to what they believe is her corpse, police said.</p>
      <p>The body of an adult white female was found at about 11:15 p.m. Monday after Beau Rothwell, 28, provided information to investigators through his attorney directing them to a remote area near Troy, roughly 45 miles northwest of the couple’s St. Louis County home, police said.</p>
      <p>The remains were found in an area off US Highway 61, about 20 yards off the shoulder in a wooded area, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters during a news conference, <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-find-body-in-lincoln-county-believed-to-be-missing/article_74f8afa7-e019-5562-9014-43c6780eca43.html">according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to follow up with DNA to do a total confirmation to make sure it is Jennifer Rothwell, but I do believe and detectives believe it is her,” Belmar said.</p>
      <p>Beau Rothwell remains jailed without bail on charges of second-degree murder and evidence tampering. Police said he was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/jennifer-rothwell-case-husband-of-missing-missouri-woman-bought-cleaning-supplies-before-she-vanished-cops-say/">spotted on surveillance video buying cleaning supplies</a> like bleach, gloves and carpet cleaner one day before he reported his wife missing on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Rothwell, also 28, had been presumed dead after large spots of blood were found on carpet and carpet padding inside their home. Charges against Beau Rothwell were upgraded after investigators used DNA samples from Jennifer’s parents to confirm that the blood inside the home was hers, police said.</p>
      <p>Police have not provided a motive in the slaying. Rothwell’s attorney told the Post-Dispatch in a statement that he has been cooperating with detectives in the ongoing investigation to “bring closure to this case” and to everyone involved.</p>
      <p>Detectives suspect that Rothwell killed his wife on Nov. 11, just two days before he posted a plea on Facebook for help.</p>
      <p>“Some of you may have heard already, but last night my wife Jennifer went missing,” Rothwell wrote. “I’ve filed a police report and the search is ongoing. Please, if you hear of anything or have any information it would be greatly appreciated.”</p>
      <p>Acquaintances of the couple, meanwhile, said they were startled to learn of the accusations facing Beau Rothwell.</p>
      <p>“He never expressed anything but good things about his wife, his marriage, his home,” friend Steven Farber told the Post-Dispatch.</p>
