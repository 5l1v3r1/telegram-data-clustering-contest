      <p>EDMONTON – The so-called Wexit movement might be grabbing a lot of headlines but a <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/alberta-wexit-separation-poll-abacus-data/">new poll</a> finds most Albertans want their province to remain a part of Canada.</p>
      <p>“One out of four Albertans say they’d vote to separate from Canada,” explained <a href="https://twitter.com/Colettod?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Coletto</a> with <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/">Abacus Data</a>. He said the separation movement remains a minority in Alberta, with his latest survey showing 75 per cent of people in the province want to keep the country united.</p>
      <p>Only 18 per cent who responded said they’d be happy with the province separated, another 18 per cent said they’d be “okay with it”.</p>

      <p>But three-quarters of those polled also say they feel like Alberta is being treated unfairly by the rest of the country in terms of energy and equalization policies.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“There’s a broad sense of frustration, of alienation,” said Colletto adding that does pose some political challenges for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
      <p>If the prime minister can’t address the frustrations and concerns in the prairies, he risks adding fuel to the separation spark.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>However, Coletto there is an opportunity for Trudeau as well since most of Albertans don’t want to separate.</p>
      <p>“Most Albertans haven’t taken the step yet to say we’re done with Canada. Most believe we can solve this problem.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the poll finds most of the separatists are Conservatives. Coletto says this could cause issues for the Tories because it could further brand them as a party of the west when the party needs to grow its base in the east if they want to win the next election.</p>
