      <p>Tottenham have sacked head coach Mauricio Pochettino after five years in charge of the club.</p>
      <p>“We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste,” said Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.”</p>
      <p>Spurs have endured a difficult start to the 2019-20 campaign after reaching last season’s Champions League final.</p>
      <p>The club languish in 14th in the Premier League, winning just three games in 12.</p>
      <p>Their last league match saw them draw 1-1 at Everton which marked five league games without a win. Spurs’ most recent league win came against Pochettino’s former club Southampton on September 28th.</p>
      <p>Tottenham return to action on Saturday against West Ham in the Premier League.</p>
