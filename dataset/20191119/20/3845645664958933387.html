      <p>Dozens of exhausted pro-democracy protesters occupying a Hong Kong university defied warnings to surrender Tuesday on the third day of a stand-off with police, as China sent fresh signals that its patience with nearly six months of unrest was running out.</p>
      <p>Fearing arrest or being shot at by police, a dwindling number of protesters remained huddled inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) as night fell.</p>

      <p>The siege at PolyU began Sunday with many hundreds of protesters occupying the campus as part of a broader campaign of massive disruption across Hong Kong that began last week.</p>
      <p>The ensuing confrontation turned into the most intense and prolonged of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy crisis, which has seen millions take to the streets since June to voice anger at China’s erosion of the territory’s freedoms.</p>
      <p>During the siege, protesters had repelled police surges with a barrage of Molotov cocktails, arrows and bricks. Police in response threatened to use live rounds.</p>

      <p>Some protesters escaped overnight on Monday by shinning down ropes from a footbridge to a road, where they were whisked away on motorbikes.</p>
      <p>Others disappeared into manholes to try to probe the drainage system for a route out.</p>
      <p>In an apparently co-ordinated effort to distract police, tens of thousands of people streamed towards the PolyU campus on Monday night as clashes simultaneously raged with police in nearby Kowloon district.</p>
      <p>
        <b> New phase of violence </b>
      </p>
      <p>Footage on Monday showed armoured police beating fallen protesters with batons as they lay on the ground.</p>
      <p>One officer was filmed stamping on the head of a man who was already subdued.</p>

      <p>Alleged police brutality is one of the central complaints of the protest movement. Senior officers insist their men are acting proportionately.</p>
      <p>In her first public comments on the PolyU crisis, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said surrender was the only way to achieve a peaceful outcome.</p>
      <p>“This objective could only be achieved with the full cooperation of the protesters, including of course the rioters.</p>

      <p>“They have to stop violence, give up the weapons and come out peacefully and take the instructions from the police,” she said.</p>
      <p>Lam said children who surrendered would not be arrested, though protesters aged over 18 would face charges of rioting.</p>
      <p>About 1,000 people had been arrested throughout Hong Kong over the previous 24 hours, Chief Superintendent Kwok Ka-chuen said on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>This was roughly a fifth of all arrests since the unrest began in June.</p>
      <p>Kwok said those arrested included some who had abseiled from the footbridge, as well as motorcyclists who helped them.</p>
      <p>And in an apparent contradiction of Lam, Kwok insisted everyone would feel the force of the law.</p>
      <p>“No excuse, no political demand or motive can spare anyone from legal liability,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Regardless of their age and causes, they are to face the consequences of their own actions.”</p>
      <p>
        <b> Determination </b>
      </p>
      <p>With police custody their best option, some inside PolyU were determined to fight on.</p>
      <p>“Even if we surrender they will still put us to jail. It seems we have two options, but actually we only have one… which is jail,” one of the protesters, a mechanical engineering student who gave his name as Matthew, told AFP inside the campus.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But their numbers were dwindling. AFP reporters on site estimated up to 100 remained by late afternoon.</p>
      <p>The new phase of mass disruption, which began last week, has caused chaos throughout the international financial hub, with schools closed, train lines disrupted and major roads blocked by barricades.</p>
      <p>With the crisis deepening, China’s ambassador to Britain upped the ante on Monday.</p>
      <p>“If the situation becomes uncontrollable, the central government would certainly not sit on our hands and watch,” Liu Xiaoming said. “We have enough resolution and power to end the unrest.”</p>
      <p>In another ominous signal, China insisted Tuesday it had sole authority to rule on constitutional matters in Hong Kong, which it rules under a special model giving the city greater freedoms than enjoyed on the mainland.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The warning came as it condemned a decision by the city’s high court on Monday to overturn a ban on face masks worn by pro-democracy protesters.</p>
      <p>Only China’s parliament has the right to rule on Hong Kong’s Basic Law — the city’s mini-constitution, parliament spokesman Zang Tiewei said.</p>
      <p>“No other institution has the right to make judgements or decisions,” he said.</p>
      <p>A mainland scholar who requested anonymity to speak freely about such a sensitive subject said while the parliament had the right to take away what it gave, the timing of the announcement was ill-advised.</p>

      <p>“Such a statement would gravely affect people’s views on the principle of ‘One Country, Two System’.”</p>
      <p>Carrie Lam has repeatedly insisted that her unpopular police force can contain the unrest, and said Tuesday there was currently no need for the People’s Liberation Army to intervene.</p>
      <p>Protests started in June as a peaceful condemnation of a now-shelved China extradition bill.</p>
      <p>They morphed into a broader movement to defend the city’s unique freedoms, which were meant to be enshrined in the Basic Law when Hong Kong was handed over by Britain in 1997.</p>
