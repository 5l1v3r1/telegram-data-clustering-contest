      <h1>Real Madrid to consider recalling Jesus Vallejo from Wolverhampton Wanderers?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> are allegedly considering whether to cut short <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jesus-vallejo/"><b>Jesus Vallejo</b></a>'s loan spell at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/wolves/"><b>Wolverhampton Wanderers</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Despite having been expected to be a regular in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nuno-espirito-santo/"><b>Nuno Espirito Santo</b></a>'s starting lineup, Vallejo has made just six starts and one substitute outing in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has also played just 162 minutes of Premier League, which has led to <i>Defensa Central</i> claiming that Real could recall the centre-back in January.</p>
      <p>The report states that while there is no ill feeling towards Wolves, there is currently concern that Vellejo will not be ready to rejoin Real's first-team squad next season.</p>
      <p>The Spanish giants are likely to assess Vallejo's game time up until the beginning of 2020 before making a final decision.</p>
