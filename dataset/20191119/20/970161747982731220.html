      <p>Jaws across the country dropped tonight as Emmerdale <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">slotted in a surprise twist for returning villain </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein). The sex offender, who groomed teenager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) into a relationship, was released after serving a portion of her sentence.</p>
      <p>Sporting a heavily pregnant belly, she deleted Jacob’s number but Jacob refuses to give up getting in touch with her as he remains in love with her. He wants them to have a future together but it remains to be seen where the story goes from here.</p>
      <p>Viewers have been reacting with shock as Emmerdale had played down suggestions that Maya would reappear in the show. It is unconfirmed whether Maya will come back to the show full time but it seems inevitable that the storyline will he revisited now that this extra baggage has been piled on.</p>

      <p>Having sat on the secret herself and been forced to remain coy in interviews about whether she could ever come back, Louisa broke her silence on Twitter, asking followers if they saw that coming.</p>
      <p>Apart from one or two who insisted that they guessed (sure, Jan), many responded with genuine surprise, with some claiming it the ‘twist of the year’.</p>
      <p>Of course, it means turmoil ahead for Jacob and his dad David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) as they must eventually find out the truth about Maya’s baby. But will Jacob and Maya reunite – or will she decide against risking contacting him as it would mean going back inside and giving birth in prison?</p>

      <p>In the episode, David promised to report Maya if Jacob succeeded in making contact with her – to which he hit back that he would hate him forever.</p>
      <p>Emmerdale currently remain tight lipped over where the storyline goes from here but it looks like things are going to be very complicated in 2020.</p>
