      <h1>Disney+ accounts are being stolen and sold online</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:21:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/rachelkaser/" target="_blank">Rachel Kaser</a></address>
      <p>Scarcely a week after the service debuted, Disney+ accounts area already being hacked en masse. Users report their accounts being hacked within hours of creation, and now those same accounts are being sold online.</p>
      <p>The reported account theft goes about how you’d expect: the malicious party logs into the account and changes the email address and password, effectively nabbing the account for themselves. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">ZDNet conducted</a> a dark web investigation and found hundreds of accounts for sale, some for as little as $3. Depending where you looked, you might find some given away for free. The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50461171">later corroborated</a> those findings with their own. The average going price for a Disney+ account appears to be slightly less than a subscription fee.</p>
      <p>Disney+ hasn’t had the most stable launch — highly disappointing, considering the money and time Disney’s obviously invested in it. The app was <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2019/11/12/disney-plus-launch-technical-issues/">plagued by technical difficulties</a>, often refusing to work entirely on some devices. For many, the lack of customer service support compounded the issue — many users report being hung up on or left on perpetual hold. It’s not as though the platform’s success should come as a surprise, given that it already has over <a href="https://thenextweb.com/video/2019/11/13/netflix-partners-with-nickelodeon-disney-plus/">10 million subscribers</a> a week after launch.</p>
      <p>A Disney spokesperson told the BBC that the fault was not on its end: “Disney takes the privacy and security of our users’ data very seriously and there is no indication of a security breach on Disney+.” It’s possible this is all down to bad security practices on the part of the individual users. But still, the platform doesn’t much help matters by not having something like two-factor authentication — and you can’t remove devices from the account. So if someone steals your account and logs it into enough devices that you hit the limit, then you’re out of luck.</p>
      <p>So to anyone who’s feeling a little paranoid about the security of their account, the best advice we can offer at the moment is to change your password into something you’re not using elsewhere — just to be safe.</p>
