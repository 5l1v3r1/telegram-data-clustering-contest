      <p>Addressing media earlier today, Kamal Haasan said that coming together of the two actors should not be surprising given their friendship for 44 years.</p>
      <p>When reporters queried him if he and Rajinikanth would get together politically, Kamal Haasan responded, "There is no miracle in our joining hands. We have been together for 44 years. If the need comes for us to get together (in politics) then we will. Right now, work is important, talking about this is not. For the benefit of the people of Tamil Nadu, we can take this journey together."</p>
      <p>The Hindu <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/will-rajinikanth-and-kamal-haasan-pair-up-for-the-polls/article30010506.ece">quoted</a> C.K. Kumaravel, General Secretary (Organisation), MNM as saying, “This is a decision that Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth have to take together. First, Rajinikanth has to start a party.”</p>
      <p>While Kamal Haasan had earlier suggested that Rajinikanth’s alleged ‘saffron’ ideologicial predilections, Kumaravel suggested that managing contradiction is part of the politics “When the PMK, which criticised the AIADMK so much, can work with the AIADMK when facing the polls, why can’t two lifelong friends work together? It is very much possible.”</p>
      <p>In an event earlier this week in Chennai, actor Joseph Vijay's father and noted director S A Chandrasekaran requested Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan to strike alliance for the 2021 elections. Chandrasekaran claimed that coming together of the actors will represent a convergence between ‘class’ and ‘mass’.</p>
      <p>Rajinikanth on Sunday (17 November) had <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/insta/strong-buzz-on-alliance-between-actors-rajinikanth-and-kamal-haasan-to-fight-2-dravidian-parties-in-2021-tn-elections">hit back</a> at Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami who had last week mocked ageing cinema actors nursing political ambitions.</p>
      <p>Rajinikanth was speaking at an event in Chennai on Sunday (Nov 17) to celebrate 60 years of his contemporary Kamal Haasan’s journey in the Indian film industry. Rajinikanth copiously praised Kamal Haasan for this sterling contribution to the world of cinema.</p>
      <p>It is widely <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/fans-toil-for-rajinis-blockbuster-entry/articleshow/72100668.cms">speculated</a> that Rajinikanth, who has already announced his plans to plunge in to electoral politics, will float his political party by July-August 2020 and fight the state assembly elections in 2021.</p>
