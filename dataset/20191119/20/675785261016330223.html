      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire for accusations that he would It came as the pair clashed on ITV in the first live TV debate of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> accused the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader of expecting to form a coalition with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> leader Nicola Sturgeon - plunging to the UK into referendums on the EU and Scottish Independence.</p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn said he would not be joining any coalition - and gave a snappy answer as to why.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said: " <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> and the Labour Party, be in no doubt about it, in order to secure power and the keys to number 10 are going to do a deal, or probably already have done a deal with Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to form Corbyn-Sturgeon coalition and the price of that deal ... would be a second referendum on the union with Scotland.</p>
      <p>But Mr Cobyn branded that he was allowed to reply to this "nonsense" and said he would do no deals with the SNP.</p>
      <p>He quipped: "There has  been nine years of chaotic coalitions already.”</p>

      <p>On the SNP Mr Corbyn said: "If the SNP leadership choose to put the Conservative government back in power with their austerity programme, that’s their choice"</p>
      <p>The leaders of the UK's two major parties went head-to-head in an hour-long debate hosted by Julie Etchingham in Salford's MediaCityUK.</p>
      <p>It gave Mr Corbyn an opportunity to make up ground on the Conservatives as opinion polls showed Labour trailing behind.</p>
      <p>But Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon branded Mr Johnson a "scaredy-cat" over his refusal to debate her, saying she would face him "any time, any place".</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems and the SNP yesterday lost a High Court battle to have their leaders included in the debate.</p>
