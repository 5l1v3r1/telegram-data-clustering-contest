      <h3>Is Adele Roberts related to Jane McDonald?</h3>
      <p>Despite what some viewers were tweeting last night, Adele and Jane are not related – the Radio 1 DJ just appears to have immense admiration for the talk show panelist.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Ahead of the task to win the items, Adele said her luxury item was a picture of ‘someone really special [to me]’.</p>
      <p>She later explained: ‘She’s my favourite Loose Woman, she’s going to get me through the jungle, I love her.</p>
      <p>‘She is a national treasure, she is the queen of Wakefield,’ Adele told her pals. ‘Just think, whenever you’re going off to a trial, just give her a lucky rub and off you go.’</p>

      <h3>Have Adele Roberts and Jane McDonald met?</h3>
      <p>Jane admitted the pair are yet to meet, however, said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jane-mcdonald-watched-im-celebs-adele-roberts-luxury-item-reveal-pants-gives-seal-approval-11180740/">she was keen to catch up once Adele was out of the jungle</a>.</p>
      <p>She said she was ‘absolutely gobsmacked’ to learn she was the campmate’s luxury item.</p>
      <p>Speaking on This Morning, Jane said: ‘I was just like… my phone started going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!</p>
      <p>‘I just sat on the edge of the bed in my underwear, and watched it on Plus One, and just thought, “oh my goodness, me!” I could not believe it.’</p>
      <p>After watching the episode unfold, Jane said she was ‘absolutely thrilled’ to see her face in the jungle and wished Adele the best.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: ‘@AdeleRoberts I flipping love you. Best of luck.’</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Adele’s partner Kate Holderness has commented on the bizarre choice of item admitting the campmate had wanted to take a family photo to the jungle.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>However the rules dictated each luxury item has to be different, and as others were already taking in pictures of loved ones, Adele had to improvise.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Twitter, Kate wrote: ‘Adele’s first choice of a family photo was already taken which she didn’t mind because she knew there’d be campmates who’d love a pic of their children with them.</p>
      <p>‘Second choice, a pillow, was another goner as it’s usually the most requested item.’</p>
      <p>Kate said ‘pretty much everything’ Adele had wanted as her luxury item had already been asked for by other campmates, and so she chose something that ‘never failed to cheer her up’ and reminded the DJ of her listeners.</p>
      <p>Kate explained: ‘It’s a bit of a running feature on Adele’s show, when [listeners are] having a bit of a slump and feeling down, a listener will request a “bit of Jane” to get them through the day!’</p>
