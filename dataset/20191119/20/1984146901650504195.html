      <h2>James Hunter's verdict on the Black Cats from their FA Cup replay against Gillingham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:39:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland are level at half-time against Gillingham in their FA Cup first-round replay following a thoroughly uninspiring first half.</p>
      <p>Neither side were able to create a chance of note at Priestfield, with Luke O'Nien perhaps coming closest for the visitors.</p>
      <p>At the other end, Brandon Hanlan has looked the most likely for the Gills, but Lee Burge has not been called into action</p>
      <p>Here's how James Hunter rated the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> players at half-time of the FA Cup replay:</p>
      <p>LEE BURGE 6</p>
      <p>Hasn’t had a shot to save</p>
      <p>BRANDON TAYLOR 6</p>
      <p>Youngster has looked solid playing on the right-hand side of a back three</p>
      <p>ALIM OZTURK 6</p>
      <p>Not 100 percent fit but has done a decent job organising the back three</p>
      <p>LAURENS DE BOCK 6</p>
      <p>A stand-in centre-back, but has generally done OK</p>

      </figure>
      <p>LUKE O’NIEN 6</p>
      <p>Offered a threat going forward down the right</p>
      <p>MAX POWER 6</p>
      <p>A miscued cross forced Bonham to claw the ball from under his bar</p>
      <p>GRANT LEADBITTER 6</p>
      <p>Has seen quite a bit of the ball, but some of his passes have gone astray</p>
      <p>CHRIS MAGUIRE 5</p>
      <p>Yet to make an impression</p>
      <p>DENVER HUME 6</p>
      <p>A couple of dangerous forays down the left, but with no end product</p>
      <p>DUNCAN WATMORE 5</p>
      <p>Has seen little of the ball</p>
      <p>WILL GRIGG 5</p>
      <p>Struggled to get into the game but has had no service whatsoever</p>
