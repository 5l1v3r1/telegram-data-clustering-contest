      <h1>Agent confirms Real Madrid leading Barcelona in Milan Skriniar race</h1>
      <h2>A representative of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/milan-skriniar/"><b>Milan Skriniar</b></a> has claimed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> are close to agreeing a deal for the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/"><b>Inter Milan</b></a> defender.</h2>

      <p>Since moving to San Siro in 2017, Skriniar has established himself as one of the top centre-backs in European football, which has led to widespread interest in his signature.</p>
      <p>Despite the Slovakia international recently indicating that he has no plans to depart the Italian giants, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mithat-halis/"><b>Mithat Halis</b></a> has suggested that the 24-year-old may move to the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Halis is quoted by <i>AS as saying: "Skriniar is worth â‚¬100m. Real Madrid and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> are competing for his signing for the last two years.</i></p>
      <p>"Now Real Madrid are closer to reaching agreement with Inter Milan because they want and they need him much more than Barcelona."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/"><b>Manchester City</b></a> have also been linked with a bid for the player.</p>
