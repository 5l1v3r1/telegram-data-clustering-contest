        <b>Emmerdale has revealed that paedophile <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein) is pregnant with her victim <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a>’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) baby as she is released from prison. She served half her sentence and Jacob remains as adamant as ever that he is going to be with her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) followed Jacob after he headed to try and meet Maya from prison and he thought that he had got through to him – but Jacob decided that he was still in love with Maya and kept trying to contact her.</p>
      <p>As Maya left the prison after her incarceration, she deleted Jacob’s number but was sporting a pregnant stomach – meaning Jacob has a bombshell on the way that will complicate everything.</p>
      <p>Will the pair reunite? And how will David react?</p>
      <p>It’s a twist that was held back from fans and it seems like more chapters of the long running storyline – which won the soap several Inside Soap Awards – are set to play out over coming months. It has not been established whether Louisa is making a full term return to the show.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk recently, she wasn’t ruling it out and added that there could be more to explore but Emmerdale played down rumours and plans of a return – although that may have been to preserve the storyline development, which they wanted to be a surprise to viewers.</p>

      <p>With Jacob still hung up on Maya, things will also develop between him and teenager Leanna and, when they get close and sleep together, Liam Cavanagh will lash out at Jacob and end up arrested.</p>
      <p>But is Jacob genuinely in love with Leanna or is he using her as a smokescreen as he determines to wait out for a full reunion with Maya?</p>
      <p>Either way, the baby shock is set to change his life forever.</p>
