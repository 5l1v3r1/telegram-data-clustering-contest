      <p>“The re-establishment of the Commission will deliver a major Coalition agreement between New Zealand First and Labour.</p>
      <p>“We know that mental health and addiction issues are devastating our families and communities and the Mental Health Commission will be crucial to transforming support services for all New Zealanders.</p>
      <p>“Addressing our country’s mental health crisis is one of our key priorities in Government.</p>
      <p>“We are proud to be driving the return of the Mental Health Commission which will help improve outcomes and equity of wellbeing of all,” says Ms Marcroft.</p>
