      <h1>ESPN Analyst Doesn’t Think Oregon-Utah Would Be Close</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:32:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Oregon’s season opening loss to Auburn seemingly ended the Pac-12’s hopes of reaching the College Football Playoff. But college football is a crazy sport to try and predict. And a bit of chaos has opened the door for the Pac-12 to slip into the playoff discussion.</p>
      <p>The Ducks and Utah are bound to converge in the Pac-12 championship game, barring any conference chaos. Both teams are currently ranked within the top seven of the College Football Playoff rankings. Plenty of national experts believe the winner has a strong chance of being the fourth team selected for the playoff.</p>
      <p>With so much on the line in that potential championship game, it’s already garnering attention from analysts. One analyst in particular – former Washington State QB and current ESPN analyst Ryan Leaf – thinks Utah would blow out Oregon if the two teams were to play in early December.</p>
      <blockquote>“There’s a good chance that this Utah team could win this football game by 10 points to 14 points,” Leaf said on the <a href="https://twitter.com/BleavPodcasts/status/1196838741362532359">Bleav Podcast Network</a>. “That’s because of what I’ve seen over the last six weeks from Utah, not necessarily what I’ve seen in the last six weeks from Oregon. I think it’s going to be a great football game. But right now, I think Utah might be the better team.”</blockquote>

      <p>Oregon has been the talk of the Pac-12 for several weeks now. But is Utah the best team in the conference? Leaf seems to believe just that.</p>
      <p>The Utes don’t receive much attention. But they will if they can knock off the Ducks in the conference championship game. Then the question becomes – does a Utah win earn them a playoff bid?</p>
