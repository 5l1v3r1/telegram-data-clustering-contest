      <p>Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a motion seeking permission to take a DNA sample from Ibraheem Yazeed. A judge said he will hear arguments on the request Wednesday during an already scheduled hearing.</p>
      <p>Yazeed is <a href="https://wcti12.com/news/nation-world/suspect-in-aniah-blanchard-disappearance-arrested-faces-kidnapping-charges">charged in the disappearance </a>of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard. She was last seen Oct. 23 at a convenience store in Auburn, Alabama. She <a href="https://wcti12.com/news/nation-world/friends-hope-to-keep-aniah-blanchards-name-alive-as-search-continues">hasn't been found</a>.</p>
      <p>Her car was later found abandoned over 50 miles (90 kilometers) away. Police said the car contained evidence that Blanchard had <a href="https://wcti12.com/news/nation-world/blood-linked-by-dna-to-aniah-blanchard-found-in-her-vehicle">suffered a life-threatening injury</a>.</p>
      <p>The charging document says a witness identified 29-year-old Yazeed as the man he saw force Blanchard into a car.</p>
