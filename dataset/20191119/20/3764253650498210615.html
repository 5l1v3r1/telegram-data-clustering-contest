        <b>- Irish super boy band Westlife is well on their way to reaching their first UK number one album in 12 years</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- This is thanks to the group's new album, Spectrum</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- This release is currently outselling all of the Top 10 new releases combined</b>
      </p>
      <p>Westlife were always loved for their super smooth vocals and smouldering good looks.</p>
      <p>So, it's no wonder the pop world has welcomed the group back with open arms after a 12-year hiatus.</p>
      <p>The boys began their comeback with a sold-out tour earlier this year.</p>
      <p>They then released their album<i>,</i> <i>Spectrum, </i>on Friday, November 15. This album is their first release in nine years.</p>
      <p>The group was understandably nervous to see how it would be received. They have been pleasantly surprised by the response the record has been getting.</p>
      <p>Speaking to MailOnline, bandmate Mark Feehily said,<i> "I don't think any of us ever imagined that we'd be in contention for a number one album in our twentieth year but we've given everything into creating an album that feels fresh and relevant to 2019.</i></p>
