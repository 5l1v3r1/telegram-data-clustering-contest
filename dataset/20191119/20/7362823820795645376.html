      <h1>Maine owl gets lift in state trooper's patrol car after rescue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:14:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Gearty</a></address>
      <p>It was a tough night for one large owl but a hoot for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-sailboat-maine-coast-guard-found-safe-journey">Maine</a> state trooper, according to a report.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/electric-ford-mustang-mach-e">car</a> apparently struck the owl in Manchester, outside Augusta, Friday night, leaving it in a disoriented state in the middle of a busy road.</p>
      <p>That’s where a trooper on patrol, Sam Tlumac, found it, <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/maine-state-trooper-rescues-stunned-owl">WTHR-TV</a> reported Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Police posted a photo of the owl riding shotgun in Trooper Tlumac’s car.</p>
      <p>“Tlumac had to bring a person to jail (unrelated to the owl) and upon his return he checked on the owl, and it seemed much better,” the post said. “He brought the bird outside. It took flight into nearby trees.”</p>
