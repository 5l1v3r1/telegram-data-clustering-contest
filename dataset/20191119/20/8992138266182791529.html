      <h1>Interactive Brokers Jumps on Fractional Stock Trading Bandwagon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:26:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">Aziz Abdel-Qader</a></address>
      <p>After eliminating trading commissions two months ago, <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/interactive-brokers-beats-on-q3-revenue-as-tigers-plunge-eases/">Interactive Brokers</a> LLC (NASDAQ:IBKR) has updated <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atws.app&amp;hl=pl">its trading app</a> to provide its clients with the opportunity to trade fractions of stocks.</p>
      <p>The move, geared toward attracting more young clients, eliminates the barriers that many investors face when trying to invest in a diversified portfolio of U.S. listed securities. Fractional share trading allows investors diversify their investment portfolios by spreading their relatively small capital over a broader range of stocks.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/charles-schwab-rolls-out-robinhood-style-free-stock-trading/">Charles Schwab</a> was the first among US major brokers to let investors buy and sell fractions of stocks. As they look beyond no-fee trading war, the move could set off a new rush among other brokers to do the same amid increased competition in the industry to attract the next generation of investors.</p>
      <p>IB explains that the new feature comes in handy for both IBKR Lite and Pro clients who can’t afford pay a high price tag for companies like Amazon or Google.</p>

      <p>“Want to buy just $ 500 worth of an expensive stock like AMZN, or looking to diversify among more investments? Now you can – fractional share trading with the ability to enter order size in terms of dollar amounts is in gradual rollout,” the company said.</p>
      <h3>The race to the bottom</h3>
      <p>Earlier in October, <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/interactive-brokers-launches-commission-free-trading/">Interactive Brokers</a> cut trading commissions to zero, setting off a war among brokerages that led almost all competitors to drop fees on virtually the entire exchange-traded products later in the next month.</p>
      <p>Considering the new bar set by Schwab, IB’s response might be all the rest of the industry can do. As such, E*Trade, TradeStation, and Fidelity, having all moved to zero commission trading, could follow suit on fractional trading in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>The stock-trading business model of those financial giants now resembles the successful features of other players seeking to gain market share including those offering fractional share trading, <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/revolut-trading-head-well-add-more-than-just-us-stocks/">such as DriveWealth</a>.</p>
      <p>DriveWealth, which launched its fractional share trading capabilities in 2016, enables investors of any size to gain affordable access to the U.S. stock market from a range of countries, including India, Nigeria and Brazil.</p>
