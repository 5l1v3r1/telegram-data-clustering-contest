      <h1>West Ham considering Rafael Benitez approach?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-ham-united/"><b>West Ham United</b></a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rafael-benitez/"><b>Rafael Benitez</b></a> as a potential replacement for manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/manuel-pellegrini/"><b>Manuel Pellegrini</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Despite a promising start to the season, West Ham find themselves in 16th position in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League standings</a>, while they were also dumped out of the EFL Cup by Oxford United.</p>
      <p>Their recent form has resulted in uncertainty over the future of Pellegrini, who has been provided with the transfer funds to turn the Hammers into a top-six club.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Mirror</i>, the hierarchy at the east London outfit may approach Benitez if West Ham remain near the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Despite leaving Newcastle United for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/dalian-yifang/"><b>Dalian Yifang</b></a> this summer, the report claims that Benitez would be interested in a quick return to England.</p>
      <p>However, the Spaniard still has two years remaining on his contract with the Chinese Super League outfit.</p>
