      <p>Unless you’ve been hiding underneath a rock, you can’t have failed to notice <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-2019-start-date-time-line-hosts-11167643/">that I’m A Celebrity is back on our screens</a> for its 2019 series.</p>
      <p>The show kicked off on Sunday night, with the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Nadine Coyle, Roman Kemp and Kate Garraway <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-a-celebrity-2019-caitlyn-jenner-spends-first-night-in-snake-rock-on-basic-rations-11171818/">getting to grips with jungle life</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-transitioning-after-threatening-to-quit-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-on-day-two-11178492/">via some candid conversations</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-caitlyn-jenner-faces-a-snakepit-and-its-not-the-kardashians-in-hardest-bush-tucker-trial-yet-11180627/">predictably unpleasant Bushtucker trials.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-time-every-night-11168259/">The show is on every night for the next few weeks</a> – and as you might have noticed features a mix of pre-recorded highlights from the last 24 hours in camp, along with live inserts from Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>But while we get to see it at 9pm every night, just what time is it in Australia when it’s filmed?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>What is the time difference between the UK and Australia?</h3>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The time difference between the UK and Australia is 10 hours, with Australia being ahead of the UK rather than behind.</p>
      <p>That means that it’s already tomorrow morning down under by the time the show goes on air at 9pm.</p>
      <p>The clock onscreen during the live elements of the show makes this fairly obvious – as it’s normally just after 7am when Ant and Dec preview what we can expect from that night’s instalment.</p>
      <p>In other words, it’s a pretty early start all round there.</p>
      <h3>What time do they film in the I’m A Celebrity jungle?</h3>
      <p>There’s no given time as to when I’m A Celebrity is filmed, as the show features highlights from camp throughout the day and night.</p>

        <video src="https://videos.metro.co.uk/video/backup/2019/11/19/2558690759830125574/640x360_MP4_2558690759830125574.mp4"/>
      </figure>
      <p>However much of the action is filmed during the day and evening in Australia, meaning that the goings-on you see onscreen will have happened overnight or in the evening UK time.</p>
      <p>It also means that the results of Bushtucker trial votes and elimination votes are revealed to the camp first thing in the morning, although it’s not clear exactly how long the celebs have between finding out they have been chosen for a trial and actually doing it.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/where-is-im-a-celebrity-filmed-caitlyn-jenner-new-season-11171138/">The show is filmed</a> inside the Springbrook National Park in Murwillumbah, New South Wales.</p>
      <p>The series has been filmed there since its second series back in 2003, with the first having been shot in Cairns, Queensland.</p>
      <p>While viewers might only see the camp, the bridges, and Ant and Dec’s studio, there’s a whole HQ out there, which also includes an on-site medical facility, a space for props storage and an area for friends and family of the celebs to gather on the morning of each eviction.</p>
