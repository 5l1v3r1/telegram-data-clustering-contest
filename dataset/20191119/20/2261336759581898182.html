      <p>UFC 244’s doctor stoppage ending remains to be a topic two and a half weeks later. It’s so far garnered mixed reactions, just like the making of the fight itself.</p>
      <p>Ken Shamrock stands with those arguing that the fight shouldn’t have been stopped. For the UFC Hall-of-Famer, both Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz are veterans who should’ve been given a generous amount of leeway to fight on.</p>

      <p>“In my opinion, Diaz and Masvidal, you’ve got to let guys fight,” he told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/17/20960572/ken-shamrock-invites-jorge-masvidal-to-valor-bare-knuckle-wed-love-to-find-out-how-bad-he-is">MMA Fighting</a>. “These guys are both skilled fighters. They have a lot of fights under their belt, and they both know what they’re in for.</p>
      <p>“It’s just like with some of my fights that were stopped – it was just ridiculous. Oh yeah, I get it. They want to try and keep people safe. But don’t do that with guys that are veterans. The guys that have been in there a whole long time, you’ve got to give them a lot of leeway.”</p>
      <p>In the same interview, Shamrock also dared newly-minted “BMF” titleholder Jorge Masvidal to try his hand at Valor Bare Knuckle boxing to “<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/18/20970385/ufc-mma-news-interview-legend-ken-shamrock-jorge-masvidal-fight-bare-knuckle-valor">find out how bad he is</a>.”</p>
