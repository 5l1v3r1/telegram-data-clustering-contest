      <p>However Caitlyn’s best-known children came from her marriage to Kris Jenner – daughters Kendall, 24, and 22-year-old Kylie Jenner.</p>
      <p>Kendall is of course famous for her modelling career – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/09/kendall-jenner-enjoys-time-with-caitlyn-as-kylie-and-crew-celebrate-her-birthday-10543809/">and has been spotted enjoying some quality time with Caitlyn recently</a> – and Kylie is renowned for her cosmetics line Kylie Cosmetics, as well as for having 151m Instagram followers.</p>
      <p>Kylie is the mum of another of Caitlyn’s grandchildren, one-year-old daughter Stormi Webster from her relationship with Travis Scott.</p>
      <h3>Caitlyn Jenner’s stepchildren</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/">The marriage to Kris Jenner also saw Caitlyn gain four Kardashian stepchildren</a> – Kris’ daughters’ Kim Kardashian West, 39, Khloe Kardashian, 35 and 40-year-old Kourtney Kardashian, as well as Kris’ 32-year-old son Rob Kardashian.</p>

        <figcaption>Caitlyn and Kris are said to have an amicable relationship (Picture: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While things have previously been rocky between Caitlyn and the Kardashians – following the release of her memoir where it was perceived that she was making digs at Kris and the Kardashian lifestyle, it looks as though she has reconnected with family members of late.</p>
      <p>Kim was spotted at Caitlyn’s 70th birthday celebrations in October, while Caitlyn and Kris appear to be on good terms.</p>
      <h3>Who is Caitlyn Jenner dating?</h3>

      <p>Caitlyn is rumoured <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/02/old-caitlyn-jenner-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins-kardashians-star-tipped-im-celebrity-11029458/">to be dating 23-year-old Sophia Hutchins</a> – who is also a transgendered woman.</p>
      <p>Sophie said of Caitlyn: ‘We’re partners in everything we do, we’re inseparable, we’re business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share family, we share a life together.’</p>
      <p>Could she possibly become the fourth Mrs Jenner? Time will tell…</p>
