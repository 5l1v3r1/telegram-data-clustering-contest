      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> is the odds-on favourite to replace Mauricio Pochettino as manager of Tottenham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-extremely-disappointing-results-11184337/">Spurs released an official statement on Tuesday evening</a> confirming that Pochettino had been ‘relieved of his duties’, along with his coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez.</p>
      <p>The north London outfit reached the Champions League final and finished fourth in the Premier League last term but have struggled to live up to their recent heights in the early stages of this campaign.</p>
      <p>Pochettino oversaw just three wins from 12 matches in the English top flight this season and departs with Tottenham sitting just six points above the relegation zone in 14th place.</p>
      <p>The club were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Colchester United and are five points behind Bayern Munich in Champions League Group B.</p>

      <p>Chairman Daniel Levy said: ‘We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>

      <p>‘Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>‘It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the Club’s best interests.</p>
      <p>‘Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>‘We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.’</p>
      <p>Underneath Levy’s statement on Tottenham’s official website, the club revealed that they will ‘provide an update on new coaching staff in due course’.</p>
      <p>In a star-studded list of candidates to take over from Pochettino, one name stands head and shoulders above the rest. That name is Jose Mourinho.</p>
