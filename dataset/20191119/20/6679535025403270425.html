      <p>Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan has urged the Central government to hold talks with newly elected Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to secure the rights of Tamils in the island nation.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Mr. Vasan said Mr. Rajapaksa should take steps to guarantee the rights of Tamils. “The growth and security of Tamils, Christians and Muslims should be taken into account alongside the development and growth of the Sinhalese population,” he said.</p>
      <p>Just like India, Sri Lanka should take measures to ensure peace and harmony between followers of different religions as well as the majority and minority communities, he said.</p>
