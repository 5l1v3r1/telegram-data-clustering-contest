      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mason-greenwood/"><b>Mason Greenwood</b></a>'s first Under-21 goal looked to have earned <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aidy-boothroyd/"><b>Aidy Boothroyd</b></a>'s Young Lions a hard-fought draw before Dilrosun bent in a last-gasp winner to give the hosts a 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>England went into the game on the back of a Euro 2021 qualifying win in Albania but slipped to defeat in their final game of the year.</p>
      <p>Kaj Sierhuis opened the scoring from close-range at the midway point of the first-half as he tucked home past Bournemouth's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aaron-ramsdale/"><b>Aaron Ramsdale</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Dilrosun then tested Ramsdale as Holland enjoyed plenty of the ball with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/justin-kluivert/"><b>Justin Kluivert</b></a> causing plenty of problems for the England backline.</p>
      <p>Leicester's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-justin/"><b>James Justin</b></a> tested Holland goalkeeper Kjell Scherpen after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rhian-brewster/"><b>Rhian Brewster</b></a> had headed over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>With no breakthrough forthcoming, Boothroyd made four changes just after the hour-mark, introducing Greenwood alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dwight-mcneil/"><b>Dwight McNeil</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/reiss-nelson/"><b>Reiss Nelson</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/reece-james/"><b>Reece James</b></a>.</p>
      <p>But it was Manchester United forward Greenwood who would draw England level, latching onto <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/phil-foden/"><b>Phil Foden</b></a>'s raking pass and bullying Rick Van Drongelen off the ball and finishing coolly.</p>
      <p>Greenwood had another sight of goal late on but the game appeared to be heading for a stalemate until Dilrosun provided a moment of magic.</p>
      <p>With the clock ticking into stoppage time, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-sessegnon/"><b>Ryan Sessegnon</b></a> was penalised for fouling Ferdi Kadioglu 25 yards out from the England goal.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester City youngster Dilrosun stepped up and curled a perfect free-kick past a helpless Ramsdale to give Holland a dramatic victory at the death.</p>
