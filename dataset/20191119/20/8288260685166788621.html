      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:22:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United fans are fearing the worst after Lee Mason was revealed as the referee for next week’s clash against Aston Villa.</p>

      <p>Having been appointed by Newcastle in July, Bruce has won four of his 13 matches in charge of the Magpies, who sit four places and four points above <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Villa are hoping a number of injury concerns will be resolved in time for the clash, with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Jack Grealish</a> and Jota in line to return.</p>

      <p>Grealish is back in training having missed the last three games while Jota has been sidelined since the start of October.</p>
      <p>Bjorn Engels was a late omission from the travelling squad who lost at Wolves before the international break while Tom Heaton also missed out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Dean Smith said after that game: "What the international period will do will enable them to be fit for the Newcastle game.”</p>
      <p>Matt Targett went off injured at Molineux and the defender is expected to be fit, but Jed Steer faces a longer period on the treatment table while Keinan Davis remains out.</p>

      <p>But Newcastle fans have a big concern of their own following confirmation that Mason will be the man in the middle.</p>
      <p>The Bolton-born official hasn’t taken charge of any Newcastle games so far this season but <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-wolves-carabao-cup-17170538">has been involved in controversies with VAR since the new technology was brought in.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One fan said: “Congrats on the win Villa.”</p>
      <p>“Who's going to be rugby tackled this time?” asked another.</p>
      <p>A third simply added: “Oh dear.”</p>
