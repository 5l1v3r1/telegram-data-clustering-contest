      <h1>Investor vows to vote against Encana moving HQ from Calgary to Denver</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:19:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>CALGARY -- A Canadian investment management firm with a four per cent stake in Calgary-based Encana Corp. says it will vote against Encana's plan to move its headquarters to the United States.</p>
      <p>Letko, Brosseau &amp; Associates Inc. says the planned move to Denver would lead to Encana's removal from S&amp;P/TSX stock indexes.</p>
      <p>That would mean investors holding Encana through indexed Canadian funds or with Canadian-only investment policies would have to sell Encana shares, a move the investor says would compound the 70 per cent decline in share price experienced since Sept. 30, 2018.</p>
      <p>Encana recently announced the headquarters move as part of a reorganization that would include changing its name to Ovintiv, as well as a share consolidation.</p>
      <p>CEO Doug Suttles, a Texan who lives in Denver, says the change in corporate home is meant to help the company tap into deeper pools of U.S. passive investor capital.</p>
      <p>The changes require a shareholder vote to be held early next year.</p>
      <p>"The proposed move is contrary to Encana's best interests and reflects a profound absence of concern for the protection and enhancement of shareholder value," charges Letko Brosseau in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Further, Encana did not take or even appear to consider any steps to mitigate the adverse consequences to the company or its Canadian investors."</p>
