      <h1>Meghan Markle Named 2019’s ‘Most Powerful Fashion Influencer’</h1>

      <p><a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/prince-harry-meghan-markle-snub-queen-elizabeth-with-their-holiday-plans-340605/">Meghan Markle</a> became a fashion icon overnight when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in November 2017. And ever since then, every piece of clothing she wears pretty much sells out right away. This year, it’s clear that Markle’s fashion influence can’t be matched, as the Lyst Index has named her 2019’s most powerful fashion influencer.</p>
      <p>Last year, Markle came in third behind Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian. But she overtook the <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> stars this time around, and she was also the only member of the royal family in the top ten. Markle’s sister-in-law Kate Middleton hasn’t made the top ten since 2017 when she was number five, and this year the Duchess of Cambridge took the number 11 spot.</p>

      <p>According to <i>The Daily Mail</i>, the Lyst Index is a global fashion search platform that collects data on the biggest trends and analyzes the numbers to find out which celebrity leaves the biggest mark on the world of fashion. The Lyst Index looks at clothing sales, page views, social media mentions, and media coverage to create their list. And in 2019, Markle came out on top because anything the Duchess of Sussex wore in public sparked a 216 percent increase in online searches for similar items.</p>
      <p>Markle’s five different shirt dresses that she wore during her royal tour of South Africa led to a massive increase in searches for the style, and the Club Monaco dress she wore when she introduced Archie Harrison to Archbishop Desmond Tutu demonstrated the power of the “Meghan Effect” when it sold out in less than a day.</p>

      <p>Coming in behind Markle at number two is <i>Interstellar</i> star Timothee Chalamet. The 23-year-old seldom uses the help of a stylist to come up with his looks, including his embellished Louis Vuitton bib at the Golden Globes and his sequin hoodie at the premiere of <i>The King</i>. The hoodie led to a 192 percent increase in “men’s hoodies” searches. And, when the actor wore a suit from Haider Ackermann, there was a 806 percent increase the following week in searches for the brand.</p>
      <p>At number three is actress and singer Zendaya, and joining the list this year at number four is Billie Eilish. Rounding at the top five is rapper Cardi B. The rest of the top ten includes K-Pop star Lisa from Blackpink, Kylie Jenner, Lizzo, Harry Styles, and Emmy-winner Billy Porter.</p>
