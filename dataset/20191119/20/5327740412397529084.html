      <h1>Union to prepare for picket lines, announce new measures in transit strike escalation</h1>
      <h2>Unifor said the move comes after a ‘failure by the employer to make new offers at the bargaining table’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/katya-slepian/" target="_blank">Katya Slepian</a></address>
      <p>The union representing 5,000 Coast Mountain Bus Company workers said it will announce the “next stage” of strike action on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Tuesday morning’s announcement came as a result of what Unifor called a “failure by the employer to make new offers at the bargaining table.”</p>
      <p>The announcement will be followed by strike training for workers, including “picket line preparation.”</p>
      <p>Bus operators and maintenance workers have been undertaking job action since Nov. 1. The labour dispute began with an overtime ban for maintenance workers and a uniform ban for bus drivers on Nov 1, but last week Unifor announced its bus drivers would not take overtime on alternating days.</p>
      <p>More to come.</p>
