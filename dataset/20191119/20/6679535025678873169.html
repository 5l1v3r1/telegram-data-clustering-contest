      <p>The Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways on Tuesday informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that the draft guidelines for the setting up and operation of vehicle-scrapping centres have been prepared and uploaded on its website for public suggestions and objections.</p>
      <p>A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel was informed by the Ministry that a policy paper on the creation of an ecosystem for scrapping old vehicles and ensuring the transition into environment-friendly new vehicles, has also been circulated.</p>
      <p>According to the draft Authorised Vehicle Scrapping Facility (AVSF) guidelines, individuals, firms, societies and trusts will be allowed to set up such facilities. However, it will be subject to meeting the requisite eligibility criteria and authorisation from the authorities.</p>
      <p>The guidelines added that the authorisation will be valid for a decade and can be renewed for another 10 years.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) submitted before the Bench that a special task force is monitoring Mayapuri on a weekly basis to keep a check on any units dismantling vehicles on the roads. “The DPCC has constituted 16 teams to carry out night patrolling of industrial areas of Delhi to identify dumping and burning of any type of waste, apart from identifying industries emitting black smoke,” the DPCC submitted.</p>
