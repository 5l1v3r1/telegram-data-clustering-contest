      <p>He appeared on petition at the town’s Sheriff Court in connection with the alleged incident in October, the same month she died.</p>
      <p>Separately detectives launched a probe into Kirsty’s death after a postmortem was carried out.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Police can confirm that a 29-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a serious sexual assault of a 29-year-old woman in Ayr.”</p>
      <p>And she added on the death probe: “Our enquiries are ongoing and the death is being treated currently as unexplained.”</p>
      <p>Hose appeared on petition on 4 November. He made no plea and was granted bail.</p>
      <p>No future dates have yet been set.</p>

      <p>It’s understood Kirsty had no immediate family other than her two children after her parents and brother died.</p>
      <p>A close pal started a fundraiser to pay for her send-off - and raised a whopping £3,000.</p>
      <p>Samantha Hart wrote on JustGiving: “Kirsty was an absolute diamond and an amazing mum to her two kids who meant the world to her.”</p>
      <p>Officers made door-to-door enquiries and were seen searching her property and the street for clues <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4874874/ayrshire-mum-dead-body-dalmilling-flat/">after her death</a>.</p>
