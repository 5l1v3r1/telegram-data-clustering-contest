      <p>I knew it the moment I saw him. His perfectly round head. His cute buck tooth. Those innocent wide eyes. His smooth, porcelain-white skin. The way his polo and shorts hug his body just so.</p>
      <p>Even before I spoke to him outside of the first gym, I knew the undeniable truth: Ball Guy is good. Ball Guy is a friend. He didn’t even need to give me a Poké Ball for me to feel this way; Ball Guy’s mere existence is not only valid, but crucial in our increasingly cynical world. Ball Guy knows what he likes, and he earnestly embodies it — literally. We could all do to learn from Ball Guy.</p>

      <p>And yet, wherever I look, so-called “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20963616/pokemon-sword-shield-game-freak-lied-hashtag-nintendo-switch">Pokémon fans</a>” besmirch Ball Guy’s name.</p>
      <p>“He scares me,” cowards say. “Why does he look like that?” these poor, lost souls continue. “How did he get into my house?” they whimper with fear.</p>
      <p>Ball Guy does not owe us an explanation. Ball Guy exists in a world where grown men run around in Pikachu onesies while holding six of the same useless monsters and it’s fine. By these standards, Ball Guy is frankly a pretty normal dude. Actually, Ball Guy is a helpful pal. He’s always ready to give you a new ball when you find another gym, complete with everything you need to know to make use of it. I love Ball Guy, even if I can’t really name search him online without regretting my entire life.</p>
      <p>Ball Guy’s fandom is small, but it is pure, and that makes me happy. Thank you, Ball Guy.</p>
