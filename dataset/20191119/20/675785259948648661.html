      <h1>Next Tottenham manager odds: Jose Mourinho installed as bookmakers' favourite</h1>
      <h2>Spurs axed Mauricio Pochettino after a poor start to the season has left them languishing down in 14th in the Premier League table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:51:46+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been installed as the bookmakers’ favourite to become the next <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> manager.</p>
      <p>Spurs axed Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday after a poor start to the season has left them languishing down in 14th in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>The Argentine departs after five years in north London and having led them to the Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>Tottenham chief Daniel Levy said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change.</p>
      <p>"It is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste. Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing."</p>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Mourinho is in pole position to replace him at the helm, with the Sky Sports pundit 3/1 on to take over according to Betfair.</p>
      <p>Carlo Ancelotti is second favourite at 17/2, followed by Massimiliano Allegri (9/1).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> ’s Brendan Rodgers and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> ’s Eddie Howe (both 16/1) are also in the frame.</p>
      <p>Betfair Spokesperson, Sam Rosbottom said: “All week we have been taking a large number of big bets on Jose Mourinho to become the next Tottenham manager.</p>
      <p>“48 hours ago, odds on the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and Manchester United boss to take over from Poch were as big as 5/1, but now they are as little as to 1/3.”</p>
