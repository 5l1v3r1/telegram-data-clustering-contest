      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has dismissed Boris Johnson’s pledge to “get Brexit done” by the end of January as “nonsense”.</p>
      <p>In the opening exchanges of the TV debate hosted by ITV, the British Prime Minister warned the UK faced more “dither and delay” under a Labour government.</p>
      <p>He said a vote for the Conservatives would be a vote to finally “get Brexit done”.</p>
      <p>“If you vote for us, we have a deal that is ready to go. Approved by every one of the 635 Conservatives candidates standing at this election,” he said.</p>
      <p>“As soon as we can get that deal through Parliament, as we can in the next few weeks, we can get on with the people’s priorities.”</p>

      <p>But Mr Corbyn retorted that he could not deliver on what he was promising.</p>
      <p>“That idea that the Prime Minister Boris Johnson’ deal can be dealt with and finished by the end of January is such nonsense,” he said.</p>
      <p>“What he is proposing is a trade deal which will take at least seven years to negotiate whilst at the same time saying he will negotiate a special trade deal with the European Union.</p>
      <p>“The two things are actually incompatible.”</p>
