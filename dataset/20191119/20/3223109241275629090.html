      <h1>Daisy Ridley Says ‘Rey Is Driving Her Own Thing’ in ‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:00:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/genevieve_scarano/" target="_blank">Genevieve Scarano</a></address>
      <p>It’s the end of a saga, but fans are talking about Rey’s fate in <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/we-almost-got-the-star-wars-and-pokemon-games-we-always-wanted-1810948/"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>, which hits theaters in a month from today.</p>
      <p><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> cast, including <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/daisy-ridley-describes-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-in-4-words-1810596/">Daisy Ridley</a>, and director J.J. Abrams, spoke about the film in an <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/19/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i> interview</a>. Shockingly enough, Rey may have other motives in mind, especially when it comes to her complicated relationship with Kylo Ren.</p>

      <p>“Rey is driving her own thing,” Ridley explained. “She’s not doing what other people are telling her to do.”</p>
      <p>Adding to this mystery are Disney’s three trailers for <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>. In each, we see the Jedi apprentice fighting with First Order leader Kylo Ren on what looks like the remains of a Death Star. Also, there are shots of Rey with a red, double-bladed lightsaber. This really confusing, but do we really know who Rey is at this point?</p>

      <p>“What we set out to do was far more challenging. Everything is exponentially larger on this,” Abrams said. “The [trailers] that have come out are scratching the surface of what the movie is.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/final-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-brings-us-all-together-1808064/"><i>The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>, which also stars John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac, premieres in theaters on Dec. 20.</p>
