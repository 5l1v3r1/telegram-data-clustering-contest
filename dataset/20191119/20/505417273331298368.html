      <p>Before then, however, <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/hes-still-young-so-he-has-a-lot-to-learn-but-hes-a-good-lad/">Pochettino</a> was viewed as quite a popular manager. In his five seasons in charge, he led Spurs to four top-four finishes and also guided the club to a Champions League final appearance earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In a statement released this evening Levy explained the club’s decision.</p>
      <p>“We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the Club’s best interests.</p>
      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
