      <h1>Josh McDaniels Addresses Tom Brady’s Frustration With The Offense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:19:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Sunday afternoon, the New England Patriots exacted their revenge over the Philadelphia Eagles from their Super Bowl loss.</p>
      <p>However, even after the 17-10 win, quarterback Tom Brady and company were less-than-pleased with their play on the field. Specifically, Brady was unhappy with the play of the offense.</p>
      <p>Brady shared his “frustration” with the offense after the win.</p>
      <p>Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels responded to Brady’s comments on Tuesday. McDaniels said he doesn’t take Brady’s comments as “negative.”</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say via <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/19/josh-mcdaniels-never-views-tom-bradys-frustration-as-a-negative/">Pro Football Talk</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve been with Tom a long time and I appreciate his competitive spirit, his desire to be perfect in everything he does and with everything that our unit does. I don’t ever take that as a negative. I understand he wants to go out there and do what we all do which is to put a lot of points on the board every week.”</blockquote>
      <p>Brady’s frustrations should begin and end with himself. The 42-year-old quarterback consistently missed open throws, completing just 26-of-47 passing for 216 yards.</p>
      <p>The only offensive touchdown for the Patriots came on a touchdown pass from wide receiver Julian Edelman to fellow receiver Phillip Dorsett.</p>
      <p>Next up for the Patriots is a home game against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
