      <p>Earlier this month, the couple waived their right to appear in federal court in Boston to answer to the latest counts.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors <a href="https://apnews.com/a26f376c915d44bd9b5aa1c7e8f7a717">added the bribery charge</a> for 11 parents who previously pleaded not guilty in the case. Another 19 parents have pleaded guilty or agreed to do so.</p>
      <p>Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the <a href="https://twitter.com/USC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">University of Southern California</a> as fake athletic recruits. Their daughters no longer attend USC.</p>
      <p>The couple previously <a href="https://apnews.com/bfabb6afeb40408481bbb771b6577e2a">pleaded not guilty</a> to fraud and money laundering.</p>
