      <p>Pochettino took over at Spurs in May 2014, 18 months prior to Klopp’s Anfield, but was dismissed by the London side after a poor start to the season and with reports of dressing room unrest.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/tottenham">Tottenham</a> statement said: “We were extremely reluctant to make this change.</p>
      <p>“It is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste. Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls on the board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the club’s best interests.”</p>
      <p>This arrives five months after Klopp and Pochettino met in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> final in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Klopp enters the top-five longest-serving managers in England, behind only Gareth Ainsworth (Wycombe), Eddie Howe (<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>), Sean Dyche (<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/burnley">Burnley</a>) and John Coleman (Accrington Stanley).</p>
      <p>One of those, Howe, is among the names being linked with taking over at White Hart Lane; along with the likes of Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Julian Nagelsmann.</p>
      <p>Stability at Anfield is now assumed, after a decade of unrest under previous ownership and four managers in five years in the Reds’ dugout.</p>
