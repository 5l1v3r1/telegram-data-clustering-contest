      <p>It was another successful ToastyToes campaign in Waterloo Region.</p>
      <p>The founder of the campaign says 40,500 pairs of socks were collected from October 10 to November 10, the most the campaign has ever brought it.</p>
      <p>And since the campaign got its start, close to 127,000 pairs of socks have been donated.</p>
      <p>Sharon Gilroy-Dreher launched the campaign in 2013 in memory of her mother, who always had cold feet and loved giving socks to people.</p>
