      <p>“Let It Go?” Honey, Lea Michele doesn’t know the meaning of the term. More like “Hold Onto Everything With an Osprey-Like Vice Grip,” she always says! And so, not to be outdone by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq5I53yG6f8">new Christmas release</a> by Mama Who Bore Her (on <i>Glee</i>) Idina Menzel, Michele has dropped the music video for her new holiday classic, “Christmas in New York.” The track has the sort of Broadway-ready rhythm that makes you want to throw up jazz hands like <a href="https://youtu.be/93-EXp5PbOA">Harry Styles backing Baby Faye</a>, and has beautiful lyrics like “Rockettes are warming up their kicks / Radio City sold out all of their tick-ets.” The video starts out like a Macy’s commercial, with extras toting shopping bags, and Michele literally singing <i>about </i>Macy’s, until she feels her Carrie Bradshaw fantasy, hailing a yellow taxi “<i>straight </i>to Central Park!” in a big festive party dress. Michele may not be on Broadway — based on the video’s liberal use of stock footage, she may not even be within 200 miles of the NYC metro area — but it’s festive, peppy, and not nearly as uncomfortable as her breathy, sensual rendition of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyyqlsWWw9s">Do You Want to Build a Snowman?</a>”</p>
      <p>P.S. Are we as a society just going to let Idina Menzel get away with passing “Seasons of Love” off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCwMNvFLF4U">as a Christmas carol</a> on her new album, <i>Christmas: A Season of Love? </i>That’s a carol for (a) graduations, (b) memorial services, and (c) my bat mitzvah slideshow <i>only!</i></p>
