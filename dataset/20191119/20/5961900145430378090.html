      <h1>I Experienced All Five Stages Of Grief Watching Today’s New ‘Cats’ Trailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:54:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author">By David Adams</a></address>
      <p>I experienced all five stages of grief watching the latest <i>Cats</i> trailer. First came the denial and isolation, which set in right as <b>Dame Judi Dench</b>-cat intoned “Tonight is a magical night, where I choose the cat that deserves a new life.” No, it’s not even 7.30am on a Wednesday morning, and I am alone, under harsh fluorescents, writing about a CGI war crime. But go off.</p>
      <p>Then the anger. That set in halfway between seeing <b>Idris Elba</b>-cat and <b>Rebel Wilson</b>-cat. It is a simple emotion which does not bear further explanation, nor justification. It just is.</p>
      <p>“But what if <i>Cats</i> could be good, in an self-hating ironic way?” I thought to myself, watching three cats suffer myxomatosis around the 30-second mark. Could I drag a handful of friends to the local cineplex, hand some dinero to the kind kiosk attendant, and perchance have a mirthful evening? <i>Hmmm?</i></p>

      <p>That bargaining gave way to depression, coincidentally at the precise moment <b>James Corden</b>-cat emerged. Then I accepted it: <i>Cats</i> is certainly going to be a movie for someone, but it’s probably not the movie for me. And that’s fine. Everything is fine! Normal morning, normal movie.</p>
      <p>Anyway, here it is. <i>Cats</i> hits Australian cinema screens on Boxing Day.</p>
