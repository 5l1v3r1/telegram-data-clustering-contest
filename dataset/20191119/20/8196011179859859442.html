      <p>While perusing some newspapers last weekend I came across an advertisement for Later Life Mortgages — or LLMs — in a British publication.</p>
      <p>These do not, to my, knowledge exist in Ireland but have become a major source of lending in the UK.</p>
      <p>It is, perhaps, time to consider a version of this to assist the transfer of inter-generational wealth in Ireland and assist the creation of equity in the housing market.</p>
      <p>Later Life Mortgages are loans made to house owners who are above 55 years of age.</p>
      <p>These are offered an opportunity to take out a mortgage on an interest-only or interest-plus capital basis.</p>
      <p>The loan is fully repaid when the property is sold, either before or after the owners have passed away or moved in to long-term care.</p>
      <p>That may sound like a macabre scenario but consider the alternative.</p>
      <p>A narrative has developed which suggests older couples or parents should “downsize” to free up cash for their children.</p>
      <p>The thinking goes that these older people are rambling around big houses when they could comfortably live in smaller units.</p>
      <p>To me, this attitude is another example of ageism and a level of patronising that ought to be pushed back.</p>
      <p>Firstly, these house owners have funded the mortgages attached to the houses over an extended period while they worked.</p>
      <p>These mortgages have been fully repaid faithfully and left an asset debt free.</p>
      <p>That, alone, deserves some credit.</p>
      <p>Second, the emotional attachment of a couple or parent to a house which they lived in for decades and reared a family in cannot be underestimated.</p>
      <p>Memories of life in these houses can be powerful and positive factors in a person’s life.</p>
      <p>There may also be aspects of a house, such as a mature garden, that is of invaluable benefit to anyone who has invested many years in its development.</p>
      <p>For these reasons we should appreciate that many people have limited interest in downsizing and walking away from a property and neighbourhood that means a lot more to them than money.</p>
      <p>However, it is an inescapable fact that many older couples and individuals live in highly valued properties that have no borrowing attached to them.</p>
      <p>This is the quintessential example of being asset rich and relatively cash poor.</p>
      <p>In a market where house prices are high in absolute terms, and Central Bank rules require material deposits, the value of an unencumbered house is obvious.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we need to think more imaginatively about how to free up some equity.</p>
      <p>This is where Later Life Mortgages (LLMs) come in.</p>
      <p>The first priority with such a product, in an Irish context, is to minimise risk of default on the mortgage.</p>
      <p>To do this, it would be a good idea to start with a cap on the percentage of the house value that can be subject to a LLM.</p>
      <p>Let’s assume a 50% cap meaning the house price would have to halve before the debt equalled the value of the property.</p>
      <p>Second, only make LLMs available to borrowers who have proven records in repaying mortgages during their working lives.</p>
      <p>These borrowers have a proven ability to manage and repay debt.</p>
      <p>Take an example that can best illustrate how an LLM might work. Imagine a house with a value of €500,000. Assume an LLM is made available for 50%.</p>
      <p>That provides €250,000 to the owner which he or she can use for a multitude of purposes.</p>
      <p>Some may give it to their children as deposits for their own properties.</p>
      <p>It will require some imagination and leadership in the banking system to bring forward LLMs in Ireland.</p>
      <p>An analysis in the UK shows they are growing in popularity at a rapid pace.</p>
      <p>It is surely only a matter of time before they surface via credible lending institutions here.</p>
