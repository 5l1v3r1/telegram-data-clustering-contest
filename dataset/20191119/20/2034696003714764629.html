      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-big-moon">The Big Moon</a> have released another new track from their upcoming second album – listen to ‘Take A Piece’ below.</p>
      <p>The London four-piece made their return over the summer with <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/big-moon-new-single-easy-phoebe-waller-bridge-inspired-new-album-2534919">comeback single ‘It’s Easy Then</a>‘, which was followed by ‘Your Light’. Both tracks will feature on their <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-big-moon-share-details-of-new-album-walking-like-we-do-and-release-single-your-light-2546560">2020 record ‘Walking Like We Do</a>’.</p>

      <p>Appearing on Annie Mac’s BBC Radio 1 show earlier this evening (November 19), the band offered up another glimpse of LP2. Lead vocalist Juliette Jackson wrote in a press release that ‘Take A Piece’ was inspired by the challenging lifestyle of a huge pop figure. </p>
      <p>“I’d just watched a documentary about this pop star and seen how insane their life was and their intense relationship with their fans, and was blown away by how much of themselves they’d had to give up to have the life they had,” she said of the lyrics’ meaning. </p>

      <p>“It was a bit of a turning point in the writing process… like sometimes you have to pretend to be someone else to change things up and say things in ways you didn’t know you could.”</p>
      <p>Jackson went on to explain the band were initially unsure about exploring this “unfamiliar ground” of pop music. “And when we finally recorded it we were like gahhh what have we made?” she said. “Is this a Big Moon song? Can we be this self-indulgent? BUT WHY THE HELL NOT?”</p>
      <p>Continuing with this theme, the official ‘Take A Piece’ clip sees The Big Moon take on the style of iconic ’90s videos, with tongue-in-cheek nods to <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/east-17">East 17</a>‘s ‘Stay Another Day’, double denim-loving B*Witched, and more. </p>
      <p>The band gave the track a live airing during <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/the-big-moon-live-review-walking-like-we-do-new-songs-why-dont-think-wave-take-a-piece">their intimate show at The Lexington in London</a> last month. Three more unheard tracks – ‘Why’, ‘Waves’ and ‘Don’t Think’ – were also performed on the night.</p>
      <p>The Big Moon will head out on a UK headline tour in February next year, following the release of  ‘Walking Like We Do’ on January 10. See the full schedule below.</p>
