      <h1>Google re-launches the “Close other tabs” feature in Chrome 78 stable update</h1>

      <p>“Close other tabs” is a feature in Chrome that lets you dismiss all your open tabs except for the current one you are viewing. It’s a fairly simple process — all you need to do is right-click on the tab and then click on the “Close other tabs” option in the right-click menu.</p>
      <p>The feature was recently pulled by Google, but <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-chrome-close-other-tabs-option-back/">the company later brought it back in the Chrome Canary channel</a> on users’ requests. Now, Google has added the “Close other tabs” option in the right-click menu of Chrome 78 stable update too. This feature is now available to everyone running the Chrome 78.0.3904.0.108 stable update.</p>

      <p>In other words, if you’re on Chrome 78 stable, you’ll be able to dismiss all your open tabs except for the current one you are viewing simply by right-clicking on a tab.</p>
      <p>Apart from that, Google also added five security fixes in the Chrome 78 stable update. These security fixes are very important as they ensure protection from online security threats.</p>
      <p>To update to the Chrome 78.0.3904.0.108 stable, launch Chrome and then click on the help menu and check for updates.</p>
