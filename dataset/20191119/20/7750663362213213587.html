      <p>Ross took his former St Mirren captain with him when he made his move to the Stadium of Light 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>But Potter remained behind on Wearside when Ross was axed by the Black Cats six weeks ago.</p>
      <p>However, the Sky Bet League One outfit have allowed Potter to return north of the border to join Ross in Leith.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's a real honour to be joining Jack at Hibernian.</p>
      <p>"From our own playing and coaching careers in Scotland it's obviously a club we know all about and we'll do whatever it takes – alongside the players and staff – to be successful.</p>
      <p>"We're all just looking forward to Motherwell coming to Easter Road on Saturday now."</p>
