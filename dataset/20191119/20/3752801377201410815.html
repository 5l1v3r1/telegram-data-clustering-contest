      <h1>From apathy to outrage - the rise against sexist violence in SA</h1>

      <p>Eventually, it all became too much. Apathy became transformed into outrage. And little by little, a national campaign for change took hold.</p>
      <p>For years, the country's awful reputation for the murder and rape of women had gone unchallenged by many of its citizens.</p>
      <p>Consider this: Every three hours, a woman in South Africa is killed, a rate that is five times the world average. Half of all women murder victims are killed by men with whom they had a close relationship. And each day, more than a hundred women are raped - an estimate as horrifying as it is conservative, experts say.</p>
      <p>But the veil of indifference to this suffering was ripped aside last August, after the death of a 19-year-old student.</p>
      <p>Her killer, a post office employee, lured Cape Town university student Uyinene Mrwetyana to his workplace and raped her before bludgeoning her to death with a measuring scale.</p>
      <p>He then dumped her body in a shallow hole and burnt it.</p>
      <p>Grief, then anger, ensued.</p>
      <p>"The murder of Uyinene sparked much of the conversation we are seeing," said Cape Town student activist Zimasa Mpemnyama.</p>
      <p>The killing was a turning point "regarding our collective responsibility to end violence, particularly against women", says the country's former ombudswoman, Thuli Madonsela.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Protests</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hashtags #AmInext and #MenAreTrash became the rallying point to voice anger about violence against women. From Twitter accounts came digital support groups for survivors, with some even naming their alleged abusers.</p>
      <p>Thousands took part in rallies. Blood-stained sheets and clothing were laid out in front of Johannesburg's stock exchange to demand for more support from businesses and banks.</p>
      <p>On October 14, police, previously accused of indifferent handling of sexual assault cases, marched in their hundreds in the capital Pretoria to protest at violence against women.</p>
      <p>Deputy National Commissioner Bonang Mgwenya called it a "state of emergency".</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, visited a site dedicated to Mrwetyana and tied a yellow ribbon in solidarity with all victims of gender-based violence and femicide.</p>
      <p>In a hard-hitting speech to parliament, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared the country as one of "the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman".</p>
      <p>He named gender-based violence a "national crisis" and vowed to crack down on perpetrators. His Cabinet has allocated R1.6bn for a six-month plan.</p>
      <p>Mrwetyana's murderer was last week given a record three life sentences after an unusually fast-tracked trial and conviction in a country where the legal system is sluggish and inefficient.</p>
      <p>The SABC two weeks ago launched a television talk show, <i>The Orange Couch</i>, where it invites survivors to share their stories and to "inspire" women in tricky situations "to find their own strength to break the chains" of dangerous relationships.</p>
      <p>Miss South Africa, Zozibini Tunzi, has invited men to send her messages of love for women.</p>
      <p>She will then incorporate the messages in ribbons as part of her costume for the upcoming Miss Universe pageant, the goal being to encourage "conversation around gender-based violence".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Seismic shift</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We are starting to see also a very vocal new generation of activists who are expressing anger in ways that are distinct for this time," Pumla Gqola, an academic and author of <i>Rape: A South African Nightmare</i> told AFP.</p>
      <p>Catherine Burns, a history professor at the University of Pretoria, said: "The problem has been with us for a while but there is a definite shift in response, particularly from young women."</p>
      <p>"You see this shift... in the fear and the caution of some men in public, the slightly different way they feel they have to speak," added Burns.</p>
      <p>Some wonder how far the rise against sexist violence will last in a country facing huge economic and social ills.</p>
      <p>"There are moments of highs when everyone talks about it," Mpemnyama said.</p>
      <p>"But there are also moments of lows where people don't, because other countless problems... also preoccupy people's minds."</p>
      <p>Others, though, feel the anti-violence sentiment is here to stay.</p>
      <p>"Because it's across so many sectors, it's hard for me to see that it can just melt back into the status quo of five years ago," Burns said.</p>
      <p>"We are seeing this now... because of an impatience," Gqola said.</p>
      <p>An abuse survivor and single mother of one boy told AFP that increased media coverage had encouraged many survivors to speak out.</p>
      <p>Many had seen or experienced terrible abuse, and had had to carry that anger with them all their lives.</p>
      <p>This was now changing.</p>
      <p>"They are now opening up," she said.</p>
