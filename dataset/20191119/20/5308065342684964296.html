      <p>Bloomberg today reports that billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Financial Services Group may apply for a virtual banking license in Singapore.</p>
      <p>“We are actively looking into this opportunity,“ Ant Financial told Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is offering as many as five digital banking permits to non-banks and Jack Ma’s company may become yet another heavyweight contender to the race.</p>
      <p>Singapore is trying to to open up the industry to new competitors that would compete with traditional banking groups such as DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.</p>

      <p>There are up to two licenses for grabs for a full digital bank. One is a service requiring S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in capital and local control.</p>
      <p>The other would be for wholesale banks, which foreign firms can run and the capital threshold is S$100 million,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/ant-financial-may-join-race-for-singapore-virtual-bank-licenses"> says Bloomberg. </a></p>
      <p>On Nov 7, Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director Ravi Menon said the country wants to become a regional hub for tech firms with advance data expertise. In this respect, Singapore is opening the doors virtual banks.</p>
      <p>Monetary Authority of Singapore in Oct announced it is issuing 5 licenses by 2020. During the announcement, Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Chairman of MAS said the regulator is committed to allowing for greater competition that would spur innovation in finance.</p>
      <p>He also stressed that Singapore “must retain strong local anchor and trust in the banking system.” -/TISG</p>
