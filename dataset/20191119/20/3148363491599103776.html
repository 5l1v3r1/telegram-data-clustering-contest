      <h1>Vindman Refuses to Call Biden's Threat to Withhold Aid ‘Wrong’</h1>
      <h2>The Democrats’ star impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman refused to characterize former Vice President Joe Biden’s (D) threat — to withhold aid from Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings — as “wrong,” admitting that he viewed the video showing Biden bragging about his threat but refraining from condemning it.</h2>

      <p>During his line of questioning, Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) noted that Vindman’s concerns of the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky were based on “moral, ethical, and policy differences” rather than legal concerns.</p>
      <p>“So your concerns regarding this phone call were not legal. They were based on moral, ethical, and policy differences. … To use your word. You said this was wrong. Not illegal, but wrong,” he said, asking Vindman if he considered Biden’s actions “wrong” as well.</p>
      <p>“There are dozens of corrupt nations in the world. Hundreds of corrupt government officials. Exactly one time did a vice president go to a nation and demand the specific firing of one individual and give a six-hour time limit and withhold or threaten to withhold a billion dollars in aid if not,” Stewart said, referencing the video of Biden <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/09/27/flashback_2018_joe_biden_brags_at_cfr_meeting_about_withholding_aid_to_ukraine_to_force_firing_of_prosecutor.html">bragging</a> about his threat during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations last year.</p>
      <p>“It was the one individual who was investigating a company who was paying his son. So I’ll ask you, was that also wrong?” Stewart asked.</p>
      <p>“I frankly don’t have any firsthand knowledge of that,” Vindman began.</p>
      <p>“Did you not see the video?” Stewart asked.</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen the video,” Vindman admitted.</p>
      <p>“That’s all I’ve described is the video. Everything I just said to you is in the video. Was that wrong as well?” Stewart asked again.</p>
      <p>“Congressman, this is something I actually participated in,” Vindman began, with Stewart adding, “Well I think the American people can make a judgment.”</p>
      <p>“The time of the gentleman has expired,” Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said, giving Vindman an option to answer the question.</p>
      <p>Once again, Vindman refused to describe Biden’s action as “wrong.”</p>
      <p>“I frankly don’t know any — that much more about that particular incident,” he said. “I saw the snippet of the video, but I don’t know if I could make a judgment off of that.”</p>
      <p>The exchange centered around a video featuring Biden’s braggadocious recount of threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid from Ukraine unless officials fired the prosecutor investigating Burisma, where Hunter Biden was making tens of thousands per month despite a stunning lack of qualifications for such a position on the board:</p>

      <p>“And so I got Ukraine. And I remember going over, convincing our team, our leaders to—convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev,” Biden said on January 23, 2018.</p>
      <p>Biden <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/09/27/flashback_2018_joe_biden_brags_at_cfr_meeting_about_withholding_aid_to_ukraine_to_force_firing_of_prosecutor.html">continued</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t. So they said they had—they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to—or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said—I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.</blockquote>
      <p>“Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,” Biden bragged.</p>
