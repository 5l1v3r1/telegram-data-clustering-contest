      <h1>Radisson Hotel expanding to Cebu, Bacolod</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Othel V. Campos</a></address>
      <p>The Radisson Hotel Group is expanding its presence in the Philippines with the development of two more hotels in Mandaue City, Cebu and Bacolod City, Negros Occidental.</p>
      <p>Once completed, the two hotels will bring the group’s total inventory to 1,390 rooms by 2022.</p>
      <p>Radisson Hotel vice president for operations in Southeast Asia and Pacific Andre de Jong said the expansion would comprise the first part of a two-phase, five-year transformational plan under the so-called “Destination 2022” program.</p>
      <p>The plan seeks to triple the business in the region, with the Philippines playing a significant part on the expansion.</p>
      <p>“We are on track on achieving that plan for the region. The Philippines is an important player in a sense that it comes next to China and India in terms of number of hotels,” de Jong said.</p>
      <p>The group will be opening Park Inn by Radisson in Bacolod City in 2020 and the Radisson RED Mandaue by 2022.</p>
      <p>Together, these two new assets will add 390 to the existing 1,100 rooms from five properties operated by the Radisson Group in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>The group is also considering expanding to secondary and tertiary locations outside the bustling and cramped metropolis in Metro Manila.  These include sites like Baguio and other locations frequented by tourists.</p>
      <p>Radisson Hotel introduced two of its seven brands in the Philippines through the upscale Radisson Blu Cebu and the contemporary midscale Park Inn by Radisson in Clark, Davao, Iloilo and North EDSA.</p>
      <p>The opening of the Radisson Red Mandaue marks the entry of the Radisson Red brand in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Radisson operates efficiently on aspiring markets with potential high growth like the Philippines as it aligns development with the growth of the tourism and travel sector.</p>
      <p>De Jong said that high trajectory of travel growth fits well with its criteria for expansion, as arrival traffic in the country was projected to reach 8.2 million in 2019, up by 15.5 percent from 7.1 million tourists in 2018.</p>
      <p>“The Philippines is a highly attractive market with a large population, rising affluence and a strong tourism sector. Radisson Hotel has a proven track record in operational excellence and providing global hospitality services that exceed our guests’ expectations. I am confident that we will continue to leverage opportunities to build up and deliver on our brand promises,” De Jong said.</p>
      <p>The group maintains 700 employees working in all five Radisson hotels and will add 300 more jobs as the two new hotels come on stream.</p>
