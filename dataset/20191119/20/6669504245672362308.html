      <p>Keremeos RCMP were called to perform a rather unusual task earlier this month.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 7 around 6 p.m., Keremeos RCMP Const. Matthew Groen was called by a member of the public to assist after a young moose was discovered with its leg caught in a barb-wire fence along Highway 3A, north of Ollala, according to an RCMP media release.</p>
      <p>Bystanders told the officer they believed the young moose’s mother was nearby and reluctant to move along. The officer checked out the situation before returning to the Keremeos detachment for some bolt cutters which he was able to use to free the young animal.</p>
      <p>The moose was last seen running back into the brush.</p>
      <p>“Officers working in remote detachments often have to use their ingenuity to problem solve unique situations on their own,” police spokesperson Const. James Grandy said in the release.</p>
      <p>He said stories such as these are the “good news stories the public rarely hears about.”</p>
