      <h1>'Star Wars' actor Adam Driver reveals one item he took home from set after filming</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:44:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author">Julius Young</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/star-wars-actor-adam-driver-credits-the-military-for-acting-success-it-gives-you-a-lot-of-confidence">Adam Driver</a> is spilling the beans on what items he had to lift from the “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/star-wars">Star Wars”</a> set after filming wrapped on the final <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">movie</a>, “The Rise of Skywalker.”</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old actor appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Monday and when asked by the witty host, “What’s it like to hang up your lightsaber?” the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/adam-driver-says-star-wars-character-kylo-ren-isnt-evil-hes-just-confident-hes-right">Kylo Ren</a> performer admitted he never really gave up his coveted fictional weapon.</p>
      <p>"I also have it, so I literally hung it up. It's in a box, but it's hung in the box," Driver revealed to the audience. The “BlacKkKlansman” actor noted that he sought permission from director <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/star-wars-episode-ix-to-be-directed-written-by-j-j-abrams">J.J. Abrams</a> to harbor some keepsakes of his own from his time donning the Kylo Ren cape, adding, "I took a lot of stuff this last time. I have the whole costume."</p>

      <p>In discussing the culmination of the Abrams-driven film, Driver marveled at the story arc created by the filmmaker and screenwriter Chris Terrio, providing an interesting context to the level of difficulty the pair took on.</p>

      <p>"[Abrams] had a really tall order not just to wrap up three movies, but nine of them,” Driver explained. “And I think what he and Chris Terrio came up with, I have to say, is pretty unique and rare."</p>
