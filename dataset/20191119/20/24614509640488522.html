      <p><b>Kohl’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/kss-stock-quote/"><b><u>KSS</u></b></a>) earnings for the retail company’s <a href="https://corporate.kohls.com/news/archive-/2019/november/kohl-s-corporation-reports-financial-results">third quarter of 2019</a> have KSS stock falling hard on Tuesday. This is due to its Non-GAAP EPS of 74 cents, which is well below Wall Street’s estimate of 86 cents. Revenue of $4.63 billion beats out analysts’ estimates of $4.40 billion, but couldn’t save KSS stock.</p>

      <p>Here’s a more in-depth look at the Q3 Kohl’s earnings report.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are down 24.49% YoY from 98 cents.</li>
        <li>Revenue is sitting at roughly the same levels as it was in the third quarter of 2018.</li>
        <li>Operating income of $204 million is 20.93% worse than the $258 million in the same period of the year prior.</li>
        <li>The Kohl’s earnings report also has net income for the quarter coming in at $123 million.</li>
        <li>That’s a 23.60% decline from KSS’ net income of $161 million in the third quarter of the previous year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Michelle Gass, CEO of Kohl’s, doesn’t offer much in the way of helpful insight to holders of KKS stock.</p>
      <blockquote>“We are pleased to report that our business returned to growth during the third quarter, with a comparable sales increase of 0.4%. The quarter started off positive in August with another successful back-to-school season and ended strong in October.”</blockquote>
      <p>The Kohl’s earnings report also includes a guidance update for 2019. KSS now expects adjusted per-share earnings to range from $4.75 to $4.95. The previous outlook was between $5.15 and $5.45. This is bad news for KSS stock with its high EPS guidance below Wall Street’s estimate of $5.19 for 2019.</p>
      <p>KSS stock was down 19.06% as of Tuesday afternoon.</p>
