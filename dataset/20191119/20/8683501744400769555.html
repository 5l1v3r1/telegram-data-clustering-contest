      <p>Although the stars of the <i>Harry Potter</i> film franchise have gone on to star in films and TV shows outside of the Wizarding World, their connection to that hugely popular property, which for many represented their first introduction to audiences, makes a potential return to the franchise an evergreen proposition. As such, the <i>Harry Potter</i> stars always get asked if they would reprise their roles onscreen, including Tom Felton. So would Tom Felton return as Draco Malfoy? Here’s what he said:</p>
      <blockquote>Yeah, I'm endlessly proud and affectionate of young Draco, so any chance to reprise that role would be great.'</blockquote>
      <p>You hear that Warner Bros.? If you send an owl, Draco Malfoy will hop on the next available broom, take the Hogwarts Express, grab a portkey or use some floo powder and he’ll be there. Tom Felton would definitely return to the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise as <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456055/the-time-harry-potters-tom-felton-tried-to-convert-his-co-star-to-slytherin?pv=search">the Slytherin</a> Draco Malfoy should the opportunity present itself.</p>
      <p>When actors who have played iconic roles in popular franchises are asked about returning, they are often grateful but reluctant or wishy washy on the topic, but not Tom Felton. Although he’s not campaigning for a sequel film or a Draco Malfoy spinoff or TV series or anything like that, he made it clear that he would relish the opportunity to reprise the role that introduced him to audiences around the world.</p>
      <p>Tom Felton seems to have a lot of love for Draco that drives his willingness to return to the character. As he told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7687295/Tom-Felton-EXC-Harry-Potter-star-praises-Emma-Watson-says-hed-call-self-partnered.html">MailOnline</a>, he is proud and affectionate of Draco Malfoy and that’s why he would be on board should anyone ask him to go back to Hogwarts one more time.</p>
      <p>The actor, who is surely asked this question quite often, has expressed how much he’d love to return to the Wizarding World in the past, as has co-star and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475032/harry-potters-rupert-grint-and-tom-felton-are-down-to-return-to-the-franchise?pv=search">onscreen enemy Rupert Grint</a>, but whether that opportunity will ever arise is another question entirely.</p>
      <p>The most obvious way for any sort of <i>Harry Potter</i> reunion on the big screen would be <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467137/why-isnt-there-a-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-movie-in-the-works-yet?pv=search">a feature film adaptation of <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i></a>. That play takes place <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Where-Draco-Malfoy-Now-According-J-K-Rowling-69076.html?pv=search">19 years after</a> <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</i> (the same time period as that film’s epilogue) which came out in 2011. So that possibility remains good for another decade or more in terms of the ages of the actors matching the ages of the characters.</p>
      <p>However, Tom Felton <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484460/harry-potter-actor-tom-felton-doesnt-think-the-cast-will-reunite-for-a-cursed-child-movie?pv=search">doesn’t think the cast will be reuniting</a> for a <i>Cursed Child</i> adaptation. Despite the ever-present question, Tom thinks that the story that needed to be told was told and for her part J.K. Rowling has given no real indication that such a film will ever happen.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the speculation persists and given <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484585/fantastic-beasts-3-are-more-dumbledore-and-hogwarts-what-the-sequel-needs?pv=search">the struggles</a> of the <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> spinoff franchise, one has to wonder if some other attempt to reproduce <i>Harry Potter</i>’s success could be in our futures, be it a <i>Cursed Child</i> adaptation, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466815/daniel-radcliffe-thinks-a-harry-potter-reboot-is-inevitable">a full reboot</a> or <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2458390/7-harry-potter-spinoffs-wed-love-to-see?pv=search">something else entirely</a>. If so, and they need a Draco Malfoy, it seems that they can count on Tom Felton.</p>
      <p>The next Wizarding World film will be <i>Fantastic Beasts 3</i>, scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 12, 2021.
