      <h2>A teenage girl told a court that rape-accused Joseph McCann told her she was 'going to Europe tomorrow' during the sustained sexual attack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:14:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Pennink</a></address>
      <p>Rape-accused Joseph McCann was branded "pure evil" as a teenager described how <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/serial-rapist-held-family-hostage-20876320">she and her little brother were abused</a> at knifepoint.</p>
      <p>McCann 34, allegedly tricked his way into a family home in Greater Manchester on May 5.</p>
      <p>He tied up a mother with hair straighteners and molested her children, aged 17 and 11, saying: "If you move, I will kill your kids," the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old girl told how she feared becoming McCann's "sex slave" before she jumped out of a first-floor window and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/serial-rapist-held-family-hostage-20876320">limped to a relative's house.</a></p>
      <p>In a video-taped <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> interview played in court, the teenager described how her attacker had initially grabbed her, put his hand over her mouth and told her to "shut up".</p>

      <p>She said: "I managed to wriggle out of it. He pulled me down onto the floor. That's when he must have knocked me out. His knife must have cut me in a few places.</p>
      <p>"I was shouting 'mum, mum, mum', but at this point he had the knife.</p>
      <p>"My mum was like 'what are you doing?', trying to stop him."</p>
      <p>McCann allegedly tied up the mother for being "gobby" and ordered her not to move.</p>
      <p>The teenager claims he took cocaine and swigged vodka before repeatedly sexually assaulting her and her brother.</p>
      <p>She said: "When I did not do what he said he kept putting the knife up to me.</p>
      <p>"In my head I was trying to think of alternative ways of trying to get out of this situation.</p>

      <p>"I could not do anything about it. Even in the shower, he took the knife with him everywhere he went.</p>
      <p>"He kept brushing it on my skin. That's more like an 'I'm in charge' thing.</p>
      <p>She went on: "I mentioned my brother was 11 and he said 'shit I didn't know that, how old are you?' I said 17.</p>
      <p>"He said me: 'you are going to Europe tomorrow, you are mine'.</p>
      <p>"At this point my life flashed before my eyes. I thought of marriage and everything.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to be his sex slave. I thought, I'm not having this."</p>
      <p>She added: "We kept being held hostage, being abused at knifepoint. It's scary. It's awful."</p>
      <p>The court has heard how the girl fractured her heel when she jumped out of a window naked to escape.</p>
      <p>McCann, from Harrow, west London, denies 37 charges relating to 11 women and children.</p>
