      <h1>Dallas, Tulsa make debut on PETA’s list of ‘most vegan-friendly’ cities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:31:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:31</time> by <a rel="author">Alexandra Deabler, Fox News</a></address>
      <p>Looks like it’s getting easier to be a vegan in the heartland.</p>
      <p>Dallas has made its debut on PETA’s “Most Vegan-Friendly Cities” list, earning the No. 7 spot on the animal rights organization’s 2019 <a href="https://headlines.peta.org/vegan-friendly-cities-2019-top-ten/">top 10 list.</a></p>
      <p>This isn’t the first city from the Lone Star State – which produces the <a href="https://www.ncba.org/beefindustrystatistics.aspx">most beef cattle in the US</a> – that has made it to one of PETA’s yearly lists, as Austin has repeatedly been featured. But it is the first time major urban hub Dallas has landed a spot.</p>
      <p>The city, which is known for its steakhouses, is reportedly home to a burgeoning vegan scene.</p>
      <p>“From tacos and tamales to a Tofurky Italian Sausage Stack, Big D boasts one of the biggest vegan dining scenes around,” says PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman.</p>
      <p>“The number of American vegans grew by 600 percent in just three years and the cities on PETA’s list are meeting the skyrocketing demand for animal-friendly fare.”</p>

      <p>Dallas was not the only city to make its debut on the 2019 list. Orlando, Fla. and Tulsa, Okla., were both first-timers as well, earning the No. 6 and No. 10 spot, respectively. It was also the first time any city in Oklahoma has made it on the list.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, West Coast cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., topped the list (in first, second and fourth, respectively), while Detroit was featured for the second year in a row (at No. 5).</p>
      <p>New York City also earned its No. 3 spot with restaurants like Modern Love Brooklyn, which serves up vegan chicken and waffles and Rips Malt Shop, which offers coconut cream and cashew ice cream.</p>
      <p>PETA also confirmed that its “Lettuce Lad and Lady” helped San Francisco celebrate taking the top spot, via a ride on the <a href="https://headlines.peta.org/vegan-friendly-cities-2019-top-ten/">city’s cable cars.</a></p>
