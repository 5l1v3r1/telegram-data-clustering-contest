        <b>The Ant half of TV hosting duo Ant and Dec has shown off his forearm tattoos on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>, with fans spotting what seemed to be new ink on the presenter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Viewers could see that Ant has an arrow on his right forearm, a large rose on his left forearm and another small tattoo of three stars near his left wrist.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we know about what his ink might mean…</p>
      <h3>Ant McPartlin’s tattoos explained</h3>
      <p>While Ant, 43, has yet to share the meaning behind all his tattoos, that hasn’t stopped Twitter users from speculating as to what his newer ones mean, with one person saying: ‘Ant on im a celeb has a mental health awareness tattoo on his arm. [sic]’</p>
      <p>Another fan wrote: ‘That tattoo on Ant’s arm says ‘clean 1 year’’.</p>

      <p>Ant previously told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/8235284/ant-mcpartlin-drink-drive-crash-mum-fears/">The Sun</a> that the arrow has a ‘personal meaning but it’s very positive’.</p>

      <p>In addition to the newer tattoos, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/23/ant-mcpartlin-reveals-alcoholics-anonymous-symbol-tattooed-inside-wrist-7751005/">Ant has something similar to the Alcoholics Anonymous symbol</a> on his left wrist. On his right wrist, he’s got ‘S&amp;H’ – it’s not clear what the ‘H’ stands for, but the ‘S’ is for ‘sober’ according to The Sun.</p>

      <p>The AA symbol, which takes the shape of a triangle in the middle of a circle, is said to represent the three sides of addiction: physical, mental and spiritual, along with the three cures of it: unity, recovery and service.</p>
      <p>On the subject of this tattoo, Ant said: ‘It means a great deal to me. The tattoo is based on the symbol but is not exactly the same.</p>
      <p>‘It’s more about beliefs and principles and where your mind is at in terms of love and being of good service to other humans, moving forward positively. It’s about how I am and how I will live my life in a good way.’</p>

      <p>I’m A Celebrity has been hosted by Ant and Dec every season except the 18th last year.</p>
      <p>Instead, Declan Donnelly was joined by Holly Willoughby, as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/19/why-is-ant-mcpartlin-not-presenting-im-a-celebrity-this-year-8154870/">Ant took time off from appearing on TV</a> to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/22/what-tv-shows-did-ant-mcpartlin-work-on-in-2018-to-qualify-for-a-national-television-award-8375290/">spend time in rehab</a> after he faced drink-driving charges in the spring.</p>
      <p>He issued a statement at the time saying: ‘My recovery is going very well and for that to continue having spoken to Dec and ITV, I have made the decision to take the rest of the year off.</p>

      <p>‘I’d like to thank both Dec and ITV for their continued support and I look forward to getting back to work in the new year.’</p>
