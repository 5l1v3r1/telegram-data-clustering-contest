      <p>TORONTO — The Canadian dollar weakened to</p>
      <p>a near six-week low against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday</p>
      <p>after a speech by a senior Bank of Canada official supported the</p>
      <p>view that the central bank is moving closer to an interest rate</p>
      <p>cut.</p>
      <p>Canada’s financial system is in a relatively good place to</p>
      <p>weather any potential storms generated by a weakening global</p>
      <p>economy and the trade war between the United States and China,</p>
      <p>Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said.</p>
      <p>“The open-ended tone of Wilkins’ remarks arguably pushed the</p>
      <p>Bank slightly closer to the easing posture that’s been adopted</p>
      <p>by other key central banks in recent months,” Don Curren, a</p>
      <p>market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments, said in a note.</p>
      <p>Chances of a Bank of Canada interest rate cut as soon as</p>
      <p>March rose to 64% from less than 60% before Wilkins’ speech,</p>
      <p>data from the overnight index swaps market showed.</p>
      <p>In October, Canada’s central bank shifted to a more dovish</p>
      <p>stance as it cut its economic growth forecasts and expressed</p>
      <p>concern about global trade uncertainty.</p>
      <p>At 3:07 p.m. (2007 GMT), the Canadian dollar was</p>
      <p>trading 0.4% lower at 1.3264 to the greenback, or 75.39 U.S.</p>
      <p>cents. The currency touched its weakest intraday level since</p>
      <p>Oct. 11 at 1.3272.</p>
      <p>The decline for the loonie came as thousands of workers at</p>
      <p>Canada’s largest railway went on strike for the first time in a</p>
      <p>decade, disrupting the shipping of commodities, and domestic</p>
      <p>data showed monthly declines for factory sales and home</p>
      <p>prices.</p>
      <p>Canadian factory sales decreased by 0.2% in September,</p>
      <p>hampered by partial shutdowns for maintenance at some</p>
      <p>refineries, data from Statistics Canada showed.</p>
      <p>The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index fell</p>
      <p>0.1% in October, weighed by seasonal pressures.</p>
      <p>Adding to headwinds for the loonie was a sharp drop in the</p>
      <p>price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports. U.S. crude oil</p>
      <p>futures settled 3.2% lower at $55.21 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield</p>
      <p>curve, with the two-year up 4.5 Canadian cents to</p>
      <p>yield 1.517% and the 10-year rising 33 Canadian</p>
      <p>cents to yield 1.451%.</p>
      <p>The gap between Canada’s 2-year yield and its U.S.</p>
      <p>counterpart widened by 2.9 basis points to a spread of 8.1 basis</p>
      <p>points in favor of the U.S. bond.</p>
      <p>Canada’s inflation report for October is due on Wednesday,</p>
      <p>while Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz is due to speak on</p>
      <p>Thursday on economic change.</p>
