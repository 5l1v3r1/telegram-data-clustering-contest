      <h1>Terabytes of data leaked from an oligarch-friendly offshore bank</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:37:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/DDoSecrets">Distributed Denial of Secrets Twitter account</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/HunnaFresh/status/1196657393704275968">published links</a> to terabytes of data identified as raw data from the Cayman National Bank and Trust; Phineas Fisher (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22phineas+fisher%22">previously</a>), the public-interest hacker(s) behind the Hacking Team breach, is credited with the leak.</p>
      <p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb5agy/phineas-fisher-offers-dollar100000-bounty-for-hacks-against-banks-and-oil-companies">Fisher claimed to have hacked the bank in 2016</a> and <a href="https://crimethinc.com/2019/11/17/hacking-back-how-to-rob-a-bank-expropriate-redistribute-and-leak-dispatches-from-the-digital-trenches">proposed a "Hacktivist Bug Hunting Program"</a> that would offer bounties of up to $100,000 to those who hacked and dumped documents "in the public interest" from companies such as "South America, Israeli spyware vendor NSO Group, and oil company Halliburton." The document (which is full of references to <a href="https://boingboing.net/tag/cult-of-the-dead-cow">Cult of the Dead Cow text files</a>) also outlines a series of techniques for compromising bank security and exfiltrating money.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ne8p9b/offshore-bank-targeted-phineas-fisher-confirms-hack-cayman-national-bank">Cayman National Bank and Trust has confirmed that it suffered a breach</a>.</p>
      <p>The Distributed Denial of Secrets tweet links to a <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/file/Sherwood/">slow and overloaded server</a> said to have the files from the breach; an <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/file/Sherwood/Sherwood.torrent">associated torrent file</a> promises access to the same data.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/file/Sherwood/HackBack.txt">a Spanish-language "Hack Back" document</a> released with the data, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191117132050/https://pastebin.com/raw/cH7sGCrU">mirrored here in English translation</a>, a person using the pen-name "Subcowmandante Marcos" (presumed to be Fisher) describes their motives: "As long as there is injustice, exploitation, alienation, violence and the ecological destruction, there will come many more like me: an endless series of people who will reject as illegitimate the bad system responsible for this suffering."</p>
      <p>Distributed Denial of Secrets founder Emma Best <a href="https://twitter.com/NatSecGeek/status/1196029540520407041">dedicated the leak</a> Anonymous activist to Jeremy Hammond (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22jeremy%20hammond%22">previously</a>), who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in hacking and dumping the <a href="https://boingboing.net/2011/12/25/stratfor-hacked-clients-and-c.html">private intelligence contractor Stratfor</a>.</p>
      <p>The Twitter thread associated with the leaks promises "an unprecedented look inside the operations (up to a month ago) of an international bank catering to the rich and powerful and those seeking to hide their activities, as well as of the banking system itself.</p>
      <p>Phisher's manifesto implies that the attack netted more than documents, and may have included the exfiltration of large sums of money. The announcement was tied to the centenary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expropriative_anarchism#Argentina">a politically motivated robbery in Argentina</a> undertaken to exact revenge for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_Week_(Argentina)">Semana Tragica</a>, a weeklong slaughter of radicals.</p>
