      <p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/new-york">New York</a> Attorney General Letitia James announced a lawsuit against Juul, the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/amid-increased-attention-cigarette-bans-vaping-advocates-turn/story?id=65991078">e-cigarette</a> company, because of its marketing practices, which she says were geared toward youth.</p>

      <p>"Juul basically took a page from Big Tobacco's playbook," James said Tuesday during a news briefing in New York.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, alleges that Juul engaged in deceptive marketing practices and illegally sold e-cigarettes to minors on its website and through third-party retail stores. The suit further alleges Juul advertising campaigns failed to warn consumers that Juul e-cigarettes contain nicotine, and falsely marketed them as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes.</p>

        <figcaption>New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, arrives to announce a lawsuit by the state of New York against e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc in New York, Nov. 19, 2019.</figcaption>

      <p>In at least one instance, Juul engaged in direct outreach to high school students in New York City, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
      <p>At present, Juul holds 70% of the e-cigarette market, according to James. There are currently 4.1 million high school students and 1.2 million middle school students who use e-cigarette products.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit also pointed to Juul's pervasive social media marketing, including popularizing hashtags like #Vaporized, #JUUL, #LightsCameraVapor and #JUULvapor.</p>
      <p>A study published this summer in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871619302595?via%3Dihub">Drug and Alcohol Dependence</a> found that 45% of the Twitters users following the account @JUULvapor were between the ages of 13 and 17. Only 20% of @JUULvapor's followers were 21 years old or older.</p>
      <p>James said the death of a 17-year-old boy in the Bronx, which was linked to vaping, cemented her decision to move forward with the lawsuit. It's not clear whether the teenager used Juul products.</p>
      <p>Still, James said, "As a result of all of their advertising, a significant number of young people thought that e-cigarettes were safe."</p>
      <p>"Juul has to take responsibility for their actions," she added.</p>
      <p>New York is the third state to file a lawsuit against Juul for marketing to youth. California's attorney general filed a similar suit on Monday, and North Carolina filed a suit in May. Several other states, including Illinois and Massachusetts, are currently investigating the e-cigarette company.</p>
      <p>There have been 2,172 lung injuries and 42 deaths linked to vaping, according to the latest count from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/s1114-update-number-vaping.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>
      <p>The CDC adds, "THC is present in most of the samples tested by FDA to date, and most patients report a history of using THC-containing e-cigarette, or vaping, products."</p>
