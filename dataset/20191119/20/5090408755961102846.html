        </li>
        <li>
          <b><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/work-stock">Slack</a> plunged as much as 11% on the news. In October, Slack reported 12 million daily active users.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>In addition to having more daily active users than Slack, Microsoft also said that Teams users grew by more than 50% since its last report in July.</b>

      <p>Shares of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/work-stock">Slack</a> fell as much as 11% Tuesday after <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/msft-stock">Microsoft</a> reported that its competing messaging product, Teams, has 20 million daily active users.</p>
      <p>That’s 8 million more users than Slack, which reported <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-daily-active-users-microsoft-teams-2019-10">12 million daily active users</a> in October.</p>
      <p>It’s also a huge gain in the lead Microsoft already had over Slack. In July, the company announced that it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams-daily-active-users-slack-2019-7">had 13 million daily active users</a>. That means that Microsoft has seen usage of Teams increase more than 50% in the last few months. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/msft-stock">Microsoft</a> shares were relatively unchanged Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Slack, on the other hand, has argued that while it doesn’t have as many daily active users, the ones that do use the application spend more than nine hours a day using it, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-daily-active-users-microsoft-teams-2019-10">showing that people actually like using the product</a>.</p>
      <p>The company has also previously called out Microsoft for its business practices, calling it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-ceo-microsoft-sees-us-as-an-existential-threat-2019-10">“surprisingly unsportsmanlike</a>.” Microsoft offers Teams for free to businesses that use Microsoft Office 365, which could mean that it’s counting users that don’t actually use Teams very often, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-ceo-microsoft-sees-us-as-an-existential-threat-2019-10">Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield has claimed.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/work-stock">Slack is down more than 45%</a> since spiking nearly 50% during its first day of public trading in June.</p>
      <p>Slack has a consensus price target of $29.65 and nine “buy” ratings, 8 “hold” ratings, and two “sell” ratings from analysts covering the company, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
