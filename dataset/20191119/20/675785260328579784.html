      <h2>Former I'm A Celeb campmate Nicola McLean says the US reality star will be banned from sharing any juicy gossip about her famous family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:37:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> could be banned from sharing secrets about the Kardashians on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> , it's been claimed.</p>
      <p>Former campmate Nicola McLean reckons Caitlyn wouldn't be able to blab any good gossip about her famous family even if she wanted to.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn used to be married to Kardashian momager Kris Jenner and was a step-parent to Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob for years.</p>
      <p>She also shares two daughters, Kendall and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> , with Kris.</p>
      <p>She was a regular face on Keeping Up With The Kardashians since day one, but started popping up less and less after her transition in 2015 caused friction, particularly after the claims she made about Kris in her book The Secrets Of My Life.</p>

      <p>Nicola, who was a campmate in the jungle in 2008, reckons legal reasons could stop Caitlyn giving up the gossip.</p>
      <p>She also thinks legal issues could stop Nadine Coyle from talking about her time in Girls Aloud.</p>
      <p>She knows all about the issues after spending time in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> house with Kim's ex Ray J, who she made that infamous sex tape with.</p>

      <p>She told <a href="http://www.closeronline.co.uk/">Closer</a> magazine: "As much as we're hoping for exciting Kardashian or Cheryl gossip, it might not be the case, because lawyers watch each episode before it airs to make sure the people campmates are talking about aren't defamed.</p>
      <p>"I was in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity Big Brother</a> with Ray J - Kim's ex, with whom she did the sex tape - and he told us loads of stuff, but it never aired because of legal reasons."</p>
      <p>Sadly, that means anyone hoping to hear some juicy gossip about Kris and her brood may be bitterly disappointed.</p>

      <p>So far, Caitlyn has talked about the Kardashians, but more in passing than anything else.</p>
