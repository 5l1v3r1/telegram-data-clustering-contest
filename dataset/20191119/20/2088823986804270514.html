      <p>ALBANY – Assemblyman Robin Schimminger, a Kenmore Democrat who has been in office since the post-Watergate era, will not seek re-election next year, the lawmaker told The Buffalo News on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Schimminger, first elected to the Assembly in 1976, will serve out his term but not run in the November 2020 elections.</p>
      <p>“Going forward, I would like to be able to spend more time with family," Schimminger, 72, said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to continuing to serve our community for the duration of my present term," he added. “It has been a privilege and a honor to be able to represent the people and places that have been a part of my life."</p>
      <p>Schimminger, a conservative Democrat, is the longtime chairman of the Assembly economic development committee.</p>
      <p>Born in North Tonawanda, Schimminger is the dean of the Western New York delegation, a group of Democrats and Republicans with both overlapping and competing interests on any sort of fiscal and policy fronts.</p>
      <p>Among the last breed of New York Democrats – those who run also with Conservative Party support – Schimminger easily won re-election in 2018 in what was the 22nd time he ran for the Assembly seat that represents the town of Tonawanda, parts of north Buffalo, the City of Tonawanda and part of North Tonawanda.</p>
      <p>Schimminger earned a reputation for working across party lines, and he has attracted much wrath from allies of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for sharply criticizing the governor’s economic development policies and lack of what the lawmaker says is transparency in job creation programs. A Cuomo spokesman did not return an email seeking comment.</p>
      <p>“He was somebody who was never afraid to take on the governor, whether it be this governor or anybody," said Ray Walter, a former GOP assemblyman from Amherst who drove home with Schimminger after session each week for a couple years.</p>
      <p>“He was an advocate for the power of the Legislature and not always ceding power to the executive, and I think it bothered him how much of that went on the last few years," Walter said.</p>
      <p>The 140th, with a total of 87,000 registered voters, includes 39,500 registered Democrats and 22,500 Republicans. Among the names floating about Tuesday as potential Schimminger replacements were Democrats Patrick Mang, the Kenmore mayor; Jeremy Zellner, the Erie County Democratic Party chairman; and Kenmore lawyer Kevin Stocker.</p>
      <p>While he was not announcing Tuesday, Zellner said it would be the “honor of my lifetime" to represent the 140th Assembly district. Mang, who is Schimminger’s neighbor, said he is interested in running.</p>
      <p>Word of Schimminger’s decision surprised some of his colleagues, including Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, a Buffalo Democrat. She credited him with driving state funds and attention to cultural groups across the region and helping to advance the Buffalo medical corridor development, as well as giving the delegation valuable institutional knowledge of Albany.</p>
      <p>The author of many dozens of state laws, Schimminger cited one in particular: a major tort law changed that allowed people exposed to toxic substances with latency effects, such as asbestos, to seek civil recoveries for their injuries and illnesses.</p>
      <p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who Schimminger called Monday with his decision, said Schimminger has become an economic development expert who has “strived to make New York a better place to live and work.”</p>
      <p>“The reward of public service is the opportunity to be of service to one’s community," said Schimminger, who has been a keen voice for small and large businesses in Albany over the years. A New York University law school graduate, the lawmaker previously served two terms in the Erie County Legislature.</p>
