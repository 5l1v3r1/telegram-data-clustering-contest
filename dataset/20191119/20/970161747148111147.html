      <p>A painter caught with cocaine in his car tried to blame the wind for blowing the powdered drug into his vehicle, police say.</p>
      <p>Joseph Zak, 37, reportedly offered the unusual excuse after being pulled over by police in Fort Pierce, Florida, on November 15.</p>
      <p>Zak caught their attention after he failed to yield at a stop sign that evening, according to <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/coke-in-the-wind-285903">The Smoking Gun.</a></p>
      <p>After flashing their lights, an officer reportedly noticed Zak making ‘furtive movements’ inside his moving sedan.</p>
      <p>He was reportedly seen ‘leaning over towards the center console as (if) attempting to discard an item out of the passenger window.’</p>
      <p>Zak eventually pulled over, with an officer who got out of the car spotting him trying to hide an open can of Budweiser as he walked up to its window.</p>

      <p>The vehicle was then searched, with officers finding a glass crack pipe, as well as a clear baggie filled with white residue, which later tested positive for crack cocaine.</p>
      <p>Zak denied the drugs were his, and said ‘the police or the wind must have placed it there.’</p>
      <p>He was subsequently charged with multiple offenses, including drug crimes, and was booked into St Lucie County Jail.</p>
      <p>Zak is now free in bond, and will appear before a court for an arraignment hearing on December 3.</p>
