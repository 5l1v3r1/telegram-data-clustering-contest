      <p>A woman became temporarily paralysed after a single tick bite while on a camping weekend in the Scottish Highlands.</p>
      <p>Emma Love found herself unable to stand up five weeks after the tick left a horrific bacterial infection in her bloodstream.</p>
      <p>She dragged herself to bed hoping it was just flu but the powerlessness in her legs was the first symptom of potentially deadly <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lyme-disease">Lyme disease.</a></p>
      <p>Although she says the feeling came back gradually, she was left with numbness, pins and needles and weakness in her left leg.</p>
      <p>Three years on, the infection has spread to her brain, <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/health/lyme-disease-paralyses-ni-woman-17274590">Belfast Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>She says she has been left unable to work for the last two years and just wants to get back to living the life of a 29 year old.</p>
      <p>Emma, from Co Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, was left with debilitating and terrifying symptoms yet no accurate diagnosis for three years.</p>

      <p>She said: “I became suddenly unwell a few weeks after we were camping in the Highlands in Scotland in 2016. I’d been camping with my partner Ryan. We had a great getaway but little did we know how much I’d have to pay for this small pleasure.</p>
      <p>“One day when I went to stand up and my legs gave way and I fell to the floor. I had no power in my legs and although it came back gradually, I was left with numbness, pins and needles and weakness in my left leg.</p>
      <p>“I think back to that weekend in the Highlands and remember it being so happy and carefree but it has ruined my health and my life.</p>

      <p>“I underwent many tests including brain and spinal MRI, blood tests and neurological examinations.</p>
      <p>“I was discharged after a week and advised no one honestly knew what was wrong with me (so) I’d have to visit neurology as an outpatient.</p>
      <p>“Then I became unable to use my left arm, it wasn’t safe for me to be on my own. I’d burn myself and wouldn't feel the burn on my left arm until it was too late. I couldn’t get in and out of the bath or even make myself tea."</p>

      <p>She continued: “I was tested for all sorts including MS and my symptoms continued to get worse.</p>
      <p>“Every month I developed a new symptom or pain and had many tests, non invasive and invasive including numerous MRIs, nerve conduction studies and a lumbar puncture.</p>
      <p>“I was diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder, migraines, trapped nerves, fibromyalgia, costochondritis, trochanteric bursitis which is inflammation of rib case and hip joints."</p>

        <figcaption>Her life has completely changed since the infection</figcaption>

      <p>Despite the best efforts of the NHS, it was only when Emma’s great aunt mentioned the possibility of Lyme disease did the picture suddenly become clearer.</p>
      <p>Home-spun research revealed each of her symptoms could be attributed to Lyme disease and extensive tests by a private specialist proved her aunt right .</p>
      <p>Emma said: “My mum researched the best lab to get the Lyme disease test done and it was completed in Germany and one week later the results were in.</p>
      <p>“They showed I have chronic Lyme Disease or Lyme Neuroborreliosis which means this bacteria has hosted itself in my brain. Plus I have co-infections and a very suppressed immune system. </p>
      <p>“So after three years of suffering I now had an answer.</p>
      <p>“I have since followed every possible route to get the treatment I need on the NHS but due to a lack of recognition and resources in Northern Ireland the available options have provided no answers yet.</p>

        <figcaption>Emma and Ryan enjoyed a blissful few days in the Highlands of Scotland</figcaption>

      <p>“The main priority for my family and myself is for me to get well again as three years of my life has been lost to unexplained illness and misdiagnoses.</p>
      <p>“So we have no choice but to go private once again but with my family having exhausted their means of paying for private appointments, I have to ask for help.  </p>
      <p>“I’ve been unable to work for two years now due to this horrific disease. I really want this treatment so I can get better, get back to working and living the normal life of a 29 year old.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ill since I was 26 and I feel I have lost out on so much, this illness has taken away a few years of my life and now I know what is causing the illness, I want to treat it and get better.</p>
      <p>“It’s frightening because if Chronic Lyme disease is left untreated it can lead to death. At the moment I’ve had all of the disease symptoms apart from heart problems, so I want to get treated as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“Now we have found a private specialist and by following his treatment plans, his patients report getting back to nearly full-health which is amazing.</p>
      <p>“These appointments are expensive and he treats using both western medicine and alternative medicine. So it will be a long-term treatment plan which includes being on medication for up to two years.”</p>

      <p>Emma is hoping a massive and long term dose of antibiotics may help get her a bit of her old life back.</p>
      <p>She explained: “There are days when the most I can do is lay on the settee and cuddle my dog. I am in pain all the time, I’m exhausted. My memory is terrible, my concentration is very poor and I feel decrepid.  I have  developed issues with my full left side of my body and have constant weakness in my left arm, leg and my neck.</p>
      <p>“I just want to get my life back. I used to be so busy and happy and full of life and fun.</p>
      <p>"I have my first appointment with the specialist in February which cannot come quick enough. It will be a long process but there is light at the end of the tunnel for once in the past few years.”</p>

      <p>Emma’s life in Scotland started with great hopes in 2010 and she completed my BA Hons in Tourism and Event Management</p>
      <p>She said: “After I graduated I stayed in Glasgow and got a job with NHS 24 and discovered I really enjoyed helping people. I never thought for that I’d have to ask for help for myself, or be chronically ill especially all before I’d hit the age of 30.”</p>
      <p>Emma had to quit her job and her life in Scotland and moved home to Enniskillen two years ago to be closer to family.</p>
      <p>She had to give up her work and her freedom and rely on her boyfriend Ryan to become her carer.</p>
      <p>She said: “Ryan has stuck with me but our lives are completely changed. I’m not the person I used to be, Ryan had to give up his work in insurance and look after me and he took a part time job in KFC and he needs it to get a break from caring for me all day.</p>
      <p>“I cannot turn the clock back and I’m determined to get as well as I can but I need help.”</p>
      <p>It means undergoing heavy-duty, long-term antibiotics to try to bring the bacteria in her brain under control.</p>
      <p>And it’s going to initially cost thousands and so far Emma has raised £2,300 and needs and other £2,000 to pay for her appointments.</p>
      <p>Emma said: “I can’t believe I’m in this position asking for donations to help me get my life back, I want to go back to being the person I used to be - or as close as possible.”</p>
