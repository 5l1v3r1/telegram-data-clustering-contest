      </p>
      <p>Former Tottenham and England striker Gary Lineker says the club will not find a better manager than Mauricio Pochettino, after the Argentinian was relieved of his duties.</p>
      <p>Spurs confirmed the departure of Pochettino, along with his coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez, in a club statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The news comes after Tottenham made a dismal start to the 2019-20 season, winning just three of their first 12 Premier League games and suffering a humiliating 7-2 home defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Yet although he was unable to win a trophy during his five-and-a-half-year stint in north London, Pochettino’s standing remained high after he guided Spurs to four successive top-four finishes and last season’s Champions League final, which they lost to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Lineker wrote: “Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by @SpursOfficial. He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement….ain’t gonna happen.”</p>

      <p>Spurs’ next game is at West Ham on Saturday. They are 14th in the Premier League, 11 points adrift of the final Champions League qualification place.</p>
