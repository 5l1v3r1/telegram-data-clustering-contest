      <h1>Gavin Henson slams Johnny McNicholl and Willis Halaholo Wales call-ups</h1>
      <h2>It is an issue that evokes strong opinions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:54:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Southcombe</a></address>
      <p>Welsh rugby icon Gavin Henson has aired his displeasure at New Zealand-born duo <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wales-rugby-squad-announcement-live-17278316">Johnny McNicholl and Willis Halaholo being selected for Wales</a> .</p>
      <p>The wing and centre were two of five uncapped players to be named in Wayne Pivac's 35-man squad to face the Barbarians later this month in an uncapped fixture.</p>
      <p>McNicholl and Halaholo have both become eligible to play for Wales on residency grounds, having been in the country for three years.</p>
      <p>But, in a short tweet, Henson, who played 33 times for Wales, revealed his verdict.</p>
      <p>"This is so wrong," he posted on his official Twitter account, accompanied by a screengrab of BBC Wales' story carrying the headline: 'New Wales coach picks McNicholl and Halaholo in first squad'.</p>

      <p>The issue of selecting foreign-born players who have become eligible on residency grounds is a polarising one that evokes strong opinions.</p>
      <p>In 2017, World Rugby voted to extend the eligibility period from three to five years, which comes into effect at the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>The selection of players born in a different country is nothing new and many teams around the world take advantage of the residency rule.</p>
      <p>It was a topic <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/rules-rules-everyone-picking-overseas-17283949">discussed on this week's Welsh Rugby Podcast.</a></p>
      <p>"I would like to see a situation whereby if you're Welsh, you play for Wales and if you're Fijian, you play for Fiji, not for New Zealand, Australia or England," said WalesOnline's Andy Howell.</p>
      <p>"That being said, the rules are the rules. The eligibility criteria has actually been changed by World Rugby going forward.</p>

      <p>"But these boys have already qualified - why not pick them?</p>
      <p>"Australia's team is full of overseas players, New Zealand still have some, England have got some. Why not?</p>
      <p>"Hadleigh Parkes has been a roaring success for Wales.</p>
      <p>"If everyone else is picking overseas players, why not pick them?"</p>
      <p>Welsh scrum-half Rhys Webb, who is currently ineligible for Wales under the current selection policy, posted his support for Halaholo and pointed out: "Great to see a lot of new faces in the mix who have been putting their hand up week in week out (at) their regions. Enjoy every minute."</p>
