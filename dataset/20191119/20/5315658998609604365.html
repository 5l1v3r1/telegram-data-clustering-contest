        <b>Cowboy Clampers Will Be Stymied</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ‘wheel clamping’ Bill that will cap clamper fees to $100 passed its third reading in Parliament today.</p>
      <p>New Zealand First welcomes The Land Transport (Wheel Clamping) Amendment Bill to combat predatory wheel clamping behaviour in what is currently a largely unregulated business.</p>
      <p>Cowboy clampers are:<br/>• gouging people for sometimes more than $700,<br/>• demanding cash, on the spot payments,<br/>• using threats and intimidation tactics.</p>
      <p>“We support businesses right to enforce parking policy on their premises, but this can be done without exploitative fees,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Consumer Affairs, Clayton Mitchell.</p>
      <p>“One case that caught my attention was an unwell <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/103057079/frail-west-auckland-nana-clamped-while-looking-for-help">86-year-old, West Auckland Grandmother</a> who had her wheel clamped while she parked her car to seek urgent attention from a GP.</p>
      <p>“When she returned to her car, the clamper appeared in person and demanded $200 cash.</p>
      <p>“The $200 fee was revoked but only after the police were involved.</p>
      <p>“Clamping fees need to accurately reflect the gravity of the violation.<br/>“We believe a capped fee of $100 still is an adequate deterrent.<br/>“New Zealand First is proud to be a part of a Coalition Government putting an end to this bottom feeder behaviour,” says Mr Mitchell.<br/><b>ENDS</b></p>
