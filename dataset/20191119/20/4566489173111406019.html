      <h1>TV prequel to Polanski's 'Chinatown' in works</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:30:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>The Oscar-winning writer of Roman Polanski's "Chinatown" is working on a television series set before the events of the 1974 movie, a spokeswoman told AFP on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The show, which is in early development, will serve as a prequel to the noir classic about corruption in Los Angeles, confirmed the spokeswoman for 84-year-old screenwriter Robert Towne.</p>
      <p>"The Social Network" director David Fincher is also attached to the project being produced by Netflix, according to trade publication Variety, which broke the news.</p>
      <p>Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Polanski, who has been a fugitive from US justice since admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977, is not involved in the new project.</p>
      <p>This month the French-Polish director was accused of raping another young woman in 1975. Polanski, 86, denies attacking Valentine Monnie, and has threatened to sue his accusers.</p>
      <p>A French guild of more than 200 filmmakers this week said it will propose new rules for members charged or convicted of sexual violence, which could lead to Polanski's suspension.</p>
      <p>Polanski made "Chinatown" on his return to Hollywood five years after his heavily pregnant wife Sharon Tate was murdered by the Charles Manson gang.</p>
      <p>The movie was nominated for 11 Oscars, including best film, best director, best actor (Jack Nicholson) and best actress (Faye Dunaway.)</p>
      <p>It won one Academy Award -- best original screenplay for Towne.</p>
      <p>A sequel, "Two Jakes," was released in 1990. Directed by Nicholson, who reprised his role as private detective Jake Gittes, the film was also written by Towne.</p>
