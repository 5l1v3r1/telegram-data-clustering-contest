      <p>The former Spurs striker questioned the club's decision to dispense with a man who led them to the Champions League final for the first time last season.</p>

      <p>Lineker said on Twitter: "He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement....ain't gonna happen."</p>
      <p>Former England midfielder Trevor Sinclair blamed Totteham's players for letting their manager down, tweeting: "Tottenham players need to have a look at themselves in the mirror tonight after what Poch has done for them #Pochettino."</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher backed Pochettino to be back managing in the Premier League soon.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "I said a few weeks ago I felt this project had ran its course, I thought there would be a change at the end of the season with either the manager or players changing. Pochettino has been a brilliant manager for Spurs &amp; will be back in the PL sooner rather than later!."</p>
