      <p>Steve McManaman has backed close pal Ian Wright to quickly become a fans' favourite on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! - because he'll leave viewers in stitches.</p>
      <p>Wright, the former England and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> striker, has entered the Australian jungle for this year's installment of the ITV hit show and is being touted as one of the favourites to win.</p>
      <p>McManaman knows the former football from their days as England internationals, while the pair have lined up together as pundits for BT Sport in recent years.</p>
      <p>And the former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> midfielder has explained why he reckons Wright will win over fans.</p>

      <p>“He’s currently the bookmakers’ favourite and I think everybody knows Wrighty," he told HorseRacing.net.</p>
      <p>"He’s a great character; he’s laughing all the time, he’s joking all the time, so he’s got a wonderful chance of winning it.</p>
      <p>“The people at home who do all the voting will probably love him, but you just don’t know how people react.</p>
      <p>"They have to do the trials, they have to do things they don’t like, but for comedic value I think he’s going to be absolutely brilliant.</p>

      <p>“He’s going to be the person that keeps everybody laughing, keeping spirits high and jovial. You just hope they all get through it when they’ve got no food to eat.”</p>
      <p>And McManaman also reckons Wright has the perfect attitude to enjoy the experience Down Under.</p>
      <p>He added: “Everybody knows, apart from Harry Redknapp that is, what the show’s about.</p>
      <p>“Everybody knows that there’s spiders and snakes, that you can be locked away, that it’s claustrophobic and that you’re going to have no food.</p>

      <p>“Everybody will go through their emotions if they don’t eat and they don’t sleep, and everybody gets grumpy at times - but Wrighty has the capacity to be fine with it if I’m being honest.</p>
      <p>“He’s a really good mate of mine and I love him to bits, I think his attitude is brilliant and I hope that he does really well.</p>
      <p>“However, I don’t think you’ll see me on the show anytime soon. I don’t think it’s my style if I’m being completely honest!”</p>
