      <p>OTTAWA - Canada's slow economic growth and competitiveness is undercutting its global interests, experts say, as the post "sunny ways" version of the Trudeau government's foreign policy emerges Wednesday with the announcement of a new cabinet.</p>
      <p>The key moving parts could include a replacement for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, who might be given a new domestic portfolio, and the fact that International Trade Minister Jim Carr is fighting a form of blood cancer that makes him an unlikely candidate for a heavy travel schedule.</p>
      <p>Trevin Stratton, chief economist of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, says Canada's low-growth economy is eroding its broader standing on the world stage, even as managing relations with both the United States and China remains a paramount priority.</p>
      <p>He says Canada's international ranking in a series of global surveys continued to decline in recent months, including during the federal election campaign.</p>
      <p>That includes a slide in the World Economic Forum's ranking of the productivity of G20 countries, which saw Canada drop two positions to 14th place.</p>
      <p>Stratton says Canada also fell to 23rd place among countries in the World Bank's "ease of doing business" ranking and received a lower mark in another index that ranks the "soft power" of 30 leading countries.</p>
