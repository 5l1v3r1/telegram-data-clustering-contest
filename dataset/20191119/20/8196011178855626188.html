      <p>Wall Street’s reaction so far to Walt Disney’s long-awaited streaming service suggests investors believe the competition may not be as crushing as expected for entertainment rival Netflix.</p>
      <p>Shares of Disney have surged 8% since the launch of Disney+ a week ago, helped along by 10 million sign-ups for the service in its first day.</p>
      <p>However, during the same period, Netflix’s stock recovered from an initial slump and is now up nearly 3%, with some investors betting the two companies’ streaming offerings may be able to coexist.</p>
      <p>At the start of the week, Disney rose just shy of its record high close on November 13, while Netflix climbed 2.6% to its highest close since August.</p>
      <p>“I’m a consumer of both services and I can tell you that what my kids watch on Netflix is not what they watch on Disney+.</p>
      <p>"Now I get it, and the market is reacting to that, appreciating the shares of both companies,” said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Investors for months have viewed the looming launch of Disney+ as the most dangerous challenge yet to Netflix’s dominance of an increasingly crowded video streaming market.</p>
      <p>Disney’s shares have risen 27% since April when Disney+ was unveiled, while Netflix remains down 18%.</p>
      <p>Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings warned in September that competition arising from the entrance of Apple, Disney and NBC to the global streaming market would spark a surge in content costs, adding to worries about Netflix’s already slowing subscriber growth.</p>
      <p>Apple earlier this month launched its streaming video service, with a slim offering of original shows, for $5 (€4.50) per month, compared to Netflix’s $13 per month standard price. AT&amp;T’s HBO Max is set to launch in early in 2020.</p>
      <p>Disney’s $7 per month service includes family-friendly new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the world’s most popular entertainment franchises.</p>
      <p>However, Disney+ steers clear of content aimed at more mature audiences, often popular on Netflix, giving consumers reasons to pay for both, Mr Lip said.</p>
      <p>After its surge, Disney’s stock is trading at 23 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>As investors reconsider the value of Netflix, its forward earnings multiple has been trading at under 60 since September, far below its mean of 148 in the last five years.</p>
