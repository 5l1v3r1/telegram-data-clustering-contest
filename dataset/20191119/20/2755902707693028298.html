      <p><a href="https://iharare.com/zesa-reverts-to-stage-load-shedding/">Zimbabweans are enduring 18 hours of load shedding a day</a>, a situation that has crippled industry and compromised the livelihoods of many Zimbabweans. To make matters worse load shedding has created a lucrative business opportunity for criminals who are now stealing Copper from ZESA transformers. Owing to the long hours of no electricity, Transformers have become an easy target as tampering with them now comes at no risk of injury or loss of life.</p>
      <p>The pictures below of a vandalised transformer in Glen Norah were shared by ZESA Public relations Officer <a href="https://twitter.com/GwasiraFullard">Fullard Gwasira</a>.</p>

      <p>In Other News The Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe has disputed the figures of aid they donated to Zimbabwe which were given out by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube during the 2020 National Budget presentation last week.</p>
      <p>According to Mthuli Ncube, the Chinese donated only US$3.6 million. This figure pales in comparison to the US$50 donated by the United State government, the US$50 million donated by the United Kingdom, the US$41 million donated by the European Union and the US$28 million donated by Sweden.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly the Chinese were not happy about these figures and insisted that there was a shortfall of more than US$133 million. According to the Chinese Embassy, the bilateral aid to Zimbabwe stands at US$136.8m and not US$3.6 million.<a href="https://iharare.com/mthuli-lied-us133m-is-missing-furious-chinese/">Read More</a></p>
