      <p><b>NEW YORK — </b>Taylor Swift's former label said on Monday that it will allow the global pop superstar to perform some of her early hits at an awards show this month — the latest twist in a months-long public feud over the rights to her first six albums.<br/><br/>But even the seeming resolution of the spat did not come without some confusion.<br/><br/>The Big Machine Label Group released what it called a joint statement with Dick Clark Productions — which puts on the American Music Awards — saying they had "reached a licensing agreement" that would allow Swift to sing what she wants at the Nov. 24 ceremony.<br/><br/>But shortly thereafter, the producers distanced themselves from the situation, saying it was between Swift and her ex-label.<br/><br/>Big Machine, which is based in Nashville, then clarified that it had "informed" the production company of its licensing approval.<br/><br/>Swift's publicist did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the pop star has yet to react publicly.<br/><br/>Last week, Swift — known for her calculating social media strategy — said on Tumblr that Big Machine heads were "exercising tyrannical control" over her.<br/><br/>She claimed they had told her she was "not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I'm allowed to next year."<br/><br/>The pop superstar — famous for megahits like "Shake It Off" and "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" — also said Big Machine was preventing her from using "older music or performance footage" for a Netflix project.<br/><br/>The company, which did not refer to the Netflix issue in its latest statements, denied the allegations last week.<br/><br/>"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media," Big Machine said on Monday.<br/><br/>"Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed."<br/><br/>Swift began publicly sparring with industry mogul Scooter Braun this summer over his purchase of her former label of more than a decade, which gave him a majority stake in the master recordings of her first six albums.<br/><br/>The 29-year-old then vowed to re-record her early albums to create copies she owns herself, saying her contract allows her to begin redoing albums one through five in November 2020 — when she plans to be back in the studio doing just that.<br/><br/>Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group in 2018 that gave her ownership of her masters going forward, including for her recently released seventh album "Lover." — AFP</p>
