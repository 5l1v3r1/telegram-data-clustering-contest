        <b>Liverpool ace Georginio Wijnaldum was on the mark for the Netherlands in their clash with Estonia on Tuesday night, but he had an important message to send too.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As noted by the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpools-gini-wijnaldum-makes-powerful-17280090">Liverpool Echo</a>, the Dutch international responded this week after being left disappointed and upset over a racism incident in the Dutch second division.</p>

      <p>Excelsior striker Ahmad Mendes Moreira was subjected to racist chanting during their clash with FC Den Bosch at the weekend, and Wijnaldum admitted that he was shocked and hurt by the incident.</p>
      <p>With that still fresh in his mind, the midfield star scored early in the encounter with Estonia and as seen in the video below, he sent a powerful message with the help of teammate Frenkie de Jong with their celebration.</p>
      <p>The pair joined up and pointed to their arms and more prominently, the colour of their skin</p>
