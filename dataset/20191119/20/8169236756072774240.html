      <h1>Superstar prepared to pay €20m of his own money to seal Barcelona transfer</h1>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10367022/neymar-funding-shock-barcelona-return/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574093035">the Sun</a> via Spanish outlet <a href="https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/olvidan-neymar-7740038">Sport</a>, Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar is open to paying around €20m (£17m) of his own money to seal a return to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Sport report that the Brazilian attacker’s potential return to the Nou Camp next summer is a “real possibility”. Neymar’s name dominated the summer transfer window but ultimately he didn’t escape from the Ligue 1 champions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20190502/461988957839/neymar-clausula-rescision-170-millones-ano-2020.html">Mundo Deportivo</a> claim that a termination clause of €170m will be activated in Neymar’s contract from June 2020, Sport hint that the 27-year-old will have to pay €20m of this figure himself to seal an exit.</p>
      <p>Sport also add that PSG would like Ivan Rakitic and promising defender Jean-Clair Todibo to be included in any deal for their prized asset.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/ligue-1/neymar-snubs-psg-attempt-to-renew-his-deal-7740187">Sport</a> have also reported that Neymar’s rejected PSG’s attempts to tie him down to a new contract, the Parisians are reportedly keen on tying him down until 2025.</p>

      <p>Neymar has only made five league appearances so far this season as he was troubled with injuries at the start of the campaign.</p>
      <p>With the majority of reports hinting that the Brazilian is working to return to Barcelona, we can’t see the superstar staying in Paris for much longer.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde has heaps of world class attacking options, is a move for Neymar really necessary to take the Blaugrana back to the top?</p>
