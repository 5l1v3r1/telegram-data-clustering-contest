      <p>Since its launch in June 2015, Apple Music has grown into a popular streaming service among Apple aficionados. At $9.99 per month for an individual account, $4.99 per month for a student plan, and $14.99 per month for a family (of up to six people) plan, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/services-players/67157/apple-music">Apple Music</a> lets you stream more than 50 million songs, listen to playlists created by music experts, and tune into the 24/7 Beats 1 radio station to hear tunes selected by DJs from around the world.</p>
      <p>You can listen to Apple Music via your Windows PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, Android device, newer Apple TVs, and even on the web. And you can try the service for free for three months. That sounds cool, but what if it's not everything you wanted? Perhaps it's too expensive, or you don't listen enough to justify the cost. Maybe another <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/services-players/5359/the-best-online-music-streaming-services">music streaming service</a> has stolen your heart and your ears. Whatever the reason, you want to cancel your membership. Here's how to say goodbye to Apple Music.</p>

      <p>Fire up your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Navigate to <b>Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; iTunes &amp; App Store</b>. Tap your Apple ID. From the pop-up window, tap the link to View Apple ID. Enter your password or sign in with Touch ID or Face ID to authenticate your account.</p>
