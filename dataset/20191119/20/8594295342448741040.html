      <p>Alfa Romeo’s Giulia and Stelvio will receive a mid-cycle refresh for the 2020 model year. As is the norm with Italian models, the changes are being referenced by Western media as a sexification providing erotic pleasure to the eyes. In truth, Fiat Chrysler is simply offering both models with optional appearance kits and freshened interiors.</p>
      <p>Then again, perhaps the true measure of automotive sexiness is finding a model you want to spend all of your spare time inside — as that’s often the benchmark with human beings.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, things appear unchanged. The 2.9-liter, twin-turbocharged V6 with 505 horsepower (thanks, Ferrari) persists in both the Giulia and Stelvio Quadrifoglios. Meanwhile, the 2.0-liter turbo will continue being fitted inside base-trimmed Alfas.</p>
      <p>New exterior styling comes by way of various appearance packages. Stelvio models receive a new body-color kit (standard on Sport models and above) with painted wheel flares, lower rocker panels, and a rear fascia. A “Dark Miron” appearance kit is also available on Sport models, if you’re more into contrasted exteriors. A similar “<a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2018/03/alfa-romeo-black-edition/">Nero Edizione Package</a>” was already introduced on the Giulia and Stelvio — incorporating additional items, like Dark Miron mirror caps, badges, brake calipers, headlamp bezels, exhaust tips, and more. Additionally, Alfa Romeo plans to offer new metallic paint colors, including Anodized Blue, and a carbon-fiber exterior pack for the Stelvio Quadrifoglio.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, more meaningful changes are taking place inside the cabin. For 2020, both models receive an all-new center console with an 8.8-inch screen (standard), leather-wrapped shifter, fancier-looking rotary control dial, freshened steering wheel designs, phone cubby with available wireless charging, and laminated front glass aimed at improving NHV.</p>
      <p>The user interface for the center console is also said to be upgraded with a faster processor and improved graphics — though the old one was among the easier automotive interfaces to live with. FCA decided to beef it up to make it quicker, adding “driver-configurable interactive widgets” and an updated version of Performance Pages. SiriusXM Radio also comes standard for 12 months, at which point you’ll need to buy a subscription.</p>

      <p>Everything else deals with largely optional advanced driver-assistance features. The brand claims both models will feature an ADAS package with “Level 2 autonomous driving” capabilities (so… not autonomous at all) with highway assist, traffic jam assist, lane keeping with assist, lane departure warnings, blind spot assist, traffic sign recognition, drowsy driver detection, and improved navigation. Forward collision warnings with emergency braking will be standard. Handy items, but we have to criticize Fiat Chrysler a bit for calling these features <i>autonomous</i>. If you don’t know why, <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/11/calling-for-clarity-auto-news-requests-revised-terminology-for-autonomous-tech/">here’s a link</a>.</p>
      <p>Both the 2020 Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio are said to begin to arriving in North American showrooms before year’s end. Base Giulias start at $39,345 (plus $1,295 destination) while Stelvio begins at $41,345 (with identical delivery fees). Going with a Quadrifoglio places destination charges at $1,595, with the cheaper Giulia starting at $74,445 and the Stelvio coming in at $80,445.</p>
