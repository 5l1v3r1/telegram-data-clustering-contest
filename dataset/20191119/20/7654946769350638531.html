      <p>Endy Chavez deleted his video throwing batting practice to injured Mets star Yoenis Cespedes quicker than Yadier Molina’s home run rendered his game-saving catch in the 2006 NLCS an afterthought.</p>
      <p>“Throwing BP to a prospect in recovery,” Chavez, now a minor-league instructor for the organization, posted as a caption alongside the video Tuesday morning on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Several outlets captured it before it was removed from the social media site, <a href="https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/watch-mets-outfielder-yoenis-cespedes-takes-batting-practice-in-florida/311917992">including SNY</a>, the team’s television network.</p>
      <p>Last week at the GM meetings in Arizona, Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen indicated that Cespedes’ status for 2020 remains uncertain. The $110 million outfielder missed all of last season with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/20/yoenis-cespedes-has-ankle-fractures-after-ranch-accident/">an ankle injury suffered on his Florida ranch</a> while recuperating from surgeries on both heels from the previous year.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have enough information to predict when he’s going to be back,” Van Wagenen said of Cespedes, who is due to earn $29.5 million in the final year of his contract.</p>
