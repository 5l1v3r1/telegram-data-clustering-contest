      <p>MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Brewers are bringing back the team’s iconic ball-in-glove logo next year.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee unveiled its new uniform designs and logo on Monday night at Miller Park. Starting in 2020, players will wear a modernized version of the ball-in-glove image first introduced in 1978 and worn until 1993.</p>
      <p>A “M” and the “B” are linked above the glove’s webbing. The ball features two vertical seams, making it look more authentic.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee will have two sets of uniforms at home and on the road. The primary home uniform features a cream color — a nod to Milwaukee’s nickname as “Cream City” for its cream-colored bricks — with a slightly curved “BREWERS” across the jersey.</p>
      <p>A 50th anniversary sleeve patch will commemorate the team’s half-century in Milwaukee after launching as the Seattle Pilots in 1969 and then moving. The new look was formulated with RARE Design in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.</p>
