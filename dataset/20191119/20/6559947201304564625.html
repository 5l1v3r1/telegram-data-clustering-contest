      <p> <b>$99.00</b></p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Ad-free. Included with an Amazon Prime subscription. Lets you import music files.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Missing some major artists. Some odd interface-design choices. No lyrics.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>Amazon Prime Music is a solid addition to the terrific Amazon Prime package, but the streaming music service alone won't likely make many people rush out to drop $99 on a year subscription.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>An underappreciated aspect of Amazon's Prime subscription service is the included Prime Music, a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/services-players/5359/the-best-online-music-streaming-services">streaming music service</a> that lets listeners dive into two million songs at no additional cost. Frankly, the best part of Amazon Prime Music <i>is</i> that it's free for Prime subscribers. Amazon Prime Music isn't bad—the service has a decent catalog and numerous interesting playlists—but it lacks Amazon Music Unlimited's deep catalog and the intriguing features you'll find in the Editors' Choice award-winning services SiriusXM Internet Radio and Spotify.</p>
      <h3>What You Get</h3>
      <p>The Amazon Prime Music home screen is divided into two main sections: a primary content section that takes up most of the screen real estate, and one column just to the left. The former houses popular playlists and songs, while the latter contains links that let you perform several actions, including browsing by category, playing tracks purchased from Amazon Music Store, and firing up songs you may have imported using the now-defunct upload feature in the desktop app. You can, of course, search for content by band or song name.</p>
      <p>Searching for Led Zeppelin tracks quickly reveals one of Amazon Prime Music's bigger flaws: holes in the catalog. The service offers tons of Zeppelin tribute band content, but no music performed by the actual band. <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/services-players/19266/spotify">Spotify</a> and Amazon's own standalone Music Unlimited have access to the Zeppelin catalog.</p>

      <p>Amazon Prime Music isn't a total wasteland. You can stream music from popular and not-so-popular artists, such as Bruno Mars and The Dirtbombs, respectively. Still, there are enough holes that you can tell that Prime Music is a limited version of Amazon Music Unlimited. The cynic within me says that it's little more than an enjoyable, functional ad for its more capable big brother.</p>

      <h3>Amazon Prime Music vs. Amazon Music Unlimited</h3>
      <p>Both Prime Music and Music Unlimited offer ad-free listening experiences on several platforms, but they differ in price and library size. Amazon Prime Music is bundled in your $119 per year Prime subscription and offers two million songs; <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/services-players/85493/amazon-music-unlimited">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> is a standalone streaming music service that offers more than 50 million tracks and has a varied price scheme.</p>
      <p>If you don't care much about music, and just want to dabble with it here and there, Prime Music is a decent option. That said, you'll notice that some tracks and albums require you to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited to hear them. For example, you cannot stream Taylor Swift's <i>Reputation</i> with Prime Music.</p>
      <p>Signing up for Amazon Music Unlimited causes the service to replace Amazon Prime Music as your Amazon jukebox, so you needn't worry about launching the wrong streaming service.</p>
      <h3>The Listening Experience</h3>
      <p>Amazon Prime Music is stocked with more than 2,000 themed playlists and stations assembled by the rather pretentiously named collective known as Amazon's Music Experts. I found interesting collections such as One Hit Wonders, Classical for Reading, and the oddly named 50 Great Epic Classic Rock Songs. Each playlist displays a track listing, the total runtime, and its curator. When you find a track or playlist that you like, you can quickly add the music to Your Music Library (a section where your favorite tracks live) by clicking Add to Library.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, if you're looking for <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/services-players/4801/slacker-radio">LiveXLive Powered by Slacker</a>-like channel building to expand your musical horizons, you're out of luck. Amazon Prime Music lets you stream playlists, and select singles and albums, but you cannot construct a station around, say, a hot Cake track. The service also lacks sports, weather, and lifestyle content. It also has lyrics, so you can sing along to tunes even if you don't know the words.</p>
      <p>In testing, the music streamed to my ears through a pair of SteelSeries Arctis 5 headphones was crisp and satisfying. It wasn't a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/services-players/76496/tidal">Tidal</a> level of audio bliss, but most people won't have an issue with the sound quality. The streams carry a 256Kbps bit rate.</p>
      <p>Although Prime Music no longer lets you upload digital audio files, all of your previously uploaded music lives in your account. The imported music and bookmarked Amazon Prime Music tracks exist as a single playlist within Your Music Library. That's not particularly great for organization, but it's not a dealbreaker if you don't mind the content mish-mash.</p>
      <p>Prime Music is relatively barebone. You don't get Tidal's in-depth feature stories or concert tickets or SiriusXM Internet Radio's live radio. In an era when streaming music services are attempting to stand out in a crowded field, Prime Music could do much more.</p>

      <h3>Alexa Compatibility</h3>
      <p>On the upside, Prime Music is compatible with the Amazon Echo family of <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smart-home/92422/the-best-smart-speakers">smart speakers</a>, as well as FireTVs and Fire Tablets. I can command my Echo, using the Alexa voice-control technology, to fire up <i>The Jets' Greatest Hits</i>, and it does so without issue.</p>
      <p>Amazon's smart speakers also deliver behind-the-scenes commentary, dubbed Side-by-Sides. For example, you can ask Alexa to "play Side-by-Side with OneRepublic," and Ryan Tedder comments on songs from the band's newest album. The Chainsmokers, Jason Aldean, Lindsey Stirling, Norah Jones, and Kongos also provide Side-by-Side content.</p>
      <p>In addition, you can use Alexa to search for songs by lyrics, fire up playlists, and search for songs to match your mood. It's really cool to command Alexa to play up-tempo happy music and have the Echo blast the "Pop To Make You Feel Better" playlist. If your Amazon device has a screen, you'll enjoy an additional benefit: lyrics.</p>

      <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
      <p>Amazon has Music apps for both the Android and iOS platforms that perform double duty for both Prime and Unlimited. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access Prime Music; if you're a Music Unlimited subscriber, you can access that service. I tested the Android version on my Google Pixel XL smartphone and found that it closely duplicates the Prime Music browser experience. The app contains copious playlists, useful recommendations, and a music store for making purchases. It displays lyrics, too.</p>
      <p>The mobile app differs from the browser-based version in one significant way: you can use Amazon's Alexa tech to search for songs by lyrics or play tracks. For example, when I asked Alexa for dinner music, it supplied a laid back easy-listening playlist.</p>
      <h3>A Good Prime Addition</h3>
      <p>By itself, Amazon Prime Music isn't a huge selling point, but it's yet another feature under the ever-expanding Prime subscription umbrella, and as such it's a decent extra—especially if you pair it with Amazon hardware. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber who just wants to listen to a few tunes without incurring additional costs—or exploring other apps—Amazon Prime Music is a streaming music service worth at least checking out, since you're already paying for it.</p>
      <p>If, however, you want a feature-packed streaming service that offers live radio, weather updates, and excellent curated stations, PCMag Editors' Choices <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/siriusxm-internet-radio">SiriusXM Internet Radio</a> and Spotify should be at the top of your list.</p>
