      <p>A couple have finally solved the mystery behind a broken plug socket in their home after more than two years.</p>
      <p>Darren Steels and his partner from Hucknall had previously tried plugging things into the socket but could never get it working.</p>
      <p>"We tried to plug things into it," said Darren.</p>
      <p>â€œIt's perfectly placed for vacuuming the stairs, instead of having the cord running across the kitchen floor."</p>
      <p>Eventually, he decided to call in an electrician to try and get it fixed, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/couple-solve-mystery-broken-plug-17278321">Wales Online reports</a>.</p>
      <p>"I was just fed up with it," the 45-year-old said.</p>

      <p>"We had an electrician come round to do some other bits and bobs and I asked him to have a look at it."</p>
      <p>The electrician confirmed there was no power connected to the socket and soon uncovered the truth - the plug socket was actually a secret safe.</p>
      <p>"He prised it open, and it came away from the wall," Darren said.</p>
      <p>"There was just dust, fluff and a dead spider in it."</p>
      <p>He shared a video of the discovery online, which has been liked more than 50,000 times on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Thats both hilarious and sort of James Bond," one person commented.</p>
      <p>"I always wanted one of those as a kid," another added.</p>
