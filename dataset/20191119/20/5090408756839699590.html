      </ul>
      <p>Heading into Week 12, some big games lie ahead in the NFL.</p>
      <p>There are big divisional games: the Texans and Colts, fighting for the AFC South; the Titans and Jaguars, only two games out of the division lead; the Panthers and Saints, fighting for a wild card and a first-round bye, respectively.</p>
      <p>There are big conference games: the Seahawks and Eagles, fighting for their division leads and a playoff spot; the 49ers and Packers are fighting to be considered true contenders.</p>
      <p>The Patriots and Cowboys also play a big non-conference game. The Patriots haven’t exactly passed the sniff test the last two weeks while playing two solid teams in the Ravens and Eagles. Meanwhile, the Cowboys could pick up their best win of the season by beating the Patriots in Foxborough.</p>
      <p>As we head to the three-quarter mark of the NFL season, here’s where all 32 teams stand.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>32. Washington Redskins</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 1-9</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 30th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Jets, 34-17</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Detroit Lions</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Dwayne Haskins broke a streak of 15 quarters without a passing touchdown by throwing two in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-dwayne-haskins-pass-to-terry-mclaurin-holding-penalty-2019-11">his best play of the day</a> didn’t count because of a holding penalty. Baby steps in Washington.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>31. Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd405353afd3731964283f9.png"/>
        <figcaption>Zac Taylor.<cite>Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 0-10</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 32nd</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Raiders, 17-10</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Winless through 10 games, the first-year head coach is likely starting to get anxious about getting his first win before the end of the season. Thankfully, with games against the Browns, Jets, and Dolphins still left on the schedule, all hope is not yet lost.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>30. New York Giants</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 2-8</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 31st</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Bye</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Chicago Bears</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Giants would love to win a few more games down the stretch, but to do so, they’ll need to be healthy. Saquon Barkley, Sterling Shepard, and Evan Engram are all battling various ailments, leaving Daniel Jones with little support.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>29. Miami Dolphins</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd4056a3afd373206283d13.png"/>

      <p><b>Record</b>: 2-8</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 28th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Bills, 37-20</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Cleveland Browns</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: While the Dolphins have been planning for next year all season, the front office is not waiting until the draft to lock in talent for their next campaign, signing wide receiver Allen Hurns to a two-year, $8 million extension this week.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>28. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 3-7</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 24th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Saints, 34-17</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Atlanta Falcons</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Jameis Winston’s turnover issues have continued. He threw four more interceptions on Sunday, bringing him to 13 in the last five weeks and 19 on the season, second-most in NFL history through 10 games.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>27. New York Jets</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd2c3143afd37329f094e48.png"/>
        <figcaption>Ryan Griffin.<cite>Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 3-7</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 29th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Redskins, 34-17</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Oakland Raiders</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Jets tight end Ryan Griffin has finished as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/waiver-wire-week-12-pick-ups-2019-11">the top player at his position in fantasy</a> in two of the past four weeks. If you need a spark for your push for the fantasy playoffs, he could be your man.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>26. Denver Broncos</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 3-7</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 26th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Vikings, 27-23</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Buffalo Bills</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Broncos have lost four games this season after leading in the fourth quarter. The latest was the most brutal: blowing a 20-point second-half lead over the Vikings.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>25. Detroit Lions</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd2c07d3afd372e4d76623a.png"/>
        <figcaption>Bo Scarbrough.<cite>Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 3-6-1</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 22nd</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Cowboys, 35-27</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Washington Redskins</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: It’s been a tough stretch for the Detroit Lions, who have now lost six of their past seven games. Running back <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/waiver-wire-week-12-pick-ups-2019-11">Bo Scarbrough has the chance to be a bright spot</a> for the Lions this week after getting his first start last Sunday thanks to an injured backfield. He’ll look to improve on his 55 yards on 14 carries this week at Washington.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>24. Chicago Bears</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 4-6</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 21st</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Rams, 17-7</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. New York Giants</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Bears pulled Mitch Trubisky for Chase Daniel in Week 11 during another ugly performance for the third-year QB. The Bears said it was for a hip injury, but with Trubisky struggling, it may be best to leave him on the sideline for a few more weeks.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>23. Arizona Cardinals</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 3-7-1</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 25th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the 49ers, 36-26</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: Bye</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Fantasy football players have been frustrated by a lack of news surrounding standout running back David Johnson, who has gotten just five carries in the past two weeks for Arizona. Newly acquired running back Kenyan Drake appears to have taken over the top spot in the Cardinals offense.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>22. Atlanta Falcons</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 3-7</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 27th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Panthers, 29-3</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: With two straight wins over potential playoff teams in their division, the Falcons have the chance to play spoiler in the NFC. It’s worth asking, though, where this tenacity was over the first eight weeks of the season.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>21. Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd405fe7eece53fe6694527.png"/>
        <figcaption>Nick Foles.<cite>Thomas J. Russo-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 4-6</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 19th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Colts, 33-13</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Tennessee Titans</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Nick Foles’ return to the Jaguars wasn’t enough to earn a win against Tennessee on Sunday. At 4-6, Jacksonville is at the bottom of the AFC South standings, but still sitting just two games off the division lead.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>20. Tennessee Titans</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 5-5</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 18th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Bye</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Have we seen the end of Marcus Mariota with the Titans? Ryan Tannehill has been statistically superior in almost every category, and the team has won three of four games with Tannehill operating the offense.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>19. Los Angeles Chargers</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd406eb7eece542915622f4.png"/>
        <figcaption>Philip Rivers.<cite>Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 4-7</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 20th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Chiefs, 24-17</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: Bye</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Despite their 4-7 record, the Chargers have been competitive in every game they’ve played this season, with none of their losses coming by more than a touchdown. It seems that every week, Philip Rivers has a chance in the fourth quarter to mount a game-winning drive, and every week the Chargers come up just a little short.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>18. Cleveland Browns</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 4-6</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 23rd</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Steelers, 21-7</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Miami Dolphins</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Browns have won three straight, and their schedule is only getting easier as they go forward. Of course, any playoff push will come without defensive anchor Myles Garrett, who is suspended for his part in the ugly Browns-Steelers altercation.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>17. Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 5-5</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 12th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Browns, 21-7</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Cincinnati Bengals</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Pittsburgh offensive lineman <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/myles-garrett-david-decastro-steelers-browns-fight-mason-rudolph-2019-11">David DeCastro might be the only person that came out of Thursday night’s brawl</a> between the Steelers and Browns looking good. DeCastro earned credit from both sides of the fight for playing the role of peacemaker amidst the chaos.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>16. Carolina Panthers</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 5-5</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 13th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Falcons, 29-3</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at New Orleans Saints</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Panthers are slumping at the wrong time, losing three of their last four. Not coincidentally, Kyle Allen has thrown nine interceptions during that stretch, including some brutal red-zone picks in Week 11.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>15. Oakland Raiders</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd406967eece541a5023816.png"/>
        <figcaption>Jon Gruden.<cite>Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 6-4</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 16th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Bengals, 17-10</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at New York Jets</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: With a win this week over the Jets, the Raiders could head into their Week 13 matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs with first place in the AFC West hanging in the balance. Not bad for a team that looked like a nightmare heading into the season.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>14. Philadelphia Eagles</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 5-5</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 15th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Patriots, 17-10</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Seattle Seahawks</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Eagles defense is rounding into form, but it comes as the offense is falling apart. Carson Wentz hasn’t been impressive this season, but he has little help when key players like Alshon Jeffery, DeSean Jackson, and Jordan Howard are out, as they were in Week 11.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>13. Los Angeles Rams</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 6-4</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 17th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Bears, 17-7</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Baltimore Ravens</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Rams escaped with a win on Sunday night, but Los Angeles still has plenty of problems that need to be addressed if they hope to make it back to the postseason this year. Hopefully the looming return of wide receiver Brandin Cooks can kickstart the offense a bit this weekend against the Ravens.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>12. Indianapolis Colts</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 6-4</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 11th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Jaguars, 33-13</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at Houston Texans</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Colts will once again turn to a backup on offense, as starting running back Marlon Mack fractured his hand and is out indefinitely. Backup running back Jonathan Williams filled in admirably in Week 11 with 147 total yards on 14 touches.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>11. Houston Texans</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd407287eece542e77a8658.png"/>
        <figcaption>Deshaun Watson.<cite>Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 6-4</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 8th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Lost to the Ravens, 41-7</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Indianapolis Colts</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Deshaun Watson and the Texans took a hit on Sunday when they were run off the field by Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. Heading into Week 11, Texans-Ravens looked like the best game on the schedule, but it didn’t take long for Baltimore to prove they were a cut above the competition.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>10. Buffalo Bills</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 7-3</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 10th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Dolphins, 37-20</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: vs. Denver Broncos</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The Josh Allen-John Brown connection was in full force in Week 11. Brown had 137 yards and 2 touchdowns, the longest of which came on a 40-yard pass.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>9. Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd407667eece543a170fd59.png"/>
        <figcaption>Harrison Butker.<cite>Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 7-4</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 9th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Chargers, 24-17</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: Bye</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: The wildest highlight from the Chiefs trip to Mexico City to play the Chargers came before kickoff, when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chiefs-kicker-70-yard-field-goal-mexico-city-2019-11">Kansas City kicker Harrison Butker drilled a 70-yard field goal during pre-game warmups</a>. Butker wouldn’t need a kick that impressive when the game finally began, but he did have a perfect day through the uprights on Monday.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>8. Dallas Cowboys</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.sg/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 6-4</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 14th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Lions, 35-27</p>
      <p><b>Week 12 opponent</b>: at New England Patriots</p>
      <p><b>One thing to know</b>: Dak Prescott has been on fire the last two weeks, throwing for over 700 yards and 6 touchdowns. The Cowboys should look to attack through the air more, especially with Ezekiel Elliott running for fewer than 50 yards and fewer than three yards per carry in each of the last two games.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>7. Minnesota Vikings</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dd407987eece543f42ed854.png"/>
        <figcaption>Kirk Cousins.<cite>Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Record</b>: 8-3</p>
      <p><b>Last week</b>: 7th</p>
      <p><b>Week 11 result</b>: Beat the Broncos, 27-23</p>
