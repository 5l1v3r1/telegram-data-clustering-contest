      <p>Not to brag, but I recently had the pleasure of visiting <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/30/18646445/disneyland-star-wars-land-build-custom-lightsaber-price-review-savis-galaxys-edge">Galaxy’s Edge</a> — Disneyland’s Star Wars theme park — on my honeymoon. I built a $215 lightsaber, and it was one of the coolest things I’ve ever been suckered into spending money on. I knew this was going to be the premier Star Wars land experience for me, and I wasn’t disappointed.</p>
      <p>But what I didn’t expect was that I would be able to build an exact replica of my personal saber in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/40381"><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i></a>.</p>
      <p>When I first started my adventure in <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, the game impressed me with its specific, detailed lightsaber animations for blocking, attacking, and holstering — even if my weapon’s actual design didn’t speak to me.</p>

      <p>But during my adventures with hero Cal Kestis, I discover dozens of chests on each planet. Some of them let me color my adorable droid or swap out which poncho I’m wearing. But others include lightsaber parts that allow me to customize how my lightsaber itself looks.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until a few hours in that I saw a piece that looked very familiar to me. My personal lightsaber abandons the sleek steel of the Jedi and Sith. Instead, it’s made of metal and wood fused together, with beautiful patterns worked into the hilt. I found some of these exact parts in <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, and started to customize Cal’s lightsaber to try to match my own as closely as possible.</p>
      <p>It took me a little bit of time to gather all the parts, but the result was perfect. Not only had I created my own lightsaber; I’d collected all the different pieces of other potential Galaxy’s Edge sabers. <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> is now my own lightsaber test environment, where I can see what I want before going back to Disneyland and surely buying another saber in a few years.</p>
      <p>[<b>Warning:</b> There are some small lightsaber customization spoilers below, as well as an image of a late-game saber upgrade.]</p>

      <p>For most of my time with <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>, there was one major discrepancy between my personal saber and Cal’s. The lightsaber I crafted at Savi’s Workshop features a purple blade, but blue and green were my only options for most of <i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i>’s campaign. As someone with a nontraditional lightsaber color of choice, it was a bit frustrating — especially considering I could’ve gone with an <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=polygon&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fstar-wars-jedi-fallen-order-pre-order-bonus%2Fbw631rl4dwk3%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab">orange lightsaber immediately</a> with a pre-order.</p>

      <p>However, by game’s end, my lightsaber is perfect, in-game and out. Even the color on the top of my DualShock 4 represents my blade’s unique purple hue. You can see the physical lightsaber I built above, and the in-game version below:</p>

      <p>It’s these kinds of small details, the sort of thing that will only be noticed by the most hardcore fans — or maybe just those willing to spend a lot of money on Star Wars — that makes that universe so enjoyable to visit. It all fits together, sometimes in surprising ways. Just like my lightsaber.</p>
