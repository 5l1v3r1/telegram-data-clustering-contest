      <blockquote>"The DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] also reported that the death of ISIS [IS] leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi… would likely have little effect on ISIS's ability to reconstitute," the report, issued by the Operation Inherent Resolve Lead Inspector General’s office, said.</blockquote>
      <p>The report added that, according to the DIA, Daesh* "postured to withstand" the death of Baghdadi and probably will maintain continuity of operations.</p>
      <p>On 26 October, Baghdadi <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077208499-no-one-seems-to-know-how-trump-learned-that-daesh-chief-baghdadi-died-a-crying-death/">was killed in a US military raid</a> near the Syrian town of Idlib. The Islamic State said its new leader is Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi - a nom de guerre that appears to depict him as a member of the Quraysh tribe and descendant of the Islamic prophet Mohammed.</p>
      <p>The terror leader’s immediate likely successor, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, was killed in a US airstrike, according to US officials.</p>
