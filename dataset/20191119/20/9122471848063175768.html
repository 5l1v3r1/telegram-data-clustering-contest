      <h1>MLB Commissioner Addresses The Houston Astros Investigation</h1>

      <p>The biggest story involving Major League Baseball is the ongoing investigation into the Houston Astros, who are accused of stealing signs electronically.</p>
      <p>Houston is alleged to<a href="https://theathletic.com/1363451/2019/11/12/the-astros-stole-signs-electronically-in-2017-part-of-a-much-broader-issue-for-major-league-baseball/"> have used a camera</a>, installed in center field, to capture pitch signs. The information was then relayed back to the dugout and eventually to the hitter at-bat.</p>
      <p>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred was asked about the brewing scandal as the annual owners’ meetings get underway.</p>
      <p>In his response, he stressed looking into the matter as thoroughly as possible and confirmed he could come down hard with a potential punishment.</p>

      <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/astros/article/MLB-told-video-monitors-to-listen-for-Astros-14844792.php">the <i>Houston Chronicle</i> reported</a> that MLB told video monitors at Minute Maid Park in Houston to listen for “banging sounds” coming from the Astros’ dugout. During the 2017 World Series, the Astros are accused of alerting hitters to certain forthcoming pitches by banging on trash cans.</p>
      <p>It seems that every week, new accusations emerge and new evidence of the Astros possibly cheating is uncovered.</p>
      <p>We’ve never seen an imbroglio quite like this in baseball before, so there’s no real precedent for how Houston might be punished.</p>
