      <p>CYPRESS HILLS, Brooklyn (WABC) -- NYPD officers on routine patrol found themselves in the middle of a hail of bullets in Brooklyn early Thursday, prompting a huge response.</p>
      <p>The gunfire erupted just before 2 a.m. after a dispute outside a delicatessen in near Nichols Avenue and Fulton Street in Cypress Hills, and at least one person is in police custody.</p>
      <p>Officers from the 75th Precinct arrived on the scene to find bullets whizzing by from the corner bodega.</p>
      <p>At first they thought someone might be shooting at them, which prompted a big response from the NYPD including armored vehicles, police in full tactical gear and an NYPD helicopter.</p>

      <p>Investigators now believe this had something to do with a prior argument at the deli, and that someone may have threatened to come back and shoot the place up.</p>
      <p>Video from the scene shows a man in handcuffs being taken into custody.</p>
      <p>A parked SUV and other vehicles were damaged in the barrage of bullets, with shattered windows and blown out tires.</p>
      <p>"It's bad," said Juan Pineo, whose car was damaged. "The tire got hit. The other guy got the window blown out. That's a lot more expensive to fix. These officers are out here every day. Thank God nobody was hurt."</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>
