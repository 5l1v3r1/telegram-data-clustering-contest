      <p>After her debut Bollywood film ‘October’ with Varun Dhawan, British actress, Banita Sandhu has been away from the spotlight. However, it seems Sandhu has bagged a biggie in the shape of Shoojit Sircar’s ‘Udham Singh’ starring Vicky Kaushal.</p>
      <p>Talking about her return, Sandhu was cited in <i>Deccan Chronicle</i>, “I am in Udham Singh. We shot for it in Punjab. Vicky Kaushal is amazing and it was great to be back working with the October team again.”</p>
      <p>During her time away, Sandhu completed the Tamil version of Sandeep Vanga’s ‘Arjun Reddy’. About this, she said, “I haven’t watched the final film yet, so I wouldn’t be able to say how my role has shaped up. But Vikram sir (legendary Tamil actor Vikram whose son Dhruv made his debut in Adithya Varma) and I worked to give my character more agency and autonomy in the film. I hope that gets translated on screen.”</p>
