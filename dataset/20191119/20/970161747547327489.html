      <p>The date of the first eviction has not yet been revealed but judging by previous seasons, it may be around the fortnight mark.</p>
      <p>Last year saw Noel Edmonds become the first campmate to be given the boot on day 13, while the series prior saw Shappi Khorsandi evicted within the same timeframe.</p>
