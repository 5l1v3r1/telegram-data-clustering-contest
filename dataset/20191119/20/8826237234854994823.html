      <h1>Activists Aim to Change NC Law Allowing People to Do Anything They Want to Opossums for 5 Days Each Year</h1>

      <p>(RALEIGH, N.C.) — A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called “opossum dropping.”</p>
      <p>The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight.</p>
      <p>The Raleigh <i>News &amp; Observer</i> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article237510559.html">reported Monday</a> that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years.</p>
      <p>Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year.</p>
      <p>The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.</p>
