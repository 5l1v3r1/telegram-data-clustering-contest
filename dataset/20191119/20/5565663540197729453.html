      <p>Churches are cranking up pressure for national dialogue, with the Zimbabwe Heads of Christian Denominations (ZHOCD) setting up December 13 for the launch of the National Convergence Platform (NCP).<br/><br/>NCP is a platform which brings together non-political actors to the dialogue series to try to find a lasting solution to the country's array of problems ranging from economics to politics.<br/><br/>In a statement yesterday, ZHOCD secretary-general Kenneth Mtata said the NCP seeks to provide space to co-ordinate different national dialogue initiatives among non-political actors.<br/><br/>He said the platform will allow for coherence among non-political actors who believe that national dialogue is the only sustainable solution to Zimbabwe's challenges.<br/><br/>"Explorations are at an advanced stage to have one eminent African to speak at the launch in addition to the colourful array of our local speakers," Mtata said.<br/><br/>"Such convergence is a huge breakthrough considering there were many voices talking about the national dialogue without common position."<br/><br/>Churches have been in the forefront of pushing for the national dialogue to address the country's economic and political woes.<br/><br/>The churches have also been pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and opposition leader Nelson Chamisa to come to the negotiating table, but their efforts have repeatedly hit a brick wall.<br/><br/>Most people believe dialogue between Mnangagwa and Chamisa will reverse the country's collapsing economy.<br/><br/>Mtata also said consultations for national dialogue by non-political actors were continuing largely in the different regions, building up to the launch date.<br/><br/>"The working group has asked the ZHOCD to convene the platform. The NCP will allow for coherence among non-political actors.<br/><br/>The NCP has previously been mired in much controversy with some quarters inferring that the initiative had been hijacked for political outcomes, resulting in delays in its implementation.<br/><br/>But Mtata said: "It has been given a new focus."</p>
