        <b>RUSSIA face being banned from Euro 2020 due to alleged inconsistencies in anti-doping data - which could incredibly lead to Scotland taking their place.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world's largest nation are also at risk of being suspended from <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4974731/rangers-alfredo-morelos-st-etienne/">next summer's</a> Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> faced off against Russia twice in their Euro qualifying group, with the Russians winning both 2-1 and 4-0 respectively.</p>
      <p>Russia are one of 12 host countries for next summer's Euro 2020 tournament - which kicks off on June 12.</p>
      <p>The St Petersburg Stadium will be used for three Group B matches and a quarter-final on July 3.</p>
      <p>Russia's potential punishment comes as the country's anti-doping agency is expected to be declared non-compliant when the World Anti-Doping Agency's executive committee meet on December 9 to discuss the issue.</p>

      <p>The data in question comes from January 2012 to August 2015 and was obtained by WADA in January.</p>
      <p>A statement released by WADA on Monday read: "The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirms that WADA's independent Compliance Review Committee (CRC) met yesterday, 17 November, to consider a report from the Agency's Intelligence and Investigations Department (I&amp;I) and independent forensic experts and, accordingly, to discuss the ongoing compliance procedure brought against the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</p>
      <p>'In line with the process, the CRC will now bring a formal recommendation to the WADA executive committee (ExCo), under the chairmanship of WADA President Sir Craig Reedie whose term of office runs until December 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>"The ExCo is scheduled to meet on 9 December to discuss the recommendation."</p>
      <p>If the executive agrees with the findings, Russia could be banned from participating in major sporting events and have hosting rights removed.</p>
      <p>Should Russia appeal, the case would be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <h3>Will Scotland take Russia's place at Euro 2020?</h3>
      <p>It is not clear exactly how Uefa would handle a sanction handed out to Russia by WADA.</p>
      <p>In the latest edition of their disciplinary regulations on their <a href="https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/UEFACompDisCases/02/60/83/56/2608356_DOWNLOAD.pdf">website</a>, Uefa simply state they will recognise the authority of another sporting body in relation to doping.</p>
      <p>It says: "In so far as they are compatible with Uefa's rules, measures taken by a government body or another sporting body in relation to doping are recognised by Uefa."</p>
      <p>There is no further information as to whether Uefa would actually enforce the sanction however.</p>
      <p>And while it could be assumed Scotland could take Russia's place if they finish third in Group I, Uefa haven't stated who would replace them in the tournament.</p>
