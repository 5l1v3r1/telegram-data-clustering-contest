      <p>The director recently uploaded an Instagram post that stated: </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Directors always want more budget to work with. It isn't because they're greedy but because they want to make more art with more freedom. There are many instances where the MV making costs more than the song. Whether or not what the director wants to portray in the music, it's nice to make what I envision without budget limitations. Please look up Magic Island by TXT on Youtube. Thank you for letting me use a lot of money to make this." </i>
