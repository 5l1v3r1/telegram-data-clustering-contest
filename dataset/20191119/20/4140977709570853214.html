          <p>As it turns out it will be a battle between two arch-rivals India and Pakistan when the two teams lock horns in the 1<sup>st</sup> semi-final of the ACC Emerging Asia Cup. Both teams have played some competitive cricket in the tournament so far and will look to play out of their skins in the much-awaited contest of the tournament.</p>
          <p>India managed to win a couple of matches but lost their match against home team Bangladesh and will look to make a comeback in the must-win clash. On the flip side, Pakistan managed to win all their 3 previous matches which made things pretty easy in the end for them. Like always it will be a huge game given the fact that it is an India Pakistan match albeit in an emerging tournament.</p>
          <h3>PAK-ET vs IND-ET Pitch Conditions</h3>
          <p>The surface at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium has been unpredictable On occasions it has been a run-fest here but on certain occasions, small scores have also been defended by teams. However, in the last few matches, it has been a batting-friendly wicket with scores of more than 250 being chased down 3 times in the last 5 occasions. The team winning the toss might be tempted to bat first given the fact that it is a knockout clash.</p>

                            <p>B Sharath, Arman Jaffer</p>
                            <h3>PAK-ET vs IND-ET Dream 11 Wicket-keeper</h3>
                            <p><b>B Sharath</b> is a good wicket-keeper batsman and has done well in the limited opportunities he has got so far. In 12 List A matches, Bharath has scored 212 runs at an average of 35. He has also been in good form in the tournament and has got his side off to a good start on most occasions.</p>
                            <p><b>Rohail Nazir</b> has been an integral part of the Pakistan youth team and has looked in great shape in the tournament. He has scored 154 runs in 3 innings and will look to continue his good work in the must-win clash.</p>
                            <h3>PAK-ET vs IND-ET Dream 11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p><b>Arman Jaffer</b> has played limited U 23 cricket but in the CK Nayudu tournament last year he amassed 778 runs in the competition. In this tournament, the free-flowing batsman scored a century against Bangladesh which went in a losing cause and also scored 51 against Nepal.</p>
                            <p><b>Saud Shakeel</b> will be the first Pakistani pick in this segment. He has performed well for Pakistan and scored a fluent 31 against Afghanistan in the previous encounter.</p>
                            <p><b>Chinmay Sutar</b> will be the last player in this segment. He has been an impressive run-scorer for India. Sutar smashed a sensational century against Hong Kong earlier in the tournament</p>
                            <h3>PAK-ET vs IND-ET Dream 11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p><b>Khushdil Shah</b> will be the first pick in this segment especially due to his form in the recent past. He has bagged 7 wickets in the tournament and also scored a half-century. There is certainly no doubt about his selection.</p>
                            <p><b>Amad Butt</b> is also an impressive player for Pakistan and has scored freely in the competition so far. He has bagged just two wickets but lends the ideal balance to the Pakistan team.</p>
                            <p><b>Saurabh Dubey</b> will be the last pick in this segment due to his exceptional all-round abilities. He has been impressive in the competition and will look to provide a match-winning performance in the all-important clash.</p>
                            <h3>IND-ET vs NEP-ET Dream 11 Bowlers</h3>
                            <p><b>Shivam Mavi</b>– He had a good time during his U 19 days and hasn’t played too much of List and U 23 cricket. He has done a reasonable job in the competition and will look to make his presence felt in the all-important semi-final.</p>
                            <p>Other 2 Bowlers that we will be including in our squad is <b>U Khan </b>from Pakistan and <b>V Gupta </b>from India.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Arman Jaffer will be our captain today given his stupendous run in the competition. B Sharath could be a good option as a vice-captain material as he has a good record in his brief List A career so far.</p>
