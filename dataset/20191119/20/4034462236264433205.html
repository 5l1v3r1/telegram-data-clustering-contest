      <h1>2020 Cadillac CT5-V More Powerful Than Originally Claimed</h1>
      <h2>Any extra hp is welcomed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:30:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, Cadillac unveiled the first photos and specs of its all-new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/ct5-v">2020 CT5-V</a>, the supposed successor to the now <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/cadillac-terminates-what-once-was-its-most-badass-model">discontinued CTS-V</a>. Although the CT5-V (and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/ct5">CT5</a>) are a bit smaller than the CTS, it retains the rear-wheel-drive platform and gains bolder styling inside and out. However, output was not as expected. Cadillac originally estimated the 2020 CT5-V to produce 355 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque from its twin-turbo 3.0-liter V6, which is paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="http://cadillacsociety.com/2019/11/18/cadillac-ct5-v-to-make-more-power-and-torque-than-estimated/">Cadillac Society</a>, those power figures are slightly down in reality. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has instead rated the CT5-V with an additional five horsepower and pound-feet of torque for a total of 360 hp and 405 lb-ft.</p>

      <p>It may not be all that much, but then there's this: the SAE figures have that maximum power and torque being available from 200 rpm and 50-400 rpm lower in the rev band, respectively. Previously, Cadillac had those max power figures pegged from 5,600 rpm and 2,400 to 4,400 rpm. We don't know whether Cadillac will officially adjust its own figures based on what the SAE claims, but it's good to know the new CT5-V has a bit more juice than initially stated.</p>
      <p>However, it's worth remembering that the CT5-V will not be the most powerful CT5 on the market.</p>

      <p>In the very near future, Cadillac is slated to unveil the so-called <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/there-s-big-news-about-the-upcoming-cadillac-ct5-v-blackwing">CT5-V Blackwing</a> with power sourced from a 6.2-liter LT4 supercharged V8, the very same engine that powers the outgoing <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-z06">C7 Corvette Z06</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/cadillac/cts-v">CTS-V</a>. This means at least 640 horsepower but it's possible this will reach as high as 670 ponies. And yes, a six-speed manual is a rumored option for those who want to row their own gears. For now, none of this is confirmed, although we would not be surprised to hear all of the above becoming a reality.</p>
