      <h1>Disney World guests search for grieving strangers who gave heartbreaking gift</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:26:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">Marisa Dellatto</a></address>
      <p>A mom shared a heartbreaking story on Facebook this week about her daughter’s encounter with a grieving couple at Disney World in the hopes of finding them.</p>
      <p>Kara and Kyle Geiselman, a North Andover, Massachusetts couple, brought their brood of four on a trip over Halloween to the Florida theme park.</p>
      <p>While they were in Hollywood Studios, 5-year-old Belle, one of their youngest daughters, was chasing after Kyle and almost ran into a couple, according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156270433072003&amp;set=a.33163847002&amp;type=3">a viral Facebook post shared by Kara</a>. He apologized to the strangers “for her carelessness.”</p>
      <p>Then, the woman asked Kyle, 41, if his daughter liked gold and if they could give her something. He said yes.</p>
      <p>“The couple proceeds to tell Kyle how they were at [Hollywood Studios] marking the one-year anniversary of their daughter’s Make-a-Wish trip,” Kara’s post continued. “On their initial trip, they had bought 2 gold Mickey Mouse rings, one for their daughter and one to gift to a child who in their words, ‘was adorable like their little girl.’ ”</p>
      <p>Kyle was stunned and at a loss for words. Though he could only mutter a “thank you” in the moment, he wanted to tell them “so much, that he was sorry for their insurmountable loss and about our own little warrior,” Kara posted.</p>
      <p>“I can only imagine how hard it was for them to be back without their daughter,” Kyle <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/little-girl-gifted-gold-ring-grieving-parents-disney-t167333">told the “Today” show</a>. “I wanted to know more, but I didn’t want to make it any more difficult for them.”</p>
      <p>The grieving couple never got to find out how perfect their gift to Belle was. Kyle told “Today” that Belle, a twin, was born prematurely at 30 weeks, and had feeding tubes for the first 18 months of her life. She spent 126 days in the NICU, and suffered from chronic lung disease, <a href="https://turnto10.com/news/local/family-hopes-to-connect-with-couple-that-gave-child-mickey-mouse-ring-in-disney?fbclid=IwAR1SupYqCTftfZOuLFugbIN_xzZcDMMGWdzmG3Ukd3u7D6JBjh6z4frSNmg">reported NBC10</a>.</p>
      <p>“When Belle was 5 days old, her doctors were like, ‘We don’t know if she is going to live,’” Kyle said in the interview. “She actually almost died.”</p>
      <p>“They didn’t know that we were back at the place where our daughter surprised us all and starting eating by mouth for the first time at 18 months old,” Kara wrote in the Facebook post. “Or that this trip was the first time she traveled to Disney without needing a feeding tube for nourishment or an Oxygen mask on the flight.”</p>
      <p>Floored with the kindness of the strangers, Kyle and Kara are spreading their story in hopes of finding them and giving them a proper thank you.</p>
      <p>“This little gold Mickey Mouse ring will forever be kept as a priceless gift and always cherished,” Kara posted.</p>
