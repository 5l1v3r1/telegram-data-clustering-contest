      <h1>WT:Social is a New Social Network From WikiTribune</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:55:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>WT:Social is a <a href="https://wt.social/">new social network</a> from Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia. He promises it will never sell user data and rely on donors rather than ads (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50460243">via</a> <i>BBC</i>).</p>
      <h3>WT:Social</h3>
      <p>When you first sign up you’ll be put on a waiting list and asked to invite others, or you can sign up for a subscription. It costs US$13/mo or US$100/year.</p>
      <blockquote>We will empower you to make your own choices about what content you are served, and to directly edit misleading headlines, or flag problem posts. We will foster an environment where bad actors are removed because it is right, not because it suddenly affects our bottom-line.</blockquote>
      <p>WT:Social will be focused on news and members will be asked to edit misleading headlines. Articles will be shared in a timeline that presents content by the newest stuff first, rather than algorithmically-sorted like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
