        <b>BUNGLING Greens tabled plans to slap firms with rates bills greater than the entire world’s wealth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party suggested an amendment to an <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4768372/nicola-sturgeon-first-minister-greens-msp-target/">SNP</a> overhaul which would see demands double for every £50,000 rise in rateable value above £60,000.</p>

      <p>MSP Andy Wightman’s call would mean large high-street premises being hit by annual charges running into trillions of pounds.</p>
      <p>Even bigger properties would be hit by astronomical bills with numbers containing more than 20 digits.</p>
      <p>Tonight a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/politics/4958433/list-scottish-candidates-snp-conservatives-labour-lib-dems-general-election/">Holyrood</a> insider said: “It’s simple maths. If you double a number, then keep on doubling, the amount gets very, very big - very, very quickly.</p>
      <p>“This is school-level arithmetic and you wonder how they got this so wrong.”</p>
      <p>Economist David Eiser, from Strathclyde University, added: “If you have an exponentially increasing marginal tax rate, without any ceiling, it will lead to unimaginably high average tax rates.”</p>
      <p>Figures crunched by tax experts show the annual bill for Debenhams at Aberdeen’s Trinity Centre — which has a rateable value of £800,000 - would go from £412,800 to £590million.</p>

      <p>Primark on Glasgow’s Argyle Street — rated at £1.2million — would see its charge go up from £614,040 to £134billion.</p>
      <p>And Marks &amp; Spencer on Edinburgh’s Princes Street — which has an even higher value of £1.69million — would face a rise from £869,460 to an eye-watering £137trillion.</p>
      <p>Red-faced Greens bosses were alerted to the apparent bungle over the weekend.</p>
      <p>On Monday, they tabled a replacement amendment which removes the hike.</p>
      <p>But the new text leaves the speed by which the rates bills rise at the discretion of ministers.</p>
      <p>And the plans still include a proposal to allow councils to slap extra charges on businesses.</p>
      <p>David Lonsdale, from the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: “The pantomime season has come early with these bungled and ill-thought out plans for stratospheric hikes in business rates.</p>
      <p>“Whilst back-tracking on this particular idea, the Greens still seem to want to stick to the plotline and play the panto villain with their other proposal to let councils levy an extra tax on top of the existing business rate.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully MSPs will firmly reject such nonsense and begin to tackle the existing onerous burden, as business rates are at a 20-year high.”</p>
      <p>Tonight Andy Wightman said: “There was an error in the wording of the original draft which has been corrected. This amendment would be a progressive measure which would make the system fairer.”</p>
