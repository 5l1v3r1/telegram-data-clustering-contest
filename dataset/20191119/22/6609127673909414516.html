        <b>A CALLOUS dealer backed a TRNSMT festival tribute to tragic teen Chelsea Bruce - days after she died from taking his drugs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lewis Reid, 22, joined the schoolgirl’s pals in a social media bid for a song dedication from Catfish and the Bottlemen.</p>

      <p>But earlier in the same week in July the brute had supplied the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4972879/drug-dealer-lewis-reid-guilty-chealsea-bruce-codey-brown/">ecstasy that killed her</a>.</p>
      <p>Reid - who uses the nickname Gucci - used Twitter to help spread a plea from Chelsea’s cousin to get the rockers to dedicate a song to her at Glasgow’s TRNSMT.</p>
      <p>But he also used social media to ply his evil trade - and even mocked cops with a crude “F*** the CID” spelled out in white powder.</p>
      <p>A source said: “It’s sickening to think he was acting like a concerned pal when in reality he had supplied the drugs that ended up killing Chelsea.”</p>
      <p>On Monday at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Reid - nicknamed Gucci - admitted 22 offences between August 2018 and July.</p>
      <p>The court heard harrowing details of Chelsea’s last moments after four teens clubbed together <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4968210/lewis-reid-chelsea-bruce-codey-robson/">to buy MDMA from Reid</a>.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Ruaraidh Ferguson told how three youngsters including Chelsea <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4462729/glasgow-schoolgirl-died-ecstasy-party-spingburn/">took it at a party</a> in Springburn, Glasgow.</p>

      <p>Worried friends said she began to “shake and sweat so much her hair was wet”.</p>
      <p>They took her outside to cool down but she began “gasping for air”, had a fit and passed out. She died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.</p>
      <p>Two lads, aged 16 and 18, also taken to hospital, identified Reid as the dealer.</p>
      <p>He warned on Snapchat: “If anyone is saying I sold Chelsea Bruce anything text or Snapchat me.”</p>
      <p>The court heard Reid - who was not charged with supplying Chelsea - boasted to cops: “I’ve dealt five kilos of this stuff and not one person has died yet.”</p>

      <p>He admitted 22 offences between August 2018 and July, including possessing cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine and missing court.</p>
      <p>Reid pled guilty to dangerous driving after ex-girlfriend <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4945992/kilmarnock-codey-robson-boyfriend-guilty-car/">Codey Brown</a> broke her wrist when he drove off as she leaned in a car window during a row.</p>
      <p>Tragic Codey was found dead aged 18 seven months later in a Kilmarnock park in March.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Elizabeth McFarlane told the Barlinnie lag, who has revenge porn and drug dealing convictions: “I am considering sending you to the High Court for sentence. I’m not sure my powers are enough.”</p>
      <p>During Chelsea’s funeral service, Rev Brian Casey said Springburn was in mourning following the young schoolgirl’s death. The minister is also the school chaplain at Springburn Academy.</p>
      <p>He said: “Friends, Today Springburn is in mourning. We are shocked, We are in pain and we are broken.</p>
      <p>“We have stopped and gathered here today to join together in our brokenness.</p>
      <p>“We have lost one of our brightest and definitely one of our best.</p>
      <p>“Anytime I saw Chelsea, the one thing that stood out was her wide smile. From ear to ear.”</p>
