      <p>There are serious traffic delays on the M1 this morning, after a grass fire broke out in the middle of the motorway.</p>
      <p>It’s understood a cigarette butt might be to blame, after vegetation lit up between north and southbound lanes around 8.00am.</p>
      <p>Motorists report the blaze is burning right near exit 54, through Coomera.</p>
      <p>The spectacle is creating delays in both directions, with the southbound delays looking particularly bad.</p>
      <p>One crew is currently on scene.</p>
