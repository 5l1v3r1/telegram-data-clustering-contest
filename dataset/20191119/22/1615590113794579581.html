      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:09:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1808" target="_blank">Rebekah Valentine</a></address>
      <p>Ganymede Games has announced it has raised $550,000 in angel financing to help continue development on its first title.</p>
      <p>The funding came from the New Mexico Angels, Arrowhead Innovation Fund, Abenteuer Ventures, and other individuals in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where the studio is based.</p>
      <p>Ganymede is using the funding toward a playable gameplay demo and internal testing of its first, unannounced title. The studio has also raised a total of $350,000 in Local Economic Development Act funding from both the state and city of Las Cruces.</p>
      <p>The studio was founded <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-07-ex-wargaming-riot-employees-form-ganymede-games">earlier this year</a> by veterans of Wargaming and Riot Games, and is building a headquarters in Las Cruces as the first game development company to take advantage of a New Mexico state tax credit for film, TV, and gaming companies.</p>
