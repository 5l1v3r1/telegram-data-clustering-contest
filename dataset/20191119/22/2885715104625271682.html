      <p>Two Warkaris were killed and at least 15 more were injured after an earthmover ran into a Dindi procession in Dive Ghat area near Pune on Tuesday morning. One of the deceased was a descendant of 14th century saint-poet Sant Namdeo.</p>
      <p>The accident took place in Dive Ghat area, 20 kilometres from Pune city, around 9.30 am when the Dindi procession of Warkaris was on its way to Alandi in Pune district from Pandharpur in Solapur district as part of the centuries-old tradition. The Warkaris — who perform yearly pilgrimages as a tradition of their sect — were on their way to attend a ceremony. Around 600 Warkaris were part of the procession.</p>
      <p>The deceased were identified as Sopan Maharaj Namdas (36) and Atul Mahadev Alshi (24).</p>
