      <h1>John McGinn double gives Scotland comfortable victory over Kazakhstan</h1>

      <p>Scotland fulfilled their original seeding by finishing third in Euro 2020 qualifying Group I with a win over Kazakhstan with a double from John McGinn – who has netted six in three games – and a goal from Steven Naismith. An element of needless embarrassment was injected into the otherwise inconsequential fixture by ragged Scottish defending which permitted the Kazakhs to take a first-half lead.</p>
      <p>The real significance of the evening occurred in Cardiff, where Wales’ victory over Hungary put the Hungarians into the frame – along with Israel and Bulgaria – to meet Scotland in Glasgow in a Nations League playoff semi-final in March. McGinn’s late strike from a Taylor cutback at least sent the fans home nursing ambition that looked improbable an hour earlier.</p>
      <p>The first premature Christmas decorations had been sighted en route to the game but we usually have to wait until well into the festive season for Silent Night. Hampden bucked the trend, however, as these teams played out the first half of an occasion that, on one of the coldest nights of the year, was never going to be billed as alluring.</p>
      <p>With their 3-0 win in Astana when the countries met for the first time ever in the Group I opening qualifier, the Kazakhs had engraved their names in Scotland’s chronicles of ignominy. That result put an end to Alex McLeish’s second tenure as the Scots’ manager and paved the way for Steve Clarke to take over, wearing the mantle of people’s favourite for the extraordinary improvement he wrought in Kilmarnock’s fortunes.</p>
      <p>The presence of Belgium and Russia in the group always looked close to insuperable, even before the humiliation in Astaba and so it proved, but a 6-0 drubbing of San Marino and the weekend’s 2-1 win against Cyprus in Nicosia offered Clarke the evidence to declare that he had detected improvement in the squad’s performance.</p>
      <p>That looked a hollow claim by half time as the Scots trudged from the field to a chorus of jeers from the sparse ranks of the chilled Tartan Army. Such nourishment as they had been served by their heroes consisted largely of James Forrest’s efforts. The Celtic winger had been the sole figure in Scotland’s new all-blue kit who looked up for the occasion.</p>
      <p>His speed and control on the left flank first released his clubmate Greg Taylor to thread a pass ahead of McGinn inside the box but, although he got across his marker, the Aston Villa man allowed the ball to skip off his boot and behind. Forrest’s next contributions were a cutback which Callum McGregor lofted over the cutback and then another prompt to McGinn for an effort that was pushed across goal and wide of the far post.</p>
      <p>Perhaps frustrated by this profligacy, Forrest cut into the box for a drive which forced Dmytro Nepogodov into his first save of the night, an example which attracted a like attempt from Ryan Christie. These brief encouragements were soon eclipsed by the consequence of carelessness by Liam Palmer who gave possession away to open a gap for Baktiyor Zainutdinov to bear down on the Scottish penalty area.</p>
      <p>Scott McKenna looked caught in two minds and could not block the striker’s right-footed curling shot which skimmed the post on its way past David Marshall. Scotland looked stunned and Forrest was literally so when cut down by Aibol Abiken just before the interval.</p>
      <p>Hard words were presumably uttered in the Scots’ dressing room because they began the second half with a purpose that had been absent previously and when Forrest was double tackled illegally on the edge of the box, McGinn found the net with a free kick which was helped by a big deflection.</p>
      <p>A procession of Scottish chances now followed and were rewarded with a second goal when Naismith got his head to a deflected cross from Palmer to nudge the ball home from a yard out.</p>
