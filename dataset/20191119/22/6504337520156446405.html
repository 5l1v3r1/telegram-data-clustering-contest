      <p>BART police confirmed a rider was stabbed and killed by another patron aboard one of its trains, forcing a temporary shutdown of the South Hayward Station.</p>
      <p>The suspect was later arrested a block from the station, according to BART police.</p>
      <p>The incident was first reported as a fight between two men in their 40s on a train, between the Bay Fair and Warm Springs stations just before 1 p.m., said BART Interim Police Chief Ed Alvarez. The fight reportedly started when the suspect attempted to steal a pair of shoes and was confronted, The Chronicle <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Person-dies-aboard-BART-train-in-Hayward-station-14847514.php">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>As the train approached the South Hayward Station, police were on the platform and the victim was found to be fatally stabbed.</p>
      <p>A man matching the suspect's description was found on Tennyson Road and was "involved in an issue at a local dealership," but Alvarez didn't elaborate further. The suspect was then arrested.</p>
      <p>Alvarez said the incident was not a random attack, stating that riders have a safe system and the stabbing is a "rare occurrence" on BART. He said that video aboard the train and at the station will be reviewed as part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>"Our thoughts are with the deceased and his loved ones," BART <a href="https://twitter.com/SFBART/status/1196924582239854592">said in a tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>BART General Manager Robert Powers promised to increase BART police presence at its stations in the aftermath of the stabbing, saying in a statement that police officers, non-sworn community service officers and fare inspectors will be "in the system, on station platforms, and riding the trains."</p>
      <p>“We are heartbroken that a person has lost his life due to violence on one of our trains this afternoon. We extend our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of the victim," Powers said.</p>
      <p>"BART is taking immediate steps to address concerns many of our riders may have as a result of the tragic death. ... The safety of our customers and employees is, and always will be, our top priority."</p>
      <p>The South Hayward Station was closed at 1 p.m. as BART police and the Hayward Police Department investigated the fatal incident, said BART spokesman Jim Allison. Trains did not stop at the station and were forced to single track-through South Hayward during the shutdown.</p>
      <p>The station was re-opened at about 5:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>Riders can continue to expect a residual 20-minute delay on the Warm Springs line, in the Warm Springs, Richmond and Daly City directions.</p>
