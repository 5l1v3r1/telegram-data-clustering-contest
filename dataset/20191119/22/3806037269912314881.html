      <h2>The Spotify-esque feature may debut “as soon as next month.”</h2>

      <p>The company behind <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/tiktok">TikTok</a> may be releasing its own music streaming service “as soon as next month,” according to reports. Parent company <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/bytedance">ByteDance</a> is rumored to be in talks with several big record companies to launch a platform to compete with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/spotify">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple-music">Apple Music</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the <i><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ffaed23a-07dd-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">Financial Times</a></i>, the streaming service will first arrive in opening markets such as India before making its introduction in the United States. It went on to report music executives are “keen to make money” from the free-to-use app TikTok, whose users utilize lip-syncing, dancing, and music in their videos.</p>
      <p>TikTok recently revealed it has amassed over one billion monthly active users and that its app has been <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/tiktok-downloaded-1-5-billion-times-instagram">downloaded 1.5 billion times</a>.</p>
      <p>Comparatively, Spotify shares declined by 3% following the news, while also declining 5% after Amazon made the announcement that its <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/amazon-music-free-music-streaming-service">music streaming service would now be available for free</a>.</p>
