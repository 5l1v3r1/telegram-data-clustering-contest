      <p>Twenty-five migrants have been found in a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for the UK from the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>It comes just weeks after 39 bodies, all believed to be Vietnamese migrants, were found in a lorry in Essex on 23 October, after arriving on a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
      <p>In the latest incident, the Britannia Seaways ship returned to the port of Vlaardingen, near Rotterdam, after the stowaways were discovered.</p>
      <p>Two of the stowaways were taken to hospital for treatment and the remaining 23 were taken away by police.</p>
      <p>Gert Jakobsen, vice president of communications with the ship’s operator DFDS, said the migrants were found after they made a hole in the trailer.</p>
      <p>The roll on, roll off ferry was not far off the Dutch coast en route to Felixtowe, Suffolk, when the discovery was made at around 5pm on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘We don’t know about the checks. Of course, they were not in a very good condition.</p>
      <p>‘Unfortunately this is not the first time we have had such a situation. Of course, it’s rare they hide in a refrigerated trailer.</p>
      <p>‘But we do find migrants even though we try to prevent it.’</p>
      <p>The ages, sex or where the migrants are from is as of yet unknown.</p>
