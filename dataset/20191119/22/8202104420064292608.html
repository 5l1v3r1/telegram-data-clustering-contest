      <p>The fine for a second offence within one year of being convicted of the first will increase to $1,400, as well as an additional four demerits plus an immediate seven-day vehicle seizure. A third offence within one year of the first conviction will result in a $2,100 ticket, four more demerits and another seven-day vehicle seizure.</p>
      <p>“Enough is enough,” Minister Responsible for SGI Joe Hargrave said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Despite increased enforcement by police and significant awareness efforts by SGI, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/you-dont-get-to-do-things-over-mom-who-lost-teen-daughter-in-suspected-distracted-driving-crash-calls-on-others-to-pay-attention-to-road">22 people lost their lives on Saskatchewan roads in 2018</a> due to distracted driving or inattention. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/sgi-reports-jump-in-road-fatalities-in-2018-distracted-driving-continues-to-be-a-problem/wcm/968df5a1-a11b-42d0-8cef-59a0f8c4bedc">That is 22 deaths too many</a>.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, distraction or inattention were factors in more than 6,000 collisions and 774 injuries, according to SGI. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/more-than-3000-charges-laid-during-road-safety-week">Between May and July this year</a>, more than 1,000 distracted driving tickets were issued across the province.</p>
      <p>Under The Traffic Safety Act, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/1400-school-zone-speeding-tickets-nearly-800-distracted-driving-tickets-issued-in-sask-last-month-sgi">distracted driving tickets are issued to drivers convicted</a> of holding, viewing, using or manipulating a cell phone while driving a motor vehicle on a highway, or while driving a vehicle on a highway without due care and attention.</p>
      <p>“Distracted driving kills and injures people; it is a serious safety concern, and our government is sending a direct message to drivers,” Hargrave said.</p>
      <p>“Yes, the tickets are costly. Don’t want to get one? It’s easy. Put the phone down, keep your head up, and focus on the road.”</p>
