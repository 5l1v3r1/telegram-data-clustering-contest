      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:41:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Prince Andrew’s</a> reputation is in tatters as big sponsors and charities line up to dump him over his relationship with paedo pal Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Five organisations rushed to sever ties with the Duke of York as Buckingham Palace was feverishly attempting to carry out a “damage-limitation” exercise after his car-crash interview with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC.</a></p>
      <p>Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith also accused Andrew of making “racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable” to a group of British politicians.</p>
      <p>It came less than 24 hours after palace aides tried to rubbish claims by a former No10 adviser who said Andrew used a racial slur in front of him.</p>
      <p>Palace aides have removed the “Supporters” page from the website of Andrew’s Pitch@Palace mentoring charity. The page had listed the charity’s 35 key backers.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered, the main sponsors of Liverpool FC, joined accountancy firm KPMG – which took away its £100,000-a-year sponsorship – as the latest big business to pull the plug.</p>
      <p>The firm said it would not renew its deal with Pitch@Palace, which expires next month, for “commercial reasons”.</p>
      <p>But insiders at the firm told how months of lurid headlines surrounding the Duke’s associations with disgraced US financier Epstein were to blame.</p>

      <p>AdWeek Europe also pulled its backing. It is refusing to invite the Duke of York or his team to its four-day summit in London next March, which is one of the largest annual global gatherings of advertising executives and experts.</p>
      <p>A string of other major firms are reconsidering their links after Andrew admitted he stayed with convicted paedo Epstein at his mansion in New York for four days in 2010 because it was “convenient”.</p>
      <p>Convicted sex offender Epstein killed himself aged 66 in August while awaiting trial on under-age sex trafficking charges in New York.</p>
      <p>Epstein’s “sex slave” Virginia Roberts, now called Guiffre, claims that Andrew slept with her three times, which the Duke strongly denies.</p>
      <p>Insurance giant Aon has also asked for its name to be removed from Pitch@Palace’s website.</p>

      <p>Medical firm AstraZeneca’s three-year partnership with the charity, due to expire at the end of 2019, is being reviewed.</p>
      <p>And the Outward Bound Trust, which Andrew is patron of and which is said to be one of the royal family’s most-loved organisations, is to hold an emergency board meeting in the next few days to discuss the crisis.</p>
      <p>Andrew’s oldest daughter Princess Beatrice, who is a trustee, will not be involved in the meeting, sources said.</p>
      <p>London Metropolitan University said it will review the Duke’s role as its patron at its board of governors meeting next week. It said it “opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse and human trafficking”.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield University Student Union voted for Andrew to step down from his role as ceremonial head of the university. The motion said: “We should not be represented by a man with ties to organised child sexual exploitation and assault.”</p>
      <p>Murdoch University in Western Australia was also reviewing links with the royal.</p>
      <p>Doubts now exist over Andrew’s links to 189 charities worldwide, with several refusing to say if he has their support.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace refused to comment on allegations by former Home Secretary Ms Smith. She said, about meeting Andrew at a banquet: “It was a state dinner for the Saudi royal family and he made racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable.”</p>

      <p>Mrs Smith did not reveal when incident took place, but the only state visit by the Saudi royal family during her time as Home Secretary was in 2007.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: “HRH has undertaken a considerable amount of work in the Middle East over a period of years and has many friends from the region. He does not tolerate racism in any form.”</p>
      <p>It comes after Evening Standard columnist Rohan Silva claimed on Monday that he heard Andrew use the expression “n***** in the woodpile”. The palace has categorically denied he used the word.</p>
      <p>In his BBC interview on Saturday, the Duke twice said his relationship with Epstein had some “seriously beneficial outcomes”, allowing him to meet people and prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>Andrew again denied sleeping with Epstein’s US victim Ms Giuffre, 35.</p>
      <p>He said an alleged encounter with her in 2001 – allegedly orchestrated by Epstein’s “fixer” Ghislaine Maxwell – did not happen. Andrew said he had no recollection of meeting Virginia.</p>
      <p>The palace is bracing itself for more revelations after the Mirror revealed that Virginia recorded an interview with BBC Panorama three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Dickie Arbiter, former communications secretary to the Queen, called for Andrew to “step away” immediately.</p>
      <p>He said: “The damage being done is enormous and could end up being catastrophic, not only for the Royal Family but for the many charities he is involved with. The best thing for him to do is take an immediate sabbatical.”</p>
