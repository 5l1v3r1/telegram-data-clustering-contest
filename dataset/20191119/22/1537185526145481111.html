      <p>CLOVIS, N.M. (KFDA) - A man accused of a murder that happened earlier this month will be held without bond.</p>
      <p>A Curry County judge granted the stateâ€™s motion to hold Johnny Rae Vigil without bond.</p>
      <p>Vigil was indicted by a grand jury for the <a href="https://www.newschannel10.com/2019/11/08/person-interest-wanted-clovis-homicide-case/?fbclid=IwAR3v1sm3QuBIYhDq2pbS6RP1a26W9PwvHuJiF8S_5b9WhgijotGfYbpOBnw">shooting death of Jahmall Burge that happened on November 7.</a></p>
      <p>Judge Tatum stated Vigil is a danger to the community, and no release conditions would protect the community.</p>
      <p>The judge also stated that Vigil had been released from jail 36 hours before the murder.</p>
      <p>Vigil has violated his probation in the past, and he has difficulty following conditions of release, according to the judge.</p>
