      <p>The Canadian artist got his first record deal in 1988 and since then has released 19 albums and been nominated and won dozens of music awards, including being nominated for 17 Juno Awards - winning six of them.</p>
      <p>Over the course of his career, James has performed alongside Stevie Ray Vaughn, Carlos Santana, Lenny Kravitz as well as countless others and has had a string of commercial hits.
