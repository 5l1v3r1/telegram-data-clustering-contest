      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has been voted as the winner of tonight’s ITV election debate in a snap poll – but only by a small majority.</p>
      <p>Much like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>, the public was split on who performed better in the first leadership showdown ahead of the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>A YouGov / Sky News poll found 51% of Brits believe the PM performed better than his rival Jeremy Corbyn, who won 49% of people’s favour.</p>
      <p>However, many have been quick to point out that given how ahead the Tories were in the polls before tonight, the result is no real victory for Johnson.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The survey of 1,646 viewers was conducted immediately after the leaders’ debate.</p>
      <p>When asked who performed well, more voted for Jeremy Corbyn than Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The YouGov analysis found almost half of 2017 Tory voters (48%) think the Labour leader did well, and one third (33%) of those who opted for Corbyn’s party at the last election think the Prime Minister made a decent show of it.</p>

      <p>A preliminary survey published this morning showed that the public expected Boris Johnson to perform better by 37% to Jeremy Corbyn’s 23%.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the debate, Tories surged ahead of the polls with an 11 point lead.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the results, BBC presenter Andrew Neil said: ‘YouGov poll puts Johnson v marginally ahead of Corbyn in tonight’s debate. But given Tories way ahead of Labour in polls not a great result for Johnson. But not a game changer.’</p>
      <p>Sky News reporter Lewis Goodall tweeted: ‘On balance, those numbers are probably better for Corbyn. Being SO far behind on personal ratings, if you’ve won over half the audience, that has to be a win, you must have surprised some people.’</p>

      <p>A break down of the poll showed that while people believe Boris Johnson to be more ‘prime ministerial’, Jeremy Corbyn won viewers over for being more trust worthy and more in touch with ordinary people.</p>

      <p>While people though Boris performed better on Brexit, they preferred Corbyn’s answers on the NHS.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s debate saw the Prime Minister and Labour leader clash on the NHS, Brexit and what Christmas presents they would give each other, in the first of a series of political debates ahead of the December 12 vote.</p>
      <p>A studio audience laughed and groaned at points during the hour-long debate.</p>
      <p>The two men most likely to be leading the country in less than three weeks also answered questions on the royal family, the climate crisis and the union – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/boris-johnson-corbyn-share-awkward-handshake-live-tv-clash-11184508/">even shook hands at one stage</a>, when host Julie Etchingham pushed the pair into a pledge to make political debate more polite.</p>

      <p>She asked if the Prime Minister had ‘dug himself a new ditch’ over Brexit, in reference to previous pledges to leave the EU, noted the issue of anti-Semitism in the Labour party and asked both about a ‘magic money tree’ on spending.</p>
      <p>And both leaders were laughed at by a studio audience of around 200 people, who took issue with Mr Johnson on the issue of trust and Mr Corbyn’s backing for a four-day working week.</p>

      <p>Many viewers were left underwhelmed by the debate.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Sky News correspondent Lewis Goodall said both leaders seemed ‘disliked in equal measure’ by the audience, which he said ‘more or less tallies with my travels on the road.’</p>
      <p>Journalist Paul Mason said the debate was ‘stiled’ and that  neither leader got into full flow.</p>
      <p>Sebastian Payne from the Financial Times said it was ‘a zero sum game.’</p>
      <p>He tweeted: ‘Nobody learned or gained anything. Both candidates resorted to soundbites and simplistic arguments. No real debate on policy.’</p>
      <p>ITV’s Robert Peston said the YouGov survey ‘felt right’ given ‘neither leader landed a killer blow and neither made a catastrophic booboo.’ </p>
      <p>The YouGov survey showed 58% of viewers came away from the debate feeling frustrated, compared to 45% finding it interesting and 35% finding it engaging.</p>
