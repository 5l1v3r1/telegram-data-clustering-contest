      <p>Calling Mahatma Gandhi as "Ajatshatru" (a person who has no enemies), Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday in his speech claimed that "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, through his hard work and deed, is trying to make his personality as Ajatashatru". </p>
      <p>Tomar was speaking at Gandhi-founded Sabarmati Ashram here on occasion of the conclusion of state BJP's three-day "Gandhi Sankalp Yatra".</p>
      <p>The Ashram, known for its simplicity and tranquillity, was all decked up in an unusual way with a stage erected right near the Hriday Kunj, the historic house where Gandhi lived soon after returning from South Africa.</p>
      <p>Posters of Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, chief minister Vijay Rupani among others were hung all around the Ashram. This is the same Ashram that Prime Minister Modi wants to turn into a "world-class memorial."</p>
      <p>Tomar said that "By his deeds, behaviour and personality Gandhiji made himself ajatashatru who had no opponents. That's why even today, the whole world bows down to show respect." He said that Gandhi was educated and a barrister who could have lived a happy life but he chose to get India free from slavery. </p>
      <p>Giving the example of Gandhi's thoughts for self-reliance, the agriculture minister said that "There are big factories in the country but those are not able to resolve unemployment. But, today our prime minister, through skill development and by encouraging small scale industries, is giving jobs to crores of youngsters." </p>
      <p>"There was a time when the whole country used to side with Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Many prime ministers came after him but it is Modiji who has that kind of mass appeal," he said.</p>
      <p>Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani told the gathering how Modi built Mahatma Mandir, Dandi Memorial, Statue of Unity in memories of Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.</p>
