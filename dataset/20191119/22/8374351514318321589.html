      <p>The Filipina Women’s Network (FWN) has named MFT Group of Companies Chief Executive Mica F. Tan as among the Most Influential Filipina Women in the World.</p>
      <p>She joins a roster of women leaders who will receive their award during the organization’s #FWNSummit2019 to be held from October 28 to November 2 in Paris, France.</p>
      <p>Tan was recognized by FWN as an emerging leader of her generation. Inspired by her family’s entrepreneurial mindset, she is one of the youngest Filipina who is making a mark by leading MFT Group of Companies, a private equity group that restructures the corporate blueprints of family legacy businesses.</p>
      <p>“It has always been my dream to lead a new breed of enterprising individuals; those who are able to see smart investment opportunities that may bring brands to the global platform. And I feel honored to have been recognized by FWN as an emerging leader in this field,” said Tan.</p>
      <p>She added that, “this award pushes me further to increase our company’s business footprint by becoming the most recognized strategic business partner of local and global businesses.”</p>
      <p>Since its establishment, MFT Group has significantly grown and expanded its investment and operational teams to over 9 countries and 18 cities worldwide.</p>
      <p>The Filipina Women’s Network recognizes women of Philippine ancestry who are changing the face of leadership in the global workplace, having reached status for outstanding work in their respective fields and are recognized for their contributions to society, female mentorship, and legacy.</p>
      <p>Tan was selected from an outstanding field of nominees from around the world. For this award, Tan was nominated by the Global FWN President Georgitta Pimentel Puyat, who is the chairman of Philippine Orchard Corporation. Puyat was also a 2017 Global FWN100™ Awardee.</p>
      <p>“I recognized Mica as a young visionary, an astute innovator, and a next generation philanthropist; an unstoppable force with her sights set beyond the future of her current endeavors,” said Puyat.</p>
      <p>She added that, “I saw this even back then when I first met her at age 10. She is nominated not only because of her exceptional business acumen and her personal advocacies to promote education, health, and entrepreneurship, but her stature as an influential, magnificent role model to Filipina Women everywhere.”</p>
      <p>The FWN100™ Award was launched in the United States in 2006 and expanded its search globally in 2013.<br/>Many of the awardees have reached the pinnacle of their careers breaking the “glass ceiling” at the C-Suite level and in politics – California Chief Justice Tani Gorre Cantil-Sakauye, Health Net CEO and now Sterling CEO Cora Manase Tellez, Charles Schwab Investments CEO and now Commonwealth Club Board Chair Evelyn Dilsaver,</p>
      <p>Philippines Vice President Leni Robredo, first Filipina deputy mayor of Hertsmere, UK Cynthia Barker, entrepreneur and Richprime Global President and CEO Myrna Yao, Cebu Governor and former Philippines House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Gwen Garcia, Utah Valley University President Astrid S. Tuminez.</p>
      <p>Legato Health Technologies Philippines Inc., An Anthem Company, CountryHead and former Undersecretary of Philippines Department of Trade and Industry Nora Terrado, four Rear Admirals in the U. S. Navy: Connie Mariano, Raquel Cruz Bono, Eleanor Valentin, and Babette Bolivar.</p>
      <p>But not all awardees are in the C-Suite level. There were also influential emerging leaders and community advocates who have been recognized for their accomplishments.</p>
      <p>“The Global FWN100™awardees are innovators and thought leaders, dynamic entrepreneurs, rising stars under age 35, practitioners, behind-the-scenes leaders, and public service advocates, who have moved through the ranks in the public and private sectors. They are magnificent women doing extraordinary work motivating next generation leaders,” said Marily Mondejar, CEO of the Filipina Women’s Network.</p>
