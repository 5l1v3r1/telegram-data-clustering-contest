      <p>The reality star, who was joined at the party by her famous pal and former co-star Ferne McCann, posed up with a giant pink balloon with the words "it's a girl" printed on the front.</p>
      <p>Danielle announced earlier this month that she's expecting her first baby.</p>
      <p>She shared the news on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> by sharing a series of loved-up pictures of her and her beau together, including one of her holding up an ultrasound scan.</p>
