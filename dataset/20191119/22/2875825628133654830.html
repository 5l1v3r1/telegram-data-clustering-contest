      <h1>Ireland U21's 4 Sweden U21's 1: Emphatic second-half sees Kenny's Kids overcome Swedes</h1>
      <h2>Trailing to Sweden at the break, second-half goals from Lee O’Connor, Adam Idah, Troy Parrott and Zack Elbouzedi wrapped up their fifth win in seven qualifiers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:51:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/john-fallon/" target="_blank">John Fallon</a></address>
      <p>A stirring second-half comeback earned Ireland U-21s victory to keep them three points clear at the top of their European Championship qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Trailing to Sweden at the break, second-half goals from Lee O’Connor, Adam Idah, Troy Parrott and Zack Elbouzedi wrapped up their fifth win in seven qualifiers.</p>
      <p>A slow start by Ireland galvanised the visitors, who hit the front in devastating style on 18 minutes.</p>
      <p>Viktor Gyokres chased a pass down the left channel, slipped inside Nathan Collins and found the far corner with a thunderbolt.</p>
      <p>It meant little as straight from the kick-off, Elbouzedi was released down the right channel, only to angle his drive wide of the nearpost.</p>
      <p>O’Connor notched his first goal at this level on 49 minutes by feeding Elbouzedi on the right before arriving into the box to guide his low cross into the top corner.</p>
      <p>Back in the game and back on top, Stephen Kenny’s cubs were relentless in their pressing.</p>

      <p>On 64 minutes the comeback was completed as Idah again managed to peel of his marker to connect with Elbouzedi’s pinpoint cross to steer his first-time shot home.</p>
      <p>Rudderless and ragged, the Swedes were there for the taking and unlike the seniors last night, no mercy was shown to these scandinavians.</p>
      <p>With 17 minutes left, Parrott made the most of space and time to stroke a shot across goal into the net.</p>
      <p>Idah and Ronan both went close to adding a fourth but that honour fell to Elbouzedi.</p>
      <p>Having just been denied by the feet of Pontus Dahlberg, the unattached winger gave the Watford goalkeeper no chance three minutes from time by tapping home Ronan’s cross. </p>
