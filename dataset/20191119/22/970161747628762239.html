      <p>I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here is throwing soap favourites Andrew Whyment and Cliff Parisi into the jungle to mix things up.</p>
      <p>Cliff Parisi is best known for playing Minty Peterson on EastEnders from 2002-2010. He has also made appearances on Hollyoaks and Casualty over the years.</p>
      <p>However, since 2012 the actor has starred as Fred Buckle, a handyman, in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/call-the-midwife/">Call the Midwife</a> where he’s worked alongside stars such as Miranda Hart, Helen George and Miriam Margolyes.</p>
      <p>Coronation Street fans will recognise Andy for playing the hapless factory worker Kirk Sutherland.</p>
      <p>The actors are set to join the other celebs this week now that Snake Rock has merged with the main camp.</p>
      <p>Ahead of their jungle debut, Andy, 38 and 59-year-old Cliff posed with some Australian wildlife to get them in the mood for camp.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Cliff, wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, gets to have cuddles with a koala.</p>
      <p>Cliff admitted that after turning down a spot on the show earlier this year, he decided to go for it because of ‘the taxman’.</p>
      <p>The actor told The Sun: ‘Yeah, I have got a bill I need to pay. Like everyone at this time of year you go, “Oh no! Again. I thought I paid that”.</p>
      <p>‘I had a meeting about this earlier on in the year and I thought about it long and hard and said no and then as it crept along to September and I got an estimate for my tax I phoned them up and said “is it too late to say yes?” So here I am.</p>
      <p>‘I give myself a bit of a talking to, and then I spoke to the accountant and he made my mind up.’</p>

      <p>Fans were confused when the line-up for this year was first announced and Andrew, who had been rumoured to appear, wasn’t on the list.</p>

      <p>And Cliff’s addition to the jungle was only revealed on Monday night.</p>
      <p>‘With Cliff and Andy we have got two big soap names joining the jungle and they’ll be a lot of fun,’ an ITV source told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-secret-12th-im-celebrity-20902767">The Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Cliff is the final piece in the puzzle and comes from two massive BBC shows. It will be interesting to see if he sees the funny side of things when he has been in there a while and the hunger and tiredness kicks in.’</p>
      <p>They join current campers Caitlyn Jenner, Kate Garraway, Adele Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Jacqueline Jossa, Roman Kemp, Ian Wright, James Haskall, Myles Stephenson and Andrew Maxwell.</p>
