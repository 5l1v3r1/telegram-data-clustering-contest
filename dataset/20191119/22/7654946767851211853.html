      <h1>Disgraced pol Hiram Monserrate plots latest comeback with Assembly bid</h1>

      <p>Disgraced former state Sen. Hiram Monserrate is making yet another bid for elective office.</p>
      <p>The felon, who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/14/new-york-democrats-pick-some-scandalous-candidates/">elected a Democratic district leader</a> in Queens last year, has filed paperwork to run for Assembly in a primary challenge against incumbent Jeffry Aubry, one of the most senior and highly regarded black lawmakers in the legislature.</p>
      <p>One Monserrate pal said the former lawmaker is feeling more confident about winning elective office again after his strong showing in the district leader’s race last year.</p>
      <p>“Hiram ran for district leader in that Assembly district and won,” said the source, noting that a whole slate of candidates allied with Monserrate also were elected.</p>
      <p>Monserrate lost three previous comeback races for the Senate, Assembly and City Council.</p>
      <p>The 35th Assembly District takes in East Elmhurst and North Corona, an area that was once predominately African American but now has a large and growing Latino population.</p>
      <p>Aubry, first elected in a special election in 1992, serves as chairman of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus.</p>
      <p>The Queens Democratic Party establishment won’t take kindly to Monserrate challenging Aubry.</p>
      <p>“This is the type of hubris that landed Monserrate in prison,” one prominent Queens Democratic Party official, who requested anonymity, told The Post.</p>

      <p>“Assemblyman Aubry is one of the most respected and senior members of the Assembly. It’s crazy,” said a Queens Democratic party official, who added: that Monserrate has a “low regard for the acumen of voters in the district.”</p>
      <p>“This is a race for elective office, not a party position,” the party insider said.</p>
      <p>Monserrate was kicked out of the state Senate in 2010 after being convicted of misdemeanor assault for a brutal 2008 attack on his girlfriend, Karla Giraldo.</p>
      <p>The disgraced pol <a href="https://nypost.com/2009/09/23/hiram-the-draggin-lady/">was caught on tape</a> dragging a battered and bleeding Giraldo through the lobby of his apartment building as she desperately tried to seek help from a neighbor.</p>
      <p>He was acquitted of charges that he first flew into a rage and slashed her face with a broken glass after discovering a police officer’s union card in her wallet.</p>
      <p>Monserrate’s lawyers claimed the cut came from a “freak accident” when he tripped while giving Giraldo a glass of water.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors later <a href="https://nypost.com/2012/05/04/ex-state-sen-hiram-monserrate-pleads-guilty-in-slush-fund-case/">nailed him in 2012 for misusing</a> $100,000 in public funds as a city Councilman and he was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
      <p>Years later, Giraldo was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/26/karla-barba-gets-3-years-in-prison-for-samurai-sword-attack-on-fiance/">sentenced to three years</a> behind bars for attacking her new fiancé with a samurai sword.</p>
