      <h1>Patriots’ Offense Receives Huge Boost Ahead Of Cowboys Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:03:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Even though the New England Patriots own a 9-1 record,  the offense has really struggled over the past few weeks. Fortunately for the defending champions, help is on the way.</p>
      <p>One of the main concerns for the Patriots is their offensive line, which hasn’t been very effective through the first two months of the season.</p>
      <p>Injuries have played a major factor in why New England is having issues in the trenches. However, the offensive line will receive a much-needed boost this weekend against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN insider Field Yates, the Patriots have officially activated Isaiah Wynn to the 53-man roster.</p>
      <p>Wynn is set to play this Sunday against Dallas. He missed the past eight games due to a foot injury.</p>
      <p>The Patriots believe Wynn’s return will help protect Tom Brady’s blindside.</p>

      <p>New England selected Wynn in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft. This is the second-straight season that Wynn missed time because of injuries – he missed all of his rookie campaign due to a torn Achilles.</p>
      <p>Marshall Newhouse has served as the starting left tackle for the Patriots in Wynn’s absence. He’ll most likely be the backup offensive tackle this Sunday.</p>
