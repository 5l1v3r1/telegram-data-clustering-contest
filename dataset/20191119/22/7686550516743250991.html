      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-qualify-for-euro-2020-17276617">Wales have qualified for Euro 2020</a> and the scenes in Cardiff were incredible.</p>
      <p>A brace from Juventus star Aaron Ramsey secured a place for Ryan Giggs' side at the tournament next summer, sparking jubilant celebrations at the Cardiff City Stadium and across the country.</p>
      <p>A dominant home performance saw former Arsenal man Ramsey strike in both halves, linking with Gareth Bale for his brilliant header before half-time.</p>
      <p>It was a great night for the midfielder, who missed the majority of the campaign due to injury.</p>

      <p>Keeping emotions in check is difficult on occasions like these, and Bale, it seems, is no different.</p>
      <p>The pair were interviewed in the immediate aftermath of the game by Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>Ramsey said: "We had the best time of our lives in France so we wanted to really make sure we got it this time, and we missed out on the World Cup so it was a big effort. I've missed a lot of this campaign, but it's all worthwhile. Chipping in with a couple of goals tonight is amazing."</p>
      <p>The pitchside interviewer then asked Bale: "Gareth, what was it like to have him back in the side, he didn't half contribute tonight?"</p>
      <p>"It's about time he contributed, isn't it? F***ing..." before he gave off a sheepish grin, much to the delight of team-mate Ramsey whom he hugged closely.</p>
      <p>Bale, composure then regained, added: "No, obviously, he is a world-class player and it was great to have him back, and he showed again tonight what a great player he is, and two more goals that helped us through."</p>
      <p>The interviewer apologised to viewers for Bale's language, but not many in these parts will care too much about it.</p>
