      <h1>Ballarat fire danger period announced</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:45:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Hopkins</a></address>
      <p>With the mercury set to rise well past 30 degrees and a total fire ban in place for Friday, the official fire danger period is set to be announced for Ballarat and its surrounding regions.</p>
      <p>An official request has been submitted by District 15 for Ballarat, Hepburn, Golden Plains and Moorabool to have their fire danger periods commence from 1am on December 9.</p>
      <p>The request is yet to be confirmed, but is unlikely to be overturned.</p>
      <p>The core restriction during the fire danger period means people cannot light a fire in the open air without a permit or complying with certain requirements.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Other restrictions apply for specific regions, however they are yet to be released for the regions named above.</p>
      <p>This comes off the back of the announcement police are preparing to activate Operation Safeguard, aiming to reduce the occurrence and impact of intentional and reckless fires.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>The Courier, </i>Ballarat Inspector Trevor Cornwill said police will be relentless in investigating anyone reported doing the wrong thing as part of the operation.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"We'll be absolutely relentless in investigating any fire that is deemed suspicious and we will charge people who are lighting fires on days when they're not meant to be," he said.</p>
      <p>"Anyone found guilty of recklessly or intentionally starting a bushfire can be found guilty of up to 15 years imprisonment.</p>

      <p>"They're quite severe penalties and rightly so... we can see the impact fires have had on New South Wales and Queensland in recent times and here in Victoria in the past."</p>
      <p>With the region having dealt with a large number of car fires the inspector said Ballarat police will be keeping a close eye on potential recidivist arsonists who are known to police.</p>
      <p>"Certainly our recidivist offenders that are known to us for stealing cars and lighting them up we'll be closely monitored and we'll be looking to cut them off at the early stages.</p>
      <p>"There will be an increased police presence to remind them that we are there and we are watching them."</p>
