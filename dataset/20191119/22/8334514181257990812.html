      <p>The felony charges filed Tuesday in Westmoreland County include 10 counts of child pornography, 10 counts of unlawful contact with a minor and one count of corruption of a minor.</p>
      <p>Vazquez, 28, was already facing multiple felony charges in both Pennsylvania and Florida alleging sexual contact with a 13-year-old girl. He was originally arrested in September by Pennsylvania State Police on a warrant issued by authorities in Florida.</p>
      <p>According to court documents, a search of his iPhone XS and Apple MacBook Pro led to Tuesday’s additional charges. Police found seven photographs and three videos of a girl “in various stages of nudity,” wrote Trooper Michael Thompson in the criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>Vazquez is also facing multiple charges in Lee County, Fla., involving the same accuser.</p>
      <p>The judge on Tuesday denied Florida’s request for extradition.</p>
      <p>“He will stay until the charges are disposed of in this county,” Westmoreland County Common Pleas Court Judge Rita Hathway said, per The Tribune-Review.</p>
      <p>Vazquez is being held without bail in the Westmoreland County Prison.</p>
      <p>Major League Baseball placed Vazquez on administrative leave in September under its joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy.</p>
