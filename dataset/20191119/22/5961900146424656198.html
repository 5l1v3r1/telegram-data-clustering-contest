      </p>
      <p>Two federal prison guards tasked with overseeing <b>Jeffrey Epstein</b> the night he died have been arrested and charged, after allegedly falsifying records saying they checked on his cell multiple times throughout the evening.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/nyregion/epstein-prison-guards-arrested.html">The New York Times</a> reports a criminal indictment against guards <b>Tova Noel</b> and <b>Michael Thomas,</b> which was unsealed on Tuesday, accuses the pair of sleeping and online shopping in the hours before they found Epstein’s body on August 10.</p>
      <p>While the Metropolitan Correctional Centre guards were required to check Epstein’s cell every half-hour, the indictment states neither Noel or Thomas fulfilled that duty – despite signing timesheets claiming they had.</p>
      <p>Both guards “repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction,” said <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/jeffrey-epstein-s-jail-guards-charged-with-falsifying-records-20191120-p53c6b.html">US Attorney <b>Geoffrey Berman.</b></a></p>
      <p>The pair pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud the United States and faking official documents, the NYT states.</p>
      <p>Epstein, a billionaire financier who was convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution of a minor, was awaiting trial on new child sex abuse charges at the time of his death.</p>
      <p>The death of such a high-profile inmate, with known connections to many rich and powerful figures, sparked intense speculation about what exactly happened at the facility.</p>

      <p>While the New York City medical examiner concluded Epstein’s death was the result of suicide, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein’s estate and who was present for the autopsy said <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/jeffrey-epstein-pathologist-comment-hyoid-bone/">his injuries were suggestive of homicide. </a></p>
      <p>Those theories have been downplayed by authorities.</p>
      <p>It has since emerged that the prison was undergoing significant staff shortages at the time of Epstein’s death. The NYT reports Noel was on a 16-hour double shift at the time, while Thomas had already done considerable overtime in the days prior.</p>
