      <h1>Gillingham 1-0 Sunderland (AET) report: Black Cats crash out at the first hurdle of FA Cup</h1>
      <h2>Phil Parkinson's Sunderland exited the FA Cup at the first round stage as Brandon Hanlan's goal settled this replay at Priestfield Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:31:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland marked a new low as they crashed out of the FA Cup at the first round stage for the first time in almost a century.</p>
      <p>The Black Cats were beaten 1-0 by Gillingham in extra-time in a replay at the Priestfield Stadium, having drawn the initial match 1-1 on Wearside.</p>
      <p>The sides did not manage a single shot on target in 90 minutes of normal time in Kent, which meant an extra half-hour which neither team – nor the 3,500 fans who endured this dire contest – wanted.</p>
      <p>The Gills hit the woodwork through Max Ehmer in the added period and minutes later Brandon Hanlan scored the all-important goal, just before half-time in extra-time, with the only on-target shot that either side managed throughout the entire 120 minutes of action.</p>
      <p>This was the first time <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> have exited the FA Cup at the first round stage since 1924 - when all clubs still entered at that stage.</p>
      <p>It is only the third time since the competition took on its modern format they have started in the first round, and on the previous two occasions – last season and in 1987-88 – they were knocked out in the second round.</p>
      <p>It means Sunderland have now been knocked out of all three cup competitions – the FA Cup, Carabao Cup, and the EFL Trophy – in the space of three weeks.</p>
      <p>And they have now won just one of their last seven games in all competitions, and that was a narrow 1-0 victory over Southend United in the league at the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>Phil Parkinson made five changes to the side that started last week’s EFL Trophy defeat at Scunthorpe United – four of which were forced upon him by injuries.</p>

      <p>Brandon Taylor, Alim Ozturk, and Laurens De Bock came into the side as Parkinson switched to a three-man back line, with injured centre-backs Jordan Willis, Joel Lynch, and midfielder George Dobson missing out.</p>
      <p>Will Grigg returned after a sickness bug ruled him out at Scunthorpe and he took the place of Marc McNulty, who was absent due to injury.</p>
      <p>The only unforced change saw Chris Maguire replace Aiden McGeady.</p>
      <p>With Sunderland’s squad severely stretched due to injuries and international call-ups, Parkinson included five U23 players on the bench – Anthony Patterson, Bali Mumba, Lee Connelly, Jack Bainbridge, and Ruben Sammut.</p>
      <p>Gillingham boss Steve Evans made one change to the side that beat Lincoln City at the weekend, bringing in Alex Jakubiak in place of former Sunderland youngster Mikael Mandron, who missed out through illness.</p>
      <p>The first half was short on goalmouth action, with both sides struggling to carve out clear-cut chances.</p>
      <p>De Bock headed wide from a free-kick early on, and a miscued cross from Max Power forced Jack Bonham to claw the ball out from under the bar.</p>
      <p>On the half-hour Luke O’Nien played a one-two with Maguire and got to the byline on the right but his attempted cross was bundled behind by Bonham.</p>
      <p>At the other end, Hanlan caused problems and he headed wide from a good position, and later he got the better of De Bock on the right but his shot from inside the box clipped the heels of Ozturk which diverted the ball wide.</p>
      <p>The second half followed a similar pattern, with Grigg coming closest to breaking the deadlock when he was set up by substitute McGeady on the edge of the box, but his low shot went narrowly wide of the left-hand post.</p>
      <p>And with so little quality on show, it was no surprise that the game ended goalless after 90 minutes, sending the tie into extra-time.</p>
      <p>It was one-way traffic in the additional half-hour, and Ehmer crashed a shot against the crossbar with Lee Burge beaten.</p>

      <p>The breakthrough came seconds before half-time in extra-time.</p>
      <p>Olly Lee played the ball to the unmarked Hanlan in the right-hand channel, he got into the area before planting a low shot beyond Burge into the bottom left-hand corner.</p>
      <p>Sunderland were unable to summon any response and Gillingham saw out the second period of extra-time without any problems whatsoever.</p>
