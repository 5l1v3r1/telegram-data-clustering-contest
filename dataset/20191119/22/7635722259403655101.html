      <h1>Wales win sets up Slovakia date for Ireland</h1>

        <b>Wonder no more! Slovakia will be Ireland's opponents in the Euro 2020 playoffs next March.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Boys in Green missed out on automatic qualification on Monday night after <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/player-ratings-ireland-v-denmark-926493"><b>drawing 1-1</b> </a>with Denmark.</p>
      <p>That meant Mick McCarthy's side would be heading to the playoffs. The only thing that wasn't clear however was who the opponents would be given the relevance of Tuesday night's results.</p>
      <p>The convoluted process which you can <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/soccer/ireland-permutations-euro-2020-915249"><b>read here</b></a> sees the UEFA Nations League playoffs playing a role in the qualification process.</p>
      <h3>Permutations</h3>
      <p>It was a little more complicated after the October results. But Ireland's fate <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/republic-ireland-euro-2020-play-off-permutations-926554"><b>became clearer</b></a> this morning.</p>
      <p>Ireland would have faced fellow Nations League B members Wales if the latter had lost to Hungary tonight.</p>
      <p>However, two goals from Aaron Ramsey tonight secured the Welsh's place in a second consecutive European championship.</p>
      <p>Wales' 2-0 home win put them second in qualifying Group E and sent them automatically to next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>Slovakia, also in Nations League B, beat Azerbaijan but stayed third in Group E.</p>
      <p>Of the teams not qualified automatically for Euro 2020 from the Nations League, the League B rankings were as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Slovakia</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Republic of Ireland</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Northern Ireland</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Given that first meets fourth and second plays third, Ireland will face a trip to Slovakia in the playoff semi-final.</p>
      <p>Win that and McCarthy's side will take on the winner of Bosnia and Northern Ireland's semi.</p>
