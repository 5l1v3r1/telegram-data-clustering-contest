      <h1>James Van Der Beek’s Wife Kimberly Says She Almost Died While Losing Another Pregnancy!</h1>

      <p>James Van Der Beek’s wife, Kimberly took to social media to share a very emotional video after he revealed she had miscarried their sixth baby! In the clip, the woman went more into detail about the horrible experience, revealing that she even nearly lost her life!</p>
      <p>James had talked about the tragedy a day before during an episode of Dancing with the Stars!</p>
      <p>Kimberly then took to her platform to share the video in which she shared more about the tragic experience that could have killed her as well, not just their unborn fetus!</p>
      <p>‘We lost our baby boy — by the way — and I almost lost my life, which is not a story that has been told. But at some point, I can dig into the details with you guys about what happened in the emergency room,’ the mom of five told her followers.</p>
      <p>The tragedy did not come alone, however, as the actor was also eliminated from the dancing competition since he and Ally Brooke landed in the last two spots.</p>
      <p>In the end, the judges chose to keep Ally in the competition, which meant that James had to go home.</p>
      <p>About this, Kimberly said in that same clip that ‘I’m pretty shocked. It is worth noting that Ally is a beautiful dancer and we love her like family. She tried to give her spot to James. She tried quitting the show, little angel. But yeah, I’m not really ready to talk further about everything yet, but at some point, I will.’</p>
      <p>This is not the first time the woman went through a miscarriage as she previously admitted to tragically losing three other pregnancies!</p>
