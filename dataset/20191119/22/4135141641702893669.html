      <p>Monday night on Raw, as NXT took over the red brand and stood tall following a tri-brand brawl, WWE COO Triple H dared any Raw and SmackDown Superstars who wanted more of NXT to show up on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The door is open. Will anyone from Raw or SmackDown walk through and take The Game up on his offer?</p>

      <p>After The Undisputed ERA crashed their SmackDown Tag Team Championship Match last Friday — costing them the opportunity to dethrone The New Day — The Revival will return to NXT tomorrow night looking for payback when they take on NXT Tag Team Champions Kyle O’Reilly &amp; Bobby Fish.</p>
      <p>Scott Dawson &amp; Dash Wilder were furious after the match, reminding The Undisputed ERA just who’s affairs they meddled in. Now, the former two-time NXT Tag Team Champions return to the black-and-gold brand. Will they show O’Reilly &amp; Fish what it means to be top guys, or will The Undisputed ERA give the SmackDown Superstars a preview of what lies ahead at Survivor Series?</p>
