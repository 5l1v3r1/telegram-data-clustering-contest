      <h1>Squarespace Seeks $400M Credit Line Ahead Of Potential IPO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:36:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Website services company Squarespace is reportedly seeking a $400 million credit facility, a move that generally precedes an <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/category/news/ipo/">initial public offering</a> (IPO), according to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/squarespace-is-said-to-mull-400-million-pre-ipo-credit-facility">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>The listing could happen in the year 2021, and Squarespace wants to get the credit facility settled before then. Unlike some other companies worth more than a billion dollars, Squarespace is cash-flow positive, which should bode well for its chances.</p>
      <p>The company received a valuation of $1.7 billion in December of 2017 after General Atlantic invested $200 million in the company. Other firms, including Accel and Index Ventures, have also invested.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2016/squarespace-rolls-out-beta-of-paypal-for-its-merchants/">Squarespace</a>’s advertising strategies vary from podcasts to the Super Bowl. Its main competitors are Wix.com and GoDaddy.com.</p>
      <p>The company has been steadily growing. In April, it acquired Acuity Scheduling, a platform to help small businesses manage appointments online. In October, it purchased Unfold, which is an app that allows users to create stories throughout all social media platforms.</p>
      <p>“As part of our pursuit to be the all-in-one platform for anyone who wants to stand out, we’re excited to welcome the publishers of Unfold into the Squarespace family,” Squarespace CEO Anthony Casalena <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/squarespace-acquires-unfold/">told a news outlet</a> in a statement at the time. “Whether building a business or personal brand, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/why-the-future-of-social-media-might-be-about-thinking-smaller/">social media</a> is a place where many creators get started before launching a website. As a first in our category, we’re excited to provide our customers with a way to stand out no matter how they are getting started.”</p>
      <p>The app is available for free, or a paid version is available at $2.99 a month. Squarespace said the app has been used to create over 700 million stories.</p>
      <p>Getting a credit facility from Wall Street can be fortuitous for both parties. A company will often reward a bank for pre-IPO help, and a bank will often offer better rates in return.</p>
