      <h1>'Should have backed him!' What the pundits are saying after Tottenham sacked Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>The Spurs boss' time at the club was brought to an end on Tuesday evening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jermaine Jenas has joined a host of media pundit in slamming the decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Argentine boss was dismissed by Daniel Levy after five years in charge on Tuesday night, much to the shock of the footballing world.</p>
      <p>Despite leading the club to their first-ever Champions League final a poor start to the 2019/20 season has left Spurs 14th in the Premier League table with 14 points from their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>With speculation mounting over the futures of Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, it's been a disrupted start to the season which has led to Pochettino's dismissal.</p>
      <p>The reaction from former players and the media has been strong, with ex-Spurs man Jenas coming out in supporter of Pochettino.</p>
      <p>He wrote on Twitter: "Shoulda backed him not sacked him! Gutted for Mauricio."</p>

      <p>Gary Lineker has weighed in on the decision too, claiming that there is no way Spurs will find a better replacement.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by <a href="https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial">@SpursOfficial</a> . He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement....ain’t gonna happen."</p>

      <p>However, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has admitted he felt Pochettino's Tottenham project had come to a natural end.</p>
      <p>The Sky Sports pundit praised the Argentine for a fantastic job but believed it was time for fresh blood at the north London club.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "I said a few weeks ago I felt this project had ran its course, I thought there would be a change at the end of the season with either the manager or players changing. Pochettino has been a brilliant manager for Spurs &amp; will be back in the PL sooner rather than later! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pochettino?src=hashtag_click">#pochettino</a> "</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, former Tottenham striker Allen told talkSPORT: “I’m very surprised. I was just very surprised at the timing. Obviously there has been the international break.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure Spurs supporters will say the results have not been what they were expecting this season. I do believe there has been reasons why that has happened.</p>
      <p>“I’m just really shocked and surprised. Where do Spurs go now?</p>
      <p>“I think it puts them under even more pressure. Obviously they are very disappointed with their league position at the moment. They’ve got a massive game coming up against West Ham at the weekend.“I’m just so surprised by the timing of it.</p>
      <p>“I think the significant thing is their results and results over this last calendar year. That certainly indicates to me that’s one of the reasons they’ve made the decision they have.</p>
      <p>“I think there’s no doubt the club have moved forward in terms of their structure and where they expecting to be, Champions League football is a must every season. Obviously there is question mark as to whether that is going to happen this season, so no doubt that is one of the factors.”</p>
