        <li>‘Proud Kiwi’ coach signs three-and-a-half-year deal</li>
        <li>Michael Cheika’s successor will take up post in July 2020</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dave Rennie will lead the Wallabies to the 2023 Rugby World Cup after being named as Michael Cheika’s replacement in charge of the national men’s team. The 55-year-old, who has signed a three-and-a-half year deal, becomes the second New Zealander to take on Australian rugby’s top coaching role.</p>
      <p>Given his current commitments with Scottish team Glasgow Warriors in the Pro14 competition, Rennie will not take the reins until July next year. Until then, Rugby Australia’s director of rugby, Scott Johnson, will oversee the rebuilding of the national team, including assembling a coaching staff, under Rennie’s direction.</p>
      <p>RA were seeking a new coach after Cheika opted to walk away from his post in the wake of a disappointing quarter-final finish at this year’s World Cup in Japan. Rennie arrives with a strong coaching record, having won two Super Rugby titles with New Zealand’s Chiefs in 2012 and 2013, and becomes the second foreigner to coach Australia, after fellow Kiwi Robbie Deans, who was in charge between 2008 and 2013.</p>
      <p>“I get it, I think Australians want their national team coached by an Australian and I’m OK with that,” said Rennie, who has not coached at international level before. “Hopefully, they’re feeling that way because they care about Aussie rugby and all I can say is everywhere I’ve gone I’ve immersed myself in the community and the culture.</p>
      <p>“There are some outstanding young men coming through the schools system. I want to create a strong connection with the Super Rugby and national age grade coaches and help them achieve their goals, which will benefit the Wallabies in time.”</p>
      <p>Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle said the organisation had looked “really hard” at homegrown options, but in the absence of any genuine Australian contenders they had to look elsewhere. Rennie was one of several overseas options, with his track record on the pitch and an ability to blend cultures in the dressing room key factors in his appointment.</p>
      <p>“This is a massive coup for Australian rugby, Dave Rennie was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we’re thrilled to have secured his services,” Castle said. “Dave’s coaching philosophy focuses equally on football and team culture, the key pillars to building sustainable success in any team. He has a proven track record in the northern and southern hemisphere.”</p>
      <p>Rennie was among 26 candidates identified by New Zealand Rugby as potential successors to All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen, who bowed out after their semi-final exit in Japan. With former Wales coach Warren Gatland ruling himself out and Jamie Joseph opting to extend his contract with Japan through to the next World Cup, the All Blacks’ choices are thinning.</p>
      <p>“I’m a proud Kiwi but the big thing is I’ve been talking to Australia for a lot of months and the All Blacks interest came in late in the piece,” said Rennie. “And by that stage, we’d done a lot of homework, we were really excited about the opportunity to go to Australia and that ended up being an easy decision.”</p>
      <p>The issue of a lack of world-class Australian coaches is something RA has identified as a problem, and Johnson has been tasked with developing young coaching talent in Australia over that over the next few years. “We’d like to get an Australian flavour there,” said Johnson. “It’s important that we get that. We have an obligation to get some young coaches through our system but we’ve got a lot of good young coaches coming through. They’re just not at the point that we need them at the pointy end now but the next cycle we need to have genuine contenders for this position coming through our system.”</p>
      <p>Rennie was seen as favourite to take over the Wallabies but a number of media pundits had urged RA to appoint a coach on a shorter deal after the governing body’s experience with Cheika. With Cheika negotiating a favourable contract extension through to Japan after the Wallabies reached the 2015 World Cup final, RA had little choice but to persist with him after the team slumped to their worst season in decades in 2018.</p>
      <p>A former Wellington centre, Rennie has Polynesian heritage and once represented a Cook Islands side in a non-capped match before carving out a coaching career with Wellington and later guiding the New Zealand Under-20 side. He joined the Warriors in 2017 from the Chiefs and guided the Scottish team to the Pro14 final at Celtic Park and the quarter-final of the Heineken Champions Cup last season.</p>
      <p>Scottish Rugby Chief Executive Mark Dodson congratulated him on his appointment. “He enhanced the strong, positive culture at Scotstoun and pushed the team to achieve significant results, playing some outstanding rugby on the way,” Dodson said. “He has conducted himself throughout with great professionalism and I know he will want to sign off his time in Glasgow with some silverware.”</p>
