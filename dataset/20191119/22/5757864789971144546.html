      <p>Just three months after a cotton candy lobster was caught off the coast of Maine, another Maine resident has reeled in one of the rare, colorful creatures.</p>
      <p>Kim Hartley <a href="https://www.wmtw.com/article/its-happened-again-rare-cotton-candy-lobster-caught-off-maine/29842578">told</a> WMTW that her husband caught the cotton candy lobster off Cape Rosier in Penobscot Bay—and it’s not his first time. Four years ago, he caught another one, which he donated to an aquarium in Connecticut. While the Hartleys decide what to do with their pretty new foster pet, it’s relaxing in a crate on land.</p>
      <p>Though the chances of finding a cotton candy lobster are supposedly one in 100 million, Maine seems to be crawling with the polychromatic crustaceans. <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/550536/fisherman-catches-cotton-candy-lobster-lucky">Lucky</a> the lobster gained quite a cult following on social media after being caught near Canada’s Grand Manan Island (close to the Canada-Maine border) last summer, and Portland restaurant <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmN-XASARek/">Scales</a> came across one during the same season. You can see a video of the discovery in Maine from last August below:</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/06/cotton-candy-blue-lobster-rare-animals/">According to</a> <i>National Geographic</i>, these lobsters’ cotton candy-colored shells could be the result of a genetic mutation, or they could be related to what they’re eating. Lobsters get their usual greenish-blue hue when <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/594817/why-lobsters-turn-bright-red-when-you-boil-them">crustacyanin</a>—a protein they produce—combines with astaxanthin, a bright red carotenoid found in their diet. But if the lobsters aren’t eating their usual astaxanthin-rich fare like crabs and shrimp, the lack of pigment could give them a pastel appearance. It’s possible that the cotton candy lobsters have been relying on fishermen’s bait as their main food source, rather than finding their own.</p>
      <p>While these vibrant specimens may look more beautiful than their dull-shelled relatives, even regular lobsters are cooler than you think—find out 25 fascinating facts about them <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57241/25-delicious-facts-about-lobsters">here</a>.</p>
