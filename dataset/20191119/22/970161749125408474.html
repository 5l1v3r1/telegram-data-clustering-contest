      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> star Dele Alli says he’s ‘grateful’ to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> for the impact the Argentine has had on his career.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was sacked on Tuesday after Daniel Levy, Spurs’ chairman, blamed the club’s ‘extremely disappointing’ for the decision.</p>
      <p>Pochettino spent five-and-a-half years in north London and Spurs qualified for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> four times during that period.</p>
      <p>His reign will be remembered for the side’s title push in 2015, as well as their run to the Champions League final in 2019.</p>
      <p>But his legacy of work with young players was also a strong factor and Alli, one of the main winners of Pochettino’s era, has thanked his now former boss.</p>

      <p>‘I can’t thank this man enough,’ said Alli.</p>
      <p>‘He’s taught me so much and I’m so grateful for everything he’s done for me. Good luck and hope to see you again my friend.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> is now the favourite to replace Pochettino in north London and the Portuguese is said to be keen on taking the role.</p>
      <p>He’s been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United in December 2018 but he retains a house in London and is keen on staying in England.</p>
