      <h1>HDK kin Radhakrishna is JD(S) candidate in CB'Pur</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:47:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dhns" target="_blank">DHNS</a></address>
      <p>The nomination paper of former legislator K P Bachegowda has been rejected, while that of N Radhakrishna has been accepted for Chikkaballapur Assembly constituency.</p>
      <p>Radhakrishna, who hails from Nagamangala in Shidlaghatta taluk in Chikkaballapur district, is JD(S) legislature party leader H D Kumaraswamy’s relative.</p>
      <p>Despite Bachegowda’s unwillingness, the party decided to field him. Late night on November 16, a decision was taken to field Radhakrishna, an industrialist. </p>
      <p>The next day, BJP nominee Dr K Sudhakar had claimed in a public meeting that Radhakrishna, an outsider to Chikkaballapur, would be the official candidate from the JD(S).</p>
      <p>Bachegowda had hit out at Sudhakar claiming that he would be the official candidate from the JD(S) and that he had already begun campaign in rural areas. </p>
      <p>On Monday, Bachegowda and Radhakrishna were present at the procession before filing nomination papers. While leading the procession, Kumaraswamy had said that a decision would be taken regarding the party’s official candidate soon.</p>
      <p>Soon after nomination paper was rejected, Bachegowda and Radhakrishna told reporters that a decision was taken to field Radhakrishna as Bachegowda was unwilling to contest.</p>
      <p>Bachegowda said that leaders had forced him to enter the fray despite his unwillingness, while Radhakrishna said that he would face the bypoll under the guidance of Bachegowda and Kumaraswamy.</p>
