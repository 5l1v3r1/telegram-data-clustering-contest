      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Cliff Parisi, who played Minty on EastEnders, has revealed he said yes to going into the jungle because of money worries</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Cliff Parisi, known to millions as Minty from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/eastenders">EastEnders</a> , is not minted, and says he is going into the jungle because he needs the money.</p>
      <p>The actor, 59, has admitted that he initially turned down the job until he was shown a huge tax bill by his accountant, which changed his mind.</p>
      <p>Cliff said: “What made me sign up? The taxman. I have got a bill I need to pay.</p>
      <p>"Like everyone at this time of year, you go, ‘Oh no. Again...' You would think I earn a lot of money but I don’t.</p>
      <p>"I work for the BBC, so it ain’t that big.</p>

      <p>“I had a meeting about this earlier on in the year, and I thought about it long and hard and said no.</p>
      <p>"And then as I got an estimate for my tax, I phoned them up and said, is it too late to say yes?</p>
      <p>“So here I am. But it could be an amazing experience and I hope it is.</p>
      <p>“Life throws up things like this for you, and if you don’t take them you are a bit of a mug.</p>
      <p>So I give myself a bit of a talking to, and then I spoke to the accountant and he made my mind up.</p>
      <p>What is the worse-case scenario? A big snake is gonna bite you or the taxman is gonna bite you. Which do you want?”</p>

      <p>Cliff, who quit EastEnders in 2010 and has since starred regularly in BBC drama Call The Midwife, will go into the jungle as a late entry tomorrow, alongside <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> actor Andy Whyment, who plays Kirk Sutherland on the soap.</p>
      <p>Cliff started off as a stand-up comic,, but soon appeared as an actor in The Darling Buds of May and Drop the Dead Donkey.</p>
      <p>He then landed bigger parts in Kavanagh QC, Bramwell and A Prince Among Men, before being cast as Minty in EastEnders in 2002, a role he played for eight years.</p>

      <p>Cliff admitted he has not watched the show since he left.</p>
      <p>He said: “I loved working there, but I think that in life you’ve got to move forward and do different things.</p>
      <p>"Although I do miss the people there, I’m happy doing what I’m doing. I love Call the Midwife. It’s a new family.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he would ever return, he said: “Never say never. If there was a time that financially I needed to do it and they offered it to me and it was an interesting enough storyline, I’d consider it.”</p>
      <p>Cliff admitted that he had some concerns about the famously meagre jungle rations.</p>

      <p>He said: “I obviously like my food, so this might be a bit of a struggle for me.</p>
      <p>"But, I like challenges, so let’s just see. I’d love to lose a couple of stone – that’d be incredible.”</p>
      <p>The star also said he would miss his family during his time Down Under. Cliff has son Arthur, nine, with wife Tara Wyer, a BBC production assistant.</p>
      <p>He said he told Arthur: “I said, Daddy’s going away for a while and it’s going to be an adventure. I’m going to miss you and I love you.”</p>

      <p>Cliff also has daughter Mandy, 37, and sons Dean, 31, and Jack 27, from previous relationships.</p>
      <p>And he said Tara offered some helpful hints for his time in the jungle.</p>
      <p>He said: “My wife’s written a long list out of things I mustn’t do.</p>
      <p>"Like scratching my bum, picking my nose, farting – all the disgusting things men do – scratching your nuts.</p>
      <p>"I’m sure I’ll forget from time to time and I’ll have to have manners.”</p>
