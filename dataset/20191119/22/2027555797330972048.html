      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:52:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/t-r-satish-kumar" target="_blank">T R Satish Kumar</a></address>
      <p>Following the brutal attack on MLA Tanveer Sait on Sunday night, the police has suspended his gunman Fairoz Khan on Tuesday. Khan belongs to the City Reserve Police.</p>
      <p>Taking cognisance of the incident, City Commissioner of Police K T Balakrishna has suspended the gunman, citing negligence to provide security to the Narasimharaja MLA of the Congress.</p>
      <p>Sait was attacked by Farhaan Pasha with a knife, during a wedding ceremony at Bal Bhavan in the city. He was rushed to a private hospital where he was immediately operated upon. The accused was immediately rounded up, thrashed and handed over to the police. Several persons recorded the incident on their mobile phones.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the police apprehended five more persons — Abid Pasha, Noor Khan, Mujeeb, Akram and Mujamil — all in their 30s, in connection with the case. They are said to be activists of PFI and SDPI. The police are on the lookout for more persons involved in the case.</p>
      <p>Sait’s condition better</p>
      <p>Sait is responding to the treatment and is recovering in the ICU of the Colombia Asia Hospital. Speaking with mediapersons, Dr Upendra Shenoy said, on Tuesday, the MLA sat in a chair for some time and had food. “The MLA was having visitors. He will be under observation in the ICU for a couple of days. He might be in the hospital for at least five days,” he said.</p>
      <p>The wound near the neck was 2-inch deep. “The sutures are around eight inches long. The lower part of the ear, which has suffered a cut, has been joined. He has survived by a whisker. The MLA is confident and energetic. He is recovering,” the doctor said.</p>
