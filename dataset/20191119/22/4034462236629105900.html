      <h1>Karma Stuns In LA With 1,100-HP SC2 Concept Car</h1>
      <h2>0-60 mph takes just 1.9 seconds. Watch out, Tesla!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:10:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this month, Karma, makers of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/karma/revero-gt">Revero GT</a>, teased a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/karma-teases-new-sports-car-concept-with-dramatic-design">major reveal for the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show</a>. We knew it would be called the SC2 Concept and it would be targeted directly at the upcoming <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/roadster">Tesla Roadster</a>. The Karma SC2 Concept has now made its official debut in LA and the specifications feel like they came from a video game.</p>
      <p>Front and rear-mounted twin electric motors combine to deliver 1,100 horsepower and 10,500 lb-ft of torque. Yes, you read those figures correctly. These motors can rocket the car up to 60 mph in a scarcely believable 1.9 seconds while the 120kWh battery provides a massive 350 miles of all-electric range. Karma has also equipped the SC2 with carbon-ceramic brakes, a push-rod operated racing suspension, and a torque-vectoring gearbox. So, who can we make our check out to?</p>

      <p>"SC2 presents an optimistic and bold message about Karma's future as we enthusiastically accept the challenge of elevating experience-driven mobility," says Karma VP, Global Design and Architecture, Andreas Thurner. "In creating SC2, we have enhanced the thrill of the open road through connected, interactive patented technology, beyond that of a traditional high-performance luxury vehicle."</p>
      <p>Karma has also created a new feature called Drive and Play, which uses a triple high definition camera under the windshield and frequency frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) lidar sensors to track your favorite drives and replay them while the vehicle is stationary. An adaptive laser projector replays the drive while a smartphone acts as the cabin's rear-view mirror, turning the SC2 into a driving simulator. All of this sounds pretty special but just remember, this is only a concept car and Karma has not announced any immediate plans to put it into production.</p>

      <p>Joining the SC2 at the LA Auto Show is a car you can actually buy, the 2020 Revero GTS. This new performance variant of the Revero will be available starting in the first quarter of 2020 and includes a wealth of upgrades over the standard model. It still uses dual electric motors paired with a Twin Power turbocharged three-cylinder engine acting as a generator to provide 80 miles of electric range and 360 miles of total range. Drivers can select from three drive modes including Stealth (pure EV), Sustain (a range extender), and Sport (maximum driving performance)</p>
      <p>With launch control, Karma says the Revero GTS can hit 60 mph in just 3.9 seconds and can go on to a limited top speed of 130 mph. Karma has now opened pre-orders for the Revero GTS with prices starting at <b>$149,950</b>. Following the GTS in 2020, Karma will reveal an all-new global platform in 2021.</p>
