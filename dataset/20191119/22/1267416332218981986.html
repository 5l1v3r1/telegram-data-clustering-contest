      <p>Every year, The Game Awards is held in Los Angeles to honour some of the most notable achievements in the video game industry.</p>
      <p>Developers are given awards for their games, not unlike the Oscars or Golden Globes, while new looks at games are revealed as well. Notably, the show is produced by Toronto-born journalist and entrepreneur Geoff Keighley.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Keighley revealed the nominees for 2019’s ceremony.</p>

      <p>As in previous years, there are a number of Canadian-made games that have been recognized.</p>
      <p>First and foremost is<a href="https://www.gears5.com/"> <i>Gears 5</i></a>, Xbox’s biggest exclusive of the year. The third-person shooter game was developed by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/08/30/gears-5-the-coalition-vancouver-interview/">Vancouver-based The Coalition</a> and has been nominated for Best Action Game, Best Audio Design and Best Performance (for actress Laura Bailey as main character Kait).</p>
      <p>Three other Vancouver studios were also shown some love. Nominated for Best Score/Music was <a href="https://braceyourselfgames.com/">Brace Yourself Games</a>‘ <i><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-featuring-the-legend-of-zelda-switch/">Cadence of Hyrule</a>, </i>a <i>Zelda </i>and <i>Crypt of the Necrodancer </i>crossover exclusive for the Nintendo Switch that was composed by Danny Baranowsky. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.nextlevelgames.com/">Next Level Games</a>‘ Switch exclusive action-adventure game <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/31/luigis-mansion-3-ghostbusting-dungeon-crawling/"><i>Luigi’s Mansion 3</i></a> is up for Best Family Game. Finally, <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-20"><i>FIFA 20</i></a> — this year’s entry in <a href="https://www.ea.com/careers/careers-overview/vancouver">EA Vancouve</a>r’s ever-popular soccer franchise– was nominated for Best Sports/Racing game.</p>
      <p>Moving across the province, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/07/04/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-ps4-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-review/"><i>Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</i></a>, Quebec City-based <a href="https://beenox.com/en/">Beenox</a>‘s remake of the classic PlayStation <i>Crash Bandicoot</i> racing game, is also up for Best Sports/Racing. Another Quebec-made game, <a href="https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/">Ubisoft Montreal</a>‘s <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-ca/home/"><i>Rainbow Six: Siege</i></a>, has been nominated for Best Community Support.</p>
      <p>It’s not surprising that several Canadian titles have been nominated, given that Canada is <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2017/10/24/canada-video-game-industry-innovation/">the third-largest producer of video games in the world</a>, after the U.S. and Japan. Moreover, a recent report from The Entertainment Software Association of Canada revealed that the Canadian gaming industry<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/18/canadian-video-game-industry-2019-report/"> now contributes $4.5 billion CAD to the country’s GDP</a>.</p>
      <p>For what it’s worth, while no Canadian games have made the list, here are the games up for the coveted Game of the Year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Control (Remedy Entertainment)</li>
        <li>Death Stranding (Kojima Productions)</li>
        <li>The Outer Worlds (Obsidian Entertainment)</li>
        <li>Resident Evil 2 (Capcom)</li>
        <li>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (From Software)</li>
        <li>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Sora, Ltd.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s important to note that <i><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-review/">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, </i>Nintendo’s massive 2018 crossover fighter, is being recognized this year because it released in early December, just a couple of weeks <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq-rules-2017/">after last year’s cutoff date</a>.</p>
      <p>The Game Awards nominees are selected by <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq">a jury made up of dozens of gaming media and influencer outlets</a> from around the world. Winners, meanwhile, are determined by a combination of the jury’s votes (90 percent) and fan votes (10 percent).</p>
      <p>Those interested in voting can do so on <a href="https://thegameawards.com/nominees">The Game Awards’ website</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=TGA+vote">on Google</a>.</p>
      <p>This year’s Game Awards ceremony will take place on December 12th at 8:30pm ET at LA’s Microsoft Theater. The event <a href="https://thegameawards.com/watch">will be livestreamed online</a>.</p>
