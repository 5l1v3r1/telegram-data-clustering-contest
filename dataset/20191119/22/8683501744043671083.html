      <p>The DC live-action universe is an ever changing place, as Warner Bros. is constantly adjusting its schedule based on each new release. The original plans for the DCEU changed quite a bit since its inception, following the disappointing performance of <i>Justice League</i>. The studio pivoted toward director-driven stories rather than crossover-heavy ensemble projects, and Ben Affleck departed his role as Batman. There were some reports that Henry Cavill was going to retire as Superman as well, but now it looks like he's not given up his superheroic role yet.</p>
      <p>Henry Cavill was the first hero to stop onto the DCEU, debuting as Clark Kent/Superman in <i>Man of Steel</i>. He reprised his role in <i>Batman v Superman</i> and <i>Justice League</i>, but there haven't been any updates regarding if/when he'd done the cape again. And while rumors swirled moths ago that he was done playing the The Last Son of Krypton, Cavill recently spoke the possibility of returning, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>I’m not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on. I’ve not given up the role. There’s a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That’s important to me. There’s a lot of justice to be done for Superman. The status is: You’ll see.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, that's perfectly cryptic. While Henry Cavill didn't give a concrete answer regarding when he might play Superman, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462978/the-hilarious-way-simon-pegg-poked-fun-at-henry-cavill-while-filming-mission-impossible---fallout">the <i>Mission: Impossible – Fallout</i> actor</a> does seem committed to donning the cape one day in the future.</p>
      <p>Henry Cavill's comments to <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29774618/henry-cavill-the-witcher-superman-interview/">Men's Health</a> are sue to excite the DC fans out there. Much of the DCEU's plans for the future were abandoned after <i>Justice League</i> failed to perform a the box office. This includes the <i>Justice League</i> sequel, <i>Cyborg</i> movie, and <i>Flashpoint</i>. Henry Cavill hasn't signed on to another flick, and was noticeably absent for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479239/shazam-set-photo-reveals-henry-cavills-superman-stand-in">Superman's cameo in <i>Shazam!</i></a> But it looks like he hasn't given up, and will hopefully play Clark Kent again. This time <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482210/new-justice-league-set-photo-includes-henry-cavills-infamous-mustache">without a mustache</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2457477/warner-bros-responds-to-henry-cavill-superman-departure-rumors">Rumors about Henry Cavill's departure</a> from the DCEU began over a year ago, in September of last year. It was reported that Cavill would no longer be playing Superman in the DCEU, following suit after <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468152/ben-affleck-was-amused-by-zack-snyders-response-to-his-batman-exit">Ben Affleck hung up the cowl</a>. Cavill responded those rumors <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2457467/henry-cavill-responds-to-superman-rumors-in-the-most-bizarre-possible-way">with a mysterious video</a>, but neither confirmed nor denied his departure. Now it looks like his contract is still binding, and that he'd like to return to his superhero role. But exactly when and how remains a mystery.</p>
      <p>Hopefully some answers will come soon regarding Henry Cavill's future in the DCEU, and the long awaited return of Superman. But with the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485004/despite-the-snyder-cut-going-viral-warner-bros-reportedly-isnt-moving-forward-anytime-soon">campaign for the Snyder Cut</a> of <i>Justice League</i> only continuing to gain momentum, perhaps we'll see Superman return in that way first. Only time will tell.</p>
      <p>The next installment in the DCEU is <i>Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i> on February 7th.
