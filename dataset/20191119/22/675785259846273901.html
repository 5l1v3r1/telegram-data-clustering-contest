      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Scotland Yard is under pressure to release logs kept by royal protection officers which would clarify whether Prince Andrew was in Pizza Express or Tramp nightclub on a day back in March 2001</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:31:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Sommerlad, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nick-sommerlad/</a></address>
      <p>Police notebooks could hold the truth about the Prince Andrew sex claims.</p>
      <p>There are calls for Scotland Yard to release the logs kept by royal protection officers. One of the former officers Paul Page said notes would include times and dates of any trips to Pizza Express and Tramp nightclub.</p>
      <p>He said: “If the notebooks can be found they would clear it up.”</p>
      <p>The Met said the pocket logs were kept for up to 30 years.</p>
      <p>In a TV interview shown at the weekend, Andrew denied the allegations of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s sex slave Virginia Roberts who claims she was trafficked to London in March 2001 aged 17 to have sex with Andrew.</p>
      <p>She alleges she and the duke danced at the nightclub then had sex.</p>

      <p>The prince said he was at Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey, that afternoon and spent the rest of the evening at home with his daughters.</p>
      <p>Mr Page, who served in the SO14 Royalty Protection command from 1998 to 2004, said: “Prince Andrew would have been accompanied everywhere... A visit to Pizza Express would be noted in the pocket book... Tramp nightclub, individual venues and personal residences.”</p>
      <p>Mr Page has cast doubt on Andrew’s sweat claims.</p>
      <p>Virginia, now 35, alleges Andrew, 59, had perspired profusely. But the prince says he had a condition at that time which meant he did not sweat.</p>

      <p>Mr Page, however, said he saw the prince perspiring while playing golf in the garden at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>Mr Page, who was convicted in 2009 over a £3million investment fraud, insisted he did not have a grudge against the duke but added the prince was “abusive and rude towards us as police officers”. He said about the TV interview: “[Andrew] made a compelling suspect.</p>
      <p>“If that was a police interview he’d have been in the back of the van.”</p>
      <p>The Palace said previously that during Mr Page’s trial he made “a series of allegations about... members of the Royal Family, none of which were ever substantiated”.</p>
