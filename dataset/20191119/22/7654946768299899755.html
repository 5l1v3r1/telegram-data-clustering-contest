      <h1>New Zealand massacre manifesto sent to Syracuse students amid racist episodes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:46:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author">Bernadette Hogan and Kenneth Garger</a></address>
      <p>A white supremacist manifesto reportedly authored by the suspect behind the Christchurch, New Zealand, mass shooting was believed to be electronically distributed to students at Syracuse University early Tuesday — the latest in a series of racist episodes <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/syracuse-suspends-frat-activities-after-series-of-racist-anti-semitic-incidents/">to rock the campus</a>.</p>
      <p>The university’s Department of Public Safety <a href="https://dps.syr.edu/2019/11/19/public-safety-informational-notice-dps-investigating-reports-of-document-allegedly-shared-via-airdrop/">said it was investigating reports</a> of students at a campus library receiving the document on their cellphones via an electronic file transfer service called AirDrop.</p>
      <p>Officials noted the reports haven’t been confirmed and there is “no specific threat” to the university. But they said they’ve alerted the FBI, state police and the Syracuse Police Department.</p>
      <p>The school newspaper, the Daily Orange, <a href="http://dailyorange.com/2019/11/white-supremacist-manifesto-allegedly-airdropped-students-dps-says/">reported the alleged manifesto</a> is the same 74-page document written by Muslim-hating Brenton Tarrant, who’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/15/suspected-new-zealand-mosque-shooter-hoped-to-spark-civil-war-in-us/">accused of slaughtering 49 people</a> at two New Zealand mosques in March.</p>
      <p>There have been 11 reported hate crimes at Syracuse University since Nov. 7, the Daily Orange said.</p>
      <p>The racist and anti-Semitic incidents led the university on Sunday to suspend all fraternity life.</p>
      <p>The DPS had said a black female student reported “being verbally harassed” Saturday night by a group yelling a racial epithet as she walked by.</p>
      <p>Following Tuesday’s incident, Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the university’s board of trustees to hire an outside monitor to investigate the “surge of campus hate crimes.”</p>
      <p>“The hateful activities at Syracuse University are most disturbing, not only to the Syracuse University community, but to the greater community of New York,” Cuomo said in a press release.</p>
      <p>“That these actions should happen on the campus of a leading New York university makes this situation even worse.”</p>
      <p>Cuomo was also critical of chancellor Kent Syverud’s handling of the incidents and said, “They have not been handled in a manner that reflects this state’s aggressive opposition to such odious, reckless, reprehensible behavior.”</p>
