      <h1>Even Minor Hearing Loss Can Lead To Cognitive Decline, Study Finds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:05:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/abby-moore" target="_blank">mbg Editorial Assistant</a></address>
      <p>Temperatures have dropped, and winter coats are no longer in storage, so if you're anything like us, Christmas music is already blasting through your noise-canceling headphones.</p>
      <p>We're not trying to be grinches, but a recent study conducted by Columbia University might convince you to turn down the volume. </p>
      <p>A study published in <i>JAMA Otolaryngology—Head &amp; Neck Surgery</i> analyzed data from 6,451 adults who underwent <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2755646?guestAccessKey=3e4572b6-0e7a-4d5e-939b-f162fc58498b&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=111419">hearing and cognitive testing</a>. For every 10 decibels (dB) lost, cognitive function also declined. </p>
      <p>People in the early stages of hearing loss—just 10 dB below "perfect hearing"—showed the largest decrease in cognitive ability.</p>
      <p>Research has previously linked <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323321">hearing loss to cognitive decline</a>, but the studies were performed only on adults with clinically diagnosed hearing loss (aka those who are unable to hear sounds below 25 dB). For reference, 25 dB includes a standard whisper or the sound of rustling leaves.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.entcolumbia.org/profile/golubj">Justin S. Golub, M.D.</a>, leader of the study, said that hearing loss has been linked to social isolation, depression, cognitive decline, and even dementia. "Hearing loss is not benign," Golub said. "[It] should be treated. This study suggests, the earlier, the better." </p>
      <p>While the study found a connection between hearing loss and cognitive decline, it did not conclude why the two were related. "It's possible that people who don't hear well tend to socialize less and, as a result, they tend to have fewer stimulating conversations," Golub said. </p>
      <p>The National Institutes of Health are funding a study now to see if hearing aids can delay cognitive decline and hopefully prevent dementia. </p>
      <p>Helpful as they may be, hearing aids probably aren't at the top of your list this holiday season. If you're looking to unwrap something a little more exciting, our <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/gift-guide">gift guide</a> is a good place to start! </p>
