      <p>A northern Victorian family is at a loss to understand why anyone would target their pet dog after the two-year-old was viciously stabbed to death and sprayed with a possible poison.</p>
      <p>The kelpie and border collie cross, Ezra, was stabbed four times in the chest and abdomen at the Symons' property at Glen Creek, about 50 kilometres south of Albury, on Monday.</p>
      <p>The pet was taken to a vet in Beechworth but died on an operating table the following day.</p>

      <p>Owner Rhiannon Symons, 19, said she was devastated and heartbroken, and struggling to understand why the placid dog had been killed.</p>

      <p>"I've been really lost the last few days," she said.</p>
      <p>"It just makes me sick to the stomach that someone could do this and I've lost her in such a traumatic way."</p>
      <p>Ms Symons said Ezra was friendly, didn't bark, and loved attention.</p>
      <p>Family members have no enemies and police are investigating if it's a case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>Ms Symons had heard a yelp and went outside the Tunnel Gap Road home, <a href="https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/6501306/police-appeal-for-witnesses-over-glen-creek-dog-stabbing/?cs=9681">the Border Mail reported</a>.</p>
      <p>She saw a man in a dark blue or navy Subaru wagon, with a loud exhaust and no number plates, outside.</p>
      <p>Her pet was badly wounded and had a sticky substance, possibly weed killer, on its face.</p>
      <p>Dederang Leading Senior Constable Craig Lee said Ms Symons had given a good description of the vehicle, which had black wheels and black roof racks.</p>
      <p>"It's an absolutely despicable act, a disgusting thing to do," he said.</p>
      <p>"They're a nice family. I can't see the motivation behind it, whether it's mistaken identity and they've got the wrong house. I'd ask the community to report anything they might know about the matter to police."</p>
      <p>The offender got out of the passenger side of the wagon, which suggests more than one person was involved.</p>
      <p>The vehicle was last seen heading towards Myrtleford.</p>
      <p>Myrtleford officers rushed to the scene but the car could not be found.</p>
      <p>Leading Senior Constable Lee hopes members of the public have security vision, dash camera footage, or saw the car on the side of the road having the plates added or removed.</p>
      <p>Darryl Symons wanted to ask the attackers why they did it, and fears they might return.</p>
      <p>"We're just stumped ... we've got no idea," he said.</p>
      <p>"I just can't comprehend it. It's sickening, just the severity of the attack."</p>
