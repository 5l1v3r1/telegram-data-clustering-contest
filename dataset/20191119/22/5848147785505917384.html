      <h1>Energy prices a cause of stress as summer looms</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:10:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/killian-plastow/" target="_blank">Killian Plastow</a></address>
      <p>The cost of keeping cool is a big worry for many as energy prices continue to squeeze Australian households.</p>
      <p>A whopping 96 per cent of Australians are worried about the cost of energy, according to a new survey of just over 1000 Australians, conducted on behalf of Mitsubishi Electric.</p>
      <p>Additionally, 88 per cent of respondents said they were concerned by the effect their energy consumption has on the environment.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi Electric Australia’s executive director Jeremy Needham said the latest numbers showed Australians are increasingly concerned by their use of energy on a number of fronts.</p>
      <p>“With our collective environmental consciousness becoming ever more socially important, attitudes towards energy efficiency and sustainability are stronger than ever before,” Mr Needham said.</p>
      <p>“Year on year we are seeing variations of new and emerging trends as generations change, new technologies and innovations take hold and society evolves.”</p>
      <h3>Cost pressure flat but high</h3>
      <p>Kirsty Lamont – money expert with consumer comparison site Mozo – told <i>The New Daily</i> that energy costs as a percentage of average annual income has been relatively stable between 4.1 per cent and 4.4 per cent over the past three years.</p>
      <p>But, Ms Lamont noted, that’s still higher than the 2.6 per cent that Australians were paying only a decade ago.</p>
      <p>“It’s quite interesting; over the last 12 months, electricity prices have actually decreased slightly in many parts of Australia, and that’s due to <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/consumer/2019/06/30/july-1-energy-changes/">regulation changes that have made pricing fairer</a> in many markets,” Ms Lamont said.</p>
      <p>“But the trouble is many households are still feeling significant pressure from stagnant wage growth and the costs of living, so energy continues to be a huge source of bill pain for many households, which I expect to continue for many years to come.”</p>
      <p>Those regulatory changes have been positive for many, but even with with the improvement in energy pricing Ms Lamont said the average household can still save “around $544 a year” by shopping around and switching providers.</p>
      <p>Consumers should be reviewing their energy providers every 12 months, Ms Lamont said, and those on the best deal already – or who simply want to save a little extra – can still reduce their bill by being a little smarter about the consumption.</p>
      <h3>Be more efficient</h3>
      <p>Tracking your energy usage can help you identify ways to cut down on your energy use, Ms Lamont said.</p>
      <p>There are a range of apps and services – including the government’s <a href="https://www.energymadeeasy.gov.au/benchmark">energy use calculator</a> – that allow consumers to calculate how much energy they use or how their consumption compares to a benchmark.</p>
      <h3>Be temperature smart</h3>
      <p>Increasing or lowering the temperature of your house by one degree can add 10 per cent to the running cost of a heater or air-conditioner, so the smaller the temperature gap between the outside and inside of a home, the cheaper the bill will be.</p>
      <p>For cooling, Ms Lamont advised using a fan instead of air-conditioning whenever possible.</p>
      <p>“Fans are a lot more energy efficient than air-conditioners,” she said.</p>
      <p>“So a good rule of thumb is to try and use a fan unless the temperature is over 30 degrees, and you should find that that will be enough to cool the house without using your air-con.”</p>
      <h3>Be fast when taking a shower</h3>
      <p>Taking a warm shower not only uses a lot of water, but adds to a household’s energy bills too.</p>
      <p>By keeping showers under four minutes long, Ms Lamont said, consumers can save on water and energy.</p>
      <h3>Be smart with appliances</h3>
      <p>Household appliances account for 30 per cent of a home’s energy consumption, so it makes sense for consumers to buy energy-efficient appliances when replacing their old products.</p>
      <p>Leaving appliances switched on at the outlet also adds to energy consumption, even when the plugged-in device has been turned off.</p>
      <p>“Many appliances continue to use energy even when switched off on the machine because they’re still in standby power mode, and that can add up quickly,” Ms Lamont said.</p>
      <p>Appliances in stand-by mode can add up to 3 per cent of a household’s energy use.</p>
      <p>“Other than fridges and freezers, it’s worth switching off most appliances at the wall to save on power,” Ms Lamont said.</p>
