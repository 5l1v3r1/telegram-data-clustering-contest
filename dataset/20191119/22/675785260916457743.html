      <h1>Beyonce horsefly, Kate Winslet beetle and other animals named after celebrities</h1>
      <h2>From Beyonce to Freddie Mercury, we we take a look at the celebs who have been named after species</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:36:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p>Actor Idris Elba must be buzzing. He has had a ­species of wasp named after him – joining fine company including a horse fly ­inspired by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/beyonce">Beyonce</a> .</p>
      <p>The Mirror told yesterday how the wasp has been likened to Elba’s character Heimdall in the Thor films – as a superhero for farmers that will wipe out a damaging pest.</p>
      <p>With an estimated 17,000 to 24,000 species being discovered every year, scientists are having to get creative with their naming techniques – and where better to look than our favourite stars.</p>
      <p>So from bootylicious flies to a frog prince, we take a look at other species that pay homage to celebs.</p>

      <p>The ninja lanternshark snapped up the scientific name of Emopterus benchleyi after the author of Jaws, Peter Benchley.</p>
      <p>Not only did he come up with the shark horror but he also worked hard as a marine conservationist.</p>

      <p>Every single member of the band Queen has been honoured by having a species of damselfly named after them as part of their 40th anniversary.</p>
      <p>The species were christened Heteragrion freddiemercuryi, H. brianmayi, H.rogertaylori, and H. johndeaconi.</p>

      <p>In 2012, a species of tree frog was named after Prince Charles as a thanks for his work in protecting their rainforest habitat.</p>
      <p>We're sure he'd have been hoppy with such a lovely surprise.</p>

      <p>The Scaptia beyonceae horse fly, which is found only in Queensland, Australia, was named after the queen of pop due to “the unique dense golden hairs on the fly’s abdomen”.</p>
      <p>The horse fly is completely black apart from it’s golden behind, which reminds researchers of the song Bootylicious.</p>

      <p>Cleese had an endangered species of lemur named after him in 2005 as a tribute to his conservation work.</p>
      <p>He was really touched the animal had been named Avahi cleesei, and said he was “absurdly fond of the little creatures”.</p>

      <p>She’s known for always being glamorous – even admitting to sleeping with her makeup on.</p>
      <p>The country singer gave her name to pretty lichen, called Japewiella dollypartoniana, as it grows in the Tennessee mountains where she grew up.</p>

      <p>The group were rewarded for their conservation efforts by having an ant named after them, Sericomyrmex radioheadi.</p>
      <p>The scientists who made the discovery described the band as “an excellent companion during long hours at the microscope”,</p>

      <p>The Agra katewinsletae insect was named after Kate thanks to her role in the Titanic.</p>
      <p>Scientists said: “Her character didn’t go down with the ship, but we’ll not be able to say the same for this species if the rainforest is converted to pastures.”</p>

      <p>The Desis bobmarleyi marine spider was named because of its high tide/low tide habitat – just like the reggae star’s song High Tide Or Low Tide.</p>
      <p>Sadly though, it isn’t able to grow the same luscious dreadlocks as its namesake.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Just like the actor, this beetle is known for its muscular legs.</p>
      <p>The middle femora in the male Agra schwarzeneggeri looks like the spider could have been hitting the gym as much as the Terminator star himself.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The scientist who discovered the Conobregma bradpitti wasp was such a fan of Brad Pitt that she had a poster of him in her lab.</p>
      <p>So it seemed only fitting to name the creepy-crawly after the Hollywood star.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Lady Gaga has a full genus of 19 different kinds of fern named after her – including Gaga germanotta and Gaga monstraparva, which translates to “little monsters”, the name that the singer gives to her fans.</p>
      <p>To top it off, the plants’ DNA sequence also spells out GwAGA.</p>

        <figcaption>Shakira</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the Aleiodes shakirae parasite was named after the singer because it can shake its hips vigorously.</p>
      <p>The tiny creature usually attaches itself to caterpillars and makes its host twist and squirm via its abdomen.</p>
