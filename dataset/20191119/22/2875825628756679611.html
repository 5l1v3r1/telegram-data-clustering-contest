      <p>"Kimberly would go into the ladies' closets. Some of these are like 2,000 square feet - they're huge. Beverly Hills ladies.</p>
      <p>"They figure out what they want to get rid of and Kimberley has an Ebay sight.. Kimberly sells them for them and gets 30% commission."</p>
      <p>Adele then asked whether Caitlyn helped Kanye when he moved from music to fashion.</p>

      <p>"I’ve never quit at anything I’ve ever done and I’m thinking maybe it’s time I learned how to do that."</p>
