      <h1>Ireland's Euro 2020 play-off semi-final opponent confirmed as Slovakia</h1>
      <h2>Mick McCarthy's men will face Slovakia in March - and then either Northern Ireland or Bosnia if they progress - for Euro 2020 qualification</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:00:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Ireland will play Slovakia away in their Euro 2020 playoff semi-final in March.<br/><br/>And the winner of that one-legged tie will meet either Northern Ireland or Bosnia in a one-off final for a spot at the finals,<br/><br/>UEFA have to officially rubber-stamp the fixtures today, before holding a draw in Switzerland on Friday to determine who is at home in the final.<br/><br/>And that decider could be an All-Island battle between north and south at either Windsor Park or Aviva Stadium.<br/><br/>But the Boys in Green will have to negotiate Slovakia first and that game will be played in either Bratislava or Trnava.</p>
      <p>March 26 and 31 have been earmaked as the semi-final and final dates, but UEFA has yet to confirm match details</p>
      <p>Ireland have played Slovakia five times before, winning once and drawing the other four games.<br/><br/>Four of those matches were competitive. Kevin Doyle scored a winner for Steve Staunton’s Ireland at Croke Park in the first ever meeting in 2007.</p>

      <p>The return leg at the Tehelne Pole Stadion in Bratislava was a 2-2 draw but best remembered in the build-up for Stephen Ireland’s ‘Grannygate’ shenaningans.<br/><br/>Under Giovanni Trapattoni, Ireland drew 1-1 away and 0-0 at home with Slovakia on their way to Euro 2012.<br/><br/>And the most recent meeting was a 2-2 friendly draw at Aviva Stadium under Martin O’Neill three years ago.<br/><br/>In this Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, Slovakia finished third in their group behind table-toppers Croatia and second-placed Wales, winning four of their eight games and losing three.<br/><br/>They scored 13 goals in the process and conceded 11, losing heavily home and away to Croatia while also going down 1-0 to Wales in Cardiff but holding them to a draw at home.<br/><br/>Like Ireland, Slovakia - who are ranked 31st in the world - last featured at a major tournament at Euro 2016.<br/><br/>In France, they lost to Germany in the second round having qualified for the knockout stages as one of the best third-placed teams in a group behind England, Wales and Russia.</p>
