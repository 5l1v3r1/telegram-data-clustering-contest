      <h1>The John McGinn and Steven Naismith dream team Steve Clarke is backing to fire Scotland to Euro 2020</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder got his seventh goal in six Scotland games and Clarke is thrilled to see a partnership developing with Steven Naismith.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:51:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author">David McCarthy, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/david-mccarthy/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Clarke has tipped talisman <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> to blast Scotland to Euro 2020 after another sensational show at Hampden last night.</p>
      <p>The Aston Villa midfielder hoisted his international tally to seven in the last six games with a double as the Scots came back from a goal down to beat Kazakhstan 3-1 and clinch third spot in Group I.</p>
      <p>The victory - <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland’s</a> third on the spin - maintains momentum ahead of the Euro play-off at Hampden next month.</p>
      <p>Clarke’s team will be drawn against Bulgaria, Israel, Romania or Hungary in Friday’s draw and if Scotland progress they’ll face either Serbia or Norway in a shootout to make the Finals.</p>
      <p>And the national team boss is bristling with confidence after seeing McGinn, whose goals bookended a Steven Naismith header, become the first Scot since James McFadden in 2007 to score in three successive matches.</p>

      <p>Clarke said: “With this group of players, I can be very optimistic about the play-offs. I know they are thinking that. They are 100 percent committed to their country and are desperate to get to a major finals at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020.</a></p>
      <p>“So we can be very optimistic.</p>
      <p>“John is on a fantastic run of form. He has been great for Aston Villa for the last couple of seasons and he is starting to bring it onto the international stage.</p>
      <p>“It’s very important to remember he is still in the early stages of his international career. The more games you play at this level, the better you become, the more experience you get and the better the team will become.</p>
      <p>“When you’ve got any player in goalscoring form that’s good for any team.</p>
      <p>“John is the man scoring the goals this now and hopefully we’ll get one or two more that can to that as well.</p>
      <p>“We’ve found a good position for John. He’s playing it very well, him and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismith</a> are developing a decent understanding and as well as the goals they give us a good early press and the desire to meet the opposition high up the pitch which helps us as well.”</p>

      <p>Clarke was delighted with the display and admits he can’t wait to see Hampden, which only attracted 19,500 last night, filled to capacity for the play-off semi.</p>
      <p>He added: “I thought the performance was good - good in the first half and really good in the second half against a dangerous opponent.</p>
      <p>“We knew if we made mistakes in possession, Kazakhstan could hurt us on the counter attack which they did when they took the lead.</p>
      <p>“But it was a great reaction from the players, in the second half particularly.</p>
      <p>“We played a lot of good stuff, looked a threat going forward and created a lot of chances. Nine shots on target is good.</p>
      <p>“It’s another win - three wins in a row. I don’t know about anyone else, but the boys in the dressing room are feeling good about themselves.</p>
      <p>“We’ll be at home (in the semi) and I think we’ve shown tonight we can be a good team here at Hampden.</p>

      <p>“That place will be full I’m sure. We’ll get a good atmosphere, get the team like that on the front foot and we can be OK.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been here a few times myself as a supporter when it’s been like that.</p>
      <p>“It’s a long way away though. We can enjoy tonight and the fact it’s three wins in a row.</p>
      <p>“But we know we still have a lot of work to do. We’re not getting carried away thinking we’ve cracked it.</p>
      <p>“I said before Cyprus I could see signs of improvement, little things in training, little things in the games that were getting better and we were improving.</p>
      <p>“I said that until we started getting results I couldn’t start shouting about it but hopefully other people can see there has been a little step forward.”</p>
