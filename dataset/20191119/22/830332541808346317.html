      <p>(CNN) - This stunning, one-of-a-kind UNESCO World Heritage Site is losing its battle with the sea.</p>
      <p>The city built on 118 small islands is facing its worst flooding in half a century. Six-foot-high tide levels have engulfed 85% of its streets and buildings.</p>
      <p>Venice's mayor says the city has suffered "grave damage."</p>
      <p>He's calling on the world to help restore its architectural masterpieces, paintings and monuments -- and to help rebuild flooded homes and businesses.</p>
      <h3>Here's how you can help</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.comune.venezia.it/en/content/exceptional-high-tide-appeal-donations-italy-and-abroad">city set up a fund </a>to help support the rebuilding efforts. It says your donation will go directly to restoring what has been damaged.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/venice-flooding">GoFundMe has been set up by Venezia Autentica to help local businesses recover.</a></p>
      <p>The fund points out that many businesses are on the bottom floor, where floodwaters are most damaging.</p>
      <p>The London-based charity <a href="https://www.veniceinperil.org/donate">Venice in Peril has started a fund </a>to help restore monuments, buildings and works of art.</p>
      <p>The nonprofit has restoration projects ongoing around the city -- and the historic flooding has only made things worse.</p>
