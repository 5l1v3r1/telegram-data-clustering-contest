      <p>A man who battered his fiancee to death when she wanted to leave him because of his cross-dressing has been found guilty of murder.</p>
      <p>Roderick Deakin-White, 38, repeatedly hit Amy Parsons, 35, over the head with a metal bar while she was showering in the flat they shared in Whitechapel, east London.</p>
      <p>She suffered "horrific injuries" to her head, face and brain during the attack on April 25 before he left her bleeding to death on the floor.</p>
      <p>Deakin-White denied murder but was found guilty by a jury on Tuesday. He faces a life sentence when he is sentenced on November 26.</p>
      <p>The court heard Ms Parsons, a personal assistant for a City company, became increasingly dissatisfied with the relationship, telling friends one bone of contention was Deakin-White's cross-dressing.</p>
      <h3>Type of courts</h3>
      <h3>Magistrates' court</h3>
      <p>Most criminal cases are heard in a magistrates' court. The magistrates are usually people who live in the local community, sometimes called justices of the peace. There are usually three magistrates who are supported by a legally trained advisor. Sometimes cases are tried by one magistrate, called a district judge, who is a lawyer.</p>
      <p>Magistrates' courts are not as formal as the Crown Court, the magistrates do not wear wigs and only the ushers (court officials who keep everything running smoothly) wear black gowns.</p>
      <h3>Crown Court</h3>
      <p>Some cases are heard in the Crown Court. There are three situations where a case may be 'tried' at the Crown Court:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Serious crimes</li>
        <li>Cases where the defendant (the person accused of the crime) has asked to have his case tried by a jury</li>
        <li>Magistrates may send a case to the Crown Court if they feel they do not have the power to set a sentence as severe as the crime deserves</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Cases at the Crown Court are tried by a jury. These are 12 people from the general public who listen to the evidence presented during the trial and decide if the defendant is guilty of the crime. The judge decides on matters of law during the trial, such as whether certain evidence is allowed to be presented. The judge also makes sure the trial proceeds in a fair way. At the end of the trial if the defendant is found guilty the judge decides the sentence for the crime (for example how long the defendant must spend in prison).</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"She was unhappy about this and this was something he had often wanted to do when they were intimate," said prosecutor Gareth Patterson QC.</p>
      <p>He told jurors Deakin-White became angry and jealous after Ms Parsons began a relationship with colleague James Saunders a few weeks before the killing.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said Deakin-White launched the attack after she told him she was leaving him.</p>

      <p>Mr Patterson said: "On Thursday April 25 this year, he attacked his partner and fiancee, a woman called Amy Parsons.</p>
      <p>"Unwilling to accept that she was going to leave him, he used a metal bar to hit her repeatedly around the head while she was showering in the Docklands flat which they shared.</p>
      <p>"By his blows with the bar he caused her horrific injuries and fractures to the head and face and brain."</p>
      <p>She was left bleeding on the shower floor, and Deakin-White fled the flat before confessing to a friend, who persuaded him to hand himself in.</p>
      <p>Emergency services broke into Ms Parsons' flat and found her naked body covered in blood slumped on the shower floor.</p>

      <p>A post-mortem examination found she suffered major fractures to her head and face and died of a traumatic brain injury.</p>
      <p>In interviews with police, Deakin-White admitted attacking her with a metal bar but denied murder, claiming it was an "accident".</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard Detective Inspector Darren Jones said: "Amy Parsons paid the ultimate price because of Deakin-White's controlling, selfish and violent nature.</p>
      <p>"He relied on Amy's financial support and I believe he could not stand the fact that she was moving on and refused to be taken advantage of any more.</p>
      <p>"Amy had become aware of what kind of person he was and was beginning to take steps to leave Deakin-White.</p>
      <p>"These steps included a new relationship, free from Deakin-White's coercive and abusive behaviour.</p>
      <p>"Because of this Deakin-White launched a vicious and brutal attack on Amy, without warning and in her own home, where she should have been safe and secure."</p>
