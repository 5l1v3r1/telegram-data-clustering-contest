      <p>LONDON, Nov 20 — British rock band The Who became the first act to receive a paving stone on the Music Walk of Fame in London yesterday, in the unveiling of a new cultural attraction that echoes the starry sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
      <p>Following the presentation of the Walk’s founding stone, The Who’s two surviving members Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend posed by their own plaque, depicting a music record, laid out in London’s buzzing Camden district.</p>
      <p>The Music Walk of Fame will honour artists and others working in the industry in a series of unveilings between the Roundhouse and the Koko performance venues in the north London district that is popular with musicians.</p>
      <p>“Camden has always been vital to London’s thriving music scene and is, as we all know, a world-renowned hub for the arts,” The Who said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“As Londoners, it’s very surreal to be immortalised in stone on Camden High Street, and it’s quite something to know that people can pop by and see us anytime, albeit virtually.”</p>
      <p>Up to 20 stones will be laid out each year, organisers have said, and inductees, chosen by a panel, will be honoured in several categories: icon, innovator, inspiration, industry, unsung hero and artist of the year.</p>
      <p>A dedicated app will allow visitors to learn more about the history of the music industry. — Reuters</p>
