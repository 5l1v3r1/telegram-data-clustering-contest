      <h1>Dele Alli first Tottenham player to break silence on Mauricio Pochettino sacking</h1>
      <h2>Dele Alli was quick to praise the departing man who handed him his debut as a teenager at Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:24:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p>Dele Alli has paid tribute to Mauricio Pochettino following Tottenham’s surprise decision to wield the axe on the Argentine boss.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was given the boot after a poor start to the season that leaves them down in 14th in the Premier League table, 11 points behind fourth-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been installed as the bookmakers’ early favourite to replace him at the helm.</p>
      <p>However, Alli was quick to praise the departing man who handed him his debut as a teenager after Daniel Levy decided to show him the door.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “I can’t thank this man enough. He’s taught me so much and I’m so grateful for everything he’s done for me.</p>

      <p>“Good luck and hope to see you again my friend.”</p>
      <p>Alli was reacting after Levy announced in a statement issued by the club: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.</p>

      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history.</p>
      <p>"I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
      <p>“I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
