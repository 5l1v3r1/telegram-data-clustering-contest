      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/what-happened-between-im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-cheryl-and-the-rest-of-girls-aloud-11171350/"> has revealed why she’s not friends with her former Girls Aloud</a> bandmates anymore.</p>
      <p>On tonight’s I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here, the singer admitted to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> that being in the band ‘was fun’ but ‘lots of hard work’.</p>
      <p>Kate asked Nadine why she wasn’t friends with the other members of Girls Aloud or saw them.</p>
      <p>Nadine responded: ‘Everyone gets on with their lives, I was friends with them all, it was all nice and lovely.</p>
      <p>‘But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys, I’d be out partying, me and ten guys, I was having a laugh, I was 18-19 years old.’</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud – made up of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cheryl-fernandez-versini/">Cheryl</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sarah-harding/">Sarah Harding</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nicola-roberts/">Nicola Roberts</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kimberly-walsh/">Kimberly Walsh</a> – were created through the ITV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002.</p>

      <p>On an episode of Celebrity Juice, she told Keith Lemon that she doesn’t see the girls any more.</p>
      <p>She suggested ‘there was no fallout’ but ‘there was just no friendship to begin with.’</p>
      <p>She hinted at a possible cause for the problems to The Sun back in 2017: ‘It was fine at the start but there’s always politics in any band.</p>
      <p>‘It just happened that I always got more vocals than everybody else, so in terms of people wanting their voice heard, that wasn’t happening. And it made people very bitter. They didn’t like that.’</p>
