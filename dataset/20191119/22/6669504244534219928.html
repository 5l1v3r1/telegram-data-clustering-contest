      <p>LONDON - A book that seeks to restore the humanity of the women murdered by Jack the Ripper has won Britain’s leading nonfiction literary award.</p>
      <p>Historian Hallie Rubenhold was awarded the 50,000-pound ($65,000) Baillie Gifford Prize on Tuesday for “The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper.”</p>
      <p>Rubenhold shifts the focus from the killer who terrorized London’s East End in 1888 — the subject of hundreds of books — to his victims. Rubehnhold said they were “ordinary people, like you and I, who happened to fall upon hard times.”</p>
      <p>Stig Abell, who chaired the judging panel, said the book “spoke with an urgency and passion to our own times.”</p>
      <p>The award recognizes English-language books in current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography, autobiography and the arts.</p>
