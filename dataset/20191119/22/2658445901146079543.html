      <p><b>Sir: </b>From a recent study carried out at the Civil Empowerment &amp; Rule of Law Support Initiative, CERLSI, it found out that there are about 160 social media cites in operation today. The trendiest are Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter.</p>
      <p>Even though the others perform relatively the same role as Facebook and twitter, they are not as popular because some are language and region specific. In non-English speaking countries like Russia, China, Belgium, Norway and Germany and France, some social media sites focus on using the medium to promote aspects of the language and culture and traditions of their peoples.</p>
      <p>Some region specific social media sites often have an English translation, and they try to entice you into signing up with them by generally doing everything that the more popular ones like Facebook and twitter do: some are for business, networking and academic incentives.</p>
      <p>The others, also in English, are different from Facebook and twitter and Instagram, in that they cater to the needs of a professional group, like LinkedIn. Others are date sites, race-specific sites and age specific sites.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking, these sites perform one of the most significant roles of the digital age – they provide an opportunity to connect to the commonality of humanity in a way that convention or orthodoxy does not allow.</p>
      <p>Because of this, repressive and intolerant governments are often afraid of this ‘soft power’, and do everything to shut it down, ‘regulate’ or ‘sanitize’ it.</p>
      <p>In the present circumstance in Nigeria, powerful people who often maintain their hold on power by keeping people in the dark suddenly feel threatened at the vista which social media give Nigerians to abuse their representatives not delivering on their election promises.</p>
      <p>We are not sure how the Honourable Minister for Information and Culture Mr Lai Mohammed would set about ‘sanitizing’ and ‘regulating’ over 100 social media sites if Nigerians eventually take to some of them.</p>
      <p>As response to the position being canvassed by Nigerians on Mr Lai Mohammed’s proposed social media law, there have been uncoordinated tunes in and out of government.</p>
      <p>While there are news reports indicating that government is not going to go ahead with the social media law because aspects of what the proposed social media law seeks to achieve were already being taken care of with the law on cybercrime, others, ascribed to the vice president indicate that the proposed media law is really unnecessary. Coming the way it is, there is an air of bewilderment that only an outright abdication of the plan to ‘sanitize’ social media.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But no – there’s a defiant Lai Mohammed insisting that the law on social media ‘regulation’ and ‘sanitization’ must pass. Hear him: <i>Finally, and for the avoidance of doubt, while we welcome robust debate on this issue, the criticisms in certain quarters will not stop us from going ahead with our efforts to sanitize the social media space. It is the right thing to do in the circumstances.”</i></p>
      <p>Nigerians do not want this ‘regulation’, nor are they interested in the ‘sanitization’. What Nigerians want is for government to attend to the circumstances at home and abroad that promote hate speech, fake news and irresponsible journalism. Would Nigerians be peddling ‘hate speech’ if they have food on their tables and jobs that keep them engaged?</p>
      <p>Would Nigerians be writing ‘fake news’ if there are good roads, potable water and electricity? What would be wrong with developing a social media site of our own, wholly Nigerian, and catering to the development of our culture? What is Mr Lai Mohammed doing to resuscitate our dead and dying libraries nationwide, our dying traditional institutions or sell our image through our cultural potentials abroad? All these are very serious issues that the minister should focus on instead of trying to force a law down our necks.</p>
