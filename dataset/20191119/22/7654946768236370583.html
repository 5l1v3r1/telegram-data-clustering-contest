      <h1>Volker changes testimony based on new information</h1>

      <p>Former US envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker’s testimony Tuesday in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-day-3-of-public-testimony/">House impeachment inquiry</a> differed markedly from his October deposition, as the veteran diplomat said he had learned new details since then.</p>
      <p>“Since I gave my testimony on Oct. 3, a great deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light. I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question,” Volker said in his opening statement.</p>
      <p>“I did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations. No one had ever said that to me — and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians.”</p>
      <p>Volker also said that he now knows that the investigation Trump wanted Ukraine to launch into Burisma — the Ukrainian gas giant that hired Hunter Biden as a board member in 2014 — was intended as an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.</p>
      <p>“In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,” added Volker, who was called as a witness by the committee’s Republicans.</p>
      <p>Volker also said in October that investigations were not discussed during a July 10 White House meeting with EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland and aides to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>But on Tuesday, he said that Sondland did bring up investigations, and that he found it “inappropriate.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/gordon-sondland-now-says-he-told-ukraine-official-aid-was-linked-to-biden-investigations/">Sondland</a> also changed his testimony earlier this month from what he had said during his deposition, claiming he remembered that $391 million in security aid Trump was withholding was linked to the probes he wanted.</p>
      <p>“I now recall speaking individually with [Zelensky aid] Mr. [Andriy] Yermak, where I said resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,” Sondland said in his amended testimony.</p>
