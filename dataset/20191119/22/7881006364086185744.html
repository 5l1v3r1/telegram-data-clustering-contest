      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> The Central government on Tuesday said 765 people have been arrested in Jammu and Kashmir for their involvement in 190 stone-pelting and other law and order violations after the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>“Since August 5, 2019 to November 15, 2019, 765 persons have been arrested in 190 cases registered relating to stone pelting/ law and order,” Union minister of state for home affairs G. Kishan Reddy informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He, however, added there was a decline in the incidents of stonepelting since August 5 — in the last 105 days to be precise.</p>
      <p>The minister said the government has initiated multipronged policies to check the stone pelting menace. “A large number of trouble makers, instigators, mob mobilises have been identified and various preventive measures have been taken against them which incl-ude detention under PSA and preventive arrests.”</p>
      <p>“Investigation has revealed that various separatist organisations and activists, which are part of the Hurriyat, have been behind the incidents of stonepelting in the Kashmir valley. The NIA has chargesheeted 18 persons in terror-funding cases so far,” he said.</p>
