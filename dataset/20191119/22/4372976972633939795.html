      <p>Not long after <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/land+rover/">Land Rover</a> launched the new <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/land+rover/defender/">Defender</a>, the automaker's site <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/17/land-rover-defender-configurator-accessories-pricing/">posted the configurator for the 110</a> model with detailed pricing for trims and accessories. The 110 version goes on sale next spring, starting at $49,000 before destination, $50,925 after. The range of smaller 90 models hits <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealerships</a> in fall of 2020, "priced around $50,000" according to Land Rover. We're curious to find out if Land Rover's sand-bagging about the price with a generous use of the word "around," and MSRP will come at $46,000 or thereabouts. If not, we look forward to finding out what the two-door 90 has going for it to command roughly the same premium as the larger, four-door 110 version. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/">Jeep</a>, for example, puts about $3,700 between MSRPs for the two-door and four-door <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/wrangler/">Wranglers</a>.    </p>
      <p>Our interest is piqued by the Land Rover figures because the Defender 90 First Edition will start at $65,100, a price that's $3,550 below the Defender 110 First Edition. If we applied the same $18,750 spread between standard Defender 110 and 110 First Edition cost to the 90, we're at $46,350 for a standard 90 series. Land Rover didn't provide details on the 90 First Edition, but if it follows the template of the 110, it will bundle extra gear like Configurable <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/gmc/terrain/">Terrain</a> Response 2, premium LED headlights with auto high-beam assist, fog lights, a black contrast roof and larger wheels. </p>
      <p>The engine and trim lineup is likely to mimic the 110 in the United States. For engines, that means a P300 with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 296 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, and a P400 with a 3.0-liter V6 with 395 hp and 406 lb-ft into the engine bay. Trim steps should start at S and run through SE, HSE and top-flight X. </p>
      <p>Most of us will have a year to wait to find out for certain. Anyone eager for scoops beforehand will want tickets to <a href="https://4xfar.com/">Land Rover's 4xFAR</a> concert event in California's Coachella Valley January 18-19, 2020. The automaker calls it "a live music festival combining award-winning musical performances with lifestyle, culinary and adventure experiences," and there'll be Defenders there to take visitors on a prepared off-road course. Ticket prices range from $185 plus fees for general admission to $6,500 for access to a private palapa for those who like to play dirty with big faces.</p>
