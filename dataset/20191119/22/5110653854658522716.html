      <h1>When are the College Football Playoff rankings released? Time, channel for CFP selection show after Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:53:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:53</time> by <a rel="author">Zac Al-Khateeb</a></address>
      <p>The top four teams in the third set of College Football Playoff rankings should look similar to the second.</p>
      <p>LSU, Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia each took care of business in their respective games on Saturday, with the lone one-possession win (a 21-14 victory for Georgia) coming over a top-15 team in Auburn. There's the possibility the ordering is different, but it's more likely the selection committee holds serve and keeps the top four teams the same.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It's what happens outside the top four that will be more interesting to monitor. Alabama, ranked No. 5 in the second set of rankings, could drop further down the poll after the loss of starting quarterback <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/how-long-is-tua-tagovailoa-out-injury-timeline-return-date-latest-updates-alabama-qb/15ixpyagdv4m01wbe5vxhdmk4g">Tua Tagovailoa</a>, despite a 38-7 win over Mississippi State. Losses suffered by previously undefeated Baylor and Minnesota will need to be parsed through as well.</p>
