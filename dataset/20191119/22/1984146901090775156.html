      <p>I'm A Celebrity viewers are labelling Roman Kemp as TV gold thanks to his impressions of hosts Ant &amp; Dec.</p>
      <p>Capital Radio host and son of Spandau Ballet and Eastenders legend Martin Kemp, Roman is one of the famous faces taking part in the new series of the hit ITV show and, as all of the celebs were united for the first time on Tuesday night's show, Roman took centre stage with his impressions of the Geordie duo.</p>
      <p>And, <i><b>as you can see in the video above taken from ITV</b></i>, he's rather good! <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec</a> saw the funny side too, working Roman's impressions into their next link and viewers at home were impressed too.</p>
      <p>One reacted "funniest bit tonight was Ant and Dec's impression of Roman's impression of them! hilarious," and in agreement, another tweeted "actually can't breathe at <a href="https://twitter.com/antanddec">@antanddec</a> doing roman's impression... tears down my face," and a third posted "Roman doing Ant and Dec impressions is so funny Cos it is exactly like them."</p>

      <p>However, other fans of the show think Roman sounded like another famous character - Mrs Doubtfire. One responded to his impressions by tweeting "Roman sounded more like Mrs doubtfire than ant and dec," while another said it made them realise how much Ant &amp; Dec sounded like Robin Williams' famous cross-dressing nanny, writing "Thanks to Roman Kemp I never realised how much <a href="https://twitter.com/antanddec">@antanddec</a> (Dec) sounded like Mrs Doubtfire."</p>
