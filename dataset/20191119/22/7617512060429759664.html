      <h1>Oak Bay girls grab Island volleyball title</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:02:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:02</time> by <a rel="author">Cleve Dheensaw</a></address>
      <p>Oak Bay was the third seed entering the Island Quad-A girls’ high school volleyball championships held at Belmont. But the surprising Bays are headed to the B.C. championships Nov. 27-30 at the Langley Events Centre as the top Island team after upsetting B.C. No. 7 Claremont and B.C. No. 9 Dover Bay.</p>
      <p>Oak Bay beat Claremont in the final. Dover Bay captured the third-and-final berth into the provincial tournament by defeating 2018 B.C. runner-up Belmont in the bronze-medal game.</p>
      <p>The host Carihi Tyees of Campbell River beat the Stelly’s Stingers in the Triple-A girls’ Island final. Provincially fourth-ranked Carihi and Stelly’s both advanced to the B.C. championships next weekend at the LEC. The 2017 B.C.-champion and 2018 runner-up Tyees will attempt to regain the provincial title, which just eluded them last year in a loss to Crofton House in the B.C. final.</p>
      <p>There is no Quad-A class in provincial boys’ high school volleyball. The Claremont Spartans, Oak Bay Barbers and Reynolds Roadrunners are the Island representatives in the B.C. boys’ Triple-A championship. SMUS and Pacific Christian School are headed to the B.C. boys’ Double-A championship.</p>
      <p>All tournaments are at the LEC from Nov. 27-30.</p>
      <p>SOCCER: Brentwood College had a good run through the B.C. high school boys’ Double-A championships at Burnaby Lake but it ended short of the big prize with a 2-0 loss Tuesday to Notre Dame of Vancouver in the semifinals.</p>
      <p>Brentwood will play Langley Fundamental in this morning’s bronze-medal game, while Notre Dame will play for gold against St. Thomas Aquinas.</p>
      <p>The other Island teams in the B.C. tournament included St. Michaels University School, Carhi and Brooks of Powell River.</p>
      <p>The B.C. boys’ Triple-A championship begins Thursday at Burnaby Lake featuring the Island-champion Reynolds Roadrunners and runner-up Oak Bay.</p>
      <p>FOOTBALL: There will be a new B.C. boys’ Triple-A football champion this year. The defending-champion Mount Douglas Rams, who have won five provincial titles in the last eight years, were edged 24-21 by St. Thomas More in the provincial quarter-finals at B.C. Place.</p>
      <p>Vancouver College beat Kelowna 35-7, Lord Tweedsmuir defeated New Westminster 36-7 and Notre Dame got past South Delta 28-15 in the other quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>In the Double-A quarter-finals, Ballenas of Parksville defeated Robert Bateman of Abbotsford 35-18 to advance to a semifinal date Saturday against Vernon at B.C. Place.</p>
