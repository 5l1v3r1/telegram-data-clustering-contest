      <h1>Selena Gomez &amp; Bella Hadid’s Instagram Fight Is Proof Of Mercury Retrograde’s Existence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:37:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:37</time> by <a rel="author">By Matt Galea</a></address>
      <p>With the craziness of Halloween and the countdown to Christmas, I think people forgot a very important little something that’s going down right now by the name of Mercury Retrograde.</p>
      <p>As we know, when Mercury goes Retrograde, communication goes haywire, as does technology, so your social media interactions with people can become misconstrued or misinterpreted, leading to unintended online beef.</p>
      <p><b>Selena Gomez</b> would’ve been wise to remember this when leaving a comment on <b>Bella Hadid’s</b> Instagram ‘coz it resurrected their buried feud. Sigh.</p>

      <p>A coupla days back, Bellzy posted a gorg pic, which prompted Sel to write “Stunning” in the comments.</p>
      <p>Following this, a Selena fan account noted that Bella had deleted the pic, to which Sel reacted “That sucks,” implying that the model only deleted the pic ‘coz she wanted to remove Sel’s comment.</p>

      <p>After Elle Magazine reported on the matter, Selena quashed the beef in the comments section of the article’s Insta post.</p>
      <p>“NO,” Selena wrote. “I shouldn’t of [sic] spoken without knowing the truth. I’m sorry. Please don’t be hurtful. She is a wonderful person and it was all a misunderstanding.”</p>

      <p><i><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/bella-hadid-selena-gomez-instagram-deletion-no-feud/">TMZ </a></i>has also reported that Bella privately reached out to Sel to let her know that she only took the pic down because she decided she didn’t care for the shot.</p>
      <p>TBF, who among us hasn’t posted a selfie then after seeing it on your grid, gone: ‘Ew. Gross. Deleting.’</p>
      <p>This looks like a case of the internet making a bigger deal of something than it is.</p>
      <p>It’s all good in the hood with Sel and Bell.</p>
