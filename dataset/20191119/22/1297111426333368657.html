      <h1>Multiple stolen bicycles recovered — again</h1>
      <h2>A month after the recovery of 44 stolen bikes, police have found 70 more.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:01:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/hpolischuk" target="_blank">Heather Polischuk</a></address>
      <p>For the second time in as many months, Regina police have seized a large cache of stolen bicycles.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Regina Police Service (RPS) issued a news release, stating approximately 70 stolen bicycles and other property had been seized from a Regina residence, resulting in a charge laid against a 57-year-old Regina man.</p>
      <p>In October, a 40-year-old Regina man was charged after 44 bicycles were recovered along with various other items, including firearms.</p>
      <p>The large number of stolen bicycles falls in line with statistics provided by police earlier this year when the RPS and partners announced Project 529, intended to tackle bike theft through the availability of a free online registry (available at <a href="https://project529.com/garage">www.project529.com</a>).</p>
      <p>At that time, police noted Regina’s bike thefts have spiked over the years. Police provided year-over-year stats dating back to 2013 and including January through August of 2019. Back in 2013, 440 bike thefts were reported between January and August, with 588 reported for the entire year. By 2018, those numbers had jumped to 784 and 1,081. The period between January and August 2019 was already showing a marked jump, coming in at 922 reported bicycle thefts.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 16, police were called to assist the Regina Sheriff’s Office at a Richardson Crescent address.</p>
      <p>While there, police and sheriffs located and seized 44 bicycles believed to be stolen, a stolen motorcycle, a replica handgun and a 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun.</p>
      <p>A 40-year-old man was arrested and charged with various offences, including weapons offences and possession of stolen property over $5,000. He is still before the court.</p>

      <p>In the newest case, police received information on Nov. 19 through Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods about a residence on the 800 block of College Avenue that appeared to contain numerous bicycles. Suspecting the bikes might be stolen, police headed to the residence and arrested a 57-year-old suspect.</p>
      <p>Further investigation by the RPS street crimes section led to the recovery of approximately 70 stolen bicycles as well as numerous expensive tools, including a paint sprayer, pressure washers, power saws, a cement mixer and a planer.</p>
      <p>The suspect was subsequently charged with possession of stolen property over $5,000 and is due in court on Jan. 7.</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>
      <p>The RPS said it will take time to properly record the seized items and contact the bikes’ owners.</p>
      <p>“If you believe your bike may be among these recovered bicycles, please ensure that you have made an original report to Regina Police Service, reporting your bike stolen,” the news release stated. “If you did not report it stolen, you can still do so; please give a serial number (if you have it) and any other unique, identifying characteristics. Then, please be patient: it will take at least two weeks for our investigators and Evidence Management staff to process the recovered bikes.”</p>
      <p>Police said once the bikes are logged into their computer system, they will begin to contact the owners.</p>
