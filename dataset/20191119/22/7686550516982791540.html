      <h1>The magnificent Wales player ratings as one star achieves perfection on night of sheer Euro joy</h1>
      <h2>Here's how we rated Ryan Giggs' aces against Hungary... including one player who gets ten out of ten</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:14:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:14</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Abbandonato</a></address>
      <p>Wales have marched to Euro 2020 after an epic 2-0 Cardiff City Stadium triumph over Hungary.</p>
      <p>This how we rated Ryan Giggs' magnificent Wales stars on a magnificent night as they coped superbly with the pressure upon them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WAYNE HENNESSEY 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pulled off two outstanding stops in first half to keep Wales ahead. Looked calm, composed, assured. A rock at the back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CONNOR ROBERTS 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Has transformed the right-back position since displacing Chris Gunter. Swashbuckling as always, prepared to charge forward on the overlap, defensively sound.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOM LOCKYER 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chosen ahead of Ashley Williams, he once again fully justified his manager's call. Hardly troubled by Hungary's big centre forward Adam Szalai, who had caused so much damage to the Welsh defence in Budapest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CHRIS MEPHAM 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>To think he's still only 22. Majestic in the air, good on the ball, his reputation just went up another notch. He'll be a big player in the finals.</p>

      <p>
        <b>BEN DAVIES 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brilliant, defensively and charging forward on the overlap. He and Roberts offer a much greater offensive threat under Giggs than Gunter and Taylor did even in the Chris Coleman era. Possibly his finest Wales performance since those last Euros.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JOE MORRELL 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chosen ahead of Ethan Ampadu, he once again belied the fact that he plays for Lincoln City with a towering international performance. What a couple of matches he has just had.</p>
      <p>
        <b>JOE ALLEN 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like Davies, his best Wales game since Euro 2016. Tigerish in the tackle, excellent on the ball, he covered every blade of grass on the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>AARON RAMSEY 10</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wow. What can you say? Scored two goals, ran the show from midfield, made the passes, put in the tackles, covered the hard yards. Utterly imperious, the kind of proper playmaker previous Wales teams have lacked. His game already appears to have gone to another level as a result of joining Juventus. Close to perfection on a perfect night.</p>

      <p>
        <b>GARETH BALE 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Came off near the end to one of the loudest standing ovations known at Cardiff City Stadium. Threatened going forward as always, worked back in defence, the captain led by example. As he will during the Euro finals next summer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DAN JAMES 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Never stopped running, or working, and a constant menace to Hungary's heavily overstretched back line. He's another who will light up the Euros with his blistering pace, shooting and goal threat.</p>
      <p>
        <b>KIEFFER MOORE 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Held the ball up, won the headers, gained the free kicks, got Wales up the pitch, set up Ramsey's second. The Wigan man has brought so much to the team since being introduced out of the blue a few months back.</p>
      <p><b>SUBS:</b> Ethan Ampadu (for Morrell 49), Harry Wilson (for Bale 87)</p>
