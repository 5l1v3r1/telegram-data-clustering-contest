      <p>Blockchain technology has been given a somewhat unusual demonstration in <a href="http://www.newsbtc.com/tags/new-york">New York</a> City this week. Organisers of a traditional Chinese calligraphy exhibition have used the data sharing innovation to prove the authenticity of works on display.</p>
      <p>The exhibit also uses <a href="http://www.newsbtc.com/tags/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a> technology. Viewers can experience the process by which artists create their pieces, learning more about the art form as a result.</p>
      <h3>Blockchain Utility Showcased at New York Calligraphy Exhibit</h3>
      <p>According to a <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2019-11/19/content_75422960.htm">report</a> in Chinese news publication <i>China.org.cn</i>, the exhibition opened yesterday at the Harvard Club in New York City. It features the work of one of the nation’s most respected calligraphy artists, Tao Fo.</p>
      <p>Data relating to each of Fo’s pieces has been uploaded to a blockchain system. This allows for visitors to check the authenticity, as well as other information about the artwork.</p>

      <p>Powering the blockchain system used is UBI Blockchain Internet Ltd. Established in 2016, the company is based in <a href="http://www.newsbtc.com/tags/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>. It has been developing different blockchain applications and exploring the technology’s implications for safety, quality controls, and authentication in a range of industries. These include food, pharmaceuticals, finance, energy, and art.</p>
      <p>The two-day exhibition is the work of Harvard Wealth Strategy and Management LLC, ZiJinWanXiang (Beijing) International Cultural Media Center, and UBI Blockchain. UBI Blockchain founder Tony Liu said at yesterday’s opening ceremony that the system provides a unique, censorship resistant electronic identity for each piece in the collection.</p>
      <p>Visitors to the exhibition can scan a QR code associated with each piece on their smartphone. Doing so will display information about the artwork, including its ownership and authenticity.</p>
      <p>As well as blockchain technology, those behind the calligraphy exhibit are keen to demonstrate the possibilities of virtual reality in a similar setting. The exhibit application allows visitors to view VR demonstrations of each of the artworks’ creations, as well as more information about the traditional Chinese art form.</p>
      <p>Blockchain technology is fast seeing adoption around the world. Although its first major success was in the financial sector, with cryptocurrency, distributed ledgers are now being used in a range of industries to provide assurances as to the legitimacy of a product. <i>NewsBTC </i>has reported on many previous occasions of systems introduced by a plethora of different companies to help promote supply chain transparency and provide greater assurances of the legitimacy of an individual’s or company’s claims. The latest examples of such are the vast logistics management system introduced by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/walmart-canada-launches-largest-blockchain-for-supply-chain-management-ever/">Walmart Canada</a> and the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/us-veterinary-education-industry-the-latest-adopting-blockchain-tech/">US veterinary industry’s</a> efforts to create a system for blockchain-based qualification and credential checking.</p>
