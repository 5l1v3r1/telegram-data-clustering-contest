      <p><b>RICHLAND PARISH, La. (KNOE) </b>Birthdays only come once a year. Some people spend their special day shopping, going out to eat or taking a trip, but one woman chose to celebrate at the hospital.</p>
      <p>"That's what I wanted for my birthday that's exactly what I wanted was to be here with the people that I feel made me feel whole again," said Rhonda Jones.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old Jackson, Mississippi, woman said at one point she didn’t think she would live to see this birthday and that’s why she chose to celebrate with the staff at Richland Parish Hospital in Delhi.</p>
      <p>Jones said she starting feeling bad last June after a gastric sleeve weight loss surgery.</p>
      <p>"My body just kind of went haywire," Jones said.</p>
      <p>After a year she went from weighing 297 pounds to 110, an issue that she said even left the doctors stumped. With the weight loss also came other troubling signs.</p>
      <p>"I got ready to stand up and noticed I couldn't walk the same," Jones said.</p>
      <p>Jones said she was in and out of the hospital dozens of times, and eventually, she had to find a rehabilitation center. Then, insurance became an issue.</p>
      <p>"It didn't have a certified place that was covered that they would pay in the place that we were in a 60-mile radius," said Terrance Jones, Rhonda’s husband.</p>
      <p>Faced with a list of unfamiliar places, the Jones’ had a choice to make. She credits her sorority sister for recommending the Richland Parish Hospital in Delhi.</p>
      <p>By the time she got to Delhi, her health had suffered completely.</p>
      <p>"She had lots of neurological problems going on she couldn't feed herself, she could not walk, she couldn't write her name...she could hardly speak," said Marcia Payne a Richland Parish Hospital nurse.</p>
      <p>After two months of intense physical therapy and a push from family and nurses, Rhonda made a 180 turn for the better.</p>
      <p>"She's a miracle and I know that we had a hand in it but God had a hand in this too," Payne said.</p>
      <p>Jones slowly but surely learned how to walk, talk and even raise her hand again.</p>
      <p>While the road to recovery is just beginning, she said she’s motivated to keep going.</p>
      <p>"I'm coming back, I will be back, yes I will definitely be back with a vengeance because I'm blessed beyond measure," Jones said.</p>
