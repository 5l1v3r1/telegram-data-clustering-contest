      <h1>Hunt for brutal dog-killer: Ezra’s family shocked and confused</h1>

      <p>The family of a dog stabbed to death in their front yard say they are clueless as to the motivation behind the “sickening” attack.</p>
      <p>The alleged killer turned up to their Glen Creek property, north-east of Myrtleford, in a dark blue Subaru Forester about 6pm on Monday last week.</p>
      <p>He stepped out of the passenger side of the car at the Tunnel Gap Road home, approached Ezra the kelpie, and stabbed him to death.</p>
      <p>Ezra’s young owner found her pet bleeding profusely from four stab wounds.</p>
      <p>More than a week on, the alleged dog-killer remains on the run.</p>
      <p>“It’s bad enough for any kid that loses a pet, but to have it taken from her in that manner, it’s pretty sickening and pretty disgusting really,” the father of Ezra’s owner, Darryl Symons, told 3AW.</p>
      <p>“If they were trying to prove a point, I’ve got no idea what the point was.</p>
      <p>“All it proved is they know how to kill a dog in a ruthless and gutless fashion.”</p>
      <p>Police are seeking public assistance to track down the distinctive vehicle, which had black mag wheels, black roof racks and a loud sports exhaust.</p>
      <p>The man is described as tall with a thin build and was wearing a black hoodie and black tracksuits pants at the time.</p>
