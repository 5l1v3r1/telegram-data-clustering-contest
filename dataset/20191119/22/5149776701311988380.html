      <p>Liam Bridcutt helped Bolton Wanderers to get their League One points tally into positive numbers at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> midfielder is on loan with Bolton until January, and he returned from three matches out injured to feature in Saturday's 1-0 victory over MK Dons, which moved Keith Hill's side on to one point.</p>
      <p>They began the 2019-20 campaign with a 12-point deduction for going into administration.</p>
      <p>Since joining the Trotters on September 2, Bridcutt has made six appearances, including draws against Oxford United, Sunderland and Blackpool.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether Sabri Lamouchi chooses to bring the 30-year-old back to the City Ground in the new year to add to his extensive midfield options - or whether the deal could be extended.</p>
      <p>Bridcutt has scored one goal in 31 appearances for Forest since signing in the summer of 2017.</p>
      <p>Only one of his 28 Championship appearances came last season.</p>
      <p>We took to our Nottingham Forest News Facebook page to ask Reds supporters: "would you bring him back in January?"</p>

      <p>Some were keen for the ex-Leeds United man to get another chance to impress Lamouchi, although others feel more game time could come away from Trentside.</p>

        <i>Here's a selection of the responses...</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Paolo Molinari:</b> In case of need, why not? He did good when involved...</p>
      <p><b>Christopher Hibbert:</b> Some people don’t like him but he’s looked solid whenever I’ve seen him. Good link between defence and midfield</p>
      <p><b>Andrew Chard:</b> Nope... Ask Bolton or anyone else if they want to buy him</p>
      <p><b>Sean Dethick:</b> I've always rated him so why not??</p>
      <p><b>Matthew Coombes:</b> That’s his standard</p>
      <p><b>Wayne Hewes:</b> Defo never given a chance cracking player</p>
      <p><b>Kelvin Titch Roddis:</b> Yes he’s never been given a chance for Forest since his arrival.</p>
      <p><b>Steve Price:</b> NO! A waste of £500K never looked the player that everyone raved about, probably found his level in the 3rd tier!</p>
      <p><b>Shane Farren:</b> Always rated the guy but seems to fall under the radar with managers since he's been here!!</p>
      <p><b>Simon Allin:</b> Nah, let him go, he deserves to play at his stage of career and won’t get a game with us</p>
      <p><b>Steve Parkes:</b> Do you know how many midfielders we have??</p>
      <p><b>Tom Juliet Barrett:</b> Yes definitely, he's never been given a real chance here.</p>
