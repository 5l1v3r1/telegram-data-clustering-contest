      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:52:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/prakash-kumar" target="_blank">Prakash Kumar</a></address>
      <p>The Centre of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu has been shifted from the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysuru, to Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, the government told the Lok Sabha.</p>
      <p>“The centre of excellence for studies in classical Telugu has been shifted to Andhra Pradesh in view of it being a Telugu-speaking state.</p>
      <p>Allocation of budget for it (institution) has also been made,” Human Resources Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank told the House, while replying to a question.</p>
      <p>The centre of excellence had been set up in Mysuru, after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014.</p>
      <p>The HRD minister told the Lok Sabha that the Union government was committed to support and strengthen the Telugu language.</p>
      <p>To a question on the steps taken by his ministry to promote studies in Telugu language, the minister said the University Grants Commission (UGC) has approved a centre for classical languages in Telugu in the University of Hyderabad and allocated Rs 1.5 crore to it.</p>
      <p>“Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University, University of Delhi, University of Hyderabad and the Central University of Andhra Pradesh are offering Telugu language courses,” he added.</p>
