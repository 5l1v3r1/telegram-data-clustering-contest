      <p>Anthony Joshua has explained his new “killer” mindset for the Andy Ruiz Jr rematch on December 7 in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>In a video posted to his YouTube channel, AJ gave fans an insight into his Sheffield training camp as he prepares for a potentially career defining bout.</p>
      <p>Discussing his mental state, Joshua said: “Mindset’s calm, mindset’s cool. Killer mindset, that’s what it’s about.</p>
      <p>“Ice cold, stay in the moment, stay disciplined, just killer.</p>
      <p>“I belong here, I deserve to be here. This ain’t new to me.</p>
      <p>“Everything we do is only for greatness. That’s just how I wanna approach my training camps moving forwards.</p>
      <p>“Boxing’s a sticky and a tricky game mentally. Physically is one thing, but there’s highs and lows with this.</p>
      <p>“Do I wanna do it? Am I good enough? Am I getting the opportunities that I deserve?</p>
      <p>“So many obstacles, but you’ve just tell yourself that you belong here and you belong at the top level.</p>
      <p>“When you keep on telling yourself that, you’ll soon find yourself in positions that are only for the greats.”</p>
