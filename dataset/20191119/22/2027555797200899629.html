      <h1>Roshan Baig meets CM, discusses Dec 5 bypolls</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:46:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/bharath-joshi" target="_blank">Bharath Joshi</a></address>
      <p>Disqualified Shivajinagar legislator R Roshan Baig reportedly held talks with Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Tuesday to discuss strategy for the upcoming bypolls. </p>
      <p>Baig's meeting with the chief minister came a day after he decided not to contest the Shivajinagar bypoll. </p>
      <p>The two leaders held talks for about 15 minutes at Yediyurappa's Dollar's Colony residence. </p>
      <p>Talks were also held on whether Baig would campaign for the BJP candidate, former councillor M Sharavana, or limit his role by extending external support, a source said.</p>
      <p>Congress has fielded Baig's bete noire Rizwan Arshad from the constituency, which has found opposition from a section of Congress corporators who back Baig.</p>
      <p>Soon after BJP denied him a ticket, there were rumours that Baig would contest as an independent. However, it was soon to put to rest as he did not file his nomination papers on Monday, the last day for filing nominations.</p>
