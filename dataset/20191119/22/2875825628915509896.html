      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/paris-hilton">Paris Hilton</a> has denied ever having plastic surgery and says there's another secret to her youthful glow.</p>
      <p>The hotel heiress, 38, is just a couple of years away from her 40th birthday, but shared the secret to looking like she's still in her 20s.</p>
      <p>Paris, who is close friends with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> , stays saying out of the sun is the key to maintaining a youthful glow.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7702141/Paris-Hilton-EXCLUSIVE-star-reveals-looks-young.html">MailOnline</a> : "My mother always taught me to stay out of the sun and about how important skincare is."</p>
      <p>Speaking at the 3rd Annual #REVOLVEawards at Goya Studios in Hollywood, she said that while she's hitting the beach in places like Ibiza and St Barts, she's always armed with plenty of sunscreen and a big hat to block out the rays.</p>

      <p>She also took the opportunity to plug her own beauty product line, Paris Hilton ProD.N.A Skincare, which she says gives "incredible results".</p>
      <p>But when it comes to going under the knife to alter your appearance, she says it's something she's never done.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm all natural and very proud of that."</p>
      <p>She previously said in 2018: "I've never done any Botox, filler â€” no plastic surgery in my life."</p>

      <p>Recently, Kim talked about her friendship with Paris in her True Hollywood Story.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-four Kim, 38, credited Paris for teaching her how to handle the celeb life.</p>
      <p>Learning from the best, Kim had lessons in stepping out of cars from her old pal.</p>
      <p>Kim and the hotel heiress have been friends since childhood, but of course, things between them have been strained at times.</p>

      <p>However, Paris did impart this special knowledge onto Kim, who said: "I remember we were sitting in her SLR Mercedes... and at that point, the paparazzi would lay on the ground to try and get a picture of you, up your dress, and she said, 'OK. We need to make sure you don't give them that'.</p>
      <p>"She was such a great mentor for me. I really am grateful for my experiences with her. She's a huge, huge reason for my success."</p>
