      <p>Crazed Indiana officer Daryl Jones was fired after bullying two black men for "acting suspicious" after they bought a bunch of goods from Nordstrom Rack.</p>
      <p>The unhinged officer came up to the men, who were sitting in their car in front of the department store, and asked for their ID. When the Nordstrom customers repeatedly asked why, the officer's only response was that they were acting suspicious. When they asked for the officer's name, he wouldn't give it to them. When they questioned his behavior, he said, "I got my rights to do anything I want to do, I’m a police officer."</p>
      <p>Finally the now ex-officer called for backup, who realized what a jerk the officer was and let the guys go. Good thing the guys videotaped the incident (things get going at 1:15). Two hours after the chief constable watched it, Jones was fired. A refreshing ending to a common horror story.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/indiana-officer-fired-after-stopping-black-men-nordstrom-rack-acting-n1085661">NBC</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>In the video posted to YouTube on Nov. 13, the description says the two men first noticed the officer watching them while they were at a Nordstrom Rack store in the Castleton neighborhood of Indianapolis...<br/><br/>According to the description of the 17-minute video posted a day after the incident, which has been viewed more than 300,000 times as of Tuesday morning, the men started filming when they began to exit the parking lot and the officer screamed he was going to run their plates. <br/><br/>"He watched us buy everything, and then followed us to the car," the YouTube video description says...The men repeatedly ask the officer, identified as Lawrence Township Deputy Constable Daryl Jones by NBC affiliate WTHR in Indianapolis, why he approached them in the parking lot and why he wanted to see their driver's licenses. They also request multiple times that he call his supervisor.<br/><br/>Jones was off duty and working security for the Nordstrom Rack store. The store told NBC News on Tuesday that he no longer works there.<br/><br/>Lawrence Township Chief Constable Terry Burns told NBC News on Tuesday he fired the constable in the video within two hours of viewing it. He also said Jones had been in the role for about 20 years. Jones could not immediately be reached for comment.</blockquote>
