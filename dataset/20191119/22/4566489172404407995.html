      <p>Lambert encouraged his fans on social media to help support the fight against AIDS with Mercury Phoenix Trust by doing their best impression of the late but great Freddie Mercury, the frontman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band Queen.</p>
      <p>The Mercury Phoenix Trust (MPT) was set up by Brian May, Roger Taylor, and Jim Beach in memory of the legendary Freddie Mercury who passed away from HIV/AIDS in 1991 at the age of 45; moreover, The MPT is an integral part of the rock band Queen and Freddie Mercury's legacy, with the passion and power behind the music forming the bedrock of the MPT.</p>

      <p>This past September, Lambert performed with Brian May and Roger Taylor of <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/adam-lambert-and-queen-urge-world-leaders-to-prioritize-oceans/article/557743">Queen</a> at the 2019 Global Citizen Festival in Central Park, New York.
