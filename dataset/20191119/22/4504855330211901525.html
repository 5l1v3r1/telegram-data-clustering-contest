      <p>(CNN) — Kraft Heinz Food Company has<a href="https://news.kraftheinzcompany.com/press-release/brand/select-varieties-breakstones-cottage-cheese-are-voluntarily-being-recalled-due-p"> issued a voluntary recall</a> of three varieties of their Breakstone’s Cottage Cheese products due to potential contamination of metal and plastic pieces.</p>
      <p>The company announced Friday that approximately 9,500 cases of its cottage cheese are being recalled due to contamination concerns which it says have been introduced during production.</p>
      <p>The recall comes after a customer notified the company that they had found a piece of red plastic in a container of cottage cheese.</p>
      <p>So far, Kraft Heinz reports there have been six consumer complains of contamination, but no reports of injury or illness related to the issue.</p>
      <p>“Consumption of hard or sharp foreign material could cause injury to teeth, mouth, throat, stomach or intestine tissues if swallowed,” the company warns.</p>
      <p>Three of the company’s cottage cheese products are included in the recall — Breakstone’s 2% Milkfat Lowfat Large Curd Cottage Cheese, as well as their small and large curd 4% Milkfat Cottage Cheese.</p>
      <p>All three of the recalled batches are marked with a use-by date of December 10, 2019.</p>
      <p>The products were distributed across the US and exported to Latin America.</p>
      <p>Those who have purchased any of the recalled products should not consume it and return it to the store where it was purchased to receive a refund or exchange, the company advises.</p>
