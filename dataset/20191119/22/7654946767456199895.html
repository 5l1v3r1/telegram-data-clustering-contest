      <h1>The best wine for Thanksgiving dinner, according to a top NYC sommelier</h1>

      <p>Whether you’re fighting traffic or wrestling a bird into a roasting pan, Thanksgiving is hard work. But at least you can farm the wine pairing out to Aldo Sohm.</p>
      <p>“On Thanksgiving, I typically don’t like to pull super-complicated wines,” Sohm, who oversees the wine at Le Bernardin and Aldo Sohm Wine Bar in Midtown, tells The Post. For a group gathering like this one, you want a crowd-pleaser. “Don’t be selfish and pick a Gewürztraminer that only you might like, leaving other people with long faces.”</p>
      <p>In his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wine-Simple-Approachable-World-Class-Sommelier/dp/1984824252?tag=nypost-20">“Wine Simple”</a> (Clarkson Potter), the sommelier explains that every dish has a wine that perfectly complements it. In his opinion, turkey’s best bud is pinot noir.</p>
      <p>“Turkey is a more delicate meat,” he says. He thinks its fatty, salty-sweetness is nicely rounded out by the sweet, red-berry fruit flavors in a pinot. He also likes that “pinot noir is a little bit lighter, a little bit fresher” than other reds. Since you’ll be sipping it over the course of a long meal — and maybe before and after, too — “you want to choose something you can drink all day and not get tired of it.”</p>
      <p>He even has a favorite bottle for the occasion — Bodega Chacra’s Barda pinot noir ($24 at <a href="https://www.astorwines.com/">Astor Wines &amp; Spirits</a>). If you can’t find it, look for another pinot from the Sonoma Coast; a gamay or a light zinfandel would also work.</p>
      <p>All of that, of course, is assuming ideal circumstances — you’ve planned ahead and stopped by a solid wine shop with time to spare. But if it’s 2 p.m. on Thursday the 28th, and your options are limited to whatever’s open between your apartment and your host’s, there’s still hope, says Sohm. Look for a bottle of Grüner Veltliner, a dry, ubiquitous Austrian white that Sohm describes as “incredibly reliable” at any price point.</p>
      <p>“Ninety-five percent of the time, you can buy a $15 Grüner and it’ll taste good,” writes Sohm in “Wine Simple.” As a native Austrian, he is admittedly biased to the varietal — but with good cause. “It’s one of the best food-pairing wines, typically everyone likes it, and you don’t have to spend [much] to get a good one.”</p>
      <p>Once you’ve got your bottle, keep it cold — no matter the color.</p>
      <p>“People always say that red wine should be at room temperature . . . [but] I like my reds slightly cool. I find it restrains the alcohol, putting it more into the background, and allows the fruit to become more layered,” Sohm writes.</p>
      <p>He’s a bit of an overachiever when it comes to maintaining wine temperature on the go: Sohm refrigerates bottles for 20 minutes, wraps them in ice-pack-like wine sleeves and transports them in an insulated bag. In lieu of sommelier-level transport methods, your host’s fridge will do. Sohm recommends storing reds in the fridge for 10 minutes to an hour. White wines, rosés and anything sparkly should be even colder — so he sticks those in the freezer for 30 minutes (45 for Champagne, because the bottles tend to be thicker). And set a  timer so you don’t forget. “Otherwise, it’s cleanup time,” writes Sohm.</p>
