      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:30:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/reid-nakamura/" target="_blank">Reid Nakamura</a></address>
      <p>Kevin Hart is the subject of an upcoming Netflix documentary series “Don’t F–k This Up,” the comedian announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Per Netflix, the six-part series “gives unprecedented access” into Hart’s life throughout the past year. “Tapping into the trials and tribulations of what it means to be a father, a partner, a role-model, and a business-man, Hart reflects on the events that have shaped his life, making him into the person he is today.”</p>
      <p>Featuring interviews with Hart’s friends and family as well as archival footage from his early career, the documentary will cover Hart’s day-to-day life in the period following the fallout of his Oscars hosting controversy.</p>

      <p>Hart was forced to step down from his position as host of the awards show late last year when anti-gay tweets and jokes from his past stand-up sets were resurfaced on social media. It was followed by a much-lambasted appearance on Ellen DeGeneres’ talk show in which the comedian refused to apologize again.</p>
      <p>“Don’t F–k This Up” is produced by Hartbeat Productions, Lionsgate, Makemake, 3 Arts Entertainment, and Magical Elves.</p>
