      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity's</a> Nadine Coyle addressed the Girls Aloud rift rumours during tonight's episode of the show.</p>
      <p>The former girl band member stirred up trouble outside the jungle camp long before getting to Australia as to the reasons why <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/girls-aloud">Girls Aloud</a> split up.</p>
      <p>The pop group, formed on the show Pop Stars: The Rivals in 2002, split for good after a reunion tour in 2013.</p>
      <p>But, speaking to campmate Kate Garraway, she said: "I was friends with them all."</p>
      <p>During the show, Kate and Nadine talked about girl bands and Nadine commented that being in one is lots of fun but lots of hard work.</p>
      <p>Kate asked Nadine why she wasn’t friends with the other members of Girls Aloud or saw them.</p>

      <p>Nadine replied: “Everyone gets on with their lives.</p>
      <p>"I was friends with them all - it was all nice and lovely.</p>
      <p>"But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys.</p>
      <p>"I’d be out partying - me and ten guys.</p>
      <p>"I was having a laugh. I was 18 to 19 years old.”</p>

      <p>The conversation comes after various reports have arisen about the girl band's demise following Nadine's appearance in the jungle.</p>
      <p>According to Nadine, bandmates Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh, Nicola Roberts and Sarah Harding made the decision behind her back and only informed her via their management moments before the final performance of their Ten: The Hits Tour.</p>
      <p>"I felt numb. I was in shock. I definitely hadn’t seen that coming," she added at the time.</p>
      <p>"It still shocks me. I wouldn’t do that to a, quote, friend of mine. I wouldn’t have operated in that way if it had been in my control, but it wasn’t."</p>

      <p>But in an interview with Attitude magazine Cheryl hit back at her former bandmate.</p>
      <p>"She's full of sh**. What d'you want us to say? She's full of s***. She was the one who wanted to make a solo record. Which is why we took the hiatus," she told Attitude magazine, referencing the three-year break they took from 2009.</p>
      <p>"She wants to come out and say we broke the band up? No! She shouldn't tell porkie pies. She should remember why we took the hiatus after seven years so she could go and..."</p>
