      <p>Dave Edwards came from the bench to pounce on Donald Love's fine cross midway through the second half to edge past the Bantams in a freezing first round replay.</p>
      <p>Ricketts guided Salop to a fourth round replay at former club Wolves last season and supporters are eyeing another exciting run after a clinical victory in West Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Town face a second round tie at home to another League Two side, Mansfield, on Saturday week, where they will compete for a place with the big boys in round three.</p>
      <p>"The beauty of the FA Cup is that nobody knows where it's going to take you," said Ricketts.</p>
      <p>"You're buying a ticket with no destination and you don't know where you're going to stop off along the way.</p>
      <p>"You can end up anywhere. We had a great time last year and want to do the same again.</p>
      <p>"You have to earn the right to get to the Stoke and Wolves games we had last year."</p>
      <p>Town were worthy winners at Valley Parade, though had goalkeeper Joe Murphy to thank for an outstanding first-half save to deny the hosts.</p>
      <p>Edwards came on for Brad Walker just after the break to notch his third goal in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Ricketts felt his side were below their best but took solace from still doing enough to progress. Bantams boss Gary Bowyer felt Edwards' winner was marginally offside.</p>
      <p>He added: "To be honest, and I just said to the players, I don't think we were particularly great tonight and that's not a bad sign.</p>
      <p>"I say we weren't great but we were still resolute, and hard to score against.</p>
      <p>"Yes Joe Murphy made a good save in the first half, but other than a few crosses he had very little to do.</p>
      <p>"We defend very, very well and it gives us a base in every game. We were steady without being great but it's a great sign to still win the game."</p>
      <p>On match-winner Edwards he added: "Dave has made a career out of arriving in the box.</p>
      <p>"He's finding his feet. It's not a coincidence he's physically feeling the best he has since coming back to the club and the goals are coming."</p>
