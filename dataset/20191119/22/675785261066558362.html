      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:26:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:26</time> by <a rel="author">Graham Hiscott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/graham-hiscott/</a></address>
      <p>Budget airline <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/easyjet">easyJet</a> has raked in nearly £4million a day in extra passenger charges.</p>
      <p>Add-ons from checked-in baggage to in-flight food and drink generated almost £1.4billion in the year to the end of September.</p>
      <p>The value of these “ancillary” sales was up nearly 14% on the previous year, and was worth around a fifth of easyJet’s near £6.4billion of total annual revenue.</p>
      <p>Growth in add-ons outstripped a rise in passenger numbers, which grew by 8.6% to 96 million.</p>
      <p>Ryanair’s ancillary sales soared 21% to £2billion. It came as easyJet announced plans to become the world’s first major airline to operate net-zero carbon flights across its network.</p>

      <p>The move, from yesterday, will mean it offsets all carbon ­emissions by investing in CO2-reducing projects, including tree planting.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Johan Lundgren said: “People are thinking about the potential carbon impact of different types of transport. We want to be one of the best choices.”</p>
      <p>The £25million cost over the next year equates to 25p per passenger, and compares with an expected fuel bill of £1.6billion.</p>
      <p>Mr Lundgren said it was not “a long-term solution”, adding costs were not being added on to tickets.</p>
      <p>The move, along with plans to launch package holidays, came as easyJet revealed annual profits fell 26% to £427million.</p>
