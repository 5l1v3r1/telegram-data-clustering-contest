      <h1>Bulleit Frontier Whiskey Debuts 3D-Printed Sneakers During Frontier Works Event in Dallas</h1>
      <h2>The immersive and innovative experience also featured a 3D printed bar and 3D printed cocktails.</h2>

      <p>Marking the fourth stop on its cross-country tour, the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/bulleit">Bulleit</a> 3D Printed Frontier Experience made its way to Dallas, TX recently for the debut of limited-edition Bulleit 3D Printed Sneakers. The limited-edition kicks are the product of a collaboration between Bulleit, Dallas-based artist Kyle Steed and 3D printing experts at industrial design and manufacturing firm Tangible Creative. The first-of-their-kind sneakers took more than 200 hours to develop and are the latest piece of the Frontier Works program where Bulleit champions the advancing of the cultural frontier through collaborative projects with innovative creatives who move the dial in their craft.</p>

      <p>The program is much more than a novelty for Bulleit, as it selects individuals who truly personify the brand’s boundary-pushing spirit, fostering the development of never-before-seen works.</p>
      <p>Sophie Kelly, Sr. Vice President of Whiskey at Diageo North America noted in the brand’s release that they are “seeking new collaborators and pioneers on the frontier of 3D printing who can enhance everything about our 3D printed bar experience…. Together we are reimaging the bar experience in 3D – which includes where people drink, what people drink, what people are wearing and what people are talking about.”</p>
      <p>Providing the vehicle to bridge an intangible idea into a physical form, Tangible Creative engineered the technical canvas for Steed to imprint his artistic prowess onto. The resultant work is a myriad of intertwining colorful figures that Steed thoughtfully underscored with a deeper context. The artist depicted the many human elements that come together to define community, reminding viewers of the importance of this class of innovators.</p>

      <p>Celebrating this fusion of streetwear, art, culture and technology, Bulleit hosted five events — at the historic Ervay Theater – which celebrated the creative vanguards pushing boundaries in a similar spirit as the foundations of the whiskey brand. From the historic Sixteenth Street Station in Oakland, CA to the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, NY, this most recent iteration of the Frontier Works program – the Bulleit 3D Printed Frontier Experience – remained steadfast in bringing memorable moments beyond the Dallas city limits.</p>

      <p>The immersive environment served to awaken the senses and host a night of unforgettable firsts. Guests enjoyed 3D printed cocktails created by the brand’s partners at Print A Drink, a 3D printed bar by the architecture and design practice FAR frohn&amp;rojas, world-class cocktails served up at that bar, music from popular local DJs, the unveiling of the 3D printed kicks and a live mural painting by Kyle Steed</p>
      <p>Following the event, the sneakers were sold on eCommerce sneaker site SneakerPolitics.com and sold out in under 72 hours.</p>
