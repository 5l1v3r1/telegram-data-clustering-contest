      <p>Rebel Wilson is one talented woman!</p>
      <p>The Australian actress and comedian proved that once again on Tuesday, with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/lionsgate-rebel-wilson-k-pop-comedy-seoul-girls-1202790233/"><i>Deadline</i></a> reporting that Lionsgate has just picked up “Seoul Girls”, a comedy script written by the “Pitch Perfect” star.</p>
      <p>WIlson will also produce and play a role in the film, which follows a Korean-American teenage girl as she and her friends enter a talent competition searching for an opening act for the world’s hottest K-pop boy band.</p>
      <p>“With help from an ex-member of a British girl group and a former K-pop trainee, the Seoul Girls find their voices on the world’s biggest stage,” reads the film’s synopsis.</p>

      <p>No word yet on casting or who will be tapped to direct.</p>
      <p>“Seoul Girls” is the latest project for the 39-year-old star, who earlier this year opened up about the difficulties of dating while famous.</p>
      <p>“People get very intimidated, which is weird, the idea that I would be intimidating to anyone. But it happens all the time, to the point that someone I really liked was so intimidated and got a lot of anxiety and couldn’t have a relationship with me because I’m in the public eye,” she told <a href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/rebel-wilson-may-cover"><i>InStyle</i></a>, adding that it “sucked” when she meets someone she likes who can’t come to grips with her celebrity.</p>

      <p>“If someone thinks they’re on a date with Fat Amy, that’s not going to happen,” she added. “Sorry, I can be almost as much fun, but I’m not like that in real life.”</p>
