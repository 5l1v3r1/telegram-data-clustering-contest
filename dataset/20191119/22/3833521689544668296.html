      <p>In October, he ascribed 80% odds to a Canadian recession within the coming year, and recently penned an op-ed in which he declared the global macroeconomic fundamentals “very poor.”</p>
      <p>Onex, Canada’s biggest private-equity firm founded by billionaire Gerry Schwartz, bought Gluskin Sheff in June for about $445 million (and took the company private.</p>
      <p>The chief economist and strategist will begin publication in the first quarter of next year and will write under the Gluskin Sheff banner until the transition is complete, according to his test web page. In addition to his current publications, there will be new offerings and a wider choice of services for investors.</p>
