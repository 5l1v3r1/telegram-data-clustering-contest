      <p>Bellator London 2: “MVP vs. Melillo” goes down this Saturday (Nov. 23, 2019) at SSE Arena in London, England. The main event sees feared Welterweight striker, Michael “Venom” Page (15-1), face off with Giovanni “The Punisher” Melillo (13-4) in a potential three-round war.</p>
      <p>Hold up ... Giovanni <b>who</b>? Earlier this year “The Barbaric” Derek Anderson (16-3, 1 NC) <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/11/20910094/michael-page-vs-derek-anderson-set-to-headline-bellator-london-card-this-november-mma-paramount-dazn">was scheduled</a> to face “MVP” on this card, but less than a week ago <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/12/20962361/derek-anderson-out-of-michael-page-main-event-bout-at-bellator-london">Anderson pulled out for undisclosed reasons</a>, forcing Bellator MMA to re-shuffle the deck.</p>

      <p>Bellator MMA subsequently confirmed a report from the Evening Standard that Melillo would take Anderson’s place. “The Punisher” has a 3-3 record over his last six fights, but does boast a 77 percent finishing rate in his 13 wins, with eight knockouts and two submissions.</p>
      <p>In size and stature, though, Giovanni is little match at 5’11” for the long and lanky 6’3” Page, who will undoubtedly look to add another highlight reel knockout to his long list of finishes. One could also hope he’d <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/9/27/20693125/bellator-227-henderson-vs-jury-recap-with-results-gifs-and-interviews-gallagher-mcgregor-dublin-mma">show a little more decorum</a> doing so than in his last fight.</p>
