      <p>If you’re thinking about picking up new earbuds to work with your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you’ll probably thinking about the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> from Apple. But at $249, they’re kind of a big deal to justify. Are AirPods Pro actually worth the price? Our Harris Craycraft definitely thinks so. And he’s here to convince you with a new video.</p>
      <p>AirPods Pro went on sale in October for $249. They carry a hefty premium over the regular AirPods, which remain available from Apple for $159. You might be able to find them for a bit less from some vendors running sales and other special deals, but that’s still a big nut to crack. What makes the AirPods Pro worth it?</p>

      <p>The AirPods Pro are the first AirPods to feature Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). They also feature Adaptive EQ and Transparency Mode, so you can more clearly hear what’s going on without removing the AirPods from your ear first. They come with a charging case that works wirelessly to charge up using an Qi-compatible charging mat. They’re also the first AirPods to be certified as sweat and water-resistant, making them ideal for a really intense workout or maybe even a run in the rain. They also sport nifty Force Sensor controls that work differently than the regular AirPods.</p>

      <p>Does that mean that they’re worth the almost $100 premium you’ll pay over the second-generation AirPods? We’ll let Harris do the talking in this short video.</p>
      <p>Are you convinced? Do you think AirPods Pro are a good value? Or are they a waste of money? Are you still on the fence? Sound off in the comments and let us know.</p>
