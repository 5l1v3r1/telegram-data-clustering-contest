      <p>The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is ready to prosecute those implicated in the controversial Gupta-linked Estina dairy farm project, according to media reports.</p>
      <p>The project in Vrede, the Free State, was intended to see 100 black emerging farmers receive five cows each as part of an empowerment scheme.</p>
      <p>Gifted to Estina in 2013 under a free 99-year lease by the provincial Department of Agriculture, the farm was one of the most controversial transactions between the Guptas and a government entity, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/i-do-not-trust-the-public-protector-estina-dairy-farm-project-beneficiary-20190724">News24</a> earlier reported.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/npa-ready-to-prosecute-those-implicated-in-vrede-dairy-farm-scandal-37575599">According to IOL</a>, National Director of Public Prosecutions advocate Shamila Batohi and NPA investigative directorate head advocate Hermione Cronje announced on Monday some state capture-related cases would be reinstated as Cronje's unit had gathered enough evidence.</p>
      <p>"We are waiting for the last piece of evidence from the United Arab Emirates before we can enrol the case in court," Cronje said at a round table discussion with the media at the NPA's headquarters in Pretoria on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Batohi also revealed she would declassify documents that could ultimately lead to the prosecution of former crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2019-11-19-intelligence-slush-fund-documents-to-be-declassified-says-shamila-batohi/">Business Day</a>, she revealed that national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole had written to her last week saying he had agreed to declassify "a whole range of documents that we need".</p>
      <p>In September, the commission of inquiry into state capture, chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, heard how Mdluli allegedly looted the secret service account (SSA) within crime intelligence.</p>
      <p>Hawks investigator Colonel Kobus Roelofse revealed to the commission how Mdluli had spent money from the account for security upgrades, overseas trips and various vehicles.</p>

      <p>Mdluli faced charges of fraud, theft and corruption for allegedly looting the crime intelligence slush fund, however, the charges were later withdrawn in 2011.</p>
      <p>Roelofse told the commission that this decision "did not make any sense", saying Mdluli had failed to co-operate with officers while he was under investigation for fraud and corruption relating to the SSA, News24 reported.</p>
