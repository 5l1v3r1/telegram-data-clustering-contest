      <p>Concerned viewers sent messages of support to Jacqueline Jossa as she was reduced to tears by a gruelling I’m A Celebrity Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>The actress, best known as Lauren Branning in EastEnders, was terrified as she waited for her turn during Tuesday night’s Face Your Fear trial in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>All five of the Snake Rock campmates had to put their heads into clear helmets filled with insects, rats and snakes during the test, overseen by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.</p>

      <p>After they discovered viewers had voted for which animals would join them in the helmets, Jossa said: “I feel like this is too soon to cry but I’m going to cry.”</p>
      <p>Viewers predicted Jossa, 27, would become the first contestant to shout “I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!” and forfeit the challenge after she discovered her chosen animals were spiders.</p>
      <p>But she stunned those at home by solving the puzzle and securing the maximum two stars.</p>
      <p>Viewers showed their support for the soap star online.</p>
