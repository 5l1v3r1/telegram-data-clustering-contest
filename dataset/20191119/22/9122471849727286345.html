      <h1>Former Ohio State 5-Star Noah Spence Released By NFL Team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:16:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>A former elite high school recruit was waived by his NFL team on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Washington Redskins released former five-star Ohio State recruit Noah Spence. The pass rusher failed to make a legitimate impact on the team after signing with the Redskins before the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>Washington promoted fellow defensive end Carroll Phillips from the practice squad to fill the 53-man roster.</p>
      <p>Redskins insider Kareem Copeland announced the news.</p>

      <p>Spence transferred from Ohio State to <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-football-news/report-former-ohio-state-de-noah-spence-will-transfer-to-eastern-kentucky">Eastern Kentucky</a>, where some though he would become a first-round pick. However, he slipped into the second round, where he was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He recorded 5.5 sacks as a rookie, good enough for a spot on <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000784799/article/dak-prescott-ezekiel-elliott-joey-bosa-lead-2016-allrookie-team">NFL.com’s</a> <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-football-news/ohio-state-dominated-nfl-coms-all-rookie-team">All-Rookie team</a>.</p>
      <p>Spence’s former Buckeye teammates called him the “<a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-football-news/ohio-states-michael-thomas-says-former-buckeyes-star-noah-spence-is-next-von-miller-super-bowl-50">next Von Miller</a>,” and Urban Meyer <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-football-news/urban-meyer-raves-about-noah-spence-was-shocked-he-didnt-go-in-1st-round">was shocked</a> that he didn’t go in the first round. He hasn’t become the next Von Miller and is about to be on his third team in the last year.</p>
      <p>It’s a tough fall for one of the nation’s most-talented players coming out of high school. At just 25 years old, there’s still time for Spence to turn things around.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest on Spence and from the NFL.</p>
