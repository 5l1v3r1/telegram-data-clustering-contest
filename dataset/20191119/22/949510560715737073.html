      <p>CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago police say an officer was shot in the head during a “gun battle” on the city’s Northwest Side.</p>
      <p>Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says the officer was struck Tuesday night during a shootout with a bank robbery suspect. The officer was taken to a nearby hospital.</p>
      <p>Guglielmi initially said the officer only suffered a graze wound and was responsive, but the spokesman now says the bullet “did penetrate and exit” the officer’s skull and that the injuries are more serious than the preliminary diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are expected to give more details at a press conference late Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Police haven’t revealed information about the suspect.</p>
