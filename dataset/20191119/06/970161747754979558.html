        <b>Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) has been busy planning her dream wedding to Dr Liam Cavanagh (Jonny McPherson) in Emmerdale, but she gets the surprise of her life when daughter Dee Dee returns in the coming episodes. However, Dee Dee ends up making a shocking discovery — and it’s one that could change everything.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The week of Bernice and Liam’s wedding arrives, and Bernice is stressed when Liam reveals he’s got her a gift for their big day. Yes, she goes into meltdown over the fact that she hasn’t got him one, and thus sets about rectifying the situation.</p>
      <p>However, that proves to be the last thing on her mind when Dee Dee reveals that she’s starting school in Emmerdale as a wedding present for her mum. As a result, Bernice is rather overwhelmed, so —instead of acquiring a gift— she sets about making a grand gesture to Liam instead.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Leanna (Mimi Slinger) is rather hurt that Bernice never asked for her help in deciding said gift, which leads to some more conflict. However, Bernice decides that Leanna could help organise the hen do instead.</p>

      <p>When the hen party arrives, Bernice’s daughters are mortified when a stripper shows up. However, that’s the least of her worries, as — during the celebrations — she misses several calls on her phone.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dee Dee takes a call — and ends up having a shocking revelation that could change everything.</p>
      <p>What is it that Dee Dee’s learned?</p>
      <p>What’s more, will it prevent the wedding from going ahead?</p>
