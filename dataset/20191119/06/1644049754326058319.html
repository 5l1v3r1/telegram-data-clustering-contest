      <p>Arms covered in cling film and torches in hand as they drop into the sewers, clusters of pro-democracy protesters still inside a Hong Kong campus are plotting increasingly ingenious — and desperate — ways to escape a police siege.</p>
      <p>Among the detritus of a scorched and graffiti-sprayed concourse at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, several plastic covers — some with torches placed above them — betray extraordinary underground escape plans.</p>
      <p>Protesters have removed metal manholes, some making exploratory forays into the fetid tunnels, following rumours of successful exfiltrations from a campus ringed for three days by baton-wielding police determined to arrest them.</p>
      <p>Pockets of protesters, some with thick bandages wrapped around their knees in anticipation of a long crawl to freedom, knot the holes discussing an unlikely — and highly dangerous — breakout.</p>
      <p>AFP reporters saw one group on their stomachs practising crawling. Another group hugged each other in consolation after apparently agreeing not to take the route down into the unknown.</p>
      <p>“The people outside can’t help us,” a protester told local television as he prepared to descend into a sewer. “So what can we do?”</p>
      <p>One protester, gas mask on, and cling film wrapped around his arms, carried a torch as he descended with his backpack down the metal rungs into the subterranean gloom.</p>
      <p>Desperation has stalked the protesters for two days since an occupation of the city centre campus turned into a police siege.</p>
      <p>“We can get through today… I don’t know about tomorrow,” Fung, 43, a kitchen volunteer helping feed protesters in a campus canteen told AFP on Monday.</p>
      <p>So far the daring escape bids have been matched by their danger.</p>
      <p>Late on Monday dozens of protesters in civilian clothes slid down several metres of rope onto a flyover, where a cavalcade of motorbikes conducted a smash and grab rescue mission.</p>
      <p>Police said 37 of the escapees and bike drivers were later arrested — but many others are thought to have got away.</p>
      <h3>‘Liberty or Death’</h3>
      <p>Earlier Monday scores of protesters faced a gauntlet of batons from Hong Kong’s bruising riot cops as they made a dash along another bridge.</p>
      <p>Some escaped but images showed those who did not on the receiving end of brutal flurries of baton strikes, kicks and stamps.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday a group of around 20 protesters who had moved from the campus into a nearby commercial building overnight slipped away, after riot police left their post.</p>
      <p>“It’s at most 10 years in jail if I am convicted of rioting,” said Issac, aged 17. “But it will be a whole life in a larger prison if I stop coming out.”</p>
      <p>Under-18s have also been escorted out by teachers — their details taken but not immediately arrested on exit from the campus — while Monday was pock-marked by sporadic failed escape bids by clusters of protesters.</p>
      <p>Inside, desolation has replaced defiance.</p>
      <p>“Liberty or Death” has been sprayed on the glass entrance to one building, where a 7/11 has been looted and a Bank of China ATM has been smashed up.</p>
      <p>Classroom furniture, bottles for petrol bombs, mats, bollards and bins are chaotically piled across the campus, whose walls are scarred by scorch marks from large fires.</p>
      <p>Black clothes, the colour of a rebellion whose narrow initial aims against a specific law have widened into calls for democracy in Hong Kong, are strewn everywhere as the mainly young activists shed protest ‘uniforms’ before making a break for it.</p>
      <p>A hardcore contingent remains, willing to defend the campus despite stark warnings by police that officers are ready to use lethal force if they come under attack.</p>
      <p>Tears in his eyes, exhausted and injured in one leg, Wong explained the dilemma of a youth movement whose lives have been upended by months of protest.</p>
      <p>“If I give up can I face those who have sacrificed?” he said, of those arrested in the campus siege.</p>
      <p>“I don’t mind giving up my future so that others can step on our bodies and keep going forward.”</p>
