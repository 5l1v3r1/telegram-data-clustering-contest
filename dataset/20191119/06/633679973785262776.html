      <p>Short-form video giant TikTok is still gaining traction.</p>
      <p>According to data from <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-1-5-billion">analytics site Sensor Tower</a> TikTok has hit 1.5 billion total downloads across the App Store and Google Play. It <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-hit-1-billion-downloads-surpassing-instagram-in-2018-2019-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">hit 1 billion</a> downloads in February of this year, and has raked in 614 million downloads so far this year - which Sensor Tower notes is 6% more than this time last year.</p>
      <p>Much of TikTok's growth has been driven by an explosion of users in India, who accounted for 31% of the app's downloads. Its second-biggest market was China which made up 11.5% of downloads, then the US with 8.2%.</p>
      <p>TikTok is becoming a growing threat to Facebook, especially given its popularity with the younger Generation Z, a demographic Facebook is eager to recapture. Sensor Tower reports that TikTok was the third most-downloaded app behind WhatsApp and Messenger, but came ahead of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
      <p>Essentially, TikTok is the only app in the top five that isn't owned by Facebook.</p>
