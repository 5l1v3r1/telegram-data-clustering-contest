      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday ordered review of the new military-style uniform of marshals in the House, a move which comes following criticism by some ex-Army officers and remarks of opposition leaders.</p>
      <p>Uniforms of Rajya Sabha marshals were restyled from traditional Indian attire comprising turbans to dark navy blue and olive green military-style outfits with caps.</p>
      <p>Naidu mentioned in the House that the Secretariat of Rajya Sahba had come out with a new dress code for marshals.</p>
      <p>However, there have been suggestions and comments by politicians and well-meaning individuals on the same, he said. "I have decided to ask the Secretariat to revisit the same," Naidu said.</p>
      <p>On Monday, when the marshals came wearing the new uniform together with aiguillette, some members commented if "marshal law was being imposed."</p>
      <p>Customarily, the presiding officer of the House is flanked by two marshals who march ahead of the chairman to announce the commencement of proceedings and also assist the</p>
      <p>chair in organising the desk and bringing up order papers. Marshals earlier wore safari suits during summer and Indian bandgalas during the winter along with turbans.</p>
      <p>The turbans were viewed by some as colonial legacy, leading to review of the uniform. On Monday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had sought to raise a point on the marshals' new uniform.</p>
      <p>"Sir, the marshals...," he began only to be interrupted by Naidu. Ramesh, however, insisted that there has been "a very significant change" in their attire.</p>
      <p>"Okay. You always make significant point at an insignificant time," Naidu had remarked on Monday.</p>
      <p>Some former Army officers have also criticised the new uniforms for marshals, terming them as illegal.</p>
