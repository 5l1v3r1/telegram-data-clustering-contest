      <p>A pregnant mum burst into tears at the side of the road when a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/public-transport">bus</a> driver abandoned them - because he had no change.</p>
      <p>Clare Storton, who is seven months pregnant, was going to see her friend in Willerby with her two-year-old daughter on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old had wanted to get the bus there from a roundabout, but after seeing that it would not arrive for another 20 minutes, she decided to walk on until it came.</p>
      <p>After walking two miles, she found herself exhausted near the Esso petrol station in Kingston Road by the time the next East Yorkshire Bus had arrived, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/pregnant-mum-stranded-bus-tears-3550413">Hull Live</a> says.</p>
      <p>The company has since apologised for leaving Clare in tears.</p>

      <p>"I only wanted to go two stops ahead because I literally couldn't walk any further," she said. "I'd already done quite a substantial walk.</p>
      <p>"So I got on and put the fiver down, but he said I was going to struggle with that because he didn't have any change."</p>
      <p>Clare said the driver asked if she had anything smaller, but she only had a fiver to pay for the return journey from her home in Wold Road to her friend's house.</p>
      <p>"I asked, 'Can't you just let me off?', I'm seven months pregnant and had a child with me, clearly struggling. But he said no," she said.</p>
      <p>She said she was offered an IOU but could not accept it as she would have had no money to get home again.</p>
      <p>Eventually she was told she would have to get off the bus.</p>
      <p>"I just burst out crying and my little girl burst out crying so we were both just stood there crying," she said.</p>
      <p>"I use that bus service four days a week to take my little girl to nursery and to go to work.</p>
      <p>"And I'm sorry but it's just two stops and if somebody's in need, you help them. I pay every day and I work and pay mortgage, I don't just expect stuff and bum off the system."</p>
      <p>Clare said she left her home for the five-minute bus journey at 12pm but didn't end up arriving at her friend's house until after 1.30pm.</p>
      <p>She said "Where's the compassion in people anymore? You can see I'm heavily pregnant and struggling along with a two year old and a big bump.</p>
      <p>"I think it's appalling they would treat me that way. They're like robots.</p>
      <p>"And what kind of world are we living in when a bus has no money on? They think nobody uses cash anymore."</p>
      <p>Head of commercial at East Yorkshire Buses, Bob Rackley, said: "We are sorry about this, we don't like any situations where somebody is left like this and we do everything we can to avoid it.</p>
      <p>"It's difficult for drivers to have a large amount of change all the time and most of them will change notes to help people out.</p>
      <p>"But they're not always able to have change so we have the credit ticket exchange system where you can use the extra money on another bus or the contactless card system which eradicates the need for change altogether."</p>
