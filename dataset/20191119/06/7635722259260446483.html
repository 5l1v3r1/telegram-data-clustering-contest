        <b>Gardaí are expected to launch a murder investigation after a man's body was found in a burning car in west Dublin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to the Mount Andrew Court area in Lucan at around 8pm last night.</p>
      <p>A car that was set on fire was extinguished and the man's body was discovered.</p>
      <p>It is suspected he had been shot before the car was set on fire.</p>
      <p>The body remains at the scene this morning, with the area around the car sealed off.</p>
      <p>Gardaí say the results of the post mortem examination will determine the course of their investigation.</p>
      <p>They are appealing for anyone who might have any information to contact them.</p>
      <p>One man who lives near the scene told <i>Newstalk</i> that it's not the first time something like this has happened.</p>
      <p>He observed: "Two or three months ago, in a housing estate across the way, there was a car burned out.</p>
      <p>"In the space of two-three months, there's been two cars burnt out in parallel housing estates, and there was one body found - possibly shot. It's very scary."</p>
