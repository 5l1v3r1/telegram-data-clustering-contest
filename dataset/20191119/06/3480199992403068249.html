      <p>Funding of up to £175,000 is available for up to 40 per cent of a project and is therefore a fantastic way to secure capital to enable projects to go ahead.</p>
      <p>The Growth Programme grants are available to farms and rural businesses who are looking to expand or diversify.</p>
      <p>The government has also launched a new £50 million Woodland Carbon Guarantee scheme to encourage farmers and landowners to plant more trees and help tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>It gives land managers in England long-term financial income to invest in carbon sequestration – the process by which trees lock up and store carbon from the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Successful participants will be offered the option to sell Woodland Carbon Units to the government over 35 years at a guaranteed price set by auction, providing new income for land managers who help businesses compensate for their carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>To apply for the Woodland Carbon Guarantee, you can register projects with the Woodland Carbon Code – the voluntary standard for UK woodland creation projects where claims are made about the carbon dioxide they sequester.</p>
