      <h1>Arsenal: It’s important to still support the club, even now</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are in a rough patch, and fans are naturally a bit upset, but it’s more important than ever to still maintain support of the club.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/mgibbons2/" target="_blank">Marc Gibbons</a></address>
      <p>This past weekend represents the first weekend in years where I genuinely haven’t missed Premiership football. My interest has been slowly waning over the last few weeks with each disjointed and poor performance. I am, however, an <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> fan and now with a consistent run of fixtures over the next couple of months, it’s important to bring myself back up again and support the team and that goes for everyone.</p>
      <p>Over the last few weeks, all I have seen is comments from fans saying that they are hoping for a poor performance or a defeat in the hopes that it pushes Unai Emery closer to the sack.</p>
      <p>That is not a fan. Regardless of what you think of Emery and whether you want him to be at the club, we should want Arsenal to win every game. I’m not a fan of Emery and I want him out just as much as the next fan, however I support the club.</p>
      <p>Besides, what good is it going to do? The board have spoken and the current stance is that his job is safe for now. That may change over the coming weeks, but for now he is still our manager.</p>
      <p>On a positive side of things, I believe that Unai Emery knows that his position is in danger and he also knows that the board won’t afford anymore piss poor performances. So <i>hopefully,</i> and I say this still with a shade of doubt, hopefully we will see Emery change things and allow us to deliver some positive performances and results with some very winnable fixtures coming up.</p>
      <p>However the <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/">next few results</a> go and if we do get a few wins, I am still absolutely confident that Unai Emery is not the man to lead the club forward. He is still well out of his depth.</p>
      <p>The atmosphere at the Emirates has long been criticized and known for being more like a library. Recent events are certainly not going to improve this and it’s likely that on Saturday, we can expect a subdued and even toxic atmosphere. Especially if we are struggling in the opening 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>Regardless, I will still be there trying to be positive and it’s important all other fans do too. Fan negativity can have an impact on players and with the current disharmony at the club we should try to offer a little encouragement and not jump on a players back every time they don’t complete a pass.</p>
      <p>I’m not saying that if we do all this, that the good times are going to come back. Far from it. In fact I think we are a good few years away from the good times. But I will still support the team whether we are a big club, small club, in the Premiership or League 2. I’m a football fan. And maybe if we have a bit more positively we may enjoy our football again.</p>
