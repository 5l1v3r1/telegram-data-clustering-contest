      <h1>Olyroo trio banned from Olympics, but skipper remains eligible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:52:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:52</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Lynch</a></address>
      <p>Melbourne City duo Nathaniel Atkinson and Lachlan Wales, along with Perth Glory's Brandon Wilson, will miss the Olympics – if Australia qualifies – after being banned from international football until August 2020 following a complaint about their conduct while away on Olyroo duty in Cambodia earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Olyroo captain Riley McGree – who is now at Adelaide United but was at City at the time of the complaint by a woman – was also banned, but only until April of next year.</p>

      <p>McGree will, as a result, be eligible to play in the Tokyo 2020 tournament if Australia make it and coach Graham Arnold picks him.</p>
      <p>All four will also have to take part in education courses and counselling as directed by the FFA.</p>
      <p>The sanction follows a finding that the players engaged in conduct in breach of the FFA's Code of Conduct during the Asian Football Confederation U-23 Championship qualifying tournament in Cambodia in March this year, the FFA said after a lengthy probe into the case.</p>

      <p>"The matter came to the attention of FFA in April 2019 following a complaint by a woman. FFA initiated an independent investigation shortly after the complaint was received and due to its complexity, the investigation took months to complete," the organisation said on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"The FFA Board considered the findings of the investigation in early October 2019 and subsequently determined to initiate its Code of Conduct process, which involved providing each Player with the opportunity to make submissions to FFA on the alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct.</p>
      <p>"FFA considered those submissions, including submissions made by Professional Footballers Australia, in reaching its determination which was communicated to the Players today."</p>
      <p>FFA Chairman Chris Nikou said: "These sanctions are commensurate to the nature of the breaches of the National Code of Conduct which is in place to safeguard both the players and the reputation of Australian football.</p>
      <p>"Upholding our commitment to respect and responsibility cannot be compromised. Our game is built on equality, inclusivity and respect and these are values that we will continue to uphold.</p>
      <p>"The players have understood the gravity of their actions and have positively commenced respectful relationship programs that will ensure they appreciate these values in the future."</p>
      <p>All four had been scheduled to travel to Asia on November 9 as part of the current Olyroo squad which has been playing warm-up games in China ahead of the final series of Olympic qualifiers next January.</p>
      <p>But as a result of their pending sanction, none of the quartet travelled with their international colleagues.</p>
      <p>Any of the four can appeal FFA's determination in respect of their sanction to the independent FFA Disciplinary and Ethics Committee. A subsequent appeal may also be made to the Independent FFA Appeals Committee.</p>
