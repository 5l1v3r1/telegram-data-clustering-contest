      <p>A suburban Chinese restaurant in Perth’s south has been hit with more than $20,000 in fines and legal costs after being convicted of three food safety breaches.</p>
      <p>Baldivis Chinese BBQ Restaurant on Atwick Terrace was hit with the infringements after an inspection by City of Rockingham health and safety officers.</p>
      <p>The offences included failing to store food in a way that protected it from contamination, and failing to store potentially hazardous food under temperature control.</p>
      <p>The restaurant was also caught out not maintaining the premises “to an acceptable standard of cleanliness”.</p>
      <p>The owner of the restaurant, who refused to give her full name, said the fines were for “a very small matter”.</p>
      <p>She said she did not want to elaborate on the fines.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said the City of Rockingham was “unable to provide any further comment” on the issue.</p>
      <p>The restaurant was fined $20,000 in total and forced to pay $1813 in costs.</p>
