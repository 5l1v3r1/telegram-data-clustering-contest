      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Yesterday, we discussed the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/18/bitcoin-btc-diving-can-bulls-protect-8-2k-support/">chances of a breakdown</a> in bitcoin towards the $8,200 support against the US Dollar. BTC did decline in the past three sessions and broke the $8,340 and $8,320 support levels.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the price failed to stay above the key $8,200 support level and settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average. It traded close to the $8,000 level and a new monthly low was formed near $8,033.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the price is correcting higher above the $8,100 level. It is consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent slide from the $8,630 swing high to $8,033 low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $8,180 and $8,200 levels. Besides, there is a short term declining channel forming with resistance near $8,165 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>It bitcoin climbs above the channel resistance, it could test the $8,300 and $8,320 resistance levels. The previous major support near $8,320 is now likely to act as a crucial resistance for bitcoin. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent slide from the $8,630 swing high to $8,033 low is near the $8,330 level.</p>
      <p>The main downtrend resistance is now near $8,450, $8,560, a couple of bearish trend lines, and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Therefore, a daily close above the $8,560 resistance is needed to start a decent recovery in the near term.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the price could continue to move down towards $8,000. Furthermore, if there is a downside break below the $8,000 support, the bulls are likely to give up. The next major support is seen near the $7,650 level.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin price is clearly trading in a strong downtrend below the $8,320 and $8,560 resistance levels. Thus, it remains a sell until there is a daily close above $8,560.</p>
