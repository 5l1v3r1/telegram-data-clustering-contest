      <h3>Roy Keane says reported Manchester United target Declan Rice needs to improve in a lot of areas.</h3>
      <p>The 20-year-old has been regularly linked with a move to Manchester United over the past couple of months.</p>
      <p>A report in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7641335/Manchester-United-make-80m-rated-Declan-Rice-target-summer-make-January-move.html">Daily Mail</a> earlier this month suggested Rice was Manchester United’s top target ahead of the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>The West Ham midfielder fits the bill for the type of player that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted since taking over the reins of the club.</p>
      <p>Rice is an English talent with plenty of potential to be moulded into a top Premier League star.</p>
      <p>The London-born star represented the Republic of Ireland on three occasions in friendlies before Rice decided to switch allegiance to England.</p>
      <p>His former Irish coach Keane believes Rice has to make a lot of improvements to his game to become a top player.</p>
      <p>“Where he needs to improve, there are plenty of aspects if you think about it,” Keane told <i>ITV Sport</i> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Over the last few months he has had a lot of praise, I worked with him while he was with the Ireland squad.</p>
      <p>“Where does he need to improve, where do you want me to start?</p>
      <p>“His positional play I don’t think is consistent enough, he doesn’t stay with runners, he’s sloppy in possession.</p>
      <p>“I can go on.”</p>
      <p>Rice has been a regular in the West Ham team since Manuel Pellegrini’s appointment at the start of the 2018-19 season.</p>
      <p>The England international has featured in all 1080 minutes of West Ham’s Premier League football so far this season to underline his importance to Hammers boss Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>The West Ham No41 has scored two goals in 82 games in all competitions over the past three seasons for the east London outfit.</p>
