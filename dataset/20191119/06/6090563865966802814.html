      <p>Two people have been killed due to strong winds and heavy rains that uprooted a tree and fell on a parked car they were underneath in Zimbabwe’s capital city, Harare, on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The tragic incident occurred at around 13:30 in Mbare suburb with the now deceased reported to have died on spot.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed the death of the duo.</p>
      <p>The tragic event comes barely a day after heavy rains also killed one person and left vast livestock and property destroyed across the country’s remote areas.</p>
      <p>The death quickly reignites the Cyclone Idai sad memories of last rain season where hundreds of lives were lost and some reported missing up to date.</p>
      <p>Mbare’ s incident eyewitnesses said the fatalities occurred just by the blink of the eye leading to the fatalities.</p>
      <p>“I was selling airtime close by when it started raining heavily, while l was still on my way to look for shelter l head a loud bang, when l turned back only to see that an uprooted tree had landed on top of a parked car.</p>
      <p>“We rushed to assist shortly, only to see the two already dead,” said a vendor who identified herself as Mai Tino.</p>
      <p>The rains also ravaged some parts of Harare with property worth millions destroyed, although quantification was still under way by end of day.</p>
