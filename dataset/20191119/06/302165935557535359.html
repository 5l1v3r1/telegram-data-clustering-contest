      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 19 — Being in an aircrew is more than just serving passengers their meals and showing them to their seats.</p>
      <p>A Lion Air flight attendant went the extra mile when he assisted a senior citizen passenger during mealtime by feeding her.</p>
      <p>The elderly passenger, who was reportedly 117 years old, was travelling from Surabaya to Palangkaraya on the Indonesian low-cost carrier.</p>
      <p>Instagram user Armaini Imay, who was on the flight, captured the heart-warming gesture.</p>
      <p>In the post, Armaini said she was amazed to see the dedication of an aircrew member for patiently serving the centenarian.</p>
      <p>The anxious flyer initially refused to put on a seatbelt and asked to come back down from the aircraft.</p>

      <p>“With such loving care, the flight attendant gave her a beverage, fed her gently as though she was his own mother and managed to coax her to wear a seatbelt in the end,” Armaini observed.</p>
      <p>Following the post, social media users praised the caring and sympathetic cabin crew member.</p>
      <p>“Dear Lion Air flight attendant, whoever you are, you exemplify the perfect flight attendant,” chimed in @the4rel who shared the video on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Do you miss your mother? You’re so meticulous in helping this old lady.”</p>
