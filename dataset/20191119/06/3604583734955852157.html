      <h1>Rainbow Serpent Festival drug-taker and paramedic basher James Haberfield non-custodial sentence appeal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Caroline Schelle</a></address>
      <p>A Victorian paramedic was in tears in court reliving the moment a drug-crazed attacker choked her, as prosecutors argued the basher should have been jailed for the crime.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are in the Victorian County Court appealing the decision to allow convicted paramedic basher James Haberfield to avoid jail.</p>
      <p>The then 21-year-old attacked his victim after he fled a hospital following a four-day bender at the Rainbow Serpent music festival.</p>
      <p>He was on a cocktail of drugs at the Lexton festival including ice, MDMA, ketamine and LSD at the time, the court was told.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors believe Haberfield should already be behind bars due to mandatory sentencing laws aimed at people who attack emergency workers - but the laws also allow for "special reasons" attackers can avoid prison.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Simon Zebrowski decided in August not to send Haberfield to jail because of his age, pre-existing autism spectrum disorder and increased risk of suicide in custody.</p>

      <p>Paramedic Monica, who didn't want her surname used, told the court she suffered flashbacks.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I'm constantly being choked and suffocating," she said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>She was often triggered into panic attacks and suffered ongoing "distressing flashbacks" where she tries to escape the ambulance.</p>
      <p>Monica has not been able to return to work as a paramedic due to her psychological and physical injuries.</p>
      <p>Haberfield's family took him to hospital after Rainbow Serpent but he fled and walked into a Coburg home, terrifying the residents.</p>
      <p>When paramedics arrived, Haberfield punched Monica's face, put her in a headlock, and squeezed and pinned her to the back door of the ambulance.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty to recklessly causing injury to an emergency worker and assaulting an emergency worker and was freed.</p>
      <p>But prosecutors argued it was not open to Mr Zebrowski to impose any sentence other than a jail term as required by the legislation.</p>

      <p>Judge Michael Tinney told the court he had been up until midnight looking at the relevant laws.</p>
      <p>The new law "significantly fetters" his sentencing discretion, he said.</p>
      <p>Haberfield's lawyer argued his client's impaired mental functioning was caused by recently diagnosed schizophrenia and not just his drug use.</p>
      <p>Forensic psychiatrist Andrew Carroll told the court Haberfield had schizophrenia and was "acutely psychotic" during the attack.</p>
      <p>Taking the drugs together with his undiagnosed illness was like "pouring petrol" on a fire, he said.</p>
      <p>"The illicit substances acted as a potent fuel which severely exacerbated his mental state," Dr Carroll told the court.</p>

      <p>But the psychiatrist said if Haberfield didn't take the cocktail of drugs his "severely acute disturbance" in January would not have happened.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said they received "absolutely no notice" about the schizophrenia diagnosis and wanted their own medical expert.</p>
      <p>"There needs to be a really strong message that any assault of a paramedic or an emergency worker doing their job can't be tolerated," Victorian Ambulance Union secretary Danny Hill said outside court.</p>
      <p>The appeal has been adjourned until December.</p>
