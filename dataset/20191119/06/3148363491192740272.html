      <p>On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Representative Lee Zeldin (R-NY) argued that President Trump should not testify before Congress.</p>
      <p>Zeldin said, “I wouldn’t encourage the president at all. It would be a heck no from me, as far as my advice as to whether or not he should come testify. … The president wouldn’t just be lowering himself to Adam Schiff’s level. He would be lowering himself below Adam Schiff’s level.”</p>
