      <p>JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has intercepted four rockets fired toward its territory from Syria.</p>
      <p>The military says no Israeli communities were harmed by the rocket fire early Tuesday. Warning sirens had blared in the Golan Heights.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from Syria. The SANA state news agency reported that explosions were heard near Damascus International Airport, indicating a potential Israeli retaliatory strike.</p>
      <p>The rocket fire comes a week after an alleged Israeli airstrike against a top Palestinian militant based in Syria. Akram al-Ajouri, a member of Islamic Jihad’s leadership living in exile, survived the attack but his son and granddaughter were killed.</p>
      <p>Israel frequently strikes Iranian interests in Syria. But last week’s airstrike appeared to be a rare assassination attempt of a Palestinian militant in the Syrian capital.</p>
