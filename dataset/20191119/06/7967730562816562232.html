      <p>More than 30 prescribed burns are under way across the state, with several burning around the Perth metro area.</p>
      <p>As the smoke may reduce visibility on roads, motorists are warned to take extra care, turn on their headlights and travel at appropriate speeds.</p>
      <p>People with asthma and pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular illnesses are advised to follow a prepared treatment plan while those with conditions exacerbated by smoke should take precautions in line with their medical advice.</p>
      <p>Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Steph Bond said the smoke was expected to clear overnight.</p>
      <p>“There’s going to be strong winds increasing in strength tonight and also showers developing over the metro area, so that will help clear the smoke,” she said.</p>
