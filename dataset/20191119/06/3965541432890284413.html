      <p>Consumer Reports is out with its annual auto reliability ratings, and once again this year Japanese brands—led by Lexus, Mazda, and Toyota, in that order—continue to top the list.</p>
      <p>Porsche moved up to number 4, followed by Genesis, Hyundai and Subaru.</p>
      <p>Dodge ranked 8. Kia and Mini round out the top 10.</p>
      <p>"The Korean brands, and that would be Genesis, Hyundai and Kia, are really making inroads into having top-level reliable performers," said Mike Quincy with Consumer Reports Autos.</p>
      <p>Consumer reports said problems with new and redesigned models caused Acura, Volkswagen and Audi to plummet in the latest reliability rankings.</p>
      <p>In fact, 45 percent of the new or redesigned vehicles in this survey had below-average predicted reliability.</p>
      <p>[And that's a pretty startling number and certainly enough evidence to show that getting one of these new or redesigned models is not a good idea," Quincy told me. "In other words, try not to be the first person on your block with a new hot car."</p>
