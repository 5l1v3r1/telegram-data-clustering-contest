      <p><b>LONDON – November 19, 2019: </b>Crypto Millions Lotto, the world’s biggest bitcoin lottery, is proud to announce that it is the “Official Online Lottery Partner” of English Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., better known as Wolves. </p>
      <p>The partnership is groundbreaking. While many Premier League clubs have collaborated with sports betting partners, this is the first involving an online lottery business.</p>
      <p>Wolves is quickly becoming known in cryptocurrency circles as the “go-to” club – like bitcoin itself, a “challenger” brand, challenging the Premiership hierarchy. Crypto Millions Lotto has chosen Wolves for this reason, as it introduces its brand to a global audience, particularly across Asia, Latin America, Canada, Russia and the CIS. </p>
      <p>One of the most significant features of the partnership is the major step it represents in bringing the world’s most widely used alternative currency further into the mainstream. Wolves and Crypto Millions Lotto are doing their part to encourage bitcoin usage and adoption along with Crypto Millions Lotto’s unique referrer program, operated through sister site <a href="http://www.earnbitcoin.world/">www.earnbitcoin.world</a>. This allows registered users to receive referral fees in bitcoin and compete for a US$2.5 million prize without even buying a lottery ticket. </p>
      <p>Commenting on the partnership, Crypto Millions Lotto CEO Sulim Malook, stated, “We are delighted to have found a partner that has the same disruptive ethos as ourselves. Wolves’ success last year has put the club’s name on the world stage in a sport that is by far the most watched on the planet. As a company, we are big football fans, and Wolves is the most crypto-friendly club in England. They were an obvious choice.”</p>
      <p>Steve Morton, head of commercial at Wolves, said, “We’re delighted to partner with Crypto Millions Lotto, an ambitious company that is keen to increase its exposure with the help of Wolves’ global reach across various platforms. We’re also excited to develop our relationship, which will also see the Wolves brand reach new audiences in Eastern Europe and South America.”</p>
