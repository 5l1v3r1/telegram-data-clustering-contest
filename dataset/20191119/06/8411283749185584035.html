      <p>High-end FPGA chips demand is mounting significantly for datacenter, 5G and AIoT applications, providing growth momentum for related wafer foundry, analysis and test players as well as channel distributors, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>The sources said as global web giants including Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, Facebook and Google have reactivated construction of large-size datacenters, first-tier chipmaker Xilinx's shipments of high-end FPGA solutions have continued trending upward. China's Huawei/HiSilicon is also aggressively proceeding with in-house development of diverse FPGA chip solutions to cut dependence on US suppliers.</p>
      <p>IC analysis firms Integrated Service Technology (iST) and Materials Analysis Technology (MA-tek), wafer probing specialist King Yuan Electronics, and channel distributor Answer Technology are all poised to embrace ever-expanding demand for high performance computing (HPC) FPGA chips in the 5G and AI era, the sources continued.</p>
      <p>Xilinx has performed well in the HPC application domain, having rolled out a range of smart chips solutions ranging from cloud networking and edge applications. The company has landed orders for FPGAs from new clients for datacenter, edge computing and autonomous driving applications through its distribution agent Answer Technology.</p>
      <p>The distribution agent noted that Xilinx is set to release ACAP (adaptive computer acceleration platform) products in 2020, which will be built by TSMC using 7nm process node, and will also present solutions integrating ACAP, FPGA, CPU, GPU, distributed memory and programmable digital signal processor chips to cover the cloud computing and edge computing integration market.</p>
      <p>The distributor is also promoting Xilinx's latest RF SoC , the first of its kind able to support 5G transmission, which is pending validations by prospective clients keen to incorporate the new solution for national defense, aerospace and communication networking applications.</p>
