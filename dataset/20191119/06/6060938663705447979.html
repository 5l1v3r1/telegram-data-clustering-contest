      <h1>Stimac's boys need to develop a winning mentality: Bhutia</h1>

      <p>KOCHI: India are set to take on Oman in the second round of World Cup qualifiers in Muscat on Tuesday and scoring goals remains to be a huge worry for head coach Igor Stimac. Out of the four matches which India played so far in the World Cup qualifiers, Stimac's boys have conceded only four goals but managed to score only three.</p>
      <p>Apart from skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sunil-chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a>, none of the Indian forwards was able to pose a real threat in the opposition half. Former Indian skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, who scored 40 international goals for the country, pointed out that though India's game has improved a lot in the past five years, the team needs to find a permanent solution to the goal-scoring problems.</p>
      <p>"We need more people to score goals. You cannot only rely on Sunil (Chhetri) to score goals. If Sunil doesn't score, the team struggles to win which is not a good sign," said Bhutia who was in the city to launch the Bhaichung Bhutia Football School's Residential Academy in Malappuram. "We are playing well and the standard of the game also is very good but we are not able to get that result which we want," he said during an exclusive interaction with TOI.</p>
      <p>Bhutia feels that the national coach should take some time to inject a winning mentality into the national players. "I don't blame strikers alone for India's current performance. I think the team as a whole needs to build a winning mentality. Stimac needs to work with the players to develop that winning instinct," he said.</p>
      <p>"After the Qatar and Oman matches, the expectations were quite high. We need to keep that momentum especially when you play lower-ranked teams. For that, I think a winning mentality has to come. No doubt that we played well against Bangladesh and Afghanistan but playing well may not be enough sometimes, you should be result oriented. The games were okay but since we expected India to get six points against Bangladesh and Afghanistan, the results were a bit disappointing," he added.</p>
      <p>It is not a secret that apart from Chhetri, Indian strikers are struggling to get enough game-time in the country's major leagues- ISL and I-League. The coaches in both leagues mostly prefer foreign strikers over Indians which has seriously affected the quality of Indian forwards. But Bhutia is not willing to blame coaches alone saying that the players too need to take the effort to improve their game. "ISL coaches too are under pressure to win matches. They are here not to produce Indian strikers or Indian goalkeepers. As a player, you need to perform well to earn a place in the squad. In terms of producing players, I think everyone involved in football is important. Sunil is playing regularly because he has quality and the rest of the boys should be aiming to achieve that quality. Obviously, we need to produce quality players especially in the forward position," said Bhutia.</p>
