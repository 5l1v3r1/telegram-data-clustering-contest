      <p>Veteran rocker Eddie Van Halen was reportedly hospitalized with abdominal pain last week amid his alleged battle with throat cancer.<br/><br/>The Van Halen star was recently said to have been diagnosed with the disease back in 2000, and has allegedly spent the past five years traveling back and forth between the U.S. and Germany for radiation treatment.<br/><br/>According to TMZ, the guitar great suffered a bad reaction to prescription drugs he's been taking to combat the illness, and ended up spending a few days under doctors' care for intestinal and abdominal issues.<br/><br/>He was discharged on Sunday and has since returned home, where he has been spending quality time with his son and bandmate, Wolfgang.<br/><br/>The 64 year old has yet to comment on the news of his cancer battle, which he apparently believes is related to his years-long penchant for holding a metal guitar pick in his mouth.</p>
