      <h1>Why Nottingham Forest must not settle for second best at Bristol City and QPR</h1>
      <h2>Reds legend Kenny Burns looks ahead to Forest's return to action with two tough away dates in Championship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest will be targeting six points from the next two away games, starting with this weekend’s trip to Bristol City and nothing less.</p>
      <p>I’ve got no doubt in my mind that <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-january-transfer-news-3537390">Sabri Lamouchi</a> will have his team being positive at Ashton Gate, and again a few days later when the Reds and Mark Warburton are reunited in west London.</p>
      <p>It seems daft to say you want six points because you want to win every game, but on your travels, you are usually happy with a point, especially in this league.</p>
      <p>The Robins and QPR will both provide different tests with Ashton Gate certainly seeming on paper at least, to be the tougher of the two, though only time will tell if it works out like that.</p>
      <p>Their form is good and will come into the game on the back of winning away at Cardiff, so they’ll be in great mood and it’ll be a hostile atmosphere at the Gate with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> needing their sold-out away following to be in good voice.</p>

      <p>Lamouchi and his players should be confident, after all, their away form this season has been brilliant with Wigan the only blot on the copybook in the league on the road.</p>
      <p>It’s vital that the head coach gets a better response from his players this time around, compared with the performance after the last break at Wigan and then Hull.</p>
      <p>To their credit, Forest have responded well to those two setbacks.</p>

      <p>You’re going to lose games at this level, so it’s about how you respond to those setbacks and you can ask no more than winning the next two – and one was against Derby so that shows the character in the squad.</p>
      <p>If you believe you can reach the sky, then there’s a great chance that you will - and by winning at Bristol, you have the chance of putting distance between you and a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/brice-samba-reveals-nottingham-forest-3547559">promotion</a> rival on their own patch which is big - just don't lose it.</p>
      <p>Get six points on the road and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-neil-harris-regret-3550364">return home to face Cardiff the following week</a> and keep that points tally ticking over.</p>
