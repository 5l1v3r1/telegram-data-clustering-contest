      <p>Announced earlier in the year at E3 2019, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/news/lg-claims-its-ultra-fast-lg-ultragear-monitor-is-a-gamers-dream-come-true">LG's UltraGear monitor range</a> made a big splash by being the world's first IPS monitors with 1ms response time, making them ideal for gamers who want both excellent colours and zero ghosting.</p>
      <p>Today, LG announced that it will be bringing a total of six new UltraGear monitors to Australian stores starting this week, with three monitors boasting Nvidia G-Sync certification and three more that offer G-Sync 'compatibility'.</p>
