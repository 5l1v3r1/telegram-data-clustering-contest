      <p>1Limburg, as well as other Dutch news sources, are confirming that Frans Verstappen, who is Jos Verstappen's father, died of cancer in a hospice at the age of 72.</p>
      <p>Frans was reportedly admitted earlier in November.</p>
      <p>Jos, Max and Frans had a difficult relationship. In 2016, Frans even accused Jos, a former Formula 1 driver, of assault.</p>
      <p>However, Frans remained a strong supporter of his grandson, telling 1Limburg earlier this year that the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/"><b>Red Bull</b></a>-Honda driver's success gives him "goosebumps".</p>
      <p>His death comes just days after Verstappen, 22, won at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>"Joy and sorrow are often close together," Max said in a brief statement read out by the broadcaster Ziggo Sport.</p>
      <p>Jos cancelled a scheduled appearance on the same network on Monday.</p>
      <p>Frans Verstappen reportedly owned an ice-cream parlour in Montfort, where he lived and where Jos was born. He regularly organised parties at a local club with a big screen to watch Max's races.</p>
      <p>A source said Frans Verstappen will be cremated on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Jos' ex-wife Kelly van der Waal said: "After a fantastic F1 weekend, the world pauses for the death of grandpa Verstappen."</p>
