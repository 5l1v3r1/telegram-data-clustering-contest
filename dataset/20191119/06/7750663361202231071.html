      <p>Currently, the Dutch driver and Brazil GP winner is committed only for 2020, when manager Raymond Vermeulen said the team must charge for the title.</p>
      <p>"It was a very good weekend, with excellent strategic decisions, and Honda - it all fit," he told the Dutch publication Formule 1.</p>
      <p>"If you want to be world champion, this must be the level, and it must be the level every time. Because if Max has the package, this is Max's level."</p>
      <p>Vermeulen, who alongside Max's father Jos manages the 22-year-old, said Verstappen is in the Red Bull simulator this week, working on the 2020 car "and laterally also for 2021".</p>
      <p>"So it's an ongoing process."</p>
      <p>As for the process of negotiating a new contract for 2021, and rumours that Mercedes or <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> might be interested, Vermeulen admitted there is movement in this area.</p>
      <p>"No, no," he answered when asked if Dr <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/helmut-marko/"><b>Helmut Marko</b></a> is now pressing for a 2021 deal.</p>
      <p>"But we have contact. Myself or Jos are always there and we keep in touch.</p>
      <p>"The team is under pressure as it wants to go for the title next year, and that is the most important thing for now," Vermeulen said.</p>
      <p>"Next year is the moment of truth."</p>
