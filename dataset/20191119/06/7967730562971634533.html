      <h1>Kurz will face pressure to cull Victory midfielders if rut runs on</h1>

      <p>Melbourne Victory coach Marco Kurz could come under pressure to dump some of his underperforming imports during the January transfer window and find new faces to bring much-needed creativity to his struggling team's midfield.</p>
      <p>Kurz took over at Victory in late June, and has in part been responsible for the acquisition of the four visa signings this season – midfielders Jakob Poulsen, Migjen Basha and Kristijan Dobras, and defender Tim Hoogland.</p>

      <p>Ola Toivonen, the club captain and Swedish international, was already there.</p>
      <p>Hoogland has yet to play a game, having being injured on the eve of the season opener against Melbourne City, so no blame can be sheeted back to the German centre-back.</p>
      <p>But Danish international Poulsen, Swiss-born Basha and Austrian Dobras have been involved to a greater or lesser extent in the six games that Victory have played, the results of which have been worse than expected.</p>

      <p>The traditional powerhouse has garnered only six points out of a possible 18 and lie eighth on the 11 -team league table.</p>
      <p>Toivonen is still scoring goals, but there is little invention from a midfield which appears too stolid and lacking in imagination.</p>
      <p>And without Hoogland, Victory look vulnerable at the back, with the team having conceded eight goals, only three of the 11 clubs shipping more.</p>
      <p>''Marco has had a difficult time with injuries but there are likely to be some questions soon about possible moves in the January transfer window if things don't pick up,'' said one club source.</p>
      <p>''We are playing solid, slow, dull football at the moment.''</p>
      <p>Given that most quality Australian players are under contract to rival A-League clubs, that might mean having to jettison some of the foreigners to make way for others.</p>
      <p>Recruitment at Victory is overseen by a number of individuals; the coach has the final say, but input is gained from football manager Paul Trimboli. For marquee signings the board, along with chief executive Trent Jacobs, can get involved.</p>
      <p>In his defence, Kurz was in a difficult position when he moved to Victory, having helmed Adelaide for the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>Quality midfielders Carl Valeri (retired), James Troisi and Terry Antonis, along with striker Kosta Barbarous (out of contract) had moved on, as did marquee player Keisuke Honda, leaving him with a dearth of experience and know-how in that area save for veteran Leigh Broxham.</p>

      <p>Poulsen has had an excellent career at higher levels than the A-League , but there was always little upside about signing a 36-year-old who had never played in this country.</p>
      <p>Basha, who turns 33 in January, also had an excellent CV, having played in Italy's Serie A for a decade and then last season for Greek Super League club Aris Salonika.</p>
      <p>He only arrived at the start of the season, and has done enough as a holding midfielder to escape serious censure.</p>
      <p>Dobras has a been under more scrutiny. Visa players are supposed to make the difference to an A-League squad, but last weekend, when Kurz was juggling a line-up that was badly depleted by injury and suspension, the 27-year-old attacking midfielder could not even force his way into the starting XI for the Big Blue against Sydney.</p>
      <p>Kurz has asked for patience, and there is no doubt that he will be given time to turn things round, particularly as he has had to juggle personnel problems.</p>
      <p>He has not had his best defender Hoogland – whom he would have built his defence around – at all, while Robbie Kruse, the marquee striker, has only appeared off the bench once this season, against Sydney.</p>
      <p>Socceroo frontman Andrew Nabbout is also out injured.</p>
      <p>There is every chance that Victory could put it together when it gets all those players back to full fitness.</p>
      <p>But whether even that could help them climb the table without an injection of flair from elsewhere is a good question.</p>
