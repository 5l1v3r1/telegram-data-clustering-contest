      <h2>A business boss has praised the global success of Black County firms - and said the region should stop downplaying itself.</h2>

      <p>Corin Crane, chief executive of the Black Country Chamber of Commerce, was speaking ahead of the organisation's annual awards ceremony.</p>
      <p>The region's Business of the Year, as well as Business Person of the Year, were among the accolades handed out.</p>
      <p>Mr Crane said: "We have got these global businesses and everyone downplays the success of their stories.</p>
      <p>"I have been chatting to them, and I hear 'oh yeah, we have just started training in Dubai', and 'we have started selling things in Australia', and 'we have just moved into the Middle East'.</p>
      <p>"And these businesses trade all over the world but we are not very good at talking about ourselves.</p>
      <p>"I tell you what, we have got about 60 odd finalists tonight, and each of those has got the story, and the employees, and the growth, and the pride they have in it, so there is going to be a few broken hearts tonight, and a few happy people as well I hope."</p>
      <p>Hundreds of people from businesses across the Black Country packed into Wolverhampton Racecourse for the annual black tie event.</p>
      <p>A total of thirteen awards were handed out on the night, which recognised a range of achievements from excellent customer service to profits and growth.</p>
      <p>There was more good news as Â£6,000 was raised for the event's charity partner Acorns Hospice.</p>
