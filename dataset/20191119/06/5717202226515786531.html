      <p>The Mail reports that Spurs are already making plans for when Pochettino’s exit does happen. The report notes that a source inside the club has suggested that it would be impossible for the Argentinian to see out the season.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen if Pochettino is that close to the brink – the Mail notes that Saturday’s clash with West Ham is not seen as make or break. But it is arguably an ominous sign that replacements are being considered.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699319/Time-running-Mauricio-Pochettino-just-matter-leaves-Tottenham.html">The Mail suggests</a> that Eddie Howe, Julian Nagelsmann and Ancelotti find themselves on Tottenham’s radar. It is noted that any of the three men would cost a significant amount of compensation given that they are all in top flight jobs currently.</p>

      <h3>TBR View – Ancelotti could be an inspired appointment in the short-term</h3>
      <p>Replacing Pochettino is not going to be easy. He has enjoyed a fantastic tenure and arguably deserves to be remembered as one of the club’s most important managers of all-time.</p>
      <p>If given time, Howe or Nagelsmann could be brilliant options. They have attracted the kind of plaudits that Pochettino got while he was at Southampton. So it is not difficult to see why Daniel Levy may be tempted by them.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti may not be the long-term answer for Spurs. He has not spent two years at a club since leaving AC Milan in 2009. However, his record suggests that he could make an immediate impact.</p>
      <p>The Italian has won Serie A, the Premier League, the Bundesliga and three Champions League titles. He delivered when Real Madrid were desperately craving La Decima.</p>
      <p>He may not be a manager who would necessarily stick around for a long time. But perhaps he could get Tottenham back on track.</p>
