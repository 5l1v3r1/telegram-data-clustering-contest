      <h1>Leinster look back to 'huge lesson' learned in Toulouse last season</h1>
      <h2>The Top14 leaders look set to deliver a statement of intent in front of their home support.</h2>

      <p>THEY WENT OVER as European champions. The fourth star fresh on their chest and  they were bullishly going in search of a fifth with a brilliant young lock who had not yet lost a match with his province.</p>
      <p>Losing always leaves a lasting sting with Leinster. Even if it was just a bounce to the wrong side of a thrilling, tight contest away to a rejuvenated giant of French rugby – a team who they went on to beat twice later in the campaign.</p>

      <p>13 months on from the memorable October 28-27 loss in Toulouse, the eastern province are using it as a stick to beat themselves with to rouse a performance in Lyon.</p>
      <p>The Rhone club certainly don’t have the European pedigree of Toulouse and began their Champions Cup campaign with a loss away to Northampton. However, they do have a perch at the summit of the early Top14 table with six wins from seven and a grizzled, powerful pack to set a platform for a dangerous back-line.</p>
      <p>Moving on from a staccato bonus point win over Benetton, Leinster are intent on displaying a little nous picked up in Toulouse when they meet the current Top14 leaders.</p>
      <p>“It’s a huge, huge lesson and a huge experience for everyone that was involved,” says backs coach Felipe Contepomi.</p>
      <p>“Going to play an in-form French team. It’s a good lesson. Hopefully, we learned from it and we’ll only learn if we do it right.</p>
      <p>“I’ll tell you on Monday if we’ve learned from it.”</p>
      <p>The Argentine takes exception when it’s suggested that Lyon’s performance in the weekend loss in Northampton featured a touch of disinterest.</p>
      <p>“If a French team are disinterested they will concede 50 points,” says Contepomi.</p>
      <p>“I would be say that they were caught out, surprised by the intensity of a European game. But they came back out from the dressing room, changed (the way they set up) and could even have got even closer (on the scoreboard).”</p>

      <p>The former out-half is highly respectful of Lyon’s ambitious style and of head coach Pierre Mignoni. The former scrum-half will surely have taken mental notes during his time working under Joe Schmidt and Vern Cotter with Clermont before going on to play alongside Contepomi in Toulon.</p>

      <p>“He has always been very studious of the game. My opinion is that he’s got a great rugby philosophy.</p>
      <p>“He is a hard worker, a very good coach, and you could see he was always going to be a coach, a good one.”</p>
      <p>“I think he’s very studious and he is pragmatic, at the same time keen on taking risk, having that offensive play, wide play, trying to impose their rhythm.”</p>
      <p>Precisely the sort of variety that stretched Leinster just that little bit too far at this stage last season.</p>
