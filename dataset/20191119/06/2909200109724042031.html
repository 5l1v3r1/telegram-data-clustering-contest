      <p>Chairman of the National Peace Council, Most Rev. Prof Emmanuel Asante has said the growing voices advocating for a “NO” vote in the upcoming referendum of December 17 must send a clear signal to the political class that their work leaves much to be desired by the populace, <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> reports.</p>
      <p>“Those who are saying NO; the indictment on the political parties they have not as yet looked at it. The people who are kicking against it are simply saying what we see at the national level is disgusting; the way you are doing your politics at the national level is disgusting to us, so we would better keep the little neutrality we have left at the district level; if they want it at the district level, one day they will reject it for the national level too”, he said in an interview on Kumasi-based Angel FM monitored by MyNewsGh.com on Monday.</p>
      <p>He however urged Ghanaians to shun the “hypocrisy” and accept the fact that, there is already vigorous political party involvement at the local government level.</p>
      <p>Prof Asante who said he was espousing his personal views on the matter and not expressing the position of the National Peace Council said, politicians must take a cursory look at the way they do their work, because all indications suggest that the populace is not enthused by what they see them to be doing.</p>
      <p>Public opinion has divided on the issue, with a seeming majority vouching for a NO vote, based on discussions and phone-in sections monitored on the airwaves by this portal in the Ashanti and bono regions.</p>
      <p>The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) at press conference last week urged Ghanaians to vote NO, citing political polarization at the localities as some of its reasons; but the government and its New Patriotic Party (NPP) are advancing a spirited campaign for a YES vote.</p>
      <p>This entrenched provision of the 1992 constitution can only be varied if 40% eligible voters show up and 75% vote ‘YES’ in favour of the amendment.</p>
      <p>If ‘YES’ wins, political parties would have the opportunity to sponsor candidates for election into offices of  Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executive (MMDCEs) and Assembly members.</p>
