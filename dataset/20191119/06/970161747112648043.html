      <p>In the years to come, we’ll all be able to get a full health check every time we visit the crapper.</p>
      <p>That’s if an innovative concept toilet ever becomes reality.</p>
      <p>To mark World Toilet Day 2019, toilet hygine brand <a href="http://www.bloo.com/en/home.cky.html">Bloo</a> commissioned futurist James Wallman to produce a 30-page report on what our future lavatories may look like.</p>
      <p>The result is far from just a waste disposal device – it’s a fully-fledged health monitoring apparatus complete with holographic display. Naturally, the toilet will be able to analyse the contents of the bowl and check things like vitamin and sugar levels as well as the quality of their diet.</p>
      <p>The toilet seat will be able to check heart pulse rates and blood pressure from the electrical and mechanical of the heart taken from the seat itself.</p>

      <p>Dubbed ‘Dr. Loo’, this toilet-from-the-future will also have built-in voice recognition. So you can sit there and have a nice conversation with it all about the state of your health.</p>
      <p>The unveiling coincides with Bloo launching ProNature, the brand new toilet rim block range, made with a 100% recyclable plastic basket, as the company pledges to a more sustainable future.</p>

      <p>‘The 2050 research and report reveals the toilet will offer the ultimate tech-enabled personalised experienced,’ explained Wallman.</p>
      <p>‘With the average consumer currently spending on average three years in a lifetime on the toilet, this will increase by 2050, following the toilet being essential to improve life longevity.’</p>
      <p>He’s not wrong about that – the average person visits the toilet six to eight times a day. Over the course of a lifetime, that amounts to about three years spent on the morning constitutional.</p>
      <p>‘With GPs being pressed for time, the ‘MOT Health Check Toilet’ will help give a whole new meaning to people ‘paying a visit’,’ Wallman continued.</p>

      <p>‘Although people will still need to visit their doctors, it will save hours of time, as toilets will soon give health updates from checking people’s temperature to their sugar levels.</p>
      <p>‘This is all from the comfort of their toilet making it the best seat in the house.’</p>
