        <b>The CoOp in Lostock Hall and Bamber Bridge is celebrating becoming the new champion of three good causes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lostock Hall food store and Bamber Bridge funeralcare branch will join forces to raise money over the next year for their Local Community Fund.</p>
      <p>Each time CoOp members make a purchase, the brand will put 1% into the fund, which will be split by Lostock Hall Juniors Football Club, Walton-le-Dale Recreation Society and Cuerden Valley Park Trust.</p>
      <p>CoOp picked these three causes as part of its focus on supporting community spaces, well-being and skill development in its 2022 community strategy.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Evans, member pioneer for Penwortham, Lostock Hall and Bamber Bridge, said: "Colleagues from FuneralCare and Food are so pleased to work with CoOp members to encourage them to choose the local cause they want their 1% reward from CoOp to go to. We appreciate how vital these funds are to support local community work."</p>
      <p>The two branches collected more than Â£11,000 for previous local causes between November 2018 and last October. Staff will celebrate with in-store events on Saturday.</p>
