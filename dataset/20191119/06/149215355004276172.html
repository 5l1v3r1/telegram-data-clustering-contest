      <h1>Diplomat who overheard Sondland's call to Trump said he's 'never seen anything' like it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:28:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/catherine-garcia" target="_blank">Catherine Garcia</a></address>
      <p>During his closed-door testimony to House impeachment investigators last week, David Holmes, a counselor in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, said hearing U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland call President Trump from the middle of a Kyiv restaurant was "an extremely distinctive experience in my foreign service career."</p>
      <p>The House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/david-hale-holmes-transcripts-released/index.html">released the Holmes transcript Monday night,</a> and he is expected to attend a public impeachment hearing on Thursday. Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878193/-trump-sondland-overheard-discussing-investigations-diplomat-william-taylor-testifies">first discussed the overheard Trump-Sondland call</a> during his public testimony last week.</p>
      <p>The call took place July 26, one day after Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and requested he launch investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a baseless conspiracy theory about Ukraine meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Holmes said Sondland placed the call to Trump through a switchboard, and he overheard Trump ask if the Ukrainians were going to "do the investigation." Sondland responded, "He's gonna do it."</p>
      <p>Holmes testified that he was shocked by Sondland's brazenness. "I've never seen anything like this, someone calling the president from a mobile phone at a restaurant, and then having a conversation of this level of candor, colorful language," he said. "There's just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly." Holmes said most of the local mobile networks are "owned by Russian companies, or have significant stakes in those. We generally assume that mobile communications in Ukraine are being monitored."</p>
