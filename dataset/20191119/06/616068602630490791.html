      <p>Motley Crue are reportedly planning to reunite for a 2020 tour with Poison and Def Leppard.<br/><br/>Almost four years after Vince Neil and his bandmates signed a "cessation of touring agreement" insisting they would never hit the road again as they prepared for a final show in Los Angeles, all four rockers have signed off on a return.<br/><br/>Sources have confirmed the news to Rolling Stone, revealing specific dates and venues will be announced soon.<br/><br/>Bassist Nikki Sixx previously told Rolling Stone he and his bandmates could only hit the stage again if all four of them agreed to do it: "We could override our own contract."<br/><br/>But he added, "There are people in this band who will refuse to ever do it again, and you're talking to one of them. There is no amount of money that would ever make me do it again because I have such pride in how we're ending it.<br/><br/>"If anybody ever... would call any other band members and say, 'Hey, it's been 10 years, let's just do 10 shows. A million a pop', it could never happen unless all four band members agreed. And if we did agree, the way we've set it up... we'd have so much egg on our face."<br/><br/>But fans are not ready for Motley Crue to be gone for good - one devotee recently launched an online petition calling on Neil, Sixx, Mick Mars and Tommy Lee to officially regroup after the quartet hit the studio together in 2018 to work on new music for biopic The Dirt.<br/><br/>The bandmates and their rumored tourmates have yet to comment on the news. Def Leppard toured with Poison in 2017.</p>
