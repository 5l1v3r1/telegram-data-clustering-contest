      <h1>Competition for foldable smartphone market in China heating up</h1>

      <p>The competition in China's foldable smartphone market is heading up after Huawei officially released its first foldable model, Mate X, in China on November 15, one week after Samsung Electronics began selling its Galaxy Fold there on November 8.</p>
      <p>Initial sales of the Galaxy Fold in China have been successful, said market observers, noting that quotas of the model available for sale on a number of online platforms, including Samsung's own official website, JD.com, Tmall.com, as well as a flagship shop jointly operated by Suning and Samsung, were sold out on Double 11.</p>
      <p>Encouraged by brisk overseas sales, including in China, Samsung reportedly plans to ramp up by 10-fold its foldable smartphone production in 2020 as compared to those rolled out in 2019, the observers said.</p>
      <p>Huawei's Mate X comes behind its schedule as the vendor made a last-ditch effort to revamp the software configuration and hardware specifications for the model including its camera design prior to its scheduled launch, said the watchers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Xiaomi is applying for a number of patents for its forthcoming foldable model, known as Mix Alpha, which will come with an out-folding design and a five-lens camera, said the sources, citing information available at China's National Intellectual Property Administration (NIPA).</p>
