      <h1>Phil Parkinson decodes Will Grigg's body-language as striker struggles for form</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland frontman Will Grigg's commitment has been questioned by some fans, but Phil Parkinson says it's just a sign of frustration</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Phil Parkinson says Will Grigg's body-language is indicative of the striker's frustration at his lack of goals - not of a player who does not want to be at Sunderland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/will-grigg">Grigg</a> is a proven goalscorer at League One level but has endured a tough time since his big-money January move to Wearside, scoring just eight goals in 43 appearances in all competitions, five of which have come in 33 league outings.</p>
      <p>That poor record has seen him come under fire from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Black Cats</a> fans, some of whom have pointed to the Northern Ireland international's body-language as a sign that he is not committed to the cause.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> says that is not the case, insisting that Grigg's demeanour is a result of his struggles in front of goal and accepting that it is up to him to find a way to get the 28-year-old firing again.</p>
      <p>Asked about the perception among some fans that Grigg looks like he does not want to be here, Parkinson said: "I don't think it's that.</p>
      <p>"I think he is frustrated with himself and he feels that he hasn't lived up to expectations.</p>
      <p>"He is determined to make an impact here and I think sometimes, with his body-language, he doesn't give that impression but I can assure all supporters that he he cares deeply and he wants to do well.</p>
      <p>"We have to help him do that, creating chances more often throughout a 90 minute game.</p>
      <p>"I want to concentrate on the areas of the game in which he needs to have more impact over the 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>"We've gone through that and shown him some things that we need him to do more of in games, and the goals will come on the back of that, rather than just going out there thinking 'I've got to get a goal today'."</p>

      <p>Grigg is back in the Sunderland squad for tonight's FA Cup first-round replay at Gillingham after he missed last week's EFL Trophy defeat ata Scunthorpe United due to illness.</p>
      <p>"He got over his illness, he was back in on Friday, he trained Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and he has looked good," said Parkinson.</p>
      <p>"I think with Will, he has to make sure that his all-round game is good enough to stay in the team.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes, as a striker, when the goals don't come you have to make sure you don't forget to concentrate on the other areas of your game, your hold-up play, your challenging, making sure you make those runs in behind to make sure you play your part in the structure of the team."</p>
      <p>Sunderland's squad is severely stretched at present with international call-ups and injuries forcing Parkinson to include seven U23 players in his squad for the trip to Priestfield.</p>
      <p>Parkinson wants to progress in the competition, with a second round tie at home to either Doncaster Rovers or AFC Wimbledon awaiting the winner of tonight's game, but he knows the priority this season is to win promotion from League One.</p>
      <p>That task continues this weekend when third-placed Coventry City visit the Stadium of Light and, with the midweek trip to Gillingham representing a 600-mile round-trip, rather than travel back overnight by coach the Black Cats will be flying to the South East this morning and staying over after the game tonight in an effort to maximise their recovery time.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: "We're flying down this morning - and we have to thank the chairman for that - staying over after the game, and doing a recovery session in an effort to get the lads' sleep patterns back to where they need to be.</p>
      <p>"The flight down will not only benefit us going into the game, but also later in the week going into the Coventry game as well."</p>
