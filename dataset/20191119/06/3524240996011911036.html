      <p>The Nigerian Army has filed a preliminary objection to a suit filed by human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN), praying the court to stop the army’s <i>Operation Positive Identification</i>, which requires that all citizens must carry a means of identification to be able to move.</p>
      <p>At Falana’s instance, Justice Rilwan Aikawa of the Federal High Court in Lagos had on November 5 stopped the army from going ahead with its <i>Operation Positive Identification</i> pending the hearing and determination of the suit filed by Falana.</p>
      <p>At the resumed proceedings on Monday, counsel for the Nigerian Army, Mrs Olayemi Badewole, noted that the arny had filed a preliminary objection.</p>
      <p>Badewole said she further filed a motion dated November 14 seeking to regularise the preliminary objection and prayed the judge to allow the motion.</p>
      <p>Justice Aikawa granted the prayer.</p>
      <p>On his part, the Solicitor-General of the Federation, Mr  Dayo Apata (SAN), who represented the Attorney-General of the Federation, said he had filed and served all the necessary applications on Falana.</p>
      <p>Responding, Falana, who was represented in court by a lawyer from his office, E. E. Olawale, acknowledged receipt of the processes and prayed for an adjournment to be able to respond.</p>
      <p>As a result, Justice Aikawa adjourned the matter till November 28.</p>
