      <h1>Watch: Yuvraj Singh laughs uncontrollably as West Indies’ Chadwick Walton speaks Punjabi</h1>
      <h2>Yuvraj Singh has scored 20 runs in two innings playing for Maratha Arabians in the ongoing T10 league</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:17:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/yuvraj-singh/">Yuvraj Singh</a> is teaching his Maratha Arabians teammate Chadwick Walton to speak in Punjabi in the ongoing T10 League 2019. Yuvraj posted a video on his Instagram account while having a short conversation with Walton in the Punjabi. The former Indian cricketer could not control his laughter as the West Indies cricketer managed to copy him well.</p>

      <p>Yuvraj has played two matches in the tournament so far and has struggled to get a big score. The World Cup-winning cricketer got out after scoring six runs on his T10 league debut followed by a 14-run cameo against Qalandars on Sunday. The swashbuckling left-handed batsman showed glimpses of his brilliance by hitting two sixes in a row off Sultan Ahmed’s bowling before getting out in the next over.</p>

      <p>The 37-year-old missed out on Maratha Arabians’ game against Team Abu Dhabi on Monday due to back spasm. The all-rounder is confident of playing in the next game.</p>
      <p>“I had a back spasm today so I can’t really fight my body too much. I think mentally I am still young, but the body says take it easy, so hopefully I’ll be fit for the next game,” he told reporters on Monday.</p>
      <p>Yuvraj is hopeful of coaching in the future after playing two to three years of league cricket.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of leagues coming up in the next two to three years, so I am looking forward to playing a few of them. It’s good for me that I play for about two or three months, instead of playing the whole year. I am enjoying that for the next few years and then hopefully can get into coaching after practicing that side by side,” he added.</p>
