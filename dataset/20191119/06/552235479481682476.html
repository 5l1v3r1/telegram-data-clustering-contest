      <h1>Steve Clarke has unflinching faith Scotland fans will return for play-offs as he reveals Steven Naismith injury status</h1>
      <h2>The Scotland boss is upbeat for the future as he readies his side for Kazakhstan.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>When you’ve been to hell and back in the name of following Scottish misery around the world, what’s the worst that can happen from taking one last leap of faith?</p>
      <p>It’s hardly the kind of slogan <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> would want to front an advertising campaign ahead of next year’s play-offs for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>But it’s the reality with which the national manager is dealing as he plans ahead for one final trip to the last chance saloon of international football.</p>
      <p>They’ll not be at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hampden-park">Hampden</a> in any significant numbers tonight. It’s safe to say those diehards who do intend to brave the elements for this Group I rematch with Kazakhstan will be doing so just to make sure that this ordeal of a qualification campaign really has finally come to and end.</p>
      <p>But next March, Clarke believes they’ll be falling over one another once again in the hope of seeing 22 years of torture finally reach a happy ending.</p>
      <p>Which is why the man in charge hopes to pump some fuel back into the Tartan Army’s tank with a third straight victory tonight even though this is a match that matters to almost no-one.</p>

      <p>“The Tartan Army have levels of endurance and their ability to put up with the pain that the national team have put them through is amazing,” is how Clarke put it yesterday as he prepared for the prospect of seeing this group out in front of a half empty Hampden.</p>
      <p>“There’s no doubt it’ll help if we go into the play-offs on the back of three wins. It would be much better than going in on the back of two wins and a draw or a defeat.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got no doubt in mind that in March – and I know the nation and the mentality we have in this country – Hampden will be full or almost full. I have no doubt.</p>
      <p>“The fans will be with us. The fans are always with us. The 3000 fans who went to Cyprus were behind the team.</p>
      <p>“And I’m telling you that, come March, they’ll be there and right behind us again.”</p>
      <p>Clarke knows his major battle right now is against the apathy which has settled around his squad since this section began with a nightmarish defeat in Astana. From that moment this campaign was reduced to a monumental waste of everyone’s time.</p>
      <p>Everyone except Clarke that is.</p>
      <p>Since riding to the rescue in May the new manager has been in a race against the clock to get Scotland’s house in order in time for a Hail Mary shot next March.</p>
      <p>Tonight then, gives him one last look at the problems he has still to fix which is probably why he will not think twice about asking <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismth</a> to lead his line again tonight, even though the Hearts veteran is only just returning to fitness after hardly kicking a ball since the start of the season.</p>

      <p>Naismith won his 50th cap in Cyprus on Saturday and his presence there will have given Clarke great comfort as the 33-year-old looks by far and a way the obvious choice to lead his attack when it matters most of all.</p>
      <p>Asking him to go back to the well so soon again tonight seems like a no-brainer - even if Naismith’s employers might not necessarily agree.</p>
      <p>Clarke nodded: “Steven Naismith is fine. If I choose to start him, he is desperate to play. When you look at his experience, his 50 caps speak for themselves.</p>
      <p>“It’s 50 caps with a couple of long injury breaks in there as well, so it tells you how important he has been to previous managers.</p>
      <p>“He is important to me, he’s positive in the dressing room. He’s a clever play, a cute player and he can score a goal as well. So he is an important player for us going forward.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He’s got a little bit of nous and experience and he uses it well.”</p>
      <p>Hearts were in mouths at the weekend when the talisman of Tynecastle went down in obvious discomfort just moments before Clarke replaced him with Ollie McBurnie.</p>
      <p>But the manager went on: “He didn’t have an injury on Saturday. The substitution for Steven was always planned between 60 and 65 minutes. The fact he fell over just before he came off was unfortunate! He’s 100 percent fine.</p>
      <p>“He has to get more minutes tomorrow because he is fit and available to play. Obviously I want to respect all the clubs and I wouldn’t put a player at risk in terms of injury. But, fitness-wise, Steven is fine.</p>
      <p>“I had a chat with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/austin-macphee">Austin MacPhee</a> before the international break and he’s quite happy for me to manage the player as I see fit. If I felt Steven wasn’t fully fit, I wouldn’t risk him.</p>

      <p>It’s to Naismith’s credit that he is so determined to play his part again at a point in time when so many of Scotland’s players would appear to rather be anywhere else.</p>
      <p>The row over the refuseniks has been rumbling on since this squad was first announced all of which adds to the gloomy despondency around Clarke’s camp, now that the final 90 minutes of Group I have arrived here at last.</p>
      <p>With a bit of luck soon it will all be erased from the memory banks completely. But Clarke must hope that the lessons his players have learned will not be forgotten.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “All the 22 players I have here have been in previous camps. They should know what my mentality is and the message I am trying to get across.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of players here who have been in all the camps and hopefully in the next four months they don’t forget everything they have been told.</p>
      <p>“Whether we have two training sessions or three training sessions before the first play-off game, hopefully it’s just a little freshener</p>
      <p>“I’m going to have three training sessions to get them back on the bike and ready to go again. It’s not a lot but, on the back of what we’ve done previously, then I hope it will be enough.”</p>
