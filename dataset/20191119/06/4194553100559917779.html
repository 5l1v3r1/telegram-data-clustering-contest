      <h1>Brazil boss Tite makes interesting Fabinho claim considering he still doesn’t start Liverpool’s no.3</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:34:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Fabinho, in our opinion, is the best holding midfielder on the planet right now.</p>
      <p>His form this calendar year has been nothing short of sensational and he’s barely played a poor game.</p>
      <p>Many Reds think he’s been Liverpool’s Player of the Season so far, in fact.</p>
      <p>But oddly, he still doesn’t get in Tite’s Brazil side, much like Roberto Firmino didn’t for a very long time despite him doing the business at Anfield on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>Bobby is now an automatic starter for <i>El Selecao</i>, however, but Fabinho still plays second fiddle to Real Madrid’s Casemiro.</p>
      <p>Still, Tite’s latest comments suggest Fab may earn a more prominent role soon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Fabinho has built a positive growing. All the times he played, he played very well,” he told a news conference, cited in <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/brazil-fabinho-confidence-tite/1hf4oy7y2vao6167w55v2p4lys">Goal</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“And he brings confidence from his club to the Brazil national squad. In a natural way, and we can feel it. It’s not that you can only see it, you can feel it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Fabinho is playing his normal football in a role that he also has at Liverpool.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our Brazilian players, Alisson, Fabinho and Firmino, are the only ones with a match still left to play this international duty – alongside Gini Wijnaldum of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>At 1:30pm today, they face South Korea in Abu Dhabi, before jetting back to Merseyside so they can prepare for the weekend clash with Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>It’s not a long turnaround but hopefully just enough time for everyone to get tactically ready for the task of facing Roy Hodgson’s long-ball merchants.</p>
