      <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is meeting to consider the cause of a deadly engine failure on a Southwest Airlines flight last year.</p>
      <p>The incident killed a passenger who was blown partly out of the plane when a piece of the engine shattered the window next to her.</p>
      <p>The safety board met Tuesday in Washington.</p>
      <p>According to preliminary findings, a fan blade in one engine broke, starting a cascade of events that led to the engine blowing apart about 30,000 feet over Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Riordan, a 43-year-old banker and mother of two, died from her injuries. Pilots were able to land the plane without serious injury to other passengers.</p>
      <p>The incident led to more intensive inspections of fan blades on certain engines made by CFM International.</p>
