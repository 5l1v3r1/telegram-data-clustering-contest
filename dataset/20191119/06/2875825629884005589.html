      <h1>Felipe Contepomi says Leinster will lean on Toulouse experience in Lyon trip</h1>

      <p>Felipe Contepomi admits Leinster will lean on their Toulouse experience last year for Saturday's showdown in Lyon.</p>
      <p>The Blues showed up at the home of the famous Red and Blacks and lost a pulsating pool game by a point to a resurgent Toulouse.</p>
      <p>But after letting a strong start slip 12 months ago, the province return to France forewarned as they prepare to face current Top 14 pace-setters Lyon.</p>
      <p>"It’s a huge, huge lesson and a huge experience for everyone that was involved," said attack coach Contepomi.</p>
      <p>"For two reasons - first, because we were in a similar situation coming off a win, five points in the first round at home. </p>
      <p>"And going to play an in-form French side, it’s a good lesson. Hopefully, we learned from it - but we’ll only learn if we do it right.</p>
      <p>"I’ll tell you on Monday if we’ve learned from it."</p>

      <p>Apart from starring for Leinster in his playing heyday, Contepomi also got to experience French club rugby at Toulon and Stade Francais after leaving Dublin.</p>
      <p>So he deeply understands the different nature of dealing with the whole package on French soil - the positivity of the home side, the special cauldron-like atmosphere of the rugby-mad crowds.</p>
      <p>"It’s a French mentality," he said. "It’s the way they feel rugby - and not only the crowd. </p>
      <p>"It's the players, the way they’re expected to perform in front of their home people.</p>
      <p>"That’s what you have to avoid, giving them that belief and momentum that can change the game.</p>
      <p>"It’s 80 minutes of trying not to let their crowd get behind them. It kind of happens here when we play in the RDS. It’s massive for us and the guys, they feel it.</p>
      <p>"In French rugby, it’s typical. You have to avoid that momentum given by their crowd."</p>
      <p>Leinster are waiting on Tadhg Furlong (back) and Joe Tomane (hamstring), who missed last week's opening pool game against Benetton at the RDS, while Rory O'Loughlin is a doubt with a shoulder injury suffered in the 33-19 victory.</p>

      <p>Caelan Doris is expected to miss out after coming off with a head injury.</p>
      <p>Contepomi speaks of Lyon's "many threats", including Tuisova, Wisniewski, Couilloud, Pelissie and Nakataici.</p>
      <p>But he compares their progress to that of Clermont when he himself was in France, rather than his own Toulon side.</p>
      <p>"I think they're a bit more stable (than Toulon were)," said the Argentinean. </p>
      <p>"Toulon was up and down and it was a change of personnel every year - a few come and go. </p>
      <p>"In Lyon,  the players have been getting involved in the culture they want to develop over three or four years, developing something bigger that is improving steadily and every year getting better.</p>
      <p>"That's why they are where they are. It's not like they came from the blue. </p>
      <p>"They have been getting better in the last few years and improving inside in their domestic league and now I know they want to make that step in Europe."</p>
