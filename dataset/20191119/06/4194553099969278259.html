      <h1>LFC potential XI v Crystal Palace if Salah &amp; Robbo are injured</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:46:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Mo Salah and Andy Robertson are currently back at Melwood getting treatment on their respective injuries ahead of Crystal Palace v Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638">Echo</a> said both are a ‘doubt’ yesterday – and with the game in five days’ – it’s probably not looking promising.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp will not risk long-term issues with both for the Selhurst Park clash, especially considering our ridiculously busy upcoming schedule.</p>
      <p>As a result, he’s likely to use two understudies in James Milner at left-back and we’d presume, Divock Origi in the front-three.</p>
      <p>By including the Belgian, Sadio Mane will likely move to the right flank and allow Origi to start in Salah’s usual spot on the left, with Roberto Firmino leading the line.</p>
      <p>Other options include Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the wing, but Klopp has shown this term he uses Origi as his ‘first sub’ when it comes to the forwards.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Virgil van Dijk will partner Dejan Lovren at centre-back, despite Joe Gomez being fit – while Fabinho will anchor the midfield with Jordan Henderson and Gini Wijnaldum either side.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Liverpool’s likely XI:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alisson; Trent, Milner; VVD, Lovren; Fabinho, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Mane, Firmino, Origi</b>
      </p>
