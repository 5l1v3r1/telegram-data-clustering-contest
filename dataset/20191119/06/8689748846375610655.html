      <p>Kwaw Kese and Shatta Wale are not friends and this is something a child born today even knows.</p>
      <p>The pair, often considered the ‘craziest artists’ in the industry have been embroiled in a long feud which is characterized by dies on social media all the time.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Kwaw Kese was pelted with bottles whiles he was performing his hit song Dondo on stage at the Reign Concert which was held on October 20 at the Fantasy Dome In Accra.</p>
      <p>This happened because of the animosity between himself and Shatta Wale so it was even surprising that he came to the concert to support Wale in the first place.</p>
      <p>It seems both artists have put the issue behind them as they exchanged warm pleasantries at the just ended 4Syte Music Video Awards held at the Kempinski Hotel in Accra.</p>
      <p>Kwaw Kese walked over to where Wale was sitting and gave him a big hug and it was so heartwarming.</p>
