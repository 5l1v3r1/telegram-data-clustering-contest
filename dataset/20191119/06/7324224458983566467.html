      <h1>The ups and downs of life on loan from Wolves</h1>
      <h2>Wolves have 16 players out on loan – but how are they getting on?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:05:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Nine are still playing in this country, three are in Portugal, with one each out in Slovakia, Spain, Scotland and the Czech Republic respectively.</p>
      <p>Here, we look at how each of them have fared so far.</p>
      <h3>England – Ivan Cavaleiro (Fulham), Helder Costa (Leeds), Bright Enobakhare (Wigan), Rafa Mir (Nottingham Forest), Will Norris (Ipswich), Ryan Giles (Shrewsbury), Cameron John and Niall Ennis (Doncaster), Sadou Diallo (Accrington Stanley)</h3>
      <p>The loan departures of Cavaleiro and Costa were the most high-profile – and the former has come up with some impressive strikes for Fulham.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese winger has scored four times in 15 Championship games for the Cottagers, while Costa has had a few bright displays without scoring for Leeds in the same division.</p>
      <p>Wolves fans are hoping the pair do well, although neither are expected to return to Molineux.</p>
      <p>A permanent transfer for Cavaleiro to Fulham is thought to be on the cards while Leeds have already agreed to buy Costa for a fee of around £15million.</p>

      <p>Another forward, Enobakhare, is also in the Championship and it seemed, if he were to do well at Wigan, there was a slight chance of him getting back into the gold and black set-up.</p>
      <p>However, after starring at Coventry in the second half of last term, he has not played for Paul Cook’s side since August 20.</p>
      <p>Mir has made eight appearances – seven as a sub – and not scored for Forest.</p>
      <p>In League One, defender Cameron John started well at Doncaster but has been out of action since September after suffering an ankle injury in training.</p>
      <p>Ennis has picked up a couple of injuries for the same club.</p>
      <p>He has scored once, though, and Darren Moore said of him last month: “He gives you that out, Niall.</p>
      <p>“He’s strong, he’s quick, he manages and manipulates the ball really well with it at his feet. He gives the opposition defenders something to think about.”</p>
      <p>At Paul Lambert’s Ipswich, Will Norris has had to be patient for his opportunity between the sticks.</p>
      <p>He has started the last two games for them, managing to wrestle the No.1 shirt off Tomas Holy.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Young midfielder Sadou Diallo has only played once, as a sub, for Accrington.</p>
      <p>The player still in this country who has made the best case for a future first-team inclusion at Wolves is Ryan Giles.</p>
      <p>He was a regular for Sam Ricketts’ Shrewsbury until a recent knee knock – after making his Wolves bow against the same side last campaign.</p>
      <p>And Ricketts has backed him to make the grade at Molineux: “He certainly has the potential to do it, he has athleticism, the speed, the quality of his crossing in the final third is good – it could still improve – but it is good.</p>
      <p>“There are areas of his game to brush up on but he is keen and hungry to improve, which is the most important thing for any young player.</p>
      <p>“He has done well, really well for a young player, his first run of games in the league.</p>
      <p>“He’s a really exciting player, especially attacking in the final third.</p>
      <p>“I think that is his real bit of quality coming through in that area.</p>
      <p>“There is plenty he needs to brush up on.</p>
      <p>“He is making big strides, he’s been called up by England (at youth level).</p>
      <p>“He has played for them a number of times now. He has plenty to work on but he is a young player with big potential.”</p>
      <h3>Portugal – Leo Bonatini (Vitoria SC), Roderick Miranda (Famalicao), Renat Dadashov (Pacos de Ferreira)</h3>
      <p>Brazilian striker Bonatini may not be a part of the European journey at Wolves, but he is still playing in the Europa League with Vitoria.</p>

        <figcaption>Leo Bonatini has scored a couple for Vitoria (AMA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He has appeared three times in the competition and made six appearances in the league, scoring twice.</p>
      <p>Bonatini, of course, played a pivotal part in Wolves’ promotion to the Premier League a couple of seasons ago, and also involved in reaching the top flight was Miranda.</p>
      <p>And he has played three times for the league’s surprise package Famalicao, who are third after coming up from the second tier.</p>
      <p>Azerbaijan international Dadashov – signed in the summer from Estoril but loaned straight out – has played six games without scoring for Pacos de Ferreira.</p>
      <h3>Slovakia – Connor Ronan (Dunajska Streda)</h3>
      <p>Ronan is still enjoying life in Slovakia as a regular starter for Dunajska Streda.</p>
      <p>He has helped them to second in the league – six points off Slovan Bratislava, who Wolves have beaten twice in Europa League Group K.</p>

      <p>Ronan is also still in the Ireland U21 set-up.</p>
      <h3>Spain – Ryan Leak (Burgos)</h3>
      <p>After starring for the now-defunct Jumilla last campaign, defender Leak is now with Burgos in the Spanish third tier and has made five league appearances.</p>
      <h3>Scotland – Connor Johnson (Kilmarnock)</h3>
      <p>Former u23s captain Johnson, after spending last season with Walsall, has started once for Kilmarnock – a 2-1 loss to Motherwell at the end of last month.</p>
      <h3>Czech Republic – Christian Herc (Viktoria Plzen)</h3>
      <p>Viktoria Plzen are second in the Czech top flight but midfielder Herc has played no part in league proceedings, only making one cup appearance.</p>
