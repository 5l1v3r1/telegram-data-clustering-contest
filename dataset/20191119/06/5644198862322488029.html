      <p>Israeli transportation company Gett said it will end its New York City ride-hailing business Juno on Monday, citing "misguided regulations" enacted to combat city congestion earlier this year.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Israeli transportation company Gett said it will end its New York City ride-hailing business Juno on Monday, citing "misguided regulations" enacted to combat city congestion earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The company told Juno users on Monday its service would cease to operate that evening, directing riders instead to former competitor Lyft Inc , which it has struck a strategic partnership with. Beginning in 2020, users of the Gett taxi app will be able to request Lyft-operated rides.</p>

      <p>Gett and Lyft declined to provide financial details of their partnership.</p>
      <p>Gett said it would increasingly focus on the corporate transportation sector.</p>
      <p>The company faced growing pressure as regulation damaged ride volumes, making profitability a distant and difficult prospect.</p>
      <p>New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) last year implemented several laws challenging the way ride-share companies operate in North America's largest city, one of the industry's biggest markets.</p>
      <p>Since January, private ride-hailing trips below Manhattan's 96th Street are taxed at US$2.75, while shared rides are charged 75 cents. The charge must be passed on to passengers and cannot be taken out of drivers' pay, the law says.</p>
      <p>New rules also cap the number of app-based, for-hire cars and established minimum pay for the city's 80,000 ride-share drivers based on how much time they spend transporting passengers.</p>
      <p>Beginning next year, the law also limits time drivers spend "cruising" - driving to or waiting to pick up new passengers.</p>
      <p>Juno, which launched its NYC ride-hailing service in 2016, marketed itself as retaining happier drivers by taking a smaller commission from every ride. Gett acquired the company in 2017 for US$200 million.</p>
      <p>"Juno's closure in New York City is further evidence that the TLC's approach has created an uneven playing field that reduces choice for riders and drivers," Lyft said in a statement on Monday.</p>
      <p>Asked about the impact of NYC's regulation, Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told investors during a third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 4 that significant price increases were slowing down trip growth, but that the business overall was "quite resilient to the environment around it."</p>
