      <h1>Kate Middleton wins hearts again as she takes public transport to an event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:39:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Kate Middleton is winning hearts around the world, including the Queen of England’s, reportedly. The Duchess of Cambridge is poised, stylish, charitable, and she looks amazing in a tiara. But that doesn’t mean she’s above taking public transit.</p>
      <p>We can’t forget Prince William and Kate’s successful tour of Pakistan, where the Royal duo were seen even getting themselves out of a rickshaw for a special reception hosted by the British High Commissioner to Pakistan in Islamabad.</p>

      <p>Now back in her home country England, Kate traveled to Norfolk for the launch of The Nook children’s hospice, <i><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29810633/kate-middleton-public-transportation-engagement-norfolk/">InStyle</a></i>. While she ultimately arrived at the engagement itself by car (in a stunning berry pink skirt suit by Oscar de la Renta that she’s worn at least twice before), Kate traveled to Norfolk the same way most Londoners would, by train.</p>

      <p>Specifically, she was spotted disembarking a Wherry Lines train, according to footage shared by bystanders. The line, according to the Wherry Lines Twitter account, is supported by the Community Rail Partnership and runs from Norwich to Great Yarmouth and Norwich to Lowestoft.</p>
      <p>And, if you’ve ever wondered what pristine Oscar de la Renta looks like in a crowd of morning train commuters, here’s your answer.</p>

      <p>The engagement was one Kate has been working toward for half a decade. Five years ago, the Duchess helped launch a public appeal to fund the center, which supports children with life-threatening illnesses. She’s also a Royal patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices, the group behind the new $13 million facility.</p>
