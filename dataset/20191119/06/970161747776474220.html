      <p>Sir Elton John has opened up about his health battle after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>Sir Elton had a build up of fluid under his colon, which left him in excruciating pain and needing to wear a nappy on stage as he performed in Las Vegas in 2017.</p>
      <p>It was after his show in south America that he suffered from an infection and place in intensive care in hospital.</p>
      <p>In a new interview, the singer explains how he was ’24 hours from snuffing it’ and had to relearn how to walk as part of his recovery.</p>
      <p>He also joked that he was ‘like the Bionic Woman’ as he has had his tonsils, colon, and appendix removed.</p>
      <p>Elton explained: ‘I went to south America and played in Santiago and I came home, and I got to London and I was very ill. And I was rushed into hospital on intensive care.</p>

      <p>‘I picked up an awful bug from somewhere. And I was about 24 hours from snuffing it. We didn’t tell people that was going on at the time, so I had an annus horribilis as they say for half the year.</p>

      <p>‘I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick. All I could think about when I was lying in my hospital bed was “please don’t let me die, I want to see my children”, and luckily I survived it.</p>
      <p>‘Now I’m fine but there’s very few bits of me left. There’s no hair, there’s a pacemaker, there’s no tonsils, there’s no prostate, there’s no appendix, I’ve had kidney stones. I like the Bionic Woman.’</p>
      <p>The interview also covers his career and battle with alcoholism and addiction to drugs.</p>
      <p>‘I used to drink a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black every day,’ Elton revealed.</p>
      <p>‘I used to smoke joints and I was bulimic. I would go to sleep for three days, I hadn’t eaten, then I would go out and gorge myself and then throw it all up. It was a very lonely existence and I just thought, “am I gonna die or am I gonna live? What do you wanna do?”‘</p>
