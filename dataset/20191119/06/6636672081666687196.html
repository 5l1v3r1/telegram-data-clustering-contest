      <h1>Intel to regain crown; Sony grows the fastest</h1>

        <b>All of the top-15 companies are expected to have sales of at least $7.0 billion in this year, the same number of companies as in 2018.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Intel is expected to be back on top of the semiconductor league table in 2019, regaining the crown it lost in 2017, predicts IC Insights, while Sony is expected to be the only top 15 company to grow year.</p>
      <p>The top-15 worldwide semiconductor (IC and O-S-D—optoelectronic, sensor, and discrete) sales ranking for 2019 is shown in Figure 1.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In total, the top-15 semiconductor companies’ sales are forecast to drop by 15% in 2019 compared to 2018, two points lower than the expected total worldwide semiconductor industry decline of 13%.</p>
      <p>The three largest memory suppliers—Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron—are each forecast to register ≥29% year-over-year declines in 2018 with SK Hynix expected to log the biggest decline among the top-15 companies with a 38% plunge in sales this year.</p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 2, only three of the top-15 companies are forecast to register year-over-year growth in 2019—Sony, TSMC, and MediaTek.</p>
      <p>Moreover, six companies are expected to have double-digit sales declines this year, including four of the big memory suppliers (Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron, and Toshiba/Kioxia) as well as Nvidia and Qualcomm.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The largest move upward in the ranking is forecast to come from Sony, which is expected to move up four spots to the 11th position on the strength of extremely strong image sensor sales.  In contrast, NXP is expected to fall two places to 14th with a sales decline of 6% this year.</p>
      <p>Intel was the number one ranked semiconductor supplier in 1Q17 but lost its lead spot to Samsung in 2Q17.</p>
      <p>It also fell from the top spot in the full-year 2017 ranking, a position it had held since 1993.  With the strong surge in the DRAM and NAND flash markets in 2018, Samsung went from having 7% more total semiconductor sales than Intel in 2017 to having 12% more semiconductor sales than Intel in 2018.</p>
      <p>However, with a forecasted 34% drop in the memory market this year, Intel is once again expected to rank as the largest semiconductor supplier and have sales that are 26% larger than Samsung in 2019.</p>
      <p>The 2019 top-15 ranking includes one pure-play foundry (TSMC) and four fabless companies.  If TSMC is excluded from the top-15 ranking, China-based HiSilicon (Huawei) would move into the 15th position with forecasted 2019 sales of $7.5 billion, up 24% from 2018.</p>
