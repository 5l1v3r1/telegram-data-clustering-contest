      <p>Andrea Childs, from Klick Business Solution Limited, praised the camaraderie of staff after they were crowned the Black Country's <b>Business Of The Year.</b></p>
      <p>Ms Childs suffered a tragic loss when her 20-year-old daughter, Bethany Childs, who was a former employee, died from leukaemia in 2018.</p>
      <p>Holding back the tears, Ms Childs told the Express &amp; Star: "I am speechless to win this award. I am very proud of the team and the company.</p>
      <p>"I lost my daughter a year ago to leukaemia. All my colleagues rallied around me. To win two wards just shows their support. I am so proud of them."</p>
