      <p>Former General Secretary of the Christian Council of Ghana, Rev. Dr Kwabena Opuni Frimpong has urged government to defer the intended referendum of December 17, in which Ghanaians would be voting on whether or not political party participation should be allowed at the district level, <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> reports.</p>
      <p>According to him, the discord that has surrounded the whole process gives indications that, there should be broader consultations on the issues before the referendum would be held if necessary.</p>
      <p>“If the law and procedure will allow it, let’s wait a little bit and build consensus first; let’s sit down again, because to allow for MMDCEs to be elected is not the problem here; the problem is to do with the inclusion of political parties in the district level elections or otherwise; let’s sit down and think about it again”, he said in an interview on Accra-based Neat FM monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Presbyterian minister expressed worry over the seeming break in the front of the National House of Chiefs over this issue.</p>
      <p>“It is becoming dangerous now, because the institutions of calm, that front for the public good in such matters are becoming broken because of this yes/no issue, and it’s almost infiltrated the chieftaincy institution”.</p>
      <p>He said every Ghanaian must be concerned about the division at the National House of Chiefs, which must be an institution of calm but has been turned into an institution of discord, simply because of differences on this matter.</p>
      <p>He said the pitching of the two main political parties, the NDC and the NPP, vouching for a NO and YES vote respectively is not healthy for independent decisions by the populace because anyone who would publicly espouse either of the two option would be seen to be doing the bidding of one of those political parties.</p>
