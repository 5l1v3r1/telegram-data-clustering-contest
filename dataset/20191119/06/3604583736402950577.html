      <h1>Four more redundancies at MaxiTRANS site in Ballarat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jolyon Attwooll</a></address>
      <p>Four more workers have been made redundant from the MaxiTRANS site in Wendouree, union officials confirmed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It takes the number of casual and permanent staff that have been lost at the factory, which makes makes truck and trailer parts, to at least 70.</p>
      <p>As well as 16 shop-floor workers, four white-collar workers are also thought to have been made redundant.</p>
      <p>Around 50 casual staff have also lost their jobs at the site over the past two months.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Australian Manufacturers and Workers Union (AMWU) said the additional redundancies were not taken voluntarily.</p>
      <blockquote>The union hopes that this process is now complete and that MaxiTRANS can move into the new year providing a secure long term workplace for our members and the residents of the Ballarat area<cite>AMWU spokesperson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>A statement put out by AMWU organiser Matt Christie read:</p>
      <p>"The AMWU is aware of additional redundancies that took place at MaxiTrans last Friday (15/11).</p>
      <p>"In our discussions with the Company there was to be a total of 12 redundancies for staff covered by the AMWU Agreement. We now understand that there were 16 positions made redundant on top of the admin and casual staff.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>"While we believe that the majority of these positions were voluntary redundancies, it is unfortunate that the Company later chose to make some of these positions forced redundancies.</p>
      <p>"The union hopes that this process is now complete and that MaxiTRANS can move into the new year providing a secure long term workplace for our members and the residents of the Ballarat area."</p>
      <p>The company's managing director Dean Jenkins told <i>The Courier</i> that of the 16 shop-floor redundancies, 10 were voluntary and six were not.</p>
      <p>The first wave of redundancies, as well as a staff reshuffle, were announced at short notice earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The company, which has traditionally depended substantially on casual employment, no longer has anyone working on that basis at its Ballarat site.</p>
      <p>Staffing levels at the Ballarat site are now at their lowest levels for "a substantive period", Mr Jenkins said last week.</p>

      <p>One victim of the staff cuts who talked to <i>The Courier</i> criticised Mr Jenkins for a high level of executive pay, as well as other alleged production mistakes.</p>
      <p>Mr Jenkins defended his salary, saying it had not increased since he took the job in 2017.</p>
      <p>In the annual report, Mr Jenkins' base salary is reported as $690,594 for both years.</p>
      <p>With superannuation and other remuneration, Mr Jenkins earned a total of $902,610 in the 2017/18 financial year, which went down to $796,816 in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>The annual report also said the company is seeking to "mitigate the single point of reliance on the Ballarat manufacturing facility" with a new Queensland manufacturing facility "currently under development".</p>
      <p>This would it said reduce the long-term strain on Ballarat and allow MaxiTRANS "to better support the growing Northern NSW and Queensland markets".</p>
      <p>Mr Jenkins told <i>The Courier </i>production errors were possible given the scale of the manufacturing.</p>
      <p>"We do the right thing by our customers and our warranty support has got better not worse," he said.</p>
      <p>He reiterated that the wider background to the redundancies in Ballarat was a declining market, which he said was affecting businesses across the board.</p>
