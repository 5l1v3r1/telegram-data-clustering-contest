      <p>A section of Congress party workers picked up an argument with party leaders, here on Tuesday, alleging that photos of Muslim leaders were not carried in the posters and banners detailing the party programme scheduled for the day.</p>
      <p>The district unit of the party has organised Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary. Dr. Amshumanth Gowda, newly appointed president of the party’s district unit will take charge today. Many leaders including KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah, former minister D.K. Shivakumar are to participate.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the programme, the party took out a procession from Hanumanthappa Circle to Vokkaliga Bhavan. During the procession, a few workers raised their voice alleging that Muslim leaders of the party were being ignored in the programme.</p>
      <p>Their photos did not figure in the banners and posters of the programme, they said adding that the party needed the support of Muslims only during the election.</p>
      <p>Former district unit president M.L. Murthy and others tried to pacify the angry workers. The traffic movement was affected for a few minutes as the workers were engaged in arguments.</p>
