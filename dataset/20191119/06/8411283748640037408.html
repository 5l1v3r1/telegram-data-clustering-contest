      <h1>China handset ODMs making headway</h1>

      <p>First-tier Chinese handset ODMs including the Wingtech Group, Huaqin Telecom Technology and Longcheer have emerged as the leading group in the field thanks to the rise of China-based handset brands in the global market, according to industry observers.</p>
      <p>Buoyed by orders from China's handset vendors including Huawei and Xiaomi, these first-tier Chinese handset ODMs have gradually ramped up their production to economics of scale and marginalized other second-tier local rivals and those in Taiwan such as Arima Communications, said the observers.</p>
      <p>The marginalization of lesser makers is expected to intensify in 2020 as the global handset market further consolidates, dominated by a few of leading brands such as Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo and Apple, commented the observers.</p>
      <p>Wingtech's handset clients include Huawei, Xiaomi, Lenovo, Samsung Electronics and Asustek Computer. Wingtech has deepened its deployment in the 5G segment as it aims to continue to sustain 5G phone orders from these clients, indicated the sources.</p>
      <p>Being the sole handset ODM at a 5G end-market device alliance event held by China Mobile in Guangzhou recently, Wingtech is set to land massive 5G phone orders from the top Chinese telecom, said the sources.</p>
      <p>At the event, China Mobile said that it aims to secure 70 million 5G service subscribers and to sell up to 100 million 5G phones and 50 million smart home devices in 2020.</p>
      <p>In response to dwindling ODM orders, Arima Communications has minimized its operating scale by disposing its plants in China as well as a plant in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, said the sources.</p>
