      <p>Matt Doherty described as "sickening" Ireland's close call with Euro 2020 qualification last night.<br/><br/>Doherty was outstanding throughout, save from one crucial moment in the 73rd minute when he allowed Denmark's Martin Braithwaite to drift off his shoulder to force home the opener.<br/><br/>Twelve minutes later, it was the Wolves defender who struck at the back post when he met Enda Stevens' cross to restore parity.  But Ireland needed to win, and their lifeline expired at the final whistle. The 1-1 scoreline was enough for the jubilant visitors.<br/><br/>"Sickening, really, to be honest," admitted Doherty. "We played really well. We definitely deserved to win.<br/><br/>"It felt good, like everything was going to fall into place. But it just wasn't our night.<br/><br/>"They had one chance and managed to score and we looked like the better team. We played really good stuff.<br/><br/>"You want to stay in the game for as long as possible and then pile the pressure on at the end. Unfortunately we did that when we were 1-0 down.<br/><br/>"It was a bit of a mountain to climb and we didn’t do it.<br/><br/>"We probably didn't create anything clear cut but I think we were definitely in the ascendancy, the momentum was behind us.<br/><br/>"During the whole group we struggled to score an abundance of goals. We managed to get one not two so pretty sickened right now."<br/><br/>Ireland are definitely into a play-off series in March, but now have a one-legged semi-final and one-legged final to negotiate if they're to have the chance to play on home soil in the finals next summer.<br/><br/>The home dressing-room, not surprisingly, wasn't putting too much thought into the fixtures now to come.<br/><br/>"Aw, really flat," said Doherty, when asked to describe the players' feelings there afterwards.<br/><br/>"Not much said, really quiet, but we know we still have March to go so the heads won’t be down for long.<br/><br/>"Of course we know that March is to come. We were pretty confident to night and played out from the back, our shape was good, our movement was good.<br/><br/>"If everyone can stay in form and stay fit, then the play-offs should be good for us."</p>

      <p>Skipper Shane Duffy was massively disappointed and the totemic centre-half was quick to take the lion's share of the blame for the goal concession.<br/><br/>"It was just q lack of communication between me and Matt," said Duffy. "That’s football, we make mistakes together and we win together.<br/><br/>"The higher the level we go up you can’t make mistakes, you get punished. If you want to qualify for major tournaments it’s something we're going to have to learn from.<br/><br/>"That's the only slight little error we made and they punished us. He’s cut back in, he's not offside and here’s no pressure on the ball so I dropped to head to cross away.<br/><br/>"If I did play him onside, it’s my fault.<br/><br/>"We didn’t let them get their game going. They didn’t really cut us open but obviously we made a mistake."<br/><br/>Duffy believes that Ireland, once they get over their disappointment, will take encouragement from the display.<br/><br/>"It’s hard but you have to be positive, try to stick at it and not to be down but I’m disappointed because we didn’t win," he said. "We’re not out, though, so that’s a positive that we have to take.<br/><br/>"If we can take that performance in the play-offs now, we can beat any team". </p>
