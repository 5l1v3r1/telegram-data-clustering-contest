      <h1>Jack Ross admits 'Sunderland 'Til I Die' footage almost gave new Hibs boss second thoughts</h1>
      <h2>Ross took the job at the Stadium of Light between the first and second series of the Netflix documentary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Jack Ross will miss some things about managing Sunderland, but the new Hibs head coach is relieved not to have a camera crew following him about in his latest gig.</p>
      <p>Ross was sacked by the Wearside club five weeks ago, but didn’t have to wait long for his next job and was chosen as Paul Heckingbottom’s successor last week.</p>
      <p>The weight of expectation will still be there, but the scrutiny of a behind-the scenes camera crew following his every move won’t be something he has to contend with at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a>.</p>
      <p>Netflix’s “Sunderland ‘Til I Die” documentary went behind the scenes at the Stadium of Light, initially during the 2017/18 Championship season.</p>
      <p>Having just been relegated from the English Premier League, the expectation was that the Mackems' title challenge would be the focus, the hope being that a triumphant return to the top flight would provide a thrilling climax to the series.</p>
      <p>They ended up in a new division, just not the one they wanted. Simon Grayson then Chris Coleman oversaw a second successive relegation to English Football’s third tier ahead of a change of ownership (with a late-season cameo in the dugout from former Hibs assistant manager Robbie Stockdale).</p>
      <p>While the disaster that unfolded provided some great television (for Newcastle fans especially), it was hardly a ringing endorsement for any potential replacements for Coleman, who left when Sunderland’s relegation was confirmed.</p>
      <p>It’s therefore lucky that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> didn’t watch any of the first series before agreeing to take the top job after guiding St Mirren to promotion from the Scottish Championship.</p>
      <p>When he did finally see some footage, he could have been forgiven for having second thoughts.</p>
      <p>“When I first took the job, it wasn’t a certainty that there would be a second series,” he explained. “I said ‘no’, the board said ‘yes’. So the board won.</p>
      <p>“So, to try to convince me to help them with it, they showed me little bits of the first series. And for some reason they decided to show me the clip where Chris [Coleman] comes out the stadium after being relegated. I’ve no idea why they showed me that. The problem is: I had started the job already. If they had showed me that before I got it, I don’t know if I would have taken it!</p>

      <p>“I hadn’t even taken charge of a game at that point and was thinking: ‘Oh aye, this will be good’.”</p>
      <p>The second series follows’ the Black Cats during the 2018/19 campaign, which included two Wembley appearances.</p>
      <p>Set to be broadcast early next year, Ross admitted he was wary at first, but learned to live with having aspects of his day to day life coming under extra scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“I’ve managed to see some of the episodes of the next series,” he said. “When you make these documentaries there is probably a narrative before it is even produced.</p>
      <p>“It’s very well done - just like the first series, it’s very well produced. It’s probably less enjoyable when you are in it than when you are just watching!</p>
      <p>“That’s a different experience, that season of having a camera crew omnipresent and everything that goes with that. That’s done now and I’ve probably become less paranoid about that. If people judge me from how I appear on a TV programme rather than how I am first-hand, then so be it.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure everyone would be the same. A lot of people don’t like watching themselves back or listening to themselves. Well, if you extend that further and be part of something which is edited and put together, you can be unsure about what the storyline will be and how you will come across. </p>
      <p>“You can watch it and pick out little things, saying ‘am I happy with that?’ But, truth be told, you make peace with it. I’m sure people will enjoy watching it but it’s not something I’d love to be part of again. It didn’t give me a thirst for reality television, that’s for sure!”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Despite being accommodating when he could be, Ross revealed he had to draw the line somewhere when it came to what he was comfortable granting the film crew access to.</p>
      <p>He added: “There’s always some push and shove. Ideally, they wanted access to more than I was willing to give them and, as a caveat to that, I had to give up some of my own time for interviews and have camera crews in my car coming home from work. It’s very different.</p>
      <p>“The people involved in the production crew were very nice, it was just about explaining to them at times that it was nothing personal. It was about me trying to get on with my job as best as I could, while they were trying to make a television programme.</p>
      <p>“There was a continual desire for dressing room access or tactical meeting access. That’s why I was always firm in my stance that they wouldn’t get it.</p>
      <p>“Not because I thought I would change, but the perception from the players might. The message gets diluted. If there’s a camera crew present then maybe the players wonder if you believe what you are saying or whether it’s for effect.</p>
      <p>“I was very consistent in the access I allowed, and keeping the nuts and bolts of my work private.”</p>

      <p>Ross experienced the lows of losing at Wembley twice (The Checkatrade Trophy and Play-Off finals to Portsmouth and Charlton respectively), but insists he has no regrets from his time on the North East of England.</p>
      <p>“It was relentless and intense,” he explained. “We had 61 games last season and travelled a lot so that intense nature of it was significantly different than what I was used to before.</p>
      <p>“But it’s impossible not to enjoy leading teams out at Wembley or being in charge of a team that’s getting 30,000 fans every other week.</p>
      <p>“There were ups and downs, highs and lows, but taking the opportunity to be Sunderland manager is something I will never regret. It was a terrific all-round experience.”</p>
