      <h1>Bristol Rovers expected team to take on Bromley in FA Cup first round replay</h1>
      <h2>Graham Coughlan will be missing a number of headline names</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Rovers are under the lights and the glare of national television on Tuesday night as they look to avoid an FA Cup upset at the hands of National League high-flyers Bromley.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">The Gas weren't beaten</a> in the original tie but <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-rovers-bromley-bush-live-3521229">were given a bloody nose</a> having surrendered a 1-0 advantage at the Mem to draw a contest they were largely second-best and in which manager Graham Coughlan admits they simply didn't turn up.</p>
      <p>BT Sport's cameras are at Hayes Lane for the straightforward narrative of hopefully witnessing a non-league side beating a League One team and it should present a testing atmosphere for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bromleys-plastic-pitch-dramatically-impact-3550046">concerns in terms of injuries</a>, form plus tactical considerations, here is how we think Rovers will line up ...</p>
      <h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
      <p>Bristol Rovers could well have a player at Euro 2020 next summer after Anssi Jaakkola's Finland sealed their qualification on Friday following a 3-1 win over Liechtenstein.</p>
      <p>Jaakkola remains with the camp, as they played their final qualifier against Greece on Monday, and isn't due back in Bristol until Wednesday or Thursday so Jordi van Stappershoef will don the gloves at Hayes Lane.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Dutchman has filled in admirably in Jaakkola's sporadic absences and been Rovers first choice in the EFL Trophy so has now developed a strong understanding with his teammates, particularly in defence.</p>
      <p>It will be a big mental test for the 23-year-old, however, who has made four of his five appearances in the relatively comfortable confines of the Mem with his only experience outside of north Bristol being at a sparsely-populated Home Park.</p>
      <h3>Defence</h3>
      <p>Tom Davies' knee injury is taking longer than first anticipated to heal and the best-case scenario for the centre-back is that he'll be in contention for the trip tp Shrewsbury on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In his absence, Coughlan has flipped between a back four and three-man defence, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mark-little-glad-proper-club-3538036">with Mark Little</a> either on the right-hand side of a trio or as an orthodox right back.</p>
      <p>One major issue Rovers encountered in the first game against Bromley was how <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/we-fell-trap-graham-coughlan-3522781">crowded and congested it was in the centre of the field</a> - evoking memories of the diamond deployed at the start of the season - and everything suggests the National League side will try and do the same.</p>

        <figcaption>Mark Little on the ball for Bristol Rovers</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>To combat that, therefore, Coughlan may switch to wing-backs, giving the Gas an out-ball on the flanks.</p>
      <p>Should that be the case then expect Little to slot in alongside Tony Craig and Alfie Kilgour as a third centre-back. Little possesses the height and physicality to do so, plus enables Coughlan to select an attack-minded wing-back outside of him.</p>
      <h3>Wing-backs</h3>
      <p>As above, if Little plays as a centre-back that surely means Alex Rodman operates as wing back on his shoulder, providing width, pace and plenty of offensive skills.</p>
      <p>The only other option - which would be slightly rogue - is to select Rollin Menayese in the middle and then Little at wing-back but you feel it's the wrong set of circumstances for the 21-year-old to start his first game this season outside of the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>It's on the left where the real dilemma is, as Coughlan has flipped between Luke Leahy and Michael Kelly, while Tareiq Holmes-Dennis now also enters the equation as he made his return to the team against Swindon.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3453649.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JMP_Doncaster_Rovers_v_Bristol_Rovers_RS_123JPG.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>However, the latter is unlikely to be in the team at Hayes Lane due to the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bromleys-plastic-pitch-dramatically-impact-3550046">unforgiving nature of the 3G pitch</a> which could aggravate any injury and/or contribute to a new one, should he not be physically right. It just seems too much of a risk to play him.</p>
      <p>Given the manager wants Rovers to go and impose themselves on their opponents and play on the front foot, you feel that favours the more offensively-minded Leahy as opposed to Kelly, who's probably more a recognised left-back.</p>
      <p>Leahy can provide better delivery from out wide and is more confident receiving the ball and pushing higher up the field, which is what the Gas require.</p>
      <h3>Midfield</h3>
      <p>With Ollie Clarke's full recovery from a niggling hamstring injury not quite complete, you'd imagine this contest is too much of a risk to start the captain, based on the same logic as applied to Homes-Dennis.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, and considering the size of the Rovers squad, unless Coughlan has a youngster in mind, then it'll be the tried and trusted trio of Abu Ogogo, Ed Upson and Liam Sercombe.</p>
      <p>On form this season, that is Rovers best combination with plenty of experience and ability to keep hold of the ball and pass their way around Bromley's pressing traps.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Getting Sercombe into a more central area is also key as in the first game he too often received the ball out wide, in harmless areas, and then had to take a touch inside into traffic.</p>
      <p>Kyle Bennett was played in midfield against Swindon but didn't do <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/door-remains-open-bristol-rovers-3550171">nearly enough to justify inclusion</a> for this tie which is as far away from a Kyle Bennett type of game as you can get.</p>
      <h3>Attack</h3>
      <p>Jonson Clarke-Harris' inclusion, like Holmes-Dennis and Clarke, is likely to be determined by the playing surface and it's simply too soon since he returned from a calf strain to risk him.</p>
      <p>That leaves two from Tyler Smith, Victor Adeboyejo and Tom Nichols.</p>
      <p>Adeboyejo has the size and physicality to demand a place in the team. He can match-up against Bromley's centre-backs and also help out defensively on set-pieces.</p>
      <p>Starting Smith and Nichols together also looks a bit too similar and Adeboyejo +1 is a big-man, small-man combination that just has the better blend.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>But with neither in particularly good form - Smith's last goal was on September 17, Nichols on September 3 - it's a tough call for the manager to make.</p>
      <p>Especially regarding Nichols, whose <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/why-earth-bristol-rovers-tom-3448943">confidence is starting to ebb away</a> and in the spotlight of a live TV broadcast, it could be another unnecessary additional pressure on his shoulders. Then again, it could also work as a catalyst to help lift him out of his slump.</p>
      <p>But Smith's form doesn't exactly make him a strong candidate, either. He looked overmatched and isolated alongside Adeboyejo in the first encounter and maybe Nichols' knowhow might be the more considered option in these circumstances.</p>
      <p>That said, Smith did spend time at Barrow in the National League last season so it won't be a huge culture shock, despite his Premier League schooling, and you just feel the time is right to take Nichols out of the firing line a bit.</p>
