      <p>Catastrophic fire danger conditions have been declared for much of South Australia for Wednesday, with more than 100 schools closed and at-risk residents told to leave their homes.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast a maximum 42C for Adelaide, while the mercury is expected to reach 45C at Murray Bridge, 44C at Renmark, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Whyalla, and 43C at Port Pirie.</p>
      <p>Seven districts were declared catastrophic fire danger zones on Wednesday - including the Mount Lofty Ranges and Mid North near Adelaide - while two were rated 'extreme' and six 'severe'.</p>
      <p>In regions affected by catastrophic danger, national parks and reserves will be closed as well as schools with R1 or R2 bushfire risk ratings.</p>
      <p>The CFS advised people living near bushland in catastrophic fire ban districts to leave late Tuesday or early Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>They warned a bushfire could not be controlled in such conditions.</p>
      <p>A total fire ban will be in place across the state.</p>
      <p>Bureau of Meteorology acting supervising meteorologist Paul Lainio said several November heat records could fall on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Wednesday's forecast for Adelaide at this stage is 42C, just shy of West Terrace's hottest November day in 1962 on November 30 of 42.7C," he said.</p>
      <p>"Across South Australia, temperatures on Wednesday will peak 8-18C above average ahead of a cold front that's accompanied with strong winds.</p>
      <p>"Those towns that may break temperature records are in the south and west of the state and include Victor Harbor, Nuriootpa, Keith, Naracoorte, Murray Bridge and Robe and Lameroo."</p>
      <p>SES chief of staff Graeme Wynwood urged people to drink plenty of water and to avoid the heat of the day.</p>
      <p>"If you do need to go out, do so first thing in the morning or later in the day when it is usually much cooler," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Wynwood said older people were more prone to heat-related illnesses because their bodies may not adapt as well to change.</p>
      <p>"One of the most critical things people can do is to consider those who are most vulnerable to the heat and making sure they are coping," he said.</p>
      <p>"Identify family, friends and neighbours who are elderly or frail and check on them to make sure they are OK and using their fans and air conditioners."</p>
