      <h1>Pledge to set up help line for racial and religious bullying in school</h1>

      <p>Victorian students who believe they have been racially or religiously vilified in school will be able to dial a new Education Department hotline if they do not want to report their complaint to the school involved.</p>
      <p>The dedicated contact desk will also be set up to advise schools on how to better handle incidents of racial or religious vilification.</p>

      <p>This will include advice on alleged racial and religious bullying that occurs outside school grounds, including cyber-bullying.</p>
      <p>It will be set up in consultation with the Anti Defamation Commission, a Jewish community organisation.</p>
      <p>The Andrews government will establish the help desk after it reviewed two widely reported incidents of anti-Semitic bullying in Victorian state schools this year, in which the parents felt let down by the ways the schools dealt with their concerns.</p>
      <p>In one case, a 12-year-old boy from Cheltenham Secondary College was subjected to months of anti-Semitic bullying, including being photographed kissing another boy’s shoes under threat of being beaten up, and later being assaulted in the school locker area.</p>
      <p>In the other incident, a five-year-old student at Hawthorn West Primary School suffered weeks of anti-Semitic taunts such as being labelled a "Jewish cockroach", to the point that he began wetting himself.</p>
      <p>The boys have each left the schools concerned.</p>

      <p>Education Minister James Merlino said an inquiry into the incidents had shown that “the schools’ responses to reports of anti-Semitism fell short of community expectations”.</p>
      <p>“When anti-Semitism is reported, we all have a duty to take it seriously and act,” Mr Merlino said.</p>
      <p>“We have a responsibility to educate the Victorian community and to call out and address insidious and abhorrent anti-Semitism whenever it arises and that is exactly what we will do.”</p>
      <p>But the government has suppressed the release of a departmental report into the incidents, citing privacy concerns.</p>
      <p>Even the bullied boys’ parents have been denied copies of the report, prompting both families to express their disappointment in the review.</p>
      <p>“Our biggest concern is that the report completely excludes the victims and in so doing fails to address anti-Semitism in a meaningful way,” the parents of the five-year-old boy said.</p>
      <p>The mother of the 12-year-old boy said she was angry and disappointed that she had not been consulted about the final report.</p>
      <p>“I put my faith and trust in our round table meeting with James Merlino thinking that it was about our children, our families and the good we may be able to produce,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Merlino said the governmen's changes “will also ensure students of other religious, ethnic or cultural affiliations feel safer and more supported in our schools”.</p>
      <p>Other actions the government has committed to include establishing a new group made up of representatives from Jewish youth groups, the United Jewish Education Board and the Department of Education, to advise on ways to address ant-Semitism affecting Victorian students.</p>
      <p>The United Jewish Education Board and the Holocaust Centre will develop Holocaust teaching resources for year 9-10 history lessons.</p>
      <p>Primary and secondary school students will be taught key dates in the Jewish calendar, and given help to understand how social and political movements that are characterised by intolerance can emerge in societies.</p>
