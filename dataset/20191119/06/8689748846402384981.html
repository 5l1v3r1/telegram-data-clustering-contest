      <p>Maverick Ghanaian boxer, Braimah Kamoko, better known as Bukom Banku recently lighted up the studios of Okay FM during an interview.</p>
      <p>The boxer, who reportedly has three wives including a fetish priestess, brought along his new girlfriend who is 22-year old to the studios whiles he was being interviewed.</p>
      <p>When the show was about to end, Bukom Banku grabbed hold of his young girlfriend and kissed him passionately to the surprise of the guests in the studio.</p>
      <p>The famous boxer cum musician and comedian also talked about why he does not want to give Bastie Samir a rematch.</p>
      <p>According to Bukom Banku, having a rematch with Bastie only means he is welcoming an early death for himself or he’ll get stroke.</p>
      <p>Bukom Banku also mentioned that prior to his match with Bastie Samir, almost everyone present at the boxing arena wanted him to lose because he had never lost a match in his career; he hilariously said even the plastic water bottles in the arena were all supporting Bastie on the night.</p>
