      <p>Last night, Wright left viewers saddened - by admitting he cried for days following his omission from the England squad for Euro 1996.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ian said: "To be honest I just wanted to win the FA Cup and the League and then in the end I won the FA Cup a couple of times, won the Premier League and played for England.”</p>
      <p>But Ian added: “I couldn’t believe I got left out of (Euro) 96, I cried for days. He (Glenn Hoddle) took Robbie Fowler and Les Ferdinand who are obviously top players, unbelievable players but I was devastated.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Caitlyn said: “Ian, James and myself all some from a sports background so for me, I’m always intrigued by people who have achieved so much in sport and I want to hear their story.”</p>
      <p>Rugby union star James said: “I think everyone, especially the three of us appreciates what it took to get to the levels we did.  We have definitely got a common ground, it’s nice to share that and hear from two people I really admire.”</p>
