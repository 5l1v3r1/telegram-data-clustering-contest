      <h1>A 'major retailer' could finally be on its way to the Newcastle Great Park's struggling town centre</h1>
      <h2>Furious residents have waited years for shops and other amenities to open on the housing site</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Holland</a></address>
      <p>A ‘major retailer’ could finally be on the verge of moving into the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle Great Park’s </a>ailing town centre.</p>
      <p>The lack of long-awaited shops and other facilities at the giant housing development has provoked complaints from residents for years.</p>
      <p>But the development consortium behind the estate insists that the town centre is “progressing at pace” and have revealed that they are close to announcing a big new arrival.</p>
      <p>Last year, a pharmacy became the first business to take up a retail unit on the Great Park’s high street - leaving 18 units still empty.</p>

      <p>And, after more than a decade of waiting for the promised amenities, locals are sceptical of any talk of new businesses coming in.</p>
      <p>After it was announced last Friday that environmental activists would be taking their battle against plans for another 1,200 homes at the Great Park to the High Court, housebuilder Taylor Wimpey gave an update on the town centre.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: “The town centre is now progressing at pace and as of today we can confirm that we have signed an exclusivity agreement with a major retailer with further announcements and planning applications to follow.”</p>
      <p>Under an exclusivity agreement, the seller pledges to only negotiate with one prospective buyer for a certain period of time.</p>
      <p>In December last year, a Taylor Wimpey representative told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council’s</a> planning committee that the opening of a new supermarket on the Great Park was due to be announced “very early in 2019” and that the estate was “a high-quality place where people want to live and work”.</p>
      <p>But that announcement did not come to fruition as promised, and residents are doubtful that they will see work starting on new facilities anytime soon.</p>
      <p>John Atkinson, head of the Great Park Action Group, said: “The consortium can say whatever they like about progress, but the cold hard facts are that there are 18 empty units here and just the one pharmacy open.</p>
      <p>“All of the paperwork that has gone into getting planning permission for the new homes and schools must be 100,000 times more complicated than giving retailers an incentive to open a newsagents or a cafe in one of those units.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have a shop, we don’t have a pub. Based on past history over the last 10 years, we just don’t trust them anymore.”</p>
      <p>It was confirmed last week that the High Court will rule on whether the building of 1,200 homes and two schools on the Great Park can go ahead.</p>
      <p>Save Newcastle Wildlife have lodged a claim for a judicial review into <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council’s</a> decision to award planning permission for the latest phase of construction.</p>
