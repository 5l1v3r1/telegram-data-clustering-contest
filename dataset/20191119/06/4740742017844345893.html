      <h1>Launch of new Bristol music venue Strange Brew has been delayed</h1>
      <h2>It was due to open by the end of 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>The launch of a new music venue in Bristol has been pushed back until next year due to 'setbacks with progressing the building works'.</p>
      <p>Strange Brew was set to open in a disused industrial space underneath a multi-storey car park on Fairfax Street by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>However the team behind the multi-use site, Bristol-based event promoters Dirtytalk, said they have encountered 'some setbacks' which have pushed the planned opening date back to March 2020.</p>
      <p>In a statement published on Dirtytalk's <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page, they wrote: "We encountered some setbacks with progressing the building works, which led to us having to renegotiate our lease terms and generally caused delays.</p>

      <p>"We are happy to say that things are now back on track, with building work set to start in earnest in the New Year and aiming for opening in March.</p>
      <p>"For those of you who chose Crowdfunder rewards, we will be organising a Bristol-based collection day in December for you to collect your goodies (date to be announced soon) and for those of you who can't make it / who are outside of Bristol your rewards will be posted to you after this.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for bearing with us!"</p>
      <p>After Dirtytalk revealed their plans for a new venue, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/new-music-venue-built-disused-2938751">the target of £45,000 required to make the concept a reality was reached in June</a> with a week to spare.</p>

      <h3>About Strange Brew</h3>
      <p>Strange Brew will be a 330-capacity music venue and late night café-bar in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/broadmead">Broadmead</a>, near to SWX.</p>
      <p>Previously used for car hire and repair, it’s a large industrial-type space with two distinct areas which has been derelict for nine years.</p>
      <p>The spacious front room with large windows and a high ceiling will form the heart of the venue with a large café-bar, a stage and DJ booth, a seating area and dancefloor, and a small record shop.</p>
      <p>The smaller adjoining room will be used for occasional clubnights and art installations.</p>

      <p>Licensed until 3am on weekends and 1am in the week, Strange Brew will provide a very welcome boost to Bristol's night-time economy at a time when it desperately needs one.</p>
      <p>During the day, Strange Brew will serve a range of drinks and food, before turning into a bar in the evenings offering locally-sourced beers, wines, spirits and cocktails.</p>
      <p>Bristol-based brewery Wiper and True has been enlisted in designing and supplying the bar, with a range of exclusive ales available.</p>
      <p>Having been unused for nearly a decade, the space needs a lot of work.</p>
      <p>The total refurb and start-up costs are estimated to be £95,000 and the Dirtytalk team are putting in £50,000 of their own money.</p>
