      <h1>Denmark, Switzerland through to Euro 2020; Italy rout Armenia 9-1</h1>

      <p>PARIS: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Denmark">Denmark</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Switzerland">Switzerland</a> secured spots at Euro 2020 at the expense of the Republic of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ireland">Ireland</a> on Monday as Roberto Mancini's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Italy">Italy</a> completed a perfect qualifying campaign by scoring nine.</p>
      <p>Ireland needed to beat Denmark in Dublin to clinch qualification for next year's 24-team European Championship finals, but Matt Doherty's late header was only enough to earn Mick McCarthy's men a 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium.</p>
      <p>A closely-fought contest, low on technical quality, swung the visitors' way when the unmarked Martin Braithwaite stuck out a boot to divert a Henrik Dalsgaard cross into the net on 73 minutes.</p>
      <p>However, Ireland scored a late equaliser to draw 1-1 in Copenhagen in June and they repeated the feat here as Wolverhampton Wanderers right-back Doherty headed in an Enda Stevens cross with five minutes left.</p>

      <p>Needing to win, the home side then threw everything at their opponents in the dying moments, but Denmark held on to clinch second place in Group D behind Switzerland.</p>
      <p>"We had opportunities but I am not going to criticise the lads," McCarthy told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"They have been brilliant. We lost one game out of eight. I am very proud of them. We can beat anyone in the play-offs."</p>
      <p>The Danes, European champions in 1992, can now look forward to playing at home during the finals, with Copenhagen one of the 12 host cities chosen for the tournament.</p>
      <p>Switzerland secured top spot with a 6-1 away win against minnows Gibraltar as Cedric Itten scored twice. Skipper and Arsenal outcast Granit Xhaka netted their final goal.</p>
      <p>Italy had already wrapped up qualification from Group J but they saved their best for last, making it 10 wins from 10 by hammering <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Armenia">Armenia</a> 9-1 in Palermo with seven different scorers.</p>

      <p>Serie A top-scorer Ciro Immobile and Nicolo Zaniolo both scored braces, while Nicolo Barella and Alessio Romagnoli found the net before Chelsea midfielder Jorginho converted a penalty.</p>
      <p>Riccardo Orsolini came off the bench to score on his Italy debut and Federico Chiesa finished off the scoring after Edgar Babayan had pulled one back for Armenia.</p>
      <p>It was an 11th straight win in all for Mancini's side, with Italy scoring nine times in a game for the first time since beating the USA 9-0 at the London Olympics in 1948.</p>
      <p>"We had the right approach to the game and you don't score nine goals by chance," Mancini purred.</p>
      <p>"We need to improve various aspects of the game but for me it will be really difficult to leave some people at home when I select the squad for the finals. They would all deserve to be there."</p>

      <p>Having wrapped up a historic first qualification for a major tournament three days earlier, Finland lost 2-1 to Greece in Athens despite Norwich City striker Teemu Pukki giving them a first-half lead with his 10th goal in eight international games.</p>
      <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina finish fourth in the group despite a 3-0 win in Liechtenstein, but they will have another chance to qualify via the play-offs next March.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Group F winners Spain rounded out their qualifying campaign with a 5-0 destruction of Romania at a barely half-full Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Gerard Moreno scored twice after Napoli midfielder Fabian Ruiz opened the scoring. Adrian Rus put through his own net in first-half stoppage time and Real Sociedad striker Mikel Oyarzabal wrapped up the win amid reports the match was Robert Moreno's last as coach.</p>
      <p>Having already qualified as runners-up in the same group, Sweden defeated the Faroe Islands 3-0, while Norway, who go into the play-offs, won 2-1 in Malta.</p>
      <p>The final automatic qualifying berth will be decided on Tuesday as Wales host Hungary with the winner going through from Group E, while a draw in Cardiff could allow Slovakia to pip both of them by beating Azerbaijan.</p>
