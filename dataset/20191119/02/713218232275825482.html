      <h1>Dorrigo Agricultural Show 2019 starts Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:57:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:57</time> by <a rel="author">Vivian Hoskins</a></address>
      <p>Almost 12 months of hard work and planning are nearly over and the 108th Dorrigo Show will start on Friday.</p>
      <p>Two and a half days of competition, displays and feature events will highlight rural life in Australia as it really is.</p>
      <p>Yes, drought and bushfires will be a point of conversation but for most the weekend will be an opportunity to focus on fun things and interests nearer the heart.</p>
      <p>Show Society President, Sally Duckett, says early forecasts suggest the weather will be ideal for ring events and outdoor competition.</p>

      <p>"The theme for our 108th exhibition is <i>Our Youth, Our Future</i>," Sally said.</p>
      <p>"The Dorrigo Show committee recognises the importance of youth and the future of the Show Society and encourages all young people to take part in this year's show.</p>
      <p>"The student art section is especially for the kids, with all things crafty and there are special classes in the vegetable, flower, cooking, needlework, handicraft, jams, and photography sections.</p>
      <p>"So, young people get creative and try some fruit and veg art or a farm sculpture with some great prizes to win.</p>
      <p>"For sporty kids there are plenty of horse classes to enter including showjumping and show challenge and poultry; dairy and beef sections also have plenty of classes for the kids.</p>
      <p>"In particular the thrills of motor bike time trials are always an attraction for young riders and the ute challenge draws many slightly older competitors."</p>

      <p>A full run down of all show events and times is available at www.dorrigoshow.com, Dorrigo Show, Handi Reference Flyer.</p>
      <p>The main show days on November 23 and 24 will be preceded by a program of bull, steer and poddy riding on Friday November 22 beginning at 7pm.</p>
      <p>Show officials are inviting fans to come early and enjoy a delicious meal at the Cattlemen's Stall and a drink at the bar before the action starts.</p>
      <p>Competitors will face up to bulls from Matthew Doak Bucking Bulls, Bundarra.</p>
      <p>These will include 10 to 15 "mini" bulls for the under 16 years' events.</p>
      <p>Sally says the rodeo is part of the society's efforts to make each show bigger and better and to make it different and appealing to a wide range of people.</p>
      <p>"For information about the show check out what is happening on our website or Facebook page," Sally says.</p>
      <p>"The Show office will be open to accept entries from November 11, 9am to 5pm.</p>
      <p>"We encourage exhibitors to get their entries in as early as possible either at the office or through Show Day online.</p>
      <p>"We issue a warm invitation to everyone to come and enjoy attractions of a genuine country show."</p>
      <p>Among the highlights of Dorrigo Show are the woodchops with axemen and women from across north eastern NSW competing in underhand, standing block, tree felling and sawing events.</p>

      <p>A rare highlight for any country Australian show will be the "his and hers" crosscut sawing with men and women competition together in one of the toughest events in any wood chopping ring.</p>
      <p>In recent years the beef cattle sections have attracted stock representing as many as 15 breeds while horse classes will occupy the main arena for much of two days.</p>
      <p>Saturday night fireworks will be a high point of Saturday night at the show and other major events, including side shows, trade events and many other features will run as normal.</p>
