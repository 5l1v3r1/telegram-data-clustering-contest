      <p>Kardashian clan matriarch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kris-jenner">Kris Jenner</a> is 'running scared' that closely guarded family secrets will be spilled on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I’m A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>She fears her ex Caitlyn Jenner won't hold back in the Jungle.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old - credited for turning the Kardashians into one of the world's most famous families - has big concerns that the camp-mate will spill the beans, report <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10369188/kris-jenner-scared-caitlyn-spillfamily-secrets/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>Caitlyn hasn't taken long to talk about her daughters and life back home after jetting into Australia on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old has opened up about her transition to her fellow contestants and revealed all about her first "driving whilst female" experience.</p>

      <p>Now Kris is said to be “scared and horrified” that she will say too much in the Outback.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn is reported to have commanded a huge £500,000 fee to appear on the show - one of the biggest cheques ITV have ever written.</p>
      <p>Bosses want value for money and that could spell trouble for those back home.</p>

      <p>A source said: “Ever since Kris found out about Caitlyn’s massive fee she’s getting paid for the jungle, she’s been concerned Caitlyn is being paid to spill secrets about the family.</p>
      <p>“Kris doesn’t care what Caitlyn says about her or their marriage.</p>
      <p>"After all, she had her book and her TV show.</p>

      <p>"But she’s scared and horrified about Caitlyn damaging Kim or Kylie’s brands by telling camp-mates about their off-screen private lives.</p>
      <p>“Before Caitlyn left for Australia, she wished her good luck – and let her know she’d be watching to see what she says.</p>
      <p>“She’s worried that Caitlyn will get into a confrontation and have a row – then talk about how awful her life married into the Kardashian family was for sympathy.”</p>

      <p>Caitlyn has been talking about her transition.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40, I didn’t want to be an old chick, but this is the latter 80’s and I never felt like I fitted in anywhere, I was trying to figure myself out, running around town” she said.</p>
