      <h1>Rioli case unaffected by drug code changes</h1>

      <p>Changes to the WADA code to reduce penalties for athletes who test positive for illicit drugs will not affect the case of Willie Rioli.</p>
      <p>The changes, which had been several years in the drafting, will come into effect in 2021, and will see bans cut from four years to as little as four weeks for players with illicit drugs in their system on a match day.</p>

      <p>But Rioli, who allegedly tested positive for cannabis on the night of a game, was also cited for an alleged urine substitution violation. Rioli can only be punished for the incident that carries the heaviest penalty, which will be the urine substitution, as the charges are viewed as concurrent due to the timeline of events.</p>
      <p>This, and the fact that the code changes won't come into effect until 2021, mean Rioli's case will be unaffected by the changes.</p>

      <p>He is already serving a provisional suspension.</p>
      <p>The push for change came from the signatories to the code – world sport bodies, governments and national anti-doping agencies – who argued that overwhelmingly, athletes who tested positive to illicit drugs in competition had only minuscule amounts that could not improve performance. Invariably the drugs were taken earlier for recreational purposes and were not intended to improve performance.</p>
      <p>Under the change athletes face a mandatory three-month ban without the need for a lengthy and expensive hearing. It can be reduced to a four-week ban if the athlete agrees to an approved drug rehabilitation program.</p>
      <p>While WADA did not approve of athletes taking illicit drugs as it was deleterious for their health, the WADA</p>
      <p>The AFL said on Monday the changes were in line with the league's own approach,</p>
      <p>It has felt long mandatory bans were too punitive and inflexible and needed to take into account individual circumstances.</p>
