      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:10:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/hina-rohtaki/" target="_blank">Hina Rohtaki</a></address>
      <p>A KOLKATA-BASED agency will be making the tableau on <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Burail Jail for <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/republic-day-2018-live-updates-parade-asean-narendra-modi-rajpath-5039827/">Republic Day</a> parade in Delhi for a whopping Rs 20 lakh. The agency has been selected by the Chandigarh Administration, which will be presenting the concept before the Ministry of Defence at a meeting this week.</p>
      <p>As selectors had been saying that Chandigarh keeps on getting the concept of Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake most of the time, the administration thought of displaying the jail work. It is only after the presentation is selected that the city will get a chance to display its tableau in Delhi on January 26, 2020.</p>
      <p>Two firms had applied of which Kolkata-based Adland Publicity Private Limited gave the lowest bid of Rs 20 lakh. Another Delhi-based firm had applied which had asked Rs 22 lakh for the same.</p>
      <p>The tableau will showcase unique ventures of the model jail in an artistic and emotive form showing “empowerment of inmates without compromising on security and safety”.</p>
      <p>One of the key features that will be highlighted in the tableau is outlet Srijan where sale of jail-made products, including sweets and candles, is done to bring the creative side of the inmates.</p>
      <p>The authorities will also be showing how they have renamed the barracks on the names of inspirational figures who have stayed in jails but impacted society in a positive way. Officials say that renaming of barracks has been done “to remove the stigma of inmates who are otherwise called by a barrack number”.</p>
      <p>Another venture that will be highlighted in the tableau is model jail kitchen which supplies food to 100 anganwari centres in Chandigarh catering to approximate 5,000 children.</p>
      <p>Other ventures that will be highlighted are reformation and rehabilitation of jail inmates through vocational training like carpentry, scooter repair, stitching and snack making.</p>
      <p>As far as the payment to the agency is concerned, officials stated that 60 per cent of the total contract price will be paid after satisfactory completion and display of the tableau on January 26, 2020, and completion of the work. It was also specified that 5 per cent of the total contract value will be paid after the approval of concept and design of the tableau by Ministry of Defence.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five per cent of the total contract value will be released after completion of the work. The firm has the experience of making Republic Day tableau 68 times.</p>
      <p>It has been almost three years that Chandigarh’s tableau has not participated in the parade at Rajpath in Delhi on January 26.</p>
      <p>As per procedure, the best 25 themes from across the country, including states and ministries, showcasing India’s cultural diversity and military might are picked.</p>
      <p>So far, tableau of Chandigarh participated in the Republic Day function on four occasions. On two occasions, the theme was Rock Garden. In 2014, the tableau of Chandigarh depicting Rock Garden, a sculpture garden created by Nek Chand, participated in the parade after a gap of 13 years. Prior to that, all the proposals mooted by the administration failed to impress the national panel.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the Ministry of Defence had rejected both the themes — works of Le Corbusier and Rose Festival — proposed by the administration for its tableau. However, in 2016, the tableau highlighting Chandigarh’s architecture, elements of green and smart city took part in the parade. In 2017 again Chandigarh couldn’t participate as it failed to conceptualise a theme on time.</p>
      <p>Similar thing happened in 2018 and 2019 as the theme did not appeal to the committee.</p>
