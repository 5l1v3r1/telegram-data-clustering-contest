      <h1>Akansh Sen murder case: Court holds Harmehtab guilty, sentence today</h1>
      <h2>Harmehtab was convicted under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code by the court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:27:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/jagpreet-singh-sandhu/" target="_blank">Jagpreet Singh Sandhu</a></address>
      <p>AFTER 93 hearings and over two years of trial, the Additional District and Sessions Court of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> on Monday held Harmehtab Singh alias Farid guilty of murdering former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s nephew Akansh Sen, who was run over by a BMW car in Sector 9, Chandigarh, on the night of February 9, 2017.</p>
      <p>Harmehtab was convicted under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code by the court of ADJ Rajeev Goyal. Harmehtab is the grandson of the erstwhile PEPSU chief minister Gian Singh Rarewala. Another prime accused in the case, Balraj Singh Randhawa, the son of a former sarpanch of Fatehgarh Sahib, was declared PO (proclaimed offender) by the court in 2017.</p>
      <p>After lengthy arguments which continued for two years, Harmehtab’s brother Hartaj Singh Rarewala, who had been present in every hearing of the case from beginning, came in the morning to check the status of the case. He learnt that the case was to be decided in post-lunch session. The judge pronounced the final order just after the lunchtime.</p>
      <p>Soon after the order, Harmehtab’s brother was shocked. He had come to the court with his friend to furnish bail bonds for Harmehtab. Harmehtab’s brother kept standing outside the courtroom until Harmehtab was taken away by policemen.</p>
      <p>The convict will be produced in the court on Tuesday now for the pronouncement of sentence. After the final order, the complainant’s counsel Terminder Singh said that there was enough evidence against the accused, and the court relied on this evidence while convicting Harmehtab. The three eyewitnesses to the incident, Adamya Rathore (complainant), Rajan and Karamyog, have stated in the court how the accused run the BMW car over the victim, and escaped. The three witnesses had no reason to falsely implicate the accused in the case.</p>
      <p>Advocate Terminder Singh said that presence of the accused and witnesses at the spot was proved, and as per Dr S P Mondal, the tyre marks were found on Sen’s body.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Incident as per eyewitness Adamya Rathore</b>
      </p>
      <p>As per Rathore, Gagandeep Shera and Akansh were drinking at the Boom Box cafe in Sector 9 while he was working there. Then, around 3 am, all of them went to the residence of Deep Sidhu, who had invited them. Rathore stated that he, along with Akansh, Shera and Karanyog, went to Sidhu’s home where Randhawa and Farid had arrived.</p>
      <p>Rathore stated that before the night of the incident on February 9, Shera and Farid had scuffled with each other twice. During their second brawl, Farid, after thrashing Shera, had taken pictures of the latter and then circulated them further, which Akansh had objected to.</p>
      <p>Then, on the fateful night as well, when Akansh intervened in the argument between Shera and Farid, Randhawa and Farid shouted at Akansh by rolling down the windowpanes of their BMW. “Are you Shera’s bodyguard? We will see you first and then we will see Shera.”</p>
      <p>Then the accused hit Akansh with their BMW and ran him over twice with the intention of killing him outside the residence of Deep in Sector 9 on the intervening night of February 9 and 10, 2017.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Randhawa yet to be traced, Harmehtab never got bail</b>
      </p>
      <p>Randhawa, who has been declared a PO in the case, is yet to be arrested by the Crime Branch of Chandigarh Police. Accused Harmehtab, who is facing trial after he surrendered on February 16, 2017, has not been granted bail since the day he has been arrested.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reactions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adamya Singh Rathore, complainant: “Finally justice has prevailed. Akansh must find peace now. I wish I could bring him back. After Farid has been held guilty, the police shall also take Balraj Randhawa in the net.”</p>
      <p>Hartaj Singh Rarewala, brother of Farid: “May the Lord give my brother strength to face this difficult period! I have no parents or grandparents to support me through this. Farid is all I have.”</p>
