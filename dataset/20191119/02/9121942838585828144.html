      <p>BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have arrested a man and raided his apartment over suspicions he was planning an attack.</p>
      <p>The country’s federal prosecutor said in a statement that the man was arrested Tuesday in Berlin. His identity was not given but he was described as a “radical Islamist,” who was planning an attack in Germany to “kill and injure a maximum number of people.”</p>
      <p>Berlin prosecutors told the dpa news agency that the suspect is a 37-year-old Syrian who got information online on how to build bombs and talked about planning an attack in internet chats.</p>
      <p>In January, the suspect allegedly started procuring material and chemicals, including acetone and hydrogen peroxide, to build an explosive device.</p>
      <p>It was not clear when and where exactly the attack was going to happen.</p>
