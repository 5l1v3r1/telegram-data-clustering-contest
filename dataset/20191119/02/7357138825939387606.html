      <p>Security researchers have discovered that thousands of Disney+ accounts have been hacked and are for sale on the Dark Web.</p>
      <p>Disney’s new streaming service launched less than a week ago, and reportedly already has 10 million <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/subscriptions/2019/disney-streaming-service-has-signed-10m-subscribers-within-one-day/">subscribers</a>. Verizon even announced in October that it was going to give all new and existing Fios, 5G home internet and Verizon unlimited wireless customers a free one-year subscription to the Disney service.</p>
      <p>Now <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">ZDNet </a>said hackers started hijacking Disney+ user accounts hours after the service launched, with researchers claiming to have found “thousands” of Disney+ accounts for sale on the Dark Web, available for sale for prices anywhere from $3 to $11. In fact, some users reported that within hours of the launch, hackers had already accessed their accounts, logged them out of all devices, and then changed the account’s email and password.</p>
      <p>“Disney + launch has been absolutely horrible. Their customer service is no help at all and apparently, hundreds of accounts were hacked and sold online. My account got hacked &amp; email/password changed, thankfully I canceled my subscription before the hack,” tweeted one user on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>Disney did not respond to questions about security measures in place to protect user accounts. The researchers at ZDNet pointed out, however, that it doesn’t look like Disney+ was actually hacked. Instead, users were tricked into handing out their account credentials.</p>
      <p>“What Disney+ is facing right now is what other streaming services have been fighting against for years. Hacking forums have been overflowing with hacked Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Netflix accounts. The reason hackers are still putting up new accounts for sale on a regular basis is because people are buying,” the researchers wrote. “The advice for Disney+ account holders is to use unique passwords for their accounts. This won’t prevent malware on their devices from stealing their passwords, but it will prevent the most common scenario of hackers gaining access to accounts just by guessing the password.”</p>
