      <p>NEW YORK — President Donald Trump has lost his latest bid to delay a former “Apprentice” contestant’s defamation suit as he faces a Jan. 31 deadline to undergo sworn pretrial questioning.</p>
      <p>A New York judge rejected Trump’s request Monday, meaning that Summer Zervos’ case can continue. Trump can pursue other legal avenues to try to hold it off.</p>
      <p>Zervos’ lawyer, Mariann Wang, declined to comment. A request for comment was sent to Trump’s lawyers.</p>
      <p>Zervos appeared on “The Apprentice” in 2006. She says the then-businessman subjected her to unwanted kissing and groping in 2007 and slurred her by calling her a liar when she came forward publicly in 2016. His lawyers have argued his statements weren’t defamatory.</p>
      <p>Trump’s attorneys have repeatedly tried to get the case dismissed, or postponed until after his presidency.</p>
