      <p>The State government has directed the Tribal Welfare and Panchayat Raj departments to expedite works under the Giri Vikasam, land development for Scheduled Tribes, envisaging conversion of uncultivable lands owned by small and marginal ST farmers into cultivable lands.</p>
      <p>Ministers E. Dayakar Rao and Satyavati Rathod reviewed the progress of the scheme with senior officials of the two departments on Monday. They directed the officials to complete identification of beneficiaries under the programme so that the developed land could be handed over to them at the earliest.</p>
      <p>They said the Tribal Welfare Department had forwarded works estimated to cost ₹ 46 crore to the Rural Development Department. The government had sanctioned ₹ 61 crore in the current year’s budget for taking up Giri Vikasam scheme. They wanted the officials concerned to hold meeting with the district Collectors and other officials concerned for chalking out an action plan to expeditiously complete the work.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dayakar Rao wanted the officials of Rural Development Department to work out modalities for ensuring that the department provides matching grant for the construction of Anganwadi buildings. Officials were asked to speedily complete the process as the Central government is also providing funds under the scheme.</p>
