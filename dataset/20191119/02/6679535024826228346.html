      <h2>More tests necessary to ascertain if the attack had caused injury to spine</h2>

      <p>The condition of Congress MLA and former Minister Tanveer Sait is critical after an assailant stabbed him with a machete at a wedding ceremony in Mysuru late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>A bleeding Mr. Sait was rushed to a private hospital nearby. Surgery was carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of doctors before he was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and kept on ventilator.</p>
      <p>“The ventilator was removed later in the evening [Monday] as he was responding well to treatment,” said sources in Columbia Asia Hospital, Mysuru, where he is being treated.</p>
      <p>The assailant has been identified as Farhan Pasha, 24, a handicraft artisan, who told the police that he had approached Mr. Sait a couple of times for a job, but was disillusioned by the delay.</p>
      <p>He attacked Mr. Sait while he was watching an orchestra after dinner at the ceremony at Bal Bhavan in Mysuru and tried to escape. But, he was caught by some guests and Mr. Sait’s supporters, thrashed and turned over to the police.</p>
      <p>Visuals showed the MLA holding a hand to his injured neck and walking out of the venue with support. But, he collapsed in the car on the way to hospital.</p>
      <p>“He has had a grievous injury to the blood vessels, nerves and surrounding internal organs in the neck,” said a statement issued by the hospital earlier on Monday, adding that his bleeding was controlled and he was put on ventilator and drugs to maintain his blood pressure. “He was transfused with blood products as he had heavy blood loss,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>The doctors said the attack had caused a deep wound on the neck, which had damaged the veins and nerves. A team of doctors comprising neurosurgeon Maqsood and Head and Neck surgeon Dattatreya managed to stem the bleeding.</p>
      <p>But, Upendra Shenoy, Medical Superintendent of the hospital, told reporters on Monday morning that more tests were necessary to ascertain if the attack had caused any injury to the spine or other organs.</p>
      <p>While discussing Mr. Sait’s condition, Dr. Shenoy said the nerves and veins that had been cut in the attack go to the brain from the heart. “Right now, the condition is critical. Only after his condition stabilises, can we put him on observation.”</p>
      <p>However, Dr. Shenoy said Mr. Sait was responding well to the treatment and he will remain in the ICU for another 24 to 48 hours. Though the MLA did not have any serious health issues, the doctors are keeping his blood pressure and diabetes under check.</p>
      <p>“We are doing our best and we hope and pray that he recovers soon,” Dr. Shenoy said, before asking the public not to visit the hospital. He said the patient’s wife and children are with him.</p>
      <h3>Motive to be ascertained</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mysuru City Police Commissioner K.T. Balakrishna said the accused was being interrogated and the motive behind the attack is yet to be ascertained.</p>
      <p>The Narasimharaja Police, who took the accused into custody, booked a case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and charged him with attempt to murder.</p>
      <p>Security has been beefed up around the hospital where a large number of Mr. Sait’s supporters arrived after learning about the incident.</p>
