      <h1>NCAA’s latest player allowance isn’t going to cut it</h1>

      <p>It’s a nice try by the NCAA. But not enough.</p>
      <p>The last vestige of slave labor is finally about to end. The NCAA said recently that it will <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/ncaa-will-allow-athletes-to-cash-in-on-fame/">allow some student-athletes to get paid</a> for endorsing products.</p>
      <p>I’ve written about this a lot in the past. If the NCAA and colleges make money off their labor — and they make billions — then the athletes who also happen to be going to school should be paid for their efforts.</p>
      <p>The endorsement announcement is welcome news. But it’s a stopgap measure by the schools — who will still get their athletes’ services for free by passing the costs on to companies like Nike that’ll put their logo on the players’ everythings.</p>
