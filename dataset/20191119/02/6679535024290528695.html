      <p>Leader of the Opposition in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Abdul Wajid on Monday alleged misappropriation of funds in BBMP projects taken up after the BJP came to power in the civic body.</p>
      <p>He alleged that asphalting under the Smart City project cost ₹14.3 crore to ₹15.17 crore, which was more than the white-topping project. He urged the government to investigate this matter.</p>
      <p>He also said that the Capt. R.R. Doddihal Committee report has given a clean chit to the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition that was in power in the BBMP.</p>
      <p>Recently, S.R. Vishwanath, Political Secretary to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, had written to the Urban Development Department’s Additional Chief Secretary E.V. Ramana Reddy expressing his dissatisfaction with the report that looked into the allegations of corruption in the white-topping and TenderSURE projects that was taken up during the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition.</p>
