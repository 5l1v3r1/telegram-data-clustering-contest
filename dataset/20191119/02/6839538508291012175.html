      <p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has gifted the Prince of Wales 10 native trees as part of her government's reforestation effort.</p>
      <p>The Kiwi leader revealed her unusual present after meeting with Charles on day two of the Royal Visit to New Zealand.</p>
      <p>On a warm and cloud-strewn day in Auckland, sunlight beamed onto the royals as they received a traditional Maori greeting on the lawns of Government House.</p>
      <p>With Ardern and Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy watching on, a group of men and women performed a spectacular three-part welcome, featuring a 'wero', or challenge, where Charles picked up a dart from the grass, the 'karanga' or call of welcome, and the 'haka', or dance of welcome.</p>
      <p>Ardern then met with the prince, opting for discretion on their topics of discussion.</p>
      <p>"It's obviously practice not to give full disclosures around what's discussed in meetings with the royal family," she said.</p>
      <p>"We had a fantastic exchange about issues particularly pertaining to the environment ... he's well ahead of his time."</p>
      <p>The leader of the Opposition, National head Simon Bridges, was also granted an audience with the prince.</p>
      <p>Bridges was more forthcoming, saying he was surprised by the extent of the prince's knowledge of local affairs.</p>
      <p>"He's been coming here many times, since before I was born, and he really has a good sense of it, what is happening," he said.</p>
      <p>Bridges - who describes himself as a "reluctant monarchist" - said Charles' knowledge extended to the passing of New Zealand's world-leading climate bill through parliament earlier this month, with cross-party support.</p>
      <p>"We discussed a number of environmental and sustainability issues. He was aware of the Zero Carbon Bill and that National had supported this," he said.</p>
      <p>While Ardern gifted the native trees, which will be planted somewhere in New Zealand, Bridges gave a pot of honey gathered from a golf course in his electorate, just outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>As Charles took the political meetings, the Duchess of Cornwall headed across town to participate in a domestic violence roundtable.</p>
      <p>At lunchtime, the pair walked along Auckland's Viaduct Harbour, glad-handing Royalists and rubberneckers alike, and visiting Team New Zealand's headquarters for the forthcoming America's Cup.</p>
      <p>Around 500 people showed up for a chance to see the royals, with the walk passing without incident.</p>
      <p>One man introduced his dog, Charlie the Pomeranian, to the royal couple, while Charles laughed as he reached over the crowd to fist-pump a man with a tattooed arm.</p>
      <p>The day ends with a reception at Government House, hosted by the governor-general, featuring a who's who of Kiwi artistic, business and sporting life.</p>
