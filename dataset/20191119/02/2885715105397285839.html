      <h1>Chandigarh: Vendors still in no-vending zones, hearing today</h1>
      <h2>Just a week before the court hearing, the corporation served notices on 1,300 vendors. Also, merely two days before the hearing, an advertisement in the newspaper was given about removal of vendors.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:19:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/hina-rohtaki/" target="_blank">Hina Rohtaki</a></address>
      <p>EXACTLY FOUR weeks have passed ever since the Punjab and Haryana High Court had ordered the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Administration and Municipal Corporation to remove and relocate the vendors but the authorities have been unable to remove the vendors from no-vending zones like Sector 17 and those from sectors 1 to 6. The next hearing is to be held on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Just a week before the court hearing, the corporation served notices on 1,300 vendors. Also, merely two days before the hearing, an advertisement in the newspaper was given about removal of vendors.</p>
      <p>“We have served 1,300 notices. As per the Act, we cannot ask them to go immediately. Thirty days’ time has to be given to them,” a senior officer of the enforcement wing stated.</p>
      <p>Sector 17 and other no-vending zones of ward 1 continue to remain “flea markets” with hundreds of vendors encroaching on the land.</p>
      <p>The chairman of Federation of Sectors Welfare Association of Chandigarh, Baljinder Singh Bittu, stated, “This is all a formality they are doing. The officials themselves do not want to remove the vendors. All these days they did nothing and then they started serving notices on vendors just a few days back.”</p>
      <p>Former Congress councillor Pardeep Chhabra said, “Officials work in connivance, so they cannot remove them.”<br/>Vendors near the Sukhna Lake have moved the Supreme Court but the case has not been taken up for hearing as yet.</p>
      <p>On October 17, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a deadline of four weeks to the Chandigarh Administration and Chandigarh Municipal Corporation for removal and relocation of registered vendors from no-vending zones like Sector 17 and Ward 1 (Sectors 1-6) and ordered that the authorities take immediate steps for removal of unregistered vendors from across the city.</p>
      <p>The order was passed during the hearing of a bunch of petitions filed by Sector 17, Sector 22 traders, Sector 15 residents and a number of vendors from different areas seeking different relief from the court.</p>
      <p>There were nearly 22,000 vendors in the city but only 9,356 vendors were found eligible for registration during the survey conducted by the Town Vending Committee under the Street Vendors Act, 2014. There are 44 vending zones in the city with 5,034 vending sites.</p>
      <p>There are 641 street vendors in Sector 17. The corporation had stated that they would be relocating the vendors of Sector 17 to Sector 15, but nothing has moved much.</p>
