      <h1>Video: Cassius Winston Addresses Michigan State Crowd After Brother’s Death</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:12:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Michigan State point guard Cassius Winston has been playing through an unspeakable tragedy. On Saturday, Nov. 9, Winston’s <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/michigan-state/michigan-state-cassius-winston-brother-zachary-killed-train">younger brother Zachary was killed</a> after being struck by a train.</p>
      <p>The outpouring of support for Winston and his family has been widespread, coming from within and outside the Michigan State family. Incredibly, the senior All-American has not missed a game for the Spartans.</p>
      <p>After tonight’s home blowout win over Charleston Southern, Winston addressed the crowd in East Lansing. It was his first time speaking publicly since his brother’s passing.</p>
      <p>“I lost a piece of my heart but you guys are keeping me going,” Winston said. “I love everything about this place and I really do appreciate you guys.”</p>
      <p>There couldn’t have been too many dry eyes in the Breslin Center by the time he was done. Check out the video below courtesy of MLive.com’s Kyle Austin.</p>

      <p>We can’t imagine what Winston and his family have been going through. It is amazing though to witness his strength throughout this ordeal.</p>
      <p>We continue to wish him the best.</p>
