      <h1>The Field Conditions For Chargers-Chiefs Are A Disaster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:38:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Remember when the Chiefs and Rams were supposed to play at Estadio Azteca last season but the game was moved due to poor field conditions? Well, things haven’t changed in a year.</p>
      <p>Almost one year to the day of that contest being shifted to LA, the Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers are actually playing in Mexico City tonight. The field conditions are, shall we say, sub-optimal.</p>
      <p>Throughout the first half, we’ve seen chunks of grass and dirt flying everywhere during and after plays. Players have been struggling to gain footing all evening, and there are noticeable divots in the playing surface.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the field conditions are getting destroyed by media members covering and watching the game.</p>

      <p>There are a few American football stadiums with notoriously bad footing–looking at you, FedEx Field–but this seems especially bad. Hopefully no one gets hurt.</p>
      <p>Estadio Azteca is a multi-purpose stadium best known for housing soccer matches. It is the home grounds for Mexican pro soccer club Cruz Azul and has hosted multiple World Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>For football though, it leaves a lot to be desired, at least in terms of surface quality.</p>
