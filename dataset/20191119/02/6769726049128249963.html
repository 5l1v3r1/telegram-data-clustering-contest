      <h1>Mandurah players make U16s State Performance Program</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Kirby</a></address>
      <p>BASKETBALL WA’s 2020 U16s State Performance Program players have been announced.</p>
      <p>Eleven Mandurah players were selected for the Men and Women’s country program.</p>
      <p>Levi Delamere, Joe Macdonald and Matt Thomson will take part in the men’s program while Katie Duncan, Sydney Meares, Kaitlyn Srhoj, Holly Britton, Jorja Haines, Kate Newson, Mackenzie Pitter and Sierraleone Simpson will join the women’s program.</p>
      <p>Holly Britton and Joe Macdonald are excited about the opportunity.</p>
      <p>They both started playing around seven years old and began moving up through different teams.</p>
      <p>Macdonald was introduced to the sport by his dad, who played college basketball in America and fell in love with the game.</p>
      <p>Britton is a Point Guard and enjoys playing with her teammates as well as facing new challenges.</p>
      <p>“I think (the reason I have stuck with basketball is) it’s always being given new opportunities and new teams,” she said.</p>
      <p>She felt nervous about the tryouts despite making the state u15s team the week before.</p>
      <p>“I was a bit more nervous because I am at the bottom age, so there are a lot of older girls so a little bit nervous, but once I warmed up it was alright,” she said.</p>
      <p>Macdonald went through a similar process last year when he made the u16s squad as a 15-year-old.</p>
      <p>“It was a lot about teamwork and listening basically… if you could play defence you would probably make the team,” he said.</p>
      <p>After last year he will look to take the next step by improving his ball-handling as well as his strength and speed.</p>
      <p>They are both raring to go, and with big aspirations, they are players to look out for in the future.</p>
