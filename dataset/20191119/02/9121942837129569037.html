      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Amid month-long anti-government protests, Lebanon will host North Korea in an empty stadium in a World Cup qualifying game.</p>
      <p>The Asian Football Confederation says the decision followed advice “to guarantee high security standards and a safe environment for the teams and match officials.”</p>
      <p>The game is to be played Tuesday at the 49,000-capacity Sports City Stadium in Beirut.</p>
      <p>Lebanon and North Korea trail one point behind South Korea in Group H. Two teams advance to the next round.</p>
      <p>Lebanon has been rocked by protests during an economic crisis which led Prime Minister Saad Hariri to resign three weeks ago. A parliamentary session was postponed Tuesday by the demonstrations.</p>
