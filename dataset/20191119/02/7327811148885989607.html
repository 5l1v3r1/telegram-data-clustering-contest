      <p>MIDTOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- Crews responded to the scene of an underground water and steam leak in Midtown during rush hour on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>The incident was reported at 49th Street and 8th Avenue around 5:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Because of the situation, West 49th Street was shut down between Broadway and 8th Avenue.</p>
      <p>Officials say the underground leak somehow led to an eruption of steam. In some areas, dust debris and mud from the ground flew onto nearby cars in the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>No injuries have been reported, but crews are working to determine what was in that dust.</p>
      <p>DEP and Con Edison also responded to the scene.</p>
      <p>Three buildings in the area were without steam service while DEP made repairs.</p>
      <p>8th Avenue reopened Monday night though some lanes remained closed with potentially contaminated dirt in need of a cleanup.</p>
