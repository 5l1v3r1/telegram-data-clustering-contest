      <h1>Remember It, Jake: It’s Netflix’s <i>Chinatown</i> Prequel Series, Currently In Development</h1>

      <p>It’s a prequel. It’s a reboot. It’s a prequel AND a reboot! According to Deadline, Netflix is <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/chinatown-prequel-series-pilot-robert-towne-david-fincher-netflix-1202789041/">currently developing</a> a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/chinatown/"><i>Chinatown</i></a><i> </i>prequel television series based on the 1974 Roman Polanski neo-noir, for which the film’s screenwriter Robert Towne took home the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Towne will reportedly work alongside director David Fincher to write the Netflix show’s pilot.</p>
      <p>The series will focus on J.J. “Jake” Gittes, the private investigator played by Jack Nicholson in the film, as a younger man tangling with money, crime, and corruption in Los Angeles, sometime before <i>Chinatown</i>’s 1937 setting. Considering all the murder, malfeasance and incest Jake must have seen <i>before</i> the events of the movie, it’s honestly pretty shocking he didn’t know it was Chinatown already.</p>
