      <p>VICTORIA - Oil and gas companies in British Columbia would be forced by law to reveal how gas prices are set in the province if new legislation introduced today is passed.</p>
      <p>Jobs Minister Bruce Ralston says the Fuel Price Transparency Act would allow the B.C. Utilities Commission to collect information from fuel companies on market conditions involved in setting gasoline prices.</p>
      <p>The B.C. government asked the independent utilities commission last summer to examine fuel prices in the province as gasoline costs in Metro Vancouver were consistently the highest in Canada, reaching $1.70 per litre and above.</p>
      <p>The commission found substantial price increases in B.C.'s gasoline market, including a cost of about 13 cents per litre charged to drivers that the industry was unable to explain.</p>
      <p>Ralston says that unexplained premium results in residents and businesses in B.C. paying an extra $490 million every year for fuel.</p>
      <p>He says the act will require companies to share data on refined fuel imports and exports, fuel volumes at refineries and terminals and wholesale and retail prices.</p>
