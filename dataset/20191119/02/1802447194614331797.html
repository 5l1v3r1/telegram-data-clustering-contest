      <p>The Chargers have dominated the Chiefs everywhere except on the scoreboard.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles gained 312 yards on 43 plays and got into Kansas City territory on five of six first-half possessions. The Chargers’ two red-zone possessions ended at the Kansas City 9 and 8 and resulted in <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13410/mike-badgley">Michael Badgley</a> field goals of 27 and 26 yards.</p>
      <p>Badgley made a 49-yarder on the final play of the first half, but he missed a 40-yard field goal earlier and <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/1813/philip-rivers">Philip Rivers</a> has thrown two interceptions to keep the Chargers on the short end of scoring in the first half.</p>
      <p>The Chiefs lead 10-9.</p>
      <p>Rivers is 18-of-28 for 237 yards. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12563/austin-ekeler">Austin Ekeler</a> has six catches for 95 yards and four runs for 25 yards, and <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/10284/melvin-gordon">Melvin Gordon</a> has 10 rushes for 58 yards.</p>
      <p>The game’s only touchdown came after a <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/8387/tyrann-mathieu">Tyrann Mathieu</a> interception of Rivers. His 35-yard return to the Los Angeles 6-yard line led to a 6-yard <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy">LeSean McCoy</a> touchdown run.</p>
      <p>The Chiefs added a 41-yard <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12433/harrison-butker">Harrison Butker</a> field goal with 1:43 remaining in the first half to cap a nine-play, 52-yard drive.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12142/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> has had his own problems, going 8-for-15 for 63 yards and an interception. It’s the fewest yards he ever has had in a first half in his career.</p>
      <p>He does not have his lead receiver with <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11458/tyreek-hill">Tyreek Hill</a> having left after the first possession with a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>Mahomes is the team’s leading rusher with one carry for 24 yards.</p>
      <p>The Chiefs have run only 23 plays and gained only 109 yards.</p>
