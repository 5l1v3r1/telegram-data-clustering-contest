      <p>After 16 years away, the <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> property finally <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484770/charlies-angels-end-credits-which-celebrities-make-cameo-appearances">returned to the big screen</a> this past weekend, and things did not go well for it at the box office… like, at all. The new movie starring <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484900/kristen-stewart-was-left-off-her-leash-when-it-came-to-ad-libbing-for-charlies-angels">Kristen Stewart</a>, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska only pulled in $8.3 million during its first days in domestic theaters, with its worldwide haul only adding up to around $27.6 million.</p>
      <p>Considering it was made off a budget of between $48-$55 million, it’s safe to say that <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> is not a commercial hit, and Director Elizabeth Banks, who also wrote the screenplay, produced and starred as one of the Bosleys, joked about her movie’s performance with the following, self-deprecating tweet:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/ElizabethBanks/status/1196486758503833600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>She has a point; regardless about how you feel about <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, at least Elizabeth Banks can say she left her stamp on it in four different areas. And even if it’s not doing well at the box office, Banks said on <a href="https://twitter.com/ElizabethBanks/status/1196486758503833600">Twitter</a> that she’s happy with how the product turned out and that people get to see it. It’s worth noting that on the commercial spectrum, <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484553/charlies-angels-reviews-are-in-heres-what-the-critics-are-saying">falls into mixed territory</a>, ranking at 59% on Rotten Tomatoes among critics, but earning an 81% audience score, as well as a B+ over at Cinemascore.</p>
      <p>So <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> isn’t a flop across the board, but alas, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484987/why-didnt-more-fans-watch-the-new-charlies-angels-movie">not a lot of people turned out to see it in theaters</a>. But Elizabeth Banks is standing by her work, and she also recently defended the property back by <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485025/elizabeth-banks-defends-the-studio-remaking-charlies-angels">pointing out how many Spider-Man movies there have been</a>. That's fair to say, as we’ve seen three different live action incarnations of the Web-Slinger in less than 20 years, so <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> was certainly entitled for another go-around in a cinematic setting.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, rather than serving as a straightforward reboot, the new <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> movie is actually a continuation of the original 1970s TV series and the first two movies that came out in 2000 and 2003… but not the short-lived TV revival from 2011. That’s better off being forgotten. In addition to the actors mentioned above, <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> cast also boasted folks like Patrick Stewart, Djimon Honsou, Sam Clafin and Noah Centineo, not to mention <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484964/how-elizabeth-banks-approached-those-wild-charlies-angels-cameos">some surprise cameos at the end</a>.</p>
      <p>In any case, with the way <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> has done so far, it’s incredibly unlikely that we’ll see this newest generation of ass-kicking spies return for a sequel adventure. By weekend’s end, <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> ranked in third place at the box office, with <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> taking the #1 spot and <i>Midway</i>, which came out the weekend prior, coming in at #2. Whether it will make even come close to making a profit remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>As for Elizabeth Banks, while <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> wasn’t received the way she wanted it to be, she has enough to keep herself busy in the near future. Banks is starring in the upcoming Hulu miniseries <i>Mrs. America</i>, and she’s also been attached to star alongside Anthony Mackie in <i>Signal Hill</i> for the past two years.</p>
