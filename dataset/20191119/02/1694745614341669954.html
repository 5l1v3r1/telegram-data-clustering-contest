      <h1>Holy Kris Kringle! This 10-Year-Old's Christmas List Must Mean Her Parents Are Millionaires</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:10:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:10</time> by <a rel="author">Chanel Vargas</a></address>
      <p>A 10-year-old girl's Christmas wish list has gone viral after her dad shared a picture of it to his Twitter account, and, uh, we don't blame him for being absolutely shook. "My 10 year old daughter must be out of her mind with this Christmas list," Twitter user @a_johnson412 captioned the photo of the handrwitten list. Punctuated by cute spelling errors, the list includes an iPhone 11, a MacBook Air, Gucci Slides, "purfum," a Chanel Purse, AirPods, and "aesenchal oils," just to name a few things — so, is it bad if I want everything on this list, too?</p>
      <p>My parents would have totally thought I was delusional if I wrote a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/should-parents-make-christmas-gift-registry-for-kids-46894699">Christmas wish list</a> like this growing up — only partially because half of the things on this list didn't exist yet. But I have to give this little girl props for having her priorities straight. She wants an alarm clock, new sheets, and essential oils, aka the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Best-Self-Care-Gifts-44197265">ultimate self-care package</a>!</p>
      <p>When I was 10 years old, my Christmas wish list included sparkly nail polish, gel pens, coloring books, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hilary-duff-bangs-lizzie-mcguire-reboot-46906920">Hilary Duff</a>'s <b>Most Wanted</b> CD. But after reading this list, I think this 10-year-old might have just inspired me to ask for $4,000 on my Christmas list this year. Keep scrolling to see a few Twitter reactions to the already viral tweet, which has over 125,000 likes.</p>
