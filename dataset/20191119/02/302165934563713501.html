      <p>PARIS, Nov 19 — An original score of two minuets composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart when he was just 16 blew past estimates at a Sotheby’s auction in Paris yesterday, going under the hammer for €372,500 (RM1.7 million).</p>
      <p>It was nearly double the top estimated value of €200,000 set for the handwritten score dating from 1772, and which formed part of the extensive music collection of a fellow Austrian, the writer Stefan Zweig.</p>
      <p>The unpublished, autographed score of the minuets — a stylised dance — contains a few corrections and minor modifications, including one or two that might be in the hand of Mozart’s father, Leopold.</p>
      <p>The manuscript was kept in Mozart’s birthplace Salzburg by the composer’s sister, Nannerl, before finding its way into Zweig’s collection.</p>
      <p>The score, the only one of the composer’s “Six Minuets K.164” to still be in private hands, came from the library of the eminent Swiss bibliophile Jean-Francois Chaponniere.</p>
      <p>Mozart, a child prodigy, began composing at a very early age under his father’s guidance.</p>
      <p>The sale comes ahead of an offering by rival auction house Christie’s in Paris next week of a rare portrait of Mozart, made when the musical genius was just 13.</p>
      <p>The work, one of few Mozart paintings still in private hands, is expected to fetch €800,000 to €1.2 million. — AFP</p>
