      <h1>Bangalore in Kannada films</h1>

      <p><i>The nexus seen between the rowdies and politicians in Bengaluru in the late seventies and the eighties found several cinematic portrayals in films</i> <br/><br/>Banished from his village for a theft he hadn’t committed, Muttanna, the hero of the hit Kannada film, Mayor Muttanna (1969), finds his way to Bengaluru. At night, he goes to sleep at the foot of the statue of Kempe Gowda. Shortly thereafter, a policeman on the beat comes by and orders him to leave from there. As the policeman shoves him out, Muttanna turns around to look up at the statue. “Gowdre! Kempe Gowdre! You built this town so that hundreds could live a contented life. If an orphan like me can’t find a little room to sleep at your feet, what kind of a town is this? Please, please! Don’t get angry at me, my lord. I’ll take leave now.” <br/><br/>A song from Mane Katti Nodu (Try Building a House, 1966) titled, “Look, How Bengaluru City Has Grown,” - the first film song on Bengaluru – could easily single out the attractions of the city: the “lovely Vidhana Soudha ,” the beautiful gardens, the factories, the institutions of learning. Even when other films don’t abide by this idyllic image of the city, like for example, Mayor Muttanna, where a song dwells on the city’s wealth disparities and the need for them to be overcome by humaneness, Bangalore is not held as a non-redeemable social entity. The film indeed ends with the virtuous hero being elected as the city’s mayor. <br/><br/>Mannina Maga (Son of the Soil, 1968) depicts a dramatic turning away from Bangalore in favour of a village. Amused to see her father insisting that the house servant address him as “Sir” in English and not as “Swamy” in Kannada, the heroine insists that he call her “Amma” and not “Madam.” In a hit song, she protests from inside a cabaret performance in a restaurant, “Is this civilization (sabhyate) Is this culture?” and asks that Gandhi and Nehru not be forgotten, that the problems of the country, such as hunger and clothing, be borne in mind. Later in the film, she leaves Bangalore to live her life in a village with a farmer she has fallen for. <br/><br/>While such an attitude of rejecting the city is rare, an affirmation of the possibility or, the difficulty, of sustaining community life in a city is more common. <br/><br/>The nexus seen between the rowdies and politicians in Bengaluru in the late seventies and the eighties, which allowed a range of extortion rackets to flourish with the complicity of the police, found several cinematic portrayals in films like Chakravyooha (1983) or in more recent reconstructions of that era such as Aa Dinagalu (2007). From the mid-nineties, a slew of highly violent Kannada films, which can be termed machchu-longu (hatchet-long sword) films, depicted Bangalore as a crime ridden, morality-forsaken city month after month across fifteen years. This period was the time of the real estate boom in the city, which in turn saw high levels of criminal activity in the underworld. With the crimes related to real estate spiralling upwards, new styles of cinematic representation emerged to capture the realness of the new urban violence. <br/><br/>Majestic (2001), the hit film, introduces Bangalore as a city where “people make money in the name of God.” Another film, Om-Kara (2004), begins with a voiceover against scenes from the city: “This is the capital of the underworld. In this city that never sleeps, in this big city that laughs hoarsely while people fight over money, helpless, innocent, people get burnt in the searing sun while others strip for money and sell themselves in red-light areas, the battle for money is seen in every street.” In another film, Mental Manja (2005), a voiceover rolls out against images of little boys threatening little girls with blades and knives: “Bengaluru: what we call Green City today will no doubt become Bloody City.” <br/><br/>The collapse of law and the presence of unscrupulous politicians, police officers, businessmen and goons in the <i>macchu-longu</i> films provide the archetypal setting of a degenerate city where the battle between virtue and evil is staged. Urban poverty and squalor unfold in scenes of melodramatic docu-realism in these films: children eat leftovers found in dustbins; a married woman prostitutes herself to buy medicine for her epileptic daughter; the hero’s mother works as a cleaner in a marriage hall. Stark and unromantic scenes of Bangalore’s underbelly flicker through the violent machchu-longu films - autorickshaw depots, slums, pimps, prostitutes, beggars, mutton shops, poultry farms, cow-sheds, sleazy bars, omelette carts - ensuring in the end a more heterogenous cinema archive of Bangalore. <br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of action, romance, crime and comedy films have of course been set in Bangalore. While they capture features of the city landscape like parks, apartments, five-star hotels, restaurants, college campuses and malls as backdrop and hold out, on occasion, footage of uncommon scenes – for instance, the scenes of tenement life in Ganeshana Madhuve (1990) and of factory work in Anuraga Aralitu (1986) - or capture signs of urban hipness, they don’t usually offer reflections on urban life outside of the pre-established metaphysics of community life. Deeveri (1999), which offers an amoral depiction of the tough slum life led by migrant siblings, proves an exception. <br/><br/>The broad brushstroke account above is less committed to being fully representative about how Bangalore has been objectified in Kannada films than it is to setting off a possible thought. <br/><br/><br/><i>(Translations of the film quotes are by the author)</i></p>
