      <p>A Federal High Court in Lagos has sentenced a 62-year-old man, Nurudeen Aremu, to nine years in jail for trafficking in cocaine.</p>
      <p>Aremu was charged by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on three counts bordering on conspiracy and drug trafficking.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Aremu was first arraigned on March 7 and he pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>However, he changed his plea on November 14, and was subsequently re-arraigned where he pleaded guilty.</p>
      <p>Following his guilty plea, the court adjourned the case for a review of the facts.</p>

      <p>On November 15, the Prosecution counsel, Juliana Iroabuchi, tendered nine exhibits which were all admitted.</p>
      <p>Iroabuchi urged the court to sentence Aremu based on the evidence adduced by prosecution.</p>
      <p>Justice Maureen Onyetenu found Aremu guilty of the offences, and sentenced him to four years imprisonment on count one, three years’ imprisonment on count two and two year’s jail term on count three.</p>
      <p>The judge ordered that the terms shall run concurrently.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the prosecution counsel said that Aremu committed the offences on December 27, 2018.</p>
      <p>She said that he was arrested at the Gate C, Departure Hall of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, during an outward clearance of passengers on board an Ethiopian Airline flight to India.</p>
      <p>Iroabuchi said that Aremu concealed 2.66kg of cocaine in a brown travelling bag.</p>
