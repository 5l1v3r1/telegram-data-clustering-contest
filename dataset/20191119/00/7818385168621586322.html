      <h1>Baring Private Equity Signs MoU for $1.2 Billion Lumenis Acquisition Deal</h1>
      <h2>The deal is expected to be completed in early 2020, according to the two companies</h2>

      <p><b>Update:</b> Baring and Lumenis officialy <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/baring-private-equity-asia-agrees-to-acquire-lumenis-872068753.html">confirmed </a>Calcalist's report, stating the deal is valued at over $1 billion. The two said the deal is expected to close by early 2020.</p>
      <p>Private equity firm Baring Private Equity Asia Ltd. has signed a memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of Israel-based medical and aesthetic laser company Lumenis Ltd. for $1.2 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke with Calcalist on condition of anonymity. The deal is expected to close within a few weeks, they added.</p>
      <p>In November 2018, Calcalist <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3750338,00.html">reported </a>that Lumenis' owner, London-based private equity firm XIO Group, was close to signing a deal with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and Hong Kong-headquartered private equity firm FountainVest Partners that valued the laser company at $950 million. That deal eventually fell through due to legal troubles XIO faced. XIO acquired Lumenis in 2015 for $520 million.</p>

      <p>The deal with Baring progressed faster: Bloomberg reported the firm is <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3771156,00.html">nearing completion </a>of the negotiations in September. Baring was interested in Lumenis previously but backed down in the face of CVC, the people familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Baring, founded in 1997 and based in Hong Kong with a focus on Asia, carries out mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations, and restructuring at investments of between $300 million and $1.5 billion. The firm has $18 billion in assets under management and employs 130 people. Since its establishment, it has yielded profits of around $7 billion over 53 exits for investors.</p>
      <p>Lumenis, which develops minimally-invasive, laser-based treatments for the surgical, ophthalmological and aesthetic markets, was listed twice on Nasdaq. During its first public tenure, the company reached a $1 billion market valuation but ultimately failed and was acquired in 2006 according to a company valuation of $120 million. It relisted in 2014 at a company valuation of $470 million. The company employs 1,000 people, 400 of them in Israel, where its research and development is located.</p>
      <p>Baring has already performed most of its due diligence, and completion of the deal now depends on regulatory approval and on whether XIO settles its legal disagreements in a timely fashion.</p>
