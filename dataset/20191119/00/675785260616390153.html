      <h1>Elton John has 'no hair, prostate or appendix' as he discusses health scares</h1>
      <h2>Elton John opened up about his numerous health scares to Graham Norton, calling himself a "bionic woman"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:01:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ashleigh Rainbird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ashleigh-rainbird/</a></address>
      <p>He had an “annus horribilis” battling cancer and a life-threatening bug – but Sir <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/elton-john">Elton John</a> is still standing.</p>
      <p>And he considers himself to be a cross between the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman.</p>
      <p>Sir Elton, 72, says: “There are very few bits of me left.</p>
      <p>“There’s no hair, there’s a pacemaker. There’s no tonsils, no prostate, no appendix.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had kidney stones. I’m like the Bionic Woman. I’m like Lindsay Wagner or Steve Austin.”</p>
      <p>He was speaking to Graham Norton at his home in Nice, France, for an upcoming BBC special.</p>
      <p>Sir Elton contracted a severe infection in South America after undergoing secret surgery for prostate cancer in 2017.</p>

      <p>He has previously revealed he was told by doctors he was “24 hours away from death”.</p>
      <p>He describes learning how to walk again after 11 days in hospital.</p>
      <p>But despite the many changes to his body, Sir Elton is pleased with how he now looks – and feels especially grateful for his toupee.</p>

      <p>Admitting early, unsophisticated versions looked like a “dead mole”, he’s now chuffed with his current crop and agrees it would be the first item he would save in a fire.</p>
      <p>He says: “I pray to it every night. I’m very happy with it now.</p>
      <p>“I am very happy with it on. I do not like being bald.”</p>
