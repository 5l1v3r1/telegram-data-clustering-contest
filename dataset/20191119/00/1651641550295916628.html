      <p>Microsoft announced the Windows 10 November Update earlier this year and the update started rolling out to the consumers earlier this month. Unlike the other Windows 10 updates, the November 2019 Update doesn’t come with major features or changes.</p>
      <p>Instead, Microsoft is saving those for 20H1 and is releasing 19H2 with a set of minor improvements and changes. Microsoft has now updated its <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3159635/windows-10-update-assistant?wl">support article</a> (<i>via <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2019/11/18/more-devices-can-get-windows-10-november-2019-update-now/">Windows Latest</a></i>) confirm the availability of November 2019 Update via Media Creation Tool. In case you didn’t know, Media Creation Tool allows customers to create a Windows 10 ISO which can be used to upgrade any Windows 10 PC.</p>
      <p>However, you should be careful if using the Media Creation Tool to install the update on another PC. Since the tool can’t run a prerequisite check, it won’t be able to determine if the update is compatible with the third-party software. As of now, Microsoft is <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-blocks-windows-10-1909-update-on-pcs-with-old-realtek-bluetooth-radio-drivers/">blocking the November 2019 Update</a> on some Realtek Bluetooth Radio drivers. Apart from the old Realtek drivers, no issues have been reported so you can go ahead and install the update on other machines.</p>
