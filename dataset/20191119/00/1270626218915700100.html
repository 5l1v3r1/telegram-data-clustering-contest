      <p>Airbus has won US$30 billion worth of orders for 170 aircrafts in another sign of the continued expansion of Middle East airlines.</p>
      <p>On the second day of the Dubai Air Show, Emirates announced the purchase of 50 Airbus A350-900 XWBs - extra wide body planes at a list price of US$16 billion.</p>
      <p>That was closely followed by fast-growing low-cost carrier Air Arabia ordering 170 Airbus A320s worth US$14 billion.</p>
      <p>The European aircraft manufacturer makes its wings in the UK.</p>
      <p>Both airlines are likely to get a discount on the catalogue price, given the size of the orders.</p>
