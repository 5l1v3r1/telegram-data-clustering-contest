        <b>Brazil ended a run of five games without a win by easing to a 3-0 victory over South Korea in a friendly in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday with Philippe Coutinho scoring the pick of the goals.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Coutinho, currently on loan at Bayern Munich from Barcelona, curled a free-kick from 22 yards high into the net to put Brazil 2-0 up</b> after 35 minutes.</p>
      <p>Before that he had played a part in the opener, producing some delightful footwork to pick out Renan Lodi, whose cross from the left was headed in from close range by AC Milan midfielder Lucas Paqueta.</p>
      <p><b>Atletico Madrid left-back Lodi, 21, also set up the third goal</b> which arrived shortly after half-time, his low delivery picking out <b>Danilo</b> to score with a first-time drive from just outside the area.</p>
      <p><b>It is a first victory in six friendly outings </b>for the Selecao since their triumph at the Copa America on home soil in July.</p>
      <p>All of those matches have been played on neutral ground, with this match coming after a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Argentina in Saudi Arabia last Friday.</p>

      <p><b>Five days after a 0-0 draw in Lebanon in a 2022 World Cup qualifier</b>, South Korea were outclassed here, despite the presence of Tottenham Hotspur star <b>Son Heung-min </b>in their line-up.</p>
      <p>Once again <b>Neymar was absent for Brazil,</b> with the world's most expensive player having stayed behind at Paris Saint-Germain to work on his fitness after suffering an injury playing for his country in a 1-1 draw with Nigeria in Singapore a month ago.</p>
      <p>Perhaps his absence helped explain why the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium was barely half full for the game.</p>
      <p>Coach <b>Tite made five changes to his starting line-up following the Argentina defeat</b>, with Lodi and Coutinho coming into the side along with PSG centre-back <b>Marquinhos</b>, Liverpool midfielder <b>Fabinho</b> and Everton forward <b>Richarlison</b>.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa's <b>Douglas Luiz</b> was handed his debut as a late substitute in what is a reassuring victory for Brazil before they start South American World Cup qualifying next March.</p>
