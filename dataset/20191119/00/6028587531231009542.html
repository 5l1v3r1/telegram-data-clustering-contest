      <p>Disney has put reviewers and avid social media users in a rather uncomfortable position with <i>The Mandalorian</i>. They wanted to keep one reveal of the show so secret, they didn’t even give out screeners for the pilot. And yet the secret was that they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/16/everyone-loves-that-mandalorian-character-were-not-allowed-to-talk-about/">introduced a character</a> that is the basis for the entire season.I have so far avoided talking about the character openly, but Disney itself is <a href="https://twitter.com/themandalorian/status/1196473463063531524">now openly tweeting</a> about the little dude:</p>
      <p>Yep, that’s Baby Yoda, we are now just talking openly about Baby Yoda because he’s practically all anyone <i>can</i> talk about when it comes to <i>The Mandalorian</i> these days.</p>
      <p>He is certainly the most adorable thing to come out of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe in its entire history, I don’t think anyone is disputing that. We saw him briefly in the pilot, but then he managed to get even cuter in the next episode as he kept escaping his hover-cradle and used the force to help out our main bounty hunter when he was on death’s door. There is literally nothing he can do that is <i>not</i> cute, sitting, standing, sleeping, reaching, which is only bolstered by the fact that he’s a practical effects puppet, not CGI, so he doesn’t land in the uncanny valley. Werner Herzog said he cried when he saw Baby Yoda on set.</p>
      <p>Baby Yoda has become a fully-fledged internet meme, and while I was trying to hold off talking about it for as long as possible, he is pretty much consuming my entire timeline on every social media account, with again, even Disney itself tweeting photos of him now.</p>

      <p>The problem is not that fans just haven’t managed to watch one hour’s worth of episodes the first week. Most people who care, have. But in other regions, specifically Europe, I keep hearing, Disney Plus and <i>The Mandalorian</i> do not even arrive until some time in the spring, months from now. This is something to do with rights issues for Disney content, I believe, but that means they have to dodge spoilers for have the year when Baby Yoda is A) too adorable not to post photos of and B) it’s impossible to really talk about <i>The Mandalorian</i> in any capacity while avoiding him because he’s clearly become essentially the co-lead of the show in this “Lone Wolf and Cub” type dynamic Jon Favreau has set up here.</p>
      <p>I told my followers to mute me yesterday as I was going to start talking about the Mandalorian’s “target,” but the best move is probably just to mute all mentions of <i>The Mandalorian</i> period on social media. But you can’t mute Baby Yoda because if you know to mute Baby Yoda, it’s already been spoiled. So tough luck, non-US fans, unfortunately. And I guess I contributed to the problem here, but it seems like a futile effort, frankly.</p>
      <p>Long live Baby Yoda, we will all die for Baby Yoda.</p>
