      <p>DR Congo Football Federation have banned striker Meschack Elia for twelve months falsifying his age in an attempt to join another club without the knowledge of his parent club.</p>
      <p>Elia who has contract with giants TP Mazembe disappeared with no trace after having trials with Belgium top-flight side RSC Anderlecht in the summer.</p>
      <p>An investigation conducted by the Congolese football authorities revealed Elia has been dealing with some crooked agents with the view of joining Young Boys FC in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>The investigation also revealed that the striker changed his year of birth in a new passport from 1996 to 1997 to enable him to join the Swiss club without the knowledge and consent of TP Mazembe.</p>
      <p>Elia has then been banned from football activities for the next one year.</p>
