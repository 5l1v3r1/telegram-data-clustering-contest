      <p>Heavy smoke has covered Australia's largest city, Sydney, as scores of bushfires rage across the region.</p>
      <p>Officials say strong winds brought smoke overnight from an inland blaze north of the city, pushing Sydney's air quality to beyond "hazardous" levels.</p>
      <p>On social media, locals described waking up to hazy skies and the stench of smoke in their homes.</p>
      <p>About five million people live in the state capital of New South Wales, which has been affected for weeks by fires.</p>
      <p>Six people have died in bushfires in the north of the state since October.</p>
