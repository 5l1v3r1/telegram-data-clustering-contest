      <p>Tory shadow environment secretary Maurice Golden branded the official stats “embarrassing”</p>
      <p>He added: “It goes to show the SNP likes talking about a climate emergency, but has no intention of acting on one.”</p>
      <p>And Lib Dem transport spokesman Mike Rumbles said: “News of a climate emergency seems not to have reached Transport Scotland.</p>
      <p>“Every public body should be working out how they can reduce their impact on the planet.”</p>
      <p>The row comes after Nats vowed to cut Scotland’s carbon emissions to net-zero by 2045.</p>
      <p>And First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also declared a “climate emergency” back in April.</p>
      <p>The SNP Government’s sustainable travel strategy says flying should be a “last resort” for staff due to the high emissions.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the Scottish Government u-turned on a 2016 SNP manifesto pledge to cut and eventually scrap air passenger tax.</p>
      <p>It said the policy was “no longer compatible” with its “more ambitious” climate change targets.</p>
      <p>A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Any business flights taken by ministers or employees are offset by a carbon levy.</p>
      <p>“The levy collects £40,000 per year, and is spent in a transparent way to deliver value and compensate emissions generated.”</p>
