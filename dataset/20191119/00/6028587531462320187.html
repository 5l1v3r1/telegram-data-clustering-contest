      <p>Here’s a handy accessory for anyone who owns one of the latest Apple Mac Minis. I must confess to being sorely tempted by Apple’s smallest and most affordable Mac, I especially like its cooling system that makes the Mac Mini a compact and silent writing companion. And with SSD storage, the Mac Mini is truly silent.However, one aspect of the Mac Mini that troubles me is the fact that all the ports are ranged along the rear of the unit. It would be so much more convenient to have all the ports facing the front so you can plug in hard drives, USB thumb drives, memory cards, and headphones – without having to fumble your way around the rear of the unit feeling for ports.</p>
      <p>Satechi is a tech accessory company that’s come up with a neat solution to this issue. The Satechi Type-C Aluminum Stand and Hub for the Mac Mini sits neatly under a Mac Mini and comes in the same aluminum finish. The hub connects using a special short cable that takes up just one of the Mac Mini’s four main USB-C ports. The hub is powered by the Mac Mini and it offers users three regular USB 3.0 ports as well as one USB C data port, a slot for Micro SD and SD cards, plus a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack.</p>
      <p>The Satechi stand has built-in vents that are designed to keep the Mac Mini cool while it’s sitting on the stand. The whole product matches the Mac Mini perfectly and it’s compatible with all 2018 Mac Minis and later. </p>
      <p><b>Pricing:</b> $79.99</p>
