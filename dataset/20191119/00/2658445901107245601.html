      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Aisha, seems to have identified the source of the cocktail of social ills bedeviling the Nigerian society. Lack of moral upbringing and total collapse of family values, she noted, are the root causes of most, if not all the social ills in the country. She seemed to equally put value on divine guidance as her introspective speech made when she hosted a prayer session for the nation at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, succinctly titled “The importance of supplication for the nation’s guidance”, shows.</p>
      <p>Given her influence in the country, we commend her for seizing the moment to address parents to remember that children are like clay and parents have the duty to <u>mold the clay</u> into beautiful potteries. Her calling on heads of families to wake up to their responsibilities by providing an enabling environment for the children as a way of preventing the manifestation of many social ills is very instructive. Being a mother, the first lady understands the import of parental negligence on children.</p>
      <p>The family, being the primary and most important unit of the society, means that cohesiveness is very important for the fostering of functional products which are the children. The advocacy of the first lady is therefore very valid. Strong, united and functional families will always be in a better position to direct children towards productive endeavours. It is equally important for families to hold on to the core values that preceded the internet and tech ages. Returning to some of our valued ethical and cultural ethos would lead to better and more socially functional society.</p>
      <p>However, while we agree with the proposal from the first lady, we equally believe that it takes more than good parental upbringing to fight social ills in any country. The plethora of social ills like armed robbery, kidnapping, cultism, militancy, teenage pregnancy, banditry, religious bigotry etc., in the country show not just a country that has lost its values and family cohesion, it shows a deep seated and more frightening institutional failure beyond mere parental negligence.</p>
      <p>In every country, grooming of the next generation is structured by the state through policies and their strict execution. Most politicians win or lose elections based on the strength and viability of their visionary plans for the next generation. It is not for nothing that most crimes against  children  in most nations attract very severe punishments. It points to the value nations place on the children.</p>
      <p>We therefore believe that parents cannot just wave the magic wand and abolish all the social ills while the system does little or nothing to support the flourishing of the next generation.  Good health and education are great tools to arm children with. No matter how well parents raise their children, if the state has no well-planned health, education and other social services, the children will end up dysfunctional. There is a reason UNICEF and UNESCO insist that countries must meet a certain benchmark in their annual budgets for both the education and heath sectors.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Nigeria has consistently gone below par in budgeting for education. While the UN benchmark is at least 26%, Nigeria has never budgeted more than 10% ,so the huge 13m plus out-of-school children contribute to the number of socially dysfunctional youths.  Child marriage equally contributes to the quality of children from such union. No child can perfectly raise another. The ills from this child marriage that seem to have defied solutions, especially in the Northern region, is one ill-wind that blows no country any good.</p>
      <p>While the first lady is right in her observation, we believe that parents equally need to be psychologically and economically empowered through good implementation of government policies to perform their roles creditably.  In a country where workers are either underpaid  or owed salaries for months, struggle to survive takes precedence over the need to raise children with core values.</p>
      <p>Schools provide another avenue for value added education for kids. However, when education is not treated with the priority status it deserves, it shows not only in the decayed infrastructure but also in the quality of teachers and teaching methods.  Religious organisations must equally be supervised by the relevant government agencies to impact positively on the people and the young ones in ways that neither make them bigots nor make them fanatically unproductive. We believe that it takes a village and functional institutions to raise productive children who are every country’s future.</p>
