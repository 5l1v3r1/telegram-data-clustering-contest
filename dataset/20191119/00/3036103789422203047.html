      <h1>New Half-Life game to be unveiled this week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Valve has revealed its first new Half-Life game in 12 years.</p>
      <p>The announcement came in a <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584?s=19"><b>tweet</b></a> from the publisher yesterday, which unveiled the title of the game – Half Life: Alyx.</p>
      <p>The company said that the game would be a flagship VR title and would be officially revealed on 21 November.</p>
      <p>The last game released under the Half-Life name was 2007’s Half Life 2: Episode Two.</p>
      <p>Although it is not clear whether Half-Life: Alyx will follow on from that story, its title implies that it could focus on Alyx Vance, a prominent ally to Gordon Freeman, who was the main protagonist of the previous Half-Life titles.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/New-Half-Life-game-details-leaked-ahead-of-The-Game-Awards.443188.0.html"><b>leak</b></a> of a Game Awards interview suggested that Half-Life: Alyx would be a VR-only game that will be showcased at The Game Awards on 12 December and could be ready for launch in March 2020.</p>
      <h3>VR appeal</h3>
      <p>Virtual reality might not be enjoying widespread popularity, but a Half-Life VR title could make sense for Valve.</p>
      <p>The company offers a VR headset of its own, the Valve Index, and including a renowned title like Half-Life in Steam’s VR game library could persuade some PC gamers to purchase the Index VR kit.</p>
