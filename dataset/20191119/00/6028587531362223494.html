      <p>Stadia’s highly anticipated launch is finally here. Gaming’s future almost certainly includes some form of streaming and Google is betting big that it has the formula for success. Does it? Maybe. Google is walking a tightrope that could revolutionize gaming if Stadia keeps its balance and succeeds in reaching its full potential. However, if obstacles that lie along the way cause Stadia to lose its balance and fall, Google’s move into gaming could be an epic fail.</p>

        <b>The Good</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve written about how <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/10/26/google-stadias-exclusives-could-take-games-where-none-have-gone-before/#54842dc924ed">Stadia is in a unique position to take gaming to a place never seen before</a>. Stadia’s potential derives from the massed power of Google’s data centers and Google’s deep expertise in machine learning and natural language processing.</p>
      <p>Google currently has <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/">20 data centers</a> spread around the world. The compute power of a single server in any one of those centers is more than the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro combined. It’s unknown how many servers Google has, but the total is surely in the millions.</p>
      <p>Stadia plans to use Google’s data centers in two ways that can fundamentally change gaming. First, developers will be able to build games that demand more compute power to run than home gaming platforms can produce. Not only are the servers in Google’s data centers powerful, but cloud infrastructure is elastic which means additional servers can be recruited as needed to meet processing demands in real time. Google’s data centers have the power to run games that look like movies and can host thousands of players playing in the same world at the same time.</p>
      <p>Streaming these high-quality games is one thing, making them is another. Many video game development studios don’t have the hardware infrastructure to build games at this level. That’s where the second benefit of Google’s data centers comes into play. Google is pushing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/06/16/few-have-noticed-this-important-difference-between-microsofts-xcloud-and-googles-stadia/#27daaf27e205">the data center as a development platform for game creators</a>. Stadia gives developers the option of building and streaming games of unprecedented technical sophistication without having to commit resources to purchase and maintain the necessary infrastructure. Developers create games while Google does the heavy technical lifting. This alone is a game changer.</p>

        <figcaption>Google is in a unique position to bring sophisticated machine learning to gaming.<cite>Google</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Couple the power of Google’s data centers with the company’s expertise in machine learning and natural language processing and you open up a world of possibility for video games that no other company can match. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-24-google-is-making-a-spectrum-of-bets-on-stadia-content">Jade Raymond</a>, Google VP and head of Stadia Games &amp; Entertainment, envisions leveraging Google’s sophistication in AI to create games that “that wouldn’t be possible on any other platform.” She mentions using Google’s Duplex technology to replace scripted conversations with NPCs with naturalistic conversation that responds adaptively to what the player says. Think about what this could mean for games that feature developing relationships among the player’s character and a party of NPCs.</p>
      <p>Fluid and natural conversation with NPCs would be a huge change but we can imagine much more. For example, think about what Google’s advanced machine learning algorithms could bring to enemy AI. Enemies could adapt to the tactics employed by the population of players in multiplayer games or those favored by individuals in single player games. Game worlds in multiplayer games could change in real time in response to what players are doing. When something significant is happening in the game, a map driven by Google Maps could show you where it is and tell you how to get there. You could have conversations with an in-game version of the Google Assistant armed with deep knowledge of the game and what you’ve done so far. The possibilities are endless.</p>

        <b>The Bad</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stadia must survive and prosper in order to reach its game-changing potential because that potential won’t be realized at launch. Surviving isn’t guaranteed, however, because Stadia faces obstacles stemming from the state of internet technology and the service’s disappointing launch.</p>
      <p>Stadia promises to stream 4K games at 60 frames per second with HDR and 5.1 sound to desktops, laptops, tablets, phones and TVs. The data centers can do this but the internet service available to players may not be up to the task. High bandwidth game streaming depends on two things, download speed and latency. You can find out your internet speed and latency <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Stadia claims players will need a consistent download speed of 35 Mbps (Megabits per second) to play in 4K, 60 fps, HDR with 5.1 sound. Dropping to 20 Mbps reduces resolution to 1080p. 720p is the best you can do if your download speed lies between 10 and 20 Mbps and at this low bandwidth 5.1 sound is reduced to stereo.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index">Ookla’s Global Speed Index</a> estimates average fixed broadband download speed in the US at 129.65 Mbps. Players who get their internet from major providers like Verizon, Comcast and Cox should have no problem with download speed. Those with small local ISPs may have an issue.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Mobile is a different story. The Global Index estimates average mobile download speed in the US at 38.06 Mbps. That’s very close to the minimum Stadia says is needed for streaming 4K at 60 fps with HDR and 5.1 sound. If you’re planning on streaming Stadia to your TV using your phone and a Chromecast Ultra, you may be limited to 1080p or lower.</p>
      <p>Bandwidth is only half the story when it comes to streaming games. Latency is equally important. Latency (sometimes called ping) is the time it takes for data to travel from an input device to a server and back. If latency is high, there’s a noticeable delay between when the player issues a command using the controller and when the game responds. Games where timing is critical such as  shooters and racing games demand low latency. They quickly become unplayable if latency is high.</p>
      <p>How high is too high? Latencies of 20ms (milliseconds) or lower are good for any kind of game. Problems begin to appear between 20 and 100ms. Timing-critical games are not fun the closer you get to 100ms. The fun drains out of other kinds of games between 100 and 150ms. If latency is over 150ms it’s pretty much game over.</p>
      <p>How does Stadia handle latency? Oddly, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/06/07/google-avoided-a-critical-detail-about-streaming-during-its-stadia-livestream/#1bb8d84e6cc1">Google had nothing to say about latency</a> when it hyped its technology during a Stadia livestream in June. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/making-of-google-stadia/">Games Radar</a>, Madj Bakar, Stadia's VP of Engineering, talked about solving latency problems by changing the speed at which a game streams. He claimed this could be done by using machine learning to predict both latencies and player actions. He also claimed it would take a year or two for the system to produce effective results. If it works, that would be great, but Stadia is launching now. Latency may be a big problem.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Stadia’s survival is also threatened by its bungled launch. Launch problems began to surface when Google let it be known that most early adopters who forked over $129 for Stadia’s Founders Edition would not be getting their hardware package in time for launch. Preorders will ship in the order in which they were received with some players reporting their delivery is estimated to arrive weeks after launch.</p>
      <p>The next disappointment arrived when Stadia announced that only 12 games would be available at launch. Many pointed out that quite a few of these games are a year or more old, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/11/13/launch-titles-provide-a-good-test-of-whether-stadia-can-fulfill-its-promises/#4401149f4985">I’ve noted elsewhere</a> that at least two of them, <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> and <i>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</i>, are very well suited to testing Stadia’s claim that it severs the connection between the technical quality of a game and the limitations of a player’s hardware. Two days before launch Stadia moved to counter this disappointment when it added 10 additional games to the launch list.</p>
      <p>The final disappointment came during a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) when Stadia revealed that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/11/16/stadia-vs-xcloud-xbox-flips-the-script-on-its-disastrous-2013-e3/#53078c4c6ca6">many promised features will be absent at launch</a>. A centerpiece of the Stadia marketing push was that high-tech gaming would be available on a wide range of devices but it turns out that 4K streaming will only be possible on TVs when Stadia launches. You need a Chromecast Ultra to stream to your 4K TV but the Ultra you already own won’t work. It needs a firmware update that Google hasn’t gotten around to rolling out yet. Stadia will track game Achievements, but the player won’t be able to see them because the UI isn’t finished. Buddy Passes to share with your friends won’t be included in the initial package. Multiplayer and social components such as Steam Connect, State Share and Crowd Play aren’t there. Family sharing also isn’t there so each family member will have to buy their own game.</p>
      <p>Stadia sold a feature rich product launching in 2019 but what it’s providing looks more like a very expensive beta test.</p>

        <b>The Ugly</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stadia has great potential, but it also faces great obstacles. The ugly part of this story is that Google itself is responsible for many of the obstacles that threaten Stadia’s survival.</p>
      <p>There’s no excuse for failing to get Founder’s Edition buyers their hardware package on launch day. Other gaming companies large and small manage to deliver consoles and games on launch day to buyers who preorder. But Google, with all the resources at its disposal, couldn’t get it together. Mismanagement at this level does not bode well for Stadia.</p>
      <p>Stadia’s whittled down launch can be explained and excused as an example of Google’s typical practice of rolling out new products and features slowly in order to correct problems as they appear within a limited pool of users. That’s a good policy and a good argument but if Google planned to handle the Stadia rollout they way it handles others, it should have made that clear from the beginning. Instead, Stadia was sold as a feature-rich streaming service that brings high-tech gaming to a variety of devices. The Stadia that’s launching isn’t close to that and the extent to which Stadia falls short wasn’t fully revealed until the week before launch. Google’s enthusiastic pre-launch hype about Stadia now looks like a ploy to lure people into buying the expensive Founder’s Edition. Do you think the Founder’s Edition would have sold as well as it did if people were told at the outset their $129 was going to buy what Stadia is actually delivering?</p>
      <p>Stadia’s launch is taking place under a cloud that Google is responsible for creating. Many who may have been intrigued by Stadia’s promises are likely to be wary because of Stadia’s performance. If people now find their games are unplayable because of latency problems or have to be played at low resolutions because of bandwidth issues, Stadia could be in trouble. Why buy a game from Google when you can play the same game with possibly better performance and graphics and more multiplayer and social support on consoles or PC? Why believe Stadia will survive long enough to realize its full potential when it handled its launch so poorly? How long will it take Stadia to overcome the perception left by the launch that it’s not ready for prime time?</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Remember Google Glass?<cite>Google</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>These questions point to another factor that may lead to Google being ultimately responsible if Stadia doesn’t survive. Google has a consistent history of abruptly abandoning promising projects that don’t fulfill initial expectations. If Stadia gets off to a slow start, how long will Google stick with it before it pulls the plug? Will people buy games from Google when Stadia is not what it was supposed to be and they know Stadia could be dropped like a hot rock if it doesn’t meet expectations?</p>
      <p>Stadia is walking a tightrope. I hope it reaches safety because its potential to take gaming to another level is so great. I’m afraid it’s going to fall.</p>
