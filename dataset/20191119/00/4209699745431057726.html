      <p>Four years after returning $12,200 of a passenger found in one of the toilets at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, the Nigerian Government on Tuesday rewarded a cleaner, Mrs Josephine Ugwu, with an apartment and an award for her honesty.</p>
      <p>The government said it gave Ugwu the apartment and award in recognition of her integrity in the discharge of her duties.</p>
      <p>Recall that Ugwu, a staff of a cleaning company at the Lagos Airport, in 2015 found $12,200, which a passenger forgot inside a toilet in the facility and returned it to security officials at the airport.</p>
      <p>About two years ago, the Lagos State House of Assembly recognised her with an award and gifts, while several other organisations also applauded her honesty.</p>
      <p>The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria offered her a job in one of its departments, Aviation Security.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday in Abuja, Ugwu had a handshake with President Muhammadu Buhari where she received an award.</p>
      <p>A statement by the General Manager, Corporate Communications, FAAN, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, said, “Ugwu was subsequently given automatic employment by the authority in recognition of her honesty and exemplary conducts.</p>
      <p>“She was given a brand new apartment in Lagos for her act of honesty and integrity.”</p>
