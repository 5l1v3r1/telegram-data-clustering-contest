      <h1>Improved Outdoor Solar Harvester Now Handles All The Parts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/dp2cnk/" target="_blank">Donald Papp</a></address>
      <p>[Vadim Panov]’s 3D printed solar harvester is in effect a rechargeable outdoor battery, and the real challenge he faced when designing it was having it handle the outdoors reliably. The good news is that part is solved, and <a href="https://www.shortn0tes.com/2019/09/solar-harvester-v2.html">his newest design</a> is now also flexible enough to handle a variety of common and economical components such as different battery connectors, charge controllers, and solar panel sizes. All that’s left is to set it up using the GoPro-style mounting clamp and let it soak up those solar rays.</p>
      <p>We saw <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/09/soak-up-the-sun-with-this-3d-printed-solar-harvester/">his first version</a> earlier this year, which uses inventive and low-cost solutions for weatherproofing like coating the 3D print with epoxy (the new version makes this easier and less messy, by the way.) It was a fine design, but only worked with one specific solar panel size and one specific configuration of parts. His newest version makes a few mechanical improvements and accommodates a wide variety of different components and solar panel sizes. The CAD files are all available on <a href="https://github.com/panovvv/solar-harvester">the GitHub repository</a> but he’s conveniently provided STL files for about a dozen common sizes.</p>
      <p>When it comes to harvesting light, staying indoors offers less power but requires a far less rugged setup. If that interests you, be sure to check out the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/08/12/tiny-solar-energy-module-tsem-brings-big-performance/">Tiny Solar Energy Module (TSEM)</a> which can scrape up even indoor light.</p>
