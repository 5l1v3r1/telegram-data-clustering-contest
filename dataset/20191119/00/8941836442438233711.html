      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico’s largest city is adding more homicide detectives as it nears a record number of killings seen in a year.</p>
      <p>KOB-TV reports the Albuquerque Police Department is preparing to hire more homicide detectives after Mayor Tim Keller doubled the number when he took office in 2017.</p>
      <p>The city of Albuquerque is two killings away from tying its deadliest year ever with 72 homicides.</p>
      <p>FBI statistics show Albuquerque had a violent crime rate of 1,365 per 100,000 residents in 2018. The national rate was about 369 violent crimes per 100,000 residents that year.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the country of Uruguay issued a warning to its citizens about traveling to Albuquerque.</p>
