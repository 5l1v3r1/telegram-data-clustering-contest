      <p>In the latest episode of the Huawei ban, the US Commerce Department has granted another 3-month extension to Huawei’s temporary general license which now extends through February 16, 2020. This means Huawei is free to continue business with American companies for components that “do not pose a threat to national security”.</p>

      <p>More specifically, the document from the Commerce Department states the new temporary license allows Huawei to resume limited operations in the networks and equipment sector alongside its efforts in mobile services and cybersecurity research. This is now the third extension given to Huawei since the company was initially put on the Entity List back in May.</p>
      <blockquote>This temporary general license authorizes certain activities, including those necessary for the continued operations of existing networks and equipment as well as the support of existing mobile services, including cybersecurity research critical to maintaining the integrity and reliability of existing and fully operational networks and equipment.</blockquote>
      <p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross further clarified in a press release statement that the new temporary license will help smaller carriers in remote US areas who use Huawei telecommunications equipment to continue their service.</p>
