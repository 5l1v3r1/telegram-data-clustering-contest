(AP) - Schools in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bristol/">Bristol</a>, Tennessee, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bristol/">Bristol</a>, Virginia, upped security after a vague threat about bringing a gun to a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bristol/">Bristol</a> school was posted online over the weekend.</p>
