      <p>Member of Parliament for New Juaben South, Mark Assibey Yeboah, has told NDC MPs that the NPP will not allow their party to return to power in 2020 to ‘send the country backwards economically’.</p>
      <p>According to him, the NPP’s performance under President Akufo-Addo has placed the nation ‘in a much better’ fiscal deficit in terms of socio-economic transformation.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want any reversibility so we decided to pass the Fiscal Responsibility Act to check budget spending and if we want to put 2020 into a proper perspective, the NPP is going into 2020 knowing very well that the fiscal deficit will not exceed 5 percent, unlike the NDC, did in 2004 where the deficit was 2.2 percent,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mark Assibey Yeboah made this known to Members of Parliament on Monday, November 18, during the parliamentary debate on the 2020 Budget and Economic Policy in Accra.</p>
      <p>He however reiterated that the Fiscal Advisory Council put in place by the Akufo-Addo led administration will ensure that there is no irreversibility in terms of socio-economic transformation by any incoming governments.</p>
