"Wishing my favorite teenager a very happy 15th birthday!!!" Jennifer captioned a photo of her and Natasha hugging in front of a gold-covered birthday cake and a tray of pink doughnuts â€” what a fun party!</p>
      <p>Natasha, or Tashi, as J Lo refers to the 15-year-old in photo captions, wore a beautiful red dress and was all smiles as she celebrated the momentous birthday.
