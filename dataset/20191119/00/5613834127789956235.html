      <p>While Valve still can’t quite count to three, they will be returning to the <b><i>Half-Life</i></b> series in the form of their first VR game! <b><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i></b> will be revealed at 10 am PT/1 pm ET on November 21. On top of that, according to a leaked transcript from a new interview, <i>Alyx</i> will be shown at this year’s Game Awards on December 12!</p>

      <p>It’s quite the coincidence, since this month marks the 15th anniversary of <b><i>Half-Life 2</i></b>‘s release. And while we never did get that closure in the form of <i>Episode 3</i>, perhaps Valve is leaving that to <i>Alyx</i>?</p>
