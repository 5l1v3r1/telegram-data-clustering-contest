      <p>Ontario spent $231 million last year to tear up over 750 renewable energy contracts.</p>
      <p>Associate Energy Minister Bill Walker defended the cost today, blaming the previous Liberal government for signing the deals while the province had an oversupply of electricity.</p>
      <p>The Progressive Conservative government cancelled the contracts last July, just weeks after winning the provincial election.</p>
      <p>The government said the cancellations would save ratepayers $790-million – a figure industry officials have disputed.</p>
      <p>At the time, the government also said it would introduce legislation that would protect hydro consumers from any costs incurred from the cancellation.</p>
      <p>Walker says today provincial taxpayers will foot the bill for the cancelled contracts, not hydro customers.</p>
