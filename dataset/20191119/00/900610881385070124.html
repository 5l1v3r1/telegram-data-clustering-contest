      <h1>ANA is introducing a selection of global wines to its premier cabins and lounges</h1>

      <p>All Nippon Airways (ANA) will begin rolling out several new wines starting in December for its business class and first class passengers travelling on international flights as well as passengers travelling domestically in the airline’s <a href="https://www.ana.co.jp/en/jp/serviceinfo/domestic/inflight/guide/premiumclass/seat/">Premium Class</a>.</p>
      <p>“With favourites from Europe, Australia, North America and Japan, we are confident that all passengers will be able to find the ideal wine that perfectly appeals to their preferences,” said Hideki Kunugi, executive vice president of ANA.</p>
      <p>The new wines will be available both in-flight and in select ANA lounges at Narita International Airport and Haneda Airport.</p>
      <p>Here’s a list of ANA’s new wines and details about which routes they will be offered on:</p>
      <h3>International first class</h3>
      <p><b>Château Cos d’Estournel 2008</b> is already available on European routes, but those flying on North American routes will get a chance to try the new wine in December this year.</p>
      <p><b>Solaris Shinshu Chikumagawa Merlot 2016</b> will be offered to passengers travelling on European routes from June until November 2020. It’s already available on its international first class cabin on North American routes in September.</p>
      <h3>International business class</h3>
      <p><b>Quinta de la Rosa Finest Reserve Port</b> will be available on North American and European routes from December 2019.</p>
      <p><b>Skuttlebutt Sauvignon Blanc Semillon 2018</b> will be offered on North American, European, Mexican and Oceanian routes from December 2019.</p>
      <h3>Domestic premium class wine</h3>
      <p><b>Champagne HATON Brut Réserve</b> will be available on Japan domestic Premium Class routes between Haneda and Itami, Sapporo (New Chitose), Fukuoka, and Okinawa (Naha), from January 2020.</p>
      <p>The <b>Beaujolais Village Nouveau 2019 Vieille</b> will be offered at the International ANA Suite Lounge at Narita Airport, and the international and domestic ANA Suite Lounges at Haneda Airport, whilst the <b>2019 Beaujolais Village Nouveau</b> will be offered at Haneda Airport in the International ANA Lounge.</p>
      <p>The airline said 62 of its wines come from 15 different countries. These were all selected through a six month process, with input from sommelier Olivier Poussier and Conrad Tokyo executive sommelier Satoru Mori. The team started with approximately 2,000 potential wines before narrowing the selection down to 62 wines, based on whether they would pair well with ANA’s in-flight meals. Many of these wines have already been introduced to the airline’s premier cabins. The airline started serving the <b>Tourelle de Tholomies Colombard Sauvignon ANA Original Wine</b> on international premium economy and economy class cabins on all routes from August this year.</p>
