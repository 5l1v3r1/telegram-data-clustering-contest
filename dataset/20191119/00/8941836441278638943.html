      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - The rideshare company <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lyft/">Lyft</a> is planning to end service to and from Phoenix <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sky-harbor/">Sky Harbor</a> International Airport in January over proposed fee increases.</p>
      <p>The current fee is $2.66 for pickup only.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Phoenix City Council voted to charge companies such as Uber and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lyft/">Lyft</a> a $4 fee for each ride to and from the airport starting in 2020.</p>
      <p>The rate would increase 25 cents each year until it reaches $5 for pick-up and $5 for drop off by 2024.</p>
      <p>In a letter to the Phoenix Aviation Department, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lyft/">Lyft</a> executive Bakari Block says the company is obligated to prevent the unfair penalization of their drivers and riders by ceasing operations at the airport beginning in January.</p>
