      <p>PEACHTREE CORNERS, Ga. (AP) — Growth and urbanization, along with President Donald Trump’s struggles among previously GOP-leaning white college graduates, have put Georgia on the cusp of presidential battleground status.</p>
      <p>The question is how close.</p>
      <p>Republicans acknowledge demographic change but are skeptical the state will swing to Democrats.</p>
      <p>As with any competitive electorate, Georgia’s direction will turn on a combination of variables within an electorate that now exceeds 7 million registered voters.</p>
      <p>The 2020 elections offer plenty of opportunities for both sides to prove their case.</p>
      <p>Georgia will play host to this month’s Democratic presidential debate, featuring 10 candidates. It is being held Wednesday at actor Tyler Perry’s Atlanta film complex.</p>
