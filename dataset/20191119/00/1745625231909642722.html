      <p>When Lydia is revealed to be alive, Gamma realizes that Alpha has been lying all along in 'The Walking Dead.'</p>
      <p><b>SPOILER ALERT:</b> This article discusses Episode 7 (titled “Open Your Eyes”) of AMC’s <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/the-walking-dead/"><i>The Walking Dead</i></a> Season 10. Please proceed with caution if you have not yet viewed this episode and wish to avoid spoilers.</p>
      <p>Episode 7 of AMC’s <i>The Walking Dead</i> saw Carol (Melissa McBride) use Lydia (Cassady McClincy) as a way in which to prove to the Whisperers that their leader, Alpha (Samantha Morton), is lying to them. As <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/17/walking-dead-open-your-eyes-siddiq-dante/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> points out, because of this, Gamma (Thora Birch) has been shaken by the revelation that Lydia is still alive.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5728280/the-walking-dead-season-10-alpha-gamma/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, Alpha requested that Gamma act as a double-agent and befriend Aaron (Ross Marquand) in order to find out more information about Alexandria. Episode 7 saw this plan playing out as Aaron tried hard to befriend the Whisperer and show her that life at Alexandria was better than Alpha was saying.</p>
      <p>While it seemed like Aaron was getting through to Gamma, by the end of the episode, Gamma pulled a knife on Aaron and threatened to kill him unless he revealed more information about Alexandria. Luckily for Aaron, though, Carol chose that moment to appear with Lydia and, as a result of this, Gamma discovers that Lydia is still alive.</p>
      <p>Previously, in <i>The Walking Dead</i>, Alpha had told the Whisperers that she had killed Lydia rather than have her betray their group by joining Alexandria. It was because of this belief that Gamma <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5692547/the-walking-dead-season-10-gamma-sister-backstory/">killed her own sister</a> after she attacked Alpha and was shown to be untrustworthy.</p>

      <p><i>The Walking Dead</i>‘s showrunner, Angela Kang, recently discussed the moment when Gamma realized that she had been lied to by Alpha.</p>
      <p>“This is a huge moment for Gamma, and it certainly is going to turn her story in a way,” Kang told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>.</p>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <blockquote>“For somebody who was such a true believer — who went so far as killing her sister to save her leader — she now realizes that everything she believes is wrong.”</blockquote>
      <p>As to how this will shape Gamma’s story moving forward into the mid-season finale next Sunday night remains to be seen. Kang would not reveal any further details regarding this storyline as she considered anything she said as being “too spoiler-y.” This means that viewers will just have to tune into future episodes in order to find out more about Gamma’s reaction to Alpha’s betrayal.</p>
      <p>Season 10 of <i>The Walking Dead</i> returns to AMC on Sunday, November 24 with the mid-season finale. Episode 8 is titled “The World Before.”</p>
