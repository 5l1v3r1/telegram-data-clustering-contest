      <p>We are experiencing what I call the “global teach in on narcissism.” Collectively, there is massive <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> about the threats that a narcissist poses, reflected in the popularity and frequency of Psychology Today posts on the subject (examples in the image below). Google searches for “narcissism” reached a peak in February 2017, right after the inauguration of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/president-donald-trump">President Trump</a>, but interest has been growing for years. The research of psychologists Campbell and Twenge resulted in 2009’s Narcissism Epidemic, revealing a peak of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder">Narcissistic Personality</a> Inventory scores in college-age students by 2009 (which dropped down to early 1990s levels by 2015).</p>
      <p>Narcissism is a fundamental question of the human psyche – am I for myself or others, and what is the balance? All major religions urge us to strive mightily against the self-centered ego, and advocate the golden rule: “Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you.” There is a healthy range of narcissism. Having too little or too much self-love, though, is unhealthy for self and others.</p>

      <p>Grandiose views of self, devaluation of others, lack of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/empathy">empathy</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gaslighting">gaslighting</a> (distorting facts and insisting on blind obedience to one’s own view of reality) – all in service to the ego of the narcissist – pose clear and present dangers to relationships. A narcissist without <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ethics-and-morality">conscience</a>, restraints, checks or balances can easily become an authoritarian or sociopath, insisting that they are not beholden to laws or responsible to their relationships, organization, community or even country as a whole. All that matters is unbridled power and winning antagonistically against others. This strategy is demonstrably disastrous for relationships, organizations, countries and the world, as borne out in countless historical examples. The needs, feelings, and thoughts of others are deemed unimportant as they are subordinated to the ego of the narcissist. Power becomes superior to compassion, kindness, and mutual relationship. As a psychiatrist, I maintain compassion for the narcissist. Their interpersonal turbulence indicates the turbulence, insecurity, precarity – or sometimes paucity – of their inner lives. Compassion cannot condone the abuse of power, though, whether it’s by a patient, doctor, religious leader, politician or president. To uphold both the rules of relatedness and the rule of law, there should be no positions of power in our country - only positions of responsibility. True mutuality in relationships is only possible when grounded in the equality of our common humanity.</p>

      <p>No one of us is perfect. We become better people by being related and accountable to each other. When we make ourselves dependable in relationships, by being responsive and responsible to the needs of others, even the needs of the whole, we create trust, stability and increasing security in the changing fortunes of time. Love, by my definition, is concern for the growth, well-being, and care of another person. This can be a joyous process of learning, growth, and renewal, as relationships are central to personal and societal <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a>.</p>
      <p>The founders of the nation engaged in debate about the role of the executive and the balance of powers between the three branches of government. These can be viewed as a debate between the power of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/narcissism">narcissistic</a> authoritarianism vs. the restraint of such power. Alexander Hamilton argued for a lifetime term for the president, in effect an “American King.” He lost this argument to James Madison and others, who wished to guard against the darker, selfish nature of individuals and executives with the check of the legislative and judicial branches.</p>
      <p>Madison wrote in 1795:</p>
      <blockquote>“In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended…No nation could reserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare… These truths are well established. They are read in every page which records the progression from a less arbitrary to a more arbitrary government, or the transition from a popular government to an aristocracy or a monarchy.”<br/>and<br/>“the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. [The Constitution] has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the Legislature.”</blockquote>
      <p>Over the last 70 years, though, the Executive has become more powerful. Congress has not officially declared war since World War II, and has instead opted for what might be considered more politically expedient appropriations and authorizations for military action, essentially deferring to the President and the Executive branch. This has been sanctioned by both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>
      <p>The Executive has been advanced as an above-the-law authoritarian in disturbing ways. President Nixon famously agreed with his counsel that “if the president does it, by definition, it is not illegal.” Ed Meese, counselor to President Reagan, and Dick Cheney, ranking Republican on the House Select Committee investigating the Iran Contra fiasco, advocated for essentially unlimited Executive power. More recently, now Attorney General William Barr opined that the president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice, because that threat of prosecution would throttle presidential power. Presidential authority regarding law enforcement, in Barr’s view, is “illimitable.”</p>
      <p>What we have, psychologically, is a powerful state fearful of “obstacles” to unfettered power. Has a “government of the people, by the people, and for the people” perished from the Earth, contrary to Abraham Lincoln’s lofty words at Gettysburg? Has a political party become beholden to the ego and power of the Executive rather than the requirement to uphold and defend the laws and Constitution of the United States?</p>
      <p>This is what is playing out right now on Capitol Hill. Should any modern president be held accountable for his actions by Congress and the Courts, or have we abandoned that idea altogether in favor of using rhetoric, spin, and media manipulation to blast stories that gin up our base and rile our opposition?</p>
      <p>As a psychiatrist and humanitarian, it is deeply disturbing to see the Republican party and president using the powers of office to advocate for perpetual war against immigrants, refugees, Democrats, and anyone who dares to disagree with them. It’s a disastrous strategy, and a horrible model for the discourse of a democracy. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. "Admit nothing, deny everything, and make counteraccusations" is a template for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sociopathy">sociopathy</a>, not democracy.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the primitive wish for absolute power and purview that is at the core of narcissistic striving is at odds with relationships, democracy, and well-being.</p>
      <p>But we must have this debate, not only on Capitol Hill, but in every living room, college campus, and meeting hall in this incredible nation that is in pain and distress. As distressed as I am about the state of the American psyche, a part of me is <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">grateful</a> to President Trump for bringing the fundamental questions of ego, power, abuse, and love for fellow man to the forefront of our national conversation.</p>
      <p>A lot’s at stake.</p>
