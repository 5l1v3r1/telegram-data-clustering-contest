      <p>Following the success of its get-out- the-vote effort in the 2018 midterm elections, <a href="https://plus1thevote.com/">MTV announced today</a> that it was launching a larger <u>+1 the Vote</u> campaign to mobilize young people to register and vote in the upcoming 2020 election.The campaign will have several components, and MTV plans to use all its platforms - liner, digital, social and live programs - to emphasize the importance of voting, especially to its target audience of Gen Z and Millennials. It’s a big jump from MTV’s first foray into a voter turnout effort - <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/about-us/#ourhistory">“Rock the Vote</a>” - back in 1990.</p>
      <p>A prize property of Viacom, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/">MTV</a> has evolved over the years from a TV show featuring music videos and celebrity video jockeys in the 1980s to a global media operation that currently includes multiple TV shows, films and live events.</p>
      <p>According to the media accompanying the launch, MTV projects that four million people will turn 18 between now and the 2020 election. The <u>+1 the vote</u> effort will target this group as well as all first-time voters with a year-long campaign to make voting a priority. As the campaign name suggests, it will capitalize on the well-known phenomena of today’s young people to share all aspects of their lives with friends through social media - in this case, turning voting into a social activity.</p>
      <p>MTV will partner with several organizations - such as <a href="https://www.democracy.works/">Democracy Works</a>, <a href="https://www.studentslearnstudentsvote.org/">Students Learn Student Vote</a>, <a href="https://www.allianceforyouthorganizing.org/">Alliance For Youth Organizing</a> and <a href="https://www.whenweallvote.org/">When We All Vote</a> - to boost the reach of the program. The strategy is multi-pronged and will feature the following components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>+1 AMBASSADORS:</b> MTV will partner with artists who will be voting in their first Presidential election to inspire their fans to register and vote. </li>
        <li><b>+1 THE SHOWS:</b> With the help of civic engagement experts, MTV has developed a workshop to help content creators integrate voting messages into their programming. MTV is working with Creative Artists Agency’s Foundation to make the training widely available.</li>
        <li><b>+1 THE PROMS:</b> Partnering with When We All Vote, <a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/?utm_campaign=rtr_ad%7CGoogle%7CBranded%7CA1%7CExact&amp;utm_source=google&amp;sem_cid=671389825&amp;sem_gid=36582386840&amp;pxid=kwd-14712302752&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=rent%20the%20runway&amp;sem_type=e&amp;em_stream=&amp;r_ty=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7fzg27H25QIVIB-tBh2TpAQ3EAAYASAAEgLBlvD_BwE">Rent the Runway</a>, artists, and other brands, MTV will sponsor high school proms that include registration drives as part of the event.</li>
        <li><b>+1 THE LINES:</b> Teaming up with <a href="https://www.headcount.org/">HeadCount</a>, MTV will register first-time voters in line at MTV events like the VMAs, Movie &amp; TV Awards, SnowGlobe, and tapings of from <i>Wild N’ Out</i> to<i> Singled Out</i>.</li>
        <li><b>+1 THE POLLS:</b> In partnership with several voting-promotion organizations, MTV will launch a national effort to open polling sites in county jails and on college campuses, giving voters easier access to the polls. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The voting rate among U.S. college students more than doubled from the 2014 to the 2018 federal midterm elections. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/09/24/college-students-take-to-the-voting-booth/#31eef023253e">Several factors appeared to push the college student voting surge,</a> and MTV attributes at least some of the increase to its get-out-the-vote campaign in 2018.</p>
      <p>First, <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2018g">voter turnout for all age groups was up in the 2018 midterms</a>, but the well-known gap between the high voting rate of older voters and the typically spotty turnout of young voters shrank considerably.</p>
      <p>Second, many campuses have renewed an emphasis on civic learning and community engagement by students, with voting being promoted as the most fundamental duty of citizenship.</p>
      <p>A final stimulant is Donald Trump, who is <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/409722-young-people-who-came-of-political-age-during-trump-likely-to">overwhelmingly opposed by 18-to-24-year olds</a>. The U.S. political environment has become more polarized, and college students have been drawn increasingly into the fray, predominantly to the benefit of Democrat candidates. This fact has not been lost on conservative lawmakers, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/09/20/massive-surge-college-student-voting-2018">who have tried in some states to jimmy the dates of special elections or limit early voting on campuses</a>.</p>
      <p>MTV’s campaign bears watching because it has the promise to help turn out the youth vote at a level we have not seen before, and if 2018 is any indication, political candidates will need to pay much greater attention to young voters in 2020. Candidates who ignore this population do so at their peril. Who knows: “I want my MTV” may morph from a famous Dire Straits refrain to the new plea of political candidates waking up to an ever-more-empowered voter bloc.</p>
