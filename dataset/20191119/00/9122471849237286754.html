      <h1>Alabama 4-Star Freshman CB Will Enter Transfer Portal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:58:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Alabama football lost a four-star freshman on Monday night when four-star cornerback Scooby Carter announced he is entering his name in the NCAA transfer portal.</p>
      <p>Carter was one of the top-100 prospects in the 2019 class, according to 247Sports’ Composite Rankings. He announced the news of his transfer on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Here’s a bit of what he had to say in his announcement:</p>
      <blockquote>“First I would like to thank the University of Alabama and the coaches for helping me and allowing me to play the sport I love … But after talking with my family I believe it is best for me to rethink my decision and enter my name into the transfer portal.”</blockquote>

      <p>The timing of the transfer is certainly interesting. Carter did not travel with the team to play Mississippi State last Saturday due to a reported suspension for missing class. It’s unclear as to whether or not that’s the motivation to transfer.</p>
      <p>Carter played in just three games for Alabama this season recording one tackle. He was a reserve for the Crimson Tide and didn’t see the field too often.</p>
      <p>The 2019 four-star CB committed to Oklahoma and Texas A&amp;M before choosing Nick Saban and Alabama. It would come as no surprise if both schools are possible transfer destinations.</p>
