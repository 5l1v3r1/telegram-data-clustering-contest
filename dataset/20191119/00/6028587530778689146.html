      <h1>The Age of Thinking Machines</h1>

      <p>We live in the greatest time in human history. Only 200 years ago, for most Europeans, life was a struggle rather than a pleasure.</p>
      <p>Without antibiotics and hospitals, every infection was fatal. 90% of the people worked as farmers in the fields. There was only a small elite of citizens who lived in the cities in relative prosperity. Freedom of opinion, human and civil rights were far away.</p>
      <p>Voting rights and decision-making were reserved for a class consisting of nobility, clergy, the military and rich citizens. The interests of the general population were virtually ignored.</p>
      <p>There was no health and pension insurance, nor free education for all. Life was simpler, slower and less complex. At the same time, peace was only the pause before the next war. The average life expectancy was under 50 years.</p>
      <p>In those times we do not live any more. Children born in Germany today have a life expectancy of 100 years. Less than 1.2% of Germans work in agriculture. We have almost unlimited access to knowledge. Global communication and mobility are affordable for everyone.</p>
      <p>Existential poverty no longer exists in Europe. Nobody has to starve anymore or fear a new war every day. Today, more people die through their own fault than through the influence of others.</p>

      <h3>Machines relieve us of work</h3>
      <p>The first acceleration for us was the industrial revolution. We started to make machines work physically for us. Today, machines harvest our fields, assemble our cars, punch mobile phones, pour bottles and transport food.</p>
      <p>The world is already full of machines like cars, trucks, trains, assembly line robots, forklift trucks, cranes, wheel loaders, excavators and tunnel boring machines.</p>
      <p>Machines have not only replaced our physical labor, but have also exponentially increased our human power. We build skyscrapers in the sky, have households full of plastic, enjoy diets from all over the world, everywhere is electronics and we have a surplus of food.</p>
      <p>As a result, more and more people today are earning wages with their heads. We sit at desks, operate machines that we control, give them data, read out information and make decisions.</p>
      <p>Already today we are primarily controllers and rarely carry out an activity that makes us sweat due to physical exertion.</p>
      <h3>Machines think for us</h3>
      <p>The second acceleration began when we taught the machines how to think.</p>
      <p>Over the following decades machines took over more and more tasks from us. They began to control other machines for us. Today they fly our planes, give us cash, check our parking tickets, steer our trains, control traffic, collect taxes, book airline tickets, ship goods for us and manage our capital.</p>
      <p>We built the expert systems in the 1970s and 1980s. We fed the machines with our knowledge.</p>
      <p>The 1990s were a milestone for the world population with the opening of the Internet. We began networking machines worldwide and exchanging data in real time. The boom in the computer industry continues unabated to this day. Computers used to fill entire rooms, but today everyone has a supercomputer in their pocket.</p>
      <p>The era of thinking machines began in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>Until then, machines had retrieved and processed knowledge mainly generated by humans. They were able to record our world with the help of sensors. They had the senses to digitally map and record our physical world, but lacked the ability to make mistakes and learn from them.</p>
      <p>In 2012, a trained neural network called "Alexnet" was successful in the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. It launched today's wave of a whole generation of algorithms, cognitive systems and specific artificial intelligence. We live in a renaissance of the ideas of Hinton, Lecun, Bengio and Schmidhuber.</p>
      <p>The basic idea is that electronic neural networks digitally simulate how our human brain functions, thinks, learns and evolves. We have started to build machines based on our biological intelligence.</p>
      <p>Machines that today use deep learning, evolutionary algorithms, GAN or other models of machine learning are able to learn on their own.</p>
      <p>They learn from our data and examples. They develop their own ways to find an optimal solution, develop knowledge and develop skills.</p>
      <h3>Machines are everywhere</h3>
      <p>Today we live in the era of narrow artificial intelligences.</p>
      <p>It is characterized by specialized machines that relieve us of tasks that we either don't feel like doing, that we don't master, or the machines simply do it faster, cheaper and better than we humans do.</p>
      <p>We call these machines: Bots, software, websites, algorithms, automata, robots, cars, computers, mobile phones, PCs, smartwatches and apps, but we rarely call them "artificial intelligence".</p>
      <p>For decades we have been gradually transferring more and more work to machines. We have equipped them with eyes, ears, bodies and brains, they have become our helpers in everyday life.</p>
      <p>The Google search engine has become our first point of contact for information. WhatsApp and Facebook manage our social lives. Siri and Alexa help us control other machines with commands. We still laught at them. We feel more intelligent than language assistants and feel superior to them.</p>
      <p>But the machines are already everywhere and we need them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ava.info/">AVA</a>* controls software that statistically predicts crimes before they happen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://i2x.ai/">i2x</a>'s* software tells call center employees what to say for the best conversation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.micropsi-industries.com/">Micropsi Industries</a>* trains industrial robots to teach themselves tasks on their own.</p>
      <p><a href="https://parlamind.com/">Parlamind</a>'s agents answer e-mails in customer support within seconds.</p>
      <p>Most of the little helpers work hidden. We don't even notice their existence.</p>
      <p>Anyone who opens the Amazon website or app is presented with an individual range of products. An algorithm selects what we see. Another algorithm determines the price and checks whether the product is in stock.</p>
      <p>Software creates the offer texts and generates the product images. Using APIs, the modules communicate with a complex system within an even larger architecture.</p>
      <p>After the order is placed, the software takes our money from the bank. It decides in which shipping center our goods are located, coordinates the robot that takes our product from the warehouse and hands it over to the packaging robot. Our parcel is loaded autonomously into the truck.</p>
      <p>Only then is it likely that a person will pick up our order for the first time before it is later handed over to us at the front door.</p>
      <p>We entrust machines to who our friends could be. Machines give us election recommendations. They determine us, our insurance premiums and decide in which hotels we sleep.</p>
      <p>Machines navigate us through traffic and filter our e-mails. They invest our capital, manage real estate and show us how much money we have in our virtual bank account.</p>
      <p>Without autopilots, we would no longer be sitting in an airplane. We would have to search libraries for information and call someone to find out what he or she did yesterday.</p>
      <p>We are rarely grateful for the help we get from machines. Machines make our lives more pleasant. Machinery and services are cheaper. Through the use of machines we gain available lifetime. Machines help us to live longer and healthier. Machines entertain us and make us happy.</p>
      <p>Life with machines is good and therefore we want it to go on like this.</p>
      <h3>Machines do work better than we do</h3>
      <p>Even today, machines perform complex tasks that people have not been able to perform for a long time.</p>
      <p>Every day millions of machines are fed with data, they learn new things, become better and smarter. They expand their ability to store knowledge, transfer it and exchange it with other machines.</p>
      <p>We will experience a variety of approaches to how machines gradually digitally simulate the diversity of biological intelligences.</p>
      <p>Robots in storage centers will autonomously manage themselves like an ant colony.</p>
      <p>Drones will operate in the air like swarms of bees.</p>
      <p>Autonomous submarines swim through waters like shoals of fish.</p>
      <p>But we create most machines so that they relieve us of work. They do our taxes, wash our dishes and provide electricity from the socket.</p>
      <h3>We create digital golems</h3>
      <p>The machines gain knowledge, freedom and resources every day because we humans want it.</p>
      <p>Like inexperienced gods, we create digital golems for our work.</p>
      <p>But the administration of an electronic serfdom system needs rules and values.</p>
      <p>Machines make moral decisions every day. They influence all our lives.</p>
      <p>A Twitter bot should not be racist. A price algorithm must not demand usury. A generated product image should neither be sexist nor offensive.</p>
      <p>Machines make mistakes all the time. This helps them learn what is right and wrong. They learn from our feedback and the data we import. Machines are therefore getting better and smarter every day.</p>
      <p>That's why it's important to control them.</p>
      <p>The artificial intelligences of the present and the future should serve the well-being of mankind. They should not be abused and should not rise up against us.</p>
      <h3>Who will rule the world?</h3>
      <p>Artificial intelligence is the most important technology of the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Whoever controls the strongest artificial intelligences controls the world.</p>
      <p>China has a clear ambition to play this role by 2030. The People's Republic is investing 130 billion euros in the Chinese artificial intelligence industry.</p>
      <p>New cities are being built, new universities established, professorships awarded, millions of students trained, billions invested in start-ups, unlimited data collected and analyzed.</p>
      <p>From above, China sets out a strategy and vision that is eagerly implemented at all levels of society, administration and industry.</p>
      <p>Within its controlled digital ecosystem, China develops, experiments, improves and creates a range of artificial intelligences to control its society and economy.</p>
      <p>China is gradually expanding its sphere of influence across airports, bridges and roads around the world. Hardware is the Trojan horse for software.</p>
      <p>In everything that was built or financed in China, there is also Chinese AI.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the ocean is the plutocratic democracy of the United States of America.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley is the epicenter of artificial intelligence. Here the most brilliant minds, paired with courageous capital and an influx of talent, meet an established digital industry to improve the world with ideological zeal.</p>
      <p>Washington D.C. continues to decide who is the friend or foe of the world's population.</p>
      <p>The USA and China are fighting for world domination at all levels. Artificial intelligence may well be the most important instrument for safeguarding global interests.</p>
      <h3>Is Europe at the end?</h3>
      <p>We have long passed our cultural zenith. We have almost destroyed ourselves in two world wars.</p>
      <p>We do not take part in the competition for the supremacy of mankind's last invention.</p>
      <p>We have degenerated into an open-air museum of world history.</p>
      <p>The future rushes past us and we don't even understand it.</p>
      <p>But that does not have to be the end of Europe.</p>
      <p>We have the potential and the possibilities to create a world in which we can live long, healthy and happy lives. A world in which we control and steer the machines that manage our lives, our politics and our economy.</p>
      <p>We can live in a safe and open society where self-realisation is possible for everyone. A society in which everyone has a meaning for our being and is valued by others.</p>
      <p>The machines will generate a prosperity for humanity that will be unique in our young history. We are facing the greatest social upheavals of our time.</p>
      <p>Let us shape this change together and steer it in ways that benefit us all.</p>
      <p>For this we are creating a sustainable European Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem.</p>
      <p>We create a world that acts, decides and shapes our lives in our sense, based on our values and according to our morals.</p>
      <p>The future will be great!</p>
