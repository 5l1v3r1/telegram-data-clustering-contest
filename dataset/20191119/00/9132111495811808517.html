      <p>The Health Minister has hit back at critics who think the parked ambulances at the forecourt of the Parliament House are to score political points in 2020.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Kwaku Agyemang-Manu, the government is waiting for the full delivery and handing over of the ambulances to facilitate the distribution processes.</p>
      <p>“Nobody should think we are keeping the ambulances to deliver in 2020 because it is an election year and I think that is their pain. Nana Addo won the elections massively and doesn’t need these ambulances for Ghanaians to vote for him,” he said.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview on Adom FM’s Dwaso Nsem show, Mr Agyemang-Manu said the Akufo-Addo-led government is only following due processes and not to score political points.</p>
      <p>“There is no need to rush in getting the vehicles on the road because we still have a lot of documentation processes to undergo. The supplier is yet to hand over the documents and there is a pre-deliberate inspection which must go on at the side of the supplier and government,” he explained.</p>
      <p>The Minister called for the de-politicisation of the ambulance distribution because the Akufo-Addo-led government is more worried and concerned that emergency services in Ghana are not up to standard.</p>
