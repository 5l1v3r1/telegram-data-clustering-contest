      <h1>LVMH targets tourist shoppers with revamp of historic Paris store</h1>

      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury goods group LVMH aims to grab a greater slice of tourist spending in Paris as of next April when it relaunches La Samaritaine, a 150-year-old department store that will house a hotel and shops and rival the likes of Galeries Lafayette.</p>
      <p>Spending by visitors to France remains a major source of income for high-end brands, even if Chinese shoppers, the industry's number one clientele, are starting to buy more at home, encouraged by import duty cuts among other incentives.</p>
      <p>LVMH, behind fashion and accessories labels like Louis Vuitton, makes 8% of its sales in France alone, and already owns upmarket Parisian department store Le Bon Marche.</p>
      <p>Its latest venture, with 20,000 square meters of shopping space, will sit on the banks of the Seine, close to tourist magnets like Notre-Dame Cathedral.</p>
      <p>La Samaritaine is famed for its 1920-era building and gilded Art Deco facade but the revamped store will include a 100-metre airport-style moving walkway through a tunnel to nearby parking.</p>
      <p>"The environment in Paris is very competitive, we had to differentiate ourselves," Eleonore de Boysson, the Europe and Middle East head of DFS Group said in a presentation on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>DFS is a retail and airport duty-free group which is majority-owned by LVMH and primarily present in Asia, including Hong Kong, where operations have been hit by street protests.</p>
      <p>Facing competition from online retailers, department stores are reinventing themselves as day-trip destinations.</p>
      <p>La Samaritaine, which expects just under 5 million visitors in its first year, will rival peers like Qatari-controlled Printemps and family-owned Galeries Lafayette. Some 37 million shoppers visit the latter's main store in Paris every year.</p>
      <p>LVMH, which first snapped up a stake in La Samaritaine in 2001, said it had spent 750 million euros ($830.70 million) on its makeover, which includes a contemporary, wavy glass exterior on one side by Japanese architectural duo SANAA.</p>
      <p>The store had to shut its doors in 2005 as its original glass flooring was not sufficiently fire-resistant.</p>
      <p>Operators expects half of shoppers to be made up of tourists from overseas and other parts of France, who will account for a majority of revenue.</p>
      <p>The complex will include a luxury rooftop hotel and be home to 96 flats under a social housing scheme.</p>
