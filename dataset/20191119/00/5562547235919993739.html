      <p>The Greek Freak adds that winning, ultimately, is the only thing that matters when it comes to his legacy.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28111970/giannis-antetokounmpo-wants-one-best-players-ever-play">ESPN</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I definitely want to be one of the best players to ever play, but in order for me to do that, I’ve got to be locked in every night,” Antetokounmpo told ESPN on Monday night, as he reflected on that initial trip here. “Because at the end of the day, if you don’t win, it doesn’t count. All the effort you spent, if you don’t win, it really doesn’t count.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Antetokounmpo pushed through five offensive fouls and eight turnovers to finish with 33 points and 10 rebounds in the Milwaukee Bucks’ 115-101 win over the Bulls.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I try to lock in and focus on what I’ve got to do. But yeah, previous years, like when I saw No. 23 — and not just 23, when I saw 33 — that was a guy I used to talk to a lot, Scottie,” Antetokounmpo said. “It definitely motivated me. [Chicago is] a great basketball city. It’s a city that Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen played in, so I had that extra juice in me.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“But now I’m just going out there and trying to win no matter what so you can just go back home and be happy.”</i>
