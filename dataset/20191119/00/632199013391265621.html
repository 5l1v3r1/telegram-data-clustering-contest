      <h1>Almost half of employers think drivers have poor eyesight</h1>

      <p>Nearly half (45%) of employers are concerned that their employees who drive for work do not have the necessary eyesight fit for driving, according to research from Specsavers Corporate Eyecare.</p>
      <p>As sponsors of <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/tag/road-safety-week-2019">Road Safety Week (November 18-24)</a>, Specsavers is encouraging employers to take the lead in ensuring drivers have adequate vision to drive for work purposes.</p>
      <p>The eyecare company surveyed more than 500 human resource decision makers from a wide range of companies across the UK.</p>
      <p>Jim Lythgow, director of strategic alliances at Specsavers Corporate Eyecare, said: “It may be a surprise to many that this figure is so high, especially as the legal requirements for driver eyesight are actually quite minimal.</p>
      <p>“The law still just requires a driver to be able to read a modern number plate from a distance of 20 metres.</p>
      <p>"The fact that so many employers are concerned should serve as a wake-up call.”</p>
      <p>The research shows that employers are taking the correct steps to improve the situation, with nearly three quarters (72%) saying that they offer workplace eye care to all who drive for work.</p>
      <p>“If employers are offering eye care to the majority of drivers but are still concerned that their eyesight is not good enough, then clearly something is missing.</p>
      <p>“It is not enough to just offer corporate eye care. It needs to be proactively communicated and promoted too.</p>
      <p>“If employees were more aware of the risks they run by not having regular eye tests, such as potentially losing their driving license, they may be more likely to take up the benefit,” added Lythgow.</p>
      <p>Specsavers has urged companies to put up posters and information on staff noticeboards or to upload details of eye care benefits to the company website.</p>
      <p>One initiative Specsavers participate in is access to wellbeing days, which allow them to promote all health benefits on offer to their staff.</p>
