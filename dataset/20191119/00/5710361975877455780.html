      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Renault's interim chief executive Clotilde Delbos said on Tuesday the carmaker did not rule out pulling out of some products or markets as part of a review of mid-term goals.</p>
      <p>"We will avoid it if we can ... but we have to ask ourselves the question ... can we just keep up the same strategy? I donâ€™t think so. The market is changing, we have to adapt," Delbos said at a conference.</p>
