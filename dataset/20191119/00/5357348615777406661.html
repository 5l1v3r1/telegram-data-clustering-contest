        <b>OKLAHOMA, USA (AP) — Two men and a woman were fatally shot yesterday outside a Walmart store in south-western Oklahoma.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two victims were shot inside a car and the third was in the parking lot outside the store in Duncan, Police Chief Danny Ford said.</p>
      <p>Two bodies covered with sheets were visible in the parking lot Monday afternoon. One body was in the driver's seat of a red, two-door car. The other body was lying on the ground next to the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Bullet holes were visible in the car's windshield. Police said in a <i>Facebook </i>post that a handgun was found at the scene.</p>
      <p>Authorities have not identified those killed, but Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks has confirmed that the shooter was among the dead.</p>
      <p>Authorities from multiple agencies, including the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the state highway patrol and the Stephens County sheriff's office were investigating the scene.</p>
      <p>Police were also looking for witnesses to the shooting, Ford said.</p>
      <p>Aaron Helton, of Duncan, said he was parking outside the Walmart where he planned to buy groceries when he heard about nine gunshots.</p>
      <p>“I arrived and there were three bodies,” Helton said.</p>
      <p>No staff members were involved in the shooting and the store was not evacuated, Walmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins said in an e-mail.</p>
      <p>“This was an isolated incident in the parking lot and was not an active shooter situation,” Jenkins said.</p>
      <p>Duncan is about 80 miles (130 kilometres) south of Oklahoma City. The Walmart is in a commercial centre that includes a sporting goods store and a dollar store along US Highway 81, the main road that passes through Duncan heading south towards Texas.</p>
