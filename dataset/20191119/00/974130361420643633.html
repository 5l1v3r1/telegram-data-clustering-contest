      <h1>GAA 'Surprised And Disappointed' At CPA Withdrawal From Fixture Task Force</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Maurice Brosnan</a></address>
      <p>The GAA have issued a statement to state they are "surprised and disappointed" after the Club Players Association withdrew from the GAA’s Fixtures Calendar Review Task Force body days before they were due to deliver their recommendations.</p>
      <p>In a statement of their own earlier today, the CPA explained they could not "in good conscience put our names to such a compromised document."</p>
      <p>They went on to claim the group was a "Trojan Horse designed to give cover to GAA authorities to ratify the status quo while having the appearance of consultation and thoughtful deliberation".</p>
      <p>The GAA responded and said the work of the Task Force will continue to be finished later this month.</p>
      <blockquote>The GAA is surprised and disappointed at the decision of the CPA to withdraw its representative Michael Higgins from the Fixture Calendar Review Task Force particularly at such an advanced stage and given that the work of the Task Force is nearing its completion.<br/>The group met for the first time on June 20 and consulted widely. It is understood that the Task Force analysed submissions, proposals and comments across a wide range of issues as outlined in their Terms of Reference.<br/>The Task Force was expected to develop proposals in a balanced way recognising and respecting the sometimes conflicting views and needs of the various stakeholders involved and the many individuals and groups that it consulted.<br/>It is understood that the CPA have been represented at all meetings of the Task Force and that they have fully engaged throughout.</blockquote>
