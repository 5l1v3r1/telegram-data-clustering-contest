      <p>A new season of “The Crown” just premiered on Netflix, so now is the time to catch up with the inspired-by-true-events series.

      <p>The 10 new episodes feature Oscar-winning actress Olivia Colman, Helena Bonham-Carter, plus two ex-“Game of Thrones” stars: Tobias Menzies and Charles Dance.</p>

      <p><b>Seasons:</b> 1</p>
      <p><b>Episodes:</b> 6</p>
      <p>This is a new reality series from Netflix in which pop star Charli XCX does her own twist on the “Making the Band” series.

      <h3>‘Shine On with Reese’</h3>

      <p><b>Episodes:</b> 9</p>
      <p>“Shine On” was originally a DirecTV series, but now all nine episodes are streaming on Netflix. This is yet another unscripted series, but in more of a talk-show format. Actress Reese Witherspoon meets with a different icon in each episode, and her star-studded guest lineup includes director Ava DuVernay, singer Pink, music legend Dolly Parton, and more.</p>
      <h3>‘The Kominsky Method’</h3>

      <p><b>Episodes:</b> 16</p>
      <p>The second season of “The Kominsky Method” premiered last month with little fanfare, but this series (created by “King of Sitcoms” Chuck Lorre) is one of the most consistently pleasant shows on Netflix at the moment. It’s fun, poignant, and packed with talent. If you’re in the mood for an easygoing comedy, “The Kominsky Method” is a good place to start.</p>
