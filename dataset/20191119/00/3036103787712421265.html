      <p>As technology continues to evolve, it has become increasingly important to have access to the right infrastructure for your business.</p>
      <p>IBM Power Systems servers are designed to execute your business’s most advanced and process-critical data applications – ensuring that you don’t have to worry about server workload management.</p>

      <p>IBM Power servers are multi-functional, capable of running mission-critical workloads and are able to support future AI implementations.</p>
      <p>They are driven by a built-in PowerVM virtualisation, which ensures that the next-generation IBM Power9 systems are ready for the cloud.</p>
      <p>This ensures that you can implement cloud environments that best suit your business, and provide the best performance for what you require.</p>
      <h3>Power9 servers</h3>
      <p>IBM’s Power9 servers have been developed to handle the most demanding, data-intensive computing that you could possibly put them through.</p>
      <p>This ensures that businesses are able to access critical insights from the efficient processing of data.</p>
      <p>These servers boast industry-leading reliability and security, ensuring that you can rest assured knowing that your important data is protected from issues caused by human error or malicious parties.</p>
      <p>As proof of its reliability, Power Systems servers were ranked first for every major reliability criterion by the ITIC Global Server Hardware Reliability Report.</p>
      <p>Power9 servers also offer some of the best value-for-money on the market.</p>
      <p>This is because superior core performance and memory bandwidth enables these servers to provide impressive levels of output – offering superior price-to-performance benefits.</p>
      <p>Power9 servers are available across a variety of areas, including Power9 for Linux, Power9 for Enterprise, and Power9 for Enterprise AI, Deep Learning and Machine Learning.</p>
      <h3>IBM Hyperconverged systems</h3>
      <p>IBM’s Power servers aren’t limited to their impressive hardware, however.</p>
      <p>IBM Hyperconverged systems, powered by Nutanix, provide IT customers with the capability to dramatically simplify their data centre operations.</p>
      <p>This is achieved through the utilisation of the Nutanix cloud platform, which is capable of transforming complicated IT infrastructure into an efficient virtualisation.</p>
      <p>Hyperconverged systems are designed to be scaled both up and down without causing the traditional bottlenecks associated with traditional architectures.</p>
      <p>Instead, scaling can be done in minutes simply by adding new nodes to your distributed architecture – ensuring that processing power is shared equally and doesn’t starve other processes.</p>
      <p>Some of the other benefits of IBM Hyperconverged systems include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>73% less time to deploy compute.</li>
        <li>61% less time to manage.</li>
        <li>97% fewer occurrences of downtime.</li>
        <li>Twice the price performance compared to commodity processor architectures on popular workloads such as MongoDB and EDB Postgres.</li>
      </ul>
