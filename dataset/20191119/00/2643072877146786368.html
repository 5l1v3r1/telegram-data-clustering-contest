      <p>Omokri who took to his Twitter account wrote, <i>“Some say I am not speaking on Kogi elections. I‘ve tried. I sponsored buses for democracy to ferry Nigerians to vote. I fed them, I have talked and done.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“It‘s now time for me to accept that Nigerians deserve the government they have. Let me focus on evangelism.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        <i>“If Nigerians are grateful people, many people will be willing to die for Nigeria but suppose Femi Fani-Kayode and I are arrested today, who will put their property and money at risk to bail us out the way both of us have put our lives and liberty at risk for Nigeria?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Fourth and final- Nnamdi Kanu fought for Biafra, and Biafrans appreciate him. If you fight for Nigeria, will Nigerians appreciate you?”</i>
