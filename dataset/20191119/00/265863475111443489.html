      <h1>John Mayer Gushes Over Ex-Girlfriend Taylor Swift’s Music A Decade After Their Break Up – See The Clip!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:21:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:21</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Even though their relationship was short-lived and ended a decade ago, it looks like there is only love between exes Taylor Swift and John Mayer – at least as far as he’s concerned! During an IG Live session with Shawn Mendes yesterday, John had only good things to say about his former girlfriend.</p>
      <p>The man praised Taylor’s music in particular and the compliment comes at the best time considering the singer’s drama with Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>John started by sharing his great opinion of her latest single titled ‘Lover’ since Taylor and Shawn collabed on a remix of it.</p>
      <p>But while he stressed that he simply ‘loved the song’ John could not help but poke fun at some of the lyrics.</p>
      <p>It was more of a relatable joke, however, with no malicious intent on his part!</p>
      <p>‘I get a little chuckle because she says, ‘We can keep the Christmas lights up until January,’ and I go…you’re insane. Everyone keeps their Christmas lights up until January!’ he exclaimed. He’s not wrong, though!</p>

      <p>Of course, since he was live with Shawn, he made sure to mention that he also loved his contribution to the song!</p>
      <p>While joking around some more, he even made up his own lyrics, once again, relating to those lines about the Christmas lights.</p>
      <p>‘We can keep the Christmas lights up until January. And then about January 5, we’ll take the lights down, and we’ll put ’em in a box and we’ll label that box Christmas lights, and we’ll put ’em in the attic until next December! Boy, that’s a crazy love, I’ll tell ya!’ he sang to the tune.</p>
      <p>Are you surprised John Mayer is such a fan of his ex and her music, or not?</p>
