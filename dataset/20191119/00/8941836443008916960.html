      <p>TURIN, Italy (AP) - Defender Leonardo Bonucci has extended his contract at Juventus, tying him to the Italian champion until 2024.</p>
      <p>Juventus announced the extension on Tuesday but did not give financial details of his contract.</p>
      <p>Bonucci first joined Juventus in 2010 but spent the 2017-2018 season at AC Milan after a 40-million-euro ($45 million) transfer amid reports of a dressing room spat.</p>
      <p>The Italy defender returned to Juventus in 2018, in swap deal with Mattia Caldara, and penned a five-year deal.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Bonucci has won seven Serie A titles and three Italian Cups with Juventus. He has made almost 100 appearances for Italy, captaining the Azzurri on 10 occasions.</p>
