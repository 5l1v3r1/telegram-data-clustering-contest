      <p>A further £9 billion a year in operational spending would be funded through raising taxes, including corporation tax which would rise to 24%.</p>
      <p>The party argues that borrowing on such a scale is both justified – given the looming “climate crisis” – and prudent as it would kick start economic and social regeneration.</p>
      <p>It says public sector investment would act as a catalyst for private sector investment, as private investors seek to share in the financial rewards of a transition to a low carbon future.</p>
      <p>Co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: “We’re proud to put forward a manifesto which puts us on track to remain in the European Union and make the whole country carbon neutral by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain.</p>

      <p>“It’s the most ambitious Green new deal proposed anywhere in the world. While the other parties are trying to catch up, we’re still racing ahead, reaching new horizons.”</p>
      <p>In other measures, the party said it would increase NHS funding by at least £6 billion a year, scrap university tuition fees and introduce a universal basic income with a “phased-in unconditional payment to everyone at a level above their subsistence needs”.</p>
      <p>It would also scrap the first-past-the-post system in elections, replacing it with proportional representation, create a fully elected House of Lords and extend voting rights to 16 and 17 year-olds.</p>
      <p>Mr Bartley said there was "differentiation" with Labour over its policies on Brexit and climate change.</p>
      <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Our proposals today are very much about remaining in the EU, another point of differentiation with Labour, but also transforming the country, getting to that net zero target by 2030.</p>
      <p>"Looking at every sector of the economy, spelling out how we need to decarbonise and what kind of investment is going to be needed, being honest about that investment."</p>
      <p>He added: "When there's a war, when we're facing an existential threat, we don't hold back, we know that we have to tackle it. Frankly, if the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now."</p>
      <p>Mr Bartley said the party wanted to introduce a frequent flyer levy and was against airport expansion</p>
