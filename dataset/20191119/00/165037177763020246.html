        <b>Milan Skriniar is being linked once again with Real Madrid and Barcelona. Even though 'Mundo Deportivo' are saying that Barcelona have ruled out his signing, the company which represents the footballer says they is a two way battle for the footballer. Real Madrid apparently have the advantage.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At 24, <b>Skriniar's market value is increasing as seasons go by</b>. In his third season at Inter Milan, the Slovakian defender is being linked with <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> and Barca again. <b>The two Spanish giants have shown interest in him</b> in the last few months. </p>
      <p>Mithat Halis, member of 'Star&amp;Friend', the company which represents Skriniar spoke about that, <b>These words have increased rumours over a possible departure</b> by the <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/internazionale/">Inter</a> defender.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-skriniar-187303/">Skriniar</a> is worth 100 million euros. Real Madrid and Barcelona have been fighting for his transfer for two years. Now <b>Real Madrid are closer to reachng a deal with Inter Milan</b> because they want and need him much more than Barca,". This is what the agent said in an interview which 'AS' has published.</p>

      <p>'Mundo Deportivo' also support these comments. <a href="http://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barca</a> <b>have apparently ruled out the signing of the Slovakian.</b> </p>
      <p>And they explained the reasoning behind Real's interest. "<b>Real Madrid are looking for alternatives to Ramos and Varane</b> in the centre of defence and that is why they have approached Inter. <b>I think he could go to Real Madrid</b>."</p>
      <p>Eder Militao's signing has not been good for Real Madrid, <b>Skriniar</b>, <b>with more of a track record</b> at a club like Inter, could meet Zinedine Zidane's demands. </p>
