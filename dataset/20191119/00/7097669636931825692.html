      <h1>Why Russia's Stealth Okhotnik Drone Is a Big Deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">David Axe</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point:</b> Russia has long-wanted this kind of a powerful stealth drone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/tag/su-57">The Russian air force’s first stealth fighter</a> has flown in close formation with its first armed, stealth drone, possibly <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-just-flew-its-new-stealth-fighter-and-stealth-drone-side-side-84411">indicating that the two types might fly and fight together in the future</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-hunter-drone-has-one-major-stealth-problem-81361">Okhotnik unmanned aerial vehicle</a> made its first joint flight with an Su-57 manned fighter, the Russian defense ministry announced on Sept. 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>The ministry released a video of the flight, which reportedly took place over a military test base and lasted 30 minutes. </p>
      <p>“During the flight, the UAV interacted with the Su-57 to test extending the fighter's radar and target designation range for long-range air-launched weapons outside enemy air-defense coverage,” Jane’s <a href="https://www.janes.com/article/91559/russia-s-okhotnik-uav-makes-first-flight-with-su-57">reported</a>, citing the Kremlin.</p>
      <p>The test flight implies that the Russian air force intends to operate the Okhotnik and the Su-57 in mixed formations. “This seems to be the global trend,” commented Samuel Bendett, an independent expert on the Russian military.</p>
      <p>Bendett is a researcher for the Center for Naval Analyses and the American Foreign Policy Council.</p>
      <p>He pointed to the U.S. military’s own program to develop a “wingman” drone that possesses the ranger, performance and weapons-capability to fly into combat with manned fighters. China, Japan and Australia also are developing wingman drones.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, Ohotnik may be a long-range air-defense penetrator, in which case it would need to fly ‘solo’ in an automated mode, in order not to utilize Russian manned assets,” Bendett told The National Interest.</p>
      <p>There’s no reason Okhotnik could not perform both roles. <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/tag/xq-58">The XQ-58</a> that the U.S. Air Force is developing for the Americans’ own wingman-drone program can be controlled by a pilot in a nearby manned aircraft or by an operator at a facility on the ground.</p>
