      <p>WASHINGTON - The White House has attacked its own top Ukraine official as he testified to an impeachment hearing that a phone call made by the president was "improper" and had left him in "shock". <br/><br/>Lt Col Alexander Vindman told Congress that President Donald Trump made "inappropriate" political demands of the Ukrainian president. <br/><br/>"I couldn't believe what I was hearing," Lt Col Vindman said. <br/><br/>The hearings are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential power. <br/><br/>An Iraq war veteran who serves in a senior role on the US National Security Council, Lt Col Vindman testified before the House on Tuesday in his Army dress uniform. <br/><br/>As he described his reaction to hearing a call between President Trump and his Ukranian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky, Lt Col Vindman came under attack by the official White House Twitter account, which posted a critical quote from his former boss on the NSC questioning his judgment. <br/><br/>Republican congressman pressed Lt Col Vindman on the remark and questioned his loyalty to the US - asking about instances in which Ukrainian officials approached him about becoming the country's defence minister. <br/><br/>"Every single time I dismissed it," Lt Col Vindman said. "I'm an American." <br/><br/>The impeachment hearings are an effort by Democrats to establish whether Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new leader, Zelensky, into announcing a corruption inquiry into Joe Biden, Trump's leading Democratic rival for the US presidency. <br/><br/><b>White House goes on the attack</b> <br/><br/>Lt Col Vindman told the US House intelligence committee that he had been concerned by the president's demands to investigate Biden. <br/><br/>"It was probably an element of shock that maybe, in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukrainian policy could play out was playing out, how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security," he said. <br/><br/>"It was inappropriate, it was improper for the president to request - to demand - an investigation into a political opponent, especially [from] a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge," he told the committee. <br/><br/>He had reported the "inappropriate" discussion to NSC lawyers "out of a sense of duty". <br/><br/>The Trump administration's use of the official Twitter account to attack political opponents has drawn criticism in the past. <br/><br/>Lt Col Vindman was among the US officials who listened in on the 25 July call between the two leaders. He is a decorated Iraq war veteran who was born in Ukraine; his father made the decision 40 years ago to move his family out of the Soviet Union to go and live in the US. <br/><br/>Vindman offered reassurance to his father, who brought his children to the US from the Soviet Union 40 years ago, that he was sitting in the US Capitol and would be "fine for telling the truth". <br/><br/>Toward the end of Vindman's appearance, he was asked by a Democratic congressman to read that line again - and then added why he's not afraid of testifying today. <br/><br/>"Because this is America," he said. "This is the country I have served and defended... and here, right matters." <br/><br/><b>Who else testified on Tuesday?</b> <br/><br/>The other witness in the morning session was Jennifer Williams, a foreign service adviser to Vice-President Mike Pence. <br/><br/>She said Trump's reference to Biden in the 25 July call with Zelensky had been "unusual" because it delved into domestic US politics. <br/><br/>"The reference to Biden sounded political to me," she said. <br/><br/>The inquiry's afternoon session heard from Morrison and Kurt Volker, former US special representative to Ukraine. <br/><br/>Volker told the hearing President Trump "had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past" and despite "positive news and recommendations" being conveyed about Ukraine's new president "he was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view". <br/><br/>Morrison, who resigned from his position some weeks ago, says he felt no pressure to quit and feared no retaliation. <br/><br/>In his opening statement he said he did not know the identity of a whistleblower whose report helped start the inquiry.
