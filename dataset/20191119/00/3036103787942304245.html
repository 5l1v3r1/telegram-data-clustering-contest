      <h1>How Ericsson’s analytics and services contributed to MTN becoming the biggest network in Rwanda</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/partner" target="_blank">Partner</a></address>
      <p>MTN has increased its market share in Rwanda from 11% in the first half of 2018, to 54% at the end of the first half of 2019, the latest Ericsson Mobility Report reveals.</p>
      <p>Ericsson has released a special edition of its regular Mobility Report, highlighting the effects over the past year of MTN’s implementation of the Ericsson Customer Experience Programme (ECEP).</p>
      <p>“The ECEP is a proactive approach to improving customer experience by focusing on network performance improvements in operator 2G, 3G and LTE networks,” Ericsson said.</p>
      <p>During 2018 and 2019, MTN ran the programme in eight of the 21 countries in Africa where it operates networks: Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Rwanda, and South Africa.</p>
      <p>Ericsson said that the programme has two major objectives:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Provide operators with recommendations of where to spend money on their networks (CAPEX), based on a factual network evolution proposal that is aligned with the operator’s budget cycle.</li>
        <li>Provide insights and recommendations to improve on customer experience and network performance.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>One of the things they can help operators measure and analyse, Ericsson said, is how subscribers are using the network and what the capabilities of their phones are.</p>
      <p>This helps operators ensure that subscribers are getting the most out of their phones and are using the right network technology.</p>
      <p>“If someone has an LTE capable handset, they should be on the LTE data network, not 3G,” Ericsson said.</p>
      <p>There were two major reasons a subscriber would own an LTE-capable device, but not be using the technology, MTN found: older handsets came with LTE switched off by default, and people believe that LTE consumes data faster.</p>
      <p>MTN said that, armed with the data from Ericsson’s tools, its marketing and sales department conducted direct campaigns with subscribers. It also launched an education drive to end-users.</p>
      <h3>Big customer experience improvement</h3>
      <p>Rwanda has a single 4G wholesale network with national roaming, so MTN’s focus during the ECEP was to extend and improve its 3G network.</p>
      <p>“The better the user experience, the more a user will use the network. If the video experience is a good experience, users start using it more often,” said MTN.</p>
      <p>MTN expanded its 3G network using radio frequency spectrum it has in the 900MHz band, which improved coverage, increased speeds across the country, and allowed for future data traffic growth.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the year, MTN saw significant improvements in 3G data speeds, and call success rates. It also reduced the number of dropped calls on its 3G network.</p>
      <p>In addition to its substantial increase in market share, MTN grew the number of subscribers on its network by 23% and saw revenue growth of 27%.</p>
      <p>As a result of the improved network performance, MTN also saw a large increase in customer satisfaction.</p>
      <p>MTN’s Net Promoter Score (NPS) in Rwanda improved from 2% in the first and second quarters of 2018, to 18% at the end of the first quarter in 2019. By the end of the first quarter of 2019, MTN was the operator with the highest NPS in Rwanda.</p>
      <p>Ericsson and MTN were jointly awarded the “Delivering Excellence in Customer Experience Award” at AfricaCom 2019 in Cape Town for the roll-out of the Ericsson Customer Experience Programme.</p>
