      <h1>Bank Zero brings world-first tech to South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Bank Zero recently <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/banking/327429-bank-zero-goes-live-with-debit-card.html"><b>went live with its debit card</b></a>, which it said was the last step in completing its core value proposition.</p>
      <p>Following this launch, the bank will now conduct rigorous security and system tests by simulating card attacks and testing card fraud detection.</p>
      <p>The debit card is currently live in a beta stage, with Bank Zero planning to launch a public offering in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/banking/327457-bank-zeros-new-debit-card-all-the-details.html"><b>Bank Zero said its patented debit card</b></a> offers advanced security features to protect customers from theft and fraud.</p>
      <h3>Starting a new bank has benefits</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnbcafrica.com/videos/2019/11/14/how-bank-zero-plans-to-deal-with-card-fraud-data-theft-ahead-of-launch/"><b>Speaking to CNBC Africa</b></a>, Bank Zero founder and former FNB CEO Michael Jordaan said the advantage of starting a new bank is that you can do things from first principles.</p>
      <p>“We looked at credit cards and found it interesting that while there is a number printed on your card, you can have a separate hidden number behind it,” said Jordaan.</p>
      <p>“We designed our banking system that you can use this hidden number when you do online purchases.”</p>
      <p>A patent for the debit card filed by Bank Zero CEO Yatin Narsai details how the debit card plans to cut down on fraud and theft while maintaining modern payment features.</p>
      <p>Bank Zero’s debit card will have multiple card numbers for different payment types to cut down on the potential for fraudulent payments.</p>
      <p>The card will have a standard card number printed on its surface which can be used for online payments, in addition to a separate card number stored in the magnetic stripe for physical purchases.</p>
      <p>The patent also showed that a different card number could be stored in the EMV chip on the card, which would be used exclusively for payment systems which required it.</p>
      <p>In this way, Bank Zero can prevent criminals from completing certain purchases with your credentials if they somehow manage to obtain them.</p>
      <p>“Thus, in one example, all of these three card numbers effectively identify a different card … the single card will have stored thereon three different credit card numbers,” the patent states.</p>
      <p>“For example, the first card number could be a credit card number for magnetic swipes only, the second card number could be for online purchases only and the third card number could be for tap and dip purchases only.”</p>
      <p>The patent also stated that these card numbers could be implemented in combination, for example – the first card number could be a credit card number, the second a debit card number for online purchases, and the third a private card number for tap purchases only.</p>
      <p>The bank said this approach is called “lane processing” and will allow Bank Zero to process transactions based on the card implementation characteristics and improve authentication methods.</p>
      <p>Jordaan added that when you lose your card, replace your card, or when it expires, you do not have to go back to all merchants to change your card details.</p>
      <p>“Apart from the convenience factor, it also safeguards users against criminals which may steal your physical card which has all the details to do online banking,” said Jordaan.</p>
      <p>He is confident that this innovation can save consumers millions in preventing fraud associated with credit cards.</p>
      <h3>Additional security features</h3>
      <p>Jordaan said being a mobile- and card-only bank gives them the ability to use innovative security features.</p>
      <p>“Limiting banking to an app on a smartphone has the benefit of seeing where the customer is and easily pick up when there is a fraudulent transaction out of a strange location,” he said.</p>
      <p>Jordaan said there are also many other benefits associated with launching a mobile-first and mobile-centric bank.</p>
      <p>“There are many things which you can do on a mobile phone which you cannot do at a bank branch.”</p>
      <p>“For example, when you send a WhatsApp message you get one tick when it was sent, another tick when it arrives and blue ticks when it is read.”</p>
      <p>You can do the same things with funds which are transferred – when it was sent, when it arrived, and when it is confirmed that the receiving party can use the money.</p>
      <p>“We built our banking system to do these types of things from the start,” said Jordaan.</p>
