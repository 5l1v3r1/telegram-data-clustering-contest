        <b>The bank claims the platform will help it prepare for the open banking regime and is part of its digital banking strategy.</b>

      <p>Westpac has partnered with Microsoft to announce its Data Driven Experience Platform (DDEP), a real-time data hub with artificial intelligence and machine learning, which will be used by the bank to provide more personalised services to its customers. <br/><br/>Built on Microsoft Azure, the DDEP is underpinned by Azure DevOps, as well as Azure Sentinel and Security Centre to secure any data located in the hub. <br/><br/>According to Westpac Group CIO Craig Bright, the DDEP is part of the bank's wider <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/westpac-posts-au6-8b-profit-as-it-preps-new-bank-as-a-service-platform/">digital-only banking strategy</a>, and touted the platform has also been built with the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjdrq6X9PTlAhVGp48KHXlnAmIQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Faustralias-open-banking-regime-generic-product-data-available-from-1-july%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3J5LK3eKDAayL9RnXYulyb">open banking regime</a> -- due to be enforced on February 1 and predicted to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/westpac-predicts-open-banking-to-cost-au200m-to-implement/">cost the bank AU$200 million</a> to implement -- in mind. <br/><br/>"The Data Driven Experience Platform gives us access to an incredibly rich set of capabilities that enable us to engage digitally in real-time with our customers in a way that's personalised, intelligent and autonomous," he said.<br/><br/>Bright said the bank will use the data in the DDEP as part of its new mobile app due to be rolled out next year.</p>
      <p>In addition to the co-investment, Westpac announced that the company has been shifting to Microsoft 365, which has resulted in the roll out of common desktop and cloud-based applications, including OneDrive, SharePoint, Yammer, and Teams, to 55% of its employees. The bank said the roll out puts the bank on track to complete the transition to Microsoft 365 by next year.<br/><br/>Westpac added it is also leveraging Microsoft 356 E5 suite to further enhance its security capabilities, and plans to shortly adopt Microsoft's Azure-based virtual desktop infrastructure to allow its workforce to launch new workloads arbitrarily onsite and in the public cloud. </p>
      <p>In its financial results announced earlier in the month, Westpac's statutory net profit for 2019 financial year slipped 16% to just shy of AU$6.8 billion. Operating expenses increased by 6% to AU$540 million compared to the same period a year prior.</p>
