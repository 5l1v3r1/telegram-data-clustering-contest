      <p>SANDY HOOK, N.J. (AP) - The federal government is asking New Jersey and New York beachgoers to report any sightings they might have of stranded turtles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> says a recent cold snap has suddenly resulted in cold-stunned sea turtles washing up on beaches. The agency says the problem is particularly acute in Sandy Hook and Long Beach Island in northern New Jersey.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration/">NOAA</a> is also asking residents to keep pets away from the turtles because they are in a “severely distressed state.” Residents can also help by moving the turtles above the high tide line and covering them lightly with seaweed. It’s also helpful to wait until trained responders show up.</p>
