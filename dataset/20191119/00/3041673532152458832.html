      <h1>This Beloved SoCal Vintage Porsche Workshop Burned Down, Here’s What You Can Do To Help</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petrolicious.com/author/petrolicious" target="_blank">Petrolicious Productions</a></address>
      <p>After nearly 40 years of service in the Los Angeles area, John Benton of Benton Performance has emerged as the guru for all things Porsche 912s. <a href="https://petrolicious.com/films/this-porsche-912-is-fully-committed">We shared his story</a> back in 2016, and were heartbroken to hear that his shop fell victim to fire a few weeks ago. Luckily nobody was on site or harmed, but these workshops are little treasure troves and it’s said they lost over $3 million in irreplaceable cars, matching-number drivetrains, tools, Porsche memorabilia, and personal items.</p>
      <p>Without shops like Benton Performance, enjoying classic cars just wouldn’t be possible. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/benton-performance-fire?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet">We’d like to share John’s gofundme page</a> in case any one in the Petrolicious audience is interesting in chipping in to help them get back in action.</p>
