      <p>POLICE are on the hunt for two men who held up a Logan service station armed with a sawn-off rifle early on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The two men stormed the Park Ridge business just before 1.00am, jumping over the counter and stealing cash from the till before fleeing in a stolen white Holden Colorado.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old male employee retreated and sheltered in a rear office during the ordeal.</p>
      <p>The stolen vehicle the two offenders left in was then spotted around an hour later travelling at speed southbound on the M1 at Coomera.</p>
      <p>The first man is described as tanned, no shirt, covering his face with a grey shirt, short dark brown crew cut hair wearing dark blue shorts with a white stripe and black and white shoes. He was carrying a sawn-off rifle in his right hand.</p>
      <p>The second man is described as Caucasian, wearing a dark grey hooded jumper with blue on the front, covering his face, blue jeans and black shoes.</p>
