      <p><b>AUSTRALIA –</b> Through its new Melbourne office renewable diesel producer <a href="https://www.neste.com/">Neste</a> plans to ramp up the sourcing of raw materials in the region.</p>
      <p>The world’s leading producer of renewable diesel – from waste and residues – currently has a capacity to produce 3 million tons of renewable products annually from its facilities worldwide. The new office is just the latest step in its global expansion strategy.</p>
      <blockquote>“The opening of our new office in Australia marks another important step in Neste’s global growth strategy. Our aim is to become a global leader in renewable and circular solutions. By opening a local office, we are better placed to cooperate closely with our partners to secure the supply of waste and residue raw materials. This in turn enables us to serve the growing global demand for low-carbon solutions in transport and cities, aviation, polymers and chemicals,” said Matti Lehmus, Executive Vice President of Renewables Platform at Neste.</blockquote>
