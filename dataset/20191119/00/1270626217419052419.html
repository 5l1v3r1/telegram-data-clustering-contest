      <p>3 more measles cases have been confirmed from the Serua/Namosi subdivision.</p>
      <p>There are now 7 confirmed cases of measles from the Serua/Namosi subdivision.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Ministry of Health and Medical Service says, the 3 new cases are of a 3 month and a 7-month-old baby from Wainadoi,  a 19-year-old from Navunikabi in Namosi.</p>
      <p>They say two babies are currently admitted under isolation at Navua Hospital.</p>
      <p>The Serua/Namosi Outbreak Response Team has implemented response measures – including isolation of the cases, quarantine and vaccination of contacts and at-risk communities.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Health is urging people to get vaccinated at any Health Centres and Hospitals around the country.</p>
      <p>The symptoms of measles are fever and a rash with a runny nose, sneezing, cough, red and watery eyes and white spots inside the mouth.</p>
      <p>The rash starts after the other symptoms and spreads all over the body.</p>
      <p>Measles is a highly infectious airborne viral disease that spreads easily through the air through breathing, coughing, and sneezing.</p>
      <p>You are at risk of getting measles if you breathe the same air as someone with the disease and you are not immune if you have not been vaccinated, or you have never had the disease.</p>
      <p>There is no specific treatment for measles, as it is the body’s immune system that fights off the disease.</p>
      <p>Most people recover from measles infection in 8-10 days with rest and ensuring that they are eating and drinking to avoid dehydration.</p>
      <p>Some people infected with measles develop severe complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis (brain swelling).</p>
      <p>The last measles outbreak in Fiji was in 2006 and the last cases of measles were reported in 2016 which was brought in by people from other countries.</p>
