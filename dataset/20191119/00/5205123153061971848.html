        <b>TALK about 'sweet dreams'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>So there's a Nutella-themed hotel now and I think you'll agree it needs everybody's attention.</p>
      <p>Ferrero, the company that owns Nutella, announced the opening of the pop-up hotel in California's Napa Valley, and it looks like something out of a Roald Dahl book.</p>
      <p>It's called Hotella Nutella (what else?), and as the scrumptious name suggests, the entire place is plastered with Nutella-inspired decor.</p>

      <p>Geoffrey Zakarian of the <i><b>Food Network</b></i> and <i>Iron Chef</i> will be cooking breakfast for dinner in the hotel.</p>
      <p>TV personality Tanya Holland will make southern-inspired Nutella breakfasts, and pancake artists DanCakes will teach a class on making creative pancake art.</p>
      <p>But just before you start gathering every spatula in the house and packing your bags, know that the hotel isn't temporary.</p>

      <p>It'll be open on the weekend of January 10 - 12, 2020 only.</p>
      <p>If you fancy visiting, you need to head over to the official Hotella Nutella website, and enter their competition.</p>
      <p>In order to win a place, you'll have to create a video (60 seconds or less) demonstrating how Nutella makes your morning special, and send it in!</p>
      <p>Submissions end on December 8, so don't be (choco) late! - *see what we did there?</p>
      <p>Who knows, if enough people enter, we might be able to convince Ferrero to launch a permanent one - maybe just a little closer to home, though. *Next door to Irish Post HQ would be lovely.</p>
