      <p>Dozens of Passengers had a lucky escape Monday night after their moving bus caught fire at Beposo-Kyekyewere, near Teacher Mante along the Suhum-Nsawam stretch of the Accra to Kumasi Highways.</p>
      <p>The fully loaded Hyundai bus with registration number GN 8298 â€“ 15 heading towards the Suhum direction from Accra caught fire causing chaotic exit by passengers onboard.</p>
      <p>Although the Passengers and the driver escaped unhurt before the bus was eventually consumed with the fire, they were reportedly terribly traumatized.</p>
      <p>According to reports, it took personnel of Ghana National Fire Service from Nsawam some 25 minutes to douse the inferno but the bus was completely burnt beyond recognition.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Public Relations Officer of the Eastern Regional Police Command, Sergeant Francis Gomado told Starr News the Police and Fire Service Officials are jointly investigating the cause of the fire. He however appealed to the traumatized driver and the passengers who fled the scene before Police arrival to return to assist with the investigation.</p>
