      <p>MIAMI (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Rob Gronkowski</a> will be in Miami for the Super Bowl. The former Patriots tight end won’t be preparing for kickoff with Tom Brady and the rest of his old New England teammates.</p>
      <p>Instead, the man who retired from the Patriots and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> in March will be hosting his first Super Bowl party.</p>
      <p>And he’s doing it Gronk style.</p>
      <p>The three-time Super Bowl champ is hosting the “GRONK BEACH” festival on Saturday, Feb. 1, on Miami Beach in an event featuring <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a>’s favorites and combining a party with a music festival along with food and drinks. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> says it’s because nobody really knows Super Bowl weekend like he does.</p>
      <p>“I may not be playing the game this year, but I will still be going to Miami and I’m going to be debuting my very own music festival and its Gronk Beach,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> said. “I mean, you can’t ask for any other situation that better than that. Bring some wildness, some fun, to bring a music festival to Miami and not just on top of Miami, at the Super Bowl. It’s really never been done like that before.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> is teaming up with sponsor Monster Energy with performers including Rick Ross, Flo Rida, DJ Carnage, Kaskade, Diplo and 3LAU.</p>
      <p>“Whoever is going to be playing that game, who isn’t going to want to be at the party?” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> said. “So that might be the game. The game might be facing off behind the stage that weekend.”</p>
      <p>Patriots’ fans have held out hope that the fun-loving, ball-spiking tight end would change his mind and rejoin New England ever since <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> announced his retirement in March after nine seasons just shy of his 30th birthday. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> says they can console themselves by taking advantage of the chance to finally party with Gronk.</p>
      <p>“So many people to tell you the truth throughout my career always (told) me, ‘Oh I want a party with Gronk! I want to party with Gronk!’” So this opportunity to do it,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> said.</p>

        <p>Gronk Beach will be set at the North Beach Bandshell between 1 p.m.-7 p.m. Tickets go on sale Thursday at www.GronkBeach.com starting at $149.99 for an event that will include a luau theme with fire twirlers and hula dancers. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> says he expects tickets to go quickly for an event that won’t feature only his name.</p>
        <p>“It’s, we’ll be partying with everyone,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-gronkowski/">Gronkowski</a> said. “We’ll be partying on stage, we’ll be high-fiving everyone. We’ll be interacting with the crowd. It’s just going to be a great overall fun themed party where it just brings entertainment and joy to people’s lives.”</p>
