        <b>The potential "disaster" of missing out on the Champions League persuaded Spurs to sack Mauricio Pochettino says Harry Redknapp.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Harry Redknapp slammed Tottenham's players</b> for "massively under-achieving" and turning in "relegation form" <b>to leave Mauricio Pochettino out of a job</b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Spurs</a> sacked highly rated manager Pochettino on Tuesday after a poor start to the season that leaves last season's Champions League finalists <b>languishing in 14th place in the Premier League</b>. Ex-Tottenham boss Redknapp believes chairman Daniel Levy could not countenance missing out on a place in Europe's elite competition<b> having recently moved to a new stadium,</b> with poor domestic form in 2019 forcing his hand.</p>
      <p>"I'm surprised but looking at the form,<b> it's been relegation form over the past 24 or 25 games</b>," Redknapp told Sky Sports News. "That's where they've been from the end of last season into this year. Tottenham <b>not making Champions League this year would be a disaster</b> in Daniel's eyes. With the money they've spent on the stadium and the training ground."</p>
      <p><b>Pochettino's players have failed to match the standards</b> Tottenham set for the majority of his five-year tenure this time around and Redknapp told them they should reflect on the fact they cost their manager his job.</p>

      <p>"I think they've got a fantastic squad of players. <b>They've got internationals all over the place </b>– Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Lucas Moura, Son [Heung-min]," he said. "They're massively under-achieving at the minute. They [the board] have had a look and thought we aren’t going anywhere <b>They've pulled the panic button </b>and decided to make the change. The players have got him the sack, they've not performed well enough. If they all loved him so much, <b>perhaps they should have done a little bit better for him</b>."</p>

      <p>Redknapp tipped bookmaker's favourite Jose Mourinho or Napoli head coach Carlo Ancelotti to succeed Pochettino –<b> claiming Levy will already be in touch</b> with his chosen candidate if his own experience at White Hart Lane is anything to go by.</p>
      <p>"They'll have someone in mind,<b> they'll have spoken to somebody</b>. I know how they work. Jose Mourinho, Ancelotti, someone of that ilk. They tried to get Ancelotti when they sacked me. I knew they spoke to him while I was still at the club. They'll have spoken to somebody." They probably like Brendan Rodgers but they won’t get Brendan. <b>They spoke to Brendan when they got rid of me</b>."</p>

      <p>Although he proclaimed himself a fan of Pochettino, Redknapp was only willing to deem his well-regarded Tottenham tenure <b>as a qualified success.</b></p>
      <p><b>"They've had one Champions League final</b>. If you look back at the run, it [luck] went their way a little bit," he said. "They've not won a trophy with an incredible squad of players, full of internationals and <b>with possibly the best number nine in the world</b>. They haven't won anything. Eventually, Daniel and [Spurs owner] Joe Lewis are going to go 'hang on' especially this year when it looks like they aren't going to make the Champions League. <b>These are ruthless business men</b>, they're very, very clever men."</p>
      <p>Redknapp then alluded to Pochettino being a one-time target for Manchester United and added: "<b>He was reasonably successful</b>, I like him. I think he's great. I think he'll get a big club, there's no doubt about that. I know his advisers spoke to another club in the Premier League, it looked like it was a done deal. <b>He'll be in a big job very shortly</b>."</p>
