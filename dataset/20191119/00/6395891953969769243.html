      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - The Massachusetts Senate is preparing to debate a bill to create a statewide ban on all store carry-out plastic bags.</p>
      <p>The bill would require retailers to charge at least 10 cents for a recycled paper bag.</p>
      <p>Five cents would go to the city or town for enforcement of the ban. The remainder would go to the retailer to cover the cost of paper bags.</p>
      <p>More than 100 Massachusetts communities have already passed plastic bag bans.</p>
      <p>Some small businesses argue the bill would increase costs for store owners and shoppers.</p>
      <p>Democratic Sen. President Karen Spilka said she was inspired after a trip to Vancouver and Alaska this summer where she learned sea animals can starve to death because of the plastic in their stomachs.</p>
      <p>The Senate will debate the bill Wednesday.</p>
