      <p>Founder Jeff Abrams launched Rails in 2008 with no technical background in fashion and an investment of $5,000. Abrams has built a global brand that has generated more than $400 million dollars at retail. The label is stocked in more than 40 countries in stores such as Harvey Nichols, Harrods, Selfridges, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Intermix, and Shopbop.Known for its effortless California ease, mixed with a refined global look, each season the brand focuses on incorporating luxe fabrics. The company has also counts on celebrities including Kate Moss, Jessica Alba, or Gisele Bunchen as fans.</p>
      <p>"In the early days, our product range was focused almost exclusively in shirting," said Abrams. "Specifically our hero product: the Hunter Plaid. We gained notoriety for the super-luxe shirt that was like nothing else available. But season after season, we evolved the collection, creating related product categories such as jersey, knitwear, silks, dresses, and outerwear, always with our Rails handfeel in mind. Today we are a full collection, delivering our customers a full lifestyle collection of everyday essentials."</p>
      <p>It was always important to Abrams to create a collection that was not just an art project. "Every piece in the collection is meant to be wearable, versatile, and incredibly comfortable,” said said founder Jeff Abrams. "This meant focusing on classic silhouettes that could become core staples of any wardrobe, but developing them in our uniquely luxe fabrications."</p>
      <p>"In many ways the product led the global evolution,” said Abrams. "Retailers and customers were falling in love with the brand and helping us to introduce it to their local markets. There was also an element of sheer personal will and determination to build a global brand before even having a robust product assortment. I visited nearly every country where I was hoping to sell, I travelled to each store, I carried my samples around with me to meet store owners. Whether that meant driving all over the USA for three months and walking into stores unannounced, taking trains across Europe, flying to Australia, Japan, or Scandinavia, nothing was going to stop me from sharing the incredible product I knew we were creating. At our core, we are fabric innovators. We don’t buy available fabrics in the market, rather we custom develop yarn constructions, color palettes, and prints that reflect our brand DNA. Our silhouettes are effortless and meant to take you from day to night, or wherever your travels may lead you."</p>
      <p>Abrams said that he always made decisions based on the long-term success and protection of the Rails brand, not on financial benchmarks or growth targets. "Everything we do as a company is to create incredible product that delivers an emotional connection to our customer," said Abrams. "There is no blueprint for creating a successful fashion brand. It has been a combination of designing great products, supporting it with authentic marketing, building a talented team of people to help drive the business, and being relentlessly focused on improving the collections we deliver each season."</p>
      <p>Abrams notes that there has also been a level of sheer determination to be successful. "Like any start up endeavor, I had to wear many hats in the beginning: design, production, shipping, accounting," said Abrams. "It was at times an overwhelming task, but the early years helped define our direction and foster a grassroots company identity that we still carry today. It taught us to be nimble and react quickly to changing market demands. To make decisions with confidence and resolve, but to be flexible when evaluating their impact. To think creatively about how our products, marketing, and brand strategies could differentiate us from our competitors.”</p>
      <p>Abrams said that the greatest percentage of our business comes from the USA but notes that the international markets are quickly growing, with the UK being among their biggest international footprints. "We are selling in more than 90 specialties and better department stores in the UK, more than 70 stockists in France, 80+ in Scandinavia, 40 + in Southern Europe, along with strong distribution in Australia and Canada. Nearly 50% of our traffic on our Rails e-commerce channel comes from international markets. This is just the beginning of our international expansion and looks to build in new markets in Asia, the Middle East, and South America in the coming seasons."</p>
      <p>Abrams said that the brand is always focused first on product, and continuing to deliver collections season after season. "We have built an amazing global business over the years, primarily through the wholesale channel," said Abrams. "We are very excited to be adding a robust direct-to-consumer component to our brand. Our e-commerce platform has seen 50 percent year-over-year growth in 2019, and we are poised to grow direct-to-consumer by 65 percent in 2020. We are also opening our first brick and mortar flagship location in New York in Spring 2020, located on a premier corner in Soho across from Isabel Marant and Golden Goose. Shortly after we plan to open a flagship location in Los Angeles, with plans for international expansion by 2021, with London the likely first destination.</p>
