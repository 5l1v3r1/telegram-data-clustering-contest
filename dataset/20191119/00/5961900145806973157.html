      <h1>Qantas Is Slinging San Fran To Aus Return Flights For $300 So Tell Your Mate To Come Home</h1>

      <p>Yes, I also thought this was bullshit at first but nope – it’s actually real! To celebrate almost 100 years in the flying business, Qantas is releasing $100 one-way tickets from a number of destinations to Australia. FOR FOUR DAYS. Unfortunately, we (I) caught on to this late so there’s only three days left of the birthday sale. I apologise.</p>
      <p>Each day, the airline will release 100 airfares for $100^ each way when bought as a round trip. The fares are for selected city pairs and travel dates but still, what a bloody good deal.</p>
      <p>The first batch of flights unleashed on day one were London to Sydney tickets. It completely sold out. Shocker. But day two’s offer is San Francisco to Melbourne / Brisbane. Fares will be released at approximately 2pm PST / 5pm EST on 19 November 2019, so if you have any mates / family in San Fran right now that you haven’t seen for about a billion years, tag ’em. And because the departing location is San Francisco, these fares are in USD.</p>
      <p>As always, look out for the return blackout dates including 20 March-15 April 2020, 17 June-11 July 2020, and 11-28 September, 2020.</p>
      <p>If you do miss out on the birthday sale fares, Qantas is also offering economy round trips from Los Angeles to Sydney / Melbourne / Brisbane from $699. That’s still a damn good deal in my opinion. This sale ends Tuesday 26 November 2019, so you’ve got a week to get in touch with your loved ones.</p>
      <p>There’s still day three and four of the birthday sale to look forward to as well so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
      <p>You can suss out all the details on the Qantas website right <a href="https://www.qantas.com/us/en/promotions/birthday-sale.html">here</a>. You have to make the booking on qantas.com.</p>
