      <p>USD/JPY is flat in the Tokyo open, trading with a fraction of a percentage point to the downside, having stuck to a narrow 10-pip range between 108.60 and 108.70 so far. Fundamentally, USD/JPY has been capped on market's presuming a soft dollar policy from the US administration while trade talks between the US and China carry plenty of prospects for pitfalls despite the recent optimism for a trade deal. </p>
      <h3>Risk appetite was jolted by trade headlines</h3>
      <p>Overnight, risk appetite was jolted by the news that Trump and Fed Chairman Powell had met to discuss the strength of the dollar. At the same time, there were reports of a CNBC news that Chinese officials were concerned over prior comments with respect to tariffs from Trump, owing to his reluctance to roll back any tariffs that had already been marked – Subsequently, USD/JPY dropped from 109.05 early NY to just above 108.50. At the same time, USD/CNH bounced from 7.0185 to highs above 7.0300. As for US treasury yields, the US 2-year yields has been on the bid from 1.60% to 1.63% before falling back to 1.59% due to the US-China trade pessimism. The 10-year yields similarly fell from 1.85% to 1.80%. </p>
      <h4>USD/JPY levels</h4>
      <p>As or the technical outlook, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/usd-jpy-forecast-falls-below-10900-amid-safe-haven-demand-201911182026"><b>Valeria Bednarik</b></a>, the Chief Analyst at FXStret, explained that USD/JPY faced pressure and, unable to hold above the 200-day simple moving average, dropped from a daily peak of 109.07 to a low of 108.50:</p>
      <blockquote>"The technical picture remains neutral, with the pair trading within its recent range and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> flat in the 4-hour <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a>. In the daily chart, USD/JPY consolidates between the 100-day SMA, offering dynamic support at 107.70, and the 200-day SMA acting as <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> at 109.00. The pair would need a break of either side of this range to determine a longer-term bias.<br/><br/>On the upside, a breakout of 109.00 could lift the pair towards the 109.50 zone, ahead of the more significant area of 109.70-90, where the 100- and 200-week SMA offer strong resistance. On the downside, immediate support stands at last week’s low of 108.23, followed by the 108.00 psychological level."</blockquote>
