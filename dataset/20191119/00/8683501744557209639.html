      <p>It feels like 2019 has, literally and figuratively, been leading up to <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>. As the J.J. Abrams-helmed film is truly the end of an era, ready to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2454703/star-wars-episode-ix-is-confirmed-to-conclude-the-skywalker-saga">bring the Skywalker Saga to a proper close</a>, it looks like we’re getting the whole kitchen sink when it comes to this epic finale. And we can begin to see just how nuts it’s going to get with in the photo below, which shows Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron piloting the Millennium Falcon.</p>
      <p>If you’re a fan of excitement, joy, and probably fear of whatever’s emitting that red light, take a look below:</p>

      <p>Poe isn’t the only person in the cockpit of the Falcon who looks spooked by whatever’s facing them down, as Chewbacca has a pretty shocked expression on his face too. Though as for John Boyega’s Finn, the third party rounding out the trio that seems to be destined to be together throughout <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’s</i> course of adventure, he doesn’t seem as phased by the danger ahead as his compatriots.</p>
      <p>It feels like ever since Han Solo’s death in <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>, there have been quite a few people taking the wheel of the Millennium Falcon, a ship that used to be flown only by his capable hands. Not only have we now seen Poe Dameron flying the ship, thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5BCqyGHBLn/">this new photo from EW</a>, but <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483430/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-supercut-adds-final-trailer-footage">we’ve also already seen</a> Billy Dee Williams’ returning freedom fighter/lover Lando Calrissian assuming command of the ship he lost in that fateful game of cards at the end of <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>.</p>
      <p>And, of course, Daisy Ridley’s Rey kinda had the ship in her possession throughout all of <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i>, but seeing as she’s off doing important Jedi stuff that may or may not see her crossing paths with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478620/emperor-palpatines-instrumental-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-role-is-tied-to-redemption">the instrumental Emperor Palpatine</a>, she’s a little too busy for high flying adventure.</p>
      <p>But seeing Poe’s fear/exhilaration in this moment from <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> has us wondering, just what’s going on in this image? Is Poe going to be using The Falcon during the climactic battle that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482793/new-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-teaser-includes-a-cool-rebels-nod">may or may not have easter eggs</a> hidden in its lineup? Could this be a previous flight that doesn’t work out so well, putting this famed ship out of commission for the middle act of the film? Maybe Poe Dameron just left the parking break on, and he doesn’t know how to fly the ship of the Solos.</p>
      <p>Whatever the cause for this panic, we won’t have to wait too long to see <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> take the world to a galaxy far, far away one more time <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456842/new-movie-releases-2019-movie-release-date-schedule">on December 20.</a> But in the meantime, there are plenty of movies waiting for you in theaters, and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456842/new-movie-releases-2019-movie-release-date-schedule">the 2019 release schedule</a> will help you pick a couple to distract you between now and then.</p>
