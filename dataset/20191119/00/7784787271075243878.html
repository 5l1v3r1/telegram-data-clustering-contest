      <h1>The Blues made a HUGE draft move last year. So which clubs will do a deal in 2019?</h1>

      <h3>Sydney and West Coast will forever go down in history as the first club to make a live trade on AFL draft day.</h3>
      <p>But it’s the trade between Carlton and Adelaide which will be talked about for decades, after the Blues made a bold call to snap up Liam Stocker during the frantic final hour of the first day of the 2018 national draft.</p>
      <p>Clubs are always looking to improve their draft hand, with the phones running hot as the days tick down until the draft.</p>
      <p><i>Foxfooty.com.au</i> looks at the potential trades we could see in the 2019 draft.</p>

        <b>GIANTS JUMP INTO TOP FIVE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Giants have long been linked with a move into the top-five on draft night. The major reason behind the potential move is for the club to gain another selection before having to match a bid on Patrick Cripps clone, Tom Green. The GWS Academy star was named in the All-Australian team after averaging 23.8 disposals and eight clearances during the Under 18 Championships for the Allies.</p>
      <p>Currently GWS has Pick 6 in their disposal, but it would be wiped if a club ahead of them bidded on Green. Adelaide (Pick 4) appears to be the club most likely to do a deal if the Giants come to the them, with a future pick needing to be involved. Sydney at Pick 5 continue to be linked with a bid, considering Green could well be a replacement for Josh Kennedy.</p>

      <p>The Crows have been linked with Vic Country’s Sam Flanders and tall Fischer McAsey, while the Swans could select Caleb Serong.</p>
      <p>However, despite this deal being talked for a number of weeks, there is no guarantee it will be struck — with the Giants potentially taking a gamble on no club bidding on Green before Pick 6.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEES AND BLUES SLIDE BACK, CATS AND SUNS MOVE FORWARD</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two most gettable picks inside top-10 are Melbourne’s Pick 8 and Carlton’s Pick 9. Geelong (Pick 14) is among the clubs aiming of securing a single digit selection, with the Cats looking for a business partner. The club would love a key position target, with Fischer McAsey in their sights if they can get above rival teams and leap into the top 10.</p>
      <p>Both South Australian clubs have been linked to McAsey, along with the Gold Coast Suns. Melbourne or Carlton could deal with the Suns, allowing one of the Victorian clubs to secure small forward Kysaiah Pickett in the second-half of the first round.</p>

        <b>WHO WILL GIVE UP A 2020 FIRST ROUND PICK?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-draft-2019-live-trading-port-adelaide-brisbane-lions-afl-trades-jackson-mead/news-story/61f5fb016700ff638749c0b5f1c754fe">We’ve already seen Port Adelaide trade out of the 2020 first round, with the club dealing with Brisbane on Monday</a>. It means the Lions will hold the Power’s pick for next season, cheering on all of their opposition as they hope to get a low pick.</p>
      <p>A number of other clubs are jostling to get another selection in the 10-20 range of this year’s draft, with future scouts suggesting the 2020 draft pool isn’t as classy. Next year’s draft will be the most compromised draft we have ever had, with a good chunk of the best prospects linked with the 18 clubs as either a father-son player or next-generation academy players.</p>
      <p>One potential snag is an AFL regulation regarding the trading of future picks.</p>
      <p>“If a club trades a future first-round selection, it may not trade any other future selection from that same draft,” the AFL regulations read.</p>
      <p>“But if a club keeps its future first-round selection, it can trade any of its future selections from other rounds.”</p>
