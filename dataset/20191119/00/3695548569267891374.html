        <b>The new point to be given to Formula E drivers topping group running in qualifying sessions will add an extra dynamic in 2019-20, says BMW Andretti team boss Roger Griffiths.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the three points given to the driver earning pole position in superpole session, the driver that sets the fastest time in the combined order of the four championship-order groups will also get one point per qualifying session from the start of the upcoming campaign.</p>
      <p>This point will replace the second extra point that was awarded to the driver setting the fastest lap, which has resulted in one point since the 2016-17 season after being worth two in FE's first two championships.</p>
      <p>"It gives you something to shoot for - it does make qualifying all the more important," Griffiths told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"Often you see the fastest guy in the group session doesn't necessarily always end up on getting the superpole [pole].</p>
      <p>"We talked about different things - it is a reward for doing well within the group sessions so I think everyone was happy with the way it came out.</p>
      <p>"This is another example of 'let's find a good solution together' to, I wouldn't say a problem, but a situation that we have and how we can do something that works for the championship.</p>
      <p>"[It] also create a story point as well because we could [just say] 'oh let's just give an extra point to the guy that wins the race' or something, well where's the story there?"</p>

      <p>FE was briefly set to drop the fastest lap point in favour of a reward for the most energy-efficient driver, but this idea <a href="https://www.autosport.com/fe/news/139478/fe-will-not-give-bonus-best-effeciency-point">did not go ahead last season</a>.</p>
      <p>But Audi driver Lucas di Grassi reckons "this [group qualifying] point will never go to the top six guys" in the championship, who have to run in the opening qualifying group.</p>
      <p>"Never, ever, will any of the top six [be] the fastest in [group] qualifying overall," di Grassi told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"It's extremely hard to be the first so this point will always good to the guys more in group three or four."</p>
      <p>Di Grassi also wants FE to introduce a different form of session to set the grid as "nobody watches qualifying".</p>
      <p>"I like the philosophy of qualifying again because it'll make the championship compact. But I think the [four] groups of six minutes, I think that's too boring," he added.</p>
      <p>"If it was up to me I would do one lap [per driver] like superpole.</p>
      <p>"No superpole [session], just one lap - everybody starting from the championship leader to the end, one by one.</p>
      <p>"They will argue it's longer, it's not, you can use two minutes a driver and it's still 48 minutes."</p>
