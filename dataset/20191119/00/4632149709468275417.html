      <p>Like we told you over the weekend, there’s a lot more to the upcoming FiveSixZero fest than a concert. It will also host a two-day music summit. Under its ‘Masterclass’ property, you can listen to stalwarts share their secrets about production, mixing and mastering, composing &amp; arranging, pioneer equipment features and more. Whereas, the ‘Pitch Demo’ is a space where music-makers can drop their demo to record labels and get feedback from producers. <br/><br/>On the line-up are Ricky Kej, Miguel Pardo, Brian Tellis, Tessa Sprangemeijer, and these other speakers. <br/><br/><b>Justine Servais</b> <br/>She has numerous years of PR and branding experience under her belt. She has arranged PR and organised events for several clubs in London’s Soho region as well as album releases/showcases for various live acts (such as MGMT, Viktoria Modesta, The Charlatans), handled promotion for fashion brands such as Bas Kosters and Vlieger &amp; Vandam, and is a valued member of Armada Music as its international PR &amp; promotion manager. Since she joined Armada team in 2016, she has worked with and for acts such as 3LAU, Afrojack, Autograf, Borgore, Cedric Gervais, Fedde Le Grand, Kidnap, Lost Frequencies, LoudLuxury, Mokita, NERVO, Showtek, Sunnery James &amp; Ryan Marciano, Youngr and more. She is also the co-founder of She Said So Amsterdam (a local branch of the global She Said So), which is a highly curated network of music industry professionals that strives for diversity and quality. <br/><br/><b>David Van Luijn</b> <br/>He is the head of online marketing for Armada Music and as a data-driven digital marketing leader, his management and budgeting skills are well proven. He is someone who always sees the bigger picture, and knows how to communicate to different stakeholders. <br/><br/><b>Ankush Bahugana</b> <br/>He is a multi-potentialist. From being an architecture student to making people fall in love with his entertaining skills, Bahugana has come a long way in his life as a video content creator, actor and director for channels such as MensXP and Restless Mind. Growing up, he was an <br/>introvert as well as socially awkward. But it was acting that helped him find that confidence. <br/><br/><br/><b>Anushka Manchanda</b> <br/>She is a fiercely independent and ever-evolving artist. She is a singer, songwriter, performer, activist, actor and now the head of music at IncInk Records, an independent music label and creative collective. Alongside the accolades, she is, you’d know already, among the loudest voices in India, bringing awareness to animal rights and the environment through her work, be it participating in the ‘Save Aarey’ forest movement or her campaign for sustainable living. <br/><br/>Attend the FiveSixZero music summit and fest from November 22 to 24, at The Lalit Ashok, Kumarakrupa Road, tickets on bookmyshow.com, details on fivesixzero.in <br/><br/><b>To feature an event on this page, send the details and photographs to mybangaloremirror@timesgroup.com with the subject line ‘Unwind’</b></p>
