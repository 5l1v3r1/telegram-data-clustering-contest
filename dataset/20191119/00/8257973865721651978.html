      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Showtime said it has ordered a pilot for <i>Big Deal</i>, a half-hour comedy starring and co-created by <i>Saturday Night Live</i> alum Vanessa Bayer.</p>
      <p>Jessi Klein -- whose credits include <i>Inside <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Amy_Schumer/?tps=1">Amy Schumer</a></i> and <i>Big Mouth</i> -- will serve as show-runner.</p>
      <p><i>The Big Sick</i> director Michael Showalter is to helm the first episode.</p>
      <p>The series is loosely based on Bayer's own past as a childhood leukemia survivor. Her fictionalized character overcomes illness and achieves her lifelong dream of being a QVC host.</p>
      <p>"Vanessa Bayer is such a sharp and joyful comic talent, and in <i>Big Deal</i> she mines the story of her own life to deliver hard comedy with deep resonance," Gary Levine, president of entertainment at Showtime Networks, said in a statement.</p>
