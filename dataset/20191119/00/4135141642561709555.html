      <h1>Williams, Fuller among Chiefs’ inactives in Mexico City</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:43:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:43</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p>MEXICO CITY — Left tackle Russell Okung is out for a second straight week as the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/los-angeles-chargers-team">Los Angeles Chargers</a> face the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs-team">Kansas City Chiefs</a> at Azteca Stadium on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Okung has a groin injury that kept him out against Oakland 11 days ago, and he hadn’t improved enough to face the Chiefs (6-4) in a vital game for the Chargers’ (4-6) playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>Running back <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/damien-williams-player-stats">Damien Williams</a> and cornerback <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/kendall-fuller-player-stats">Kendall Fuller</a> were notable inactives for the Chiefs. Williams missed practices last week for personal reasons but was expected to travel to Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Williams has 302 yards rushing and three touchdowns this season. He has more carries than <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/lesean-mccoy-player-stats">LeSean McCoy</a>, who was active in Mexico after being a healthy scratch last week.</p>
      <p>Also inactive for the Chiefs, DE <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/alex-okafor-player-stats">Alex Okafor</a>, TE <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/blake-bell-player-stats">Blake Bell</a>, OL <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/nick-allegretti-player-stats">Nick Allegretti</a>, OL <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/jackson-barton-player-stats">Jackson Barton</a>, RB <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/darwin-thompson-player-stats">Darwin Thompson</a>, QB <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/chad-henne-player-stats">Chad Henne</a>.</p>
      <p>Also inactive for the Chargers, OL Sam Tevi, WR Geremy Davis, RB Justin Jackson, LB Drue Tranquill, DT T.Y. McGill Jr., QB Easton Stick.</p>
