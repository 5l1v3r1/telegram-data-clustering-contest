      <p>After closing the season in the best possible way with the double victory in MotoE™, the Reale Avintia Racing Team is pleased to announce a contract extension for the next two seasons with Ducati. Switching to the Italian manufacturer halfway through 2014, strong top four performances and even a front row have seen the partnership flourish in recent season.</p>
      <p>The structure will see the Reale Avintia Racing Team enjoy satellite equipment of the Italian manufacturer and will have significant improvements that will allow the team to make another leap in quality with the aim of being a reference team in the paddock. The team will have two GP19 motorcycles in the garage for 2020 and enjoy technical help from the Ducati factory in Bologna.</p>
