      </p>
      <p><b>Mick McCarthy</b> remains confident his <b>Republic </b>of <b>Ireland </b>squad can book a place at<b> Euro 2020 </b>despite missing out on automatic qualification.</p>
      <p>Ireland were<b> held to a 1-1 draw in Monday's</b> <b>must-win qualifier </b>against Denmark at the Aviva Stadium to finish third in Group D, three points behind their opponents.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Doherty headed home five minutes</b> from time to cancel out Martin Braithwaite's 73rd-minute opener, but McCarthy's men must settle for a play-off spot.</p>
      <p>A one-legged semi-final and final will be played in March and McCarthy believes his side are in with a shot, provided they replicate their performance against Denmark.</p>
      <p>"We can beat anyone in the play-offs," he told Sky Sports.Â </p>
      <p>"The players will go back to their clubs and we don't have a game until March. I'll be getting round them and reminding them it has been a good campaign and that we can play like that, so why not play like that in March."</p>
      <p>Ireland lost only one of their eight qualifiers - a 2-0 reverse to Switzerland last month - and McCarthy was full of praise for his players after the draw with the Danes in Dublin.</p>

      <p>"I am immensely proud of them," he said. "They pushed Denmark right to the limit. If my players and my team leave everything on the pitch, I will take the result as it comes so I will have to take this.</p>
      <p>"You just need that bit of luck. We had opportunities but I am not going to criticise the lads because they've been brilliant. We lost one game out of eight so I'm very proud of them."</p>
      <p>Denmark are now unbeaten in 17 qualifying matches since October 2016 and can look forward to next year's tournament, having failed to qualify last time around.</p>
      <p>Age Hareide's men managed just two attempts on target against Ireland, however, and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel admitted his side were "terrible".</p>
      <p>"It was dramatic enough," he told Sky Sports. "There wasn't a lot of quality from both sides - it was a cagey and tight affair.</p>
      <p>"We were terrible. We didn't hit anything we tried to today and we had to rely on our grit and determination. We needed it today as we were under a lot of pressure."</p>
      <p>Denmark have faced Ireland six times since 2017 and have not lost any of those meetings, but Schmeichel feels the hosts are improving.</p>
      <p>"This is the best Ireland have been against us," Schmeichel added. "We had to ride our luck at times, but you need that when you're fighting for qualification."</p>
