      <h1>Valve Announced Its VR Title ‘Half-Life: Alyx’, And That’s Really Exciting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Parlock</a></address>
      <p>Following <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeparlock/2019/11/18/valves-vr-project-is-allegedly-half-life-alyx-to-be-teased-at-this-years-game-awards/#86d187b45488">leaks yesterday</a>, Valve has officially confirmed that its first flagship VR project is, indeed, <i>Half-Life: Alyx. </i>Tweeting from a relatively new, but verified, Twitter account, Valve announced that we’ll be seeing the game a little bit earlier than the previously rumored Game Awards on December 12. Instead, we’ll have our first look of it this Thursday, November 21, at 10am Pacific Time.</p>
      <p>Other than that, we don’t have any information about the game. Going off of the name it’s bound to involve <i>Half-Life 2’s </i>deutragonist Alyx Vance. It’d be cool if we’re able to play as her, but in VR simply interacting with her would equally be good. Considering the technical goal of <i>Half-Life 2: Episode 1 </i>way back in 2006 was realistic interactions with Alyx, an expansion of that would be very interesting indeed.</p>
      <p>Of course, this announcement has rustled a few feathers. Writing right here on Forbes, for instance, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/18/valve-just-announced-a-new-half-life-game-but-not-the-one-we-wanted/#18f6005770d1">Erik Kain argues</a> that this announcement is a disappointment, as it is the first <i>Half-Life </i>game in years, only for it to then be a VR-focused title. Let me just be clear in that Erik is absolutely entitled to feel disappointed by this announcement (personally I’d have preferred a <i>Portal </i>or even <i>Left 4 Dead </i>VR title over <i>Half-Life</i>), and neither of us know what the game even is yet. It’s fair to be skeptical!</p>
      <p>However, there are a couple of things to consider. Firstly, <i>Half-Life: Alyx </i>wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t a VR title. It isn’t as though Valve had a perfectly working flat game and decided to butcher it into a hamfisted VR title; as Valve’s Robin Walker allegedly says in the leaked interview, this started life as a VR project from the outset, building on Steam VR technology (and more than likely with a hefty amount of Index-specific functionality like finger tracking).</p>
      <p>Secondly, Erik raises the argument that VR is little more than a novelty. A “thing you show your friends and then forget about until more friends come over and want to see what all the fuss is about. It is no kind of replacement for traditional gaming”.</p>
      <p>I agree with that last sentiment. I don’t think VR will ever replace flat-screen gaming, and I don’t think that’s even the intention among most VR developers. However, how can VR move beyond being seen as a novelty if the first thing people say in response to any attempts to do so is “well VR’s only good for showing to friends”? Erik himself ponders “will it be a total waste of resources when they could be making an incredible FPS instead”, as if ‘VR’ and ‘incredible FPS’ as somehow mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p>How can VR get the larger titles that prove it can be a viable gaming platform if nobody develops those larger titles in the first place? Arguing a large-scale VR game is disappointing because VR gaming is defined by smaller, novelty experiences is a circular argument.</p>
      <p>Consider Valve’s primary competitor in the VR space, Oculus. Up to now, Valve’s been primarily focusing on the hardware and development tools, rather than the software. Valve has been all in on VR for years, so it developing games for VR should not come as any surprise. It developed the Vive with HTC, then released the Index on its own. It created the Steam VR backend, and VR games have a huge presence on Steam. Couple that with the increasing adoption rates of VR this year thanks to things like the Oculus Quest and Rift S, and it’s plain to see why Valve wants to push some of its own games out there to cement itself as a presence in VR.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Oculus has been throwing its Facebook money around to lap up first-party titles like <i>Robo Recall, Lone Echo, Stormland </i>and <i>Asgard’s Wrath </i>to position itself as both a developer of VR tech <i>and </i>a publisher of VR games. Valve’s finally stepping up to the plate and putting the resources into trying to match Oculus’ content output, and for VR that can only be a good thing.</p>
      <p>Yes, to many this will be a disappointment, and that is understandable. A new <i>Half-Life </i>game… but on hardware they don’t like, don’t own, or can’t afford, that is disappointing! However, framing that distaste as an inditement on VR in general, when the investment made by Valve with this announcement clearly says otherwise, feels short-sighted and wrong to me.</p>
      <p>Unless <i>Half-Life: Alyx </i>turns out to be as bad as <i>Artifact </i>was. Then I might reconsider both Valve and this whole VR thing.</p>
