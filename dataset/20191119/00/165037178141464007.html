        <b>Italy coach Roberto Mancini believes rivals would prefer to avoid playing his team at Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Roberto Mancini </b>is unsure if rivals are <b>worried about Italy ahead of Euro 2020</b>, but feels they may prefer to avoid playing his side at the tournament.</p>
      <p>Italy completed a perfect qualifying campaign in Group J with a<b> 9-1 demolition of Armenia</b> in Palermo on Monday.</p>
      <p>While their<b> impressive performances</b> are sure to see them considered among the favourites at next year's showpiece tournament, Mancini feels other nations are ahead of Italy in their growth.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if they are worried or not," the Italy coach told a news conference.</p>
      <p>"I think they are stronger because they are one step ahead with their plan. France started some years ago, they reached a Euro final and won the World Cup. They are young and I think they are one of the strongest teams. Spain the same.</p>
      <p>"Belgium in the last five, six years produced a lot of outstanding talents. Then England.</p>
      <p>"All those teams stared earlier. Italy has a great history. I don't think other teams will face Italy easily.</p>

      <p>"Maybe they are not scared, buy if they could choose would face another opponent instead of Italy."</p>
      <p>Ciro Immobile and Nicolo Zaniolo scored braces against Armenia, while Nicolo Barella, Alessio Romagnoli, Jorginho, Riccardo Orsolini and Federico Chiesa were also on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>Mancini praised his players for their improvement and hopes there is more to come from Italy at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>"These are all young lads who are improving game by game. Playing at international level brings experience, they've got the quality, it's just a matter of time," he told Rai Sport.</p>
      <p>"Weâ€™ll see what happens at Euro 2020. We'd never won all 10 games in a qualifying group, we've got six months to prepare for the championship and unfortunately I will have to leave some behind, as I can only bring 23 players.</p>
      <p>"If we can continue like this, that would be great."</p>
      <p>The draw for the final tournament will be held on November 30.</p>
