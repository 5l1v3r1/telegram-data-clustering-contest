        <b>IRISH COMEDIAN Brendan O’Carroll has lifted the lid on the life-changing experience that saw him come perilously close to suffering a massive heart attack.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to <a href="https://extra.ie/2019/11/19/entertainment/celebrity/brendan-ocarroll-heart-attack-scare"><i><b>Extra.ie</b></i></a>, the Mrs Brown’s Boys star revealed how a series of tests for another ailment revealed the serious underlying condition.</p>
      <p>O’Carroll had first attended an appointment at Beacon Hospital in Dublin after experiencing an issue with arteries in his leg which left him struggling to walk.</p>
      <p>“I told them my story and they said they were going to do about 10 different tests,” O’Carroll recalled.</p>
      <p>“And we did them all that day and at one stage he had to put me under an anesthetic and, when I woke up, Jenny was there and she said: ‘he found a blockage in your heart, he had to put a stent in.’</p>
      <p>“I was in overnight and the next morning [the doctor] said he had found an artery that was 99% blocked and that I was one month away from a heart attack, which shocked me.”</p>

      <p>The Irish comedy star later learned that his doctor had seen him recently on the Late Late Show and, after remembering how he had looked short of breath, carried out a series of tests.</p>
      <p>It emerged that O’Carroll had been ill for several months with the ill-effects of his increasingly blocked artery impacting his appearance and general well-being.</p>
      <p>Thankfully the Mrs Brown’s Boys creator has been given a clean bill of health, with the blockage successfully removed.</p>
      <p>O’Carroll is now determined to do his part to raise awareness of these kinds of conditions.</p>
      <p>That’s why he’s launched the Mrs. Brown’s Boys FAI Heart Care Programme designed to to screen adults in Ireland for heart issues and Sudden Adult Death Syndrome.</p>
