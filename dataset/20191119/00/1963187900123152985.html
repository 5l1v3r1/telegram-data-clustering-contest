      <p>CAIRO- 19 November 2019: “Development in Africa will have its impact on the Mediterrenean region and will achieve mutual interests,” President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi said in his speech at the opening of the G20-Initiative Compact with Africa (CwA) held in Germany Tuesday. <br/><br/>“As protectionism is ascending and slowdown of global trade is arising, African states are likely to suffer the most, particularly in light of problems like debts, poverty, climate change, and diseases. Africa’s location, resources, continental free trade agreement, and rise of intra-continental trade still make it an attractive investment destination,” President Sisi stressed. <br/><br/>President Abdel Fatah El Sisi and German President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Schäuble tackled international efforts of counterterrorism and the illegal migration issue at the Bundestag headquarters in Berlin on Monday, Egyptian Presidential Spokesperson Bassam Radi said in a statement. The meeting also tackled the Egyptian efforts in disseminate the culture of forgiveness and freedom of belief, Radi said. <br/><br/>German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier commended on Monday the pivotal role played by Egypt to boost stability in the Middle East and Africa, especially with regard to combating illegal migration and terrorism. <br/><br/>President Sisi held extended talks with his German counterpart, during which the Egyptian leader praised relations between Cairo and, which he said have strengthened to a high level over the past years. <br/><br/>Sisi also expressed his appreciation for Germany's handing over of an ancient 19th century Atlas. In October, Egyptian Culture Minister Inas Abdel Dayem received the ancient relic from Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and his German counterpart Heiko Mass in the presence of Hisham Azmi, president of the Egyptian National Library and Archives. <br/><br/>Steinmeier also hailed the steps that Egypt adopted to reform its economy, and the mega national projects that are being extensively erected in the country. He asserted Germany's keenness to support Egypt's development efforts in all fields through joint investments. <br/><br/>The meeting also tackled some regional and international issues of common interest, in particular the Libyan and Syrian crises, the spokesman said. The two leaders also discussed the Palestinian cause, with both of them agreeing on the need to reach a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with relevant international terms of reference. <br/><br/>Since its launch in 2017, 12 African countries joined the initiative including Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Tunisia, according to the official website of the initiative. <br/><br/>In Berlin, the Compact with Africa High-Level Conference and G20 Investment Summit, which focuses on the German business with CwA countries, will convene on November 19. Two days later, Frankfurt will host a seminar that sheds light on investment opportunities and challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
