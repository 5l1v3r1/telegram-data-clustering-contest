        <b><b>Sudharak Olwe </b>has been documenting the lives of Mumbai's sanitation workers for about two decades.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The work, often in appalling conditions, is reserved for Scheduled Castes, officially designated groups of historically disadvantaged communities that live on the fringes of society.</p>
      <p>And their lives remain substantially unchanged despite India's overall economic, social and technological advancements.</p>
      <p>Olwe's most recent photographs, commissioned by WaterAid, are shown as part of UN World Toilet Day 2019.</p>

      <p>Betibai Valmiki says: "We are not allowed to drink tea in any restaurant here.</p>
      <p>"Even if we go to one small tea-shop, we are served in disposable plastic glasses while others are served in regular tumblers."</p>
      <p>Most of the women have asthma and malaria - but there is no healthcare and their wages are docked if they call in sick.</p>

      <p>"What other option do we have?" she asks.</p>
      <p>"Even if we open a shop, no-one would buy from us because we are Valmikis."</p>

      <p>Santosh works in Amanganj with his wife and two sons.</p>
      <p>In 1992, he nearly drowned cleaning a septic tank with colleagues, one of whom died.</p>
      <p>It was much deeper than they had been told.</p>
      <p>But despite his eyes being permanently damaged, he has never received any compensation.</p>
      <p>Printed on the back of his jacket are the words "Being Human".</p>

      <p>"There is hardly any respect in it," Geeta says.</p>
      <p>"We are treated so badly. It's such a thankless job."</p>

      <p>In April last year, the Dom community on the outskirts of Thillai Gaon, Bihar, lost 10 houses and most of their cattle in a fire.</p>
      <p>They work in nearby Sasaram but, having lost their ID and ration cards, received no help or compensation.</p>

      <p>Meenadevi, 58, carries excrement from a Muslim neighbourhood in Rohtas.</p>
      <p>She started working as a manual scavenger 25 years ago with her mother-in-law.</p>
      <p>"Initially, I used to feel nauseated," she says.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't ready and felt ashamed to work because of the stigma attached to it.</p>
      <p>"But now I'm used to the foul smells.</p>
      <p>"Poverty leaves you with no option.</p>

      <p>"My mother-in-law died doing this job.</p>
      <p>"She used to carry the sewage in tin cans. I did the same.</p>
      <p>"Now, we don't use tin cans. Nonetheless, the same fate awaits me,"</p>
