      <h1>Inter Milan, Juventus 'consider Chris Smalling offers'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/"><b>Inter Milan</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> are reportedly both weighing up offers for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-smalling/"><b>Chris Smalling</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 29-year-old joined <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/roma/"><b>Roma</b></a> on loan during the summer transfer window and has been in impressive form for the Italian side this season, starting their last eight Serie A matches.</p>
      <p>Roma <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/roma-table-offer-for-chris-smalling_377102.html">are said</a> to be keen to complete a permanent deal for the centre-back next summer, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-united-want-gbp18m-for-chris-smalling_379698.html">United signalling</a> that they would be prepared to sell for a figure in the region of Â£18m.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Corriere della Sera</i>, both Inter and Juve are circling as Smalling has impressed many with his displays in Italy's top flight this term.</p>
      <p>The former non-league defender has a contract with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a>'s side until the end of the 2021-22 campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-maguire/"><b>Harry Maguire</b></a>'s summer arrival pushed Smalling down the pecking order at Old Trafford, although the Englishman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/smalling-reveals-solskjaer-texts-amid-transfer-talk_376985.html">recently hinted</a> that he does still have a future in Manchester.</p>
