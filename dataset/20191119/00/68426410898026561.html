      <p>The Trans Mountain pipeline received $320-million in subsidies from the Canadian and Alberta governments in the first half of 2019, says a new report by an economic institute that analyzes environmental issues.</p>
      <p>The money included $135.8-million in direct subsidies and $183.8-million in indirect subsidies that were not clearly disclosed to taxpayers, says the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.</p>
      <p>“This is a very large subsidy. It really does require more public discussion and public disclosure,” says Tom Sanzillo, the group’s director of finance.</p>
      <p>Sanzillo and the report’s co-author, institute financial analyst Kathy Hipple, analyzed the second-quarter report of the Canada Development Investment Corp., a Crown corporation meant to further the country’s economic development that counts Trans Mountain Corp. among its subsidiaries.</p>
      <p>The document is public but presents a consolidated picture of the development corporation’s finances, including revenues from the Canada Hibernia Holding Corp., which operates the Crown’s interest in oil reserves off Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
      <p>This accounting treatment obscures the real financial state of Trans Mountain, Sanzillo says.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good form of accounting. I’m not criticizing it. It just shouldn’t be the only mechanism for showing the public how much money is being spent on this,” he says.</p>
      <p>The Canadian government gave the development corporation just over $5-billion to finance the acquisition of Trans Mountain, the report says. Trans Mountain Corp. must make regular interest payments to the Canadian government at a rate of 4.7 per cent.</p>
      <p>The cash was provided to Trans Mountain in two sections: a $2.8-billion loan and a $2.3-billion equity investment. The interest on the loan must be paid from the pipeline’s business activity, while the interest on the equity investment can be paid from a third-party subsidy, the report says.</p>
      <p>The Canada Hibernia Holding Corp. covered the interest on the equity investment for the first half of 2019, representing a direct subsidy of $46.3-million, the report says.</p>
      <p>Trans Mountain posted a $10.9-million loss in this reporting period prior to taxes, the report says.</p>
      <p>However, the loss is subsidized in the consolidated financial report by the Hibernia corporation’s earnings, amounting to another $10.9-million direct subsidy, the report says.</p>
      <p>Sanzillo also says the development corporation uses an “accounting gimmick” to obscure Trans Mountain’s pension liability of $24.4-million. This is one more direct subsidy, he says.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Alberta government reduced corporate taxes through a tax credit starting in January 2019. This policy action allowed Trans Mountain to save $54.1-million in taxes, yet another direct subsidy that the development corporation uses to turn the corporation’s pre-tax loss into a post-tax gain, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Sanzillo also identifies what he calls an indirect subsidy; the difference between the interest a private company would have charged Trans Mountain versus the rate charged by the Canadian government.</p>
      <p>Canada’s 4.7 per cent interest rate stands in contrast with the 12 to 15 per cent rate of return used by its former owner, Kinder Morgan, the report says.</p>
      <p>Sanzillo used the lower figure, 12 per cent, to calculate that a private company would have charged Trans Mountain $302.1-million in interest in the first half of 2019. The Canadian government, meanwhile, charged it $118.3-million.</p>
      <p>That amounts to an indirect subsidy of $183.8-million for the first six months of the year, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The report authors acknowledge that the Canadian government does not have to adhere to commercial standards.</p>
      <p>“(The report) is about transparency and not meant to be a legal challenge to the right of the Canadian government to subsidize the pipeline project. It is a matter of dollars at risk that the Canadian taxpayer might absorb,” it says.</p>
      <p>When the authors added the $46.3-million interest payment and the $24.4-million pension expense back to Trans Mountain’s financials, they concluded the pipeline corporation had a $67.1-million pre-tax loss and a $12.9-million loss after taxes.</p>
      <p>The Canadian government plans to ultimately sell the pipeline. If it does so for a lower price than it paid for the infrastructure, it can legally forgive any debt that is left over, Sanzillo adds.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Press was unable to reach out to the Department of Finance and Trans Mountain Corp. for reaction until the group’s report was published Tuesday morning.</p>
