      <p>The <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/charlotte-hornets">Hornets</a> were supposed to suck more than this! After losing Kemba and replacing him with no better than the third-best Terry in the league, the Hornets seems destined for the same tier of the East as like, the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/new-york-knicks">Knicks</a>.</p>
      <p>They still might be just that. Wins over the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/chicago-bulls">Bulls</a>, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/sacramento-kings">Kings</a>, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/golden-state-warriors">Warriors</a>, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/indiana-pacers">Pacers</a>, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/detroit-pistons">Pistons</a> and Knicks don’t exactly preclude them from a nose-dive in the near future. And it may start tonight!</p>
      <p>Toronto returns home after a mostly successful and entirely inspiring five-game swing out west. They’re still down <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/152220/kyle-lowry">Kyle Lowry</a>, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296655/serge-ibaka">Serge Ibaka</a> and <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/276625/patrick-mccaw">Patrick McCaw</a>, but if <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/199151/nick-nurse">Nick Nurse</a>’s Frankenstein ass rotation could pull out wins over the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a> and Blazers while hanging with the Clips and Mavs, the team whose best player might be Devonte’ Graham shouldn’t pose any sort of insurmountable test.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/255248/stanley-johnson">Stanley Johnson</a> was ruled out a couple hours before game time due to a left groin stress reaction. There’s a joke here that I’m not sharp enough to find right now. Either way, that absence doesn’t figure to matter even one iota.</p>
      <p>Enjoy the game! Here’s hoping <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/276639/pascal-siakam">Pascal Siakam</a> causes YOU to have a left groin stress reaction.</p>
      <p>There it is.</p>
