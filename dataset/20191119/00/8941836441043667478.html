      <p>HOMOSASSA, Fla. (AP) - A retired banker and wealthy philanthropist who lost his bid to be mayor of Tampa earlier this year has died.</p>
      <p>Seventy-six-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-straz/">David Straz</a> was found dead Monday near Homosassa, about 75 miles (117 kilometers) north of Tampa. According to the Tampa Bay Times, his spokesman Jarrod Holbrook says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-straz/">Straz</a> was on a fishing trip with close friends when he was found.</p>
      <p>Jane Castor beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-straz/">Straz</a> earlier this year in a runoff. The mayor said on Twitter, “I’m saddened to hear about the passing of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-straz/">Mr. Straz</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-straz/">David</a>’s indelible contributions to this city will be a part of our cultural fabric for decades to come.”</p>
