      <h1>Apple December New York Event: Exactly What Will Be Revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">David Phelan</a></address>
      <p>Apple is holding an event in New York City on Monday, December 2. The exact time and venue are still to be made public, and indeed the initial invites sent to select journalists were apparently meant to be kept under wraps. But things have a habit of leaking out, this time because one invitee tweeted about the event (and the fact that he’d been invited).</p>
      <p>Here’s all the evidence and everything you need to know.</p>

        <b>Apple often has a second Fall event – it didn’t this year</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, while Apple visited New York last October for a big iPad Pro launch event, there was nothing like that this year. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2019/11/18/black-friday-2019-latest-wearables-deals-apple-watch-airpods-walmart-amazon-best-buy-bh/">Black Friday 2019 Latest Wearables Deals: Apple Watch, AirPods<br/>Forbes David Phelan</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>So, is that what this is? Will there be lots of new hardware?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In short, no, and no. </p>
      <p>The main hardware reveals for 2019 have almost certainly happened. The new MacBook Pro 16in model was announced to the press in a behind-closed-doors session last week and there was a similar small-scale reveal of the latest wireless headphones, AirPods Pro, at the end of October. </p>
      <p>So, Apple is making clear that its major products can be unveiled in quiet ways. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Well, this sounds like it could be quite quiet, so…</b>
      </p>
      <p>I hear what you’re saying but still no, I’m afraid. </p>
      <p>Take a look at the invite. A big, golden App Store symbol with the words “Join us for an Apple special event honoring our favorite apps and games of 2019.”</p>
      <p>Honestly, it just couldn’t be any clearer than that. And given Apple is always good at gnomic invitation headlines when it wants to be coy, there’s really no mistaking this. Also, the timing is right.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Timing for what?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every December, Apple announces its Best Of The Year awards. You can see <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2018/12/04/apple-reveals-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2018-for-iphone-ipad-mac/#954871838ce3">what I wrote about that here</a>. It happened in December last year, too. It’s a cool way of focusing on some of the best apps – with so many releasing all the time, it’s easy to miss plenty of good stuff.</p>

      <p>Oh, and here’s a bit more evidence: check out the images Apple used last year to memorialize the winning items. They have more than a passing resemblance to that gold App Store icon this time around, no?</p>

      <p>
        <b>Is there anything different about this invite?</b>
      </p>
      <p>What’s different this time around is Apple is, it seems throwing a little party to celebrate the announcement, as characterized by the slogan on the invite, “Loved by millions. Created by the Best.” And why not? Sounds like a fun party. If it’s strictly press-only we may not hear much more about it, but if there’s a bigger shindig to go with it, well, Apple’s pretty good at throwing a party…</p>

      <p>
        <b>How about one more thing?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You won’t be told, will you? Look, of course, I could be completely wrong but I don’t believe there will be a new product of any kind at this event. The invite would be more cryptic, for a start. </p>
      <p>And it’s just the wrong time of year to launch something new and catch the holiday trade. So, no. Got it?</p>
      <p>As more details appear, I’ll be updating this post and, of course, covering the apps and games that are honored as soon as we know. </p>
