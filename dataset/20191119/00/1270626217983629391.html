      <p>Arpana Pratap who has accused her former partner of attempting to kill her has told the Suva High Court that she knew he was trying to kill her when he allegedly intentionally pushed her into the water.</p>
      <p>Responding to questions by the Prosecution lawyer, Pratap told the court that Rajiv Padyachi knew that she could not swim.</p>
      <p>Pratap says Padyachi had allegedly dragged her into the middle of the Colo-I-Suva pool and watched her struggle.</p>
      <p>She also says when she asked for help there was no expression on his face.</p>
      <p>Pratap also told the court that while she was struggling and shouting for help, Padyachi quickly came to hold her hair and gently put his hand over her mouth and pushed her into the water.</p>
      <p>Padyachi is charged with one count of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>30-year-old Padyachi had allegedly attempted to murder his former partner in September last year.</p>
      <p>A team of police officers heard Pratapâ€™s cry for help and managed to save her and arrested Padyachi.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
