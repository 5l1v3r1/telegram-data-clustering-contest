      <p>Former Fiji Airways Men's National 7s team Captain, Kalione Nasoko is starting to get back in shape as he aims to represent Fiji in next year's Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>Nasoko who got injured last season has been on a rehabilitation program to keep him in contention with other players.</p>
      <p>Fiji 7s coach, Gareth Baber had earlier said that Nasoko will be able to play sometimes in April next year.</p>
      <p>This means Nasoko will not feature in the first four tournaments of the 2019/2020 HSBC 7s Series and will need to step up his game if he wishes to be part of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>15 players are preparing for the upcoming 7s tournament next month including captain Paula Dranisinikula, Jerry Tuwai, Aminiasi Tuimaba, and Meli Derenalagi.</p>
      <p>Fiji is pooled with France, Argentina, and Japan in the Dubai 7s which begins on the 6th of next month.</p>
