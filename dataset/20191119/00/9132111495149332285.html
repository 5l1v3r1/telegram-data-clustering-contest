      <p>The New Patriotic Party (NPP) is strongly campaigning for a ‘Yes’ vote in the impending national referendum, adding that, it will end the ‘winner-takes-all’ canker that creates rancor in Ghana’s politics.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference in Accra on Monday, the General Secretary of the party, John Boadu, dismissed claims that the referendum will be to the advantage of the ruling New Patriotic Party.</p>
      <p>“There is no inherent advantage for any party but for the Ghanaian people and the quality of leadership and public services they get from their local government. That is why we begun on a platform of a consensus and it cannot be said that this entire Constitutional Reform exercise is to benefit one political party to the exclusion of others. Indeed, it is rather the current status quo which favours one political party or at best the two main political parties to the exclusion of all others,” he stated.</p>
      <p>He noted that if partisan advantage was the intention, President Akufo Addo and the NPP would not be leading the campaign to give up on his constitutional powers to nominate all Chief Executives of all Assemblies.</p>
      <p>The opposition party, National Democratic Congress (NDC) is pushing for a ‘NO’ vote, which the NPP describes as hypocritical, judging from the earlier stance, but Mr. Boadu said, the NPP will, however, appeal to the NDC to rescind its decision.</p>
      <p>“We will appeal to the NDC to put the national interest first. The NPP is fully behind the President’s programme and the people’s desire to democratize local governance and enhance accountability at that level. We are also happy to hear that Government intends to continue engaging the NDC and other stakeholders to get this important exercise of strengthening governance at the grassroots fully back on track,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added, “we also call on all patriotic citizens, including followers of NDC and other parties, to do what we all know to be right and support the “Yes” campaign.”</p>
