      <p>Investing.com – Stocks struggled to keep the big rally moving Tuesday, but weakness in retail stocks pulled the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30">Dow</a> lower and kept the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> in check.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> hit a new intraday high but just missed closing higher for a sixth straight day, but the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite">NASDAQ Composite</a> and <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nq-100">Nasdaq 100</a> indexes closed at record levels and hit new intraday highs. The <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30">Dow Jones industrial</a> fell back because of weak results and guidance from Home Depot (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/home-depot">HD</a>).</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> was off about two points, or 0.06%, with the Nasdaq up 0.24% and the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nq-100">Nasdaq 100</a> up 0.12%.</p>
      <p>Home Depot (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/home-depot">HD</a>) shares fell 5.4% and subtracted 88 points from the blue chips by itself. Discount department store chain Kohls (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/kohls-corp">KSS</a>) fell a whopping 19.5% after missing Street estimates for fiscal third-quarter earnings.</p>
      <p>The problems of the two stocks spread across retailing, generally causing declines in shares of Walmart (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/wal-mart-stores">WMT</a>), Macy’s (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/macys">M</a>) and Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/lowes-companies">LOW</a>), which reports quarterly results on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Commodity prices reacted to a threat by President Donald Trump to boost tariffs beyond levels scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15. <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/gold">Gold</a> moved higher, but <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">oil prices</a> moved lower.</p>
      <p>Stock investors seemed less alarmed by the Trump threat.</p>
      <p>Slack Technologies (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/slack-technologies-inc">WORK</a>) shares slumped after Microsoft (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/microsoft-corp">MSFT</a>) said some 20 million people now use its Teams messaging service, up 50%-plus since July. Microsoft was higher.</p>
