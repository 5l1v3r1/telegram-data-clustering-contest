        <b>Tottenham Hotspur announced on Tuesday evening that Mauricio Pochettino has been dismissed as Tottenham manager after more than five years in charge.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mauricio Pochettino is no longer Tottenham manager </b>after a terrible start to the Premier League season, the club have confirmed in a statement. </p>
      <p>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change and <b>it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly,</b> nor in haste. "Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season <b>have been extremely disappointing</b>," <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Spurs</a> chairman David Levy explained. </p>
      <p>Levy also confirmed Pochettino's assistants Jesus Perez, Miguel D'Agostino and Antoni Jimenez, have also left the club. Despite that, he recognised the success the team has had under the Argentine. “<b>Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history</b>. <b>I have the utmost admiration for the manner</b> in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us".</p>
      <p><b>The Spurs chairman concluded thanking Pochettino </b>and saying that he will always be welcome at the club.</p>

      <p>Pochettino joined the club in May 2014 and lead the team to fifth place in his first season<b> followed by four consecutive top four finishes</b> in the next four seasons. He even led them to second place in the 2016/17 campaign just seven points behind Chelsea. Last term, <b>Tottenham reached the Champions League final </b>where they lost to Liverpool. </p>
      <p><b>The news has gone viral on social media</b> and has been received with astonishment by many Tottenham fans.  In fact,<b> the Spurs website was unable to cope with the huge traffic</b> and the entire website was down temporarily. </p>
      <p>Gary Lineker reacted on Twitter to the decision by saying that Spurs will not find anyone better than Pochettino. Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by Spurs. "He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement....ain’t gonna happen, the ex-Spurs player and current presenter of BBC's Match of the Day said."</p>
