        <b>The Crown’s Tobias Menzies confessed he gets paid less than Olivia Colman and is happy about it considering <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/claire-foy/">Claire Foy</a> and Matt Smith’s pay gap scandal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tobias, 45, understood that Olivia is ‘much more established’ than him but found it ‘hard to swallow’ when he discovered lead star Claire Foy was earning quite a bit less than Matt Smith.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a29469500/the-crown-3-tobias-menzies-paid-less-olivia-colman/">Harper’s Bazaar UK</a>, the Game of Thrones star said: ‘It’s an area that, as you may appreciate, I’m wary to step into. I think broadly speaking, yes, greater transparency will lead to greater equality and that is absolutely the direction of travel that I think is necessary and good.</p>
      <p>‘It’s interesting… my understanding is, that this time round, I’m paid less than Olivia. Of course I think that feels proportionate because Olivia’s much more established than me and has a much higher profile that she’s bringing to the show and the product.’</p>

      <p>Tobias continued: ‘There are complexities within it that are sometimes hard to articulate. Someone’s not always coming in with the exact same amount of previous work, [but] the optics of that particular thing were hard to swallow because obviously Claire was doing the larger part. They got there in the end I suppose.’</p>
      <p>Claire, who plays a younger Queen Elizabeth II, earned £29,000 per hour-long episode while her more famous counterpart Matt allegedly earned an extra £10,000 or so more.</p>
      <p>However, Netflix apparently agreed to backpay Claire £200,000 after the scandal went viral, but the actress denies the report.</p>

      <p>Tobias replaced Matt as Prince Phillip opposite Oscar-winner Olivia as the new Queen, and producer Mackie stated that ‘going forward, no one gets paid more than the Queen.’</p>
      <p>The star also revealed that he was third-in-line for the role of Prince Philip in Season Three.</p>
      <p>Outlander star Tobias was left with some pretty big shoes to fill as he joined the franchise.</p>
      <p>Netflix bosses originally had their eye on both <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/crown-bosses-wanted-paul-bettany-mark-strong-play-prince-philip-tobias-menzies-11176999/">Kingsman’s Mark Strong and Avengers Endgame star Paul Bettany for the role.</a></p>
      <p>‘Initially, I think they went after Mark Strong, then Paul Bettany, and then it came back around to me,’ Tobias told <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=55199X1529169&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2F2019%2F11%2F18%2Fcrown-bosses-wanted-paul-bettany-mark-strong-play-prince-philip-tobias-menzies-11176999%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Farticle%2Ftobias-menzies-interview-the-crown-season-three-prince-phillip-n8n2kqcpd&amp;xguid=01DQT6979W3GS366S55NVCSB97&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=0&amp;xuuid=c00596659039de6ff463a613de9bb093">The Sunday Times Magazine</a>.</p>
