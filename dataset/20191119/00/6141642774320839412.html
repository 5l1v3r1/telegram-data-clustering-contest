      <p>Older people with diabetes and memory problems would benefit from using wearable glucose monitors, a study suggests.</p>
      <p>The devices help people with diabetes manage their condition by reducing the need for finger-prick blood tests.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the University of East Anglia trialled the monitors with 12 participants who had an average age of 85 and were experiencing memory problems or had a diagnosis of dementia.</p>
      <p>The devices captured data across 14 days.</p>
      <p>The research team interviewed the participants and carers afterwards to see how they got on with using the devices, and they said most spoke favourably about them.</p>

      <p>“Older methods of checking blood sugars rely on people doing finger-prick tests.</p>
      <p>“The newest technology works by allowing a sensor inserted under the skin on the arm to pick up sugar readings all the time for up to two weeks without having to do finger-prick tests.</p>
      <p>“The sensor reads sugar levels and transmits them wirelessly to a display on a portable reader held near the sensor – a bit like swiping a contactless bank card.”</p>
      <p>The Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system, used by former prime minister Theresa May, was made available on the NHS in 2017.</p>
      <p>While they have been approved, mainly for younger adults, they are not universally available.</p>
      <p>“It is estimated that up to 20% of older people with dementia also have coexisting diabetes,” said Dr Mattishent.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big problem because they may be more prone to low blood sugars (hypoglycaemia) from their medication, but not recognising the warning signs – or what to do if it happens.</p>
      <p>“This is the first project to see if new wearable glucose monitoring technology could be useful for older people with diabetes and memory problems.”</p>
      <p>Prof Yoon Loke, also from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, said: “Our study found that older people and their carers overwhelmingly found the device to be acceptable to use and reassuring to be able to check sugar levels more easily.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t interfere with their day-to-day activities and they were not aware of the device while sleeping at night.</p>
      <p>“Carers spoke favourably about the simplicity of the device.</p>
      <p>“And all of the participants were positive about recommending it to others.</p>
      <p>“One of the carers said that it is very stressful to have to regularly stab her husband’s fingers to get blood samples.</p>
      <p>“He had dementia and diabetes, and couldn’t understand why anyone needed to hurt him with a needle.</p>
      <p>“So you can see how something as simple as using this device could really benefit this vulnerable group and their carers.”</p>
      <blockquote>Devices which continuously monitor people with dementia could help keep them out of hospital, preventing unnecessary distress, and saving the NHS money<cite>Professor Yoon Loke, UEA Norwich Medical School</cite></blockquote>
      <p>One problem was that data recorded was not always complete because it relied on participants or their carers “swiping” three scans a day,” Prof Loke said.</p>
      <p>“Real-time devices that automatically record and send the data through Bluetooth may therefore be even more beneficial for people with memory problems,” he added.</p>
      <p>Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Devices which continuously monitor people with dementia could help keep them out of hospital, preventing unnecessary distress, and saving the NHS money.”</p>
