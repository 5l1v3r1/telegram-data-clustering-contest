      <h1>Bayelsa: Dickson Reveals Next Move, Says Jonathan Remains His ‘Oga’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>Governor Seriake Dickson has said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will approach the Election Petition Tribunal to challenged the result of the Bayelsa Governorship election.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the National Electoral Commission (INEC), had declared <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>David Lyon the winner of the Bayelsa Governorship Election</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Lyon was declared the winner of the Bayelsa election by INEC Returning Officer and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin, Professor Faraday Orunmuwese, on Monday morning, November 18.</p>
      <p>Professor Orunmuwese returned the APC candidate as the winner of the keenly contested Bayelsa election after scoring the highest number of votes in the poll.</p>
      <p>Lyon scored a total of 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party, Duoye Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>Speaking to newsmen on Tuesday, Governor Dickson said the Bayelsa Guber election was characterised by violence and widespread malpractices which were carefully documented.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“Our candidate, Senator Douye Diri and the party chairman have been speaking about the charade called an election that took place in Bayelsa on Saturday, and the invasion of our state by security forces.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The dehumanisation of our people and how in the majority of areas and places, our people were denied the right to vote for the candidate of their choice.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The story is all out there that what took place in the state on November 16 was not a democratic election.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“So, today, I’m here to add my voice to all that has been said already. It was so brazen, it has never been like this in this state before.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Dickson condemned the endorsement of David Lyon by former President Goodluck Jonathan.</p>
      <p>He also denied sidelining Jonathan and chieftains of the PDP in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p><i>“Jonathan remains my oga (boss) and I respect him, but there are lots of efforts by certain interest to create a rift between us, there is no politician that has been there for the former president than me,”</i> Dickson said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“He has also helped me but it is unfortunate that I am being misconstrued in this matter of the election. I tried to meet Jonathan 16 times and he opted to support a candidate that does not wish me well.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I will soon write my memoirs and people will have a fair view of what happened, the visit of some APC governors to Jonathan who congratulated the APC candidate without congratulating the candidate of his party.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is strategic for APC leaders to use Jonathan to legitimise the illegitimacy that happened on Saturday.”</i>
