      <h1>Bypolls heat up on the last day of nominations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p>Rallies, defections, charges and counter charges marked the last day of filing nominations for by-elections of the 15 Assembly seats. All 13 disqualified Congress and JD(S) MLAs, who were given the BJP tickets, filed their papers. <br/><br/>JD(S) managed to get defeated BJP candidate in 2018 Assembly polls, Ashok Poojari, to contest from Gokak, against BJP’s Ramesh Jarkiholi. The party also tried to woo a local Lingayat Mutt head Shivalinga Shivacharya, of Kabbina Kanti Mutt in Hirekerur, to contest against BJP candidate BC Patil. <br/><br/>Efforts are being made by Shivamogga MP and CM Yediyurappa’s son BY Raghavendra to make the religious head to withdraw to avoid split in Lingayat votes. <br/><br/>Leaders who accompanied candidates traded charges against each other. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy said that he lost power due to the conspiracy by a section of Congress, while Hoskote BJP candidate MTB Nagaraj challenged the Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah to an open debate on whether he took a cheque from him. Nagaraj alleged that he had given a huge amount of money through bank cheques during the Assembly polls in 2018 to help Siddaramaiah win in Badami. <br/><br/>It’s a clash between brothers in Belagavi. Disqualified MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi (BJP) is contesting against his younger brother Lakkan Jarkiholi (Congress). Former ministers Satish Jarkiholi and Balachandra Jarkiholi are backing Lakkan and Ramesh respectively.</p>

      <p>Other prominent candidates who filed their nominations on the last day include AH Vishananath (Hunsur), Rizwan Arshad (Shivajinagar), Anand Singh and Venkatrao Ghorpade (Vijayanagar), Raju Kage and Shrimant Patil (Kagwada), Mahesh Kumtalli (Athani), KC Narayana Gowda (KR Pete), K Gopalaiah (Mahalakshmi Layout), ST Somashekhar and Javarayi Gowda (Yeshwantpur), BC Patil (Hirekerur), Shivaram Hebbar (Yellapur). <br/><br/><br/>In Chikkaballapur, both KP Bacheche Gowda and Radhakrishna have filed papers as JD(S) candidates. Gowda is likely to withdraw from the fray as he is not too keen to contest. BJP candidate K Sudhakar and Congress’ M Anjanappa too filed their papers in Chikkaballapur. <br/><br/>In Hoskote, the CM accompanied Nagaraj, who filed a second set of papers. The CM asked people to elect Nagaraj as he is slated to become a minister within 24 hours after getting elected.</p>
