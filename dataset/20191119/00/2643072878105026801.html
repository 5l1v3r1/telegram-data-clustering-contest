      <p>Troops of the Nigeria Army have attacked <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/just-in-troops-clash-with-boko-haram-in-borno/"><u><b>Boko Haram</b></u></a> insurgents in an ambush at Ala Village, 7 km away from New Marte in Borno State, Northeast Nigeria.</p>
      <p>This was made known in a statement on Tuesday by Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, the Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator.</p>
      <p>Colonel Iliyasu disclosed that the Army recovered arms and ammunition including 2 Gun Trucks, 2 Anti-Aircraft Guns, 2,080 Rounds of 7.62mm NATO ammunition amongst others.</p>
      <p>The statement reads: <i>“In yet another incident of tactical boomerang in the face of superior tactics and training, in the early hours of 18th November 2019, troops ambushed some remnants of the criminal Boko Haram insurgents along the patrol route at Ala Village, 7 km away from New Marte.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>” The ambush was reinforced with a crudely prepared Improvised Explosive Device planted by them against the troops</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“In a rare display of boldness, resilience and faithful service to their fatherland, the troops, rather than getting discouraged by this sudden attack on them, turned around the initial setback and dealt a devastating blow on their criminal attackers.</i>
      </p>
      <p>“<i>Having so clearly asserted their superiority in the ensuing firefight, the criminal insurgents were forced to flee in disarray.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The gallant troops then embarked on a relentless pursuit of the scampering insurgents who abandoned some of their fighting equipment in utter confusion,” he said</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“At the end of the pursuit and exploitation, 2 Gun Trucks, 2 Anti-Aircraft Guns, 2,080 Rounds of 7.62mm NATO ammunition, 26 Rounds of 12.7 mm Armour Piercing Incendiary ammunition, 3 AK 47 Rifles, 6 Rounds of 12.7 mm (Belted), one AOJOE motorcycle, some clothes, foodstuffs and mechanical tools belonging to the criminals were captured by the troops.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>” Most of the Boko Haram criminal elements were believed to have escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds. However, troops continue to dominate the area with patrols to deny the criminal insurgents freedom of action.”</i>
