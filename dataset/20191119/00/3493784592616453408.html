      <h1>Spotlight on Stefanik catapults quiet 2020 race onto national stage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:12:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:12</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Gronewold, Nick Niedzwiadek</a></address>
      <p>ALBANY —<b> </b>It was a made-for-social-media moment that cemented Rep. <a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/227481">Elise Stefanik</a> (R-N.Y.) as the breakout dynamo of the nascent impeachment hearings: An accusation that House Intelligence Chairman<b> </b><a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51608">Adam Schiff</a> was <a href="https://twitter.com/EliseStefanik/status/1195396189824409600?s=20"><u>abusing his power</u></a> to silence Republicans.</p>
      <p>Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. recently began following Stefanik on Twitter, and the president himself declared that “a new Republican Star is born.”</p>
      <p>But the moment on Friday also attracted the laser focus of Democrats and high-profile supporters to Stefanik’s historically Republican congressional district in upstate New York. George Conway, the disillusioned Republican lawyer and husband of top White House aide Kellyanne Conway, gave the maximum individual donation to Tedra Cobb, the Democratic frontrunner challenging Stefanik. And celebrities like Zach Braff, Mark Hamill and model-activist-chef Chrissy Teigen encouraged their millions of social media followers to support Cobb’s campaign.</p>
      <p>Cobb announced Sunday on Twitter that she raised $1 million in a three-day stretch following the skirmish, after which she took a snow blower to her driveway in the frigid North Country. She brought in just over $1.5 million total in her unsuccessful 2018 campaign.</p>
      <p>Democrats see opportunity in Stefanik's rapid shift to the right as she’s shifted into the spotlight. She's deployed rhetoric more closely associated with conservative hardliners than the buttoned-up moderates with<b> </b>whom she<b> </b>had been cast.</p>
      <p>“All that national stuff is coming home to roost in the 21st because Elise Stefanik has taken on such a central role in those hearings,” said Jack McGuire, a politics professor at SUNY Potsdam in the district. “She’s helped herself in the establishment, maybe, but there’s a double edged sword in that, and I think she’s realized that now, because Tedra Cobb has gotten a million bucks.”</p>
      <p>Making a play for the seat would be a stretch for Democrats, as Republicans have a registration advantage of more than 46,000 active voters, or an 11 percentage point advantage. But $1 million goes far in a limited media market that will now shift focus from local constituent concerns to the national debate, said SUNY Plattsburgh political science professor Harvey Schantz, who has been studying the district’s political history for decades.</p>
      <p>“You’d always expect the incumbent to be elected, but when national events stir up uncertainty, well, a challenger needs an uncertain environment,” Schantz said. “To some degree the incumbent loses control of the information environment, then, potentially, something could happen.”</p>
      <p>Though it went for former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Trump won the district — which stretches from the racetracks and mineral springs of Saratoga Springs up to the Canadian border — by 14 points in 2016. Stefanik defeated Cobb by a similar margin in the 2018 midterms.</p>
      <p>It could be considered competitive, but hasn’t nearly kept pace with other Upstate districts that have shifted left in recent years like the nearby 22nd Congressional District, which flipped for Rep. <a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/196347">Anthony Brindisi</a> (D-N.Y.) in 2018.</p>
      <p>New York’s 21st Congressional District is rural in a Middle America sense, which is rare in the Northeast. It includes vast expanses of sparsely populated North Country land, the majority of the Adirondack Mountains, and its residents face the struggles of an aging, declining population.</p>
      <p>It also includes the Fort Drum military base and nearly 64,000 veterans, the most of any of the state’s congressional districts. “Repeal the S.A.F.E. Act” signs remain a common sight planted on mountain properties along its highways, protesting strict gun control laws New York passed more than six years ago.</p>
      <p>A three-term congresswoman, Stefanik, 35, has been long been touted as a rising star for Republicans, even before she became the youngest woman elected to Congress when she first won office in 2014 at age 30. She was a White House staffer for former President George W. Bush, had close ties to former House Speaker Paul Ryan — including helping him prepare for the 2012 vice presidential debate against Joe Biden — and positioned herself as a moderate who occasionally bucked party leadership, including Trump.</p>
      <p>She voted against the 2017 tax cuts over the cap on state-and-local tax deductions and rebuked the Trump administration’s decision to pull troops from Syria as <a href="https://stefanik.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stefanik-releases-joint-statement-regarding-syria-bipartisan-colleagues"><u>“a misguided and catastrophic blow</u></a> to our national security interests.”</p>
      <p>She’s home often, but doesn’t always bring the concerns of Washington with her, said SUNY Potsdam’s McGuire, preferring to cater to her specific Upstate issues. She doesn't go out of her way to earn media attention and has been criticized for <a href="https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/37057/20180920/in-age-of-social-media-stefanik-keeps-north-country-press-at-arm-s-length">dodging local reporters</a> in their attempts to cover her.</p>
      <p>When she’s bucked party lines, it’s when she says her district is at risk, like standing with 222 Democrats to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank that she said will bring jobs to the North Country. When she stands boldly with Trump, it’s for clear district wins like the <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/08/13/trump-signs-defense-bill-at-fort-drum-556220"><u>Fort Drum signing</u></a> of the defense bill in 2018.</p>
      <p>Stefanik’s Friday powerplay has been an unexpected development for congressional<b> </b>Republicans, who subbed in Rep. <a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51745">Jim Jordan</a> (Ohio) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/08/jim-jordan-intelligence-committee-068049"><u>ahead of the televised hearings</u></a> for fear of not having strong enough attack dogs on the House Intelligence Committee. Coming from Stefanik — the GOP’s sole female member on the committee — has been an additional bonus given the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/kavanaugh-hearing-senate-republicans-828601"><u>optics problems</u></a> that all-male panels presented in past high-profile hearings.</p>
      <p>Neither Stefanik's nor Cobb's campaigns responded to requests for comment or interviews. Stefanik’s campaign did not respond to a request for fundraising numbers from the weekend.</p>
      <p>The political pirouette also comes at a much-needed moment for New York’s Republican Party. Its congressional ranks have dwindled after the dean of the GOP delegation Rep. <a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51465">Pete King</a> announced his retirement and Rep. Chris Collins resigned after being convicted on securities fraud charges.</p>
      <p>Although Stefanik’s team did not disclose her fundraising since the Friday incident, her campaign Twitter account has used the kerfluffle to solicit donations at least seven times since. Other solicitations on her behalf have come from New York GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy and former Rep. John Faso<b> </b>(R-N.Y.), who was ousted last November after one term.</p>
      <p>The GOP has not won a statewide contest in New York since 2002, and one of its most notable former office holders — Mike Bloomberg — is on the verge of jumping into the presidential contest as a Democrat. (He left the Republican Party in 2007.)</p>
      <p>Stefanik’s recent aggressiveness was somewhat previewed in her 2018 campaign, adopting Trump’s penchant for nicknaming rivals with the alliterative “Taxin’ Tedra” and accusing a local newspaper of censorship earlier this year for its policy of not running quotes from politicians’ spokespeople.</p>
      <p>The demeanor shift is prime campaign meat for Cobb, a former St. Lawrence County legislator, who has reportedly been beefing up the second volume of her challenge with campaign veterans.</p>
      <p>“She hasn’t made any silly gaffes, and she’s been and letting Elise Stefanik make unforced errors,” McGuire said of Cobb. “Which hasn’t happened until now, when Stefanik has sort of done the full monty and exposed herself.”</p>
      <p>But more party devotion isn’t a concern for the state Republican Party.</p>
      <p>“Her opponent is an extreme lefty that ran last time, and Elise disposed of her easily,” Langworthy told POLITICO in an interview. “You have the Hollywood glitterati coming in trying to trash Elise for standing up and calling this for what it is.”</p>
      <p>“She’s always been a trailblazer,” he added, and “we’re now just seeing it on a bigger stage.”</p>
