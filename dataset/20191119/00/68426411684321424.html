      <p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year. And if you know someone who like cars, it’s even better. It makes ticking off your gift list easier, as there is a plethora of choices for those who love driving, and even more for those who just want to get through their daily commute.</p>
      <p>Here’s a wish list of items ranging from practical to whimsical, all guaranteed to spin the wheels of your car-loving friends or family. Maybe there’s even a treat on the list for you, too.</p>

      <h4>An illuminating nod to the past</h4>
      <p>If you’ve got someone on your list who’s into classic Detroit iron, their eyes will surely light up when they see this desk accessory. <a href="https://www.carfurniture.com/collections/lamps-lighting">Carfurniture.com</a> is offering lamps made from real valve covers off old Ford, General Motors, Chrysler and even International V8s, with bases made from a harmonic balancer. The lamps are covered in clear coat to preserve the authentic patina, making them look as if they were just pulled from a junk yard. Prices start at US$599.</p>
      <h4>Wrap up in winter warmth</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Nothing feels better than heated seats on a cold winter drive. But if you don’t have those in your current vehicle, you can get the next best thing with a 12-volt heated car blanket. Just plug it in to your 12V socket (that’s the cigarette lighter in your really old car) and feel its warmth envelop you. Blankets are available from various sources; this plaid version is from <a href="https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/heated-12v-blanket-0321498p.html">Canadian Tire</a> and sells for $64.99.</p>
      <h4>Put your foot in it</h4>

      <p>To some, these might just look like fancy socks.

Separately, they run just US$15 a pair, or you can get gift packs of three pairs or more.</p>
      <h4>Get your head around a dash cam</h4>

Priced in the US$40 range, depending on the style, these ties are a stylish way to tell those around the boardroom table that you’d rather be driving.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>If you can’t buy a new Porsche 911, you can still give someone a piece of one.

Not only can you connect your phone or tablet through Bluetooth, but it can also connect with other Porsche speakers for even greater volume. The battery lasts up to 24 hours – the same amount of time it takes to complete the Le Mans endurance race. Coincidence? Find it at <a href="https://www.porsche-design.ca/Electronics/Sound/Speaker/911-Speaker-black.html">porschedesign.ca</a> for $799.</p>
