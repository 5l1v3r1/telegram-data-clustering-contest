      <p>PRNigeria has revealed a disturbing alleging the son of the Shehu of Borno, Kashim Abubakar- Elkanemi, recklessly knocked down an officer of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) during a car racing in Maiduguri, Borno State.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> learnt that the incident occurred on November 16, about 5:30 pm at the Ramat Square Maiduguri, when some children of Borno prominent personalities known as Yarwa squad pulled a street racing stunt with dozens of expensive cars.</p>
      <p>The wounded officer, Mr Usman Bakari, is the NSCDC Divisional Officer in charge of the Maiduguri metropolitan council.</p>
      <p>According to an eyewitness (name withheld) who confirmed the development to PRNigeria on Monday, the officer was crushed by the Shehu’s son after asking them to stop the race in order to prevent an accident.</p>
      <p>The witness said further that some of the youths were saying who are you (NSCDC officer) to stop the Son of the Shehu from doing whatever he wants to do. This is his father’s land and while the argument was going on, two vehicles sped towards the officer in an attempt to hit him, but the officer narrowly escaped but the Shehu’s son made another turn with the vehicle and in top speed, he knocked down the security officer while other personnel narrowly escaped the attack.</p>
      <p>It was revealed that the officer was hit by a sky-blue Peugeot 406 which flew him in the air before landing on the ground, just as the vehicle fled the scene immediately afterwards.</p>
      <p>The officer was left in his own pool of blood with injuries and was taken to the Maiduguri Specialist Hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>The NSCDC Borno command has arrested a suspect associated with the incident while the son of Elkanemi escaped.</p>
