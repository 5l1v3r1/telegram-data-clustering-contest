        <b>A successful season on the field for Manchester City in 2018-19 ran along a record campaign in financial terms for the club.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> <b>posted record revenues of £535.2million in 2018-19</b>, according the Premier League champions' latest annual report.</p>
      <p><b>Pep Guardiola's side won an unprecedented domestic treble</b> in English football last season, alongside the Community Shield, <b>while City's women's team collected the League Cup and FA Cup</b>. Revenue scaling £500m for a second consecutive year helped City to return a profit of £10.1m – a fifth consecutive year in the black for the club.</p>
      <p><b>"This level of sustained success is possible for many reasons</b>, but in particular because of our people and, critically, because of our ability to plan," said City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak. As intended by His Highness Sheikh Mansour, <b>our organisation is now at a level of maturity</b> that enables us to plan on multi-year cycles both in terms of our management of squads and more widely across the business.</p>

      <p><b>"This strategic planning has allowed us to create an environment</b> in which continued on-pitch success is both possible and likely, and financial sustainability is a reality. 2018-19 saw an 11th consecutive year of revenue growth, and that is in part a product of our ongoing investment in football expertise, not just in Manchester but around the world. <b>That investment will remain fundamental to our approach</b>."</p>

      <p><b>The spike in revenue was almost entirely accounted for by broadcast revenue</b> paid out under the first season of UEFA's latest three-year rights agreement for the Champions League – with an incoming sum of £85.7m compared to £54.6m for the previous 12 months. This season, City began a lucrative 10-year kit manufacturing deal with Puma, which is reported to be worth in the region of £65m per season. <b>The financial impact of this agreement will be shown from next year's results</b>.</p>
      <p>City's wages were up £55.6m to £315.3m, <b>with their wage/revenue ratio rising to "a healthy" 59 per cent</b> from 52 per cent. A close-season transfer window that saw the arrival of club-record signing Rodri, Joao Cancelo and Angelino, while the likes of Fabian Delph, Danilo and Douglas Luiz moved on, <b>amounted to a net spend of approximately £109m</b>.</p>

      <p>City have been the subject of a number of investigations since revelations alleging financial impropriety were published by Der Spiegel last year, <b>drawing upon documents purportedly obtained by the whistleblower Football Leaks</b>. FIFA issued a fine for breaches of rules related to the recruitment of youth players, <b>although City avoided a transfer ban</b>, and the Football Association also found no evidence of an illegal payment to the agent of their former winger Jadon Sancho.</p>
      <p>Investigations from the Premier League and UEFA remain ongoing, although The Athletic reported last week that City will not be hit with a Champions League ban by European football's governing body following claims they failed to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations. In addressing the UEFA investigation in the annual report, City said: <b>"The directors welcomed the opening of a formal UEFA investigation</b> as an opportunity to bring to an end the speculation resulting from the illegal hacking and out of context publication of club emails.</p>
      <p><b>"The directors are entirely confident of a positive outcome</b> when the matter is considered by an independent judicial body."</p>
