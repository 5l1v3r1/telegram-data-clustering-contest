      <h1>General election: How Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson shape up ahead of TV clash</h1>
      <h2>The two leaders have been frantically prepping for their first head-to-head debate of the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn is hoping to expose Boris Johnson's "blustering" while the PM wants to keep his head start in the polls</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:40:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:40</time> by <a rel="author">Pippa Crerar, Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/pippa-crerar/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn will use tonight’s historic head-to-head TV clash to expose “blustering” <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> as untrustworthy and offering no hope for the UK, senior <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> figures believe. </p>
      <p>The prime-time ITV slot, expected to be watched by millions of voters, will be a key moment for the Labour leader to try to reassure voters that his policies would make the country a better place.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn is currently lagging behind in the polls and the hour-long debate, hosted by Julie Etchingham, will give him the chance to project his vision straight into the nation’s sitting-rooms. </p>
      <p>The Labour leader’s team believe that this week, including the launch of the Labour manifesto on Thursday, could be a decisive moment when public opinion starts to shift in their favour. </p>
      <p>Shadow minister Jack Dromey told the Mirror: “The debate is an opportunity for Jeremy to expose blustering Boris for what he is - a man who cannot be trusted, offering no hope for the country.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“Jeremy needs, with typical sincerity, to show that Labour will offer radical and much-needed change. This could be a pivotal moment which turns the tide in Labour’s direction.”</p>
      <p>At this stage in 2017 Labour was further behind in the polls, but by election day had closed the gap significantly, enough to deprive <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> - who refused to appear in debates and whose manifesto fell flat - of her majority. </p>
      <p>It will be the first time a sitting PM has agreed to a one-on-one debate with the leader of the Opposition, and Mr Johnson‘s advisers acknowledge that it is a major risk. </p>
      <p>The pair have only clashed at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pmqs">PMQs</a> three time, even though Mr Johnson has been in power since July. </p>
      <p>The first half of tonight’s debate will focus on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> and the Tory leader is expected to attack Labour’s plan to give the people a final say - insisting only he can get deliver Brexit. </p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn will be on comfortable territory for the second half - during which they will be quizzed on domestic policy - and will focus on the devastation caused by almost a decade of Tory austerity and whether Mr Johnson can be trusted. </p>
      <p>Both men have been prepping for the debate with their top teams for days.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson is being coached for the live showdown by Brett O’Donnell, an American Republican guru he worked with during the Brexit referendum and advised him to repeatedly deliver his “take back control” mantra.</p>
      <p>Cabinet minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-gove">Michael Gove</a> has reprised his role as the Tory leader’s opponent by acting as Mr Corbyn during rehearsals. </p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, however, has rejected outside help and has stuck with the same team of advisors who prepare him for PMQs every week. </p>
      <p>A young Labour press aide who insiders say does “a mean impression of Boris” has again being playing the role of the PM. </p>
      <p>It comes after the Lib Dems and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> lost a High Court challenge against ITV over its decision to exclude their party leaders Jo Swinson or Nicola Sturgeon from the debate.</p>
      <p>All four party leaders will appear in a Question Time Special in Sheffield this Friday. </p>

      <h3>Who will be in the ITV general election debate and why is it controversial?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> will go head-to-head in the first televised debate.</p>
      <p>It is the first time the leaders of the two main parties have squared off since 2015 - and it is set to be dramatic.</p>
      <p>The debate will be hosted by Julie Etchingham - and campaign bosses will hope that a good performance will give their candidate an edge as the election hits its stride.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17793073.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BRITAIN-POLITICS-EU-BREXIT.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> and the Scottish National Party lost their case against ITV in the High Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>The court ruled the parties had not been unfairly excluded.</p>
      <p>ITV say they will propose another format later in the campaign which will give the other parties a chance to be heard.</p>
      <h3>Who will be in the Sky News general election debate?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4986279.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Sky-News-presenter-Adam-Boulton.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It is not clear whether or not the Sky debate will go ahead.</p>
      <p>So far just Jo Swinson has confirmed and it's unclear when it would happen.</p>
      <p>Sky has invited Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn to take part in the debate - but neither has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Details are sparse so far.</p>
      <h3>Who will take part in the BBC debates and how many are they hosting?</h3>
      <p>Perhaps not surprisingly the BBC has the most events as part of this election.</p>
      <p>The first debate will be a seven-way podium debate at 7pm on Friday, November 29 in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Plaid Cymru. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> , the Lib Dems, Greens, Conservative, SNP and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party have all been invited.</p>
      <p>The second debate will be a head-to-head clash beterrn Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn just six days before Britain goes to the polls.</p>
      <p>They will likely have scores to settle after their first battle on ITV.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster will then air another head-to-head clash, this time on on Friday, December 6 from Southampton - six days before the election date.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is where it gets a bit complicated - because they are are also holding a number of Question Time-style specials.</p>
      <p>A special two-hour long "Leaders' Special" will take place on November 22 from Cardiff.</p>
      <p>It will give an audience the chance to quiz the main party leaders.</p>
      <p>It will be followed by two more specials with the leader of the Brexit Party and the co-leaders of the Green Party.</p>
      <p>A Question Time special aimed at voters under 30 will be aired on Monday, December 9.</p>
      <p>And the BBC will also host debates in the devolved nations and regions.</p>
      <p>BBC Wales will be holding two live debates on Tuesday Nov 26 and Tuesday Dec 3.</p>
      <p>BBC Scotland is set to broadcast its Scotland Leaders debate live from Glasgow on Tuesday Dec 10.</p>
      <p>Later that same night BBC Northern Ireland will host a debate of party leaders there.</p>
