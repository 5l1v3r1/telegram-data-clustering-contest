        <b>The 'Mirror' are stating that Benítez, who is currently in charge of Dalian Yifang in China, could succeed Manuel Pellegrini at West Ham.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>West Ham</b>'s bad run of form has led the board to consider a replacement. Manuel Pellegrini has lot support and that's why the Hammers have possible replacements in mind.</p>
      <p>According to the 'Mirror', the <b>London outfit would look favourably on Rafa Benítez</b>. The Premier League legend, who managed Liverpool and Newcastle, is currently managing in China after ending his spell with the Magpies.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard currently <b>earns around 15 million euros a year</b> with Dalian Yifang, but he would accept a pay cut to move to the Premier League.</p>
