      <h3>Results: 19 November</h3>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080761/#match-timeline">Nepal 0-1 Kuwait</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A hard-fought but vital win the visitors, who move to within two points of Australia - the Socceroos having a game in hand - at the top of Group B. Bader Al Mutawa's solitary first-half strike made him the Kuwaiti hero, while their defence - which has now kept three consecutive clean sheets in World Cup qualifying - was again rock-solid.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080709/#match-timeline">Myanmar 1-0 Mongolia</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hlaing Bo Bo scored the only goal as Myanmar climb off the foot of Group F by registering back-to-back World Cup qualifying wins for the first time in their history. Opponents Mongolia now occupy bottom spot.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080621/#match-timeline">Maldives 3-1 Guam</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Guam remain winless at the foot of Group A after being edged out by their hosts, who stay second-from-bottom of the section despite climbing on to six points.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080669/#match-timeline">Turkmenistan 2-0 Sri Lanka</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Group H has an unlikely new leader after Turkmenistan beat Sri Lanka and moved on to nine points, leapfrogging Korea Republic (eight points), Lebanon (seven) and Korea DPR (seven). All three of their rivals retain a game in hand but that will not dampen enthusiasm in Ashgabat tonight.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080737/#match-timeline">Hong Kong 2-0 Cambodia</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Goals from Ha James and Roberto Junior handed Hong Kong their first win in this round of qualifying, leaving Cambodia rooted to the foot of the table with just a single point from five matches.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080748/#match-timeline">Uzbekistan 2-0 Palestine</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Towering striker Eldor Shomurodov (pictured above) bagged a brace as Uzbekistan climbed to the top of Group D. Shomurodov's goals - his sixth in his last four World Cup qualifying appearances - saw the victors leapfrog Saudi Arabia, who retain a game in hand.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080657/#match-timeline">Malaysia 2-0 Indonesia</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Safawi Rasid's brace - the diminutive forward bagging either side of the break - saw the Malaysians to a precious three points in front of a fervent 80,000 capacity crowd at the Bukit Jalil Stadium.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080656/#match-timeline">Vietnam 0-0 Thailand</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A tight game in Hanoi saw Vietnam extend their unbeaten start to Group G, maintaining their place at the summit of the pool. With the top three sides separated by three points, the final fixtures in 2020 look set to serve up an enthralling finale.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080697/#match-timeline">Afghanistan 0-1 Qatar</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A second-half penalty from star forward Akrim Afif saw the 2022 hosts to another Group E victory. Their unbeaten start to the qualifiers continues with a third consecutive victory. They remain top of the group, ahead of local rivals Oman.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080736/#match-timeline">Iraq 0-0 Bahrain</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A tight and nervy game in Amman, Jordan saw the Group C spoils shared between the top two teams in the pool. Both remain unbeaten going into the final fixtures in 2020, with both standing a good chance of progressing to the final round.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080708/#match-timeline">Kyrgyz Republic 1-1 Tajikistan</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A late equaliser from defender Tamirlan Kozubaev earned a point for the hosts in Bishkek. The visitors had taken an early lead through forward Jahongir Ergashev's 17th-minute strike, and they looked set to hold on to a victory that would have seen them leapfrog their opponents - but the late leveller meant they share seven points apiece in Group F, behind group leaders Japan.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080620/#match-timeline">Syria 1-0 Philippines</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Syria's remarkable start to the 2022 World Cup qualifiers continues with their fifth straight victory. They looked in control in the opening half, even if they only took a slender lead into the break courtesy of Ward Al Salama's 23rd-minute effort. After the interval, they failed to push on - and their opponents almost punished them - but the form team in Asia's qualifying stages held firm to secure another valuable three points.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080696/#match-timeline">Oman 1-0 India</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The hosts cemented their place behind Group E leaders Qatar with a solid, if unspectacular, victory against India. Mohsin Al Ghassani's first-half effort was enough to secure all three points for Erwin Koeman's side, as they stretched their lead over Afghanistan in third place to eight points, with three games remaining.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080749/#match-timeline">Yemen 1-2 Singapore</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A huge win for Singapore in Al Muharraq came courtesy of goals either side of half-time. Ikhsan Fandi scored before the break today - adding to his goal against the same opponents in September - and Hafiz Nor also bagged after the interval. A late strike from Nasser Al Gahwashi was not enough for the Red Devils, who see today's opponents leapfrog them into third place.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080760/#match-timeline">Jordan 5-0 Chinese Taipei</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The hosts cruised to victory in Amman to pick up an important three points in the battle to keep apace with Australia at the Group B summit. Bahaa Faisal's brace was complemented by strikes from Ahmad Ersan, Yazn Abou Al Arab and Hamza Al-Dardour. Vital Borkelmans' side remain two points behind group leaders Australia in third place (even if the Socceroos have a game in hand), with Kuwait in second spot on goal difference.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/asia/matches/match/400080668/#match-timeline">Lebanon 0-0 Korea DPR</a>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A point apiece in Beirut suited neither side, with both still level on points with each other, but now also level with Korea Republic on eight (who have a game in hand) and a point behind surprise group leaders Turkmenistan.</li>
      </ul>
