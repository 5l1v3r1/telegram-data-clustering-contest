      <p>Helena Bonham Carter has said digging into her family history for a Channel 4 show convinced her that researching your grandparents should be part of the national curriculum.</p>
      <p>Bonham Carter, 53, who is starring as Princess Margaret in The Crown, is one of four actors and actresses exploring their grandparents’ wartime stories in a series for Channel 4.</p>
      <p>Sir Mark Rylance, Kristin Scott Thomas and Carey Mulligan also appear in their own episodes of My Grandparents’ War.</p>

      <p>Bonham Carter said she had become “evangelical” about digging into her past since appearing on the show, which commemorates the 80th anniversary of the start of the Second World War.</p>
      <p>Her maternal grandfather Eduardo Propper de Callejon was a Spanish diplomat who defied his government’s orders and helped Jews escape the Holocaust during the Nazi invasion of France.</p>
      <p>She also learned that her English paternal grandmother Lady Violet Bonham Carter, a mother of four and liberal politician, also fought anti-Semitism as a volunteer air raid warden.</p>
      <p>Bonham Carter said: “It’s a great family. And I’m proud now to be able to share it.</p>
      <p>“Part of me feels like this was just the beginning because this whole thing was a gift for me… we were given a chance to go and explore and ask the questions and hear what really happened, and then have extraordinary surprises – the level of research, and the people that did the research, they were extraordinary in what they managed to dig up.</p>

      <p>“For me, my family is extraordinary, and I was born too late and they died too soon, so for me it was like I met them properly, and had a conversation with them, and I also want to carry on conversing with my mum. The conversations that I’ve started, I feel like there’s a lot more, and one thing that I have gone around, because I’m almost evangelical, is saying that it’s one of the most important things I’ve done.</p>
      <p>“I feel like every young person should go and interview their grandparents.”</p>
      <p>The programme also sees Bonham Carter interview her grandmother, called Bubbles, at length.</p>
      <p>She said: “I did, years ago, interview my mother’s mother for hours because, just like you (Scott Thomas) said, your mother was very chatty.</p>
      <p>“All the women in our family never really do stop talking, and I’ve got hours of Bubbles, and she is actually in the documentary, but I do feel it should be part of the national curriculum, we should have all our grandchildren – well, not my grandchildren, I always age myself up – but my children, I want them to talk to my parents and there should be this handing down.</p>
      <p>“And also what struck me watching that is that there is all this silence around trauma, so it needs time for people to make sense of it</p>
      <p>“We were lucky – it’s the time for people to speak and for us to find out. The whole thing was extraordinary, and I hope that you find it as stimulating as I did.”</p>
      <p>My Grandparents’ War starts on Channel 4 on Wednesday November 27.</p>
