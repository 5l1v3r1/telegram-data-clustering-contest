      <p>We already know Huawei is gearing up to <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_matepad_pro_launch_date-news-40112.php">unveil</a> its next flagship tablet - the MatePad Pro on November 25. It’s going to be the first time we see a punch-hole display on a tablet and now the device passed through Geekbench to confirm its key specs and flex its processing might.</p>

      <p>The slate appeared on Geekbench with the MRX-AL09 model number and managed 3,808 points in the single-core test and 11,832 in the multi-core part. As expected it's packing an eight-core Kirin chipset with a base clock speed of 1.84 GHz, which matches the Kirin 990 chipset. The listing also shows 6GB RAM onboard alongside Android 10.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, we came across a 3C <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_matepad_pro_passes_certification_on_3c_database_-news-39982.php">listing</a> which confirmed the MatePad Pro is coming with 40W Huawei SuperCharge like the Mate 30 series. We also learned that there will be an alleged LTE version dubbed the MRX-W09.</p>
      <p>In related news, a Bluetooth certification hints that Huawei might also release a 5G version of the tablet which appeared with the MRX-AN09 model number.</p>

      <p>Past Huawei 5G phones like the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_20_x_(5g)-9705.php">Mate X 20 X (5G)</a> also featured an “N” letter in their model number so this signals a 5G MediaPad Pro is on the way as well. This version of the tablet would also come with the top of the line Kirin 990 5G chipset.</p>
