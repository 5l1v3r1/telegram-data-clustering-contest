        <b>The sacking of Mauricio Pochettino has not impressed Gary Lineker, who said: "He helped the club to punch massively above their weight."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and England striker <b>Gary Lineker says the club will not find a better manager</b> than Mauricio Pochettino, after the Argentinian was relieved of his duties.</p>
      <p>Spurs confirmed the departure of Pochettino, along with his coaching staff<b> Jesus Perez, Miguel D'Agostino and Antoni Jimenez</b>, in a club statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The news comes after Tottenham made a dismal start to the 2019-20 season, winning just three of their first 12 Premier League games and <b>suffering a humiliating 7-2 home defeat to Bayern Munich</b> in the Champions League. Yet although he was unable to win a trophy<b> during his five-and-a-half-year stint in north London</b>, Pochettino's standing remained high after he guided Spurs to four successive top-four finishes and last season's Champions League final, which they lost to Liverpool.</p>
