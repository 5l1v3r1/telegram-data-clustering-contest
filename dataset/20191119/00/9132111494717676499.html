      <p>Men, although according to history books were created first, as well as being head of the family in many homes across the globe, are arguably least appreciated between the two main genders.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned, despite being debatable, has brought to light the observation of International Men’s Day.</p>
      <p>According to Wikipedia, the event is celebrated on 19th November annually with the objectives of the celebration set out in sic pillars.</p>
      <p>The six pillars of International Men's Day include focusing on men's and boys' health, improving gender relations, promoting gender equality, highlighting discrimination against men, and promoting male role models.</p>
      <p>It is an occasion to celebrate boys and men's achievements and contributions, in particular for their contributions to community, family, marriage, and childcare.</p>
      <p>As part of the celebrations, www.ghanaweb.com has compiled a list of some prominent men worthy to be emulated by young men in Ghana.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Kofi Annan</b>

      <p>Among his many legacies include the ability to maintain his Ghanaian English accent despite being the most travelled diplomat in the country.</p>
      <p>This feat is especially worthy of emulation by young men in an era where people adopt the accents of countries they travel to regardless of the duration of their stay.</p>
