      <p>Chelsea hotel 11 Cadogan Gardens has joined the luxury hotel and restaurant collection Relais and Chateaux as its only London member.</p>
      <p>The 56-room property is located close to Sloane Square, and was built in the late 19th century, originally comprising four Victorian townhouses.</p>
      <p>Previously a private members’ club, <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2012/07/26/no11-cadogan-gardens-becomes-hotel/"><b>it reopened as a luxury boutique hotel in 2012</b></a>, and is part of the Iconic Luxury Hotels Group, along with sister properties and fellow Relais and Chateaux members Chewton Glen and Cliveden House.</p>
      <p>Facilities include a library with log fire, two private outdoor terraces, self-contained apartments with private garages, and a gym.</p>
      <p>Last year the hotel opened new restaurant Hans’ Bar and Grill, which opens out onto Pavilion Road.</p>

The hotel is perfectly located and will offer a delicious immersion into London for our guests.”</p>
