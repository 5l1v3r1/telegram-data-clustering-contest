      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - Jurors will resume deliberations at a trial against the owner of a now-closed Phoenix body donation facility accused of mishandling donated human remains.</p>
      <p>Tuesday will mark the fifth day of deliberations at the civil trial of Stephen Gore, owner of the Biological Resource Center of Arizona.</p>
      <p>Gore is accused of deceiving donor families about how the remains would be used.</p>
      <p>The relatives of more than 20 people whose remains were donated to Gore’s business alleged the facility claimed the bodies would be used for medical research, when in at least two cases it knew the remains would be sold for use in destructive military testing.</p>
      <p>Gore denied the allegations.</p>
