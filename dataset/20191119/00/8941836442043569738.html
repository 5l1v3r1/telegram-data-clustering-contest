      <h1>GOP-requested witness rejects Trump ‘conspiracy theories’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">COLLEEN LONG and ERIC TUCKER</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Sought by Republicans to testify, the former U.S. special envoy to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> spoke up instead for Democrat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a> in Tuesday’s impeachment hearings, rejecting “conspiracy theories” embraced by President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> and some of his allies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Kurt Volker</a> said he has known <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> as an honorable man for more than two decades, rebuffing debunked corruption allegations that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> is said to have wanted the Ukrainians to investigate in exchange for military aid to hold off Russian aggression.</p>
      <p>“The allegations against Vice President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> are self-serving and non-credible,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> declared.</p>
      <p>Broader corruption in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> was “plausible,” but corruption by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> wasn’t, he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> testified alongside former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> national security official Tim Morrison in the second hearing of the day in the House’s impeachment inquiry, only the fourth in history against a U.S. president.</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>Morrison, also requested by GOP members on the House Intelligence Committee, said at the outset that he was not there to question the “character or integrity” of any of his colleagues, though earlier Tuesday Republican lawmakers used his prior comments to try to discredit another witness, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> even circulated a tweet that was an earlier quote by Morrison questioning Vindman’s judgment.</p>
      <p>Democrats say there may be grounds for impeachment in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s push for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s new leadership to investigate his Democratic rival and the 2016 U.S. election as he withheld military assistance approved by Congress.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> says he did nothing wrong and dismissed the hearings as a “kangaroo court.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> was the first person to come behind closed doors in the inquiry that started in September, resigning his position shortly before he did so.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Since then, a parade of witnesses has testified publicly and privately about what they recalled about the July 25 phone call between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s new leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Many of those statements cast doubt on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a>’s account that he didn’t know the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> gas company <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma/">Burisma</a> was tied to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>, and that he wasn’t aware of a possible quid pro quo offered by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>.</p>
        <p>A number of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> and State Department officials were listening to the call, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> was not.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he said he opposed any hold on security assistance. And he said, “I did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma/">Burisma</a>, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>. I drew a distinction between the two.”</p>
        <p>Even though, he said, he understood that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a>’s son Hunter had been a board member — and he himself had been deeply involved with Ukrainian officials on a statement, never released, that would have committed the country to investigating <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma/">Burisma</a> and the 2016 U.S. election.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> himself requested a meeting on July 19 with Rudy Giuliani, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s personal lawyer, at which Giuliani mentioned accusations about the Bidens as well as the discredited theory that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.</p>
        <p>He said he believes now, thanks to hindsight and the testimony of other witnesses, that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> was using the aid to pressure <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> to investigate Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> and his role on the company’s board.</p>
        <p>“In retrospect I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> testified.</p>
        <p>Yet he also acknowledged that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> never told him he was withholding aid for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> unless there were investigations. He also said Ukrainians never told him that they wouldn’t get a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> visit or military aid without committing to investigations. He said he would have objected had the president asked him to get <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> to do investigations.</p>
        <p>Morrison, who stepped down from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s National Security Council shortly before he appeared behind closed doors last month, said he was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s July 25 call with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s leader, testimony that Republicans have repeatedly highlighted.</p>
        <p>“As I stated during my deposition, I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington’s political climate,” he said Tuesday. “My fears have been realized.”</p>
        <p>He told lawmakers Tuesday that the transcript of the call was incorrectly placed in a highly secure location.</p>
        <p>Democrats have seen ill intent in that action, but he said, “It was a mistake … an administrative error.”</p>
        <p>Morrison has confirmed to investigators that he witnessed a key September conversation in Warsaw between Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and a Ukrainian official. Sondland told the official that U.S. aid might be freed if the country’s top prosecutor “would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma/">Burisma</a> investigation,” Morrison said in previous closed-door testimony.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> shifted his account of a pivotal July 10 interaction at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a>. In his closed-door interview last month, he said there was no discussion of Giuliani’s activities in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> or investigations sought by the president.</p>
        <p>But on Tuesday, he said the meeting was essentially over when Sondland made a “general” comment about investigations.</p>
        <p>“I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> said.</p>
        <p>A series of text messages <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> provided to lawmakers showed conversations between him, Sondland and another envoy in which they discussed a need for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> to launch investigations, including into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/burisma/">Burisma</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> said meeting with Giuliani was just part of the dialogue, and he had one in-person meeting with him, in which Giuliani “raised, and I rejected, the conspiracy theory that Vice President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joe-biden/">Biden</a> would have been influenced in his duties as vice president by money paid to his son.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> also said a senior aide to Zelenskiy approached him last summer to ask to be connected to Giuliani. He said he made clear to the Zelenskiy aide, Andriy Yermak, that Giuliani was a private citizen and not a representative of the U.S. government.</p>
        <p>He testified he wasn’t part of an irregular foreign policy channel led Giuliani, as others have testified. He also rejected the idea that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> dubbed him, Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry the “three amigos” in charge of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> policy.</p>
        <p>“My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kurt-volker/">Volker</a> said.</p>
