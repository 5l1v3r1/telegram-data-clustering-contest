      <p>TOKYO (AP) - Japanese pitcher <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shun-yamaguchi/">Shun Yamaguchi</a>, who led Japan’s Central League in wins, strikeouts and winning percentage this season, says he wants to move to the major leagues through the posting system.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old right-hander declared his intention this week and becomes the first player from the Yomiuri Giants to pursue a career in the majors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shun-yamaguchi/">Yamaguchi</a> went 15-4 this season with 188 strikeouts and a .789 winning percentage, helping Yomiuri to its first CL pennant in five years.</p>
      <p>He signed with the Giants before the 2016 season after leaving the DeNA BayStars as a free agent.</p>
      <p>The posting system allows Japanese players under contract to negotiate with major league teams. If a contract is reached, their Japanese club receives a transfer fee based on a percentage of the value of the player’s contract.</p>
