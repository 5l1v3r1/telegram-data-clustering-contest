      <p>Starting next year Italian schools will be required by law to study climate change in every grade. The announcement came on the heels of historic flooding in Venice.While flooding in Venice can be partially attributable to climate change, my colleague <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/11/16/venice-flooding-reveals-a-real-hoax-about-climate-changeframing-it-as-eitheror/#46788f3c3a12">Marshall Shepherd</a> has a great piece on why that’s not the whole story.</p>
      <p>The new Italian policy will require students to, at first, study 33 hours per school year on climate change and sustainability.</p>
      <p>This will make Italy the first country to have mandatory coursework focused on climate change in all public schools. Italy’s Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti told Reuters, “I want to make the Italian education system the first education system that puts the environment and society at the core of everything we learn in school.”</p>
      <p>Fioramonti’s green centered and progressive policies led to a push for climate change education in grade schools as a way to prepare future Italian generations for the changes to come.</p>

      <p>Starting September 2020 children will begin to see climate change coursework sprinkled into their existing courses. Climate change will be taught within geography, civics, math, physics, etc., courses as a way to connect the changes in our world to practically everything else.</p>
      <p>Fioramonti belongs to the antiestablishment Five Star Movement, a left-leaning political party that embraces the new education requirements. However, the new policies aren’t popular throughout Italy. Many from the right-wing League Party have criticized the new law.</p>
      <h3>Support For Climate Education In The United States</h3>
      <p>While the United States has no federal mandate for teaching climate change in schools, it is widely popular among American parents. Recent surveys found that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/714262267/most-teachers-dont-teach-climate-change-4-in-5-parents-wish-they-did">80% of parents support</a> teaching climate change in schools.</p>
      <p>Another study found that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-most-americans-say-climate-change-should-be-addressed-now-2019-09-15/">70% of Americans</a> believe human activity contributes to climate change and that the majority of them have a personal responsibility to fix it.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>With 70% of Americans saying humans have a role in climate change, more than two-thirds believe it is a crisis or a serious problem. Only 16% believe it is not a problem and that we should do nothing about it.</p>
      <p>These statistics come in opposition to President Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html">pull-out from the Paris Agreement</a>, to which he recently served official papers to remove the United States from the agreement.</p>
      <p>As younger generations continue to grow in their voice for change, it is unclear whether change will come from the current leaders of the world or whether change will only come as younger generations increasingly control more power on the global stage.</p>
