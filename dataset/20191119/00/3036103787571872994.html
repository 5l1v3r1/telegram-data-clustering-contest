      <h1>Mobile subscribers in South Africa – Vodacom vs MTN vs Cell C vs Telkom</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>While major South African operators have seen subdued subscriber growth over the past year, Telkom has been fighting back with an impressive increase in mobile users.</p>
      <p>Telkom’s mobile subscribers have increased by a staggering 75.7% over the last year, with the operator now boasting 11.5 million customers.</p>
      <p>This subscriber base comprises 9.4 million prepaid and 2.1 million postpaid customers. The number of prepaid customers almost doubled compared to last year, while postpaid subscribers grew by 26.1%</p>
      <p>Telkom noted that the growth was paired with a decline in prepaid and postpaid ARPU, although its mobile service revenue still saw strong growth of 56.6%.</p>
      <p>“Our mobile business continues to be the fastest-growing business in the market with market share gain underpinned by our affordable broadband-led propositions, which continue to resonate with customers,” Telkom said.</p>
      <h3>Growth and competition</h3>
      <p>While Telkom’s mobile subscriber numbers continue to soar, MTN and Vodacom look relatively stagnant.</p>
      <p>These operators have seen slight increases in their subscriber numbers, but nowhere near the massive growth experienced by Telkom Mobile.</p>
      <p>Cell C is in an especially vulnerable position, as Telkom is now nearing its size in terms of mobile customers.</p>
      <p>Excluding broadband, wholesale, MVNO, and business service provider customers, Cell C is left with a total of 13.6 million subscribers.</p>
      <p>This places it within Telkom’s crosshairs, as it is only around 2 million subscribers ahead while being in a more precarious financial position.</p>
      <p>We compared the real customer base of Telkom, MTN, Vodacom, and Cell C according to their latest published trading results.</p>
      <h3>Mobile subscribers</h3>
