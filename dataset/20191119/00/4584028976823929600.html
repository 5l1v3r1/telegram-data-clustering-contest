      <h1>Reggae Boyz lacked effort in lacklustre draw against Guyana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sportsmax.tv/index.php/studentwriters/itemlist/user/805-leightonlevy" target="_blank">Leighton Levy</a></address>
      <p>The management team of the Reggae Boyz have expressed disappointment at the performance against Guyana at the Montego Bay Sports Complex on Monday night.</p>
      <p>They feel that complacency might have been a factor but still lamented the lack of a more professional approach.</p>
      <p>Playing at home in their final CONCACAF Nations League Group C match, the Reggae Boyz made five changes to the team that defeated Antigua 2-0 at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Friday, November 15. The coaching staff brought in goalkeeper Akeem Chambers, centre-back Ajani Talbot, midfielder Kevaughn Isaacs as well as Javon East and Peter Lee Vassell for Monday night’s encounter.</p>
      <p>However, despite playing before their home crowd, the team conceded their first goal of the competition and subsequently dropped their first points in a lacklustre 1-1 draw against their South American rivals.</p>
      <p>Emery Welshman put the visitors ahead in virtually at the stroke of half-time to see Guyana leading at the break. However, Javon East, starting his first game for the national team during Group C play, drew Jamaica level five minutes after the resumption.</p>
      <p>In search of a winner, the Reggae Boyz eventually substituted East with Shamar Nicholson, but were unable to find the game-winning goal and thus lost their 100 per cent win record having emerged victorious in their previous five group games during which they scored 20 goals while keeping a clean sheet on each occasion.</p>
      <p>Jamaica had already been promoted to Group A following their 2-0 victory over Antigua and Barbuda on November 15, and could perhaps explain the underwhelming performance before a disappointed home crowd. However, according to team manager Roy Simpson, this was not the performance the coaches were hoping for.</p>
      <p>“We were not satisfied with the effort. If players are given the opportunity they would have to make use of it,” he said. “We didn’t think all the players gave the kind of effort required.”</p>
      <p>Simpson revealed that there was a lengthy team meeting afterwards where players were made aware of the dissatisfaction of the coaching staff. They were made aware that each time they get to play they had to bring their ‘A’ games to the pitch.</p>
      <p>“What became clear,” Simpson said, “is that we and the players have a lot of work to do. “Next year will not be a year where players get the opportunity.  We never wanted to drop points. We wanted to end with a more credible performance. How the team played was a big disappointment.”</p>
      <p>Earlier Monday night, Antigua came from behind twice to defeat Aruba 3-2 in the bottom-of-the-table Group C clash.</p>
      <p>The result means Aruba failed to win a point while Antigua finished third in the group with nine points, one behind Guyana, who, as runners' up, qualify for the 2021 Gold Cup qualifiers </p>
      <p>Jamaica topped the group with 16 points.</p>
