      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/blazers/2019/11/19/carmelo-anthony-calls-blazers-signing-perfect-opportunity/4236270002">USA Today</a></i> and <i><a href="https://apnews.com/96db97e4e809405093893fcc845bd02c">The AP</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“What happened before is the past, I can’t dwell on that. I learned from that,” Anthony said in the video. “Me and [Damian Lillard], we’ve been talking for the past couple years, off and on. I just look at that opportunity, that team, and say, ‘Look, this is what I can bring to the team. This is where I can help.’ It will only work if all parties see it the same way.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>The Blazers hope there is enough game left in the 35-year-old forward to help them overcome a 5-9 start.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“This happened at a point in my life where I do have a lot of clarity and understanding of different situations and just life,” Anthony added. “My approach is totally different.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>The agreement was not formalized until Tuesday when he signed a nonguaranteed contract that goes through January. If he stays, the contract becomes guaranteed for the rest of the season.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Carmelo is an established star in this league that will provide a respected presence in our locker room and a skill set at a position of need on the floor,” Neil Olshey, Portland’s president of basketball operations, said in a statement.</i>
