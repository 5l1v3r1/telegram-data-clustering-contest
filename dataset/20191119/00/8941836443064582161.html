      <p>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - A 35-year-old Topeka man was sentenced to nine years in federal prison for cyberstalking a former co-worker by using her identity to post sexual content.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/blake-adam-austin/">Blake Adam Austin</a> was sentenced Tuesday for cyberstalking and possessing and distributing child pornography.</p>
      <p>The investigation began when a middle school teacher in Topeka reported receiving emails from males responding to a Craigslist ad in which someone used the victim’s identity to post sexual content.</p>
      <p>The problem continued for years until an investigator identified an account <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/blake-adam-austin/">Austin</a> was using to post sexual content and the victim’s contact information.</p>
      <p>The woman said she had worked with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/blake-adam-austin/">Austin</a> at a coffee shop and had rejected his attempts to initiate a relationship.</p>
