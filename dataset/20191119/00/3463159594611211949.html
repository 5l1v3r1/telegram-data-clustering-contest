      <h1>Official poster of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Paraguay 2019™ revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">FIFA.com</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday 19 November, two days before the big kick-off, FIFA and the Local Organising Committee unveiled the official poster of the <a href="https://fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/">FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Paraguay 2019™.</a></p>
      <p>The poster’s thought-provoking images exude energy and instantly command your attention, depicting distinctive elements of beach soccer, such as a bare foot – angled perfectly for a shot – and the sweep of sand it kicks up.</p>
      <p>The foot itself displays the patterns and colours of the official match ball, which appear in ever-greater detail as it gets nearer.</p>
      <p>At the moment of impact, the colours and pattern of the ball represent the movement and energy of the game as a whole, passing through the player's foot.</p>
      <p>The influences of Guarani culture and native Paraguayan motifs can be seen in the textures and patterns used, for example with the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>feathers: an important feature of Guarani garments</li>
        <li>triangles and diamonds: those depicted coming off the ball and being absorbed by the player were inspired by the traditional patterns of Paraguayan design</li>
        <li>leaves and solar shapes: elements part of the tournament <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/news/official-poster-of-the-fifa-beach-soccer-world-cup-paraguay-2019tm-revealed">emblem</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that the 10th edition of the competition will be held in its entirety at the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/beachsoccerworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium/400095751/">Los Pyinandi World Cup Stadium</a> in Asuncion between 21 November and 1 December.</p>
