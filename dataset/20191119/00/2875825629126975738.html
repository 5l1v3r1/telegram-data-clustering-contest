      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino holds crisis talks with Daniel Levy over potential Tottenham exit</h1>
      <h2>The Argentinean has been feeling the pressure following Spurs' woeful recent form and his time at the club may well be drawing to an end</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:30:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly met with chairman Daniel Levy to discuss his future as speculation grows that his exit could be imminent.</p>
      <p>Despite reaching the Champions League final last season Spurs have disappointed so far in the current Premier League campaign and lie in 14th place, 11 points off the top four and just six points away from the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>There have been rumours that Pochettino has lost the dressing room, with a number of key players such as Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen looking to leave the club when their contracts end next summer, and Levy is said to be losing faith in the Argentinean.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/mauricio-pochettino-holds-crisis-talks-daniel-levy-tottenhams/">the Telegraph</a> the two men held talks during the international break, and it is becoming a matter of 'when' not 'if' Pochettino leaves, with Levy worrying that the season may only go from bad to worse.</p>
      <p>It is thought Levy would have to pay a hefty fee of Â£12.5m to sack Pochettino under the terms of his current contract, and Spurs are said to eyeing the likes of Jose Mourinho, Max Allegri and Eddie Howe as potential replacements.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known if Pochettino will still be in charge for Spurs' clash with London rivals <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday, but if he is defeat would surely seal his fate.</p>

      <p>Since his arrival from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> in 2014 Pochettino has been a hugely popular figure with Spurs fans, and he led the team to a top four finish four times in a row.</p>
      <p>So far the current season has been something of a disaster for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , however, with a number of humiliating losses including a 7-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, a loss to League 2 club Colchester in the Carabao Cup and a 3-0 humbling by <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> in the Premier League.</p>
