I knew him very well before we came together as man and wife. I was so sure about him before we got married.<br/><br/>“We wanted to keep our relationship on the low and surprise our loved one and that is exactly what we did," she told Graphic Showbiz.<br/><br/>Asked whether marriage had changed her, Victoria said nothing had really changed since she got married just that she has to get her priorities right. “I still do my normal things such as hanging out with friends, emceeing and basically doing the things I was doing when I was single. My husband comes first and the rest of the things follow and all this is possible because I have an understanding partner,” she said. <br/>On how she took all the controversies that she was involved in before and after her marriage, Victoria Lebene said she was never bothered about them because her man knows her inside out.<br/>“Once the man I am with is okay why I should bother about what others think? Whatever anyone says is no news to me so far as my man is okay with everything I do,” she said.</p>
