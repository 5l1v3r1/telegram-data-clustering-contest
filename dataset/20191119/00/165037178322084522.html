        <b>Lega Serie A president Gaetano Micciche announced on Tuesday he was stepping down from his position amid a probe into his election in March 2018.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Genoa owner <b>Enrico Preziosi's claims that there had been irregularities</b> concerning Micciche's election prompted an Italian Football Federation (FIGC) investigation.</p>
      <p><b>"I wish to announce my immediate resignation</b> as president of Lega Serie A," Micciche said in a statement.<b> "</b>The disclosures published today and related to the closure<b> </b>of the investigation on my appointment 20 months ago and its possible outcome are unacceptable and <b>required me to take this decision</b>."</p>

      <p>The investigation was opened following statements made by Preziosi, who had said "<b>when things are not done properly, the truth eventually erupts</b>."</p>
      <p>According to Italian media,<b> the Genoa president was referring to various procedural flaws </b>during Micciche's election.</p>
      <p>Micciche -- a 69-year-old native of Palermo in Sicily and president of the IMI investment bank --<b> had been nominated by Italian Olympic Committee </b>(CONI) president Giovanni Malago and elected unanimously by the 20 clubs of the Italian top flight. <b>The position had been vacant </b>for more than a year before Micciche, who is also a FIGC vice-president, took over.</p>
