      <h1>Huawei Watch GT 2 and FreeBuds 3 will launch in India in two weeks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=12" target="_blank">Peter</a></address>
      <p>Along with the new Mate flagships, Huawei unveiled the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_watch_gt_2-9888.php">Watch GT 2</a> and the FreeBuds 3 last month. These two will be launching in India soon – sources have told us that they will be available in the first week of December.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_freebuds_3_review-news-40012.php">We reviewed</a> the FreeBuds 3 and were pretty happy with them – they are competitively priced with ANC and USB-C wireless charging.</p>

      <p>Anyway, according to leakster <a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1196767615798013952">Ishan Agarwal</a> the Huawei Watch GT 2 will be available in both versions – 46mm and 42mm.</p>
      <p>By the way, Huawei had plans to bring the Kirin 990 chipset <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_to_bring_the_kirin_990_to_india-news-39222.php">to India</a>, but there’s nothing yet. The Mate 30 flagships seem unlikely, but perhaps one of the 990-powered mid-rangers may make an appearance (the rumor mill is tracking the Huawei nova 6 and the Honor V30).</p>
