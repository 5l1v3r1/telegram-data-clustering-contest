        <b>Before the PlayStation 4 came out, armchair analysts projected the death of the console. Instead, it has sold 90 million units and counting. Console gaming isn't going away anytime soon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And if you didn't already assume that, well, Sony has made it official: the company has been sharing official details on the next PlayStation home console, which it has confirmed is called the PlayStation 5.</p>
      <p>It won't be out right away, but Sony has already shared enough information to give us a very strong idea of what to expect from the PS5. Here's what we know so far, and we'll be updating this story over time as new details and leaks emerge.</p>

      <h4>When will the Sony PlayStation 5 be out?</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Holiday 2020! That is official, straight from Sony. Before, all we had been told was "not 2019," but now we can mark our calendars.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Development kits are already in the hands of developers, so that they have enough time to prep launch games. Given that the PS4 released in 2013, it's about time for the next generation to roll out, anyway.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Fact or fiction?</h3>
      <p>We've got about a year left before the PS5 arrives.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>How much will the Sony PlayStation 5 cost?</h4>
      <p>
        <b>It's too early for anything official. When asked about price, here's what Cerny <a href="https://twitter.com/provenself/status/1118212881760174080">told Wired's reporter</a>: "I believe that we will be able to release it at an SRP [suggested retail price] that will be appealing to gamers in light of its advanced feature set."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, it's entirely possible to read into that as much as you'd like. Given what truly does sound like a powerful set of innards (keep reading), we have to imagine it'll be pricier than the PS4 was at launch. On the other hand, Sony learned a hard lesson from the overpriced PS3 and adjusted accordingly the next time around, so the company will have to be careful here.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Fact or fiction?</h3>
      <p>If we had to guess, we'd say something in the £449-499 ballpark wouldn't shock us.</p>

      <p>
        <b>We have no real sense of Sony's aesthetic for this generation, given that each previous PlayStation console has really taken on its own form – and then other forms once revised.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This bit is confirmed, however: the PlayStation 5 will still play physical media, although Blu-ray hasn't specifically been confirmed just yet. No, Sony isn't ready to give up entirely on brick-and-mortar shops and their real-world foot traffic, even if more and more people seem keen on quick-and-easy digital purchases.</p>
      <p>What you see above is a <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/sony-playstation-5-console/">sketch from a Sony patent application</a> that frankly looks too ridiculous to be a real console... yet <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exclusive-playstation-5/">Wired's report</a> suggests that the real devkit actually looks pretty similar to that. We <i>do not</i> expect to see this kind of design on store shelves in a year, but that's still an interesting detail.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Fact or fiction?</h3>
      <p>Given the need for physical media, it probably won't be tiny. But we expect something much sleeker and less aggressive-looking than that sketch above.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>How much power will the Sony PlayStation 5 pack?</h4>

        <b>Here's one area in which we have hard details. Cerny's chat with Wired didn't get too deep into the vision behind the console, but it definitely dug into tech specs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It'll have a CPU based on AMD's third-gen Ryzen, with an eight-core 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture. Meanwhile, the GPU is a custom version of Radeon's Navi and it supports real-time ray tracing, which delivers ultra-realistic (and seriously stunning) lighting effects. According to the Wired article, the PS5 will also support 8K resolution, although it's not clear whether that'll be native or upscaled.</p>
      <p>The PlayStation 5 will also put a big premium on 3D audio techniques via the AMD processor, whether you're using a headset or TV speakers.</p>
      <p>And while system storage for a console seems uninteresting beyond the sheer amount of it, the PlayStation 5 is different: it'll have a solid-state drive (SSD) that can dramatically cut down on loading times for games. It's unclear whether the system will <i>only</i> have an SSD or if it will complement a larger, traditional hard drive, but it'll be in there.</p>
      <p>Cerny demoed the effect to Wired in <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/game-reviews/marvels-spider-man/review"><i>Spider-Man</i></a> for PlayStation 4, and it cut down fast-travel time from 15 seconds to 0.8 seconds. Yes, less than one second. That's incredible.</p>
      <p>In late May, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2019/GNS_E.pdf">touted a similar figure</a> in a presentation for its Investor Relations day event, showing footage of a Spider-Man level loading in just over 8 seconds on PS4 Pro... and at just 0.83 seconds on PlayStation 5. Sony also showed how the next-gen hardware could better keep up with a speedy jaunt through an open world, keeping pace as it loaded almost seamlessly while the PS4 Pro version got bogged down a couple times along the way.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Fact or fiction?</h3>
      <p>Unless Sony is bluffing, it's fact. Sounds impressive. Let's see it in action!</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>What will the controller be like?</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.stuff.tv/sites/stuff.tv/files/styles/main-full-width-mobile-retina/public/brands/Sony/PS5/ps5-controller-patent.png?itok=oxbRqTam&amp;timestamp=1574192876"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Sony has <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/10/08/an-update-on-next-gen-playstation-5-launches-holiday-2020/">shared some key details</a> on what to expect from the PlayStation 5's controller, which we assume will probably be called the DualShock 5. Tradition and all.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The old rumble technology will be replaced with more sensitive haptic feedback, like you see on phones, providing more flexibility for developers. More interestingly, the controller will have L2 and R2 "adaptive triggers" that can be programmed for different levels of resistance, changing the kind of tactile feel you get from the play experience. That sounds pretty neat.</p>
      <p>Sony told Wired that the PS5 controller will be a little bit heavier than the current DualShock 4, given the added tech, but it will be lighter than the Xbox One controller with batteries installed.</p>
      <p>What you're seeing above is a <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/DE/JP-2019-005960/0A493D7BB9C01BA4712B57A8318A7208A68420EF54F725A2D4AC928C7B752081/30/ja">recent Sony patent image</a> from Japan that might show the revised design of the PlayStation 5's controller. Surprise: It's nearly identical. The grips are a bit more bulbous, and the touch bar doesn't appear to wrap over the top anymore either. Additionally, there's a USB-C port on the back, and the light bar is apparently gone now. Also, we don't yet know what the little rectangle thing (a light?) is beneath the home button.</p>
      <p>Still, it shows very slight evolution rather than revolution, which makes sense given that the DualShock 4 is already a fantastic controller. Give us better battery life and we'll probably consider it a spectacular upgrade.</p>
      <h4>Which games will be on the Sony PlayStation 5?</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Did you see the part above about <i>Spider-Man</i> for PS4? Yes, that means that the PlayStation 5 will be backwards-compatible with current-gen games. That means modern classics like <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/game-reviews/god-war/review"><i>God of War</i></a> (shown) and <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/game-reviews/horizon-zero-dawn/review"><i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i></a> will still be playable. Hooray for Sony.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Beyond that, we can only speculate about which games on the horizon will ultimately appear on PlayStation 5 instead of – or more likely, in addition to – PlayStation 4. For example, something like CD Projekt RED's <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> seems like a safe bet. Naughty Dog's <i>The Last of Us Part II</i> too, no doubt. And when asked about Kojima Productions' <i>Death Stranding</i>, Wired said that Cerny's body language suggested that a dual PS4/PS5 release is likely.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the report claims that many games will launch for both PlayStation 4 and 5, offering a better experience for new hardware buyers without completely shunning those who aren't ready to make the leap.</p>
      <p>Sony's Investor Relations Day presentation also pointed to a larger focus on streaming games in the future, suggesting that it will be just as viable an option for new games as Blu-ray discs and downloads. The PlayStation Now service already streams older games, but it sounds like Sony plans to push the technology and make it a much larger focus going forward. And with streaming games, you don't even need a powerful console since the computing happens elsewhere - but you'll still get the best experience when everything's running locally.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Fact or fiction?</h3>
      <p>Backwards compatibility is smart, and we have to imagine that any major announced game that's still somewhat out on the horizon will probably hit PS5.</p>

      <h4>What about VR on the Sony PlayStation 5?</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.stuff.tv/sites/stuff.tv/files/styles/main-full-width-mobile-retina/public/brands/Sony/PS_VR/review-pics/psvr_headset_1.jpg?itok=qXWrjCvr&amp;timestamp=1509269581"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>The <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/sony/playstation-vr/review">PlayStation VR</a> is still a fairly niche offering, with only about 5% of PS4 owners buying one – but with 4 million units sold, it's still leading the VR headset pack. And Sony's not done with it yet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cerny confirmed that the current PlayStation VR headset will work with the PlayStation 5, but couldn't talk about the possibility of a next-gen version. We have to imagine Sony is prepping a more advanced version, but there's nothing official to go on right now.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Fact or fiction?</h3>
      <p>At the very least, PlayStation VR will live to see another console generation. Whether or not we get a new and improved headset remains to be seen.</p>
