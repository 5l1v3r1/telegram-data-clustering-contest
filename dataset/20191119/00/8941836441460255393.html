      <p>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - A Tucson man has been sentenced to 12 days in jail for assaulting a supporter of President Donald Trump last year on a city street.</p>
      <p>Pima County prosecutors say 43-year-old Daniel Brito pleaded guilty last month to aggravated assault on an incapacitated victim and theft by control.</p>
      <p>Court documents show the victim was wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat and carrying a “vote Republican” sign days before the November 2018 election when he passed Brito on a street.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Daily Star reports Brito tried to snatch the man’s hat from behind and started a fight.</p>
      <p>Tucson police say the Trump supporter suffered a broken ankle and Brito also punched the injured man multiple times in the head.</p>
