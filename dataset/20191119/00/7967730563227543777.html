        <b>Edmond (Ted) Worsley: January10, 1923-October 30, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a foundation member of the SDI (Society of Designers for Industry), later to become the Design Institute of Australia, Ted Worsley’s sad death recently, at the age of 96, was a significant passing.</p>
      <p>Ted was a member of the inaugural class of the RMIT industrial design diploma in 1947 with fellow students Clement Meadmore and Jack Crow, among others. Ted was involved in the establishment of the student body of the Society of Designers for Industry, which was formed to engage in public activity to promote industrial design as a profession. Following the formation of the society and its evolvement into the fifties, Ted became its secretary, under the presidency of Ron Rosenfeldt.</p>
      <p>Ted formed a very successful partnership in 1954, with fellow student Jack Crow, and established Stuart Furniture in Toorak Road, South Yarra, and represented many local designers, including Bill and Keera Le Lievre, Gerald Easden and Roger Putnam.</p>
      <p>Moving into education in 1969 at the Prahran College of Advanced Education, Ted became Head of the Department of Art &amp; Design until 1972. From 1972 to 1974 he was the Victorian state director of the Industrial Design Council of Australia. This was a significant entity and acted as an advisory body to government to establish design engagement with industry. From 1974 to 1979 he was the principal lecturer at the Caulfield Institute of Technology, and during this period he was seconded to the Department of Education, Canberra, as acting director, Canberra School of Art (1976-1977)</p>
      <p>Ted retired in 1984 as head of Department of Graphic Design, Chisholm Institute of Technology (now Monash University) and he had gone onto to contribute to advisory boards (Box Hill TAFE) and councils in the field of design education in Victoria. Ted was a fellow of the DIA, and in 2016 he was inducted into the hall of fame in Adelaide.</p>
      <p>Ted had a long and distinguished career in design, and design education, and a 70-plus-year involvement with the Design Institute of Australia. His enthusiasm and engagement with his profession was highly appreciated, and he is owed a debt of gratitude for his dedication and foresight by all designers across all the disciplines.</p>
      <p>Ted was loved by his former wife Jean (deceased) and his stepsons Robert and Jonathan, grand children Elinor, Christopher, and Alexandra, and daughter-in-law Julie.</p>
