      <p>T-Mobile has made a few big announcements recently that are tied to its proposed merger with Sprint, but according to one of the state attorneys general leading the lawsuit to block the merger, those commitments aren’t enough.</p>
      <p>During a press conference today related to <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-sues-juul-labs">a lawsuit against vape company Juul</a>, New York Attorney General Letitia James was asked about T-Mobile’s recent promise to make investments in the state and whether it could lead to an agreement between T-Mo and James. The New York AG was the one to <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/06/new-york-attorney-general-states-lawsuit-block-t-mobile-sprint-merger/">announce the lawsuit against T-Mobile and Sprint’s merger</a> and is one of its key participants.</p>
      <p>In response to the question, James says that T-Mobile’s promises do not address the concerns that the group of state AGs have with the proposed merger. “Our case against T-Mobile is an antitrust violation, obviously we’re concerned with anti-competitive behavior,” James explains. “So providing public benefits are good, but it does not address the antitrust violations.”</p>
      <p>T-Mobile said last week that if its merger with Sprint is completed, it will <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/t-mobile-customer-experience-center-nassau-county-sprint-merger/">build a Customer Experience Center in New York’s Nassau County</a>. The carrier claims that this customer support facility will create up to 1,000 local jobs and that the buildout of the site will help create indirect jobs in areas like construction.</p>
      <p>In addition to its pledge to create five Customer Experience centers in total if the Sprint merger is allowed to happen, T-Mo recently announced <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/new-t-mobile-un-carrier-1-0-first-responders-project-10-million-connect-plan/">three New T-Mobile Un-carrier 1.0 moves</a> that it will make if the merger is completed. Those include free service for first responders, free internet access for eligible families to help students do schoolwork, and a low-cost rate plan that’ll include unlimited talk and text as well as 2GB of data for $15 per month.</p>
      <p>The trial for the state AGs’ lawsuit is set to begin on December 9th.</p>
