      <p>Xbox Game Pass subscribers have been given yet another reason to bless their investment. <i>The Red Lantern</i>–an upcoming dog-sledding, rogue-lite narrative-driven first-person adventure–is dropping straight onto the service on the day it’s released.In the Timberline Studio-produced game, which was announced earlier this year and has been scheduled for early 2020, was this month confirmed as the newest addition to Game Pass' future line-up. In it, you're put in the shoes of The Musher as she and her team of five sled dogs navigate the Alaskan wilderness in order to find their way home.</p>
      <p>The protagonist, voiced by the incredible Ashly Burch–best known for <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i>’s Aloy, <i>Borderlands</i>’ Tiny Tina and, most recently, the fantastic Parvati Holcomb from <i>The Outer Worlds</i>–initially sets out to train for <a href="https://iditarod.com/">the world-famous Iditarod race</a>, only to get lost, turning an initially exciting experience into a matter of life and death.</p>
      <p>With a firm focus on story, <i>The Red Lantern </i>places a massive focus on “hundreds of different events” that can occur, including “fending off bears, resisting frostbite, attending your dogs, or receiving a signature moose-licking.” You can choose how you interact with the world around you, whether you’re looking to hunt everything on your route with a trusty firearm, or take a more tempered approach and conserve your energy.</p>
      <p>The game’s preview content unsurprisingly highlights the bond between the player and their five dogs. Given that huskies can be infamously aggressive with even long-term owners, it’ll be interesting to see if neglect of ownership duties could also be a potential danger in the game, or if Timberline has created a softer bond between gamers and their canine companions.</p>

      <p>Alongside the Xbox One, <i>The Red Lantern </i>is also coming to the Nintendo Switch, where the game is given gyro controls in handheld mode, letting players look around at the exciting environments by turning the system.</p>
      <p>If it’s as good as it looks, <i>The Red Lantern</i> could be a signal that Microsoft is planning to maintain Game Pass’ impressive momentum and continuing to provide a platform for unique, brilliant and otherwise-overlooked titles. In 2019 alone, popular indie games made available upon release to subscribers include <i>Void Bastards</i>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2019/09/13/review-creature-in-the-well-is-weird-wonderful-and-well-worth-your-while/#2e7622182df3"><i>Creature in the Well</i></a>, <i>Descenders</i>, <i>For the King</i> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2019/10/15/review-felix-the-reaper-is-an-experience-at-odds-with-itself/#2c460e6d7a17"><i>Felix the Reaper</i></a>.</p>
