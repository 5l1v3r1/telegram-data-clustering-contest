      <p>The Crown star Josh O’Connor feels <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a> is ‘waiting for his mother to die so his life can have meaning’.</p>
      <p>The actor plays the real life prince in season three of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> drama, which is about the reign of Elizabeth II.</p>
      <p>As next in line to the throne, Josh described Prince Charles’ life – or at least his Netflix version of Prince Charles’ life – as being ‘in purgatory’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/jo%E2%80%8Bsh-o-connor-the-crown-se%E2%80%8Bason-3-interview">He told GQ Hype</a>: ‘What I’m gradually finding is a guy waiting for his mother to die for his life to have meaning. His whole life has been in purgatory.</p>
      <p>‘Waiting for your parent to die is pretty messed up. That the one person who should be unconditional is the person that holds the power for you to have any meaning in your life… it’s quite nice to play that. They’re huge stakes.’</p>

      <p>He prepared for such an incredible not by constantly swotting up on royal history (although he likely did do that), but by enjoying a favourite snack of the prince’s – boiled eggs.</p>
      <p>‘I am eating quite a lot of them,’ he explained, ‘because that’s what Charles does. He eats a lot of boiled eggs.’</p>

      <p>The God’s Own Country star has also been getting to grips with riding a horse a particular way for polo playing scenes.</p>
      <p>‘Charles holds the reins in a different way. Most people have four reins here, then thumb on top. He puts the reins in between each finger. So I learnt that as well. I love that.’</p>
