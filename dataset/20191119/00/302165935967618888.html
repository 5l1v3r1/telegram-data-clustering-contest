      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 19 — A woman who accuses Jeffrey Epstein of sexually abusing her as a child yesterday said Britain’s Prince Andrew should tell US authorities what he knows about the financier.</p>
      <p>“Prince Andrew, and any others who were close to Epstein, should come forward and give a statement under oath on what information they have,” the woman, calling herself Jane Doe 15, said at a news conference with her lawyer Gloria Allred.</p>
      <p>The woman yesterday became the latest of more than a dozen women to sue Epstein's estate, saying in her lawsuit that he subjected her to a “vicious, prolonged sexual assault” at his New Mexico ranch when she was 15.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty. Two days earlier he signed a will and put his estimated US$577 million (RM2.4 billion) estate into a trust.</p>
      <p>The financier once counted among his friends US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>In an interview on Saturday, Prince Andrew denied having sex with Virginia Giuffre, another of Epstein's alleged victims, who said in a previously filed lawsuit that she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the estate's executors could not be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>Epstein's brother and his lawyers have questioned a medical examiner's conclusion that his death was a suicide. Doe yesterday wore a bracelet with the words, “Epstein didn't kill himself.”</p>
      <p>Doe, who grew up in a poor family in the Midwest, met Epstein's secretary during a 2004 school trip to New York City. The secretary later invited her to view a magic show in Las Vegas and then fly to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in his private jet, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>The secretary said Epstein was interested in helping girls who were in difficult circumstances, and when Doe arrived, Epstein summoned her to give him a massage alone, and then sexually assaulted her, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>The executors Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn last week said they would seek to create a compensation fund for victims. The proposal must be approved by a court in the US Virgin Islands, which is overseeing the estate. — Reuters</p>
