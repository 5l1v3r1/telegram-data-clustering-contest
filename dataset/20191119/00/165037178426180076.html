      <p>"He was the head of the organisation," the source told AFP, saying the raids had also turned up various weapons,<b> including sidearms and rifles</b>, as well as paperwork.</p>
      <p><b>Contreras is currently being held at a police station in Malaga</b>. After starting out with Malaga, Contreras then spent several seasons at Marseille before moving to Greek side Aris Thessaloniki in a career which took him to Azerbaijan, Germany, Bolivia and the US.</p>
      <p>The police operation was dubbed "Operation MasKoke"<b> in a nod to the former striker's nickname "Koke"</b> -- not to be confused with the current Atletico Madrid captain Jorge Resurreccion Merodio, <b>who goes by the same moniker</b>. </p>
