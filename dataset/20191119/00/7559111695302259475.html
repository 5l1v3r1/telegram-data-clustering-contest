      <p><b>REVIEW</b> – I’ve been using an old-school flatbed scanner at work for years, but I don’t like using it. Mine was dusty and slow, so I was eager to test out the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500.  Did it make me a happy camper?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When not in use, the scanner’s feed tray folds up into a cover. It’s about the size of a shoe box.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-03.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The lid reveals the touch screen, and the bottom has a pull-out catch tray. You don’t need to pull out the bottom tray for the scanner to work.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-05.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Pop the hood and you can see the inner workings of the scanner. It’s just one straight path for the paper.</p>
      <p>Setup</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-06.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are only two connections in the back: power, and USB. The USB port has a tiny sliding door. Lift up to access, and insert the supplied cable.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-04.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You get an optional guide for feeding skinny items, such as receipts or business cards. If you scan a lot of these, this might be handy. It’s not required.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-07.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Here’s one of the setup screens. This screen lets you decide the startup mode. I’ve opted to have the lid power the scanner on and off since I don’t use it all day long.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-09.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I don’t have wifi at work, so I’ve connected it directly to a computer.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-08.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You have the option to connect to a smartphone as well. I’ve tested this with my Mac Mini.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-10.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Finally, the main screen. There are no physical buttons on the scanner, so all of your controls are via touch screen. Fortunately, they’re pretty easy to understand.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-11.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I just received my son’s 8th grade school photos, so what better time to test this scanner out?</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-12.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I’ve inserted the photo face down, “head first”.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-13.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Here’s the result: There’s zero retouching and the scanner was set on fully automatic. I think it turned out pretty good, but then again, I’m not a pixel peeper. Good enough for emailing family! It even got the odd black stripe in the upper right corner from the photo studio.</p>
      <figure>
        <video src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-14.gif" autoplay="" loop=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Of course, I had to try receipts. Here I’ve inserted a grocery receipt and selected the “RECEIPTS” preset. The Scanner is quick and easy to use.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fujitsu_scansnap_ix1500-14.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In the ScanSnap software (Mac shown) I was amazed to discover that each item scanned included some automatic character recognition to help me organize my files. I did zero configuration, yet there it was. Very handy!</p>
      <h3>What I like</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Works out of the box with minimal fooling around</li>
        <li>Speedy</li>
        <li>Software automatically reads text for file naming</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What I’d change</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Not a con, but I usually like physical buttons.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>The Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500 has earned a place in my office. It’s much faster and more convenient than my old flatbed.</p>
