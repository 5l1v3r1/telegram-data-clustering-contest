      <p>Three Ugandans made their countrymen proud at the weekend when they won their races in three countries.</p>
      <p>Stephen Kissa conquered the Seven Hills Race in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, ensuring that the 15km title was retained by a Ugandan for a fifth year running.</p>
      <p>He beat a strong field to win in a time of 41 minutes and 47 seconds on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“He’s a real road runner,” said his manager Jurrie van der Velden. This was Kissa’s second win and he has maintained a top-two finish in all four road races this year.</p>
      <p>The previous four editions were won by Joshua Cheptegei who set a world record of 41:05 last year. Cheptegei is preparing to break the 10K world record in Spain next month.</p>
      <p>“It was a 10-12-man strong race with a lot of 59’ half-marathon and 27’ 10K guys plus 2:03 marathoners.”</p>

      <p>Uganda’s wins did not stop there. In Japan, Geoffrey Kusuro won the ninth Kobe Marathon in a new course record time of 2:08:46. The previous mark for this World Athletics Bronze Label Race was at 2.12.49.</p>
      <p>“Kusuro had a 2:10 from the Ljubljana Marathon last year and this 2:08 on a tough course with no pacemakers is really a good performance.”</p>
      <p>In Spain, Maxwell Rotich was unmatched as he took home the men’s 10km title at the 26th ‘Cross Internacional de Soria’ in Soria.</p>
      <p>Rotich posted 29 minutes and 16 seconds for the seventh straight victory by a Ugandan at this race since Dickson Huru in 2013. Timothy Toroitich won it from 2014-2016 whereas Jacob Kiplimo won in 2017 and 2018.</p>
