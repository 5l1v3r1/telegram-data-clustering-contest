      <p>BRUSSELS (AP) - Belgium completed its Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a perfect record and another big win, routing Cyprus 6-1 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Kevin De Bruyne and Christian Benteke both scored twice for the Red Devils at the King Baudoin stadium as the hosts, which had already qualified as Group I winners, easily overturned an early deficit.</p>
      <p>Benteke canceled out defender Nicholas Ioannou’s opener in the 16th minute and Belgium was then in complete control for the remainder of the game.</p>
      <p>Forward Yannick Carrasco was also on the scoresheet for Belgium and Christoforou Kypros scored an own goal.</p>
      <p>Belgium lived up to its billing as the world’s top-ranked national team by scoring a qualifying-best 40 goals in 10 matches, with 15 different players netting. Roberto Martinez’s team only conceded three goals.</p>
