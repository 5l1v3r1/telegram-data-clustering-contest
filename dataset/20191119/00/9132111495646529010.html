      <p>There have been several reported cases of attacks on students at the University of Ghana, Legon. Students have come under attack due to poor lighting systems on some streets on campus and inadequate security personnel.</p>
      <p>Despite efforts by students to protect themselves from these robbers who are mostly armed, the number of attacks keeps on increasing. Management took a step in ensuring the safety of students by providing street lights on the Pentagon Hall road and clearing the bushes on that stretch.</p>
      <p>Information reaching Ghanaweb indicates that a male student of the university identified as Papa Ayensu has died after sustaining injuries from a knife attack by road robbers at the university campus.</p>
      <p>The student who is a resident at the Pentagon Hall was sent to the hospital for treatment but later died few days after receiving treatment.</p>
      <p>Attacks on students have become quite rampant and the phenomena has got students questioning their security status in the institution.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, May 4, 2019, a level 400 student was attacked and butchered on the road leading from the Africa Union hostels to Evandy hostel by suspected armed robbers. The robbers inflicted cutlass wounds on the student on the night of the attack. The student was transported to the 37 Military Hospital for medical attention.</p>
      <p>There have been other attacks on students at the night market and some parts of campus of the campus. In February this year, a boy was allegedly robbed and stabbed in his elbow around the mosque adjacent Ish 2. It is believed that the robbers hid in the bushes and attack their victims at the slightest opportunity.</p>
      <p>In the case of the attack on the final year student which occurred in May, Management of the University stated that a number of safety and security measures have been put in place to enhance security on campus both in the short and long term.</p>
      <p>With the recent development which has led to the death of a student, security measures need to be intensified to avert such attacks on students on campus.</p>
