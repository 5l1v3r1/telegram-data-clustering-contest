      <h1>Misinformed Apple Block Vaping Apps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Apple has made the rash decision to block applications that promote the use of e-cigarettes from its App Store despite the fact that the recent US’ epidemic’ has been linked to the circulation and use of illegal THC cartridges in black market cannabis vapes which contain vitamin E acetate, not e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Apple made the decision late last week to remove all 181 vaping-related apps from its mobile app store in response to the deaths of 42 people as a result of vaping-related lung illnesses which the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has attributed to the inclusion of vitamin E acetate in illegally obtained black market THC vapes.</p>
      <p>The ban has included the likes of PAX whose vaping app is a companion to the PAX3 vaping device, an <a href="https://www.pax.com/pages/regulatory">FCC compliant product</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement to news website <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-apple-to-remove-vaping-apps-from-store-8669fd94-e92a-4ce4-a9e2-ce5afa598b67.html"><u>AXIOS</u></a>, Apple stated it takes ‘great care to curate the App Store as a trusted place for consumers, particularly youth’.</p>
      <p>‘We’re constantly evaluating apps, and consulting the latest evidence, to determine risks to users’ health and well-being.’</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it appears that Dr Apple has identified the cause of the apparent ‘youth epidemic’ assigning blame to the ‘variety of lung injuries and fatalities to e-cigarette and vaping products’.</p>
      <p>‘These apps are no longer available to download.’</p>

      <p>According to Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, claimed that by taking e-cigarette related apps off the App Store ‘youth exposure to e-cigarette marketing’ will be reduced.</p>
      <p>‘Apple is setting a welcome example of corporate responsibility in protecting our kids.’</p>
      <p>Mr Myers, however, has mentioned nothing regarding alcohol-related apps on app stores, that in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114432/"><u>2013 study</u></a> found ‘an overall concern that these apps would be used as a form of entertainment, further encouraging young people to drink, rather than reduce their drinking and risk-taking’.</p>
      <p>The study, which also included the Google Play Store, concludes that ‘health departments and prominent health organisations need to endorse alcohol smartphone apps that are accurate and evidence-based to give specific apps credibility in the ever-expanding market of unregulated apps’.</p>
      <p>Prohibition and bans have never prevailed in the quest to educate and inform the population, especially the youth.</p>
      <p>You need only look to the US alcohol prohibition era for reference.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail UK had the perfect answer to the misinformation that has reached as far as Apple by placing a factually based response to ‘What is Killing Vapers?’.</p>

      <p>If Apple is reading this or has taken the time to read the facts elsewhere, reconsider the banning of vape-promoting apps from the App Store.</p>
      <p>A recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109719381938"><u>study</u></a> has even revealed ‘dramatic improvement in heart health after switching from smokes to vaping,’ which has also appeared in dual users.</p>
      <p>‘Tobacco cigarette (TC) smokers, particularly females, demonstrate significant improvement in vascular health within one month of switching from TC to e-cigarettes.’</p>
      <p>‘Switching from TC to e-cigarettes may be considered a harms reduction measure.’</p>
      <p>In response to the study, Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos M.D a cardiologist and research fellow at the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens-Greece had this to <a href="http://www.ecigarette-research.org/research/index.php/whats-new/2019/276-ecig-heart2?fbclid=IwAR2Y21JJMOjjojJm1peKPlAnWQXKP39heBSa9bbPfTU6zHsrOL2p40Tp244"><u>say</u></a>, ‘It is time for everyone to be more open-minded and look at the evidence away from predisposition and prejudice’.</p>
      <p>I agree, do you Apple? </p>
