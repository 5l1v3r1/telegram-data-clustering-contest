      <p>Winning a third straight game and further securing their spot in the AFC playoff chase has not prevented Jon Gruden and the Oakland Raiders from tinkering on a still evolving defense.The Raiders marked their three-game winning streak and their 6-4 record by signing veteran middle linebacker Preston Brown, who the winless Cincinnati Bengals cut this November in his first year of a three-year $16.5 million contract. Brown went through waivers unclaimed. However, the Raiders inked him after working him out during the weekend.</p>
      <p>Oakland hopes Brown can follow another former Bengals’ middle linebacker as a key piece to help the defense down the stretch. The Raiders have been in flux at the position since Vontaze Burfict, who was cut by Cincinnati in the offseason, Burfict, of course, was suspended for the final 12 games of this season after yet another on-field discipline issue.</p>
      <p>The Raiders have interest in re-signing Burfict, but Brown, 27, is two years younger than Burfict, so he will have a chance to audition for a 2020 job in the final stretch of this season. Because the Bengals run a similar defense to the Raiders, the hope is Brown will be able get extensive playing time soon.</p>
      <p>While he was not great for the struggling Bengals, Brown has produced in the past. Brown had 100-plus tackles in each of his first four NFL seasons with the Buffalo Bills.</p>
      <p>Thus, he is a welcome addition for the rest of the season at a reduced rate. Gruden is certainly happy to have another veteran on his growing defense.</p>
      <p>“Well, he’s 27 years old,” Gruden told reporters in Oakland on Monday in quotes distributed by the team. “We really liked him coming out of Louisville. He had three straight 100-tackle seasons as a Buffalo Bill, went to Cincinnati and obviously things didn’t work out, but he has the intangibles first of all that you look for in middle linebacker. He’s charismatic, he’s intelligent, physical guy, football junkie and he’s been productive in the league. We’ll put him in the room with [linebackers coach David] Lippincott and [defensive coordinator Paul] Guenther and see if he can get caught up quickly and we’ll try to fast track him.”</p>
      <p>The Raiders are used to quickly getting veteran defensive players ready to play this season. It’s what they do.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Raiders signed veteran safety D.J. Swearinger (after starter Karl Joseph went on the inured reserve with a foot injury) and defensive lineman Dion Jordan. Swearinger was on the street and Jordan, the No. 3 overall draft pick in 2013, just ended a 10-game NFL suspension. Both Swearinger and Jordan played extensively Sunday in Oakland’s win over Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>The same can be said for linebacker Will Compton, who was signed off the street a few weeks ago. Oakland also signed veteran defensive tackle Terrell McClain during the season.</p>
      <p>They’re all part of a work-in-progress unit built by Gruden and his top assistant, Raiders’ general manager, Mike Mayock.</p>
      <p>The Raiders defense will be tinkered again this offseason, but it does have some nice young pieces led by defensive end Maxx Crosby. The fourth-round draft pick had four sacks against the Bengals. With the youngsters thriving and these veteran moves, Gruden and Mayock hope it will be enough for the defense to supplement a strong Oakland offense as it makes its push toward the postseason.</p>
      <p>So, don’t be surprised if the Brown addition isn’t the last of its kind this season in Oakland.</p>
