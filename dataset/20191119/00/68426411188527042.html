      <p>Given the disorienting pace of the present-day news cycle, it’s forgivable if the 2014 “torture report” isn’t fresh on one’s mind. It was an ugly moment in U.S. political history that happened just a few years before the avalanche of ugliness became all too suffocating.</p>
      <p>The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence compiled the stomach-churning report into the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation techniques” (a fancy way of saying torture) on detainees during the “war on terror” era. It’s a stunning example of blatant disregard for moral code and values, which amounted to nothing more than a shameful stain. And while this story has the potential to be a head-of-a-pin-sized blip on the radar in our current dystopian news crawl, it’s since been given the cinematic treatment.</p>
      <p><i>The Report</i> is a breakneck film that reveals the massive undertaking and exasperating challenges faced when trying to hold a government agency accountable for atrocities it actively tried to hide. It stars Adam Driver as Dan Jones, a committee staffer who is given the task of uncovering what he can about the wrongdoings of the CIA.</p>
      <p>We learn off the top that prior to starting the report, Jones was seeing someone but had to end it since the work became too consuming. It’s the only hint of a backstory we get into his character – or any character – yet we don’t need much more. The performances are mostly what drive this film, which is otherwise drab in its presentation.</p>
      <p>Those yearning for aesthetic verve had better look elsewhere; much of <i>The Report</i> takes place inside cold, concrete government buildings. The occasional backdrop of mahogany wood panelling is the closest to warmth you’ll experience in two hours.</p>

      <p>Despite a cast consisting of dozens of similarly uniformed civil servants and politicians, including Jon Hamm as Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Michael C. Hall in a minor role as CIA lawyer Thomas Eastman, every player brings an urgency and presence to their performances.</p>
      <p>Major kudos to costume designer Susan Lyall, whose work manages to make a statement on the homogeneity of the staid bureaucrat ensemble. Annette Bening, who plays Dianne Feinstein, the unflappable senator from California who spearheaded the report, only wears a variation of the same outfit: a stiff suit with pearls or a stiff suit with a silk shawl. The only thing that changes is the colour of the fabrics.</p>
      <p>The film takes on a choppy foundation, jumping back and forth between time and location. It relies on a scratchy animated timeline to remind the viewer what year it is. One moment, we’re in the fluorescently lit windowless basement where Jones must toil away into near insanity; the next, we’re cast inside a dark cave-like torture chamber where a naked man is chained to the walls as heavy metal blasts from speakers.</p>
      <p>This velocity, along with the performances, helps turn a movie that’s essentially about a 6,700-page report (eventually boiled down to 525) into riveting storytelling.</p>
      <p>The Report <i>opens Nov. 22 at the </i><a href="http://tiff.net/"><i>TIFF Lightbox</i></a><i> in Toronto, and Nov. 29 on Amazon Prime Video</i></p>
