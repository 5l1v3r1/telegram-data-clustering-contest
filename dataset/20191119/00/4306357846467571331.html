      <h3>Manchester United are set to make an approach to sign Erling Haaland from Red Bull Salzburg in the January transfer window, according to reports.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3990703/sources-manchester-united-to-make-enquiry-over-haaland-availability-in-january">ESPN</a> is reporting that the Red Devils are looking into a possible move for the 19-year-old in the new year after his value reportedly sky-rocketed in recent months.</p>
      <p>Haaland has been in good form for Salzburg so far this season, scoring 26 goals for the Austrian side including 15 in 12 league games.</p>
      <p>The same story reports that Manchester United are set to make an enquiry in January amid fears that the forward’s price could increase further in the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>The teenager has scored seven goals in four Champions League appearances to make him the competition’s top scorer as things stand.</p>
      <p>The same article says that Haaland is already rated at more than £85m by his current employers.</p>
      <p>The story claims that Manchester United are willing to explore the possibility of signing Haaland on loan in January and sending him back to the Austrian club for the rest of the current campaign.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are likely to be linked with a host of players in January as they look to strengthen their squad at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
