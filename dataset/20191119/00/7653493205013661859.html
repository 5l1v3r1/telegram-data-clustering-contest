      <p>The House of Reps Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts is holding the first public hearing for its inquiry into the deployment, adoption and application of 5G in Australia today, in Southport on the Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>The inquiry was launched in September with very brief, but wide-ranging terms of reference: to investigate the capability, capacity and deployment of 5G; and to understand the application of 5G, including use cases for enterprise and government. Security issues are not included.</p>
      <p>The inquiry has received 213 submissions, the vast majority from individuals. Those examined by CDN were all concerned that 5G radiation could be harmful. So far no other public hearings have been scheduled.</p>
