      <p>A man of the cloth who had just finished a round of golf in Melbourne was dragged out of his car and had a gun pointed at his face before a thug stole his Subaru Impreza.</p>
      <p>Retired Uniting Church Reverend John Evans was driving on Old Poplar Road in Parkville on Monday about 8am, when a dark-coloured SUV blocked him in.</p>
      <p>He stopped his silver car, with registration 100 1DS, before a man got out of the passenger side of the SUV and opened Mr Evans' door.</p>
      <p>"That male has waved that handgun around and made demands for John to hand over his car," Detective Senior Constable Anthony Murphy told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mr Evans said his attacker was dressed like a police or border force officer, and he realised the gun was fake before the man fiddled with his seatbelt to drag him out.</p>
      <p>"I immediately saw the gun. He said 'get out, I have a gun'," Mr Evans told reporters.</p>
      <p>"You are looking down the barrel of a gun. There was no sense of metal that he was holding to my face. I wasn't fearful he was going to shoot me."</p>
      <p>The man pulled Mr Evans from his car, threw him on the ground while wielding a small black pistol.</p>
      <p>"I hit the deck but he aggressively was going for my pocket - he worked out where the keys were (it is a push start engine) and literally ripped my trousers to get to those."</p>
      <p>During the scuffle, the gun was knocked and skimmed across the road.</p>
      <p>"I didn't grab the gun, it flew out in the whole kerfuffle and ... it landed in the gutter," he said.</p>
      <p>The man jumped in Mr Evans' car and drove off, with a co-accused leaving in the SUV.</p>
      <p>Police have released a face-fit image of a southern European man with tanned skin, in his early 20s, wearing a black baseball cap they wish to speak to about the attack.</p>
