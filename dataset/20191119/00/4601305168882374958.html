      <h1>Save water (and money) with this smart home monitor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/boingboingstore" target="_blank">Boing Boing's Shop</a></address>
      <p>Between all of our apps, streaming devices, Bluetooth speakers, and energy-sucking decorations, paying for utilities each month can be...brutal. In fact, the average household spends <a href="https://www.creditdonkey.com/average-utility-bills.html">roughly $70 a month</a> on the water bill alone. That number might not seem terribly significant, but when you add it up, that's $840 a year — a pretty significant chunk of cheddar, and that's just for one of your many bills. Pair that with the fact that water conservation is becoming increasingly more important, (especially in areas susceptible to droughts) and being conscientious of your water use is, quite frankly, more important than ever.</p>
      <p>That's where Flume comes in. <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/flume-smart-home-water-monitor?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=flume-smart-home-water-monitor&amp;utm_term=scsf-351092&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MwwO&amp;scsonar=1">This easy-to-install smart water monitor</a> pops right onto your home's water meter and tracks your water use in real time. You can check in on your use through Flume's companion app directly from your smartphone, which constantly gathers and reports the data back to you.

Flume breaks down exactly where your water is going, so you can figure out how to cut back in areas where you're over-using it and save big on your monthly water bill. And, if you've already got a smart home or speaker setup, you can ask Alexa about your water status, use, and budget.</p>
