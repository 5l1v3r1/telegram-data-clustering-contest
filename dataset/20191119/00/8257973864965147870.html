      <h1>Oakland Raiders sign veteran LB Preston Brown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:08:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:08</time> by <a rel="author">Connor Grott</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Oakland-Raiders/?tps=1">Oakland Raiders</a> signed former <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Buffalo-Bills/?tps=1">Buffalo Bills</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cincinnati-Bengals/?tps=1">Cincinnati Bengals</a> linebacker Preston Brown, the team announced Monday.</p>
      <p>Brown has been a free agent since the Bengals released him last week. The defender was nine games into a three-year, $16.5 million contract that he signed with Cincinnati this past off-season.</p>
      <p>The Raiders, who are 6-4 and have won three consecutive games, believe Brown can make an impact in the team's 4-3 base defense. Oakland has been without middle linebacker <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Vontaze-Burfict/?tps=1">Vontaze Burfict</a>, who was suspended by the NFL for the remainder of the season after an illegal hit in Week 4.</p>
      <p>"He's 27 years old," Raiders head coach <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jon_Gruden/?tps=1">Jon Gruden</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Raiders/status/1196533741037899776">told reporters</a> Monday. "We really liked him coming out of Louisville. He had [four] straight 100-tackle seasons as a Buffalo Bill, went to Cincinnati and, obviously, things didn't work out.</p>
      <p>"But he has the intangibles, first of all, that you look for in a middle linebacker. He's charismatic, he's intelligent, a physical guy, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Walker/?tps=1">football</a> junkie and he's been productive in the league. We'll put him in the room with [linebackers coach David] Lippincot and [defensive coordinator Paul] Guenther and see if he can get caught up quickly and we'll try to fast-track him."</p>
      <p>The Bills originally selected Brown in the third round of the 2014 NFL Draft out of Louisville. He led the league with 144 total tackles in the 2017 campaign.</p>
      <p>In nine games (eight starts) with the Bengals this season, Brown recorded 54 total tackles, one forced fumble and a fumble recovery.</p>
      <p>The team <a href="https://twitter.com/Raiders/status/1196539785893965824">announced</a> that wide receiver and return specialist Dwayne Harris was placed on season-ending injured reserve in a corresponding roster move. He was limited to only three games due to ankle and foot injuries.</p>
      <p>The Raiders will visit the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Jets/?tps=1">New York Jets</a> (3-7) on Sunday before playing the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kansas-City-Chiefs/?tps=1">Kansas City Chiefs</a> on Dec. 1.</p>
