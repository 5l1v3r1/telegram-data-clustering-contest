      <p>Referring to its chosen fields, Israel Corp. stated that by 2030, global demand for food will grow by 35%, in correlation with the growing population. As life expectancy continues to rise, the company anticipates a growing demand for at-home medical treatment and healthcare services. <br/>The company also predicts that traditional industry will be changing and implementing industry 4.0 solutions, as skilled manual workers are becoming scarce and expensive, extreme weather conditions affect the supply chain, and cybersecurity threats are becoming more common.</p>
      <p>Controlled by Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer, Israel Corp. focuses mainly on energy and chemicals and holds significant stakes in Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) and oil refining company Bazan Group.</p>
