      <p><i>Businessman and family were away in Dharmasthala when the burglar struck</i> <br/><br/>Frustrated at not being able to open the locker in a house, and probably also wanting to destroy evidence that he was there, a thief set fire to a businessman’s house on the Hosur Main Road on Thursday night. The thief took a lamp from the pooja room in the house and used it to start the fire. <br/><br/>The thief also poured oil on silk sarees, furniture and other items before setting fire. The businessman Sampangi Rama Reddy and his family had gone to Dharmasthala at the time of the incident. Valuables worth a few lakh is said to have been gutted. <br/><br/>Reddy stays at Battalaunissa Layout on Hosur Road. On Thursday around 10.15 am, Reddy and his family locked up their house and left for Dharmasthala. As the family was at the temple, Reddy’s neighbour Manjunath called him and said that they could see smoke emanating from one of the rooms on the first floor.</p>
      <p>My friend called me to say that someone had gained entry into the house by breaking open the main doors and set fire to a room on the first floor.</p>
      <p>­–Sampangi Rama Reddy<br/><br/>“I immediately alerted my other friends and tenants to check what had happened as it would take time for us to return. We received the phone call in the night. After some time, one of my friends called me again and said that somebody had gained entry into the house by breaking open the main doors and set fire to a room on the first floor of the house. My friends had called the police and the fire force had doused the fire. We left immediately and reached our house on Friday morning.” <br/><br/>He said by the time they reached, the entire first floor of the building was gutted. “We found out that the accused had taken away the digital video recorder of the CCTV that was in the hall of the ground floor,” Reddy told Mirror. <br/><br/><b>Whole house was ransacked</b> <br/><br/>The accused had ransacked the entire house. He had taken away gold and silver ornaments worth around Rs 30,000.</p>

      <p>Then the accused went to the room on the first floor and seems to have tried to break open the lock on the safe. The air conditioner, water geyser, furniture, clothes, cot and silk sarees that were on the first floor were completely gutted. <br/><br/>Reddy filed a complaint with the jurisdictional police on Friday afternoon. <br/><br/>“The accused took a lamp from the pooja room and used it to set fire. We suspect that the accused was probably frustrated over not being able to open the lock. There is also a possibility that they set fire to destroy evidence like their finger prints. It appears that the accused is either a professional or known to the family of the victim. CCTV footage of the vicinity shows one person walking out from Reddy’s house which made us suspect that there could be only one person involved,” said an officer on part of investigations. <br/><br/>A case of house-breaking by night in order to commit theft (IPC 457), theft in house (IPC 380) and mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house (IPC 436) has been registered against the accused by the Bengaluru district police. <br/><br/>Further investigations are on.</p>
