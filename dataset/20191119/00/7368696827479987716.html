      <h1>Half-Life: Alyx Officially Announced – Valve Will Unveil it This Week</h1>

      <p>A few hours ago, at roughly 02:00 this morning (19 November) the official Valve Twitter account suddenly woke up and revealed that the developer’s next Half-Life game is their flagship VR title, Half-Life: Alyx. In October this year, we did <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/half-life-vr-title-could-be-the-next-game-from-valve-rumour/">report</a> that Valve’s next Half-Life game could be a flagship VR title and now, we know for sure.</p>

      <p>Finally, we will see a new Half-Life game from Valve and although a VR title is probably not what a lot of fans were hoping for, it is still quite exciting to know that something new is actually happening. You won’t have to wait long either, as Valve will reveal Half-Life: Alyx to the world this Thursday, 21 November at 20:00 SAST.</p>

      <p>At the time of writing, there are no more official details to share on the developer’s flagship Steam VR title. However, earlier leaks suggest that it will be a single-player, story-driven experience with 12-16 hours of gameplay, taking place in the 20-year period between the original and Half-Life 2.</p>
      <p>Further, a leaked transcript that surfaced just a few days ago point towards the following gameplay:</p>
      <blockquote>You can see their whole body respond to the situation. You know, panicking, dropping clips on the ground as they fumble their weapons ’cause a zombie’s in front of them, all these things, they’re just – it’s been really fun watching playtests.</blockquote>
      <p>It is also pretty clear from the title that you will play with Alex Vance. Lastly, if the leaks are correct (which seems very likely at this point), you should expect a release date in March 2020 for Half-Life: Alyx from Valve.</p>
