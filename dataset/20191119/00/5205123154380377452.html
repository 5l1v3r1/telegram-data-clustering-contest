      </p>
      <p>The All-Ireland Senior Champions had seven players on the All-Star selection for the second year-in-a-row.</p>
      <p>The three-in-a-row All-Ireland winners delivered in four of the six lines on the field, with Niamh Collins named at centre-half-back; Sinead Goldrick and Olwen Carey on the half-back line; Siobhan McGrath at midfield; while Carla Rowe, Niamh McEvoy and Lyndsay Davey formed an all-Dublin half-forward line.</p>
      <p>Beaten All-Ireland finalists Galway received four awards with back-to-back All-Stars for defender Sinéad Burke, and first-time accolades for twins Louise and Nicola Ward; and Galway captain Tracey Leonard.</p>
      <h3>Cork recognition</h3>
      <p>Cork claimed two awards with a second award for corner-forward Orla Finn, and a first-time accolade for 23-year old defender Melissa Duggan.</p>
      <p>Mayo's Rachel Kearns was also a first-time recipient at full-forward.</p>
      <p>Meath's Monica McGuirk was the only Intermediate Player included on the selection, and picked up her first All-Star, and Meath's first since 2011, when Irene Munnelly also was named as the All-Star goalkeeper.</p>

      <p>The 31-year old was delighted to receive the award, on a night which also saw her claim a fourth All-Star, having first been honoured with the personal accolade back in 2009.</p>
      <p>"It's just an absolute honour,” she told <i>The Irish Post.<br/></i><br/>“To just get an All-Star is an amazing achievement, and to obviously get voted by your peers is the ultimate goal and the ultimate achievement,” she said. “It tops off a great year for me, but also for the girls - just representing our Dublin team and what we are made of.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Tipperary's Aishling Maloney was named the Intermediate Players Player of the Year, with her Premier County colleague Orla O'Dwyer; and Meath's Monica McGuirk shortlisted. Eimear Smyth, from beaten finalists Fermanagh picked up the Junior award, with London's Hannah Noonan and Louth's Kate Flood also shortlisted.</p>
      <h3>Heffernan enters the Hall of Fame</h3>
      <p>Mayo's seven-time All-Star, and four-time All-Ireland Senior winner Christina Heffernan was also inducted into the Hall of Fame on the night.</p>
      <p>“I am delighted for both myself and my family,” Heffernan said.</p>
      <p>“It's a great honour to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, for doing something I loved doing all of those years ago playing and enjoy football.</p>
      <p>Christina's last All-Star came in 2003 – the first occasion that the All-Stars were held with a Gala banquet – she says it has come on a lot since.</p>
      <p>“When I got my first All-Star, we played the All-Ireland winning team in a match, and then the presentations were afterwards, but now it's on a bigger and wider scale, and rightly so.</p>
      <p>“It's not easy to win these awards, and the players deserve a big night like this, and a big occasion.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Provincial Young Players of the Year were also awarded, with Galway's Ellen Power; Ciara Smyth of Meath; Cork's Eimear O'Donovan; and Saoirse Kiernan of Cavan; picking up honours for Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster respectively.</p>
      <p>The All-Stars will be heading to Texas next March for the bi-annual tour, with a game between the 2018 and 2019 All-Stars forming the centre-piece of the trip.</p>
