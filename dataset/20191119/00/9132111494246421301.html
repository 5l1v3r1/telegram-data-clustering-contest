      <p>The Member of Parliament for Effiduasi/Asokore constituency in the Ashanti Region, Dr. Nana Ayew Afriye is robustly campaigning for a ‘Yes’ vote in the impending national referendum.</p>
      <p>According to him, a vote for ‘Yes’ will end the ‘winner-takes-all’ canker that creates rancor in Ghana’s politics.</p>
      <p>He wonders why the opposition National Democratic Congress [NDC] is against voting for ‘Yes’ after urging the electorates to massively vote for ‘Yes’ in the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>The referendum has become necessary because Article 55 is an entrenched provision of the Constitution and therefore can only be amended through a referendum.</p>
      <p>Article 55 (3) states that “subject to the provisions of this article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units.’’</p>
