      <h1>BREAKING: Sowore May Be Knocked Down By Vehicle If Released By Us, DSS Claims</h1>
      <h2>The secret police continues to hold on to Sowore despite two court orders directing it to release him after meeting bail conditions on both occasions.</h2>

      <p>In yet another ridiculous twist, the Department of State Services on Tuesday said that it was yet to release pro-democracy campaigner and Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, from its detention facility in Abuja because it doesn't want him to get knocked down by a vehicle on his way out. </p>
      <p>Spokesperson for the agency, Peter Afunanya, also told journalists in Abuja on Tuesday that Sowore's lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), was yet to come fetch him from their facility. </p>
      <p>Afunanya said, "We cannot just release Sowore and ask him to go because he may be knocked down by a vehicle at the gate."</p>
      <p>Afunanya noted that Falana had not been to the headquarters of the service since the activist was granted bail, a claim the popular rights lawyer vehemently rejects. </p>
      <p>Afunanya claimed that the DSS was following administrative procedures by asking the sureties to come forward for proper documentation. </p>

      <p>He said, "We respect rules and orders of the court and there was never a time the Director-General said he would not release Sowore."  See Also <a href="http://saharareporters.com/exclusive">Exclusive</a> <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2019/11/14/dss-doesnt-want-sowore-out-detention-alive-sources">DSS Doesn't Want Sowore Out Of Detention Alive -Sources</a> <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2019/11/14/dss-doesnt-want-sowore-out-detention-alive-sources#disqus_thread">0 Comments</a> 5 Days Ago</p>

      <p>Falana says DG of DSS, Yusuf Bichi, had stopped taking his calls.</p>
      <p>“I confirm that I have an official relationship with the DG of SSS. But since the commencement of the case of Sowore and Bakare, the DG has refused to pick my calls while I have since become a persona non grata in the office of the SSS,” Falana said.</p>

      <p>Sowore was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.  See Also <a href="http://saharareporters.com/free-speech">Free Speech</a> <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2019/11/17/sowore-stop-insulting-collective-intelligence-nigerians-falana-tells-dss">Sowore: Stop Insulting The Collective Intelligence Of Nigerians, Falana Tells DSS</a> <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2019/11/17/sowore-stop-insulting-collective-intelligence-nigerians-falana-tells-dss#disqus_thread">0 Comments</a> 2 Days Ago</p>
