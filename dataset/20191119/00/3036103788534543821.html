      <h1>Telkom getting hammered</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bloomberg" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>Telkom SA SOC Ltd. shares extended their slump in Johannesburg after its acquisition target, Cell C Pty Ltd., agreed to an extended roaming deal with rival MTN Group Ltd.</p>
      <p>Telkom stock has sunk to its lowest in almost a year and is down 17% in the past four days. The company said Nov. 15 it was in talks to buy Cell C and combine South Africa’s third and fourth-largest mobile-phone companies.</p>
      <p>Monday’s MTN-Cell C news “reduces visibility on Telkom’s offer,” Citigroup Inc. analysts including Dilya Ibragimova wrote in a note.</p>
      <p>“The timing of the announcement may signal that Cell C may not be entirely happy with the terms of Telkom’s offer,” the Citi analysts wrote.</p>
      <p>A consolidation in the South African market from four to three players is not Citi’s base case, they wrote.</p>
      <p>The news “definitely makes the potential acquisition by Telkom much more complicated as it further entrenches MTN’s reach over the Cell C user base, and forces Telkom to potentially pay a higher future price should there be an acquisition of Cell C, which is already a concern in the market as Telkom may not have the balance sheet capacity to take on the acquisition,” Lester Davids, an analyst at Johannesburg-based Unum Capital, said by email.</p>
      <p>Telkom dropped 2.1% Monday to the lowest since Nov. 26, 2018. Cell C’s 45% shareholder Blu Label Telecoms Ltd. jumped 8%. MTN fell 0.3%, while cross-town rival Vodacom Group Ltd. lost 1.5%.</p>
