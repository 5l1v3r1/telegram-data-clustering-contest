      <p>COLLEGE BASKETBALL</p>
      <p>Duke is back at No. 1, moving up a spot following a pair of victories last week.</p>
      <p>The Blue Devils can thank Evansville for the jump.</p>
      <p>Duke moved to No. 1 for the first time this season, receiving 52 first-place votes from a 65-member media panel in The Associated Press men’s college basketball poll released Monday.</p>
      <p>The Blue Devils climbed a spot after unranked Evansville pulled off the 2019-20 season’s biggest surprise so far by knocking off previous No. 1 Kentucky. Duke (4-0) crushed Central Arkansas 105-54 last Tuesday and beat Georgia State 74-63 Friday behind Tre Jones’ career-high 31 points.</p>

      <p>No. 2 Louisville received eight first-place votes and No. 3 Michigan State, the preseason No. 1, had four.</p>
      <p>Kansas and North Carolina rounded out the top five, with No. 7 Virginia receiving the final first-place vote, one spot behind Maryland.</p>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Notre Dame’s 12-year run in The Associated Press women’s college basketball poll is over.</p>
      <p>The Fighting Irish fell out of the AP Top 25 on Monday for the first time since the end of the 2006-07 season, stopping a streak of 234 consecutive weeks being ranked. It was the third longest active streak behind UConn’s (492) and Baylor’s (302).</p>

        <p>While the Irish dropped out of the rankings, Oregon remained No. 1. The Ducks received 27 of the 29 first-place votes.</p>
        <p>Baylor was second, receiving the other two first-place votes, followed by Stanford, Connecticut and South Carolina. The Gamecocks moved up one spot, switching places with No. 6 Texas A&amp;M.; Oregon State, Louisville, Maryland and Mississippi State round out the top 10.</p>
        <p>Muffet McGraw’s team lost at home to Tennessee and Michigan State this week, marking the first time since 2008 that Notre Dame dropped two consecutive games in South Bend, Indiana. Tennessee’s victory was the first time that a team other than UConn had beaten the Fighting Irish at home since 2012. The win helped the Lady Vols get ranked for the first time this year (No. 23). Tennessee owns the longest streak of being ranked, remaining in the AP Top 25 for 565 consecutive weeks before falling out in 2016.</p>
        <p>BASEBALL</p>
        <p>NEW YORK (AP)_- Derek Jeter is among 18 newcomers on the 2020 Hall of Fame ballot. He is likely to be an overwhelming choice to join former New York Yankees teammate Mariano Rivera in Cooperstown after the reliever last year became the first unanimous pick by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America.</p>
        <p>A 14-time All-Star shortstop and five-time World Series champion, Jeter hit .310 with 3,465 hits in 20 seasons and was the 1996 AL Rookie of the Year. He has been CEO of the Miami Marlins the past two seasons.</p>
        <p>Other newcomers announced Monday by the BBWAA include Cliff Lee, Josh Beckett, Jason Giambi, Paul Konerko, Rafael Furcal, Bobby Abreu and Alfonso Soriano.</p>
        <p>Holdovers include Curt Schilling, who received 60.9% last year, Roger Clemens (59.5%), Barry Bonds (59.1%) and Larry Walker (54.6%). Schilling rose from 51.2% in 2018. Walker, on the ballot for their 10th and final time this year, increased from 34.1% in 2018.</p>
        <p>Bonds and Clemens, whose candidacies have been tainted by allegations of steroids use, are both on for the eighth time. Clemens rose from 57.3% in 2018 and Bonds from 56.4%.</p>
        <p>Ballots are sent to more than 400 BBWAA members with at least 10 consecutive years in the organization, and a player must appear on at least 75 percent to gain election. Ballots must be mailed by Dec. 31, and results will be announced Jan. 21.</p>
        <p>Anyone elected will be inducted July 26 along with any selections by the Hall’s modern era committee, which meets and votes at San Diego on Dec. 8.</p>
        <p>Players remain on the ballot for up to 10 years, provided they receive at least 5 percent of the vote annually.</p>
        <p>HOCKEY</p>
        <p>TORONTO (AP) - Hayley Wickenheiser hasn’t had a lot of time to reflect.</p>
        <p>The Canadian women’s hockey star - a quadruple Olympic gold medalist and seven-time world champion - retired in January 2017 and enrolled in medical school.</p>
        <p>As if there wasn’t enough on her plate already, she then took on the role as assistant director of player development for the Toronto Maple Leafs in August 2018.</p>
        <p>Wickenheiser got a chance to look back at her standout playing career on Monday night.</p>
        <p>The 41-year-old was among six inductees enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame, joining three-time Stanley Cup winner Guy Carbonneau, offensive blue-line dynamo Sergei Zubov and Czech great Vaclav Nedomansky in the players’ category.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford and longtime Boston College coach Jerry York went into the hall as builders.</p>
        <p>Wickenheiser recounted sleeping in a closet for a week just so she could attend an all-boys hockey camp.</p>
        <p>She went on to play for boys’ teams in Calgary - there weren’t any for girls, and she’d tuck her hair under her helmet to avoid standing out - but still had to fight.</p>
