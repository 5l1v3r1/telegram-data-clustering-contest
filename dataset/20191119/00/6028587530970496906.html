      <h1>Does It Make Any Difference If The Wine Was Aged In Stainless Steel, Concrete, Wood, Or Egg Tank?</h1>

      <p>The short answer is: yes, it does make a difference what kind of container is used for ageing. The taste will be different.Winemaking has its fashions and trends, just like any other business. Some of the fashions and trends are maybe of the rather obscure kind. But if you look at it in detail, it can be both fascinating and very important for the character of the wine.</p>
      <p>What kind of container does the winemaker store (or age) the wine in before it is bottled? Most people might think of oak barrels or steel tanks but there is a plethora of choices for the winemaker.</p>
      <p>Stainless steel is probably the most popular tank. It is easy to maintain and clean. It lasts a long time. It is easy to keep at the correct temperature.</p>
      <p>But there are plenty of other options. Oak barrels, as I mentioned, although only <a href="https://www.bkwine.com/news/usa-is-the-biggest-importer-of-french-oak-barrels-but-the-chinese-imports-are-growing-fast/">a tiny fraction of the world’s wine production is aged in wooden casks</a>. A dozen or so years ago it became fashionable for winemakers to go back to concrete tanks. They had better “thermic inertia”. Then came a period when everyone wanted to try the egg-shaped (yes!) concrete tanks. They kept the lees in constant movement and contributed body, it was said. Currently, it is the ear of amphorae and clay jars, the “original” container for making wine, popular not least by the “natural” wine enthusiasts. And there are many more options, different materials, sizes, shapes…</p>
      <p>So, what difference does it make? Well, to really know the effect you would have to take one and the same wine and store it in different tanks and then blind taste it and see what difference there is. If any.</p>

      <p>This is exactly what Vincent Chansault, winemaker at Domaine Gayda in the Languedoc, decided to do. In 2018 he had enough wine from one of his best plots, and enough empty containers, or different “vessels”, to try it. He put the wine in nine different containers with the intention of keeping it there the normal time for this wine, two years.</p>
      <p>But the very best thing was that he decided to share the experiment with a few fortunate wine professionals. So, earlier this week ten tasters sat down in Paris together with Vincent to taste the nine different wines. Blind, of course. A rare and unique tasting that I would not have missed for anything.</p>
      <p>Just to make this very clear, it was the exact same wine that had first fermented in a big tank. When it had finished fermentation it was put in nine different containers (I’ll explain which ones below). The wine will stay there for two years, the normal time before bottling for this particular wine. So right now we are halfway in time to bottling. The grapes came from a single vineyard in the Roussillon (in the south of France) with schist soil. It is a plot that is mainly used for one of the best cuvées of Domaine Gayda, Le Chemin de Moscou. All syrah grapes.</p>

      <p>Of the nine wines – nine containers – I particularly liked four. Three were in the middle, and two were less interesting to me at this moment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>My four preferred wines (in no particular order):</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Container 1: </b>(The<b> </b>numbering is mine; it is not the order of the tasting.)</p>
      <p>Nice fruit on the nose, quite soft, possibly a hint of oak. On the palate also quite smooth, with good tannins, high acidity but still rounded off.</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>Oak barrel of 228 litres, third use</b>.</p>
      <p>The winemaker Vincent Chansault's comment: “It will bring a bit of complexity and spice to a blend.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 2:</b>
      </p>
      <p>More powerful, more fruit, dark berries, more intense on the nose. On the palate: also quite powerful, good structure, intense, long, a bit harsh with rough tannins.</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>Concrete egg of 1600 litres</b>, supposedly giving a lot of movement of the lees.</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “It allows for very low levels of sulphur, protection against oxidation is very good.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 3:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good ripe fruit, more developed, good balance. On the palate: a touch of butteriness (but not of the oaky kind), quite a lot of tannins, relatively light-weight structure. Nice fruit on the nose but a bit hard on the palate. (There were very different opinions on this wine.)</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>Stainless steel tank</b>. One of the most common containers. But one that is usually not used by the winemaker for this wine.</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “I usually don’t use stainless steel for these grapes, for this cuvée, I think mostly they need a different kind of ‘élevage’.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 4:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lots of fruit in this wine and lots of freshness. Very expressive. On the palate, it also had lots of nice fruit with tannins that were very present, perhaps a bit hard. Long. (This was quite similar to the wine in Flextank, see below.)</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>Terracotta egg of 700 litres</b>.</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “It’s a very porous container so prone to oxidation, difficult to use and quite expensive. Makes the wine mature quite rapidly. One has to be careful not to keep the wine for too long in it or it will become tired.”</p>

      <p>
        <b>The next three wines, not quite as nice, in my opinion, as the “preferred” ones:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 5:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good fruit, slightly aromatic. On the palate, quite a lot of tannin, a touch of bitterness, short finish.</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>“Jarres en grès”, a stoneware pot of 1000 l </b>(sometimes called sandstone) that is burned at a much higher temperature than terracotta and is very little porous, almost vitrified inside.</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “It gives less oxidation than a barrel. Gives wines with a lot of purity. The shape it has does not move the lees like egg tanks.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 6:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Discrete on the nose, slightly burned and spicy; gives me a feeling of oak. On the palate: quite hard and angular, dry tannins.</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>Oak barrel of 228 litres, second use</b>. It was curious to note that the three-year-old barrel gave more impression of oak than the one-year-old (this one). Maybe an effect of that each barrel has its own character?</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “The oak dominates on this. We will need a little dose of this together with others in a final assemblage.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 7:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lots of fruit, very fresh, a touch aromatic. On the palate: Quite full-bodied, good balance, good fruit balanced by good tannins, no hard edges. (It seems I liked this quite a lot, reading the comments. Compare to nr 4 above.)</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>Flextank PEHD of 1000 l</b>, a type of plastic tank designed to have the same porosity (oxygen transmission rate) as an oak barrel, to give the same effect of oxidation but without the wood aromas.</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “Interesting material. Also, quite cost-efficient since you can use it for much longer than an oak barrel.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>And then we have the two wines that I found least interesting:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 8:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good fresh fruit, but a bit restrained, not to say dull. On the palate, lots of fruit, quite strong a bit harsh tannins, a touch of menthol, short.</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>Oak barrel of 500 l</b> (sometimes called “demi-muid”), second use. A larger barrel gives less impact on the wine than the smaller ones.</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “It respects the fruit very well.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Container 9:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very discrete, closed. Where is it? On the palate, dense, compact, quite full-bodied but doesn’t give anything away, a bit hard. Difficult to characterise.</p>
      <p>The container was: <b>“Foudres” of 2000 l</b>, the big oak vats. This one was 5 years old but typically they are used for many years and does not really give any oak character after the first couple of years.</p>
      <p>The winemaker's comment: “<i>Foudres</i> give a very slow evolution.”</p>
      <p>So, same wine, nine different containers. It definitely makes a difference.</p>

      <p>The above comments are my own personal opinions and my personal ranking of the wines. In a tasting like this, it is often fascinating to see how people perceive wines in very different ways. Sometimes one has quite contrary opinions of a wine. There was also not any real consensus of what was best or not so good although on average most of the tasters seemed to gravitate towards similar wines.</p>
      <p>I should also underline that the point of this kind of an exercise is not really to select what is “best”. There is no “best”. The objective is rather to understand the differences. What can be good for one wine may be bad for another. It is a way for the winemaker better to understand the tools that he is working with.</p>
      <p>A few months ago they did the same tasting in London and the result was very different. This was partially due to that the wines were a few months younger, which makes a big difference when we’re talking about wines that have not yet reach one year of age. But another difference was, said the organisers, that the tasters in London seemed to prefer wines of a different style than the Paris tasters, more smoothness and more ripe fruit. There’s nothing surprising in this. There is not a single yardstick of what is a good wine. Everyone has his or her own yardstick for that.</p>
      <p>In reality, what will happen at Domaine Gayda, as in most other wineries, is that they will use different kinds of containers (vats, tanks, barrels…) that the will blend into the final wine. The wines we tasted will mostly go into Domaine Gayda Le Chemin de Moscou 2018 when they make the final blend in one year’s time. A strange name for a wine from the south of France, but it is actually the address of the winery.</p>
      <p>It will indeed be very interesting to taste the end result!</p>
