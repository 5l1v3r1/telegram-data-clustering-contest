      <h1>Tottenham Sack Mauricio Pochettino As Manager</h1>

      <p>Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur have announced that Mauricio Pochettino has been relieved of his duties and will leave immediately.</p>
      <p>Chairman Daniel Levy confirmed the news today.</p>
      <p>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing," he said.</p>
      <blockquote>It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.<br/>Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</blockquote>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
      <p>The club are currently 14th in the Premier League, 11 points off the top four.</p>
      <p>Pochettino joined Spurs in 2014 on a five-year contract. In 2018, he had signed another five-year deal but recent form has been poor. During his term, the club reached a Champions League final and he became the first Tottenham boss to win 100 Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>It was also confirmed that Pochettino's coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez will also leave.</p>
