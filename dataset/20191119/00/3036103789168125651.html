      <h1>What you need to know about Slush 2019 – The world’s largest startup-tech event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/carien-pretorius" target="_blank">Carien Pretorius</a></address>
      <p>The world’s leading startup and tech event <b><a href="https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/#/">Slush</a></b> is just around the corner, and will take place in Helsinki, Finland on 21-22 November.</p>
      <p>The event brings together 25,000 curious minds, including 4,000 startups and 2,000 investors, at the Helsinki Expo and Convention Centre – with the aim of building a worldwide startup community.</p>
      <p>Slush is a student-driven, not-for-profit movement which is organised by over 2,000 volunteers and was founded to change attitudes toward entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Today, it provides delegates with the ideal platform to meet and discuss opportunities through events such as matchmaking, pitching competitions, and exhibitions.</p>
      <p>The line-up for the two-day event includes highly-acclaimed speakers from companies such as Stripe, Giphy, and Masterclass who are experts in their fields.</p>
      <h3>The foundation</h3>
      <p>According to Slush, what started as a gathering of 300 local founders in 2008 has become a community of truly global magnitude.</p>
      <p>The mission of Slush remains the same, however: to create and help catapult the next generation of ground-breaking entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>Slush also hosts smaller gatherings from Singapore to New York, and other large events in Finland, Japan, and China – all in the name of uniting tech communities to solve the most meaningful problems of our time.</p>
      <p>With only two days to go until the main event, investors and start-ups from all over the world – including from Southern Africa – have already started connecting through side events which have been organised for the week leading up to Slush.</p>
