        <b>With votes from opposition deputies, Riga City Council’s Vice-Chairman Vadims Baraņņiks was removed from his post on Tuesday, 19 November. He was also removed from his post in Riga Freeport board.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of <i>Harmony</i> and <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i>, as well as all opposition members, voted in favour of Baraņņiks’ dismissal. A total of 40 votes were cast in favour of his dismissal.</p>
      <p>Six independent deputies abstained in the vote.</p>
      <h3>According to representatives of the opposition, they supported Baraņņiks’ dismissal because «he was not fit for the post of vice-mayor».</h3>
      <p>At the same time, the opposition’s plan is organizing three consecutive extraordinary meetings without taking part in them thereby creating a precedent for dismissal of the city council.</p>
      <p>Legally a city council may be dismissed if no quorum is secured in three consecutive meetings. If deputies start making decisions about topics on the agenda and it is not possible to make any because of no quorum, the meeting is still considered to have happened. Quorum in Riga City Council is 31 deputies.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Baraņņiks’ dismissal as vice-mayor, he was also dismissed from his post in Riga Freeport board.</p>
      <p>Baraņņiks’ dismissal and termination of cooperation with <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i> was one of the conditions set by <i>Harmony</i> to <i>Honour to Service Riga</i> for the party’s continued work in the coalition.</p>

          <b>Harmony halts work in Riga City Council coalition until GKR makes up its mind</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>According to <i>Harmony</i>’s representative, it is not possible to cooperate with the <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>. <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> shares this belief. The independent deputies, meanwhile, say they are just «inconvenient» for the coalition.</p>
      <p>With termination of cooperation with the <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>, the coalition is left with 28 deputies.</p>
