        <b>Manchester United are heading in the right direction according to Scott McTominay, who has challenged his team-mates to step up.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/s-mctominay-289788/">Scott McTominay</a> believes <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> <b>will return from the international break </b>heading in the right direction after an initially difficult start to the season.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's future was the subject of significant scrutiny as United won just two of their opening nine Premier League games. However,<b> his side have emerged victorious in two of their last three league matches, </b>with 3-1 wins over Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion sandwiched by a defeat at Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>United are seventh in the table,<b> nine points adrift of Manchester City in fourth</b>, but they are through to the EFL Cup quarter-finals and are all but certain of a place in the knockout rounds of the Europa League, which provides the Red Devils with another potential route to next season's Champions League. A trip to Sheffield United, who are a point above Solskjaer's men, awaits on Sunday, <b>with McTominay upbeat ahead of a challenging fixture</b>.</p>
      <p>"In terms of the team, I feel we're much, much brighter," McTominay told United's official website. "The signs are good, <b>the signs are positive and we've talked about things</b> that we can improve on and how we're going to try to improve by the end of the season, which is the business end of the season as well.</p>

      <p>"We always have meetings [to discuss formations and tactics], that's normal. It's a normal thing to have meetings and for everybody to discuss, that's a normal thing and the sign of a healthy dressing room.<b> Boys speaking among it in the changing room</b>, saying what they think we can improve on and what are good ideas as well. There's plenty going on, it's not a place to be quiet and in your shell. <b>It's time for people to really step up</b> and start doing their jobs as well."</p>
      <p>McTominay, <b>who suffered an ankle injury against Brighton</b>, pointed to the return of Anthony Martial, who has scored three goals in his last six games in all competitions, as a reason for positivity. He added: "It's difficult to say but with the injuries we've had, I do think we've coped relatively well with a small squad and a lot of boys playing a lot of minutes in a short space of time.<b> I think people forget that we have had a lot of injuries</b>, and you can see with Anthony coming back what a difference he makes. </p>
      <p>"There are very positive signs and things are changing. Everybody is looking forward to the next game and wanting that next game to come as soon as possible. <b>Everybody wants to play and that’s the sign of a healthy dressing room</b>."</p>
