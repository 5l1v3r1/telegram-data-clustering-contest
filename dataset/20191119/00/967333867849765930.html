        <b>Burger King's Impossible Whopper, which quickly became the fast-food chain's most successful launch and has been positively received by vegans and vegetarians alike, will see the release of three more sandwiches using the plant-based patties in 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A group of vegans launched a lawsuit <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201904021073746154-australian-mcdonalds-unveils-pickles-burger/">against Burger King</a> for an alleged blunder by the fast food company in their manufacture of their new Impossible Whopper, according to Fox News on Monday.</p>
      <p>The suit was launched by Phillip Williams over allegations that the restaurant's cooking methods use the same equipment to cook the vegetarian burger that is used for the meat-based burgers.</p>
      <p>Williams, a self-described vegan, claimed that the plant-based Impossible Whopper is contaminated by meat byproducts due to the practice of cooking it on the same grill as beef sandwiches, TMZ reported.</p>
      <p>According to Williams, a consistent customer of the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201612291049112708-burger-king-name-spain/">vegan Whopper</a> in Atlanta, Georgia, vegans are outraged by any practice which leads to the meat contamination of a vegetarian burger.</p>
      <p>Some Twitter users accused "whiny protestors" of attempting to stop the production of the Impossible Whopper.</p>

      <p>Others suggested that it was inconsistent for vegetarians to demand food options and then to sue the chain.</p>

      <p>Some asked why a vegan would  want to eat at a Burger King.</p>

      <p>Burger King has <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905201075163385-burger-king-milkshake-farage/">warned customers</a> that the 'vegan' label does not carry over into how the burger is cooked, in this case, an "open kitchen environment". The fast-food company noted that customers can request their burgers be cooked in an oven, separate from meat-based products.</p>
      <p>Burger King previously <a href="https://www.plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/impossible-whopper-burger-kings-most-successful-launches">faced a backlash</a> after customers noted that they had been served beef patties instead of the vegetarian impossible burger.</p>
