      <p>EastEnders spoilers have teased Lisa Fowler will set out to avenge the death of her best friend Mel Owen, as she's disbelieved over her claims.</p>
      <p>Lisa dropped the bombshell on Phil Mitchell last week that he wasn't the father of his wife Sharon's unborn baby.</p>
      <p>Mel had told Lisa shortly before her death about Sharon having an affair - while she didn't tell her who the father was.</p>
      <p>Viewers know that Keanu Taylor is the father of her unborn baby, with Mel blackmailing the pair over their secret right up until her death.</p>

      <p>Next week, as it's revealed Phil disbelieves ex Lisa's claims about the baby, she sets out to avenge Mel.</p>
      <p>Lisa is determined to expose Sharon's baby secret to her family, blaming this over Mel's tragic demise.</p>
      <p>Mel was in a car chase with Sharon, both heading for the airport to get to Phil first - Mel wanted to tell him about the baby, with Sharon keen to silence her.</p>

      <p>But Mel crashed her car, with Sharon managing to save her only for her to walk into the path of an incoming lorry.</p>
      <p>Lisa accused Sharon of murder working out where they were headed and what the chase was about.</p>
      <p>But Lisa, who has a history of battling mental illness, leaves her pregnant daughter Louise concerned fearing she is off her medication.</p>

      <p>Sharon is left feeling guilty when Louise's fiancé Keanu heads round there and admits her concerns over Lisa being unwell again.</p>
      <p>The pressure is on for the former lovers, as they remain desperate to hide their affair and baby secret knowing full well it's making Lisa appear unwell in the process.</p>
      <p>Will one of them be forced to admit the truth, and what will it mean for Lisa?</p>
      <p>Viewers will have to tune in to see how far the character will go to expose the truth for Mel and for her own sake.</p>
