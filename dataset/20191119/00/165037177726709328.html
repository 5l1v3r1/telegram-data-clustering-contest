        <b>Haaland's dad and agent was spotted at Carrington, Manchester United's training ground.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Alf-Inge Haaland knows Ole Gunna Solskjaer well</b>. Both played together for Norway in the 90s and have kept a good relationship from Erling's time at Molde.</p>
      <p>The Salzburg starlet played under the Manchester United boss in Norway and rumours of a move to the Red Devils have only increased in the last few days.</p>
      <p>'The Athletic' assures that <b>Alf-Inge, Erling's dad and agent visited Solskjaer at Carrington</b>, Manchester United's training ground, but this isn't the only thing that would make you think that a possible United approach is on the cards.</p>

      <p>The 'Daily Mail' backs up the aforementioned source and assures that <b>Solskjaer sent his trusted scout, Simon Wells</b>, to watch the player perform live.</p>
      <p>You have to remember that<b> Erling Haaland made his Molde first-team debut under Solskjaer </b>when the United boss hadn't even arrived at Old Trafford yet.</p>
      <p>The young striker who is performing excellently this season admitted a few weeks ago that he would love to try English football: "Every player dreams of playing for the best teams in the world. It has been a dream during my whole life and <b>I especially like English football</b>".</p>
      <p>Few people also know that Haaland was actually born in England, so he has dual nationality. The striker was born in Leeds when his father was playing at Elland Road in 2000. A reason to think that he is more likely to sign for a Premier League team than any other league.</p>
