      <p>MADRID (AP) - Luis Enrique is returning as Spain coach five months after stepping down because of his daughter’s illness.</p>
      <p>He is taking over from former assistant <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Robert Moreno</a>, who coached the team through qualifying for the 2020 European Championship. His last match was on Monday, a 5-0 rout of Romania in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique’s 9-year-old daughter, Xana, died of a type of bone cancer less than three months ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Moreno</a> had said he “would be delighted to step aside” if Luis Enrique decided to return and was ready.</p>
      <p>Federation president Luis Rubiales said it was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Moreno</a> who told officials he would leave after talking to Luis Enrique and being told by the former Barcelona coach that he would like to come back.</p>

      <p>Rubiales said it was always clear that Luis Enrique would return as coach when he felt he was ready.</p>
      <p>“Luis Enrique was always the leader of this project,” Rubiales said. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Moreno</a> would remain as the national team coach if Luis Enrique didn’t want to return.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Moreno</a> will no longer work as an assistant coach to Luis Enrique.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old Luis Enrique resigned from the national team in June, a few months after Xana was diagnosed. He had tried to remain in charge while staying with his family, making decisions and watching practices while being away.</p>

        <p>Spain ended its qualifying campaign as the Group F winner with eight wins and two draws. “La Roja” finished five points in front of second-placed Sweden. It will be one of the top seeded teams for next month’s Euro 2020 draw.</p>
        <p>Spanish media said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Moreno</a> said goodbye to players after the match against Romania at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium. He did not show up to speak to the media in the post-match news conference.</p>
        <p>He also did not show up for a meeting with federation officials on Tuesday morning to discuss details of his departure.</p>
        <p>The 42-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Moreno</a> officially took over ahead of the team’s 2-1 win at Romania in Euro 2020 qualifying. He coached five other matches, with three wins and two draws.</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-moreno/">Robert</a>’s performance as our coach was very good, we have to respect that,” Rubiales said. “We thank him for all the effort that he put in.”</p>
