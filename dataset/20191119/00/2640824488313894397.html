      <p>located on the west bank of the xiangjiang river, a new landmark opened in the city of changsha, <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/chinese-architecture/">china</a> at the end of september 2019. the hunan art <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/museums-galleries/">museum</a> is the largest public art center in the hunan province, combining awe-inspiring architecture with diverse cultural exhibitions. built by the huajian group, the multi-dimensional complex reflects the unique culture and bold vitality of its home, from its folded form through to its stimulating work within. <b>its special character is instantly recognizable by its intricate yet rich terracotta-cladded façade from <a href="https://www.lopochina.com/">LOPO China</a></b>, which intrigues with highly textured and transitional colors.</p>

      <p>hunan art museum’s unique form was conceptualized by huajian group as continuous horizontal fold lines that merge and morph into an enclosed building complex. a white block rises out from atop of the immensely red structure. <b>it adorns white <a href="https://www.lopochina.com/terracotta-panel.html">terracotta panels</a> by <a href="https://www.lopochina.com/">LOPO China</a></b>, where each tile was accurately cut, varied in shapes and sizes, before being directly drilled and fixed to the façade. from afar, its design mirrors that of a vertically folded, traditional chinese calligraphy paper. however, at a closer look, it features a texture like that of cracked chinese glazed ceramics. at night, bright lights shine through the gaps to make the block appear as if a lantern – or cultural beacon – within hunan.</p>

      <p>beneath, <b>the main body of the building adorns a façade of three custom-made glazed <a href="https://www.lopochina.com/terracotta-cladding.html">terracotta cladding</a> by <a href="https://www.lopochina.com/">LOPO China</a></b>. all varied in shapes and sizes, the trio of terracotta products adds a complex, seemingly irregular and highly textured character to the solid structure of the museum. trapezoidal panels horizontally line the façade with a transverse texture; triangular plates are fitted vertically to embellish the form; and a number of slightly smaller trapezoidal <a href="https://www.lopochina.com/Terracotta-Baguette-Terracotta-Louver.html">terracotta baguettes</a> are subtly fixed in front of the glass curtain wall on the first floor of the building.</p>

      <p>although seemingly bold in color, <b>LOPO’s vermilion-colored <a href="https://www.lopochina.com/terracotta-cladding.html">architectural terracotta products</a> offer a sophisticated subtlety.</b> working with light and shadow, the façade’s panels transition across a spectrum of red tones as light changes. the stunning effect causes the building to transform throughout the day, often unique in behavior on a day-to-day basis. its rough, powerful texture intertwines with the softness of the white facade that sits atop the building. the terracotta cladding composes a perfect balance to the hunan art museum’s multi-dimensionality.</p>
