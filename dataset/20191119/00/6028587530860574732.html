      <p>2019 has been a landmark year for Funko. Not only has the pop-culture collectible company, founded in 1998, celebrated its 21st anniversary, but they’ve thrown open the doors on a new brick-and-mortar proposition, a store on the iconic Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.“We decided on a second location for the customer experience and to help build the brand through the customer’s eyes,” explained Molly Hartney, Funko’s Chief Marketing Officer. “We wanted to double our footprint with the Los Angeles store, and this location is 40,000 feet. We wanted to do that in a location that could be considered the mecca of entertainment, and that is Hollywood.”</p>
      <p>They achieved it. The Hollywood location has more than twice the footprint of their 17,000-foot flagship store in downtown Everett, Washington, near the company’s headquarters.</p>
      <p>“Additionally, it is actually very nice that all of our studio partners are in the vicinity. Our licensing team and other elements of the business are also in Hollywood,” she added.</p>
      <p>And Hollywood is the perfect place to be with the first Funko movie already in the pipeline. Earlier in the year, it was confirmed that Warner Bros. had optioned the motion picture rights to the company’s collectible Pop! IP, which debuted in 2011, to produce and develop the first-ever animated film featuring the brand’s pop-culture figures – which include several Warner IPs including <i>Harry Potter</i>’s Wizarding World and the DCU.</p>
      <p>Both of those are among the IPs that have their own space in the Los Angeles store. The retail space is arranged in individual hubs that also include other multi-billion dollar cinematic entities such as <i>Star Wars</i>, Disney animation, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as anime properties, sports, music, and gaming entities such as <i>Fortnite</i>. There’s even an area dedicated to popular, and lucrative, horror franchises and iconic fear figures. Interestingly, the store also has a VIP area hidden behind a TARDIS and will be offering exclusives and special events.</p>
      <p>The idea for the store came from immersing the Funko fans and customers in the brand in a way they can’t experience in other retail environments, physical or online.</p>
      <p>“Throughout the store, there are various sets because we wanted to bring each fandom to life,” Hartney explained. “This is definitely more than purely a brick and mortar retail store. </p>
      <p>“The Hollywood store is truly where all fandoms can exist in the Funko world and bring it more to life than purely being a transaction. It’s a customer experience. It’s a testament to the Funko belief that everyone is a fan of something. We want to see how they celebrate that fandom; it’s something that people can celebrate. The lighting in the store is actually strategically placed for customers to get the best selfie,” she explained. It’s worth noting that the entire store has a slew of photo ops as well as easter eggs for the hardcore Funko fan.</p>

      <p>Like many who dream of making it in Hollywood, Funko realize that the road to success isn’t always smooth. When they listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in November 2017, the company’s public offering hit a significant bump in the road. When you’re a company whose heartbeat relies on pop culture and the buzzworthiness of IPs, changing tastes or any over-extension of the brand can be your Achilles heel.</p>
      <p>So, how does Funko navigate, and hopefully avoid, those hazards?</p>
      <p>“We do that by looking at various segmentation strategies by channel,” Hartney affirmed. “We also look at what is that space that we’re going out with, and we go deep in some things that make sense, such as an evergreen property. A great example of that is <i>Harry Potter</i>. We also then do the buzzworthy ones where we have a deep knowledge of who our consumer is. We want to have a part with a certain core audience and then bring out another flash for something else. The aim is for us always to have a presence. If we don’t have a presence, then the brand can’t live on.”</p>
      <p>“We truly consider that everyone is a fan of something, and we look at the white spaces out there and understand what people love and where sentiment lies. We do look for those buzzy moments in entertainment, and we have to be on that quickly. Who is worthy of a Funko right now? What about in the future? That, for us, is fascinating and fun at the same time.”</p>
      <p>Right now, things are great. The company’s third-quarter results for 2019 showed an increase in net sales of 26% to $223.3 million, gross profit increased 26% to $85.5 million, and income from operations increased by 36% to $22.6 million.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Thursday, October 31, 2019, Brian Mariotti, Funko’s CEO, said: “Funko once again delivered another quarter of strong growth and financial performance. We are driving results by executing against our strategic initiatives and investing in the long-term success of Funko.”</p>
      <p>“More and more people are choosing Funko to be the platform on which they engage with pop culture. We are focused on finding new and innovative ways to connect people to their favorite entertainment through fan experiences as well as digital and physical goods.”  </p>
      <p>He added: “There continues to be a strong global demand for our products as the proliferation of content persists around the world. We are continuing to make the investments needed to capitalize on our expanding growth opportunities in both new and existing markets.”</p>
      <p>The Hollywood store and the Warner Bros. film deal are great examples of Funko capitalizing on their success. And with that global appeal, could we see more Funko stores opening up in other key global markets such as Asia or Europe? </p>
      <p>“At this time, it really is about looking at how this one performs,” mused Hartney. “It’s also about what we get out of it from a branding and customer lens to understand the various expansion opportunities in the future, whether that be in the US or internationally.”</p>
      <p>“We’re not thinking too much about that right now. However, I will say that we do have another office located in London, and we do have our animation studio in Bath in the UK too.”   </p>
