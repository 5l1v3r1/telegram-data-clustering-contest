      <p>Health Minister, Mr Kwaku Agyemang-Manu has tongue-lashed the National Democratic Congress (NDC) among other pressure groups over claims that the parked ambulances sitting in front of the State House are to gain political favours from Ghanaians in the 2020 general elections.</p>
      <p>According to the minister, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) does not need to share ambulances during an election year to have a political advantage over their rivals, indicating that, pickups are mostly used for campaigns during an election year.</p>
      <p>Citing a vivid point to buttress his claim, Mr Agyemang Manu stated that President Akufo-Addo won 2016 elections without distributing ambulances for Ghanaians perusal.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Daniel Dadzie on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show, the minister said, “…we don’t use ambulances for elections, we rather use pickups. But Nana Akufo-Addo won massive elections in this country without showcasing any ambulances. His goodwill is still there. He doesn’t need that to win the campaign with”.</p>
      <p>Mr Agyemang-Manu noted that the parked ambulances need technical inspection to become fully operational. He stressed the importance of government working within the stipulated schedule to get the ambulances working without facing challenges.</p>
      <p>The ambulances, the Health Minister noted will fix the inefficiencies and weak systems in the health sector.</p>
      <p>In September 2019, President Nana Akufo-Addo announced the arrival of the first batch of ambulances for all 275 constituencies in the country.</p>
      <p>The buses, numbering 48 are part of the fulfilment of a promise made by President Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP Government in the build-up to the 2016 general elections.</p>
      <p>Currently, there are about 48 more awaiting to be cleared at the ports.</p>
      <p>President Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP promised all 275 constituencies and one ambulance per constituency.</p>
      <p>The NPP also promised to revamp the ailing National Ambulance Service, which as of 2018 had only about 55 ambulances working across the country.</p>
