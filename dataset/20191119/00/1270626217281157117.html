      <p>Permanent Secretary for Immigration, Yogesh Karan has confirmed Fijian citizens living overseas wanting new e-passports will have to wait or come to Fiji if they are to renew their e-passport.</p>
      <p>Karan says they will be installing the same equipment that they have in various centres in the country in all of their diplomatic missions in the world.</p>
      <p>Karan says this will be launched in London in two weeks time.</p>
      <p>He says once this is done, people overseas will be able to renew their e-passports or apply for a new one at their centres.</p>
      <p>Karan confirmed this after a Fijian citizen from Australia contacted us saying that she was told by the Fijian High Commission that she will have to come to Fiji to renew her e-passport.</p>
      <p>He says the government will announce the dates for each mission later this week.</p>
