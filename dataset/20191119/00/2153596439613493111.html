      <h1>Gupta Saxonwold home sold at auction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>A Gupta-owned property in Saxonwold has been sold at auction for R2.6 million.</p>
      <p>The house – famed for being the temporary residence of Ace Magashule’s son – is the first of several properties belonging to Gupta-owned Confident Concepts up for auction. The company is in business rescue.</p>
      <p>The Gupta family has a well-documented history in South Africa, particularly their close ties with former president, Jacob Zuma.</p>
      <p>The family has since fled the country following accusations that it used its political influence to interfere in ministerial appointments to advance their business interests as part of a campaign to “capture the state”.</p>
      <p>The 1,119 sqm luxury home comprises an entrance foyer, a lounge, a TV room, a dining room, a kitchen, three bedrooms and two bedrooms (one of which is en-suite), said auctioneer, Park Village Auctions.</p>
      <p>A covered patio gives access to a front garden and swimming pool. The property further features a double garage, and a single bedroom and bathroom staff quarter, it said.</p>
      <p>The property was sold by Park Village Auctions and GoIndustry DoveBid which have been jointly appointed by the business rescue practitioners.</p>
      <p>“We see the sale as an indication of what to expect with the remaining Gupta properties. Justice will out for the creditors awaiting payment albeit slow as a result of the delicate nature of the matter.</p>
      <p>“Transparency and following the law to-the-letter are paramount, and we believe this property signals a turning point in the saga. The wheel has started to turn, and we await instructions from the business rescue practitioners for the remaining properties,” said Clive Lazarus, PVA’s head auctioneer.</p>
      <p>The sale is subject to confirmation by the business rescue practitioners who will accept or reject the offer.</p>
      <p>Lazarus speculated that the offer will be accepted, as the price of R2,600,000 ex vat is satisfactory. “All things considered, we believe that is a fair price for both the buyer and seller,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said that an additional three properties in Saxonwold are set to be sold, along with a house in Constantia, Cape Town, and another in Umhlanga Rocks, Durban.</p>
      <p>The Gupta’s Optimum coal mine will also be brought to market, he said.</p>
