      <p>Security at the Asia Pacific Summit, 2019 escorted out Indian politician Vijay Jolly after he angrily tried to interrupt the speech by National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Suri was speaking about Kashmiris’ right to self-determination at the summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia when an enraged Jolly — a leader of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got up from his seat and walked in front of the hall saying, “I want to protest.”</p>
      <p>The deputy speaker, in his speech, said: “I want to direct your attention towards the human rights violations in Indian-occupied Kashmir. Almost 100,000 Kashmiris have been martyred and thousands are missing.</p>
      <p>“More than 11,000 women have been raped. More than 8,000 unmarked graves have been found  affected by Indian atrocities.”</p>
