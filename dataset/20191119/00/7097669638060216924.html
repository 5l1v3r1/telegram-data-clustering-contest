      <h1>Tillerson says Trump actions 'wrong' if proven</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:05:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Washington (AFP) - Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson has criticized alleged actions that have triggered an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, saying using US influence for personal gain is "wrong."</p>
      <p>Tillerson, a former oil executive who was unceremoniously fired by Trump in March last year, was asked about the scandal in an interview with the PBS Newshour broadcast Monday.</p>
      <p>Without using Trump's name or going into details of the incident, Tillerson said: "Clearly, asking for personal favors and using United States assets as collateral is wrong."</p>
      <p>"So if you're seeking some personal gain and you're using, whether it's American foreign aid, American weapons or American influence, that's wrong, and I think everyone understands that," he said.</p>
      <p>House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump over allegations that he held up military aid to press Ukraine to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing and accused the Democrats of waging a witch-hunt against him.</p>
      <p>The alleged "quid pro quo" occurred well after Tillerson was dismissed by Trump via Twitter.</p>
      <p>Tillerson has since offered critical views on Trump, including saying last year that he was obliged to stop the tycoon turned president from taking actions that were illegal.</p>
      <p>Trump has voiced anger in response and described Tillerson as "dumb as a rock."</p>
