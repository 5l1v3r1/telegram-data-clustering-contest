        <b>Swedish investigative journalists, who are looking into suspicions of money laundering, have submitted to the pan-Baltic banking group SEB a list with 194 people, the company has announced.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swedish parent company SEB wrote in a <a href="https://sebgroup.com/press/press-releases/2019/seb-comments-regarding-material-from-sveriges-television">press release</a> on Tuesday, November 19, that it has received a list of 194 corporate names from Sveriges Television’s program Uppdrag granskning.</p>
      <p>A majority of the names on the list are historical customer relations from Estonia. In 2006, SEB Estonia received criticism and recommendations from the Estonian financial supervisory authority for its handling of non-resident customers, SEB wrote. At the same time, SEB received information from an external whistle-blower. Both of these events resulted in that SEB Estonia strengthened its routines, reported a number of clients to the finance police and terminated several customer relations, the company explained.</p>
