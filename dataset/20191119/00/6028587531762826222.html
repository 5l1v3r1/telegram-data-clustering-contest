      <p><b><i>By Tricia Manning-Smith, SAP</i></b>The needle is so tiny, you almost have to hold it up to the light to see it. It’s the size of three hairs held together. This miniscule needle, and its supporting medical technology, might change the future for many chronic disease patients.</p>
      <p>Yet, because the needle is hidden inside an unprecedented med-tech device, patients will never actually see it. A patient will stick the yo-yo sized device on her abdomen and the needle stays hidden inside. She then simply pushes a button to self-administer her medication.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing like it in the world,” said Tim Flaherty, CFO and spokesman for Enable Injections. He explains that the startup company’s device is currently undergoing clinical trials before attaining the final FDA approval. </p>
      <p>Flaherty shows the device to visitor Megan Starshak, a chronic disease sufferer, as they tour the company’s Cincinnati, Ohio-based research and production facility. “The device doesn’t feel clinical and scary,” said Starshak. She knows a great deal about needles and pain.</p>
      <p>When Starshak was 18, a doctor diagnosed her with the chronic autoimmune disease, Ulcerative Colitis (similar to Crohn’s Disease). Since then, Megan has tried every treatment available to ease her symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, urgent bowel movements and abdominal pain.</p>
      <p>“My highest pill count per day was 28,” said Starshak who now visits a clinic for a nurse-administered IV that injects medication directly into her veins. "At the time, the IV was my last option to avoid surgery.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Growing need</b>
      </p>
      <p>Starshak  is one of 57 million people in the US expected to live with a chronic disease by 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/2_background/en/">World Health Organization</a>, including diseases like psoriasis, arthritis, Crohn’s disease/ulcerative colitis, asthma, Multiple Sclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, as well as many types of cancer (diabetes not included). Unfortunately, the current IV-administered treatments are both exhausting and burdensome on both the patient and the healthcare system, according to the U.S. National Institute of Health <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6182494/">(NIH) </a>. </p>
      <p>These two reasons prompted Enable Injections<u> </u>to begin developing its self-infusion device nearly a decade ago.  “With this device, I could be self-treating right now,” said Flaherty. “You could do it at home, at school, at work. So, it has the potential to be life-changing.”</p>
      <p>Some European countries already <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6182494/">allow</a> patients to self-treat some chronic diseases. But the results have raised some concerns, including the risks of under or over-dosing. U.S. medical companies like Enable Injections must counter those challenges in order to get FDA approval to bring their devices to market.</p>
      <p>“Today, we are a pre-revenue company,” said Flaherty. “Pharmaceutical companies reimburse us to develop the device.”</p>
      <p>Currently, Enable Injections partners with seven pharma customers, with some programs in <a href="https://enableinjections.com/the-human-element-in-drug-delivery-device-design/">clinical trials</a>. Overall, the company has raised over $80 million to bring its device to the U.S. market. </p>
      <p>“Some of our (pharma) customers are talking about buying millions of devices a year per drug,” said Flaherty. “So, you add four or five customers to those volumes, you can get to be a billion-dollar company really quick. The pharma companies will skin the infusion devices with their own brands, and pharmacies will bill patients’ insurance for the drug-device combo package.  The drug companies will likely determine the cost.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do it right the first time</b>
      </p>
      <p>Anticipating hyper-scale growth, leaders at Enable Injections vowed to “do it right the first time.” Their goal was to deploy the right tech backbone <a href="https://enableinjections.com/scaling-for-success-why-enable-injections-is-the-earliest-stage-adopter-of-sap/">upfront</a> through a phased-in approach, to avoid costly and problematic band-aid upgrades later.</p>
      <p>“We recommended that Enable Injections choose SAP for this initiative, not only because it could support businesses scaling from startup to full production, but specifically because of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices">FDA</a> regulated requirements that are necessary for quality and trials, production design and inventory traceability - and to do that in a way to actually make a profit as a business,” said Don Dickinson of SAP Gold Partner <a href="https://www.dickinson-assoc.com/">Dickinson + Associates</a>.</p>
      <p>“They’re going to need the scale the cloud provides,” said Dickinson. “So, we’ve come up with the right way in the cloud to give them the platform to support their needs now but will scale as they go to a very large organization with the volumes of business they’re expecting.”</p>
      <p>“We’ll be able to ‘flip the switch,’ and scale as large as we need to be,” said Flaherty. “Eighty percent of the pharmaceutical companies also use SAP, so it shows our partners that we’re serious about doing business with them.”</p>
      <p>As Starshak tours the Cincinnati production plant with Flaherty, she watches the assembly-line process through windows that protect the sterilized environment. Workers in white smocks, hair nets and gloves operate two production lines, one for 10 ml medical treatments and another for 20 ml treatments.  </p>
      <p>Currently, the startup employs less than 200 developers, engineers, technicians and medical experts but once the device is in market, contract manufacturing will automate this process, in order to scale production for high volumes quickly.</p>
      <p>“They’re thinking about quickly growing their workforce, recruiting them and onboarding within FDA-regulated requirements,” said Dickinson. “They need the ability to track learning and training that goes on with all these employees, and SAP SuccessFactors supports the FDA validation requirements.”</p>
      <p>Patients like Starshak hope self-treatment devices like this from Enable Injections will add more freedom to their lives. </p>
      <p>“It’s great to see something like this come to life and come to market,” said Starshak. “As a chronic illness patient, I think it’s important for us to be able to control what we can and make things easy when we can, because we’re never going to be able to control all of it.”</p>
