      <p><b>Topline</b>: Taylor Swift’s former record label, Big Machine Records, agreed Monday to license her old music for an upcoming performance at the American Music Awards, a win for Swift in her long-running, bitter and public feud with the men in charge of the label, Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a <a href="https://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/news/big-machine-label-group-informed-dick-clark-productions-today-they-have-agreed-grant-all">statement </a>released Monday, Big Machine Records said it had “agreed to grant all licenses of their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms.” </li>
        <li>Big Machine’s decision means that Swift can sing her old songs on television and any official video of the performance put online afterwards won’t be a violation of a provision in her contract preventing her from rerecording her music.</li>
        <li>Swift had claimed in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/14/taylor-swift-says-scooter-braun-is-blocking-her-from-playing-her-old-music/#305127865ea2">statement </a>on Twitter last week that Braun and Borchetta were preventing her from performing her old music at the AMAs because Big Machine owns the rights to songs recorded before Swift’s most recent album, “Lover.”</li>
        <li>After the social media uproar—driven in large part by her legions of fans—Big Machine responded with its own <a href="https://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/news/taylor-swifts-partner-over-decade-we-were-shocked-see-her-tumblr-statements-yesterday-based">statement</a>, saying that “at no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs.” (Swift hadn’t claimed she couldn’t perform at all, just that she couldn’t perform her old songs.)</li>
        <li>The heated back-and-forth even involved 2020 Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom weighed in <a href="https://www.salon.com/2019/11/17/aoc-and-elizabeth-warren-defend-taylor-swift-against-private-equity-groups-predatory-practices/">supporting</a> Swift. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here’s Big Machine’s full statement: </p>
      <p>“The Big Machine Label Group informed Dick Clark Productions today that they have agreed to grant all licenses of their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media.  Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Swift and Big Machine have been publicly feuding with back-and-forth statements on social media since June, when prolific music manager Scooter Braun bought Big Machine for $300 million, acquiring the rights to her master recordings. At the time, Swift said it was her “worst case scenario” because Braun had “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/07/01/heres-why-taylor-swift-hates-scooter-braun-so-much/#66e7b5782084">bullied</a>” her through his clients, namely Kanye West, during the <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/news/a41965/taylor-swift-kanye-west-feud-timeline/">fracas </a>surrounding West’s music video for “Famous.”</p>
      <p>Swift signed with Universal Music Group last year, eschewing Big Machine, the label she had been with since she was 15. She says Big Machine owner Borchetta didn’t allow her to own her previous work and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/08/report-taylor-swift-suggests-she-didnt-try-to-buy-masters/#5cba5eb45a05">would </a>only let her “earn” one master recording each time she recorded a new album. Swift’s new deal allows her to own her future work, and she plans on rerecording her old masters to regain control of her music.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent</b>: Swift and Big Machine are also fighting about money. Swift says the label owes her $7.9 million in unpaid royalties, while Big Machine says Swift owes the label “millions of dollars and multiple assets.”</p>
      <p><b>What’s next</b>: Swift also claimed last week that Braun and Borchetta were blocking her old music from being used in a soon-to-be released Netflix documentary about her life. That issue hasn’t been resolved yet. (Big Machine said in a statement last week that it didn’t “block her Netflix special,” but Swift accused the label of blocking her old songs from being used in the documentary, not of blocking its release.)</p>
