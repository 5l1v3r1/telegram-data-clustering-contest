      <p>BOSTON (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-brown/">Antonio Brown</a> has apologized to the Patriots and team owner <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-kraft/">Robert Kraft</a> for any negative attention he brought to the team during his brief stint in New England.</p>
      <p>The four-time All-Pro receiver posted his apology on Instagram Tuesday, writing: “All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama!”</p>
      <p>The apology comes on the heels of past posts in which he indicated he’d fight the Patriots’ decision to withhold a $9 million signing bonus. He also reportedly met with NFL officials last week to discuss various sexual assault allegations against him that could make him subject to a possible suspension under the league’s personal conduct policy if he’s signed by another team.</p>
      <p>The Patriots cut ties with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-brown/">Brown</a> in September following just one game after a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct. They were the third team in less than a year to tire of the off-field behavior that has overshadowed his on-field accomplishments.</p>
      <p>On his first unemployed NFL Sunday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/antonio-brown/">Brown</a> took shots at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-kraft/">Kraft</a> and longtime Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
