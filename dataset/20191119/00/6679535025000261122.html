      <p>A team of excise officers seized 10 kg of ganja from a car and arrested a man who was suspected to have been a key link in the wholesale narcotic trade here on Monday.</p>
      <p>The excise team arrested Abdul Jaleel, 28, from Manjeri in Malappuram district, on a tip-off received by Excise Deputy Commissioner Sulesh Kumar V.P.</p>
      <p>The excise team tried to stop Mr. Jaleel’s car at the Walayar checkpost, but he did not stop. Another team blocked the car at the toll plaza, and the ganja was found hidden in a special compartment under the back seat of the car. The compartment could be opened only with a switch fitted underneath the driver’s seat.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jaleel reportedly admitted that he procured the ganja from near Tiripur in Tamil Nadu for ₹1 lakh. He has been dealing in ornamental fish.</p>
      <h3>Cover-up</h3>
      <p>excise officers said that Mr. Jaleel chose ornamental fish business to cover up his narcotic trade. He is suspected to be a wholesale dealer in Kerala.</p>
      <p>Assistant Commissioner B. Venugopala Kurup said that the case would be handed over to the Crime Branch.</p>
      <p>The excise team led by special squad Circle Inspector M. Rakesh included preventive officers Mansoor Ali and K. Vellakutty, civil excise officers G. Shiju, R. Unnikrishnan, T.V. Akhil, Praveen C., Vishakh, Sinoj C., and Lissy V.K.</p>
