      <p>When Sapphire Bates first had the idea for <a href="https://thecovengirlgang.com/">The Coven</a> – a digital networking community that connects self-employed women all over the world – she had no real notion how she was going to turn it into a viable business. Certainly – a female network connecting creative women the world over was an excellent idea, but making it profitable… that was another issue entirely. But make it profitable she did, with 250 paying members signing up on the first day of the launch. A launch she orchestrated whilst also still running her florist business single-handedly – something that flies in the face of recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/how-to-make-sure-your-next-product-or-service-launch-drives-growth">McKinsey research</a> showing that more than 50% of new product launches fail.</p>
      <p>The network has now gone through two rounds of launches since first opening in June 2019, now has over 950 paying members and another 2,300 women on the waitlist. Next year, the plan is to open the doors another for times as well launch an Australasia branch as well.</p>
      <p>So how did she do it?  </p>
      <p>Though it would be easy to simply attribute it to the branding (a striking clash of scarlet and millennial pink) or the accessible price points (there are three membership tiers to suit different needs) the answer is far more simple, even than that – success was the only option.</p>
      <p>“I desperately needed it to work, so the plan was to get it in front of as many people as possible,” she said, whilst being interviewed from her UK home.</p>
      <p>Here, she shares the lessons she’s learned through orchestrating two successful launches, as well as what she’ll be taking with her into 2020 to pull off more of the same.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Make a business plan</b>
      </p>
      <p>This might be stating the obvious but many people actively avoid making them, for fear that they will ‘stifle’ creative energy. Sapphire advises against this.</p>
      <p>“I sat on the idea for The Coven for a while whilst I tried to work out how it could make money. A big part was researching what was already out there and testing different business models. I tell everyone to make a business plan, even if you’re not going to show it to anyone because for your own understanding, it’s key. As I came up with a plan every part had to show me that it was a good idea. Knowing if you’re going to need investment or a different launch model at the beginning makes it so much easier.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Refine your target market then refine it some more</b>
      </p>
      <p>Too many businesses are targeting the wrong market or not targeting at all. For Sapphire, ensuring that she was reaching the right people and giving them what they actually wanted was key. Working this out meant undergoing months of market research and being open to constructive criticism from trusted peers:</p>
      <p>“Sometimes, the purpose your business is actually serving isn’t’ what you think it is. I spent months on market research working out if my customer was who I really thought they were, whether my price point was right or not and testing whether the pain point I had in my mind was actually what other people were overcoming by using the service.</p>
      <p>“When you’re really close to an idea, it’s hard to be objective but when the advice comes from people you trust, it’s highly valuable. That’s why I bounced the idea off a few close friends before launching, as I knew they would give me really valuable feedback.”</p>
      <p>
        <b> Know where your target market is</b>
      </p>
      <p>If your target market is a particular demographic, having a good understanding of where they’re most likely to digest and engage with your marketing should be high on your pre-launch checklist because that way, you can ensure the efforts you make are worth it.</p>
      <p>“Telling people about the business before it launched was my next step,” Sapphire explained. “You can’t launch a business to nobody so you have to work out where your audience is and how your brand will fit in. For me, that was on Instagram. I spent months building my network, finding people who I thought were my audience and actually taking an interest in them, not just selling to them.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Engage, don’t just sell</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Economist Group’s <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/LeanBack1/contentmarketingstudy">‘Missing the Mark’ report</a> found that 71% of consumers are consumers are put off by content that seems like a sales pitch. Everyone knows that customers want a deeper message than a simple sale, yet many business owners get desperate as that launch day gets nearer.  Sapphire advises finding the meaningful message that customers can engage with and showing them the reason you’re launching the product beyond the simple desire to make money.</p>
      <p>“[The first launch] was very spontaneous. For the second, I’d mapped out my marketing plan on my calendar and had a key message to get across that I felt my audience would most engage with. I led with my strongest selling point.</p>
      <p>“The main thing is that you genuinely have to be as excited as you claim you are. When I talk about it online, I am genuinely excited about building this community, which is what comes across. If you’re selling something, you need a driver that’s not just money – I think if you don’t, that’s when a launch doesn’t go well. If people are just after your money, that comes across, whereas if you have a reason behind your service or product, people are more likely to trust it.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>You also need to talk about your product. A lot.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Think you’re talking about what you do too much. Trust us, you’re not. And you probably need to be talking about it more. Research actually suggests that a customer needs to hear about a product or service 7 times before they’ll buy, so the more actively engaged you are in talking about it in a meaningful way, the better your chance of landing more sales.</p>
      <p>“You realise after a while that no-one’s listening as much as you think they are,” says Sapphire.</p>
      <p>“There’s so much information on all platforms that people don’t really take it in. You have to keep saying talking about your business because, half the time people, aren’t really listening. We assume as the marketer that everyone’s reading everything we do all the time but that’s not the case. Drip feeding is so important. It’s so easy to forget that you, as a consumer, are exactly the same as everyone else. People need time to feel safe to buy.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Make time for strategy</b>
      </p>
      <p>In between all the marketing, you still need to make time to work on your business rather than just in it, as this is what will ensure learn from your mistakes and start setting targets for the future, regardless of whether you’re looking to expand or not. This is Sapphire’s forte.</p>
      <p>“Stepping outside of the day to day and trying to think big is my favourite part [of running the business]. I like setting the targets and monitoring the business’ performance and analysing it - looking at the logistics excites me. Even if you’re down in the depths of the day-to-day, try to make time to think about the longer term and the bigger picture, even if it’s just 30 minutes a week.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>If you wait for perfection you’ll never get started</b>
      </p>
      <p>For Sapphire, the ultimate key to pulling off a successful launch is taking the leap before you feel ready.</p>
      <p>“One piece of advice I always try to live by is that nothing is perfect but everything can be improved. People often worry because they think something isn’t perfect and it prevents them from starting at all. The truth, though, is that everything can be improved so it’s better to start and adapt than simply to not start at all.”</p>
