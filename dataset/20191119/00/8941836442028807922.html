      <p>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A western New York man pleaded guilty Monday to threatening to kill U.S. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Rep. Ilhan Omar</a> of Minnesota.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-carlineo/">Patrick Carlineo</a> entered the plea Monday in Rochester, admitting to charges that carry up to 10 years in prison. His sentencing is set for Feb. 14.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney James Kennedy Jr. said the case highlights that free speech rights carry the responsibility “that individuals not make threats to harm lawmakers simply because they may disagree with them.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Omar</a>, a Democrat, is among the first Muslim women in Congress. Her office had no immediate comment on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-carlineo/">Carlineo</a>’s plea.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the 55-year-old called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Omar</a>’s office March 21, told a staffer the congresswoman was a “terrorist” and threatened to shoot her.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-carlineo/">Carlineo</a> later told the FBI that he is a patriot, hates people he perceives to be radical Muslims in the U.S. government, and loves Republican President Donald Trump, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-carlineo/">Carlineo</a>’s lawyer, Sonya Zoghlin, says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-carlineo/">Carlineo</a> is passionate about his political beliefs and his right to express them.</p>
      <p>“He has taken responsibility for using threatening and inappropriate language to express those beliefs in this instance,” she said in an email, adding that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-carlineo/">Carlineo</a> never intended to harm <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Omar</a> and never made any plans to do so.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-carlineo/">Carlineo</a>’s plea included admitting he illegally had guns. He’d been barred from possessing them after a 1998 felony criminal mischief conviction, prosecutors said.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Omar</a>, a Somali-American, has faced criticism from Trump and others for remarks she made in recent months about Israel, Jewish influence in Washington, and 9/11.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Omar</a> has apologized for suggesting that lawmakers support Israel for money, has said she wasn’t criticizing Jews, and has said that criticizing the Israeli government is not anti-Semitic.</p>
        <p>Last month, a North Dakota state senator said he was sorry for posting a long-debunked photo that purported to show <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Omar</a> holding a weapon at an al-Qaida training camp. But the lawmaker, Republican Oley Larsen, added that he wouldn’t apologize to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ilhan-omar/">Omar</a>.</p>
