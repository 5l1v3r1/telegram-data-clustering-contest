      <h1>Patrick Frazee found guilty of murdering fiancée Kelsey Berreth</h1>

      <p>A jury on Monday found Colorado dad Patrick Frazee guilty of murdering his fiancée, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/19/fiance-allegedly-beat-missing-mom-kelsey-berreth-to-death-with-bat-burned-her-body/">went missing on Thanksgiving Day</a> last year.</p>
      <p>The jury convicted the Colorado rancher, 33, of beating to death Kelsey Berreth, 29, with a baseball bat while their 1-year-old daughter was in a nearby room — then burning the body and convincing his girlfriend <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/21/cops-arrest-fiance-of-missing-colorado-mom-kelsey-berreth/">to cover up the crime</a>.</p>
      <p>Frazee showed no reaction to the verdict, while Berreth’s family sobbed and hugged one another.</p>

      <p>The woman’s body and the murder weapon have never been found.</p>
      <p>With little physical evidence, jurors relied on the testimony of Frazee’s former lover Krystal Lee — an Idaho nurse who testified that Frazee <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/19/fiance-allegedly-beat-missing-mom-kelsey-berreth-to-death-with-bat-burned-her-body/">asked her to clean up the scene of the killing</a> and that she watched him burn a plastic tote that she believed contained Berreth’s body.</p>
      <p>Lee described the crime scene as “horrific” and told cops that she <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/03/nurse-may-have-played-role-in-kelsey-berreths-disappearance/">intentionally left blood splatter</a> in parts of the apartment as evidence.</p>
      <p>On the final day of testimony, jail inmate Jacob Bentley told the jury that Frazee asked him to kill Lee, Lee’s relatives and the case’s lead investigator while the two of them were housed near each other in jail.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors never gave a motive of the murder, but Berreth’s parents in a wrongful-death lawsuit said they believed Frazee murdered the woman because he wanted full custody of their daughter, who now lives with them.</p>
