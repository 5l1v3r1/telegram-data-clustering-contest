      <p>Valve just announced a new <i>Half-Life </i>game. Well, they announced that they would be revealing a new <i>Half-Life </i>game this Thursday.The game is called <i>Half-Life: Alyx, </i>which means it’s not the game we wanted. We wanted, and have wanted for many years, <i>Half-Life 3 </i>or even <i>Half-Life: Episode 3 </i>or really <i>any</i> Valve game with a “3” attached to it.</p>
      <p>The real kicker is that <i>Half-Life: Alyx </i>is a VR game. It’s Valve’s first (of three) AAA VR games and I find the news so, so very depressing.</p>
      <p>I have had some fun with VR headsets. Virtual Reality is amusing. It’s a novelty. It’s that thing you show your friends and then forget about until more friends come over and want to see what all the fuss is about. It is no kind of replacement for traditional gaming.</p>
      <p>Will a AAA Valve-made <i>Half-Life </i>game give the virtual reality industry a much-needed extra life? Or will it be a total waste of resources when they could be making an incredible FPS instead? Or a new <i>Portal </i>game? Or any kind of traditional game instead of just selling hats and loot boxes and pipe dreams about any kind of future where VR is more widely accepted than screen-based gaming . . . .</p>
      <p>I admire Valve’s determination here. The company very badly wants the technology to work out, and–thanks to coffers of Steam plunder–can focus on VR and wearable tech and try to pave new futures instead of code new games people actually want.</p>
      <p>But until we’re in a <i>Star Trek </i>future with actual Holodecks, VR is just a diversion. And it’s insulting to those of us who played all of Valve’s games almost religiously back in the day, that instead of <i>Half-Life 3 </i>we’re getting <i>Half-Life: Alyx. </i>A diversion–instead of another great game.</p>
      <p>Oh well. I never expected Valve to make <i>Half-Life 3 </i>anyway. I wager George R.R. Martin will finish <i>The Winds Of Winter </i>and maybe even the next one before Valve releases <i>Half-Life 3.</i></p>
