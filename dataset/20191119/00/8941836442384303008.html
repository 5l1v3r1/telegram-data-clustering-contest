      <h1>Ohio lawmakers propose jailing women who get abortions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/christopher-vondracek/" target="_blank">Christopher Vondracek</a></address>
      <p>Two Ohio Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation that would ban abortion and require women who undergo the procedure to be imprisoned.</p>
      <p>“The time for regulating evil and compromise is over,” said state Rep. Candice Keller, who last week introduced the bill with state Rep. Ron Hood.</p>
      <p>The bill, which has 19 cosponsors in the state House, was referred Monday to the Criminal Justice Committee.</p>
      <p>No companion legislation has been submitted in the state Senate.</p>
      <p>House Bill 413 would allow an abortion only to save a woman’s life.</p>
