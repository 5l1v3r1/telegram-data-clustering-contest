      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/columbus/">COLUMBUS</a>, Ohio — Ohio’s capital city has formally approved a $450,000 settlement for porn actress Stormy Daniels over her 2018 strip club arrest.</p>
      <p>Daniels’ federal defamation lawsuit against several <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/columbus/">Columbus</a> officers alleged officers conspired to retaliate against her over her claims that she had sex with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> before he became president.</p>
      <p>Columbus City Council approved the settlement Monday night for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. The Dispatch reports Clifford originally demanded $2 million, according to the city solicitor general.</p>
      <p>Clifford’s attorneys are challenging a request by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s lawyers to stake claim to the settlement.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s lawyers have noted in a filing to the court involved in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/columbus/">Columbus</a> judgment that Clifford owes him $293,052 after a judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit she had filed against the president.</p>
