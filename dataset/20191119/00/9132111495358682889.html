      <p>The pathologist at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital who conducted a post-moterm on the late Major Maxwell Adams Mahama has said the ex-Military man died out of “multiple head injuries.”</p>
      <p>Dr Lawrence Edusei, who is the 13th Prosecution witness in the trial in which some 14 persons are standing trial for murder, told the Criminal Division of the Accra High Court that the ex-soldier died an unnatural death.</p>
      <p>Being led by the Chief State Attorney, Mrs Evelyn Keelson to give evidence, the witness told the court that “the cause of death is multiple head injuries due to blunt objects and shotguns which are unnatural cause of death.”</p>
      <p>Dr Edusei, also a visiting pathologist at the 37 Military Hospital explained further that the blunt objects are objects that do not have sharp edges like stone, wood and iron rods.</p>
      <p>The pathologist also revealed to the court presided over by Justice Mariama Owusu, (one of the three Judges appointed by the President waiting for confirmation to the Supreme Court) that two pellets were also retrieved in the brain of the late military man.</p>
