        <b>On Tuesday, 19 November, the opposition of Riga City Council will likely abstain or not participate at all in the vote regarding the dismissal of the city council’s vice-chairman Vadims Baraņņiks, as told by <i>For Latvia’s Development</i> faction chairman Viesturs Zeps.</b>
      </p>
      <p>«To a large degree this is a fight within the coalition, and the opposition has been pulled into it. Currently the opposition has a large say in how the city council works. This is why our actions and tactics will be as unified as they can be,» explains Zeps, adding that opposition parties have discussed their position today.</p>
      <p>He says opposition parties will likely abstain or not participate in the meeting at all.</p>
      <p>«This may be the first meeting to have not happened. The first step towards snap elections or some other solution,» said Zeps.</p>
      <p>He explains that <i>Harmony</i> basically blackmails Riga City Council chairman Oļegs Burovs with its condition to remove Baraņņiks from his post before the party decides to start attending meetings again.</p>
      <p>Zeps says this gives the opposition more power, because if Harmony does not show up for meetings, all decisions are made with support from the opposition.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When asked about the letter sent to opposition parties by the <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>, <i>For Riga</i> and independent deputy Baiba Broka, Zeps said they have yet to receive it, but if this is about dissolving the entire city council, such a proposal may come only from the opposition, not independent deputies.</p>
      <p>«If we reach an agreement, we will get together as the opposition and make a decision. If we decide our tactic is sound, we will take this letter into account,» says Zeps.</p>
      <p>As it is reported, the <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>, <i>For Riga</i> and Broka invite opposition parties to dismiss the entire city council, as confirmed by <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i> head Valērijs Petrovs.</p>
      <p>The letter explains that an extraordinary meeting of the city council on Tuesday, 19 November, may take place only if <i>Harmony</i> and <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> provide their votes to the opposition.</p>
      <p>«This means that because the opposition is able to initiate a process for dismissal of the entire Riga City Council and ensure neither <i>Harmony</i> nor <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> are able to make any questionable decisions. This basically allows the option to take control over processes of Riga City Council on Wednesday, when the next meeting is scheduled, without involvement from <i>Harmony</i> and <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> to continue playing their power game,» the letter mentions.</p>
