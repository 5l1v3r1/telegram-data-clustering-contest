      <p>Dilapidated six (6) classroom block of Central Agric Station Primary School in the Kwadaso Municipality of the Ashanti Region (A/R) has been occupied by snakes and other creeping creatures, making teaching and learning ineffective, Mypurefmonline.com reports.</p>
      <p>The six (6) units classroom block which was built in 2007 by the former Member of Parliament for Kwadaso Constituency, Hon Hilda Addo is now serving as a death trap as it has not seen any renovation since its opening.</p>
      <p>Pure FM’s reporter Osei Kwadwo popularly known as Ambassador reports on ‘Pure Morning Drive’ Tuesday, November 19, that the dilapidated school building could collapse anytime soon, calling on the authorities of the region to take immediate action.</p>
      <p>The pupils of Central Agric Station Primary speaking to Osei Kwadwo explained that they feel uncomfortable using the school’s structure due to its poor condition.</p>
      <p>“Some of our friends are now staying home without coming to school because of the state of the school. The condition of the school is very bad. Our lives are in danger. We are appealing to authorities to come to our aid to avoid any disaster. Snakes have been chasing us from our classrooms and we close early when it threatens to rain,” the pupils told Osei Kwadwo.</p>
      <p>The headmistress of the school Mrs. Justina Nti Agyekum expressing the school grievances said the state of the school is affecting teaching and learning of the school.</p>
      <p>According to Mrs. Justina Nti Agyekum, some parents have threatened to withdraw their children from the school due to its poor state.</p>
      <p>“All the pillars supporting the classroom are weak which is making the situation dangerous. We are forced to close the pupils anytime it threatens to rain and the students do not come to school when it rains. The situation is so pathetic” She explained.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Justina Nti Agyekum added that she has written to the appropriate authorities to appeal for support but is yet to receive response on her appeal.</p>
      <p>“I have written several appeals to the authorities (The MP and the MCE for Kwadaso) but we are yet to hear from them. We are appealing to stakeholders and authorities to come to our aid. The school lacks basic facilities like library, water and teaching and learning material.”</p>
