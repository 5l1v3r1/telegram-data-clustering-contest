        <b>Genk midfielder Joseph Paintsil is urging his colleagues to beat Cote D’Ivoire in the semi-finals of the Africa U-23 Championship in order to secure a spot in next year’s Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Black Meteors defied all odds to secure a place in the last four after defeating Mali 2-0 in the final group game thanks to a brace from Kwabena Owusu.</p>
      <p>Cameroon’s defeat to Egypt ensured Ghana sailed through to the next round.</p>
      <p>Ghana is hoping to break its 15-year jinx of not qualifying to the Olympic football tournament in this competition and a win against Cote D’Ivoire U-23 will grant them an automatic ticket to the tournament.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with GHANAsoccernet.com, Joseph Paintsil who was unable to join the team to the tournament said, “I have been following the team at the tournament and I am really excited about the feat they have achieved so far.</p>
      <p>“It has always been our goal to qualify for the Olympic Games since we started playing the qualifiers and I know God is on our side and we will make it. I wish them all the best of luck against Cote D’Ivoire in the semi-finals”, he added.</p>
      <p>The Genk midfielder was unable to make the squad because the Belgium champions were unwilling to release the Ghanaian International for the two- week tournament which started on November 8-22, 2019.</p>
      <p>The four teams to be competing for the three slots at this stage are host nation Egypt, Ghana, Cote D’Ivoire and South Africa.</p>
      <p>Three teams will represent Africa in the Olympic Games tournament in Tokyo next year.</p>
