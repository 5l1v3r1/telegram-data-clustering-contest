      <h1>A US Politician Ripped A Massive Fart Out Of His Goddamned Ass On Live TV</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:55:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>Just for some background here: <b>Eric Swalwell</b> is a US Congressman representing the 15th Congressional District in California, which covers a large area of southern Oakland and its surrounds. He was elected to Congress in 2013, and in April this year announced he’d be seeking the Democratic Party Nomination for President in 2020. In July, he dropped out of the race. Today, he dropped a big, stinky fart out of his doo doo ass on live television.</p>
      <p>Swalwell has been a loud voice in the continual push for the impeachment of President Trump. Today, he pushed a big fucking fart out of his goddamned butt on live international TV.</p>
      <p>Swalwell was appearing live on MSNBC with <i>Hardball </i>host <b>Chris Matthews</b> when the offending, ripcord-like fart took place.</p>

      <p>The majesty of live television captured the moment – that moment being when Democratic US Congressman Eric Swalwell blew the gooch out of his suit pants by grunting a banshee-like tummy cough out of his anal sphincter – and there’s really no doubt as to what went down.</p>

      <p>That’s a fart, brother. That’s an honest-to-god Congressional fart on live goddamned TV.</p>
      <p>My dude even pauses mid-sentence to squeeze it out. He visibly clenches. Old mate rocks forward onto the balls of his toes to push that bad boy out into the world. And he just continues his train of thought without even so much as blinking.</p>
      <p>That’s the mark of a pro. You simply cannot teach that.</p>
      <p>That’s not doctored footage either. Multiple social media types caught the moment and have been flooding the TL with various astounded reactions. Much like Swalwell’s pants are now flooded with ass gas.</p>
