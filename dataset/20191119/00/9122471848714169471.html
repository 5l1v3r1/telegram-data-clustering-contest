      <h1>CBS Releases Its Week 13 College Football Top 10</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:24:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 of the college football season saw two unbeaten teams fall and a devastating injury for one of the sport’s best players. CBS has unveiled its latest power rankings before Week 13.</p>
      <p>Somewhat surprisingly, Dennis Dodd still has Minnesota <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-power-rankings-just-like-that-oklahoma-is-back-in-the-playoff-picture/">in his top five</a>, even after the Gophers lost to Iowa. Meanwhile, Oklahoma jumped five spots to No. 6 after beating undefeated Baylor.</p>
      <p>LSU, Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia are the current top four for Dodd, and those will be the top four teams when tomorrow’s College Football Playoff rankings are released. Besides that though, expect Dodd’s rankings to look a lot different than the committee’s will.</p>
      <p>Here is the full top 10 courtesy of CBS Sports.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Minnesota</li>

        <li>Penn State</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
        <li>Alabama</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can view Dodd’s full top 25 <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-power-rankings-just-like-that-oklahoma-is-back-in-the-playoff-picture/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>In Week 13, the biggest matchup features Ohio State battling Penn State for the Big Ten East. The last three matchups between these two rivals have been decided by a total of five points.</p>
