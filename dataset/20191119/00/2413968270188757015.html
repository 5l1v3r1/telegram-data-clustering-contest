      <p>Africa Data Centres (ADC), the largest network of interconnected, vendor- and carrier-neutral data centres on the continent has extended its partnership with China Telecom Global (CTG), one of the world’s largest providers of integrated telecommunication services, through the deployment of a China Telecom Point of Presence (POP) at Africa Data Centres’ JHB 1 data centre in South Africa.</p>

      <p>Through the POP, China Telecom will offer <a href="https://www.africadatacentres.com/">Africa Data Centres’</a> customers extended global connectivity and Internet services, as well as Internet peering through the Johannesburg Internet Exchange (JINX), also hosted at the Johannesburg facility in Midrand.</p>
      <p>The facility, which boasts a current design capacity of 14 MW, is strategically located near the heart of South Africa’s business district, and China Telecom expects the location, as well as its enterprise-grade and cloud-ready amenities, to be a compelling colocation environment for international organisations and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), which will attract companies from a wide range of business sectors who wish to increase their connectivity.</p>
      <p>Through its broader partnership with Africa Data Centres, China Telecom will also be able to offer data centre colocation services to its customers in several countries in Africa.</p>
      <p>“Africa Data Centres has facilities located at Africa’s major regional business and trade hubs, including Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Kenya, and will be expanding its footprint to West Africa and North Africa, as well as other areas we believe, are emerging as the epicentre for Africa’s digital economy,” says Stephane Duproz, CEO of Africa Data Centres</p>
      <p>Changhai Liu, MD of China Telecom (Africa and the Middle East) adds, “Africa is without a doubt one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. With over 50 countries in the region, Africa is an incredibly important market for China Telecom, and we hope this collaboration will help both us and Africa Data Centres better serve our customers in the region, as well as identify new business opportunities on the continent.”</p>
      <p>Duproz continues, “China Telecom’s investment in <a href="https://www.africadatacentres.com/">Africa Data Centres’</a> points of presence means our customers can look forward to reliable, low-latency, worldwide connectivity, which will enable them to deploy their applications and workloads quickly and efficiently. China Telecom’s presence is more than just an addition to the growing list of carriers at our carrier-neutral Johannesburg data centre, it heralds the start of a long and fruitful relationship aimed at growing colocation services across the continent”.</p>
