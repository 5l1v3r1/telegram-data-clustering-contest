      <h1>Atiku Reveals Why Jonathan Is Happy With APC Victory In Bayelsa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>Governor Atiku Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State has revealed that former President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/what-jonathan-said-after-inec-declared-apcs-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>Goodluck Jonathan</b></u></a> is happy with the victory of David Lyon in the Bayelsa Governorship election.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the National Electoral Commission (INEC), had declared <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>David Lyon the winner of the Bayelsa Governorship Election</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Lyon scored a total of 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party, Duoye Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>After the election, Governor<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/bayelsa-apc-governors-visit-ex-president-goodluck-jonathan-photos/"><u> Atiku alongside other chieftains of the APC</u></a> paid a visit to the home of the former Nigerian leader.</p>
      <p>The delegation of APC leaders also met with <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/just-in-buhari-in-closed-door-meeting-with-oshiomhole-apc-govs-others/"><u><b>President Muhammadu Buhari</b></u></a> at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Monday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to State House correspondents, Atiku said despite being in another party, Jonathan was pleased because the victory of the APC was transparent.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“We were in Bayelsa for over 72 hours, we didn’t see a tyre burning, we didn’t see people running, we didn’t hear a gunshot, everyone was celebrating in all the areas we passed, which shows the acceptance of our candidate, our party and the process itself.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is equally noteworthy that Bayelsa is a home of a former president of Nigeria and this election won by a party different from the one he belongs, has been accepted by all including people around him.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“And so far, from what we hear, he is also happy with the outcome irrespective of the difference in the party, which is an indication of the transparency of the process.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Many people worked hard in making this happen, most importantly, Mr President, who has always shown the party that win or lose we should aim for free, transparent and fair elections.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“That is what will guarantee peace, confer legitimacy and support for elected persons to proudly execute the mandate that they are given. And in Bayelsa we have seen a demonstration of that. Everyone is talking about how free, transparent and fair the election was.”</i>
