      <h1>Kawhi Leonard to miss third straight game, sources say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:24:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:24</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a> forward <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> will miss Monday's game against the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a>, sources told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.</p>
      <p>Leonard suffered a left knee contusion in the second half of the Clippers' loss to the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> on Wednesday and did not play against New Orleans on Thursday or Atlanta on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Leonard has missed five of the Clippers' 14 games this season and has yet to play alongside teammate <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george">Paul George</a>, who made his Clippers debut on Thursday.</p>
      <p>George has helped mitigate Leonard's absence, having scored 70 points in just 44 minutes in the past two games.</p>
      <p>Leonard has been effective as well, when he has been on the court, averaging 26.8 points per game to go with a career-high six assists.</p>
