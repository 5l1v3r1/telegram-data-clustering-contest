      <p>In a veiled reference to the recent Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena fallout over differences on government formation in Maharashtra, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said that both sides will face loss if they "are going to fight over a matter".</p>

      <p>"Everybody knows that both of them will face loss if they are going to fight over a matter," he said.</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that selfishness is a bad thing but very few people give up their selfishness. Take the example of the country or of individuals," he added.</p>
      <p>These sharp comments from the RSS chief came while addressing an event in Nagpur on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena and the BJP, which contested the assembly polls together, parted ways after the conflict over power-sharing in the state.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena is currently in parley with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress to form a government.</p>
      <p>While the BJP emerged as the single-largest party in Maharashtra assembly polls with 105 seats, the NCP and Congress have 54 and 44 MLAs, respectively, in the state assembly.</p>
