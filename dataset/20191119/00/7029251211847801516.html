      <p>Cape Town. Safaricom and Huawei have jointly received the prestigious Most Innovative Service “the Business of Tomorrow” award at AfricaCom 2019 in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>This Award recognizes the two companies for offering the new revolutionary Mobile Money Overdraft service, known as “Fuliza”.</p>
      <p>This service enables users with insufficient funds in their M-Pesa accounts to borrow money to complete their M-Pesa transactions.</p>
      <p>The service was officially launched in January 2019 and has been gaining popularity in Kenya where Safaricom has over 23.6 million M-Pesa users.</p>
      <p>Kenyans transacted over KSh 6.2 Billion ($62 million) in Fuliza's first month after its launch.</p>
      <p>Michael Joseph, CEO, Safaricom said “M-Pesa continues to play a leading role in deepening financial inclusion in the country.
