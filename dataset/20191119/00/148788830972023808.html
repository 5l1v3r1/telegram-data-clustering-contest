      <h1>‘Roma’ Becomes the First Netflix Film to Join the Criterion Collection</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>While a few original Netflix shows have received Blu-ray releases, Netflix movies tend not to get the same treatment. But that’s about to change – in a big way. <b><i>Roma</i></b>, the Netflix movie that scored several Oscar nominations and took home Best Foreign Language Film, is getting a Blu-ray release – and not just any old Blu-ray release, either. We’re talking The Criterion Collection here, which is about as fancy as you can get in the Blu-ray world.</p>
      <p>I was wondering the other day if <i>The Irishman</i>, Martin Scorsese’s upcoming Netflix movie, would ever end up on Blu-ray. My original assumption was negative – after all, Netflix movies don’t usually get Blu releases. But then came the news that we’re getting a <i>Roma</i> Blu-ray release from Criterion. If that could happen for <b>Alfonso Cuaron</b>‘s award winner maybe <i>The Irishman</i> stands a chance as well.</p>
      <p><i>Roma</i> “follows Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a young domestic worker for a family in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma in Mexico City. Delivering an artful love letter to the women who raised him, Cuarón draws on his own childhood to create a vivid and emotional portrait of domestic strife and social hierarchy amidst political turmoil of the 1970s.” It was one of 2018’s best films, and <i>really</i> should’ve won Best Picture instead of <i>Green Book</i>, but its Best Foreign Language win is nothing to sneeze at.</p>
      <p>Bringing <i>Roma</i> to the Criterion Collection feels like a sea change of sorts. There was a time when the thought of a Netflix movie being released via Criterion seemed silly at best. Now, it’s a reality – and it makes sense. <i>Roma</i> is highly acclaimed and exactly the type of movie that fits into the collection. You might argue that a Netflix movie doesn’t <i>need</i> a Blu-ray release since it’s on Netflix already. But here’s the thing: not everyone has Netflix. And on top of that movies just look better on Blu-ray than they do on streaming. Bringing <i>Roma</i> to Criterion is a good move, and I can only hope some other Netflix films will follow in its footsteps. Yes, I’m talking about <i>Bright</i> (no I’m not).</p>
      <p>Best of all, the Criterion release gives us something we definitely can’t get on Netflix: special features. Here’s what the Criterion release includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4K digital master, supervised by director Alfonso Cuarón, with Dolby Atmos soundtrack on the Blu-ray</li>
        <li><i>Road to “Roma,”</i> a new documentary about the making of the film, featuring behind-the-scenes footage and an interview with Cuarón</li>
        <li><i>Snapshots from the Set,</i> a new documentary featuring actors Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira, producers Gabriela Rodríguez and Nicolás Celis, production designer Eugenio Caballero, casting director Luis Rosales, executive producer David Linde, and others</li>
        <li>New documentaries about the film’s sound and postproduction processes, featuring Cuarón; Sergio Diaz, Skip Lievsay, and Craig Henighan from the postproduction sound team; editor Adam Gough; postproduction supervisor Carlos Morales; and finishing artist Steven J. Scott</li>
        <li>New documentary about the film’s ambitious theatrical campaign and social impact in Mexico, featuring Celis and Rodríguez</li>
        <li><i>Nothing at Stake,</i> a new video essay by filmmaker :: kogonada</li>
        <li>Trailers</li>
        <li>Alternate French subtitles and Spanish SDH for the film</li>
        <li>PLUS: Essays by novelist Valeria Luiselli and historian Enrique Krauze, along with (Blu-ray only) writing by author Aurelio Asiain and production-design images with notes by Caballero</li>
      </ul>
