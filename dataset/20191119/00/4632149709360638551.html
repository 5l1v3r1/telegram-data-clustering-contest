      <p><i>By Euny Hong<br/><i><br/></i>The Korean art of ‘nunchi’ helps gauge the mood of a gathering, and can provide a springboard for success to those who can master it </i><br/><br/>Let’s imagine you have just started a new job at a big company, and you’re invited to a party where you want to make a great impression. When you walk into the room, everyone is laughing a bit too hard at the not-particularly-funny joke of an older woman you’ve never seen before. Do you: <br/><br/>A) Step in with a really funny joke, definitely much better than the one you just heard. Your new colleagues are going to love this! <br/><br/>B) Laugh along with the others, even though it’s not very amusing. <br/><br/>C) Find a tactful moment to introduce yourself to the older woman, who you’ve correctly assumed must be the head of the company. <br/><br/>If you chose A, you seriously need to work on your nunchi. If you chose B, good work, you read the room correctly and picked up the right cues from your new colleagues. If you chose C, congratulations, you’re already on your way to mastering the power of nunchi. <br/><br/>Nunchi is the Korean superpower. Some people even go so far as to say it’s how Korean people can read minds — though there’s nothing supernatural about it. Nunchi is the art of instantly understanding what people are thinking and feeling, in order to improve your relationships in life. Having great nunchi means continuously recalibrating your assumptions based on any new word, gesture or facial expression, so that you are always present and aware. Speed is paramount to nunchi; in fact, if someone is highly skilled at nunchi, Koreans don’t say they have ‘good’ nunchi, they say they have ‘quick’ nunchi. <br/><br/>In the short term, nunchi will save you from social embarrassment — you can’t make a faux pas if you’ve read the room correctly. In the long term, nunchi will make the waters part for you. People will open doors that you never even knew existed. Nunchi will help you live your best life. <br/><br/>Some are born with nunchi, some achieve nunchi, and some have nunchi thrust upon them. I had it thrust upon me. When I was twelve years old, my family moved from the US to South Korea. I didn’t speak the language at all, yet I was enrolled in a Korean public school. This was the best nunchi crash course I could have had, because I had to assimilate into a foreign culture with zero linguistic clues. In order to work out what was happening in my new country, I had to be hyper-reliant on my nunchi, which became my sixth sense. <br/><br/>What made it even more challenging was the huge nunchi gap between the US and Korea. In the US, interactions are informal, and you can get by with minimal nunchi. Americans don’t bow to each other; the language doesn’t have a ‘polite’ versus ‘familiar’ hierarchy; and you can call grown-ups by their first names. By contrast, the Korean culture and language are hierarchical and full of more rules than there are stars in the sky. For example, Koreans cannot even call their own older siblings by their first names; it has to be an honorific such as ‘older brother’ or ‘older sister’. According to Confucian principles, a harmonious society requires everyone to know their place and act accordingly. Problem: if I didn’t even know what to call my own siblings any more, I was 100 times more clueless as to how to behave in a Korean school. I had no lever to pull except for watching what the other schoolkids were doing. That’s how I learned two cardinal rules of nunchi: <br/><br/>1) if everyone is doing the same thing, there is always a reason. I had no idea how to stand at attention, or at ease; all I knew was that everyone else was doing it, so I studied their bodies closely and mimicked what they did; <br/><br/>2) if you wait long enough, most of your questions will be answered without your having to say a word. Which was great, because I didn’t know any words. <br/><br/>This nunchi trial-by-fire helped me understand what was expected of me, it opened my mind up to love learning, and it also made the teachers and students more patient with me. <br/><br/><b>You Need Nunchi<br/></b><br/>You have surely noticed that the more important a situation is, the greater the likelihood that the most crucial information is not expressed out loud, or not expressed truthfully. Nunchi might be your only ally in such moments. <br/><br/>When it comes to the practical application of nunchi in daily life, it’s important to understand that the unit of nunchi is the room. What I mean by this is that the object of your observation should not be an individual, but should be the room as a whole and how the individuals within it are acting and reacting. <br/><br/>Have you ever been in a room when a famous person walks in? Even if your back is to the door, and you can’t see who it is, you know from the reactions of everyone around you that something has changed. That is nunchi in action: an awareness of the cues we get from others. <br/><br/>You may not think of a room as a single living, breathing organism, but it is. It has its own ‘temperature’, ‘barometric pressure’, volume, mood – and these are in constant flux. Koreans talk of a room as having a boonwigi – the room’s atmosphere or wellness level, so to speak. Everyone is a contributing member of this boonwigi just by being there. Act with no nunchi, and you ruin the boonwigi for the whole room. Act with great, or ‘quick’, nunchi, and you can enhance the atmosphere of the room for everyone. <br/><br/>It may help to think of a room as a beehive. Even if everyone seems to be acting independently, a part of their brain is contributing to the hive mind. Everyone has a role. Including you. Your job? To work out what your role is. <br/><br/>Until you discover your role – and even after you do – you should always be ‘eye-assessing’: a fruitful activity with immediate benefits! You don’t have to be anxious about doing or saying the right thing if you remember your primary activity is eye assessment. <br/><br/><br/>So what is it that you’re observing? A skilled nunchi practitioner understands they are seeking answers to these two questions: ‘What is the emotional energy of this room?’ and ‘What kind of emotional energy can I emit in order to flow with that?’ <br/><br/>And why should you care about what vibes you are transmitting? It is best expressed in a saying often attributed to Maya Angelou: ‘I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.’ <br/><br/><br/><b>Excerpted from The Power of Nunchi: The Korean Secret to Happiness and Success (Penguin Random House)</b></p>
