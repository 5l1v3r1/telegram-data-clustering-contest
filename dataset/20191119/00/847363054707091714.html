      <p>Reports that new mayor Andy Foster wants to prioritise a second Mt Victoria Tunnel have reminded me that eight years ago the local community was concerned to discover that a second tunnel would require the four-laning of Ruahine Street.</p>
      <p>Andy held the council’s transport portfolio (under mayor Celia Wade-Brown) when Hataitai residents <a href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=33524">met in 2011 to express their opposition </a>to the widening of Ruahine Street and Wellington Road.</p>
      <p>Perhaps he has forgotten their concerns. Since his election as mayor, he’s been saying he <a href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=122912">wants to prioritise a second tunnel</a>, ahead of the introduction of mass rapid transit.</p>
      <p>And last week <a href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=123745">LGWM announced</a> that it was continuing its planning for a second tunnel – though it chose its words carefully, and said planning for mass rapid transit (“we need to determine the most appropriate route and type”) would also be continuing:</p>
      <blockquote>“The business case for state highway improvements will identify preferred options for the Basin Reserve and an extra Mt Victoria tunnel….<br/>It will … investigate the extra Mt Victoria tunnel, and how the wider transport system will operate with these improvements.”</blockquote>
      <p>“Improvements” being the planners’ way of describing road widening without using the word “widening”.</p>
      <p>Back in 2011, Andy Foster told the residents’ meeting he acknowledged that traffic growth was decreasing and alternative technologies were being developed. And he warned:</p>
      <blockquote>“The risk is that we are planning for business as it’s been for the last sixty years. What if it’s not the same?”</blockquote>
      <p>A question which is even more relevant today.</p>
      <p>After the meeting, a <a href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=36916">community group was set up to fight the plans</a> for building a motorway through the eastern suburbs. Its convenor said:</p>
      <blockquote>“The proposed roads will erode our quality of life in the Eastern suburbs and won’t relieve traffic congestion. People living within 200m – and this includes Kilbirnie School and the adjacent Playcentre – would be exposed to higher levels of pollution. Hataitai kindergarten will need to be moved. The edge of the Town Belt would be sliced off to make room for 6-8 lanes of traffic. After a few years, congestion from induced traffic means we would be back where we started – but $500 million poorer”</blockquote>
      <p>The Transport Agency, then as now, was unmoved. Two years later it confirmed that a second Mt Victoria Tunnel would require <a href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=56412">widening Ruahine Street</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>…the new proposals see a maximum of four lanes along the vast majority of Ruahine Street’s length</blockquote>
      <p>It released an illustration (above) showing that the extra lanes would take land from the Town Belt.</p>
      <p>And then in 2014, locals discovered that the Transport Agency was also <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/9610029/Lobbyists-wary-of-green-belt-park-link">planning to take part of Hataitai Park</a> for the road widening.</p>
      <blockquote>… it was likely the agency would need to encroach into Hataitai Park further than previously thought in order to accommodate new bus lanes… The bus lanes would be needed only if the region’s decision-makers decided to build a dedicated busway, rather than a light rail network.</blockquote>
      <p>A final decision was expected “in the next few months.” And that was six years ago. Before “Let’s Get Wellington Moving” had been thought of.</p>
      <p>The fact that none of the decisions has yet been made gives an opportunity to reconsider the need to widen two of Hataitai’s streets. Community opposition to the road widening is as strong as ever, as shown last year when <a href="http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=106708">the Mt Victoria Residents Association told the LGWM planners</a> why it strongly opposes a second Mt Victoria vehicle tunnel, the widening of Ruahine Street and Wellington Road, and the seizing of Town Belt land.</p>
