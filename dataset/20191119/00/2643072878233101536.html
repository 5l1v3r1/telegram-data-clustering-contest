      <p>Governor <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/14/obaseki-reveals-who-made-him-governor-says-its-not-oshiomhole/"><u><b>Godwin Obasek</b></u></a>i of Edo state has explained why none of the 18 local government councils of the state could pay salaries under his predecessor, <b>Adams Oshiomhole</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> learnt that the governor gave the revelation at Government House, in Benin City, during a visit by the team members of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College Study Tour Course 42.</p>
      <p>The governor who was represented at the meeting by the Secretary to the State Government, Barr. Osarodion Ogie, said the 18 local government councils of the state were owing salaries and pension entitlements at the time the<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/11/obaseki-sends-strong-message-to-oshiomole-over-2020-elections/"><u><b> national chairman of the APC</b> </u></a>left office as governor.</p>
      <p>He blamed the deployment of non-state actors as revenue collectors who deprived the government of revenue, for the indebtedness of the local government councils.</p>
      <p>The governor also said he would continue to demonstrate prudence in handling the state’s resources, paying salaries as and when due, among other laudable feats.</p>
      <p>He also added that his government is also assisting security outfits in the state to ensure they carry out their duties without much hassles in the state.</p>
      <p>He noted, “<i>When you see people talking of stomach infrastructure, it is a matter of choice. There are governors in the country who cannot pay salaries; but in this state, state workers get salaries every 26 of the month. It is because we have a leader who has decided to work for the benefit of the people.”</i></p>
