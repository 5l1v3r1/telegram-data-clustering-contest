      <p>India-focussed offshore funds and ETFs witnessed a net outflow of $1.4 billion (over Rs 9,900 crore) in July-September period of this year, making it the sixth consecutive quarter of withdrawal, a report has said. India-focussed offshore funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a subset of the overall foreign portfolio investor (FPI) flows.</p>
      <p>Of the total outflows during the quarter under review, $1 billion was from India-focussed offshore funds, while $321 million was from India-focussed offshore ETFs, Morningstar Offshore Fund Spy report said.</p>
      <p>In the previous quarter, the net outflow from offshore funds and ETFs was $941 million. Over the last one year period ended September 2019, the category has witnessed net outflows of $5.2 billion, it added.</p>
      <p>India-focussed offshore funds and ETFs registered outflows for the sixth consecutive quarter.</p>
      <p>During June 2018 quarter, the net outflow was pegged at $2,218.48 million, while it was $1,840.46 million in September 2018 quarter, $1,459.90 million in December 2018 quarter, $1,407.92 million in March 2019 quarter and $941.49 million in June 2019 quarter.</p>
      <p>"Consistent net outflows dented the asset base of India-focussed offshore funds and ETFs. During the quarter, their assets fell to $49.1 billion from $52.9 billion recorded in the previous quarter," the report said.</p>
      <p>As per the report, all three segments -- large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap -- performed negatively during the quarter ended September.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P BSE Sensex was down 1.85 per cent in September quarter, while S&amp;P BSE Midcap and S&amp;P BSE Smallcap indices were down 4.76 per cent and 7.50 per cent, respectively.</p>
      <p>The value of investment into Indian equities in foreign funds fell to an estimated $179 billion during the quarter ended September 2019 against $189 billion recorded in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>All three categories -- global, emerging market and Asia/Asia-Pacific -- of regionally diversified equity funds and ETFs turned out to be net sellers of Indian equities for the quarter under review, it said.</p>
