      <p>Sat Siri Akal ji!</p>
      <p>I hope you are doing great…  </p>
      <p>My name is Arjan Kaur and I’m Gurumustuk Singh’s wife. I’ve been behind the scenes supporting him and SikhNet since 1995 when SikhNet just started. He asked me to share how Guru Nanak is an inspiration to me, even 550 years after his passing. </p>
      <p>I’ve realized that I’m not one of those people who is going to open an orphanage or manage some big Seva project, and I’ve always felt sort of badly about that….that I’m not ‘doing enough’ to be a contribution to the planet.</p>

      <p>However, over the years, <b>I’m learning that my ‘job’ on this planet is to be present with those people right in front of me.</b> My job is to talk with the cashier in the grocery store, message a friend who may be feeling sad just to let them know that someone is thinking of them. I’m the person who is available to give a hug to a friend, co-worker or stranger because they’re having a hard day, week or year.</p>
      <p>And while this may not seem like it’s creating a big impact on the world, I’ve learned otherwise.</p>
      <p>When I was in Chiropractic School, I was in the hall, between classes, when a woman walked up to me and handed me an envelope full of cash.</p>
      <p>I was so surprised and looked at her with a question on my face. She told me that she’d been having a hard time in life and was feeling very down about a year ago. And one day she passed me in the hall and I had looked at her in the eyes and smiled at her.</p>
      <p><b>She said that the smile and the acknowledgment was so much that it lifted her out of the slump that she’d been experiencing. </b>She shared that she didn’t tithe (give 10% to a religious organization), but instead, when she would come into extra money, she donated to people. That person happened to be me that day. </p>
      <p>
        <b>That experience taught me that we can make big changes with our presence, our hearts, our smiles, and our generosity.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>We don’t have to ‘go big’ to share Guru Nanak’s teachings.</b> <b>We can learn from his example of being present and sharing our hearts.</b></p>
      <p>Something this simple does make an impact, and I hope that you, too, can find your ‘job’ in sharing more peace, more love, and more joy in your everyday world. </p>
      <p>This is part of SikhNet's work, too, and SikhNet is having their annual fundraiser right now. To do their job uplifting our Sikh Panth, they need to raise $300,000 by the end of December. <b>Help SikhNet carry on Guru Nanak’s mission of inclusion, love, and connection with God in everyone.</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://donate.sikhnet.com/?Source=19EmailGMSper1&amp;CID=103"><b>Will you take a minute right now and support the work of SikhNet with a donation of $31 or more?</b></a> </p>
      <p>Please support SikhNet in Guru’s service that supports so many in our changing world.</p>
      <p>With all my love from my family to yours.....</p>
