      <p>Head of the Planning Department at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Prof. Imoro Ibraimah, has joined persons who believe that the proposed introduction of a Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) in the basic school curriculum is an agenda being championed by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Society.</p>
      <p>Prof. Ibraimah’s comment comes even after government has debunked claims that the move was not backed by members of the LGBT community and President Akufo-Addo’s assurance that the values and culture of Ghanaians will not be destroyed with the introduction of the Comprehensive Sexuality Education into Ghana’s Educational System.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a public policy dialogue organized by the Progressive Intellectuals at the University of Ghana, Prof. Ibraimah indicated that the LGBT had captured almost all the United Nation agencies and were using the media to also promote their agenda.</p>
      <p>CSE is an agenda being promoted by the LGBT community. They have to capture almost all the UN agencies and including the media and they are pursuing their agenda and one of that is the Comprehensive Sexuality Education.</p>
      <p>The Comprehensive Sexuality Education is in two ways. One is through public schools by targeting the youth in educational institutions and the other is through Civil Society Organizations and the media,” he added.</p>
      <p>Professor Imoro Ibraimah also accused the LGBT society of attempting to compromise the laws of the country as their means of gratifying their sexual desires was unacceptable in Ghana.</p>
      <p>In Ghana, sexuality is governed by law and our law says unnatural canal knowledge is against the law. They are forcing us repeal the law so that when a man wants to sleep with a man through the anus, it should be allowed.</p>
      <p>We in developing countries say that right development is what we should pursue….they [LGBT society] is looking for the right to sex and that is the CSE approach.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>The planned integration of the Comprehensive Sexuality Education in the basic school curriculum has generated mixed reactions from the public with some suggesting that the course is a backdoor attempt to introduce children to LGBT issues.</p>
      <p>Others have suggested that the material be limited to pupils in Junior High Schools.</p>
      <p>Despite clarification from bodies such as the Ghana Education Service that the curriculum has nothing to do with “LGBT issues, masturbation or explicit display/labeling of intimate body parts” and insisted that the education is meant to inculcate relevant values into pupils, many have vehemently challenged the position, insisting that it is an attempted to propagate sexuality education that does not reflect that values and norms of the Ghanaian society.</p>
