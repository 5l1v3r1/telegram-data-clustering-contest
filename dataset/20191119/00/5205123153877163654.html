      <p>She was left with a string of shocking injuries in the wake of the attack including a large slash wound to the back, the Irish Independent reports.</p>
      <p>The brave teen incurred the injuries after defending her 11-month-old cousin from the attack. She has received around 300 stitches since then.</p>
      <p>Three men reportedly forced their way into a house on Trasna Way, Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh, at around 9pm on Saturday before carrying out the attack.</p>
      <p>The young teen’s grandmother, 41-year-old Elizabeth Joyce was targeted in the attack and has been received treatment for the injuries she incurred.</p>
      <p>Her young niece is being treated at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen with her condition is said to be critical but stable.</p>
      <p>Ms Joyce described the attack in terrifying detail to <i><b>ITV</b></i>: "They burst through the house, one attacker came to me attacking. I was screaming and kicking and fighting back.</p>
      <p>“The other attacker went for the wee fella, but his auntie, who is in hospital in a very critical condition, she threw herself on top of the baby to save the baby's life."</p>
      <p>The PSNI are now appealing for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>PSNI Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said: “This must have been a terrifying ordeal for those involved and we are determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>“We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time, but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on.”</p>
      <p>According to reports, the family involved belongs to the Travelling community.</p>
      <p>There is some media speculation that the attack could be connected to a long-running dispute.</p>
      <p>The PSNI investigation is ongoing.</p>
