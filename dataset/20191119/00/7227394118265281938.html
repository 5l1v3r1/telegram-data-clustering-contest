      <h1>Huawei Mate 30 Pro officially makes its way to Europe, sortof</h1>

      <p>Huawei’s <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/res.php3?sSearch=mate+30+">Mate 30 lineup</a> was announced back in September but remained confined to China and a select group of Asian markets. Now, the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_30_pro-9885.php">Mate 30 Pro</a> has officially arrived on European shores with Spain being the first country to get the latest Huawei flagship. There is still no word if the vanilla <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_30-9886.php">Mate 30</a> or <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_30_rs_porsche_design-9887.php">Porsche Design</a> variant will also make their way to Europe though.</p>

      <p>The catch is that the Mate 30 Pro is available in limited quantities only at the Huawei Space Store in Madrid. The phone is going for €1,099 in its 8GB RAM and 256GB storage configuration and is only available in the Space Silver colorway.</p>
      <p>There is also a hot launch promotion, which includes a €299 check that can be used towards other Huawei products. This offer is valid through December 9.</p>
      <p>While this is a pretty sweet deal, the Mate 30 Pro is still lacking Google Mobile Services, which makes it a tough sell anywhere outside China.
