      <p>The employment growth in the country has slowed down in the last two years, to 3.9 per cent in 2017-18 and 2.8 per cent in 2018-19 as the core industries have witnessed virtually, a negative growth in hiring, according to a study.</p>
      <p>"In terms of growth in employment on an annual basis, it was 2.5 per cent in 2015-16, 4.1 per cent in 2016-17 and 3.9 per cent and 2.8 per cent in 2017-18 and 2018-19, respectively. Hence, there has been a slowdown in growth in the last 2 years after a sharp recovery in 2016-17," according to a study by Care Ratings.</p>
      <p>The study is based on a set of 1,938 companies spread across all sectors.</p>
      <p>The study revealed that aggregate headcount increased at 3.3 per cent annually between 2014-15 and 2018-19, that is over a four-year period.</p>
      <p>Ideally, it observed that the rate of growth in employment should link with growth in gross domestic product (GDP), which is the broadest indicator of economic growth.</p>
      <p>However, employment growth has not been commensurate with GDP growth with a difference of 4.2 per cent in CAGR during this period.</p>
      <p>The top 10 sectors covering 895 companies with employment of 4.70 million in 2018-19 accounted for three fourth of the total employment of the sample companies.</p>
      <p>Of this 42.4 per cent employment share was from three service industries while the balance was from manufacturing (30 per cent) and agriculture (3 per cent).</p>
      <p>Overall the share of employment in services is around 50 per cent, it added.</p>
      <p>Sector-wise, the study revealed that the core industries have witnessed virtually negative growth in headcount, with crude oil just about maintaining the employment level.</p>
      <p>These industries have been impacted by the slowdown in GDP growth as well as the challenges on the NPA side for banks.</p>
      <p>A similar picture is witnessed for the heavy industries where growth has tended to be negative for power and capital goods and just 0.4 per cent for infra.</p>
      <p>However, the consumer-oriented industries showed a varied pattern, like in the agricultural and durable goods there has been a deceleration in employment while there has been an increase for FMCG and textiles albeit at a lower than sample average of 3.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>The manufacturing had witnessed fairly good growth in employment with 5 of the 8 industries registering higher than sample growth in employment.</p>
      <p>Two sectors have witnessed negative growth, that is paper and gems and jewellery, while chemicals recorded growth of just 1.6 per cent.</p>
      <p>Healthcare and automobiles have registered a healthy growth of 4.8 per cent in employment, which is quite impressive.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the financial sector's performance has by far been most impressive with banks, NBFCs and insurance witnessing impressive growth.</p>
      <p>The highest growth was in the NBFC segment, which has added more from 2016-17 onwards as the sector also witnessed sharp growth in business.</p>
      <p>In the non-financial sector segment, the IT and retail industries have registered near or above-average growth.</p>
      <p>However, telecom, hospitality and realty witnessed negative growth reflecting the state of the industry.</p>
      <p>The telecom industry has been through upheavals which have led to several mergers that have impacted headcount.</p>
