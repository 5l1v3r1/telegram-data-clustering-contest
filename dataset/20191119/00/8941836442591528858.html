      <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - A fishing boat caught fire in South Korea’s southern waters early Tuesday, killing at least one fisherman and triggering a search for 11 others missing, coast guard officials said.</p>
      <p>Rescue workers found one of the fishermen unconscious in waters 7.4 kilometers (4.6 miles) south of the boat and airlifted him to a hospital on the nearby island of Jeju where he was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>The coast guard and navy were deploying boats, helicopters and a patrol plane to search the waters near the island for survivors, said Lee Geun-han, an official from the coast guard in Jeju. Six of the boat’s crew members are South Koreans, including the man killed, and the other six are Vietnamese, Lee said.</p>
      <p>Rescue efforts, which also involved civilian fishing vessels, were being slowed by strong winds and large waves in the area.</p>
      <p>Lee said the coast guard received a report about the fire at around 7 a.m. A coast guard helicopter found the boat about an hour later, and the upper side of the vessel had been burned completely.</p>

      <p>Photos released by the coast guard showed the 29-ton boat engulfed in black smoke.</p>
      <p>The fishing boat departed from the mainland port of Tongyeong on Nov. 8 to catch hairtail and had planned to return to the port on Monday.</p>
