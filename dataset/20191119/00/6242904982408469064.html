        <b>Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton has lauded Dutch-born Ghanaian defender Jeremie Frimpong for his impressive start to life in Scotland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Frimpong, who joined the Scottish giants from Manchester City, has been a revelation. The 18-year-old has commanded three first-team appearances and has a goal and an assist.</p>
      <p>“You’d think professional football was quite an easy game the way youngster Frimpong has started his career in a Celtic jersey with really good attacking intent," Sutton, who works as a pundit for BBC Sport and BT Sport said. He, however, claimed; "we haven’t seen him seriously tested defensively."</p>
      <p>Frimpong born in Amsterdam could represent Ghana in future despite featuring Dutch youth teams.</p>
