      <h1>PS5 “DualShock 5” Controller Design Revealed Through Patents</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Marco Cocomello</a></address>
      <p>Sony has filed the patents for the PS5 DualShock 5 controller which could reveal what the device will look like when the console is released this time next year. According to the <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/?uri=/c1800/DE/JP-2019-005960/0A493D7BB9C01BA4712B57A8318A7208A68420EF54F725A2D4AC928C7B752081/30/ja">Japanese Patent Office</a>, the Dualshock 5 looks very much the same as the PS4 controller with a few tweaks here and there pointing to an internal overhaul.</p>

      <p>The new controller will feature larger triggers, smaller thumbsticks, a USB port and no light bar. The controller’s buttons will also stick out more compared to the DualShock 4 and have a USB Type-C charging port instead of the Micro USB one found in the DS4.</p>
      <p>While we can’t see the physical change, the DualShock 5 is said to feature adaptive triggers that offer a variety of pressure resistance levels depending on the game you are playing. The controller is also said to contain a new vibration motor called “haptic feedback” that will deliver shorter and more precise kickbacks compared to the vibration we all know now.</p>

      <p>As for the touchpad, according to reports from early this year, the DualShock 5 on the PS4 was going to feature a touch screen on the controller. The patent could include it but due to it being a diagram, it looks like just any boring old touchpad. However, the touch screen has yet to be confirmed by Sony or anyone who has had their hands-on with the device up to this point.</p>
      <p>Of course, this is just a patent and things could drastically change before the controller and the PS5 is unveiled next year.</p>
      <p>Let us know what you think about this controller’s design down in the comments section below.</p>
