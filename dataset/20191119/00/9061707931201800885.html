      <p>On their tenth anniversary, a group of friends from Spondon have celebrated raising over £8,800 for local charity <a href="https://www.treetopshospice.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItfGMy9jz5QIVibHtCh0vkAbzEAAYASAAEgJR2fD_BwE">Treetops Hospice Care</a>.</p>
      <p>Spondon Friends started raising money for the hospice in 2009 from organising events, garden parties, attending summer and Christmas fairs to one member even doing a tandem parachute jump!</p>
      <p>Spondon Friends chair, Jean Tunnock, explained how the group began.</p>
      <p>“I’d been working in a Derby school for over twenty years supporting children with special educational needs, so when I retired in 2009, I was looking for something to help fill the void.</p>
      <p>“I met the community fundraiser for <a href="https://www.treetopshospice.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItfGMy9jz5QIVibHtCh0vkAbzEAAYASAAEgJR2fD_BwE">Treetops</a> at the time and she introduced me to the recently formed 'Spondon Friends of <a href="https://www.treetopshospice.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItfGMy9jz5QIVibHtCh0vkAbzEAAYASAAEgJR2fD_BwE">Treetops Hospice Care</a>'.</p>
      <p>“Over the past ten years, we have raised money by holding Spring Fayres and Christmas Markets in the village hall and we have also increased awareness of the services provided by Treetops by attending events held by other associations.</p>
      <p>“We have held talks and quizzes in the Parish Room at St Werburgh’s Church and I’ve particularly enjoyed these occasions as the members of our group had a chance to socialise, while at the same time raise money for <a href="https://www.treetopshospice.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItfGMy9jz5QIVibHtCh0vkAbzEAAYASAAEgJR2fD_BwE">Treetops</a>.</p>
      <p>“I greatly enjoy being part of Spondon Friends and I would encourage anyone to get involved.”</p>
      <p>Friends’ member, Jackie Annable, also volunteers on reception at the hospice, based in Risley.</p>
      <p>“I started volunteering at Treetops about seven year ago as my daughter- in-law was a Treetops Hospice at Home nurse at that time, so it seemed a natural thing to do when I was looking to volunteer somewhere. I joined Spondon Friends around about the same time.</p>
      <p>“I enjoy the contact I have with other volunteers, members of staff and of course the many patients and their families who come through our doors. I feel that everyone who visits Treetops, or uses our services, finds a very welcoming atmosphere, which hopefully the receptionists contribute to.</p>
      <p>“I think that the services we provide for our patients helps to lighten their day and give them an opportunity to meet other people in similar circumstances, and of course allows their family or carers to have some time to call their own.”</p>
      <p>Claire Baxter, community fundraising lead, congratulated the group on their amazing achievement.</p>
      <p>“Spondon Friends are always a pleasure to work with and have a wealth of experience between them. They are always eager to help and raise funds at local fairs and fetes raising a wonderful amount over the years.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank them all for their dedication and support to <a href="https://www.treetopshospice.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItfGMy9jz5QIVibHtCh0vkAbzEAAYASAAEgJR2fD_BwE">Treetops Hospice Care</a> and look forward to working with them for many more years.”</p>
