      <p>When you think about it, Houston-based Hilcorp is exactly the kind of company you would expect to be the successor to BP on Alaska’s North Slope. With the massive Prudhoe Bay field having long ago reach its peak level of production and settled into a long-term phase of decline, it was inevitable that the major, integrated companies who discovered it and managed it through its first 40-plus years of production would eventually reach a point at which it makes more sense within their respective business plans to sell operations there and focus capital budgets on multiple other opportunities around the globe.Whenever majors enter into the divesting phase of their mature assets, they typically are acquired by large independent producers, companies with the capitalization needed to enable them to take over such major assets. Few U.S. independents are larger or as well-capitalized as Hilcorp, and fewer still have Hilcorp’s strong track record of taking over mature fields and deploying innovative techniques to wring higher production from them and improve their operations.</p>
      <p>Hilcorp is a big company with operations in nine U.S. states, including Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Wyoming and in Alaska, where it has operated since 2012 and established a history of innovative and safe operations. As former Alaska Natural Resources Commissioner John Shively told me, “Before Hilcorp came into the Cook Inlet, we felt that we might have to import LNG into South Central Alaska to keep our homes heated. And they completely turned that around.”</p>
      <p>Hilcorp began its Cook Inlet operations in 2012 <a href="https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/companies/article/17266305/hilcorp-to-acquire-chevrons-cook-inlet-assets">via an acquisition</a> of mature assets from Chevron. It later added to its holdings there in 2013 with <a href="https://www.alaskajournal.com/business-and-finance/2013-02-14/hilcorp-closes-marathon-sale-turns-inlet-gas">another acquisition</a>, this time of Marathon’s assets in the Inlet. According to a <a href="https://www.aoga.org/sites/default/files/news/cook_inlet_fact_sheet_final.pdf">fact sheet</a> from the Alaska Oil and Gas Association (AOGA), in 2014 alone, Hilcorp worked over 88 existing wells and drilled 22 new Cook Inlet wells. The Energy Information Administration reports that <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=AK">natural gas generated 43%</a> of the state’s electricity during 2017. None of the gas had to be imported as LNG.</p>
      <p>While so many other large independents have moved full-bore into the shale boom, making it the focus of their operations, Hilcorp has become the industry’s leading contrarian, employing this same model of purchasing mature assets and enhancing production in previously-declining conventional fields around the country. Given the scope of its operations in the lower 48 states, Hilcorp probably operates more wells than any other producer in North America.</p>
      <p>There is no reason to believe that the company can’t achieve similar results once its Prudhoe Bay acquisition from BP is fully approved and finalized. In addition to its success in the Cook Inlet, the company has also clearly demonstrated its ability to fund and execute in its pre-existing major operations on the North Slope and in the Beaufort Sea. After a long period of steady production decline from the Prudhoe Bay field, there is every reason for Alaskans to have confidence that Hilcorp will be able to arrest and potentially reverse that trend to some extent through the deployment of this same innovative operational model.</p>
      <p>As Shively notes, “They’ve operated on the Slope, so they have some experience up there now, so I think they’ve proved themselves in Alaska. And getting a company that seems to be good at finding new oil in existing fields is pretty phenomenal, and really a good thing for the state.”</p>
      <p>But not everyone in Alaska is so happy about the deal, particularly activists groups who oppose fossil fuels in general. They have adopted a novel line of attack targeting Hilcorp that keys on its status as a privately-held company which is not subject to SEC filing requirements to which corporate entities must comply, mounting a campaign to pressure Alaska regulators to force the company to release its past and current financial records.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2019/11/10/hilcorp-wants-finances-kept-private-in-alaska-deal-with-bp-leading-to-calls-for-transparency/">November 11 article</a>, the Anchorage Daily News reported that some “…Alaskans are calling for greater financial transparency from Hilcorp, the privately owned company seeking to buy BP’s North Slope assets, in part to ensure it has the financial muscle to respond to a potentially costly accident if the deal goes through.”</p>
      <p>But if that is really the concern, it becomes well-addressed by regulators at both the state and federal levels, as Hilcorp will be required to provide proof of its financial ability to fund the oil spill response plan it is required by law to put into place. The company must also provide proof of financial stability related to state and federal bonding requirements. While the records filed in these instances are not subject to public disclosure, if these activist groups don’t trust the regulators to do their jobs, then they cannot be satisfied in any event.</p>
      <p>That sort of opposition is tactic is the kind of thing any operator in Alaska must be prepared to deal with. Hilcorp has already dealt with it for the past seven years, and, assuming the deal with BP is ultimately approved, will be dealing with it for many years to come.</p>
