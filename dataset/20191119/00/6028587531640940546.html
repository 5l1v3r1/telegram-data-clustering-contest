      <p>On November 26, the Dallas Mavericks are going to wear their 2019-20 City edition uniforms for the first time and judging from the initial reaction to the uniforms, this may not be a night to look forward to when it comes to the jerseys that the home team will be wearing on that particular night. In addition to announcing the date for the new uniforms, the Mavericks also released images of the uniform. This uniform will very likely go down as one of the more memorable alternate uniforms to be released since Nike has taken over uniform duties with the NBA – which is saying something when you consider the sheer number of alternate looks that have been released since Nike came onto the scene.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the uniforms may end up being memorable for all of the wrong reasons. Here’s a look at the uniforms and hopefully you are sitting down for this one:</p>
      <p>Well, let’s start with the positives. It’s always nice to see the Mavericks embrace green as a color. In fact, the color scheme of those particular shades of blue and green are vibrant and really bring life to the uniform. Maybe in an alternate universe where slightly different decisions were made, the Mavericks would be hailed for delivering one of the better City edition uniforms of this particular season.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we have to address the elephant in the room. The script logo is atrocious. The obvious “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98k05_bM2e4">How do you do, fellow kids?</a>” joke has been made countless times already but it’s still very fitting for this situation. It’s actually admirable that the Mavericks would do their best to put street artists in the spotlight with the aforementioned November 26 date being dubbed <a href="https://www.mavs.com/city/">“Art and Basketball” Night</a> at their arena. However, this just comes off as being really contrived and forced instead of being genuinely inspired.</p>
      <p>Back when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/demetriusbell/2019/10/03/brooklyn-nets-take-it-to-the-streets-with-new-statement-uniform/#65260d3c70f3">the Nets revealed their Statement uniform for this season</a>, the design was well-executed and nothing about it came off as uninspired or bland. As a result, the Nets ended up coming out with a look that was fitting for their brand and also stood out in a good way. The graffiti-inspired uniform for Brooklyn actually came off as authentic, while the look for Dallas came off as a bit generic. It’s actually a bit disappointing since the street artist that Dallas linked up with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/texmoton/?hl=en">has much better work in his portfolio</a>. Tex Moton has worked with the Mavericks in the past and even then, that particular work came off looking better than what was revealed with this uniform.</p>
      <p>If the City edition uniform followed the design clue of what’s on display at the Mavericks’ headquarters, then this actually would have worked out a lot better. Instead, the ugly wordmark is what the Mavericks ended up going with and it’s a real shame. Street art uniforms can be done correctly (as the Nets proved) but this is an example of what happens when this style of uniform goes wrong.</p>
      <p>The good news is that we won’t have to see them past this season, since uniforms like this are typically around for only a season. However, it’ll be a memorable one since it’ll go down as one of those uniforms that you think of when you try to come up with the uglier basketball uniforms in the history of the NBA.</p>
