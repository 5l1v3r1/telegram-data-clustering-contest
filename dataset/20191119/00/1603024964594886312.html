      <p>"The Indian rupee opened lower at 71.97 a dollar, tacking cues from most Asian currencies as a lack of progress in US-China trade talks had an impact on risk appetite.</p>
      <p>However, the rupee recovered from day's low amid stronger domestic equity and lower crude oil prices," said V K Sharma, Head - PCG &amp; Capital Market Strategy, HDFC securities.</p>
      <p>Sharma further said that the rupee expected to trade with a bearish bias given global uncertainty and slower domestic growth.</p>
