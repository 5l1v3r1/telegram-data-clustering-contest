      <p>AirAsia India onÂ November 19 said it is entering into a partnership with health technology start-up Mfine to provide pollution masks to its passengers taking flights to Delhi from Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Kolkata.</p>
      <p>The initiative is being taken in view of high pollution levels in Delhi, the airline said, adding that PM 2.5 particles can "reach deep into the lungs".</p>
      <p>PM 2.5 are tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter.</p>

      <p>"The campaign will commence on November 19, 2019, and end on November 29, 2019," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In the winters, there is a dip in the minimum temperature that makes the air cold and heavy, making it easier for accumulation of pollutants close to the ground, the airline said.</p>
      <p>"This tie up with Mfine is intended to help guests cope with changing environmental conditions in the city and stay healthy," it said.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
