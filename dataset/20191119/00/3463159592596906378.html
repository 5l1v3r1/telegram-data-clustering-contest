      <p>Côte d'Ivoire and Egypt became the first two teams from Africa to qualify for the Men's Olympic Football Tournament Tokyo 2020 after booking their place in the final of the CAF U-23 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>The Young Elephants of Côte d'Ivoire kicked the day off in Cairo by defeating fellow West Africans Ghana 3-2 on penalties after the semi-final finished 2-2 after extra time.</p>
      <p>Youssouf Dao scored a brace for Côte d'Ivoire with a goal in either half, while Ghana midfielder Evans Mensah forced the match into extra time with a stoppage-time equaliser after Yaw Yeboah had equalised for The Black Meteors early in the second half. Eliezer Ira Tape was the hero in the penalty shootout, saving three Ghanian spot kicks to send his side into the final and secure a ticket to Tokyo 2020, which will be the nation's first appearance at the Men's Olympic Football Tournament since Beijing 2008.</p>

      <p>In the evening's final game, hosts Egypt sealed their Tokyo 2020 qualification thanks to star man Ramadan Sobhi, who converted an early second-half penalty, and Abdelrahman Magdy's late brace.</p>
      <p>After a goalless first half, Sobhi and Magdy's late double put the result beyond doubt to get the Cairo crowd thinking about travel plans to Tokyo next year.</p>
      <p>The winner in the match for third place on 22 November between Ghana and South Africa will secure Africa's third and final ticket to Tokyo.</p>
