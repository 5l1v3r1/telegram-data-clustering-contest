      <p>The U.K. Green Party has launched its 2019 manifesto. The 92-page <a href="https://campaigns.greenparty.org.uk/manifesto/"><i>If Not Now, When?</i></a> sets out the polices the party would introduce should it win the December General Election. The party pledges to spend an extra £141.5bn a year as part of its Green New Deal to bring carbon emissions to net zero by 2030.On transport, the party pledges to scrap the High Speed 2 rail line and use the money for smaller-scale transport projects instead. Speed limits for motorists would be reduced and there would be new taxes on petrol, diesel, shipping and air fuel.</p>
      <p>The Green Party pledge to spend £2.5 billion a year on woodchip and sawdust cycleways and footpaths has been ridiculed on social media by advocates of active-travel, who say such surface treatments quickly degrade and become impassable.</p>
      <p><i>If Not Now, When?</i> is light on detail, but it’s probable that the idea for woodchip and sawdust surfaces is based on trials carried out in The Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The Dutch city of Emmen installed a cycleway made out of recycled wood in 2017. Paving slabs were formed from wood chips held in place by organic resin.</p>
      <p>Grontmij, the transport consultancy behind the project, used waste product from sawmills. The wood and resin surfacing is expected to have a working life at least as long as asphalt, believes the company.</p>
      <p>Grontmij’s Rudi van Hedel told Dutch magazine <a href="https://www.cobouw.nl/infra/nieuws/2016/01/houten-fietspad-ecodynamisch-verlicht-101245825?_ga=2.64372399.1254677291.1574184704-49928186.1574184704"><i>Cobouw</i></a> that the wood-and-resin slabs are far greener than other materials:</p>
      <p>“The biocomposite materials [we use] are less damaging to the environment to produce. They’re green resources so they contribute to a bio-based economy.”</p>
      <p>The first 200-meter stretch of experimental cycleway was laid by construction company <a href="https://www.sweco.nl/nieuws/nieuwsartikelen/persbericht-eerste-biocomposieten-fietspad-van-nederland/">Sweco</a> in July 2017.</p>
      <p>The trial section is made up of six parts, each with a different composition and top layer. The results of the test will be revealed later this year.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands is at the forefront of trialling eco cycleways. In 2016 the city of Leeuwarden made a cycleway made from (very) recycled toilet paper. And, in Amsterdam, there’s a cycleway constructed from waste glass and elephant grass.</p>
