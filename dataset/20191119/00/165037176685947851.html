      <h1>What Robert said in September about a possible Luis Enrique return</h1>

        <b>On 3rd September almost 3 months after he was appointed manager, Robert Moreno publically assured that is Luis Enrique wanted to return as manager, he would step down.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Now there is a very recent situation that must be respected. <b>There are three press conferences that I wouldn't have liked to do</b>. The Malta press conference, my first one as manager and this Monday's one. I consider Luis a friend and he has to be ahead of any project in life. If given the moment he decides that he wants to come back<b> I will be the first, and be delighted, to take a step to the side </b>and work with him again," Robert Moreno said. "Friends are ahead of any project," he added.</p>
      <p>At that time, Luis Enrique had lost his daughter Xana is August. In June, he left the role as Spain boss due to her illness and R<b>obert Moreno, with his support, took charge</b>. He was his assistant at Spain and Barcelona.</p>
      <p>These words from Robert Moreno, in a way, clash with the reaction of the still-boss when he learned that he would not be staying as Spain manager. He didn't give press conferences after beating Romania, didn't talk to the tv companies, got the news wrong and, according to various sources, feels "betrayed". In the days leading up to the non-renewal of his contract, Robert rated his job as Spain manager a "<b>10/10</b>".</p>

      <p>Beyond the forms of the Real Federación Española (RFEF) and Luis Rubiales, Robert's statements two and a half months ago make him a prisoner of the newspapers and put him in the firing range as he achieved his target of making Euro 2020.</p>
