      <h3>Citizenship (Amendment) Bill</h3>
      <p>In the Winter Session, the government aims to pave way for the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, which had lapsed in the last Parliament session following the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. Under the bill, the legislation seeks to grant Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan if they have fled their respective country due to religious persecution. The Bill amends the Citizenship Act 1955.</p>
