      <p>"I will go on garden leave today until my contract ends early next year. It has been my honor to work with an incredible talented team in building Viveport into a global destination for VR experiences."</p>
      <p>Replacing Steiber for the time being is HTC's VP of product, Bjorn Book-Larsson, who'll step up as the acting head of Viveport.</p>
