      <h1>A bad road haunts commuters at tech corridor in Bengaluru</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Kumaran P</a></address>
      <p>Techies, who stay in and around Ramamurthynagar, are wary of venturing out of their homes as the commute on the roads in the area is something they prefer to avoid. Ramamurthy Nagar and TC Palya are among the most preferred areas for techies. But the roads in these areas are a disgrace. BM reader Srikant Pandillapalli who works as a technical architect in a software company says he has been trying in vain to get the road repaired for months now. Residents say that for the last four months the road has been in a pathetic condition. <br/><br/>The road has been dug up numerous times in the past by BWSSB and BBMP. Pandillapalli narrates how he met with an accident on the road. <br/><br/>“I was travelling towards office and lost control over my bike due to the poor condition of the road. I fell and was injured. Since then, I have been sending numerous mails and petitions to BBMP and BWSSB but there is no response. I have even tried to contact the local engineers but they are hardly bothered. My only concern is that no one else should face a similar problem. However, there seems to be no one in the civic agency to listen.”</p>

      <p>–Srikanth Pandillapalli<br/><br/>Rajesh M, another techie residing in the area, said, “As the KR Puram flyover is always clogged, we take this road to reach Hoodi via internal roads. <br/><br/><br/>However, after taking this road, we realise that it is better to get stuck in a traffic jam at KR Puram flyover rather than going through here. This road is surely among the worst in Bengaluru if not in India. I don’t know why BBMP is not interested in repairing this road at all.”</p>
