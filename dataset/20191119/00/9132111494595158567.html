      <p>Private legal practitioner and the Director of the Human Rights and Governance Centre (HRGC), Martin Kpebu is charging the National Peace Council to engage leaders of a supposed secessionist group in the Volta Region, also known as the Homeland Study Group.</p>
      <p>The group on Saturday purportedly declared independence from Ghana saying, the territory is now called Western Togoland State.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Citi News, Mr. Kpebu said, the National Peace Council should prioritize meeting with the leadership of the group to possibly abort their mission.</p>
      <p>“With the way things are going, I think that perhaps the Peace Council should be brought in, to engage them because the way the laws work, if we are not careful, the State can decide to prosecute them. This is the second time they are doing this. You know, with the first one, the State left it because they are not a very big group,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If it was a big group that was threatening our national security, of course, I will have said they should be prosecuted. The mediation is not kids gloves and we just want to be sure that we have done everything within our power to give them the right education, so that, if beyond that they exist, and in the future the State is prosecuting them, I am sure people will not have any sympathy,” he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the separatist movement in the Volta Region, the Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF), called for the secession of the area which includes Volta through to parts of the Upper East region from Ghana.</p>
      <p>The group claims that the area was an independent State before being made to join Ghana in a plebiscite.</p>
      <p>The leader of the group, Mr. Charles Kormi Kudzodzi – popularly known as Papa Hogbedetor, was arrested with seven others when they first declared their intent at one of the group’s regular study meetings.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, government has slammed the group’s supposed declaration of ‘Western Togoland’ as an independent State.</p>
      <p>It guaranteed that security agencies are taking the necessary measures to ensure all persons involved with the Homeland Study foundation’s planned separation from Ghana are made to face the law.</p>
