You’ll find something on this list of the best gifts for hikers and backpackers for everyone, from light weekend hikers to adventurers who spend more time sleeping in a tent than a bed.

The hiking industry today has expanded to include high-tech gear, completely waterproof clothing and ultra-light comforts of home that won’t weigh down a pack. Fortunately, there’s so much camping and hiking gear on the market that it’s easy to find both something your giftee can use on the trails <i>and </i>something that won’t break your gift-buying budget.</p>

      <p>If you know a camper who refuses to compromise on quality coffee, consider gifting him or her a luxury coffee set sure to make even a professional barista jealous. This kit comes with everything needed to make pour-overs, espressos and more. If the price tag is a bit too high, the kettle, grinder, and drip system are available separately, too. The kit comes in a cotton storage bag and scores rave reviews for consistently tasty coffee. For a cheaper option for backpackers counting every gram, consider a box of Alpine Start Instant Coffee instead as a welcome stocking stuffer; each pack weighs only .1 oz. You could even toss in a few <a href="https://www.honeystinger.com/products/organic-waffles/waffles">Honey Stinger Waffles</a> – sweet, organic waffles that pair well with coffee and won’t get smushed in a hiking pack.</p>

      <p>Hikers know how harsh bright light can be on the eyes, which is why a pair of dependable sunglasses is a must. Treat the hiker or backpacker in your life to a pair of high-end, scratch-resistant, lightweight shades, like the Sampan frame from Costa. The square frame is flattering on all face shapes and the high-tech lenses cut down on haze and enhance sharpness to prevent eye strain during all-day adventures. They’re also polarized and reduce glare, preventing eye fatigue (and potentially headaches) when it’s time to set up camp for the evening after a long hike. For a more affordable option, try the Anhingas from Rheos. The floating sunglasses are polarized, offer complete UV protection and come with a lifetime warranty.</p>

      <p>Know someone who never has anyone to backpack with? Solve the problem for them by treating them to an REI Adventure. The affordable trips start at three days long and will pair your giftee with other hikers and backpackers to explore some of the U.S.’s most appealing outdoor destinations. Women’s-specific hiking and backpacking trips are available, and since all trips are led by expert guides, you can rest easy knowing your friend or family member is hiking with the assistance of safe and knowledgable professionals.</p>

      <p>Choosing the right backpack for someone else can be tricky since getting the perfect fit can make or break a multi-day hike. Fortunately, the Blaze 60 packs from Granite Gear have completely removable hip belts, adding an extra adjustment point to help backpackers find the perfect fit. And if the torso is too long, the straps can be adjusted to better fit around the shoulders in several different spots. The Blaze 60 comes in both women’s and unisex options and weighs in at an ultra-light three pounds, which may be part of the reason it won rave reviews from the gear testing pros at Backpacker Magazine.</p>

      <p>Treat your giftee’s feet to a pair of all-season hiking boots. The Arctic 600 boots from Danner are completely waterproof, making them ideal for hikers who often encounter snow, rain or mud on the trails. They’re insulated to keep feet warm and since they have an extra-grippy outsole, they help reduce slips and falls on wet trails or slick rocks. These boots score points for being extra comfortable for extended wear, thanks to their supportive (and removable) footbeds. Both laced and slip-on versions are available for men and women.</p>

      <p>Most hikers already have a few performance layers in their closets, but the Rhythm Tee could replace them all. The ultra-soft shirt is extremely lightweight and made of a high-tech merino wool blend that’s stronger and quicker drying than traditional merino. Because it controls body temperature so well, it’s ideal for a variety of cardio sports beyond just hiking. It’s made with responsibly sourced wool and can be worn several times before it develops an odor or needs washed, ideal for hikers and backpackers on the trail for days (or weeks) at a time.</p>

      <p>Give the gift of always being able to take a photo, even on multi-day backcountry adventures. The LifeActív Power Pack 10 provides between two and four complete battery charges for the average cell phone. And since it’s Qi-enabled, it charges most modern phones wirelessly without the need to carry a cable. It weighs in at just 8.8 ounces, or about half a pound, making it lighter weight than most other battery chargers with equal storage.</p>

      <p>After a day of hiking, slipping on a pair of comfortable shoes for the evening is practically a must. But weight counts for backpackers, so carrying a pair of heavy hiking sandals or durable flip flops can sometimes be impossible. Enter the Vivobarefoot Ultra Bloom, a comfortable shoe that weighs just 1/3 of a pound. The shoes bend to fit in the tiniest of extra spaces and because they’re quick-drying, they can be used for stream crossings to avoid taking on water in heavy hiking boots. Vivobarefoot uses sustainable algae-based foam to make several styles for <a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/mens/active/primus-lite-mens-ow5?colour=Obsidian">men</a> and women, all of which are among the lightest water shoes on the market.</p>

      <p>Nearly every backpacker already has a headlamp, but sometimes you need extra light at camp for cooking, exploring or playing cards by the fire. Though it weighs just half a pound, the PackLite Max 2-in-1 charger provides 150 lumens of light and acts as a solar charger for phones and other small devices. It collapses for easy packing, is weather- and waterproof and recharges itself when left out in the sun. It’s a lot of cool technology packed into one reasonably priced product.</p>
