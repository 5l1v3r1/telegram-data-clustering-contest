      <p>He said: “Corporate Fleets are currently managing the complexity that comes from the inevitable transition to electric vehicles and are looking for trusted and experienced partners that can provide support and advice.</p>
      <p>“I’m really excited to be joining the brand that has the most experience in selling electric vehicles to fleets in the UK, and looking forward to working with the Nissan leadership team, dealer network and supplier base to simplify this complexity and accelerate this change for customers.”</p>

      <p>Under his stewardship, Seat was named most improved fleet manufacturer of the year in the 2018 Fleet News Awards.</p>
