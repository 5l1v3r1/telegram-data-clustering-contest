      <p>The Court of Appeal on Tuesday affirmed the victory of Emeka Ihedioha as Imo State governor.<br/><br/>Ihedioha, who represented the Peoples Democratic Party in the keenly contested March 9 governorship election in the state, is being challenged by candidates of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (Ifeanyi Ararume); Action Alliance (Uche Nwosu) and that of the All Progressive Congress (Hope Uzodinma).</p>
      <p>The appellants are asking the court to void the election of Ihedioha on grounds that he did not obtain the constitutional one quarter of votes in at least two-thirds of the 27 local government areas of the state, in line with Section 179 of the constitution.</p>
      <p>But in its ruling on Tuesday, the court held that Ihedioha fulfilled all requirements of the election and thereby affirmed his victory. </p>
