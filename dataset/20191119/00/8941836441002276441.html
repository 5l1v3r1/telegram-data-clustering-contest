      <p>DELPHI, Ind. (AP) - A planned northern Indiana park honoring two teenage girls who were slain in 2017 is getting donated light poles to illuminate its softball fields and playgrounds.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/purdue-research-foundation/">Purdue Research Foundation</a> donated 10 outdoor light poles and lighting fixtures for the Abby and Libby Memorial Park. That park near Delphi is named for 14-year-old Liberty German and 13-year-old Abigail Williams, whose February 2017 deaths remain unsolved.</p>
      <p>A Duke Energy crew removed the 65-foot-tall (19.8-meter-tall) poles Monday from their concrete bases at Purdue University’s former Intermural Black Fields and put them on a trailer for delivery at the park, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) northwest of Indianapolis.</p>

        <p>Mike Patty is Liberty German’s grandfather. He says the poles will go on pallets so they can be painted before they’re installed at the park.</p>
