      <h1>3AW manager reinstated to 'evolve' radio under Nine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:10:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author">Broede Carmody</a></address>
      <p>Macquarie Media has reinstated 3AW station manager Stephen Beers just weeks after showing him the door.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday morning, Macquarie's recently-appointed managing director Tom Malone wrote to Melbourne-based staff informing them of Beers' return. The local station boss was let go last month as part of a restructure that also saw CEO Adam Lang and 6PR's commercial director Gordon Hill leave the business ahead of Nine's full takeover.</p>

      <p>"I have taken this decision because even in my first week I see what an important contribution Stephen has made to the success of 3AW in this city and for this community," Mr Malone wrote. "We need his wisdom and support as we move forward together.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking forward to working closely with him as we evolve the sound of 3AW and 1278 [Macquarie Sports], improve the way we produce and commercialise our content and move closer together with the TV, print and digital parts of our business to drive audience and revenue growth for each other."</p>
      <p>3AW's high-profile mornings presenter Neil Mitchell has welcomed the move, arguing it was "madness" to dump the local station boss in the first place. Afternoons host Denis Walter also chimed-in on social media to describe the appointment as "Christmas arrived early".</p>

      <p>Ex-senator and former 3AW broadcaster Derryn Hinch had voiced his concerns over Beers' axing, arguing staff would lose a champion of local content at a time when Nine was looking to streamline the business. Nine is the owner of this masthead.</p>
      <p>3AW's sister station, Brisbane's 4BC, lost its last locally-produced show earlier this year. Macquarie has also axed talk programs on Macquarie Sports Radio and announced a review of the radio station.</p>
      <p>In Melbourne, 3AW dominates the radio landscape with a massive 15.2 per cent share of the city's radio market. Macquarie Sports 1278 has by far the smallest audience share among Melbourne's 14 major radio stations (0.4 per cent).</p>
      <p>The broadcaster has been contacted for further comment.</p>
