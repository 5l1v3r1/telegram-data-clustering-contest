      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Cam Newton’s future in Carolina will depend on how well he recovers from a foot injury.</p>
      <p>Panthers owner <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">David Tepper</a> said in a meeting with reporters Monday the organization won’t decide on Newton’s long-term future until after they determine if the quarterback has fully healed from a Lisfranc injury in his left foot, one that resulted in him being placed on injured reserve earlier this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">Tepper</a> said he does not know if Newton plans to have surgery.</p>
      <p>Newton, 30, played only two games for the Panthers this season before the team decided to shut him down.</p>
      <p>The 2015 league MVP is slated to cost $21.1 million under next year’s salary cap, but the team could save $19 million if they cut him or trade him.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">Tepper</a> knows that.</p>
      <p>But he said it is impossible to evaluate Newton right now given the uncertainty of his recovery.</p>
      <p>Ideally, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">Tepper</a> said Newton makes a full recovery, remains with the Panthers and leads the organization to a Super Bowl title.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">Tepper</a> spoke to reporters Monday on the condition he was not directly quoted, but that everything he said could be attributed to him. </p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">Tepper</a>, who bought the team in 2018, said he is pleased with the development of second-year quarterback Kyle Allen, who is 5-3 as the team’s starting quarterback this season despite his recent struggles with turnovers. Allen has nine interceptions in the past four games, three of which the Panthers have lost.</p>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">Tepper</a>, the team did not attend the workout for free agent Colin Kaepernick because they aren’t interested in bringing in a veteran quarterback at this time. He likes what the team has now with Allen and rookie Will Grier, the team’s third-round draft pick.</p>
        <p>He said bringing in a quarterback right now doesn’t make any sense.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-tepper/">Tepper</a> also addressed several other topics related to the team:</p>
        <p>- He reiterated he wants to build a new football stadium within the next five to 10 years in Charlotte with help from city and county funding. The team’s existing stadium is 25 years old.</p>
        <p>- He still wants to bring an expansion Major League Soccer franchise team to the city and hopes the league would allow the team to use its current football stadium for games.</p>
        <p>- He said the plan is for the team’s new practice facility and headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina to be completed by August 2022, in time for that season’s training camp.</p>
        <p>- He said the Panthers will make a decision on whether to continue to have training camp at Wofford College by February. The other option would be hosting training camp in Charlotte, where he recently built a practice bubble.</p>
