      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday an agreement with the Trump administration on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal can be reached if it is enforceable.</p>
      <p>"We can reach an agreement on USMCA when the Trade Representative makes the new NAFTA agreement enforceable for Americaâ€™s workers," Pelosi said in a joint statement with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal after meeting with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who has been critical of the accord.</p>
      <p>The White House has dismissed House Democrats' efforts to shore up enforcement of the trade agreement's labor and environmental provisions, which are key union concerns, as purely political.</p>
