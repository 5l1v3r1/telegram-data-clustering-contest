      <p><i>(Updated: 3:51 p.m. EST, 11/19/2019)</i><b>Topline:</b> Two guards who were assigned to Jeffrey Epstein the morning he killed himself were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2019/11/19/justice-dept-charges-two-manhattan-jail-workers-accused-of-failing-to-check-on-jeffrey-epstein-before-his-death-in-august/?wpisrc=al_news__alert-national&amp;wpmk=1">federally charged</a> Tuesday morning for allegedly failing to perform mandatory checks on him and falsifying records saying the checks were done.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The charges against guards Tova Noel and Michael Thomas are the first made in a criminal inquiry into how Epstein, 66, was able to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epstein-accused-child-sex-trafficker-dies-by-suicide-in-jail/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2547286974&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesMainTwitter#7546904b5169">hang himself</a> while awaiting trial over federal sex-trafficking charges.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/nyregion/epstein-prison-guards-arrested.html"><i>New York</i> <i>Times</i></a> said the guards, both Federal Bureau of Prisons employees, are expected to appear in Manhattan’s U.S. district court Tuesday.</li>
        <li>Federal prosecutors are accusing the guards, who were assigned to check on Epstein every half hour, of failing to perform those checks and then falsifying records to cover their tracks. </li>
        <li>The 20-page <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1218466/download">indictment</a> lays out for the first time what happened inside the jail the night Epstein died; video footage showed no one entered the wing between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. the following morning.</li>
        <li>Epstein’s cell was about 15 feet away from the guards’ desk, where investigators concluded the pair were browsing the internet and sleeping, and they only discovered he was dead “with a noose around his neck” when they went to give him breakfast around 6:30 a.m.</li>
        <li>According to the indictment, the two guards said to a supervisor who arrived on the scene that the mandatory checks had not been completed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment by <i>Forbes</i>. Montell Figgins, Thomas’ lawyer, and Jason E. Foy, Noel’s lawyer, also did not immediately respond to requests for comment by <i>Forbes</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote: </b>“The defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction,” said U.S. attorney Geoffrey Berman in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/correctional-officers-charged-falsifying-records-august-9th-and-10th-metropolitan">statement</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> Epstein’s August 10 death was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/08/16/medical-examiner-rules-jeffrey-epsteins-death-a-suicide-reports/">ruled a suicide</a> by the New York City medical examiner, despite a pathologist hired by the disgraced financier’s family <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/10/30/epstein-a-suicideor-murder-new-york-city-examiner-disputes-pathologists-homicide-claim/#48c514f21fe0">claiming</a> the autopsy showed signs of homicide. But questions have lingered about how one of the country’s most high-profile prisoners was able to kill himself, especially since he was on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epstein-accused-child-sex-trafficker-dies-by-suicide-in-jail/#57f887b15169">suicide watch</a> a little over two weeks before his death.</p>
      <p>At the time of Epstein’s death, it was reported that the guards were working <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-08-11/jeffrey-epstein-guards-overtime-shifts">“extreme overtime”</a> due to staffing shortages at Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) jail. The <a href="https://apnews.com/11ae6142bbb84af49daae80b94f1b4e2">Associated Press</a> reported Friday that the two guards were offered a plea deal from federal prosecutors, but they rejected it. Accused of running a sex ring of underage girls, Epstein was charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy July 8, and was being held without bail. </p>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> <a href="https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/nym/">MCC</a> holds around 750 inmates, but only has about 110 officers on staff⁠—and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/nyregion/epstein-suicide-death.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">only 18</a> were on duty when Epstein killed himself. Complaints that the jail is chronically understaffed, and its role in Epstein’s death, have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/it-was-inevitable-officers-watching-epstein-were-on-overtime-due-to-jail-staffing-shortage-union-president-says/2019/08/11/2b611404-bc5e-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html">reported</a> by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-prisons-chief-removed-in-wake-of-epstein-suicide-11566235716">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750709305/justice-department-raises-questions-about-jail-where-epstein-died">outlets</a>.
