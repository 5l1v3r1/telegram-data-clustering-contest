      <p>The Ikeja High Court on Tuesday remanded dismissed police inspector, Ogunyemi Olalekan, at the Ikoyi Prisons after he was arraigned for allegedly killing <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/kolade-johnson/"><u><b>Kolade Johnson</b></u></a>, at a viewing centre in Lagos State.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the dismissed police officer during his arraignment pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder.</p>
      <p>Following his plea, Mr Yhaqub Oshoala, Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution, requested that Olalekan, who has been incarcerated at the Ikoyi Prison since his arrest, continue to be remanded at the facility.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We ask that the defendant continue to be detained in prison custody before the trial date. Our witnesses are available and we are ready to commence”.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The presiding judge, Justice A.J Coker, told the defence counsel, Ike Ezekwen, to explain to Olalekan the option of a bargaining agreement before the trial commences.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“This case is adjourned to January 15, 2020 for trial. The defendant is further remanded at the Ikoyi Correctional Facility.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The prosecution team is enjoined to bring their witnesses to court,”</i> Justice Coker said.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution, Olalekan, a dismissed police inspector working with Special Anti-Cultism Squad, committed the offence at 5.10 p.m. on March 31 at Onipetesi Estate, Mangoro area of Lagos.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The former police inspector unlawfully killed Johnson by shooting him with an AK47 rifle in the lower abdomen.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The offence contravenes Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015″.</i>
