      <p>The speculation surrounding the Spain international has gathered pace in recent weeks, with Madrid and Barca both said to be desperate to complete a deal for the central midfielder.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Calciomercato</i>, City are also huge admirers of the 23-year-old, who has impressed for Napoli since arriving from Real Betis in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>Ruiz scored seven times in 40 appearances for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carlo-ancelotti/"><b>Carlo Ancelotti</b></a>'s side last season while he has netted once in 11 Serie A appearances during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has a contract in Naples until the summer of 2023, placing his Italian club in a strong position when it comes to any potential negotiation.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/transfer-talk/news/real-madrid-hold-talks-with-fabian-ruiz_377607.html">it was reported</a> that there is no release clause in Ruiz's contract, and Napoli would be looking for an offer of somewhere between £69m and £86m.</p>
