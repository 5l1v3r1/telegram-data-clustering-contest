      <p>The Auditor General, Daniel Yao Domelevo, has been reportedly granted bail by the Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) in an ongoing trial over alleged procurement malpractices.</p>
      <p>The trial is in relation to alleged procurement breaches in respect of some vehicles procured by the Ghana Audit Service (GAS) in 2018.</p>
      <p>Mr. Domelevo, in a November 18 letter addressed to the acting Executive Director of EOCO, bemoaned his woes at the hands of EOCO.</p>
      <p>He narrated in the letter that for close to four weeks now, EOCO had been inviting officers of GAS including himself on the premise of investigating the alleged procurement malpractices.</p>
      <p>“I was personally invited by a letter dated November 7, 2019 which invitation I honoured out of respect for your office on November 14, 2019 only to be cautioned by your officers and asked for a caution statement which I gave,” his letter sighted by DAILY GUIDE read.</p>
      <p>“I had to be granted bail – thanks to my driver – before I was allowed to leave your premises,” it added.</p>
      <p>In the letter, the Auditor General argued forcefully that EOCO does not have the jurisdiction to investigate corruption-related offences which have been defined in Act 959 to include breaches of procurement.</p>
      <p>He further argued in the letter that “it is quite bizarre and unfathomable why your office would purport to be investigating procurement breaches when in fact it does not have any legal authority to do so unless there are any hidden or ill motives behind your actions.”</p>
