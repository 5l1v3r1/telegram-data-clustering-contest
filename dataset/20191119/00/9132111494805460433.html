      <p>The Health Minister, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu, has advised the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) to stop its incessant noise over the distribution of 307 procured ambulances for healthcare delivery in the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview on Adom FM’s morning show Dwaso Nsem on Tuesday, the Health Minister explained that, a pre-deliberate inspection of the ambulances needed to be undertaken by the suppliers of the ambulances before distribution across the country.</p>
      <p>The Minister expressed surprise at the attitude of the Minority and accused them of engaging in dirty politics.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes I try hard to understand our opponents; all they know is to do dirty politics even with health issues. I am shocked at their attitude, we need to undertake certain processes before we can take ownership of the ambulances and so we cannot rush. We are yet to do pre-deliberate inspection and that is what we are currently working on,” he clarified.</p>
      <p>“When they (NDC) received the ‘Aayalolo’ buses, didn’t they park them because they were waiting for branding? And they want us to rush, we didn’t bring the buses to use them for funfair,” he jabbed.</p>
      <p>In September 2019, President Nana Akufo-Addo announced the arrival of the first batch of the 307 ambulances to be distributed to all 275 constituencies in the country.</p>
      <p>The buses, numbering 48, have since been parked at the forecourt of the State House, as government awaits the delivery of the remaining 259 ambulances.</p>
