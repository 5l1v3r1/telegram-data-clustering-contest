        <b>In the match against Denmark on Monday, some Ireland fans sang about a controversial incident between Eriksen, his wife, and Vertonghen.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A few months ago there was a rumour that Vertonghen had had a relationship or affair with Eriksen's wife.</p>
      <p><b>This provoked controversy in Tottenham'sÂ dressing room</b> and the Ireland fans reminded him of it in the match against Denmark.</p>

      <p>At one point in the match, a section of the stand chanted at Eriksen to distract him and put him off: "<b>He's sha***ng your wife</b>, Jan Vertonghen he's sh***ng your wife".</p>
      <p>In the end, the match ended in a 1-1 draw with goals from <b>Braithwaite and Doherty</b>, the latter in the last 5 minutes of the match.</p>
