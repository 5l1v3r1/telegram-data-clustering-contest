      <p>ST. LOUIS (AP) - A 19-year-old has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for a pair of carjackings, including one that led to a St. Louis-area crash that killed a 9-year-old boy and injured three relatives as they returned from a trip to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> World in Florida.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis-post-dispatch/">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> reports that Darian Cummings was sentenced Monday for two counts of first-degree robbery. He also faces a second-degree murder charge in the death of Caleb Lee.</p>
      <p>Both carjackings happened in April 2017. In the second heist, Cummings sped away from a police officer, ran a red light near St. Louis Lambert International Airport and crashed into the car in which Caleb was riding with his mother, aunt and 5-year-old brother.</p>
      <p>Cumming was 16 at the time but was tried as an adult.</p>
