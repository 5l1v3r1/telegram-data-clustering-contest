      <h3>Atiku Loses Close Personal Aide</h3>
      <p><b>Alhaji Umar Pariya</b>, better known as “Mr. Pee” a longstanding aide to former Vice President of Nigeria, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/just-in-supreme-court-gives-reasons-why-it-rejected-atikus-appeal-against-buhari/"><u><b>Atiku Abubakar</b></u></a> is dead.</p>
      <p>He died on Tuesday, November 19 and has since been buried in accordance with Islamic rite.</p>
      <p>A statement by the Atiku Media Office which was signed by <b>Paul Ibe</b> describes the death of the former Vice President’s Personal Assistant as sad and painful.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“He (Pariya) was a committed loyalist, a strong pillar of support in (my) life’s journeys and struggles in good, rough and uncertain times.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He gave a good account of his service to the nation and association with my humble self, right from our days in the Department of Customs and Excise spanning over three decades.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>He showed love and solidarity to me and my family and in the process became a member of my family”</i>, the statement quoted Atiku as saying.</p>
      <p>The former Vice President takes solace in the reality that Allah gives life and determines when He calls whomever He created.</p>
      <p><i>“I commiserate with his wives, children and his friends; people who have benefitted from his kind-hearted nature. He was dear to many in high and low places. I will greatly miss him!”</i>, Atiku said.</p>
      <p>He prays to Almighty Allah to forgive Umar Pariya his sins and grant him Aljannah Firdaus.</p>
