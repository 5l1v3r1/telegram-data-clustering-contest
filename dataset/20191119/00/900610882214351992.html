      <p>Be it on the cultural front or from an economic and development perspective, India and Japan have bolstered their ties across several avenues. A recent update being the two superpowers gearing up for a 2+2 dialogue in Delhi on November 30, 2019 to discuss their defence cooperation.</p>
      <p>Even in terms of tourism, various initiatives are being undertaken to increase tourist arrivals between both the regions. This is evident from the fact that Japan saw a 14.3 per cent increase in Indian travellers from July 2018 to July 2019.</p>
      <p>Japan being the third largest source of Foreign Direct Investment into India and India becoming the largest recipient of Japanese official development assistance (ODA) are few instances that highlight India and Japan’s firm link.</p>

      <p>She received the award from the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in the presence of His Majesty, The Emperor at The Imperial Palace on November 7, 2019.</p>
      <p>Chairperson of FICCI Tourism Committee, Dr Suri’s initiatives include participating in activities of the India-Japan Parliamentarians Forum; her involvement in the first India-Japan Tourism Meet in 2016 and strengthening the people-to-people connect between the two regions.</p>
