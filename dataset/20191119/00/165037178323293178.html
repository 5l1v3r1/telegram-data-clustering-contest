        <b>After three wins from eight matches in charge of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, Diego Maradona has stepped down</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Diego Maradona has stepped down as head coach</b> of Superliga Argentina club Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata after a little over two months in charge.</p>
      <p>The former Argentina and Napoli great oversaw eight matches at Gimnasia, which yielded three wins and five defeats. <b>Relegation-threatened Gimnasia remain third bottom of the table</b> and the news that club president Gabriel Pellegrino will not stand for re-election this weekend has persuaded Maradona to walk away.</p>
      <p>"Maradona stopped working today, he's no longer Gimnasia's head coach," Pellegrino told Radio La Red. "<b>Maradona worked in a collective scheme</b>. He said he was here to add, not to rest. He'd love to continue, but he wants unity. <b>It just didn't happen</b>."</p>
      <p>Mariano Cowen and Salvador Robustelli will contest the presidency, but Maradona did not wish to continue in Pellegrino's absence. "Today's meeting failed. <b>There will be elections on Saturday</b>. [Diego Maradona] gave his will and he gave his time. He had an enormous will. There will be elections on Saturday and <b>[the candidates] will look for a head coach.</b>"</p>

      <p><b>Pellegrino was influential in persuading Maradona</b> to resume a fitful and nomadic coaching career. Gimnasia were the first team the 59-year-old had led in his homeland since the mid-1990s, when <b>he enjoyed brief spells in charge of Textil Mandiyu and Racing Club </b>while serving a playing ban for a failed drugs test during the 1994 World Cup.</p>
      <p>He spectacularly returned more than a decade later to lead Argentina at the 2010 World Cup,<b> where they were beaten by Germany in the quarter-finals</b>. Stints with Al-Wasl and Fujairah in the UAE came before a 2018-19 tenure at Mexican second-tier club Dorados de Sinaloa, which <b>became the subject of a Netflix documentary series</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Mariano Messera</b>, the club's former midfielder, <b>will take charge of Gimnasia's home match against Arsenal </b>de Sarandi this weekend.</p>
