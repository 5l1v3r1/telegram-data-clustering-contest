      <h3>Michy Batshuayi has insisted that he plans to stay loyal to Chelsea FC despite his lack of playing time at the west London club.</h3>
      <p>The 26-year-old Belgian striker is yet to start a single Premier League game this season under Frank Lampard despite making seven appearances from the bench for the Blues.</p>
      <p>His only starts for Chelsea FC so far this season have come in the League Cup, where he scored three goals in two games for Lampard’s side.</p>
      <p>Batshuayi has made 11 appearances in all competitions so far for Chelsea FC this season but he has found himself behind the likes of Tammy Abraham in the pecking order under Lampard this term.</p>
      <p>His lack of playing time may eventually lead to speculation about his long-term future at the west London club.</p>
      <p>However, the striker has now insisted that he remains fully committed to Chelsea FC and has no intention of leaving any time soon.</p>
      <p>Batshuayi is quoted as saying by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/michy-batshuayi-speaks-chelsea-future-lack-starts-frank-lampard-11172960/">Metro</a>: “I have never been a full-fledged starter, but Chelsea is my club, that’s where I feel at home. It’s a club I love deeply.”</p>
      <p>The striker will be hoping to feature when the west London club return to Premier League action after the international break with a trip to Manchester City on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Blues have won their last six games in the Premier League to leave them third in the table.</p>
