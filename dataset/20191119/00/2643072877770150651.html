      <p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b> wants Juventus to complete a deal for Manchester United midfielder<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/08/16/transfer-paul-pogba-could-still-leave-manchester-united-mathias-pogba/"><u><b> Paul Pogba.</b></u></a></p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands that<b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2017/12/07/ballon-dor-2017-ronaldo-hopes-to-match-messis-record-win/"><u> Ex-United </u></a>star gave</b> Juventus the green light to try and re-sign Manchester United star, Paul Pogba.</p>
      <p>The Italian champions are expected to make contact with United in the next two to three weeks over a possible move for the 26-year-old World Cup-winning midfielder, who helped them to four-consecutive Serie A titles before returning to Old Trafford in August 2016 for £89million.</p>
      <p>It would be recalled that the Manchester United star,<b> Paul Pogba</b> has been out of action since he picked up an ankle injury against Arsenal.</p>
      <p>However, it will be difficult to resist a lucrative offer from Juventus, who could offer Danilo, Emre Can, <b>Sami Khedira</b>,<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/07/24/transfer-manchester-united-set-to-sign-dybala-from-juventus/"><u><b> Paulo Dybala</b></u></a> or <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/14/transfer-mandzukic-set-to-join-manchester-united/"><u><b>Mario Mandzukic</b></u></a> to sweeten the deal.</p>
