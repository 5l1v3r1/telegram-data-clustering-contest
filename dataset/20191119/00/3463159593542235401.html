      <p>Philippines’ most decorated international player Phil Younghusband announced his retirement from international football on Monday.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old attacker is the <i>Azkals</i> most-capped player (108 appearances) and highest-ever goalscorer (52).</p>
      <p>The London-born Younghusband, whose older brother James has also enjoyed a significant international career, debuted in 2006 and was a key figure throughout the past decade as the Philippines national team enjoyed significant progress.</p>
      <p>Younghusband’s 50th international goal – he is the only Filipino to pass the landmark – was the goal that ensured historic qualification for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVAvdxNTzVY">2019 AFC Asian Cup</a> and their debut continental tournament.</p>
      <p>Philippines are currently <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/qatar2022/preliminaries/#asia">third in Group A</a> of AFC FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ qualifying, five points behind leaders Syria, and trailing China PR on goal difference.</p>
      <p>They picked up a 2-1 win away to Maldives last Thursday and face Syria later today in neutral Dubai.</p>
