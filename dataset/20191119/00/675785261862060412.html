      <h3>1. Phone your council's local homelessness team</h3>
      <p>Your local council should have a homelessness department which is responsible for looking after rough sleepers in the area.</p>
      <p>To find out which council area you live in click <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">here</a> , enter your postcode and then follow the link to your local authority's website.</p>
      <p>Councils run emergency shelters and can also organise longer-term accommodation for the homeless.</p>
      <p>Each council website will contain details on how to contact them.</p>
      <h3>2. Direct help to rough sleepers through StreetLink</h3>
      <p>You can also report a rough sleeper's location through the StreetLink application, enabling the council to track them down.</p>
      <p>To learn more about the initiative go on the StreetLink website <a href="https://www.streetlink.org.uk/StreetLink_HomePage">here</a> .</p>
      <p>StreetLink will ask you for the rough sleeper's location, when you saw them and for any information you have about the individual.</p>
      <h3>3: Say hello</h3>
      <p>Homeless people are often isolated and feel invisible because people walk past them, <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/how-you-can-help-you-17276275">Glasgow Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>A friendly word and showing you care can make a big difference. You could even grab them a tea, coffee or a sandwich or give them some change, if you have some to spare.</p>
      <p>If you've got time, you could even provide them with useful items. Foil blankets, socks, hats and other winter warmers can be bought in pound shops and charity shops.</p>
      <p>If you spot a woman on the street, a care bag with menstrual products and baby wipes can go a long way.</p>
