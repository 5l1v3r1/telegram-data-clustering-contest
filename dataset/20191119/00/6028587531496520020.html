      <p>As its global reach increases, Brazilian cosmetics giant Natura&amp;Co wants to use technological innovation to generate profit while meeting its social responsibility goals.</p>
      <p>Natura is a São Paulo-headquartered conglomerate that includes British company The Body Shop, Australian firm Aesop and will soon include Avon Products - the acquisition of the latter received shareholder clearance last week.</p>
      <p>According to Guilherme Leal, co-founder of the group, the challenges around integrating and substantially expanding the company's army of independent salespeople with the new acquired company is a “huge opportunity,” which will be leveraged with digital tools.</p>
      <p>After absorbing Avon, Natura will have six million sales representatives worldwide. However, Leal considers that the digitized relationship between consultants and clients includes aspects of transformation that go beyond purely increasing revenue.</p>
      <p>In recent years, Natura has invested in several initiatives geared at digitally enabling its network of more than 1 million representatives in Brazil, with features such as the creation of online stores and the provision of payment services, as well as data insights to support sales.</p>
      <p>“We understand that [technology] brings the opportunity to make a real difference and effectively changing culture,” he said at an event in São Paulo last month. “When you link technology and innovation [to the business] and turn [representatives] into real micro influencers, you have a chance to spread citizenship, transparency and ethical commitment and go beyond the business aspect.”</p>
      <p>On the topic of the gig economy, which bears some resemblance to the method employed by both Natura and Avon for decades, Leal says he faces no criticisms due the tradition of independence associated with the direct selling model, but accepts that the rules that support the new working models will also need to be transformed.</p>
      <p>“Direct selling has always been a flexible working alternative in which people, predominantly women, could reconcile a range of activities with part-time work to supplement their income,” he says.</p>
      <p>“Today's alternative [working patterns], which are far from being a replacement for good employment with a more stable working relationship, address people's needs somehow,” he points out, referring to activities such as a working as a driver through apps.</p>
      <p>“We will have the huge challenge of redesigning the social contract, as technologies will generate mass unemployment. Common sense needs to prevail in this redesign.”</p>
      <p>Similarly to issues related to climate change and mass migrations, the disappearance of jobs is something that will have to be dealt with sooner rather than later, according to the executive, who points to the need for a culture shift in order to face these new realities.</p>
      <p>“We are going through an era of change with accelerated technological development, but if we are to continue to focus on our particular interests, we will not win,” he warns. “But if we change our ways of thinking, there might be some wonderful opportunities ahead of us.”</p>
