      <p><b>Topline: </b>With 2019 turning out to be a big year for initial public offerings, one of next year’s most hotly anticipated IPOs, Airbnb, already has substantial funding and is likely to debut on the public markets through a direct listing, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/airbnb-ceo-on-ipo-process-odds-in-2020-we-dont-need-the-money.html">first reported</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once expected to go public this year, Airbnb is in no rush to open its shares, as the company has already built a war chest to run its business, founder and CEO Brian Chesky <a href="http://cnbc.com/2019/11/18/airbnb-ceo-on-ipo-process-odds-in-2020-we-dont-need-the-money.html">told</a> CNBC on Monday.</li>
        <li>“We don’t need to raise money, and so we haven’t been in a rush,” Chesky said in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/airbnb-ceo-on-ipo-process-odds-in-2020-we-dont-need-the-money.html">interview</a>, which some see as an indication that the company is indeed leaning toward a direct listing.</li>
        <li>Airbnb said last month that it <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/09/19/airbnb-plans-to-go-public-in-2020/#11481913c12a">plans to go public</a> in 2020, though the company hasn’t confirmed whether it would, like Spotify and Slack, opt for a direct listing.</li>
        <li>In a nontraditional direct public offering, current shareholders are able to trade their shares but new shares aren’t issued, eliminating the need for middlemen such as investment banks or underwriters.</li>
        <li>Airbnb was launched in 2008 and has raised a total of $4.4 billion across 15 venture capital funding rounds, according to Crunchbase, giving it a valuation of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/19/18272274/airbnb-valuation-common-stock-hoteltonight?mod=article_inline">$35 billion</a>, which would make it the fourth-largest U.S. unicorn (a private company worth at least $1 billion).</li>
        <li>In a big marketing play, Airbnb also just recently signed a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sofialottopersio/2019/11/18/airbnb-olympic-partnership-ahead-ipo/#6e51ed5257a1">massive Olympics sponsorship deal</a>, rumored to be worth $500 million, according to the <i>Financial Times</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote: </b>“Our large shareholders, most of our large investors, have told us they intended to hold the stock for a long time and they actually were doing the opposite of pressuring us to go public,” Chesky said in the CNBC <a href="http://cnbc.com/2019/11/18/airbnb-ceo-on-ipo-process-odds-in-2020-we-dont-need-the-money.html">interview</a>. “We think next year will be the right time for us.”</p>
      <p><b>Tangent: </b>Two big banks, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, are poised to become the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/03/morgan-stanley-goldman-sachs-are-poised-to-lead-airbnbs-direct-listing-sources.html">lead advisors</a> on Airbnb’s probable direct listing, according to CNBC. Both banks were also involved in the direct listings for music-streaming platform Spotify in 2018 and workplace-messaging app Slack in 2019. Since their listings, Spotify’s shares are down 8% and Slack’s almost 44%.</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Big-name tech startups haven’t exactly fared well in the IPO market this year. Uber and Lyft’s shares, for instance, are down 35% and 44%, respectively, since going public. Another overhyped unicorn, WeWork, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/09/30/weworks-new-leadership-officially-cancels-ipo-plans/">canceled its IPO plans</a> after significant concerns from investors about the company’s business model and corporate governance. Airbnb CEO Chesky recently said that WeWork’s failure <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-what-caused-weworks-fall.html">taught him two lessons</a>—the importance of profit margins and reputation. It remains to be seen whether Airbnb, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/ahead-of-ipo-airbnb-achieves-profitability-for-second-year-in-a-row/">said</a> it was profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2018, can attract interest in the market.</p>
