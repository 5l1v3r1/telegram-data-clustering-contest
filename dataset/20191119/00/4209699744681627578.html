      <p>The Christian Association of Nigeria has called on parents across the country to warn their children against dressing indecently so as not to invite rapists.</p>
      <p>Chairman of CAN (North Central Zone), Rev Israel Akanji, gave the warning in Abuja on Tuesday during a summit organised by the Women’s Wing of Christian Council of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>According to him, churches must come up with tough measures against indecent dressing, adding that it was against the teachings of the Bible.</p>
      <p>Akanji said, “When people wear mini dresses, sometimes they even wear it to church we must speak against it.</p>
      <p>“Some of us try not to talk about it because we feel if we talk to them, they may not return to our churches.</p>
      <p>“The church has to come up with tough measures against indecent dressing; indecent dressing must not be accepted in the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>“I want to appeal to parents that while we are waiting for a law that will deal with rapists (I know that laws exist right now), they must warn their children.</p>
      <p>“Some children dress in such a way that they appear as if they are inviting rapists to their lives.</p>
      <p>“They are almost naked, they expose body parts that some people cannot control themselves.</p>
      <p>“Let us return to the culture of decent dressing, it may not stop but it will minimise it.”<br/><br/><br/> </p>
