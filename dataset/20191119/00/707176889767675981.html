      <h1>EY chair says higher audit fees will spur competition</h1>
      <h2>Steve Varley claims smaller firms should be encouraged by rising charges</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:04:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:04</time> by <a rel="author">Tabby Kinder</a></address>
      <p>A significant increase in UK audit fees should encourage smaller firms to challenge the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8f28a750-02e5-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3">dominance of the Big Four</a>, the UK chairman of EY has claimed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/3866cb54-cf90-46e6-b6bc-cd1d762bdad7">Steve Varley</a>, who has been chairman of EY UK since 2011, made the prediction as the Big Four auditor said that charging companies more for vetting their books had helped lift annual profits.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, <a href="https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/EY">EY</a> warned its largest listed British clients, which include Vodafone, Burberry and Aston Martin Lagonda, that they would have to pay more for audits because of “unprecedented market forces”. The UK accounting industry faces the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/73a7bb34-c338-11e8-8d55-54197280d3f7">largest overhaul in decades </a>amid intense scrutiny from politicians and regulators.</p>
      <p>A double-digit percentage increase in audit fees contributed to a 2 per cent growth in EY UK’s audit revenues to £453m in the 12 months to June 30. Profits from the audit business rose by £10m to £68m in 2019.</p>
      <p>“The reaction from clients has been positive overall, as boards know it will deliver higher quality audits,” Mr Varley said of the jump in fees. “None of them want to get an invitation to appear before a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/79b07254-f574-11e9-b018-3ef8794b17c6">select committee inquiry</a>.”</p>
      <blockquote>We believe comprehensive changes are needed to address corporate reporting, the scope of the audit, a strengthened regulator, and the accountability and regulation of both auditors and company directors<cite>Steve Varley</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The rise in audit fees being charged by EY has been mirrored by Deloitte, PwC and KPMG, who together make up the Big Four accountants. Last year Grant Thornton, a mid-tier firm, dropped out of competing for the audits of FTSE 350 companies, citing the high cost of pitching, comparatively low fees and the likelihood it would lose out to a Big Four firm.</p>
      <p>Mr Varley said EY was conducting “various scenario planning”, including for a forced split of its audit and advisory functions, which is being considered by the British government. </p>
      <p>“We believe the right set of comprehensive changes are needed to address corporate reporting, the scope of the audit, a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e93b72fa-da03-11e8-9f04-38d397e6661c">strengthened regulator</a>, and the accountability and regulation of both auditors and company directors,” Mr Varley said. </p>
      <p>A series of accounting scandals, including the collapse of outsourcer Carillion in early 2018, has led to a string of investigations into the audit market, including by the competition watchdog,<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/22a61964-699d-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec"> Legal &amp; General chairman John Kingman </a>and former London Stock Exchange boss Donald Brydon. </p>
      <p>The higher audit fees EY UK commanded helped the firm offset soaring compliance costs and the need for greater investment in audit quality and technology last year. Overall revenues grew 1.5 per cent to £2.45bn, while distributable profits — the amount shared between its equity partners — increased to £477m from £472m. </p>

      <p>However, the average pay of its partners dropped from £693,000 to £679,000 after the number of partners rose from 681 to 702. Among its Big Four rivals, Deloitte partners made an average of £882,000 in 2019 and PwC partners made £765,000. KPMG is expected to report an average payout of £550,000 when it publishes its results next month.</p>
      <p>Revenues in EY’s advisory business and assurance unit fell by 3 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Its deals advisory practice grew 9 per cent, while tax revenues increased 8 per cent.</p>
      <p>Globally, EY reported annual revenues of $36.4bn in the 12 months to June 30, an increase of 8 per cent. Carmine Di Sibio, global chief executive, has hit back at calls for the UK firms to be broken up. He has maintained that the quality of EY’s audits depended on it remaining a multidisciplinary firm.</p>
      <p>EY UK was last censured by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2017 over misconduct in its 2012 audit of Tech Data, an American IT company. The FRC said this year that 89 per cent of EY’s audits of FTSE 350 companies required “no more than limited improvements”, its highest mark, an improvement on 82 per cent in 2018.</p>
