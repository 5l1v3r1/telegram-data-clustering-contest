      <h1>Adobe's push to detect false images, digital beautification</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:53:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:53</time> by <a rel="author">Cynthia Karena</a></address>
      <p>Adobe, maker of Photoshop, is hoping to create the ultimate weapon against faked images: tools that let you know whether a photo has been altered, and in some cases let you "undo" the alterations to reproduce the original image.</p>
      <p>From slimmer and wrinkle free magazine models to shiny sparkly-eyed Instagram celebrities, and from younger headshots for resumes to half-naked world leaders riding horses, we’re constantly bombarded by fakes.</p>

        <figcaption>After providing the tools most commonly used to manipulate photos, Adobe is now making a tool that detects fakes.</figcaption>

      <p>Technology has made it easy to tamper with images and videos and pass off the results as real, and Adobe's software has played no small part in that. At this year’s Adobe Max creativity conference in Los Angeles, chief product officer Scott Belsky said the company feels some responsibility to be part of the solution and announced a strategy to help reduce the effect of fake content.</p>
      <p>Adobe is partnering with Twitter and <i>The New York Times</i> on a program called the <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/content-authenticity-initiative/?red=a">Content Authenticity Initiative</a>, and the three companies want it to become an industry-wide standard to create some trust and transparency around online posts, Belsky said.</p>
      <p>Firstly they want to see attribution, so everyone knows who created the content. Secondly, a summarised edit trail for people to see what changes were made.</p>
      <p>This is all just in the planning and development phase, but one of the most exciting developments Adobe brings to the table is called 'About Face'; software built in collaboration with University of California Berkeley scientists and funded by the US Department of Defense that detects when a photo of a face has been altered.</p>

      <p>Did someone really make Trump’s face look like that, or is it the real thing? Does that magazine model really have such big eyes and high cheekbones?</p>
      <p>At Adobe's conference research scientist Richard Zhang demonstrated an early version of About Face by stretching and manipulating a photo.</p>

      <p>The software then analyses the photo and displays the likelihood of manipulation as a probability score, in this demo it was 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>"As I'm stretching out his forehead, that means certain pixels are being stretched," said Zhang. "It’s only looking directly at the pixels."</p>
      <p>For example, About Face can identify whether a forehead has been made smaller or a jawline tightened, because it can work out which pixels have been stretched or condensed.</p>
      <p>The AI within the program was trained to recognise manipulated images by looking at thousands of altered images of faces generated from the original, using both Photoshop and a human artist.</p>
      <p>"Now wouldn’t it be cool if it could also tell us which pixels were actually touched?" said Zhang.</p>
      <p>"Once we’ve found that an image has been edited, we can also predict what parts of the image were manipulated."</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.004%2C$multiply_1.5109%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_39%2C$y_154/t_crop_custom/q_62%2Cf_auto/cc637b0561102246b2f3a816e5c1dfa6c6b978d2"/>
        <figcaption>The About Face tool makes suggestions for getting the altered photo back its original state, though it's not perfect.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In the demo, the equivalent of a highlighter mark was drawn over the changes in what is called a heatmap, which shows us where edits have been made, and to what extent.</p>
      <p>"We see an overlay on the image showing how much we think that region has been warped," said Zhang.</p>
      <p>And the fascinating thing is that, if About Face knows where the manipulations are, it can reverse them.</p>
      <p>The 'undo' option recovers what About Face thinks the original image looks like.</p>
      <p>Perhaps not so great for celebrities and artists who use photo manipulation tools to make art or present a 'better' face to the world. But great for the rest of us, particularly young people, to easily see how faces are changed in magazines and on social media, or to 'undo' the glitz and see the original with all its skin imperfections, eye bags, puffy faces, and wrinkled glory.</p>
