      <p>A court has given Jonah Jang, former governor of Plateau State, 14 days to prepare his no-case submission application and file for a hearing.</p>
      <p>The State High Court in Jos gave the order on Monday after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission closed its case. </p>
      <p>The former governor, through his lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), is arguing that EFCC has not been able to link any of the allegations to him.</p>
      <p>Jang and a former cashier in the office of the Secretary to the State Government, Yusuf Pam, are being tried on 17 amended charges by the commission.</p>
      <p>The offences border on alleged corruption and money laundering amounting to over N6.3bn during his tenure as governor.</p>
      <p>Both Jang and Pam pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
      <p>Ozekhome said that no case had been established against Jang to warrant his indictment by the court.</p>
      <p>He told the court that they needed 14 days to write the formal no-case submission because of the volume of exhibits and documents tendered at the proceedings, which they have to go through.</p>
