      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A defendant charged in the 2016 killing of a 10-year-old Albuquerque girl has been released from jail pending his trial.</p>
      <p>Fabian Gonzales has been in jail for more than three years and faces a charge of child abuse resulting in death.</p>
      <p>Gonzales initially was accused of raping and murdering Victoria Martens. But prosecutors later determined he wasn’t at the girl’s apartment when she was killed.</p>
      <p>Gonzales’ cousin, Jessica Kelley, and Victoria’s mother, Michelle Martens, have taken plea agreements in the girl’s death.</p>
      <p>A judge earlier this month ruled Gonzales should be released from jail because his two misdemeanor convictions from years ago and DWI don’t qualify for pretrial detention.</p>

      <p>Albuquerque TV station KRQE reports prosecutors filed an appeal Tuesday in an effort to get Gonzales back behind bars.</p>
