      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ciro-immobile/"><b>Ciro Immobile</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolo-zaniolo/"><b>Nicolo Zaniolo</b></a> both scored twice as the Azzurri racked up an 11th straight win despite a much-changed starting line-up under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-mancini/"><b>Roberto Mancini</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Immobile and Zaniolo were among those promoted to the side after Friday's 3-0 win in Bosnia and they delivered in style against their lowly opponents.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/edgar-babayan/"><b>Edgar Babayan</b></a> had missed a good chance for Armenia in the opening minutes before Immobile nodded the Italians in front from a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/federico-chiesa/"><b>Federico Chiesa</b></a> free-kick.</p>
      <p>Almost immediately after the re-start, the home side doubled their lead when Immobile played in Zaniolo, who beat Armenian keeper Aram Hayrapetyan to net his first senior international goal.</p>
      <p>Chiesa and Immobile both came close for the Italians but Armenia should have reduced the deficit through Aleksandre Karapetyan, who pounced on a poor back-pass but hit the bar.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolo-barella/"><b>Nicolo Barella</b></a> got on the end of a threaded through-ball from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leonardo-bonucci/"><b>Leonardo Bonucci</b></a> to make it 3-0 before Immobile sprung the offside trap to strike Italy's fourth with 33 minutes gone.</p>
      <p>Immobile might have wrapped up the first period with a hat-trick when his shot clipped the post in first-half injury time, while Chiesa also hit the woodwork after the break.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo grabbed his second just past the hour mark and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alessio-romagnoli/"><b>Alessio Romagnoli</b></a> deflected home Italy's sixth goal of the night with 72 minutes on the clock.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jorginho/"><b>Jorginho</b></a> added the seventh from the spot after a trip in the box, then Bologna's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/riccardo-orsolini/"><b>Riccardo Orsolini</b></a> marked his senior debut with a goal when he headed home in the 75th minute.</p>
      <p>Babayan fired a brilliant consolation for Armenia from outside the box in the 79th minute but Chiesa finally secured his first senior goal two minutes later when he headed home from close range.</p>
