      <h1>Amazon Music gets free streaming for US, UK and Germany</h1>

      <p>Amazon has announced free streaming for users who don’t have a subscription any of Amazon’s Music services. Kinda like Spotify or YouTube Music, users will be able to play music through Amazon’s servers. The only price? Ads.</p>
      <p>“Amazon Music customers who do not yet have a Prime membership, or a subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited, can now listen to an ad-supported selection of top playlists and thousands of stations for free on their favourite devices,” <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/entertainment/free-streaming-now-available-on-amazon-music?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon explained in a blog post</a>. “Previously only available to customers on Echo devices, today’s news expands access to customers using the Amazon Music app on iOS, Android, and FireTV.“</p>
      <p>Of course, if you’re subscribed to Prime, you’ll have all these music services on demand with no ads — as well as access to other Amazon services like Prime Video and so on. If you want all of Amazon’s free catalogue, you’ll need Amazon Music Unlimited.</p>
      <p>Amazon sure has a lot of music services. One thing’s for certain, they’re hoping there’s one for everyone.</p>
