      <p>National Communications Officer of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Sammy Gyamfi has justified the party’s decision to campaign against the amendment of Article 55 of the 1992 Constitution.<br/><br/>The Minority in Parliament had earlier supported the amendment but suddenly changed its position, arguing that allowing the election of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) on partisan lines would further polarise the country.<br/><br/>The NDC has, therefore, called on Ghanaians to vote ‘No’ in the December 17 referendum.<br/><br/>The ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) at a news conference described the shocking position taken by the opposition as a stab in the back.<br/><br/>They are certain the decision by the NDC is borne out of its insatiable quest for power ahead of the 2020 general election.<br/><br/>But, reacting to the NPP on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen programme Monday, Mr Gyamfi said; “only a fool doesn’t change his mind.”<br/><br/>He explained that, even if the NDC in the past advocated for a ‘Yes’ vote, it has realised it is an affront to democracy.<br/><br/>The NDC Communication Officer is still at sea as to why the government is still rallying support for a ‘YES’ vote in the upcoming national referendum.<br/><br/>He claimed the government in its bid to ensure ‘Yes’ wins, has unleashed ‘false prophets’ across the country to confuse Ghanaians.<br/><br/>Mr Gyamfi said the NDC should be applauded for taking such nationalistic stance against the government.<br/><br/>“Will NPP legalise weed because people smoke? Their campaign for a ‘Yes’ vote defies logic. Everyone should vote ‘No’ for one united Ghana,” he rallied.<br/><br/>In a rebuttal, Director of Communications of the NPP, Yaw Boaben Asamoa said the NDC’s conduct is deliberate.<br/><br/>According to him, it will be hypocritical for anyone to suggest that political parties are not already involved in the local level elections.<br/><br/>“Everyone knows assembly members are sponsored by political parties so let’s stop, the NDC must stop this hypocrisy.” he fumed.<br/><br/>Mr Asamoa was convinced voting ‘Yes’ in the December 17 referendum would be victory for democracy.<br/><br/>Ghanaians on December 17, will be casting a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ vote in a referendum to allow MMDCEs participate in local elections based on party affiliations.<br/>The government needs at least 40 per cent of eligible voters turning out to vote and at least 75 per cent voting in favour for its ‘Yes’ campaign to succeed.
