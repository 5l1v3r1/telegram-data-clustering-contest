      <p>Winner of Atinka TV’s plus size women reality show ‘Di Asa’ has been kicked out of Emirates Airlines’ plane to Dubai because of her size, Ghanacelebrities.com reports.</p>
      <p>Precious Mensah popularly known PM, alongside two runner-ups, Maafia and Gaza, had a package of making a sponsored trip to Dubai as part of the prize for emerging as winners of the 2019 contest but “was disallowed to be onboard all because her body size was bigger than a single seat in Emirates Airlines’ flight.”</p>
      <p>The grand finale of Di Asa Season 3 came off on Saturday, September 28, 2019 at the Fantasy Dome where PM won the hearts of many after a grueling four rounds of different genre of dances.</p>
      <p>Following her superb display, PM walked home with a brand new saloon car, while the first runner-up received ‘Abossey Okai Macho’, with the third claiming ‘Aboboyaa’.</p>
      <p>They also received several other prizes from the proud sponsors of the show.</p>
