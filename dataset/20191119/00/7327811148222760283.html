      <p>BRIDGEPORT, Connecticut -- A New York City man convicted in an extortion scheme that involved kidnapping immigrants at a bus station has been sentenced in Connecticut to eight years in prison.</p>
      <p>A federal judge in Bridgeport handed down the punishment Monday to 56-year-old Carlos Hernandez, who was one of four people convicted in the case.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the defendants targeted immigrants after they got off buses in New York City, coerced them into vehicles and refused to let them go until relatives paid a ransom, usually around $1,000.</p>
      <p>The victims included men, women and children from Central American countries who did not speak English and were seeking asylum in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Some of them were headed to Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Two other defendants have been sentenced to prison and another awaits sentencing.</p>
