        <b>Latvian Trade Union of Health and Social Care Workers (LVSADA) has plans to organize a new protest act outside the Saeima on 28 November. The protest will demand the parliament’s dismissal, as well as voice distrust towards Healthcare Minister Ilze Viņķele.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Protesters will also ask the president to return to the parliament the budget draft for 2020 for a repeated review.</p>
      <p>As journalists were told by LVSADA chairman Valdis Keris, on top of the protest it is planned to submit to the Central Election Commission (CVK) a request from LVSADA to start collection of signatures for a referendum to dismiss the Saeima.</p>
      <p>At the same time, protesters will request dismissal of Latvia’s Healthcare Minister Ilze Viņķele.</p>
      <p>Representatives of the trade union plan to ask the State President Egils Levits to return the Law on State Budget 2020 and Law on Medium-Term Budget Content for 2020, 2021 and 2022 to the parliament for repeated review.</p>
      <p>The protest act itself will be discussed in more detail soon, said Keris.</p>
      <h3>Other healthcare workers’ trade unions will consider the idea in the next couple of days. Latvian Doctors Association (LAB) president Ilze Aizsilniece and Latvian Young Doctors Association (LJAA) board chairman Kārlis Rācenis stress there is a need for another protest.</h3>
      <p>On 14 November, Latvia’s Saeima approved in the final reading the country’s 2020 budget, promising to allocate approximately EUR 60 million to raise wages for doctors.</p>
      <p>Saeima’s decision made in 2018 provided for allocating EUR 120 million to raise doctors’ wages in 2020. This would have allowed raising wages by an average of 20%. However, the coalition has since admitted that approval of this law was a mistake, because there is no way to secure promised finances.</p>

          <b>Doctors: Healthcare Ministry’s offered wage increase model is unfair</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Initially it was planned to allocate EUR 42 million for doctors’ wages. However, in response to the growing outrage, a decision was made to review previously supported priorities. After reviewing budget priorities, as well as looking at profits of state companies and the central bank, the government found another EUR 18 million. This allows for allocating a total amount of EUR 60 million for doctors’ wages.</p>
      <p>LVSADA chairman Keris had previously said that if the changes requested by doctors are not implemented, a request will be put in for the healthcare minister’s dismissal, signatures will be collected for the Saeima’s dismissal and a protest organized.</p>
      <p>LAB president Aizsilniece had previously said that if doctors’ proposals end up ignored, there will be a new strike. According to her, doctors were ignored during the budget review process, and different methods were employed to ensure the budget is reviewed is as quickly as possible without addressing problems.</p>
      <p>The previous protest did not bring desired results, and although around 4 000 people had participated in it no guarantees were secured in regards to wage requests.</p>
