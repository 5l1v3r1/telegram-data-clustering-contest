      <p>Frazee was <a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/trending-now/fiance-of-missing-colorado-mother-kelsey-berreth-arrested-on-suspicion-of-murder/892546290">arrested</a> Dec. 20; Berreth was last seen on surveillance cameras at a <a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/trending-now/fiance-of-missing-colorado-mother-kelsey-berreth-arrested-on-suspicion-of-murder/892546290">grocery store</a> on Thanksgiving Day 2018.</p>
      <p>Idaho nurse Krystal Lee Kenney, who said she was Frazee's girlfriend, testified Frazee killed Berreth in her Woodland Park condo, <a href="https://www.kktv.com/content/news/Verdict-reached-in-Patrick-Frazee-trial-the-man-accused-of-killing-Woodland-Park-mom-Kelsey-Berreth-565111252.html">KKTV</a> reported. According to Lee, Frazee blindfolded Berreth while she was sniffing candles and fatally struck her on the back of the head with a baseball bat, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>Frazee then asked Kenney to come from her home in Idaho to clean the crime scene and destroy evidence, the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/18/kelsey-berreth-murder-patrick-frazee-trial-verdict/">Post</a> reported. Kenney testified she watched Frazee burn a plastic storage container with Berreth's body inside on his ranch, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Fourth Judicial District Judge Scott Sells told Frazee, "Your actions were vicious, senseless, without reason or explanation," <a href="https://gazette.com/news/patrick-frazee-trial-jury-begins-deliberations-in-the-murder-case/article_caa6065a-0a1a-11ea-afe1-8368f8e9d1c7.html">The Gazette </a>of Colorado Springs reported.</p>
      <p>Berreth was first reported missing Dec. 2, 2018, by her mother, according to the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/18/kelsey-berreth-murder-patrick-frazee-trial-verdict/">Post</a>.</p>
