        <b>Avoiding carbohydrates and substituting them with proteins has become a leading dogma for all those who care for their looks and health, while high-protein diets are very often recommended to people who suffer from diabetes or who are obese. But while cutting carbs may save us calories, high-protein diets risk the health of our kidneys, according to new studies, with people who suffer from diabetes or who are obese particularly vulnerable.</b>

      <p>People who are unaware they have mild chronic kidney disease and who are following a high-protein diet risk ‘taking the fast lane to irreversible kidney failure’.</p>
      <p>Three new studies published in the journal <i>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation,</i>​ link high-protein diets with kidney damage.  </p>
      <p>Many previous studies have shown that a high-protein diet may harm kidney function. Indeed, many people with a known early-stage chronic kidney disease are recommended a low-protein diet by medical professionals.</p>
      <p>But researchers from the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association point out that many people who are unaware they have a mild chronic kidney disease could be following the trend of eating a protein-rich diet because they believe it is healthy.<i> "These people do not know that they are taking the fast lane to irreversible kidney failure," </i>​said the ERA-EDTA’s Professor Denis Fouque. <i>"It is essential that people know there is another side to high-protein diets, and that incipient kidney disease should always be excluded before one changes one eating habits and adopts a high-protein diet."</i>​</p>

        <h3>To recommend a high-protein diet to an overweight diabetes patient may cause loss of weight, but also a severe loss of kidney function​</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, the promise of saving calories and losing weight is why high-protein diets are very often recommended to people who suffer from diabetes or who are obese. But 30% of patients with diabetes suffer from an underlying chronic kidney disease, claimed the scientists, while the number of people affected by type-2 diabetes is rising.</p>
        <p>The crux of the matter is that these groups of people are especially vulnerable to the kidney-harming effects of a high protein intake, the researchers noted.</p>
        <p><i>"A high-protein diet induces glomerular hyperfiltration, which, according to our current state of knowledge, may boost a pre-existing low-grade chronic kidney disease, which, by the way, is often prevalent in people with diabetes. It might even increase the risk of de novo kidney diseases",</i>​ explained Fouque.</p>
        <p>"<i>To put it in a nutshell: To recommend a high-protein diet to an overweight diabetes patient may indeed result in loss of weight, but also in a severe loss of kidney function. We want one, but we also get the other."</i>​</p>
        <p>The experts added it is high time that the diabetes population and the general public are warned. "<i>By advising people - especially those with a high risk for chronic kidney disease, namely patients with diabetes, obese people, people with a solitary kidney and probably even elderly people - to eat a protein-rich diet, we are ringing the death bell for their kidney health and bringing them a big step closer to needing renal replacement therapy</i>​,” said Fouque. </p>

          <h3>‘The higher the intake, the faster the decline’​</h3>
          <p>The studies published in <i>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</i>​ included an analysis of 4,837 Dutch patients aged 60–80 years with a history of heart attack. This showed a strictly linear association between daily protein intake and decline in kidney function. <i>“The higher the intake, the faster the decline,” </i>​it concluded.</p>
          <p>The result of an epidemiological study conducted in South Korea pointed to the same direction: persons with the highest protein intake had a 1.3 higher risk of faster GFR (or glomerular filtration rate, a test to measure your level of kidney function and determine your stage of kidney disease loss).</p>
          <p>The analysis added it was unclear whether it makes any difference if the proteins are animal- or plant-based. “<i>The recommendation is to abstain in general from a high protein intake</i>​,” it said.</p>
