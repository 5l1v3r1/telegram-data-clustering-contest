      <h1>The Ritz-Carlton returns to Australia with its 100th property</h1>

      <p>The Ritz-Carlton has announced the opening of The Ritz-Carlton, Perth in the capital city of Western Australia.</p>
      <p>The opening of the hotel marks Ritz-Carlton’s 100th property and the luxury brand’s return to Australia.</p>
      <p>The new luxury hotel is part of the landmark development at Elizabeth Quay, overlooking the Swan River and Kings Park.</p>
      <p>The hotel said the design of the luxury new property draws inspiration from the natural beauty of Western Australia, and features a palette of earth tones, as well as “the use of luxurious natural materials”. For example, the 13-metre high ceilings and a chandelier in the lobby echo the cascading waters of the Karijini gorges in the state’s Pilbara region.</p>
      <p>The hotel offers 205 guestrooms, including 19 suites. The accommodation features views of either the city skyline or the Swan River, Frette bedlinens, and toiletries by British luxury brand Aspery.</p>
      <p>Guests with access to The Ritz-Carlton Club Lounge will enjoy mixology demonstrations, five culinary presentations per day, and “personalised excursions and journeys of wellbeing”. The club also features an outdoor al fresco terrace.</p>
      <p>As for dining options, its signature restaurant Hearth, helmed by Western Australian executive chef Jed Gerrard, offers “bold new interpretations” of the classic Australian barbecue; while the Hearth Lounge serves a menu of small plates, sweets, cocktails and afternoon tea.</p>
      <p>There’s also the rooftop bar Songbird which has a drink list featuring local spirits, craft beers, wines, and cocktails created in-house by a team of mixologists that focus on native Australia botanicals.</p>
      <p>Wellness facilities include a fitness centre, a yoga studio for stretching and meditation, a heated outdoor infinity pool, as well as The Ritz-Carlton Spa, Perth with four treatment rooms.</p>
      <p>In terms of meeting facilities, The Ritz-Carlton, Perth has 2,000 sqm of conference space with a team of staff available to help plan the event. The 550-sqm Elizabeth Quay Ballroom is available as a single space or three smaller rooms, while the Bell Tower and Swan River rooms are also customisable with views over the Elizabeth Quay.</p>
      <p>“We are thrilled for the opening of The Ritz-Carlton, Perth, and are very pleased to see the continued expansion of our portfolio of luxury brands in Australia,” said Victor Clavell, area vice president luxury Asia Pacific excluding China, Marriott International.</p>
      <p>“Affluent Australian and international tourists traveling to Western Australia are increasingly seeking enriching experiences, and this opening reflects our continued commitment to provide those travellers with opportunities to explore destinations like Perth.”</p>
