        <b>Spanish giants Sevilla are considering a winter move for Ghanaian youngster Mohammed Salisu, GHANASoccernet.com can exclusively report.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following the departure of Fernando Calero to RCD Espanyol, Salisu became a starter for Real Valladolid, partnering Kiko Olivas at the heart of defense.</p>
      <p>His impressive performances for the Castile and León side so far in 2019-20 campaign have prompted interest from several clubs across Europe.</p>
      <p>According to a grapevine source, Sevilla are preparing an offer of €12 million to snatch the 20-year-old guardsman from the the Madrid-based outfit.</p>
      <p>Ramón Verdejo 'Monchi', who is the Sporting Director of the Andalusians, is reported to be keen on landing the budding defender in the forthcoming January transfer winter window.</p>
      <p>Salisu has made 12 appearances and netted one goal for Real Valladolid in the ongoing La Liga campaign.</p>
      <p>He was called up for Ghana's 2021 Africa Cup of Nations double-header qualifiers but withdrew from the squad due to injury.</p>
