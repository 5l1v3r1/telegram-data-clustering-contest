      <p>Manitoba’s chief medical examiner has called an inquest into the fatal shooting of a Sudanese man in Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>Dr. John Younes will examine the circumstances leading to the death of Machuar Madut, who was 42, as well as determine if there are ways to prevent similar deaths in the future.</p>
      <p>Mr. Madut, who fled war-torn Sudan in the early 2000s with his wife and children, was fatally shot in February by police during an emergency call about a man with a hammer who was causing a disturbance.</p>
      <p>The Council of South Sudanese Community of Manitoba Inc. said at the time that Mr. Madut had been struggling with mental-health issues that resulted from his separation from his children and family.</p>
      <p>The shooting prompted a demonstration from people who said the incident highlighted the need for better relations between police and people of colour.</p>
      <p>A date and location for the inquest will be set later by the chief judge of Manitoba’s provincial court.</p>
