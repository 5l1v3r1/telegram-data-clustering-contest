They must guarantee freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and ensure that the rights of members of minority ethnic groups in Sidama are fully protected,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.<br/>“The referendum comes at an especially tense time when violence based on ethnic differences is breaking out all over the country and people are being killed simply for expressing their opinions.”<br/>No official death toll has been published from the clashes in July when protests broke out following the postponement of the plebiscite, but Sidama activist groups put the figure at almost 170.<br/>Campaigners are calling for a separate state for the Sidama ethnic group, which is currently part of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s Region. The Ethiopian constitution requires the government to organize a referendum for any ethnic group that requests a separate state.<br/>Public Document<br/><b>For more info or to arrange an interview please contact Amnesty Press Office:<br/></b>+44 20 7413 5566<br/>email: press@amnesty.org<br/>twitter: @amnestypress</blockquote>
