      <p>Amid the information overload, it may help, even at the risk of reductionism, to offer a super-distillation of the advice on how to live life.</p>
      <p>So, as a thought experiment, I reflected on my 1,538 <i>How To Do Life</i> posts here on PsychologyToday.com to identify what, for each of life’s seven core components, is the single idea that has been most helpful across the 5,700 <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/career">career</a> and personal advising clients I’ve had the privilege of serving. Here they are:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Career</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Musts more than passion. I</i>t's widely asserted that following your passion is key to career contentment. But my clients have been more likely to find career contentment by pursuing work that meets as many<i> job basics</i> as possible: decent pay, reasonable commute, good boss and co-workers, ethical work, and learning opportunities. And those are more likely to be found away from the fields that many people are passionate about: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition">sports</a>, music, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/environment">the environment</a>, fashion, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/politics">politics</a>. Supply/demand means that, except if you're a star, you'll have a hard time getting hired and, if you defy the odds, you're likely to be paid poorly and/or work long hours.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Relationships</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Accept or leave.</i> As any psychotherapist or relationship counselor knows, foundationally changing a person is difficult. More often, romantic partners and even close platonic friends are wise to, yes, work on some self-improvement, for example, reducing or eliminating <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction">substance abuse</a>, being neater around the house, and listening better, but more, to accept each other’s fundamental nature, for example, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">sex</a> drive, work ethic, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intelligence">intelligence</a>. If you find a person’s foundational characteristics anathema, perhaps after a bit of effort at improvement, it may be wise to cut your losses. There <i>are </i>many fish in the sea and sometimes, swimming solo is wisest of all.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Money</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Save on housing and on higher <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/education">education</a>. </i>By far, those are most people’s largest expenses and, fortunately, there are ways to save big on both with little or no decrement to your life.</p>
      <p>Regarding housing, one way to save a fortune is to buy or rent in a dicey neighborhood. With just reasonable precautions, you’re about as safe as in a neighborhood that can cost vastly more. Over a lifetime, the savings can easily be in six if not seven figures.</p>
      <p>Regarding higher education, yes, brand-name matters but that must be viewed only as a plus, not a dispositive factor. Sure, if you can get into Harvard or Stanford, you probably should go. But otherwise, as an undergraduate, it can be wise to start and perhaps finish community college, or return there for post-bachelor's career training. At community colleges, instructors are hired and promoted mainly on their teaching ability not on arcane research <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/productivity">productivity</a>. That gets you a better education at a much lower cost. Yes, a degree from a community college or from No-Name State may require you to make more effort to land a good job, but that effort can well be worth the fortune in savings on higher education expenses.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emotional Health</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Suppress and distract. </i>Easy problems can be thought through, processed. But most emotional problems that send people to the therapist are quite recalcitrant. Of course, severe mental illness should be addressed by a professional, but garden-variety <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> and angst may well be addressed by suppression: After briefly considering if there’s a solution, it may be best to suppress the anxiety-causing thought and distract yourself. Instead of self-absorption, focus on your work, helping others, creative outlet, etc. That tends to atrophy the brain neurons associated with the anxiety-causing thoughts. I have not found the adage true that suppression results in only short-term benefit, that like in Whack-a-Mole, if you push down one problem, two pop up elsewhere.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Physical health</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Within limits, accept your body. </i>95 percent of dieters gain all the weight back and often more, and yo-yoing is dangerous. Unless you're morbidly obese, it may be wise to accept the weight your body seems to want to be, its so-called set point. Yes, try to moderate your eating but <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/forgiveness">forgive</a> yourself the occasional cheat. You’ll probably end up healthier and happier, not caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of feeling deprived or feeling <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/guilt">guilt</a>-ridden.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Recreation</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Focus on creative outlet. </i>Too many people’s core recreations involve <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol">alcohol</a> or drug abuse. Having seen so much damage caused by those, I so wish that more of them would find their pleasure in creative outlet: whether acting, music, art, writing, comedy, magic, whatever, solo or as part of a team. Even if you’re not creative, a behind-the-scenes role such as stage manager for a community theater, researcher or editor for an author, crew assistant on a sailboat, or roadie for a band can be great fun without violating your body or hurting family, friends, coworkers, and creating accident victims.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The life well-led</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Focus on contribution. </i>I’ll admit that my own behavior is extreme—I work 60 to 70 hours a week and wouldn’t have it any other way. I do that because I’ve become convinced that the life well-led is about maximizing contribution. Sure, I enjoy watching movies, hiking with my doggie, and hanging out as much as the next person, but I force myself, yes force myself, for said 60 to 70 hours a week, to prioritize contribution over pleasure. While it’s unrealistic of me to expect most of you to do the same, I couldn’t write an article on my top tips without mentioning that one.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The takeaway</b>
      </p>
      <p>Those are my top seven. Want to add any of them to your own favorite tips on how to do life?</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Your Reader in Pennsylvania on November 19, 2019 - 8:22am</p>
      <p>...include these:</p>
      <p>PARENTING</p>
      <p>Avoid both helicopter and tiger parenting.</p>
      <p>With the world being a competitive and dangerous place, it's understandable that parents want to give their kids every leg up and every protection. Helicopter and tiger parenting, while polar opposites on the leniency/strictness spectrum, stem from the same attitude that kids need their parents to, dare I say it, micromanage their lives to survive and succeed.</p>
      <p>While both approaches work in the short term, over the long haul, they make kids experience more anxiety and depression and less contentment and efficacy. Plus, helicopter and tiger parenting is hard on the parents as well as the kids -- moms and dads deserve a life, too.</p>
      <p>So for the sake of your kids' and your own happiness and efficacy, take a balanced, nuanced approach to parenting, in which, yes, you have Zero Tolerance for the Big Stuff like sex, drugs, and violence, but leeway for the Small Stuff like fashion, music, and even sports and academics. For example, you can require your kids to earn at least a B average, but it's up to them to try for an A. Or, you can let your kids wear what they want to, but not allow clothing that suggests belonging to gangs or hate groups.</p>
      <p>FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND LOVERS</p>
      <p>Surround yourself with people who bring out the best in you.</p>
      <p>If a family member, friend, or lover is bringing you down, screw up your nerve and excise that person from your life. It may hurt in the short term, but be the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>And speaking of family, keep in mind that you shouldn't reflexively involve yourself with people "because they're family." Your time, money, and energy may be better spent elsewhere.</p>
      <p>When it comes to lovers, prioritize kindness, compatibility, and freedom from fatal flaws over looks and status.</p>
      <p>POLITICS</p>
      <p>The truth lies in between the extremes.</p>
      <p>Your city and state, and the USA overall, best serve the citizenry by a balance of conservative and liberal policies. That's because too much liberalism means redistributing resources from those with the greatest potential to benefit to those with the greatest deficits, more focus on "we the peopleS" vs. "we the people," and more government intrusion into our lives...and too much conservatism means that people who struggle to survive and succeed due to circumstances beyond their control are left to struggle, that people and corporations feel emboldened to do things like pollute and shortchange people, and that government fail at its core mission of protecting society.</p>
      <p>So, a middle ground with a reasonable social safety net, reasonable military and law enforcement spending, and reasonable taxes and regulations is most likely the right approach.</p>
