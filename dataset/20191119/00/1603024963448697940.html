      <p>Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar hinted against bringing a legislation to reserve 75 per cent of private sector jobs in the state for local youths, a key poll promise of the BJP's coalition partner the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP).</p>
      <p>Talking to reporters in the evening after chairing a Cabinet meeting here, Khattar said as per existing rules, giving 75 per cent jobs to local youths is a pre-condition for any CLU (Change of Land Use).</p>
      <p>"But the only thing is that so far we don't have a mechanism for its enforcement. For enforcement of this mechanism, we will sit and decide how to work this out," he said.</p>
      <p>The chief minister said data has been sought from the private industry on the number of jobs going to local youths.</p>
      <p>"We have sought data from industry to see what is the actual position. Out of the number of people engaged as unskilled labour, skilled labour and semi-skilled labour, we will see how many are from Haryana and how many are from outside the state," he said.</p>
      <p>Recently, Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyanat Chautala told the state Assembly that the coalition government would bring a bill in the next session of the House to provide 75 per cent of private sector jobs to local youths, a key promise of his party, the JJP.</p>
      <p>Khattar said to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of India, a one-day special session of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha will be held on November 26.</p>
      <p>The chief minister said there will be a special discussion on the Constitution in this special session.</p>
      <p>Apart from this, on the same day, a bill will be brought to amend a section of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, to allow devolution of powers to gram sabha to ban liquor sale within the local area of a gram panchayat.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question on drug issue, Khattar said that apart from the government, de-addiction centres are also being run by the private sector.</p>
      <p>He said as per his assurance given in the last Assembly session, necessary infrastructure and staff facilities are being provided to these de-addiction centres.</p>
      <p>The chief minister said a state task force has already been constituted to crack the whip on drug peddlers and now a task force will also be formed at the district level.</p>
      <p>On the stubble burning issue, he said five industries of Haryana purchase stubble for energy production or other purposes.</p>
      <p>A major ethanol industry is being set up in Panipat by the Indian Oil Corporation, Khattar added.</p>
