        <b>You’d have to be a pretty trusting Coronation Street viewer not to be suspicious of newcomer nanny Jade Rowan (Lottie Henshall), who has been seen secretly scheming against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fiz/">Fiz Stape</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennie-mcalpine/">Jennie McAlpine</a>) since arriving to help look after troubled Hope.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And in upcoming episodes, she will step up her manipulation, using Hope as a weapon to unsettle Fiz and Tyrone (Alan Halsall) – with dramatic consequences. And as another fire takes hold, is young Hope really to blame?</p>
      <p>We have seen flame happy Hope cause trouble with fire before but since her behaviour began to improve, Fiz and Tyrone had hoped that the troubles were behind them and things would start to get calmer. But not with Jade around, whose mysterious vendetta brings chaos and fear to the household.</p>

      <p>When Fiz refuses to throw Hope a fireworks party, Hope plays up and Tyrone worries that they should give in in case their refusal leads to her misbehaving again.</p>

      <p>Fiz reluctantly gives in but as the party gets underway, a fire starts to spread in the back yard, with Hope watching, transfixed.</p>

      <p>It is automatically assumed that Hope must be behind the fire and Fiz can no longer doubt that she was behind the blaze at the factory. However, Jack Webster tells the parents that the fire had already started when he and Hope entered the back yard – the plot thickens. With Fiz and Tyrone believing the worst of her, is Hope truly to blame? Or are we seeing Jade’s true colours as she sets out to frame a child?</p>
      <p>Fiz admits to Tyrone that she worried he would leave her if he knew how bad Hope’s behaviour was and he comforts her, with the butter-wouldn’t-melt Jade offering to babysit so they can have a night out together.</p>
      <p>As Fiz decides she needs to be more disciplined with Hope, scheming Jade privately confides in Evelyn Plummer (Maureen Lipman) that she is worried about Fiz’s treatment of Hope. Later, when Fiz discovers a lighter in Hope’s doll, she freaks out and angrily smashes her daughter’s iPad, leaving everyone concerned.</p>
      <p>As Hope returns to school by the end of the week, Fiz thanks Jade for her help and then tells her that she will no longer be needed. But what tricks does Jade have up her sleeve?</p>
