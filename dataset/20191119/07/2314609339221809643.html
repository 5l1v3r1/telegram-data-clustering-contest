      <p>Jetstar pilots have taken a step towards striking during the busy Christmas period.</p>
      <p>The Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) has made a successful application to the Fair Work Commission for a protected industrial action ballot. Elections Australia will ask Jetstar pilots if they approve of taking industrial action ranging from refusing to do overtime up to 24-hour stoppages.</p>

      <p>The action would be lawful because it is during a period of enterprise bargaining for a new wages agreement.</p>
      <p>AFAP executive director Simon Lutton said the ballot was a step towards stoppages from early to mid-December. If the industrial action goes ahead, it would be the first strike involving Jetstar pilots.</p>
      <p>Jetstar pilots are unhappy they are paid less than comparable pilots working for other airlines including at Qantas, Virgin and Tiger.</p>
      <p>"If we are not making reasonable progress in our negotiations we will explore other options and one of those is the potential for protected industrial action," Mr Lutton said.</p>
      <p>"It is not something we take lightly. We are still hopeful we will not need to take it, but we are putting in the next steps if it is required."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Jetstar said it was disappointed the AFAP "has taken this step this early in negotiations". "We remain committed to reaching a new agreement to support the great work our people do every day, but not any cost," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Lutton said potential action could cross paths with the busy Christmas period. The right to strike would remain valid for three months.</p>
      <p>"We would be able to take action after giving three or four days notice from early to mid-December," he said.</p>
      <p>"It could take place for any period after that if we haven't made sufficient progress in pursuit of a fairer deal. This is about having the option to do it if we need to."</p>
      <p>The union will continue meeting with the company with the next bargaining negotiations scheduled for November 29.</p>
      <p>Mr Lutton said about 680 of Jetstar's workforce of 850 pilots were members of his union.</p>
