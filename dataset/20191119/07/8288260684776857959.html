      <p>The January transfer window is nearing with the one-month period offering a timely chance for clubs to beef up their squad as they bid to keep their season afloat.</p>
      <p>
        <i>With that in mind, here are all the latest transfer rumours surrounding <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> and their rivals...</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Leeds sent Villa warning</h4>
      <p>Leeds United have been warned to expect ‘vultures to come swooping’ for Kalvin Phillips once the transfer window reopens.</p>
      <p>The midfielder was a summer target for Villa after Dean Smith’s side achieved promotion.</p>
      <p>With Phillips having excelled in his debut campaign under Marcelo Bielsa – earning himself a  place in the Championship’s team of the year – Villa were among a number of admirers from the Premier League.</p>
      <p>But they couldn’t agree a fee with Leeds to take the 23-year-old to Villa Park and looked elsewhere.</p>

      <h4>Everton fans on Morelos</h4>
      <p>Everton fans have had their say after the Toffees were urged to sign Villa-linked striker Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p>Villa have been claimed to hold an interest in the Rangers forward who is enjoying the most prolific campaign of his career at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>He’s scored 22 times this season in just 26 appearances, leading many to tip the Colombia international for a move to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith has hinted Villa will considering adding to their options upfront when the transfer window reopens in January but Darren Bent believes it’s Everton who should swoop for Morelos.</p>

      <h4>Championship trial</h4>
      <p>Villa are reportedly one of a number of clubs chasing highly rated Carlisle United defender Jarrad Branthwaite.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has only this season broken into the first team at Brunton Park, but is already turning heads with a number of impressive performances.</p>
      <p>According to Football Insider, Villa, along with several other top flight clubs have been monitoring Branthwaite ahead of a potential move in the January window.</p>
      <p>The central defender has started the last five League Two games and was even given the honour of the captain's armband in a recent league fixture.</p>

      <h4>Man United drop transfer hint</h4>
      <p>Ed Woodward says Manchester United have a ‘clear vision’ for recruitment – and hinted the club are ready to spend amid reports linking them with Villa midfielder John McGinn.</p>
      <p>United were first credited with an interest in McGinn in the summer transfer window after the Scotland international played a key role in Villa’s promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old signed a new five-year deal at Villa Park ahead of the first game of the season but it is understood United have continued to monitor his performances.</p>
      <p>Old Trafford executive vice-chairman Woodward addressed the New York Stock Exchange to inform shareholders of results from the first quarter of the financial year.</p>

      </p>
      <h4>Arsenal agent drops bombshell</h4>
      <p>Lucas Torreira's agent has declared that the Arsenal midfielder is "no longer at ease" under Unai Emery, putting his long-term Emirates future into doubt.</p>
      <p>The Uruguay international was signed from Sampdoria in a £26million deal in 2018, and was seen as something of a coup after impressing at the World Cup.</p>
      <p>But after being a regular last term, he hasn’t been first choice for Emery so far in 2019-20.</p>
      <p>Torreira, 23, has often seen Matteo Guendouzi, Dani Ceballos and Joe Willock preferred by the Spaniard, as well as former skipper Granit Xhaka.</p>

      <h4>Everton transfer claim made</h4>
      <p>Former Everton director of football Steve Walsh has revealed the Toffees rejected to sign Harry Maguire and Andy Robertson during his tenure - for a combined fee of £20million.</p>
      <p>Maguire became the most expensive defender in history when Manchester United paid £80million to sign him from Leicester over the summer.</p>
      <p>Robertson has gone on to establish himself as one of the world's premier full-backs since joining Liverpool from Hull and helped the Reds to a sixth European crown last term.</p>
      <p>And Walsh claims - while the duo were both at Hull - he offered Everton the chance to sign the pair - but the Toffees hierarchy decided against the move.</p>

      <h4>Man City to hijack Arsenal move</h4>
      <p>Manchester City are weighing up a bid for Red Bull Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano who was considered by Arsenal in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Premier League champions are struggling in defence having lost Aymeric Laporte until the New Year.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's cover has not impressed with John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi both making errors which could push him into the transfer market.</p>
      <p>The Catalan has said he won't buy in January, but should injuries force his hand he wants to sign players who can benefit the club beyond his tenure.</p>
