        <b>There is set to be stiff competition for the signature of Genk’s Sander Berge with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> joining Liverpool and Napoli in the race to sign the midfielder.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has impressed in the centre of midfield for the Belgian side and Norway over the last two years, becoming a regular starter for club and country.</p>
      <p>Berge played against both Liverpool and Napoli in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> this season and did enough to catch the eye of both the English and Italian opponents.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-ready-to-compete-with-liverpool-and-napoli-for-genks/2uler5b4q64t1g9fpku9kh6w1">Goal</a> reports that Chelsea are also very interested in the midfielder and are keeping track of any change in his situation at Genk.</p>
      <p>The Blues are still under a transfer ban and are currently not able to sign players in January, but this could change after a Court Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Wednesday as the club appeal for the ban to be lifted.</p>

      <p>If Chelsea are not successful in having their ban lifted then Liverpool or Napoli could steal a march on them and snap up the Norwegian in January.</p>
      <p>The 6′ 3″ midfielder has given Liverpool something of a head start in the race to sign him by saying that he would like to play at Anfield ‘as often as possible.’</p>
      <p>‘Playing at Anfield is a dream for everyone in the world, and not least for Norwegians,’ Berge tolf TV2.</p>
      <p>‘Liverpool are the best team [at the moment] and have the most fans.</p>
      <p>‘So I could certainly like to play at Anfield as often as possible.’</p>
      <p>Genk technical director Dimitri De Conde has been open about the interest in his player, but says he would rather hold on to him until the summer.</p>
      <p>‘Napoli are interested in Sander and it’s is a possibility,’ De Conde told Radio Punto Nuovo.</p>
      <p>‘We also know Liverpool follow him carefully. Klopp spoke to the boy after the Anfield game, congratulating him on the performance.</p>
      <p>‘In Italy there are clubs that follow Berge and Napoli could be one of these, but to date we have no concrete offers on the table. It could even change in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>‘Berge to Napoli in January? We don’t know. We are currently fighting for our seasonal goals and we are in a complicated situation.</p>

      <p>‘Our intention is to hold on to Sander until the end of the season, but we can’t make any predictions. If the big clubs come knocking at our door, we will have to start negotiations, just as the agent has to do.</p>
      <p>‘These are situations we can’t predict, we’re focused on our season, hoping to keep Sander until May. Then if a top club like Napoli is serious, we will sit at the same table to negotiate, it is logical.’</p>
