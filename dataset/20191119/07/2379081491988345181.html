      <p>The 4 Wellbeing Projects will greatly improve residents’ way of life by providing a greener, healthier environment and by encouraging participation in cultural and sporting life, in line with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030. These four projects are transformative and are part of a massive development plan for the capital, highlighting the Kingdom’s leadership in sustainable urbanization and environmental management. The US$23 billion government investment, along with an estimated US$15 billion of private sector contribution in the four projects, will help transform the capital and enhance the wellbeing of its 7 million citizens.</p>
      <p>Eng. Ibrahim Al-Shayeh, General Manager of Strategic Urban Planning at RCRC and Chairman of the Symposium, said: “Cities are at the forefront of global efforts to stabilize climate heating, while providing a quality of life to growing populations. Through events like the ‘Riyadh: The Sustainable City’ Symposium, and many more to come, our aim is to plan and implement a future for Riyadh that is smart, resilient and sustainable, working in harmony with the environment, while at the same time enhancing the wellbeing of citizens.”</p>
      <p>Dr. David Griggs, a Professor at the Sustainable Development Institute, Monash University, who led the discussion groups, said: “Every one of these Wellbeing Projects is quite extraordinary. Riyadh will be transformed in ways that you and I can’t fully understand. They will transform this city not just in its infrastructure and facilities, but will transform health, culture and the very way citizens live their lives.”</p>
      <p>“Collectively, these 4 projects will make Riyadh a phenomenally attractive city in which to live, to work and to visit”, he added.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Maria Vassilakou, former Vice-Mayor and Deputy Governor of Vienna, commented: “The 4 Wellbeing Projects will provide a huge opportunity for local job creation, particularly those jobs for young people and women in Riyadh City.”</p>
      <p>Finally, Professor Michael Koh, Executive Fellow at the Centre for Livable Cities in Singapore, who was a delegate at the event, said: “This event has been a successful opportunity to share knowledge. It has been a wonderful example in global partnership, in making cities sustainable and livable.”</p>
