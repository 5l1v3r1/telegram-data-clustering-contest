      <p>It is now that Gowarikar has decided to speak about the uncanny comparisons and he expressed how it is not a thing to worry about.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the tabloid Mumbai Mirror, “That’s understandable because the last film that comes out, stays in our recent memory. So, Jodhaa Akbar was immediately compared to Mughal-E-Azam, Bajirao Mastani to Jodhaa Akbar and Padmaavat to Bahubali. That’s nothing to be worried about.”</p>
      <p>“Also, we are still in the era of the Peshwas in Panipat, which revolves around Bajirao’s next-generation—his son, Nana Saheb Peshwa, his brother Chimaji Appa’s son Sadashiv Rao Bhau and his second son with Mastani, Shamsher Bahadur. So, the costumes and their palace, remain the same but the story is very different,” he added.</p>
      <p>Set to hit the big screens on December 6, The film stars Arjun, Sanjay, Kriti Sanon in lead roles and revolves around the third battle of <i>Panipat</i>.</p>
