      <h1>Roger Cook bends on dying law changes, says he has listened on 'final package'</h1>

      <p>The state government has blinked over its draft euthanasia legislation and will back a handful of amendments in the hope the upper house will sign off on the controversial laws by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Roger Cook will announce a "final package" of six changes to the laws to clarify questions and concerns posed by medical professionals including the Australian Medical Association.</p>

      <p>These will include a requirement that the two doctors who sign off on a terminally ill patient's request to die be independent.</p>
      <p>Doctors will also be able to have regard to a terminally ill patient's medical history.</p>
      <p>The state government and euthanasia supporters aggressively opposed changes to the laws in the lower house from MPs across the political spectrum who both supported and opposed the legislation.</p>
      <p>Debate recommenced in the Legislative Council on Tuesday afternoon as MPs worked their way through a raft of amendments already on the notice paper.</p>
      <p>The six previously tabled amendments will mean:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A medical consultation is the only avenue to make an initial request for voluntary assisted dying;</li>
        <li>It is mandatory for both practitioners to report the palliative care options available to the patient to the Voluntary Assisted Dying Board;</li>
        <li>It is possible for a family member to be one witness to a patientâ€™s written declaration;</li>
        <li>Medical practitioners will no longer be liable for a fine if they fail to lodge the first request form; and</li>
        <li>It is explicit that a doctor who acts without reasonable care and skill will not be protected from claims of negligence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>"The McGowan government has listened to the arguments surrounding the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill, we have debated with members of parliament and consulted with key stakeholders to produce this final package of amendments," Mr Cook said.</p>
      <p>"These amendments are the result of considered collaboration and have the support of the Australian Medical Association WA Branch. I look forward to the active engagement of the AMA (WA) in the implementation phase of the Bill on the event that it is passed by Parliament.</p>
      <p>"We know there is strong support in Western Australia for laws that legalise voluntary assisted dying so it is important we provide clarity and reassurance for those who will have direct involvement in these decisions."</p>
