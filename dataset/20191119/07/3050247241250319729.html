      <h1>LocalEthereum Adds Bitcoin as LocalBitcoins Bows to Finland Regulators</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:59:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:59</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>One of the main competitors of P2P Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/localbitcoins">LocalBitcoins</a> has taken even more of its market share as the Finnish company seeks regulatory compliance.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://blog.localcryptos.com/announcing-localcryptos/">blog post</a> on Nov. 19, LocalCryptos, formerly LocalEthereum, said it had completed the pivotal step of adding support for Bitcoin as well as Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>).</p>
      <h3>LocalEthereum becomes LocalCryptos</h3>
      <p>“The platform is a one-stop shop for fiat-to-crypto ramps worldwide, beginning with BTC and ETH,” the blog post reads, describing the move as a “large milestone.”</p>
      <p>In the future, more cryptocurrencies will join its offering: </p>
      <blockquote>“LocalCryptos will list some of the most popular Ethereum-based tokens over time. We’ll develop a new smart contract to handle ERC20s, and, in the more distant future, ERC721s.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Finland: LocalBitcoins is “official virtual currency provider”</h3>
      <p>The move comes roughly a week after LocalBitcoins <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/localbitcoins-receives-finnish-fsa-virtual-currency-provider-license">announced</a> its registration with regulators in its home country of Finland. Part of a multi-year scheme to formalize its compliance, LocalBitcoins is now an official virtual currency provider in the eyes of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority or FIN-FSA.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/localbitcoin-loses-traders-after-cash-trading-ban-not-very-local">reported</a>, the platform’s metamorphosis has alienated many users, who found they were no longer able to transact anonymously. </p>
      <p>Executives had incrementally phased out ways of trading on LocalBitcoins without revealing one’s identity, with cash trades now banned and ID submission obligatory. </p>
      <p>By contrast, LocalCryptos stays away from such requirements, operating as a non-custodial resource under which no financial liability is taken on.</p>
      <p>The setup allows the platform to retain features that LocalBitcoins has shunned. When cash trades disappeared, LocalCryptos turned the decision into a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/localethereum-woos-localbitcoins-traders-after-platform-reportedly-bans-cash-trading">PR opportunity</a> on social media. </p>
      <p>Other operators in the space, such as Bisq, also saw a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-dex-bisq-sees-record-volume-after-localbitcoins-bans-cash">surge in popularity</a> during the change, which occurred in June this year.</p>
