      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Justice Qazi Faez Isa’s attorney has contended that the Supreme Court judge’s spouse had paid more income tax than Prime Minister Imran Khan. Babar Sattar resuming his arguments before the 10-judge full court led by Justice Umar Ata Bandial compared two years tax record of the premier with the apex court judge’s wife who has been alleged of being dependent on his husband to purchase foreign properties. The counsel told the court that Justice Isa’s spouse had paid income tax amounting to Rs134,000 and Rs147,000 in two years, while PM Khan paid Rs10,003. Sattar also referred to the federal government’s reply wherein details of Justice Isa’s spouse tax details had been mentioned. When the counsel was explaining about the applicability of tax laws in the case, Justice Bandial said that the fundamental question before the court was not about the tax but also related to the source of funds about the purchase of foreign properties. Justice Faisal Arab noted that there was an allegation of concealment and purchase of properties in violation of money</p>
      <p>laundering laws. The counsel maintained that the presidential reference stated that the SC judge violated section 116 of Income Tax Ordinance and did not disclose family members’ properties in his wealth statement.   He also read out incumbent FBR Chairman Shabbar Zaidi’s Article wherein it was stated that there was no link between income tax and wealth statement.</p>
      <p>A Supreme Court judge noted that if tax authorities had objection over top court judge’s wealth statement, it should have issued a notice and that if no notice was issued then the matter had ended. Another judge noted that wealth statement would disclose the properties, which are owned by the taxpayer.  He said that if someone does not disclose his property what would be the penal consequence. The hearing of the case was adjourned until Tuesday.</p>
