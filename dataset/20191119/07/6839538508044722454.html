      <p>Summer is fast approaching, and VACSWIM has 12,000 students to teach. But they’ll have some help from our own Olympic swimmer Kyle Chalmers.</p>
      <p>VACSWIM launched its summer campaign on Tuesday, with Olympic gold medallist Kyle Chalmers as its new ambassador.</p>
      <p>The annual program will teach water safety to 12,000 primary school-aged children at 120 beaches and pools over the summer school holidays.</p>

      <p>Learning to swim is just not an option for young South Australians, Chalmers said.</p>
      <p>“As an Aussie kid it’s important to be confident around water,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If being a part of this program can help prevent drownings and encourage kids to get out, safely and have fun in the water, then that’s a wonderful thing.”</p>
      <p>Brianna McLay, 8, has done VACSWIM and enjoyed demonstrating water safety yesterday when she “rescued” her brother, carefully going through the process.</p>
      <p>“I really like going in the water,” she said.</p>
