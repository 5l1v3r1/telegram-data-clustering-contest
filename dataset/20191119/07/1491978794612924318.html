        <i>It turned out to be because a neighbour’s cars had been stolen using keys taken from their house</i>

      <p>
        <b>We have just been sent a letter by Direct Line telling us that it is not prepared to renew our home insurance as our property no longer meets its “risk requirements”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We have had no claims on the household insurance, hold two car policies with Direct Line, have no financial problems and live at the top of a steep hill.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Concerned that my ID has been compromised, I checked my credit rating but it is excellent. Direct Line refuses to tell us the reason for the decision</b>
        <b>, so we cannot be totally frank with another insurer when we try to find cover elsewhere.</b>

      <p>Direct Line would not tell me the reason, either – all it would say is that your home no longer fits its underwriting criteria. However, a bit more delving revealed that a neighbour had had their home broken into, and their cars stolen using the keys taken from the house. I suspect this is the reason you have been dumped. Because you also insure your cars with Direct Line, the firm would have faced a double payout if you suffered the same fate.</p>
      <p>On a positive note, Direct Line says that you do not have to tell a new insurer you have been refused cover, which would have made getting affordable cover very difficult.</p>
      <p>House break-ins for car keys have become a big problem. It emerged last week that thieves are using blowtorches on front door locks to enable them to get in. There’s been a spate of this in Bradford and, more recently, Stockport.</p>
