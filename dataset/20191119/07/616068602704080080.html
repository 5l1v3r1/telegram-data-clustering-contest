      <p>Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex has shut down a string of rumours printed by British tabloid newspapers in new court documents.<br/><br/>Meghan is suing The Mail on Sunday and its parent company, Associated Newspapers, after the outlet published a private letter the Duchess wrote to her father, Thomas Markle.<br/><br/>According to the British royal and her husband, Prince Harry, the move was "unlawful" and done "in an intentionally destructive manner" to manipulate the audience in a smear campaign against the former Suits actress.<br/><br/>However, according to a new report from Byline Investigates, the Duchess hits out at the publication for printing the heavily redacted, private note in papers submitted by Schillings solicitors, writing: "The omitted or suppressed parts of the letter amount to almost half of the actual contents.<br/><br/>"The omitted parts demonstrating the claimant's care for her father and others, as well as her concern about the U.K. tabloid media exploiting her father."<br/><br/>They also condemn the publication for printing a private letter from Meghan to her father without her consent and editing it to portray a "deliberately inaccurate picture of her relationship with her father."<br/><br/>The lawsuit also shuts down the "untrue and offensive" rumour that Meghan did not invite her mother to her baby shower and explains she was unable to attend due to work commitments.<br/><br/>Further rumours referenced in the lawsuit relate to the couple's newly renovated home in Windsor, which was alleged to have a $6,500 copper bathtub, $650,000 of aircraft soundproofing, a yoga studio, a tennis court and guest wing - none of which exist, according to the legal documents.<br/><br/>Numerous other articles claiming Meghan grew up in a "gang-scarred" home near Compton; that the community kitchen she helped create a cookbook with had connections to jihadi terrorists; and that her favorite snack, avocado, is "fueling human rights abuses, drought and murder" are also denied.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Harry has filed papers against the owners of The Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking.</p>
