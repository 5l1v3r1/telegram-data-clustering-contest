      <h1>BBL spot beckons for rising Fraser-McGurk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:08:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:08</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Cherny</a></address>
      <p>Teen sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk couldn't quite get Victoria over the line at the MCG on Tuesday but he is set to give the new Melbourne Renegades coach something to think about ahead of the club's Big Bash League defence.</p>
      <p>Needing 13 to win from the final over bowled by South Australia's Cameron Valente, Fraser-McGurk, 17, and Jono Merlo, 20, whittled the equation down to three runs required to win from the last ball of the Vics' Marsh Cup one-day match against SA.</p>
      <p>However Fraser-McGurk was unable to capitalise on a leg-side full toss from Valente, with the youngsters only scampering through for a single, giving the Redbacks a one-run victory and denying Victoria what would have been the highest successful domestic one-day chase at the venue.</p>

      <p>Victoria finished at 5-321 after South Australia made 4-322 from their 50 overs.</p>
      <p>The result meant little, with both sides already eliminated from the title race after Queensland and Western Australia secured spots in next week's final in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Fraser-McGurk, who had made two domestic half-centuries in seven days since his Sheffield Shield debut last week, finished 41 not out from 34 balls.</p>

      <p>The Vics have a couple of Shield games to come before the BBL begins on December 17.</p>
      <p>Fraser-McGurk is contracted to the Renegades but will be away from early January on Australian under-19 duties.</p>
      <p>However Renegades captain Aaron Finch said Fraser-McGurk has been "bloody impressive" and would be in the mix to play for the Renegades at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>The Renegades are in a state of flux, with Finch revealing that the club would hold interviews on Wednesday as they seek to replace title-winning coach Andrew McDonald, who has joined the Australian national team as an assistant coach.</p>
      <p>Finch will sit in on the interviews. World Cup-winning coach Trevor Bayliss, former Renegades coach David Saker and domestic stalwart Michael Klinger are all in contention for the Renegades job according to industry sources. Klinger has also been linked to the vacant Australian selector's role.</p>
      <p>Chasing 323 to win on Tuesday, the Vics lost the early wickets of Sam Harper (duck) and Marcus Harris (nine), as Daniel Worrall struck twice.</p>
      <p>Finch and Peter Handscomb put on 147 for the third wicket before the Victorian skipper departed for 87, brilliantly caught by Valente, who took a diving one-handed screamer at mid-off.</p>
      <p>Finch was dropped on 57 by Alex Ross and took advantage to make his 21st List A century. He eventually fell to Adam Zampa for 119 from 123 balls.</p>
      <p>The Redbacks posted their massive total after winning the toss and electing to bat. SA were led by Callum Ferguson, who made 122 from 128 balls, in doing so surpassing Darren Lehmann as SA's most prolific run-scorer in domestic one-day cricket.</p>
      <p>Fellow veteran Tom Cooper blasted five fours and seven sixes en route to an unbeaten 81 from 46 balls, while Alex Carey made 50 from 62 deliveries. <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53bd5.html">Having starred two days earlier against NSW</a>, Peter Siddle went for 75 from 10 wicketless overs.</p>
      <p>Carey captained South Australia after Jake Lehmann, who led SA in their most recent match, was relegated to 12th man duties.</p>
      <p>Finch was meanwhile complimentary towards the MCG pitch after three thrilling domestic matches over the past week. Finch described the wicket as "brilliant."</p>
