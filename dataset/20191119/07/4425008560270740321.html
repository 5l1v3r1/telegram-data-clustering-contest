      <h1>SA govt calls for first-ever digital chief</h1>
      <h2>As CIO departs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/justin-hendry-1167397" target="_blank">Justin Hendry</a></address>
      <p>The South Australian government has issued a casting call for its inaugural whole-of-government chief digital officer in a bid to improve digital service delivery across the state.</p>
      <p>The Department of the Premier and Cabinet last week kicked off its <a href="https://iworkfor.sa.gov.au/page.php?AdvertID=486166&amp;source=23318">search</a> to secure an IT executive for the newly created role, which it says will lead the government’s digital strategies and initiative.</p>
      <p>It has created the role with the department’s ICT and digital government division to “more efficiently and effectively deliver secure and simple-to-use services to South Australians”.</p>
      <p>Reporting to executive director of ICT and digital government Eva Balan-Vnuk, the CDO will oversee the development and implementation of a digital government strategy.</p>
      <p>This will require providing “expert leadership to the SA government” around the “digital capabilities, standards and policies” and working with agencies to implement improvements.</p>
      <p>The senior executive will also take charge of the government’s “high-profile digital platforms and assets” and the expert teams continuously improving “design, security and integrity”.</p>
      <p>The search for DPC’s first-ever CDO comes just three months after chief information officer Abhishek Singh left the department to become a technology consultant at the University of Adelaide.</p>
      <p>Singh <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/sacked-sa-govt-cio-fronts-court-on-fraud-charges-482189">joined the department in January 2018</a> to replace former CIO Veronica Theriault, who was sacked over alleged dishonesty in relation to her job application, as well as abuse of public office.</p>
      <p>However, <i>iTnews</i> understands the new CDO role will not replace that of the CIO role, which is currently dually held by Eva Balan-Vnuk.</p>
      <p>DPC is offering a three-year contract worth up to $257,291 annually.</p>
      <p>The Queensland government also recently put out the call for its <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/queensland-govt-hunts-for-first-ever-digital-chief-531361">first-ever chief customer and digital officer</a> to ensure its online government services are world leading.</p>
