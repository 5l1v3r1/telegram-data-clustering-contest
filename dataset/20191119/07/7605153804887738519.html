        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 19 – Per Mertesacker has praised former Arsenal teammate Mikel Arteta and admitted that he would enjoy having him back at the Gunners.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Gunners defender, who now runs the club’s academy, played alongside Arteta for five years at the Emirates Stadium after they both arrived in the summer of 2011.</p>
      <p>Arteta then retired in 2016 and left to join Manchester City, working as Pep Guardiola’s assistant and playing a key role in the club’s back-to-back Premier League triumphs.</p>
      <p>He was also touted as a candidate to succeed Arsene Wenger in North London in 2018 and, with pressure upon Unai Emery rising, has been mentioned as a candidate to be the next manager at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mertesacker has now thrown his weight behind Arteta, praising his former colleague colleague and admitting he would love to work alongside him in the future.</p>
      <p>“I was his vice-captain at Arsenal and he trusted me. I was by his side during team meetings and we had a great bond. I’d love to work with him again, a top guy,” he told FourFourTwo.</p>
      <p>Mertesacker also praised former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was appointed last week as the new Head of Football Development at Fifa.</p>
      <p>“He has an aura – it’s difficult to explain. He demands a lot, but makes you feel comfortable, too. It’s about trust. In hard times, he was a rock protecting us. I’ll always be very grateful to him.”</p>
