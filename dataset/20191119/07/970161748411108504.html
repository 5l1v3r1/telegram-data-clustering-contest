        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a> is already back in the studio working on a second Jesus Is King album and, somehow, he’s managed to persuade Dr Dre to join him for the ride.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fans are still digesting the first installment of the gospel-inspired Jesus Is King, which was released just three weeks ago, but it seems Kanye’s creative juices are still flowing.</p>
      <p>Announcing the album’s sequel, the Gold Digger rapper shared a photo to Twitter on Monday with him looking rather serious in the recording studio with Dr Dre beside him, looking pretty excited and pointing at Ye.</p>
      <p>‘Ye and Dre Jesus is King Part II coming soon,’ Kanye captioned the image.</p>
      <p>It’s a shame Kanye doesn’t visibly share Dre’s enthusiasm but he has made his feelings on the NWA producer clear in the past. In a piece for Rolling Stone, Kanye once said: ‘Dre feels like God placed him here to make music.’</p>

      <p>Most fans welcomed the news and are looking forward to the prospect of the legendary producers cooking up music together.</p>
      <p>One of Kanye’s Twitter followers stated: ‘TWO OF THE GREATEST PRODUCERS OF ALL TIME. THIS IS AMAZING. WHAT.’</p>

      <p>Sharing Kanye’s newfound faith, another added: ‘THERE IS A GOD!!!!!!!’</p>
      <p>Praising the rapper’s calmer attitude of late, one said: ‘Kanye, I have seen such a positive transformation in you. You are absolutely amazing. Keep smiling and spreading the good word. You have picked yourself up and shown the world how strong you are. I am absolutely impressed and amazed. Keep up the great work.’</p>

      <p>It comes after the All Of The Lights rapper declared himself ‘the greatest artist God has ever created’, while attending Pastor Joel Osteen’s service in Houston on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Guess Ye’s own Sunday Service was taking a break that weekend.</p>
      <p>Speaking on-stage, Kanye said: ‘Jesus has won the victory.</p>
      <p>‘I told you about my arrogance and cockiness already. Now the greatest artist that God has ever created is now working for him.’</p>
      <p>A release date for Jesus Is King Part II is yet to be revealed but don’t hold your breath, the first album was delayed for weeks.</p>
