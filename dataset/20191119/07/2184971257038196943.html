      <p>No, this is not a game of political spot the difference, <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-18/what-issues-are-dominating-the-online-campaign/"><b>writes ITV News Trainee Fred Dimbleby</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The posts seen above are three ads the <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/topic/liberal-democrats/"><b>Liberal Democrats</b></a> ran in the early stages of this election campaign.</p>
      <p>The ads have similar messages and formats but are phrased slightly differently – testing certain wording and photos to find the most effective combination.</p>
      <p>We can see this testing because of a new tool available at this general election – the Facebook ad library.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-18/what-issues-are-dominating-the-online-campaign/"><b>Fred explains the different tactics the parties are using to promote their key messages and attack their rivals</b></a>.</p>

      <p>If there is one place in Northern Ireland where the community takes great pride in its boxing traditions it is North Belfast.</p>
      <p>British, Commonwealth, European and World titles are among the professional honours won by local fighters, but in just over three weeks’ time, the constituency will see a fight like no other.</p>
      <p>Political heavyweights will go head-to-head in the battle of the election – vying for a seat held by the DUP’s Nigel Dodds since 2001.</p>
      <p>So is the DUP deputy leader worried about losing a seat that has never fallen out of unionist hands?</p>
