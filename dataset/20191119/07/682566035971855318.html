      <p>Brisbane - <b>Steve Smith </b>insists he does not feel "hard done by" after the West Indies' <b>Nicholas Pooran</b> received a four-match ban for ball-tampering compared to the master Australian batsman's year-long suspension.</p>
      <p>The talented Pooran was last week suspended by the International Cricket Council for four Twenty20 internationals for "changing the condition of the ball" in a one-day match against Afghanistan in India.</p>
      <p>Smith and David Warner were exiled by Cricket Australia for a year, while Cameron Bancroft was suspended for nine months, for their part in a plot to use sandpaper to alter the ball during a Test against South Africa last year.</p>
      <p>Smith said he had no issues with the wide disparity in the punishments.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is different, every board is different, and the way they deal with certain issues," he told reporters ahead of the opening Test against Pakistan in Brisbane this week - his first Test at home since the tampering scandal.</p>
      <p>"For me, I copped it on the chin... it is what it is.</p>
      <p>"I don't feel hard done by. It was a long time ago now. I've moved past it and I'm focusing on the present," he added.</p>
      <p>Smith and Pooran played together for the Barbados Tridents and the former Australian skipper said he hoped his ex-teammate would learn from his mistake.</p>
      <p>"I know Nicholas, I've played a bit of cricket with him and he's a talented player and someone with a bright future," said Smith, who bounced back from his ban in remarkable fashion by scoring 774 runs in four Ashes Tests against England this year.</p>
      <p>"I think he'll learn from his mistake and move past it."</p>
      <p>Pooran admitted to "changing the condition of the ball" after video footage showed him scratching the surface with his thumbnail against Afghanistan in Lucknow last week.</p>
      <p>"I recognise that I made an extreme error in judgement and I fully accept the ICC penalty," he said.</p>
      <p>"I want to assure everyone that this is an isolated incident and it will not be repeated. I promise to learn from this and come back stronger and wiser."</p>
