      <p>STEVENSON RANCH, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A young girl died and another was critically injured after their mother crashed twice while driving with no clothes on Monday in Stevenson Ranch.<br/><br/>The CHP says the woman driving the car was naked when she got into two separate collisions.<br/><br/>The woman's two daughters, ages 6 and 2, were in the back seat. Good Samaritans removed them from the wreckage just before it caught on fire, officials said.<br/><br/>"She was in the middle console area with no seat belt," said Bryan Timmerman, one of several good Samaritans who responded to the scene. "She was completely nude, no clothes."<br/><br/>An off-duty nurse performed CPR on the 6-year-old girl.<br/><br/>"She wasn't responsive, she was barely breathing," said Jelene Golbolakh. "She was foaming at the mouth and turning blue."<br/><br/>Good Samaritan Walter Gomez tried to console the 2-year-old.<br/><br/>"I held her hand and I just rubbed her head," Gomez said. "I was praying inside making sure she was OK."<br/><br/>The first crash happened in the area of The Old Road south of Pico Canyon Road just before 9:45 a.m.<br/><br/>Investigators say the woman continued driving after the first accident, then ran a red light and struck a power pole at the intersection of The Old Road and Pico Canyon. Witnesses say she was driving fast and did not appear to make any attempt to slow down.<br/><br/>The 6-year-old girl later died. The 2-year-old was initially listed in critical condition and later was said to be stable.<br/><br/>"I have kids," Timmerman said. "It was rough. Because we lost the 6 year old."<br/><br/>The woman is in stable condition.<br/><br/>It is not clear yet why the woman wasn't wearing clothes. Investigators are looking into whether alcohol was a factor in the crashes.</p>
