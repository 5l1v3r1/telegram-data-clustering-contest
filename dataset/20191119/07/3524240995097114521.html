      <p>The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr Sunday Dare, has said the crisis rocking Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso is unfortunate but surmountable.</p>
      <p>Dare made the disclosure during a courtesy call on the Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Prof. Michael Ologunde, on Saturday in Ogbomoso.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i>, the institution co-owned by Oyo and Osun States had been battling with a crisis over the ownership.</p>
      <p>Dare said the problems bedeviling the institution were surmountable, assuring them that the university would rise again.</p>
      <p>The minister described the recent meeting of Gov. Seyi Makinde and his Osun State counterpart, Gboyega Oyetola in Abuja as apt.</p>
      <p>He said that LAUTECH had consolidated on its leadership position as a University of Technology.</p>
      <p>Dare called on stakeholders to collectively work towards returning the institution to the period of uninterrupted academic activities.</p>
      <p>The minister promised to play active role in finding lasting solution to the incessant closure of the university, which he described as a model.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Ologunde lauded President Muhammadu Buhari on the appointment of Dare as a Minister, saying his choice was an indication that government truly believed in the youths.</p>
      <p>Ologunde admonished the minister to use his good office to help humanity and assist educational institutions as moulders of the nation’s future leaders to achieve their mandates.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the minister later delivered the 13th annual lecture of the LAUTECH Alumni Association.</p>
