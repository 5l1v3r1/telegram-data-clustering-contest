      <h1>'Could do better': End-of-year reports don't make the grade</h1>

      <p>Families are braced for end-of-year reports but Australia's leading testing authority says teachers should be grading students continuously throughout the year.</p>
      <p>The Australian Council for Educational Research says teachers should be saved from preparing avalanches of reports at the end of each semester.</p>
      <p>Traditional report cards place undue emphasis on student achievement and neglect personal development, according to a report by the council based on three years of data.</p>
      <p>Continuous assessment, the council argues, provides students and their families with real-time updates on progress.</p>
      <p>Schools can adapt traditional reporting online, using portals that students, parents and teachers can access.</p>
      <p>St Helena Secondary College in Melbourne's north-east introduced "progress tasks" – small, specific and frequent assessments – last year leading to an end of semester "assessment task".</p>
      <p>Associate principal Daniel Stephens said teachers also began updating parents on their child's progress by uploading bi-weekly "traffic light ratings" of red, amber or green to an online portal.</p>

      <p>"We can then ascertain: what are the appropriate intreventions a child needs? We're acting on the data. It’s one thing to assess, then it's how do you intervene," Mr Stephens said.</p>
      <p>He said St Helena's traffic light ratings and more consistent feedback was "formalising what teachers are doing anyway" and prevented an end of semester "bottleneck".</p>
      <p>"We just find exhaustive feedback at the end of semester isn’t as effective as during the cycle of learning that you’re in ... the world is so fast-paced it seems a bit archaic to say, 'here’s the end of semseter, here’s your report'. The world has changed and we’re trying to evolve too."</p>

      <p>Nearly 40 per cent of 159 teachers surveyed by the council said they did not think end-of-semester reports were useful to students. More than 80 per cent said they believed continuous reporting would be useful for parents and students.</p>
      <p>Dr Hilary Hollingsworth, one of three researchers involved in the study, said more consistent reporting could monitor when high-achieving students are "coasting" and help lower-achieving students better understand their progress.</p>
      <p>"We’re not saying necessarily throw the semester report out, or you must do online continuous reporting ... we think current reporting practices are simply inherited from days gone by," she said.</p>
      <p>"So now is the time to stop and have a really strong conversation to work out what is the purpose of all the things we do - online reporting, written reporting, portfolios and parent-teacher interviews."</p>
