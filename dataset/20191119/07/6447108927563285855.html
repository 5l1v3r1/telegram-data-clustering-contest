      <p>Respawn Entertainment has been working on a patch for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order which addresses some of the technical issues that the game has been facing. These include the slow loading times, texture flickering during certain missions, settings not saving correctly, and input issues for players using the keyboard. The patch should be or will soon be available on PC, and it will be released on PS4 and Xbox One at some point this week.</p>
      <p>The full list of fixes are as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>   •  <br/>We’ve fixed a texture flickering issue that would display on the screen while driving the AT-AT on Kashyyyk<br/>   •  <br/>Sometimes the input from the arrow keys would fail to respond within menus, this has now been fixed.<br/>   •  <br/>Dynamic resolution settings will now save properly.<br/>   •  <br/>Fixed an issued where the game could become slow and loading times longer than expected.</blockquote>
      <p>In our review for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Jim summarised the game by saying:</p>
      <p>“Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is exactly the kind of single player game we had originally hoped to see when EA and Disney joined forces. Even if you strip away the license, you’re left with a super satisfying mix or combat, story, and exploration, deftly crafted by a studio best known for spearheading an entirely different genre.”</p>
