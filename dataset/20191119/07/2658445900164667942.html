      <p>“This victory is not for the party or its members alone, but for the entirety of Nigerians.</p>
      <p>“May I call on the two governors-elect to be magnanimous in victory. The APC stands for the good of Nigerians, and I know the two governors-elect are part of the journey to make Nigeria better,” the Speaker said.</p>
