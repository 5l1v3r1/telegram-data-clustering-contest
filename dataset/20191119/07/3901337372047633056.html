      <p>Mahlonoko was promoted to Pirates’ first team last year as a 16-year-old. However, the attacking midfielder struggled for game-time under the club’s former coach Milutin Sredojevic as he made only three substitute appearances for the entire season.</p>

      <p>Thabiso Monyane, who has been making a name for himself with Bucs in the Absa Premiership this season, previously also played for Pele Pele. </p>
      <p>The defender was promoted to the first team at the start of the current season, while former Pirates striker Lyle Foster, who earned a big move to French club Monaco in January, previously also played for Pele Pele.    </p>
