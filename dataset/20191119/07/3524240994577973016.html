      <p>The Chief Medical Director of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Prof. Chris Bode, has implored Nigerians to stop travelling abroad to treat health-related challenges, saying the hospital is equipped to world standard.</p>
      <p>Bode spoke during the visit of the Rotary Club in Ogun and Lagos states to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The club also donated a playing court to the children ward in the hospital during the visit.</p>
      <p>The CMD said the hospital was recognised for excellent  medical services.</p>
      <p>He said, “LUTH that was known for strike before is stabilised with committed and dedicated staff. Currently, we are proud of equipment which can compete with other hospitals locally and abroad. That is why we are telling Nigerians not to go abroad for their health challenges again. For instance, we have a cancer centre that is well equipped, where more than 100 patients are treated daily.”</p>
      <p>The District Governor, Rotary International District 9110, Dr Jide Akeredolu, said the club was ready to render humanitarian services to Nigerians through the hospital.</p>
      <p>Akeredolu added that the donation of the playing court by the Ikate Rotary Club was to encourage children who were recovering from illness in the hospital.</p>
