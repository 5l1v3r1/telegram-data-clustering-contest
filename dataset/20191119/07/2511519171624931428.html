      <p>Poor mental health and high suicide rates among men is a key focus of the awareness day. Despite male suicide having dropped to its lowest rate in 30 years in the UK, it remains the biggest killer of men under the age of 45, <a href="https://www.thecalmzone.net/help/get-help/suicide/">according to charity CALM</a> (Campaign Against Living Miserably). </p>
      <p>International Men’s Day aims to highlight the problem of toxic masculinity and other cultural barriers which may prevent men from seeking help for their mental health when they feel they need it.</p>
      <p>The 2019 theme for International Men’s Day is “making a difference for men and boys”, which organisers say encourages men to be positive male role models for each other.</p>
