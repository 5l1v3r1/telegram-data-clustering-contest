      <p>Billy Lee (Thug) Grosclose, 45 of Novinger died unexpectedly on Friday November 15, 2019.</p>
      <p>He was born on September 10, 1974 in Unionville, MO. the son of Robert Lee and Edith May (Casady) Ruggles.</p>
      <p>Billy is survived by his three daughters, Caitlym and Casady of Arkansas and Sophia Grosclose of North Carolina; mother Edith May Ruggles and Steve Bishop of Novinger, MO.; father, Robert Grosclose of Lancaster, MO.; step-father, Jerry Ruggles; sisters, Tori Grosclose of Lancaster, MO., Crystal and husband Clayton of Queen City, Mo., Karen and husband Tony of Unionville, MO.; one brother, James Grosclose of Texas; three step brothers, Kevin Baird and wife Kelly of Novinger, MO., Jeff Baird, Michael Baird both of Novinger, MO.; nephews, Austin and Kasyn long with several other nieces nephews, cousins and friends.</p>
      <p>Full of energy with an outgoing personality, Billy was always the life of the party and could light up any room just by entering it. His passion for life, goofy and silly nature were contagious. Billy loved nature, hunting, fishing and about anything outdoors. He was a hard worker, loved to build things and enjoyed his years working in the logging and construction industries. Most of all he loved his daughters and family.</p>
      <p>A visitation with the family is planned for Thursday November 21, 2019 from 5:00pm to 7:00pm at the Schuyler County Church of Faith at US HWY 136 Lancaster, MO. A Service with pastor Sonny Smyser officiating follow at 7:00pm.</p>
