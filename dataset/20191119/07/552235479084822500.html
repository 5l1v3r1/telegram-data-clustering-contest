      <p>A Blantyre woman stabbed her abusive partner then phoned the police and confessed what she’d done.</p>
      <p>Lorraine Hatcher, 52, of Alpine Path, attacked Steven Roberts after a drinking session that went on into the early morning.</p>
      <p>Hatcher appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Friday and admitted stabbing her partner twice on the leg to his severe injury at her home on April 6.</p>
      <p>Scott King, prosecuting, said the couple had been in an on-off relationship for two or three years.</p>
      <p>There was a background of domestic abuse and Roberts had been convicted of offences against Hatcher.</p>
      <p>Mr King told the court: “On April 5 the couple were drinking together. This went on until 7.30 the following morning and both were under the influence.</p>
      <p>“There was then a heated argument and the accused took possession of a kitchen knife and stabbed Roberts twice on the left thigh.</p>
      <p>“This caused cuts which were about an inch wide.</p>
      <p>“The accused then dialled 101 and told police she stabbed ‘Stevie’ because he had tried to attack her.</p>
      <p>“Officers arrived and found Hatcher agitated and upset. She told them repeatedly that she had stabbed her partner.</p>
      <p>“Roberts was taken to Hairmyres Hospital where three staples were put in each wound.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Thomas Millar called for background reports and deferred sentence until December 16.</p>
      <p>Hatcher had her bail continued.</p>
