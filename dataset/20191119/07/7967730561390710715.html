      <h1>Ad campaign targets crossbench senators over union-busting bill</h1>

      <p>The Electrical Trades Union is ramping up its campaign against the Morrison government's Ensuring Integrity Bill, with a fresh print and social media advertising blitz targeting key crossbench senators - and a promise to continue until the next election.</p>

      <p>In the new advert, to run in major metropolitan and regional newspapers from Friday, the ETU appeals to workers to contact Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie and Centre Alliance senators Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff to "respectfully urge them to leave us alone" by voting against the bill.</p>
      <p>A resolution passed unanimously by the ETU in Hobart on Tuesday includes a commitment to continue the campaign "until the next election", including campaigning "against anyone who supported the bill - including affiliated representatives in the House of Representatives".</p>
      <p>Attorney-General Christian Porter, who had hoped to pass the union-busting legislation last week, must convince either Senator Lambie or One Nation leader Pauline Hanson to support the amended bill, drafted <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53a9m.html">in negotiation with Senator Patrick</a>, if he is to get it through the upper house.</p>
      <p>The advert states that the Morrison Government "wants to make it harder for working Australians to seek fair pay and safe workplaces" yet allowed "big business and the banks" to get away with criminal banking breaches, workplace deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen wages.</p>
      <p>The newspaper adverts will be accompanied by a social media campaign targeting the crossbench senators' constituencies.</p>
      <p>Senator Patrick responded to an earlier ETU advertisement targeting him and Senator Lambie by cutting off talks with the Australian Council of Trade Unions over the bill, refusing to see ACTU secretary Sally McManus in Canberra last week.</p>
      <p>"It's a shame this approach has been adopted because the ads have not, and will not sway us in any way," he told the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The closing down of dialogue is harmful to their own cause."</p>
      <p>Senator Lambie, who is yet to decide whether she will vote for the bill - despite threatening to do so if CFMMEU Victorian secretary John Setka did not resign - said the ETU campaign was "hurting their own reputation and that of the ETU members' integrity".</p>
      <p>ETU president Troy Gray said members "make no apology for making their displeasure known to Rex Patrick, Stirling Griff, Jackie Lambie and other crossbench senators".</p>

      <p>"It is our democratic right to stick up for workers and their families against the draconian laws," he said.</p>
      <p>ETU secretary Allen Hicks said the Ensuring Integrity Bill, which would make it easier to deregister law breaking unions and disqualify officials, was "an abomination" that "seeks to punish workers and their representatives for campaigning for safer workplaces and better conditions".</p>
      <p>Unions argue the bill, even with amendments, will enable the Registered Organisations Commission to shut down unions and disqualify union leaders based on minor breaches of workplace laws, such as submitting late paperwork.</p>
      <p>Mr Porter disputes this, but has refused to make the amendments public, despite calls from Labor's industrial relations spokesman Tony Burke.</p>
      <p>Senator Patrick said he had negotiated "a dramatically different bill" that would "not affect the good unions".</p>
      <p>Senator Hanson, who last week said she would not "rush" the bill through, will release a statement on Wednesday.</p>
