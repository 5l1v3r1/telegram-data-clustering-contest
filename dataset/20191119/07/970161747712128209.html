      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eden-hazard/">Eden Hazard</a> believes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>’s young side are capable of pulling off an upset when they take on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> champions Manchester City on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The west Londoners’ first game back after the international break is a very testing trip to the Etihad Stadium, where they lost 6-0 on their last visit back in February under Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>But Frank Lampard’s young side are flying at the moment and currently sit a place and a point higher than City in the table.</p>

      <p>Hazard has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/eden-hazard-frank-lampard-chelsea-youngsters-11170911/">spoken highly of Lampard’s impact</a> at Stamford Bridge already and he believes Chelsea’s young, fearless side can go to the Etihad with genuine hopes of getting the win.</p>
      <p>Asked if Chelsea can beat City, Hazard told <i>Sky Sports</i>: ‘Of course I think so. It’s not going to be easy. It’s hard to play there.</p>

      <p>‘Last time we played them we lost 6-0, so bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well.</p>
      <p>‘But I think this season they are really good. They are really young, but they are really good, so why not go there and win the game?</p>
      <p>‘When I watch them, no Hazard but it’s a party! They can score, they score a lot of goals, the fans are happy, they are third in the league, so it’s going to be a great season. They just need to stay there, win games and that’s it.’</p>
      <p>Hazard is currently on international duty with Belgium, who take on Cyprus in their final group game on Tuesday having already qualified for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>England also booked their place in the tournament and will be seeded in Pot 1 for the draw after scoring 38 goals in qualifying, and Hazard believes the Three Lions will be one of the main contenders next summer.</p>

      <p>Asked if he sees England as one of the favourites, Hazard continued: ‘Yeah definitely. I think they are quite similar to Belgium, they have experienced guys with young players – especially Chelsea players!</p>
      <p>‘But I think they are very good, so top players, they can score every time, in defence they are good, in midfield they are good. So I hope for Belgium if we play them in the Euros we can beat them, but it’s not going to be easy.’</p>
