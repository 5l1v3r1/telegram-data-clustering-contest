      <p>Scarlett Moffatt has been axed as a co-host from Ant &amp; Dec’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saturday-night-takeaway/">Saturday Night Takeaway</a> after three years.</p>

      <p>‘Scarlett Moffatt won’t feature as a contributor in the 2020 series of Saturday Night Takeaway,’ an ITV spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>‘We thank Scarlett for all of her hard work on the show and will announce details of the new series nearer transmission.’</p>
      <p>According to an insider, Scarlett won’t be replaced on the ITV show, which is presented by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.</p>
      <p>‘Show bosses are planning lots of new and exciting features for the 2020 series alongside the return of viewer favourites,’ a source told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/scarlett-moffatt-dropped-dream-job-20910092">Mirror</a>.</p>

      <p>They added: ‘Scarlett did a great job on the series and we thank her for all her hard work but sadly the new series doesn’t have room for her on-screen role.’</p>
      <p>The television personality had described bagging Saturday Night Takeaway as ‘an absolute dream’ back when her role was confirmed.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve watched Saturday Night Takeaway with my family for as long as I can remember I’m such a huge fan, so to be part of one of the biggest entertainment shows out there, with two of my all time TV heroes Ant and Dec, is an absolute dream,’ she said.</p>

      <p>The I’m A Celebrity sister show is now fronted by last year’s campmate Emily Atack, former Emmerdale star Adam Thomas and returning star Joel Dommett.</p>
