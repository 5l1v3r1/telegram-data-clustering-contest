      <p>Over the past few weeks, I've ended up using my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-nintendo-switch-lite-567684.phtml">Switch Lite</a> quite a bit.</p>
      <p>Whether it's loading it up with indies that I don't have on my regular Switch or a few AAA games and transferring saves between them, I really adore the portability and lightweight design of the Lite (it's also my in-bed "just a few matches before sleep" <i>Overwatch</i> machine). Nintendo is making that design a bit more multifaceted soon, provided you have the cash for the add-on component.</p>
      <p>Yep, it's an official Switch Lite flip cover, which is going on sale on December 8 alongside of a screen protector. According to the publisher it's being sold "exclusively online" <a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-lite-flip-cover.html">on Nintendo's website</a> and "select retail websites," and will run you $39.99. Don't expect it to be a Christmas gift: it goes on sale in December, but actually arrives in "early 2020."</p>
      <p>Like most Nintendo hardware that has a super-limited purchasing arrangement, it'll likely be a collector's relic sometime in 2021. If I do end up getting one, after my time with the Switch Lite is done years from now it'll go next to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../you-can-pre-order-the-old-3ds-nfc-amiibo-reader-right-now-295592.phtml">the Nintendo 3DS NFC Reader/Writer Accessory</a>.</p>
