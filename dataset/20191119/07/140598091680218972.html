      <h1>New Zealand prepare to face Jofra Archer promising to 'fight fire with fire'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:06:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/scyld-berry/" target="_blank">Scyld Berry</a></address>
      <p>New Zealand plan on "fighting fire with fire" as they prepare to face Jofra Archer in his first overseas Test series.</p>
      <p>Archer's brutal assault on Australia's batting line-up - <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/09/07/ashes-agony-jofra-archer-against-old-foe-steve-smith-still-englands/">and Steve Smith, in particular </a>- during the Ashes did not go unnoticed in New Zealand, who are expecting similar treatment in the two-Test series which starts here on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>But the hosts have their own pace options to unleash, not least Lockie Ferguson, who has proven capable of matching Archer's 90mph-plus spells in his one-day career and looks likely to earn a Test debut during this series. </p>
      <p>"Every time Archer's bowled, he's bowled with heat so I don't think that's a big surprise to anyone," said New Zealand coach Gary Stead. "He's a world-class player and he started in the Ashes with a real hiss and a roar. For us it's about getting used to that extra pace and then combating it and working out a way you can continue to score.</p>
      <p>"And we've someone in our squad who bowls at a similar type of speed in Lockie Ferguson. It's really exciting to be able to fight fire with fire in some ways. And it's exciting that there's a potential debut for him at some stage as well."</p>
      <p>Dominic Sibley - who will become England’s 694th Test cap when he makes his debut<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/11/18/refreshed-england-side-sam-curran-hoping-bowl-new-zealand-opening2/"> in the opening Test</a> - admitted that having Archer gives England a potent weapon to unleash.</p>
      <p>"Having someone who's quick, it sort of scares people at certain times," Sibley said. "Having that pace, it gives batsmen something different to think about. It's massive to have for us in the middle overs, for sure." <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/11/12/meet-dominic-sibley-englands-new-opening-test-batsman-old-fashioned/">Sibley, like England's previous specialist batting Test debutant Jason Roy, went to Whitgift school</a>. So did Sibley’s Test opening partner Rory Burns, although Burns also left it deliberately, aged 16, for better cricket opportunities. Not even Eton or Harrow in the 1880s could have matched Whitgift if England’s top three had all attended there.</p>
      <p>At a ground which is also making its Test debut, New Zealand’s ninth, Sibley as an opening batsman will have to contend with Trent Boult maximising local conditions, less than three weeks after Boult represented Northern Districts in a first-class match here. Boult took one wicket for 118 in Central Districts’ first innings but clicked with four in the second.</p>

      <p>The pitch will no doubt be less green by the start, as NZ Cricket need four or five days of ticket revenue, but the strong wind is going to make life difficult - especially when Boult, New Zealand’s quick left-armer, is harnessing the strong wind off the Bay of Plenty to bring the ball back into right-handed batsmen, like Sibley. It will be Sibley’s strength and weakness that he has a relatively open stance. If he gets bat on ball, he can pick up legside runs off Boult. If he misses, and is hit on the pads, he will be relying on his partner to judge whether it is right to use one of England’s reviews.</p>
      <p>At least Sibley will have his former county captain, Burns, to walk out with. Burns used to drive Sibley to games and was playing when Sibley made his first and second XI debuts for Surrey. If he can detect that Boult’s inswinger will be heading down legside, it will on[y cement the friendship.</p>
      <p>“If I do play I'll try to do exactly the same as what I've done this season in county cricket,” Sibley said. “I'll try to get through the new ball, soak up as many balls as I can and score big hundreds. Hopefully I can add value to the team as well.”</p>
