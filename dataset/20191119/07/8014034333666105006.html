      <p>JOHANNESBURG — Mali’s military says 24 soldiers are dead in the latest extremist attack as alarm grows about the vast Sahel region as a haven for fighters linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaida.</p>
      <p>Monday’s attack comes amid a surge in assaults that have killed over 100 Malian troops in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>A statement overnight says 29 soldiers were wounded and 17 extremists killed at Tabankort in the northeastern Gao region.</p>
      <p>The attack occurred while soldiers from Mali and Niger carried out an operation along their border to track extremists. The statement says Nigerian troops detained about 100 suspects.</p>
      <p>Mali’s statement does not say which extremist group was to blame.</p>
      <p>Regional forces, French troops and a United Nations peacekeeping mission all are trying to contain the extremist threat.</p>
