      <p>The committee of Pothu Dikshithars, the hereditary custodians-cum-archakas of the Sri Natarajar Temple in Chidambaram has suspended Dharshan dikshithar and barred him from performing pooja in the temple for two months for assaulting a woman devotee on Saturday. A resolution to this effect was passed at a meeting of the Pothu Dikshithars, which convened in the temple on Tuesday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The committee, headed by secretary Balaganesh Dikshithar and deputy secretary Navamani Dikshithar, passed a resolution in this regard. The committee also imposed a fine of Rs.5,000.</p>
      <p>The action followed after the incident evoked widespread protests from various quarters. The complainant, S. Latha, working as a nurse in a Primary Health Centre in Ayyankudi, near Chidambaram alleged that the dikshitar slapped her when she questioned him for performing pooja even before she could tell him her son’s details, on his birthday.</p>
