      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> don’t want to lose the 32-year-old utility man and are looking for him to commit his future to Parkhead.</p>
      <p>But the clock is ticking for the Hoops as Hayes’ representatives will be free to open talks with other clubs in the New Year.</p>
      <p>There’s also the prospect that Celtic could lose Hayes for nothing in the summer if he were to agree a pre-contract switch.</p>
      <p>New Stoke manager Michael O’Neill is keen to tempt Hayes, who started his career at Reading before joining Leicester in 2007, back down south.</p>
      <p>He also had loan spells at Northampton and then Cheltenham Town before he headed north to sign for Inverness Caley Thistle in 2009 and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Aberdeen</a> in 2012.</p>
      <p>After five years at Pittodrie, where has was a League Cup winner in 2014, he was signed for Celtic by Brendan Rodgers.</p>
      <p>Hayes has made 16 appearances for Celts this season and scored in September’s 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> at Ibrox.</p>
