      <h1>Government expected to sign National Broadband Plan contract today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/newstalk" target="_blank">Newstalk</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>It's expected the contract for the €3 billion National Broadband Plan contract will be signed today.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The deal is set to get approval from the Cabinet after the EU <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/index.php/news/green-light-national-broadband-plan-925527">last week ruled</a></b> the proposal complies with state aid rules.</p>
      <p>The European Commission was investigating whether the Government spend on the plan breached EU state aid rules, which restrict national investment in services offered by private ventures</p>
      <p>Cabinet ministers are meeting at the earlier time of 7:30am this morning to sign off on the contract.</p>
      <p>It's likely the contracts will then be signed with National Broadband Ireland this morning on the back of the Cabinet approval.</p>
      <p>The project aims to roll out broadband to 540,000 homes, farms and businesses - providing high speed internet to around 1.1 million people.</p>
      <p>However, the project has not been without controversy.</p>
      <p>Delays and setbacks involved a number of firms pulling out of the bidding for the contract.</p>
      <p>A number of opposition parties have also demanded that the broadband network should be publicly owned, as the State is investing up to €3 billion in the process.</p>
      <p>That's likely to become a lot more difficult after the contracts are signed.</p>
      <p>The broadband plan is likely to form a big part of Fine Gael's pitch to voters in the upcoming general election.</p>
