      <h1>Microsoft will end support for Cortana on iOS and Android next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:28:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:28</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft on Friday announced that it will end support for the Cortana app on both iOS and Android as part of the virtual assistant’s “evolution”.</p>
      <p>“To make your personal digital assistant as helpful as possible, we’re integrating Cortana into your Microsoft 365 productivity apps,” the company added on its <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4531683">support blog</a>.</p>
      <p>Following the change, users will no longer have access to reminders and lists via Cortana. Instead, the information will only be accessible via Cortana on Windows.</p>
      <p>“Also, Cortana reminders, lists, and tasks are automatically synced to the Microsoft To-Do app, which you can download to your phone for free,” Microsoft continued.</p>
      <p>Support for Cortana for iOS and Android will end on 31 January 2020.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the company earlier this month also launched an <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/microsofts-new-office-app-combines-word-excel-and-powerpoint-on-mobile/">all-in-one Microsoft Office app</a> as well.</p>
