      <h1>Short story | A bird of another feather</h1>
      <h2>Sreemarthan looked down from the terrace, contemplating his holidays, when...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:55:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Shreekumar-Varma-2949/" target="_blank">Shreekumar Varma</a></address>
      <p>A holiday is like your favourite juice.</p>
      <p>You sip it, enjoying every sip. And then you get so greedy you gulp it down. Before you know it, nothing’s left in the glass. Sreemarthan’s holiday was over before it even began. Because his parents couldn’t keep up with him.</p>
      <p>They’d gone on a long drive, watched a movie, spent a day at the beach and eaten at a fancy restaurant. His parents had now returned to their computers. When Sreemarthan asked them to come out again, they pretended they didn’t hear. Finally, they stared at him with round, red eyes and said in one voice: “Again?!”</p>
      <p>Sreemarthan went up to the terrace. He rested his chin on the parapet and stared gloomily at the road below. So many people doing so many things! He was lost in his thoughts when he heard a sound. It sounded like a big fat chuckle. Startled, he looked around. There was no one on the terrace!</p>

      </p>
      <p>Then he spotted a huge jet-black crow perched on the rusted metal pipe above. They surveyed each other sombrely. The crow tilted its head. It nodded at Sreemarthan. It made him think of Grandpa when he used to visit them. He’d sit silently in the living room, making funny, jerky movements with his head.</p>
      <p>Sreemarthan laughed. “You look exactly like my grandfather,” he told the crow before going back to staring at the road.</p>
      <p>“He’s that handsome, eh?” It was the roughest voice he’d ever heard.</p>
      <p>He looked up at the crow in shock. “Don’t tell me you spoke!”</p>
      <p>The crow turned away irritably. ”Never heard a bird speak or what?”</p>
      <p>Sreemarthan stood frozen. His aunt had once said that people who died came back as crows. His grandfather had died last year. In a trembling voice, he asked, “Are you my grandfather?”</p>
      <p>The crow made a contemptuous, gargling sound.</p>
      <p>Sreemarthan’s eyes widened. “That’s how Grandpa gargled after brushing his teeth!”</p>
      <p>The crow shook its head as if it couldn’t believe its ears. “What’s this with your grandfather?” it said crossly. “Do I look that old? Do I look human?”</p>
      <p>“My grandfather died last year,” said Sreemarthan in a small voice.</p>
      <p>“Do I look like a dead human grandfather?” cackled the big black crow.</p>
      <p>“Then how can you speak? Birds don’t speak!”</p>
      <p>“You’re the craziest boy I ever met! A living bird can’t speak but a dead human grandfather can? There are birds and birds. I’m a bird of another feather.”</p>
      <p>Sreemarthan felt he was going crazy. “Wait here,” he told the crow and ran downstairs. His parents were still staring at their computers.</p>
      <p>“Come to the terrace, quick! There’s a crow there.” His mother looked at his father. His father looked at his mother. They went back to their computers. “It’s not an ordinary crow, it speaks!” They looked at him, exasperated. “It’s not just an ordinary speaking crow, it’s Grandpa!” he said.</p>
      <p>That got a reaction. “What!” they said in one voice.</p>
      <p>“Yes, <i>your</i> father,” he told his mother. “He laughs and gargles like Grandpa. He does this with his head.” Sreemarthan jerked his head like the crow.</p>
      <p>He ignored his mother’s look of outrage and pulled at her arm. “Come!” he pleaded. “Or he’ll fly away!”</p>
      <p>When he literally bullied his parents upstairs, the crow was still there. It looked sombrely down at them, making those Grandpa-like jerks with its head. His mother clutched Sreemarthan’s hand. “You’re crazy!” she yelled. And then she whispered, “Dad?”</p>
      <p>The crow shook its head in disbelief. It raised three feathers on its shoulder and scratched them with its huge beak. It gave them a final look of disgust, and said, “Caw, caw!”</p>
      <p>Sreemarthan’s father laughed heartily. “That’s your father?” he teased his wife. However much Sreemarthan tried, the crow spoke nothing but caw-words. His parents went down, he chuckling, and she angrily.</p>
      <p>Sreemarthan faced the crow. “You didn’t say a word!” he said accusingly.</p>
      <p>The crow sighed loudly. “First of all, I’m NOT your grandfather. And, secondly, I don’t speak with every Tom, Dick and Harry.”</p>
      <p>“So why did you speak with me?” asked Sreemarthan.</p>
      <p>“Because, you,” the crow explained patiently, “are like me — a bird of another feather.”</p>
