      <h2>Arsenal legend Martin Keown heaps praise on Liverpool FC duo Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez</h2>

      <h3>Martin Keown believes Liverpool FC duo Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez merit a regular place in the England starting XI.</h3>
      <p>The Liverpool FC centre-half started alongside Harry Maguire for England’s 4-0 win against Kosovo despite falling down the pecking order at Anfield this term.</p>
      <p>Gomez is behind Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in Jurgen Klopp’s squad after the England international returned from a serious injury earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold impressed at right-back in the England team as the 21-year-old continues his promising start to the season for both club and country.</p>
      <p>Although the Liverpool FC starlet didn’t score or make an assist in England’s 4-0 victory over Kosovo, Alexander-Arnold laid down a marker in the race to secure a starting spot at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal defender Keown believes Alexander-Arnold and Gomez warrant a starting spot in Southgate’s England team.</p>
      <p>“[Gareth] Southgate will have left Kosovo asking himself questions,” Keown wrote in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7695675/MARTIN-KEOWN-England-boss-Gareth-Southgate-looking-answers-defence.html">his Daily Mail column</a>.</p>
      <p>“Who starts at the back alongside Harry Maguire? I’d go with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>“Southgate likes to pick players who play regularly for their clubs.</p>
      <p>“Gomez has not been starting as much as he would like for Liverpool, but I’d break that rule for him.</p>
      <p>“The attack-minded Trent Alexander-Arnold does not always act as a right back, but that is because he is one of the best going forward.”</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold has scored one goal and has made three assists in 12 games in the Premier League so far this season.</p>
      <p>His only goal of the campaign came in a 2-1 win against Chelsea FC at Stamford Bridge back in September.</p>
      <p>Gomez has made one Premier League start and has come off the bench three times to rack up a mere 99 minutes of top-flight football this term.</p>
