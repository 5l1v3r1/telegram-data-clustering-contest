      <p>Dollar/yen has been on the back foot amid doubts that the US and China are able to strike a trade deal. Looking at the charts, the technical battle lines are well-drawn.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">Technical Confluences Indicator</a> is showing that USD/JPY is capped by a dense cluster of resistance at <b>108.75</b>, which includes the Bollinger Band one-day Middle, the Simple Moving Average 100-4h, the SMA 5-4h, the SMA 100-15m, the SMA 100-1h, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week, and more.</p>
      <p>Higher up, another substantial cap awaits at <b>109.36</b>, which is the convergence of the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 2, the PP 1w-R1, the previous monthly high, the previous weekly high, the BB 1d-Upper, and the PP 1m-R1.</p>
      <p>Support awaits at <b>108.24</b>, which is the confluence of the SMA 5-one-day, the PP 1w-S1, the PP 1d-S2, the Fibonacci 61.8% one-month, and the previous weekly low.</p>
      <p>Further down, weak support is at <b>107.72</b>, which is where the SMA 100-1d and the PP 1w-S2 converge. </p>
      <p>Here is how it looks on the tool:</p>

      <h3>Confluence Detector</h3>
      <p>The Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a <b>congestion of indicators,</b> moving averages, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci levels</a>, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.</p>
      <p>This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin">price level without any indicator</a> or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.</p>
