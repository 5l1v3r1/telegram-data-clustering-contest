        <b>Martin Fowler (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) was left devastated in EastEnders when — in order to protect her from the villainous Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) — he was forced to lie to wife Stacey (Lacey Turner), and thus he informed her that he’d cheated on her. However, Martin’s lies could end up resembling the truth in the coming episodes, as he shares something of a moment with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ruby-allen/">Ruby Allen</a> (Louisa Lytton). Could the pair be about to embark on a steamy affair?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s been a tough couple of months for Martin. He’s been at the beck and call of Ben, and has been made to take part in all sorts of dodgy activities to appease the young man.</p>
      <p>However, matters went from bad to worse when — after Martin had him arrested — Ben hung him from the railway bridge and threatened to do the same to Stacey if he saw her back on the Square.</p>

      <p>As a result, Martin lied to his wife, and claimed he’d slept with Sonia — hoping that such a claim would keep her away from Walford. His plan worked, and thus he’s remained in Ben’s service ever since.</p>

      <p>In the coming episodes, Martin continues to spiral out of control as he struggles to get along with Dotty (Milly Zero) — much to Bex’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jasmine-armfield/">Jasmine Armfield</a>) dismay. He later clashes with Sonia once more — who informs him she’s tired of his behaviour.</p>
      <p>Ruby overhears that Martin and Stacey’s marriage is over and she’s shocked to say the least. However, she’s caught up trying to help Ian (Adam Woodyatt) with his campaign, and manages to convince Martin into getting involved — but when Ian mentions Stacey, Martin’s not best pleased.</p>

      <p>Later in the week, matters get out of hand in The Vic, and Martin storms out — but Ruby follows him. Ruby offers him to stay at her flat, and he thanks her for all her support.</p>
      <p>However, he leans in for a kiss — but manages to stop himself.</p>
      <p>Will we see Ruby and Martin embark on an affair? If so, his marriage to Stacey may well and truly be over — especially given that Ruby’s Stacey’s best friend.</p>
