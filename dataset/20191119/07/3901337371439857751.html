      <p>Lionel Scaloni's rejuvenated Argentina side continued their fighting spirit against Uruguay, coming from behind twice to draw with Oscar Tabarez's men following a 1-0 win over Brazil last Friday.</p>
      <p>After Cavani put his country ahead in the first half, Argentina equalised through striker Sergio Aguero in the 63rd minute after Messi picked him out with a delightful free-kick into the box.</p>
      <p>Uruguay restored their lead with a superb free-kick from Luis Suarez just six minutes later, before Messi's penalty in the 90th minute made the score 2-2.</p>

      <p>During the game, though, there was more than one scuffle between Argentina and Uruguay players, with Paris Saint-Germain striker Cavani and FC Barcelona's Messi taking the spotlight late in the first half.</p>

      <p>The incident occurred after the Argentines were awarded a free-kick outside the Uruguay box, but was defused when players from both teams stepped in to separate the two forwards.</p>
