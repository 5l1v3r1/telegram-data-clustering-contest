      <p>SOUTH WHITTIER, Calif. (KABC) -- Residents in a South Whittier neighborhood are demanding something be done to slow down traffic in the area after a car slammed into a teenager crossing the street in a school zone.<br/><br/>The stretch of Cole Road near Lambert Road has a 30 mph speed limit and a school is located nearby, but neighbors have complained of cars flying through the area. On Monday, a teenager who was crossing the street to get to his parents' car was struck by a vehicle at around 3:20 p.m.<br/><br/>The incident was caught on doorbell camera video.<br/><br/>The vehicle that hit the teenager stopped and that teenager was taken to a local trauma center. Mary Torres has lived in the neighborhood for 30 years and says she's angry the city hasn't done more to encourage cars to slow down.<br/><br/>"It's ridiculous," she said. "Why do we have to wait to have somebody die or get critically injured to get something done."<br/><br/>The teenager who was hit flew 15 feet in the air and landed back on the ground. Neighbors say they don't remember an accident this bad happening on their street.<br/><br/>"They should have speed bumps or another stop sign in between this road because there's a lot of cars that speed through here like it's a freeway," said resident Vanessa Chatel.<br/><br/>The condition of the student was not known. The accident is under investigation.</p>
