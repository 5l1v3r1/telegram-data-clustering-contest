      <h1>World's most dangerous places to travel to in 2020</h1>
      <h2>Tourists are advised to stay away from several countries next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>The most dangerous places to travel to in the world have been revealed in a new map.</p>
      <p>The Travel Risk Map lists places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Sudan as having the highest travel security risk.</p>
      <p>Countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Niger along with North Korea, Venezuela and Haiti all score "very high" when it comes to health risk - including infectious diseases - <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/most-dangerous-places-travel-2020-17273829">reports the Manchester Evening News.</a></p>
      <p>The map, created by security and risk experts International SOS, ranks the safety of countries across the globe in terms of medical, security and road risks.</p>
      <p>For the first two categories, countries are given a rating out of five, while road safety is rated out of four based on the mortality rate per 100,000 people.</p>

      <p>Those visiting Europe, the USA, Japan, South Korea, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand all have the lowest chance of catching a disease while travelling.</p>
      <p>When it comes to security threat to travellers is negligible in places such as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Slovenia, Greenland and Finland.</p>
      <p>Travel security risk levels are considered low (rather than insignificant) in the UK and Ireland - on par with the rest of Europe, the US and Canada, China, Australia and New Zealand.</p>

      <p>Some of the world’s most dangerous roads are in Vietnam, Venezuela, Belize, Saudi Arabia, the Dominican Republic, South Africa and Thailand.</p>
      <p>However UK roads are considered safe by comparison, along with most of Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Japan being ranked as low risk.</p>
      <p>International SOS MD Doug Quarry said: "The threats facing organisations and their workforces are impacting established and emerging economies alike.</p>
      <p>"It’s encouraging to see that decision makers are becoming increasingly aware of the threats of epidemics and infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>"With accurate information, tools and support in place, organisations should, and can, plan for the anticipated risks and safeguard their investment and their people."</p>
