      <p>More than 2,000 Tamil Nadu fishermen were allegedly chased away by the Sri Lankan Navy while they were fishing near Katchatheevu islet, a fishermen association leader said here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The fishermen from this island town had ventured into the sea on Monday evening in 540 boats and were fishing off Katchatheevu when a team of Sri Lankan naval personnel came to the spot and attacked before driving them away, Rameswaram Fishermen Association President P. Sesuraja alleged.</p>
      <p>Fishing nets of 20 boats were also snapped, he said adding the fisherfolks were forced to return to the shore without a catch.</p>
      <p>He urged the Centre to take up the fishermenâ€™s issue with the newly-elected Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.</p>
      <p>Early this month, over 3,000 fishermen from here were allegedly chased away by Sri Lankan Navy when they were fishing near Katchatheevu islet.</p>
