      <p>Why am I not immune to nettle stings? I’m 70 years old and was stung in the garden the other day. As a child we played in the fields and woods all the time – I must have been stung at least 5,000 times. Also, while on the subject, when I was stung yesterday I couldn’t find a dock-leaf – my Dad used to say there were always docks near nettles. Where have they gone?</p>
