      <p>Mrunal Thakur has been confirmed as the female lead in Shahid Kapoor’s upcoming film ‘Jersey’, a remake of the Telugu hit of the same name.</p>
      <p>It is said that Thakur’s character will “anchor to Shahid’s, who goes on an emotional journey against all odds to play cricket for the country in his mid 30’s, when it’s time for most people to retire from competitive sports”.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Thakur said, “When I saw the original film, I was bowled over by its passionate emotional journey. It felt like I had lived a full lifetime of experiences in those two plus hours. So deep was the affect of the film on me that I couldn’t get it out of my heart the whole night, so I immediately watched it again the next day. I can’t wait for Hindi audiences to experience a similar impact.”</p>
      <p>Thakur was recently seen in ‘Batla House’ and ‘Super 30’.</p>
