      <p>Aaron Carter has been seen in public for the first time since being admitted to hospital last week, as he headed back to Los Angeles from Florida.</p>
      <p>The singer, 31, was seen still wearing his hospital wristband and appearing to have<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/aaron-carter-taken-hospital-dangerous-weight-loss-amid-family-drama-11147962/"> lost significant weight, which was why he had been admitted to the medical facility.</a></p>
      <p>Aaron had travelled back to his home in LA, and was seen wearing his own merch – a baseball cap with his name on the front – as he picked up some bits at a petrol station.</p>
      <p>As the photo of him in a hospital bed emerged, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/aaron-carter-kisses-mum-jane-on-lips-as-they-hit-swanky-red-carpet-after-tough-few-months-10899848/">Aaron’s mother revealed she would be looking after his social media channels</a> for him ‘until he recovers’, as well as being his new manager.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed the reason for his hospital visit was due to his ‘alarming weight loss’ caused by family stress, according to TMZ.</p>

      <p>The site reported that Aaron’s mum, Jane, took him in to see doctors because he weighed just 115lb (eight stones and two pounds) down from his previous weight of 160lb (11 stone four pounds).</p>
