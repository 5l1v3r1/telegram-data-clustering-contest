      <p>Jane McDonald has responded after she became the unlikely inspiration for Adele Roberts' luxury item on this year's I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night's episode, the famous faces in the main camp were tasked with retrieving the goods they selected prior to show over a pond - with nothing but oars to help them.</p>
      <p>As they tried to grab each parcel in turn the items each celebrity had picked to bring them comfort for the foreseeable future were revealed.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway chose concealer, James Haskell an orthopaedic pillow and Roman Kemp plumped for a mug with a picture of his family on it.</p>
      <p>Radio 1 DJ Adele plumped for something a little more bizarre.</p>

      <p>She told her fellow campmates that she'd selected a picture of Loose Women star and cruise ship legend Jane McDonald to bring her support during her stint Down Under.</p>
      <p>Adele said she was huge fan of Jane's work and after the photo was successfully obtained encouraged her pals to 'give Jane a rub for luck.'</p>
      <p>Jane has now responded after her surprise cameo in the jungle.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Jane wrote: "Absolutely thrilled to see my picture in the jungle. Adele Roberts I flipping love you," followed by a red love heart.</p>
      <p>She then revealed that she'd be supporting her fellow Notherner in the jungle, "Best of luck," added Jane.</p>
      <p>Adele's pick had come as a surprise to her campmates and viewers at home with celebs usually opting for something practical to make their time in the jungle that little bit easier.</p>

      <p>The broadcaster was one of only two celebs to receive their goodies from home - with Kate Garraway also getting her hands on her make-up - after the team failed miserably at their attempts to save the luxury items before they sank.</p>
      <p>The celebs in the spin off camp, who have been living on basic rations, were particularly upset to see hear of the watery demise of their home comforts.</p>
