      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The Regulatory Commission of Alaska is considering changes to rules governing the state’s trash companies.</p>
      <p>The Anchorage Daily News reported Monday that the commission has opened a public comment period on questions related to garbage collection, with comments due by Dec. 5.</p>
      <p>The request for input follows a 2018 complaint filed against Alaska Waste by competing trash service BlueArctic.</p>
      <p>The complaint says Alaska Waste unfairly lowered rates for prospective BlueArctic customers while leaving rates untouched for others.</p>
      <p>Regulators found the complaint groundless. The general manager of BlueArctic declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Some Alaska trash companies say deregulation could make it easier for new companies to open, creating competition that could drive down garbage rates.</p>
      <p>Others say deregulation could increase the risk of predatory action by larger companies, reducing competition.</p>
