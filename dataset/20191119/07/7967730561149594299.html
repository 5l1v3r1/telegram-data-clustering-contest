      <h1>Olyroos quartet cop heavy bans for 'unprofessional conduct' in Cambodia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:12:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:12</time> by <a rel="author">Vince Rugari</a></address>
      <p>Four Australian under-23 players have been suspended from international duty and three of them have had their Olympic dreams dashed as punishment for "unprofessional conduct" alleged by a woman in Cambodia this year.</p>
      <p>Adelaide United star and Olyroos captain Riley McGree, Melbourne City pair Nathaniel Atkinson and Lachie Wales, and Perth Glory midfielder Brandon Wilson have been heavily sanctioned by the Football Federation Australia board after a seven-month investigation.</p>

      <p>McGree has been stood down from international football until April 1, while Atkinson, Wales and Wilson won't be eligible to represent Australia until August 10 - effectively banning them from Tokyo 2020 if the Olyroos qualify.</p>
      <p>It's still unclear what the quartet did to attract such punishment, or why McGree was handled more leniently, but the allegations relate to the final night of the team's stay in Phnom Penh, where they had just wrapped up the AFC Under-23 Championship qualifying tournament in March.</p>

      <p>In a statement, FFA said it was made aware of the incident in April after a complaint by a woman, who is believed to have lodged it with Sport Australia (formerly the Australian Sports Commission) rather than directly to the federation.</p>
      <p>Sources with knowledge of what occurred were tight-lipped about the details out of concern for the welfare of the players, at least one of whom has struggled with mental health issues since the incident. But it is believed the four players broke a curfew and one of them made contact with a woman via Tinder.</p>
      <p>The "complexity" of the investigation, as described by FFA's statement, was partly due to difficulties in contacting the woman concerned and some inconsistencies in the allegations, sources have suggested.</p>
      <p>"These sanctions are commensurate to the nature of the breaches of the National Code of Conduct which is in place to safeguard both the players and the reputation of Australian football," FFA chairman Chris Nikou said.</p>
      <p>"Upholding our commitment to respect and responsibility cannot be compromised. Our game is built on equality, inclusivity and respect and these are values that we will continue to uphold.</p>
      <p>"The players have understood the gravity of their actions and have positively commenced respectful relationship programs that will ensure they appreciate these values in the future."</p>

      <p>The PFA said in a statement: "The PFA has, and continues to, represent the players throughout this process and will work closely with each of them on their options, including appealing the sanctions imposed. From the outset the players have accepted responsibility, undertaken respectful relationships counselling and, at all times, acted co-operatively with the FFA during the investigation."</p>
      <p>The four players, who will be directed by FFA to participate in educational courses and counselling as part of their punishments, are able to appeal to the independent FFA Disciplinary and Ethics Committee if they wish.</p>
      <p>As for the Olyroos, losing McGree in particular looms as a massive setback for January's Asian qualifiers in Thailand, where the top three teams will qualify for Tokyo 2020. Australia have not appeared in the men's tournament at an Olympics since Beijing 2008.</p>
