      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Dec Donnelly drops huge hint about final leaving fans in panic</h1>
      <h2>The I'm A Celebrity 2019 final date has not yet been announced, but host Dec Donnelly teased when the latest series will end</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:39:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity fans were a little panicked when Dec Donnelly hinted at the 2019 final date, when the latest series will end.</p>
      <p>Dec and co-host Ant McPartlin dropped news about how long the series was on for on ITV, with it launching last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Almost all the stars have entered the jungle including Caitlyn Jenner, Jacqueline Jossa, Ian Wright, Roman Kemp and Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>There's two new arrivals set to enter the camp, with reports that Coronation Street's Andy Whyment and former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi are the mystery stars.</p>
      <p>Now, Dec has let slip to fans how long they can expect to see their jungle favourites on screen.</p>

      <p>While there's plenty of time left on the show, fans already don't want it to end with many tipping it to "fly by".</p>
      <p>Dec said to pal Ant that there was still 20 days to go on the show.</p>
      <p>With Australia between 8-10 hours ahead of UK time, It's not clear whether they meant 20 days from Monday or Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Either way this is the usual amount of time for the ITV jungle series, which last year ended on Sunday 9 December.</p>
      <p>This time around, judging by Dec's confession, it's likely to finish on Sunday 8th December.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , viewers confessed they weren't quite ready for it to finish even with weeks until then.</p>

      <p>One fan said: "20 days to go, it’ll fly by," alongside a crying face emoji.</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "Dec saying 20 days left think I just nearly threw up."</p>
      <p>A third added: "20 days left omg."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile others were fully aware that was a long amount of time, with one fan commenting: "It’s day 2 Dec..."</p>
      <p>
        <b>I'm A Celebrity continues at 9pm on ITV.</b>
