      <p>Lottery tickets prices are increased due to other expenses, according to lottery ticket sale agents.</p>
      <p>“We bought them from big lottery shops with the price of Ks1,097 per ticket. But we have to made packaging and we also cost rental fee and labour charges for shop,” said a sale agent of Moe Yan Shwe Lamin &amp; Myat Su Kaday lottery shop.</p>
      <p>The increase of ticket price was only started in November and the tickets were sold with Ks1,200 per ticket during October. If the tickets are not packaged, the price is only Ks1,000 per ticket, according to Moe Yan Shwe Lamin &amp; Myat Su Kaday lottery shop.</p>
      <p>Only the Moe Yan Shwe Lamin &amp; Myat Su Kaday lottery shop is selling with the above mentioned price and other lottery shops such as Aungbarlay, Shwe Myanmar and Yadanar Thein Htike Aung are selling with Ks1,100 per ticket, sources said.</p>
      <p>“We fixed the price and sold with Ks1,100 per ticket and we don’t know why Moe Yan Shwe Lamin &amp; Myat Su Kaday is increased the ticket price,” said a person from Aungbarlay lottery shop.</p>
      <p>One of the buyers said Ks1,250 per ticket is a little expansive and some vendors selling with push-carts are selling with Ks1,300 per ticket.</p>
