      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: Actress and TMC MP Nusrat Jahan was discharged from hospital on Monday evening, a day after she was admitted with complains of respiratory trouble, sources close to her said, dismissing reports of drug overdose as "rumours".</p>
      <p>Jahan was released after her health condition showed significant improvement, a senior official of the city-based private hospital where she was admitted, said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“She will be under medication and needs rest,” he said.</p>
      <p>The MP from Basirhat was rushed to hospital on Sunday night due to respiratory problems, a statement issued by her family said, adding, she has a history of asthma.</p>
      <p>Police sources, however, said that Jahan, after celebrating her husband Nikhil Jain’s birthday, had taken an overdose of medicine, following which her health condition deteriorated.</p>
      <p>“Nusrat Jahan was rushed to a hospital around 9.30 pm. She was admitted in the ICU and treatment started immediately,” they said.</p>
      <p>The actress had won this year’s Lok Sabha elections from Basirhat by a huge margin of over three lakh votes.</p>
      <p>She married her long-time beau and city-based enterpreneur Nikhil Jain in June.</p>
      <p>Jahan had come in the firing line of Muslim clergy after she was seen sporting ‘sindoor’ (vermilion) while taking oath in the Parliament as the new MP.</p>
      <p>The TMC MP had responded by saying she represented an inclusive India, which was beyond the barriers of caste, creed and religion.</p>
