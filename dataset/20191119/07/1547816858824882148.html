      <p>Hands down, Smriti Irani is the coolest Instagrammer in recent times! Why do we say so? Well, it’s the actor-turned-politician’s hilarious, at the same time self-trolling posts that always keep her followers entertained. Irani often shares some witty captions when it comes to her weight and her family. And with her most recent post, Smriti Irani went a notch higher and poked fun at the fact that she is a college dropout and, umm, this time, she didn’t spare Bill Gates either.

      <p>Taking to her Instagram account, the BJP politician shared a picture of her with the billionaire Bill Gates, who was on a trip to India recently. The picture sees Bill Gates and Smriti Irani engrossed in a conversation. Well, Smriti being Smriti, gave this picture a hilarious twist through her caption. She wrote how since the two of couldn’t complete their studies and are dropouts, they are wondering what to do in the future. “सोच रहे हैं पढ़ाई पूरी करी नहीं , आगे क्या करे” (We are thinking since we didn't complete our studies, what should we do in future?). LOL! While Smriti Irani is a college degree dropout, Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, is a dropout from Harvard.</p>

      <p>Soon after, Smriti Irani’s good friend and TV czarina Ekta Kapoor was quick to pour in her reaction on this picture by giving it a Kyuki (a popular show of hers that starred Smriti Irani in the lead role) reference. She gave it her caption by commenting, "Bosss ! Tulsi kyunki abh bhi yaaad hai......pls waaapsi Karein.” We wish the same, Ekta!</p>
