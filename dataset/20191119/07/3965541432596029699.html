      <h1>Sentencing for Seahawks' Kendricks postponed for 5th time</h1>

      <p>SEATTLE - Seahawks linebacker Mychal Kendricks, who was scheduled to be sentenced for his insider trading case Thursday, has had his sentencing postponed again, coach Pete Carroll confirmed to reporters Monday.</p>
      <p>ESPN reported earlier Monday that Kendricks' sentencing had been rescheduled to February of next year, marking the fifth time that the case has been pushed back from its original Jan. 25 date.</p>
      <p>While it’s not clear why Kendricks’ case has been pushed back multiple times, it’s not totally uncommon for federal proceedings. Court dates can be postponed at the request of the defendant, the U.S. attorney or even the court itself.</p>
      <p>The postponement means that Kendricks will be able to play out the season for the Seahawks without federal punishment looming. He signed a one-year, $4.5 million deal with no guaranteed money with Seattle in the offseason.</p>
      <p>"Really happy for him, that he has that peace of mind as he works through the rest of the season," Carroll said of the news. "I have no statement about any of it, what it means. But I know for him, it gives him the peace of mind for this football season and he can really stay focused and all that. He's done a marvelous job under the circumstances and I'm real happy for him."</p>
      <p>The Seahawks had initially signed Kendricks in September 2018, after the Cleveland Browns released him in the aftermath of the insider trading charges. Kendricks allegedly made around $1.2 million from illegal tips provided by investor Damilare Sonoiki in 2014, in exchange for perks like tickets to Eagles games. Kendricks played for Philadelphia from 2012 to 2017.</p>
      <p>Kendricks played just four games for the Seahawks in 2018 due to his eight-game suspension for a violation of the league’s personal conduct policy — stemming from the insider trading case — and a broken tibia suffered in Week 14, his first game back from the suspension.</p>
      <p>But he’s been available for every game this season, and has made a big impact on the Seahawks’ base-heavy defense. In 10 games (all starts), Kendricks has a team-leading six tackles for loss and is tied for the team lead with three sacks.</p>
      <p>Kendricks has 49 combined tackles, an interception, four pass breakups and a forced fumble so far in 2019.</p>
