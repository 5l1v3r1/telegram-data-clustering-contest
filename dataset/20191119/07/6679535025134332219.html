      <p>Sunday mornings at Elliot’s Beach have become happy hours for many Chennaiites once again.</p>
      <p>The Hindu Car-Free Sundays, in association with the Greater Corporation of Chennai, Chennai Traffic Police, Institute for Transportation and Development Policy and City Connect, have once again started their initiative from last Sunday, to ensure the busy road is transformed into a vibrant community gathering.</p>
      <p>This time too, residents came together to continue their fitness journeys in an environment that is not only free of vehicles but pollution too. ‘Car- Free Sundays’ saw a motley group of people descending upon the 800-mt. stretch to enjoy various activities including Zumba, yoga, frisbee, badminton, football, board games -- traditional and modern -- a reading zone, pottery, a puppet show, story-telling and even traditional and freestyle dance.</p>

      <p>Navaneeth. L. V, Chief Executive Officer, The Hindu Group said: “The Hindu Car-Free Sundays is an initiative we are proud of. We are also looking to expand in more areas within Chennai and in other cities. What began as a one-off outing has now gone on to become a weekly habit for many regulars. This could not have been possible without the support of our partners and the love from the people.”</p>
      <p>Suresh Balakrishna, Chief Revenue Officer, The Hindu Group, said: “Car-free interventions are a prime example of a comprehensive public health intervention. Car-Free Sundays encourage social well-being through reduced environmental pollution. This is indeed a place for community building, and people from all walks of life enjoy this motor-free zone.”</p>
      <p>The Hindu Car-Free Sundays takes place on all Sundays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.</p>
