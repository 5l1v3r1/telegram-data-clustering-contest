      <p>Justice A. Rajasheker Reddy of Telangana High Court on Tuesday agreed to hear the cases relating to municipal elections tomorrow.</p>
      <p>A division bench of the HC headed by Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan earlier had delivered a verdict giving green signal to elections to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), disposing of a couple of Public Interest Litigations (PIL) on the matter. However, the Bench then directed the State government to approach the single judge court, which had issued a stay order on elections in some municipalities.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao mentioned about the elections before Justice Rajasheker Reddy, requesting him to vacate the stay order. After hearing Mr. Raoâ€™s contentions, the judge consented to hear arguments on the stay order on elections in some municipalities on Wednesday.</p>
