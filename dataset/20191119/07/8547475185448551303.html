      <p>People are being told to expect "slower journey times with delays to bus and train services possible."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile "there is a chance of delays or cancellations to flights."</p>
      <p>The worst-affected areas include most of the Midlands, Home Counties and southeast of England. Temperatures in these regions will struggle to exceed 5C on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Public Health England issued a cold weather warning from 9 am on Monday until 12 pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Dr Emer OConnell, a consultant at PHE, advised people to look out for anyone who may need help staying warm.</p>
      <p>She said: "Older people and those with heart and lung problems are at risk of getting sick in cold weather. Keep an eye out for those who may need help staying warm. Ensure they wear lots of thin layers and have everything they need."</p>
