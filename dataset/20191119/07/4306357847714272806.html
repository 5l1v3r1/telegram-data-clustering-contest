      <h1>Pundit tells Chelsea FC to forget about title challenge</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool FC legend Jason McAteer doesn't believe Chelsea FC will challenge for the Premier League title this season</h2>

      <h3>Jason McAteer says Chelsea FC aren’t Premier League title contenders this season.</h3>
      <p>Chelsea FC have earned plenty of plaudits so far this term for their entertaining football under club legend Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>The retired England midfielder took over the reins of the west London side from Maurizio Sarri in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old has placed his faith in youth at Chelsea FC, giving the likes of Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori the chance to shine.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are on a six-game winning run in the Premier League and have hoisted themselves about Manchester City into third position.</p>
      <p>Lampard’s men are level on points with second-placed Leicester City but the chasing pack find themselves eight points adrift of leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC midfielder McAteer doesn’t envisage Chelsea FC or Leicester mounting a sustained title challenge this season.</p>
      <p>“I still think there will be a title race and it will be between Liverpool and Man City,” McAteer told the <i>Racing Post</i>, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205654/Chelsea-news-Liverpool-Premier-League">Daily Express</a>.</p>
      <p>“What Brendan Rodgers is doing at Leicester is outstanding and the job Frank Lampard is doing at Chelsea is probably even more impressive.</p>
      <p>“I remember speaking to Frank when Chelsea and Liverpool played the Super Cup in Istanbul and you could hear his concerns.</p>
      <p>“Where were the goals going to come from? Could Mason Mount do for Chelsea what he had done for Derby? Would he miss Antonio Rudiger? But he and his players have answered all those questions and more.</p>
      <p>“I’m a big fan of Frank and think Chelsea can continue to improve but they aren’t title contenders this season.</p>
      <p>“Teams such as Chelsea and Leicester could easily go on a run of back-to-back losses, or picking up just a couple of draws in three matches, and that can lose you serious ground given the high standard set by Liverpool and City.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC were 2-0 winners against Crystal Palace last time out to extend their winning run to six games.</p>
      <p>The Blues have beaten Brighton, Southampton, Newcastle United, Burnley, Watford and Palace during their run.</p>
      <p>However, Lampard’s side will take on defending Premier League champions Manchester City at The Etihad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Blues lost 2-1 to Liverpool FC at Stamford Bridge back in September despite a valiant performance.</p>
