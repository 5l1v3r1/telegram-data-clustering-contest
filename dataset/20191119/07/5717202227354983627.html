      <h1>One Liverpool player in particular will hope Robertson recovers to face Palace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:45:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool defender Andy Robertson is currently an injury doubt for the weekend games against Crystal Palace (<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638?_ga=2.160273149.1714869024.1574069287-679019245.1527764585">Liverpool Echo</a>).</p>
      <p>The Reds go to Selhurst Park on Saturday in the hope of securing another three points, after a brilliant 3-1 win over title rivals Manchester City before the international break.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side have taken 34 points from a possible 36, and have lost just one game all season – against Napoli in the Champions League.</p>

      <p>Full-back Robertson has been in fine form as usual in 2019/20, but faces missing out against the Eagles as he continues to struggle with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The star was forced to miss out for Scotland over the international break and faces a race to be fit for Saturday.</p>
      <p>And Liverpool may be extra hopeful for his recovery, given who would likely have to replace him.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Milner hates playing against Zaha</h3>
      <p>He may not be having his best season, but Palace star Wilfried Zaha loves playing against James Milner, who would more than likely be the man to deputise for Robertson.</p>

      <p>The 33-year-old recently admitted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/28/james-milner-liverpool-interview-var-premier-league">in an interview with The Guardian</a> that the Ivorian has given him the most trouble out of anyone he’s ever faced in his career.</p>
      <p>He has twice been sent off for fouls on him, and Milner has described him as a ‘talent’ and ‘unpredictable’.</p>
      <p>As good as Milner is, there just seems to be something about facing Zaha, and Klopp and perhaps he himself will have everything crossed Robertson will be available for selection.</p>
