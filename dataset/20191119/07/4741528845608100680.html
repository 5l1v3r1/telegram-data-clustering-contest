      <p>The realisation of the <b>Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme</b> (NGFCP) will an advantageous to the country. According to Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, the programme could eliminate routine gas flares by 2020 and enable the government attain some of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
      <p><b>The Details: </b>This statement was made by Timipre Sylva, at the 29th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Nigerian Environment Society in Benin, Edo State. He was represented by the Programme Manager, NGFCP/Technical Adviser to the minister on Gas Business and Policy Implementation, Justice Derefaka, according to Punch.</p>
      <p><b>The Petroleum Minister explained</b> how the Ministry was committed to attaining the SDGs through the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme.</p>

      <p><b>Drumming support for the programme</b>, Sylva was optimistic that several employment opportunities would be created through it.</p>
      <p><b>Sylva’s words:</b> “<i>In my ministry, we have tested this approach with the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme and in addressing SDG-7, which is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.</i></p>
      <p><i>“The NGFCP ticks 14 of the 17 SDG boxes and this will stimulate action over the next two to three years in five areas of critical importance to the SDGs, which include people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership</i>.”</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Part of the plans to provide affordable</b>, reliable, and sustainable energy for all is the provision of three liquefied natural gas trains for the purpose of generating 3,000 megawatts of electricity and 600,000 metric tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas yearly.</p>
      <p><b>The Minister believed</b> this initiative would help reduce the cost of energy across the country.</p>
      <p><b>In a recent Nairametrics report</b>, the government said it was uncomfortable with the way gas was being flared in the country. Last year, the government announced an increment in the <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2018/10/02/fg-increases-penalty-on-gas-flaring-from-ngn10-to-usd2/">gas flaring penalty</a> from N10 per 1,000 Standard Cubic Feet (SCF) to $2 per 1,000 SCF of the commodity flared.</p>
      <p><b>In addition</b>, it stipulated a fine of N50,000 or a six months jail term or both, on anyone who provides inaccurate flare data.</p>
      <p><b>About the Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme: </b>The objective of the NGFCP is to provide a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nigeria-gas-flares-commercialisation-programme/about/">commercial approach</a> to the elimination of routine gas flares by 2020 and drive positive social, environmental and economic impacts in the Niger Delta by mobilising private sector capital towards gas flare capture projects.</p>
