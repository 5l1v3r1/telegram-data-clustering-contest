      <p>Ireland’s goalscorer Matt Doherty admitted their shots-shy record caught up with them in tonight’s concluding Euro qualifier.</p>
      <p>While the Wolves man grabbed his first international goal five minutes from full-time to cancel out Martin Braithwaite’s breakthrough 12 minutes earlier, the 1-1 draw sent Denmark into the finals at Ireland’s expense.</p>
      <p>The leveller was just the seventh goal of an eight-match campaign, a paltry return consigning Ireland to third place in Group D and the play-off semi-final next March.</p>
      <p>Doherty said: “It was a struggle for us to score throughout the entire campaign and we managed to get one, rather than two, tonight.</p>
      <blockquote>We wanted to stay in the game for as long as possible at nil-all and then put all the pressure on towards the end.</blockquote>
      <p>“Unfortunately, while only really did that when we went behind. They got to score from the one chance they had in the match.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit of a mountain to climb after that and we didn’t manage it.</p>
      <blockquote>It is sickening. We were probably the better team and definitely deserved to win the game.</blockquote>
      <p>“It is really flat inside in the dressing room but we still have the play-offs.”</p>
      <p>The Dubliner said the performance at Lansdowne Road bodes well for that semi-final. Ireland will face one of Slovakia, Wales or Bosnia-Herzegovina away from home on May 26.</p>
      <p>“Our shape and movement was good so if we can stay in form stay fit we will have a chance,” he added.</p>
