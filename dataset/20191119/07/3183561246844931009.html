      <p>With Disney+ and Apple TV+ now being launched in Australia, the streaming service market just got a whole lot more busy.</p>
      <p>Each service will be fighting to keep your attention and money so we thought we'd take a look at what each offers based on pricing, concurrent user offerings, display quality and content libraries to help you determine the best option available.</p>

      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>The cost of a streaming service is probably the most important aspect, alongside having quality content. While Netflix and Stan offer pretty identical pricing packages, the other four offerings vary.</p>
      <p>Foxtel Now, its set-top box-less streaming service, offers an entry package of $25 per month, despite <i>Game of Thrones</i> having already finished up (oh, sweetie). Amazon Prime Video is included with a monthly Amazon Prime membership of $6.99, which is a pretty sweet deal if you've already got it.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will cost $8.99 per month (or $7.41 a month if you pay for a year up front when it lands in Australia in November) and Apple TV+, released on November 1, costs $7.99 a month.</p>
      <p>Here's a neat table to compare the prices.</p>
      <table bordered="">
        <tr>
          <td/>
          <td>
            <b>Netflix</b>
          </td>
          <td>
            <b>Stan</b>
          </td>
          <td>
            <b>Foxtel</b>
          </td>
          <td>
            <b>Amazon Prime Video</b>
          </td>
          <td>
            <b>Disney+</b>
          </td>
          <td>
            <b>Apple TV+</b>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <b>Monthly Pricing</b>
          </td>
          <td>Three plans: $9.99, $13.99, $19.99</td>
          <td>Three plans: $10, $14, $17</td>
          <td>$25 with optional add-on packs</td>
          <td>$6.99, included with Amazon Prime membership</td>
          <td>One plan: $8.99 a month or $89 for a year (which works out to $7.41 a month)</td>
          <td>One plan: $7.99 a month</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Screens</h3>
      <p>Simultaneous streaming is a big deal for many as it means you'll be able to share your account (and <i>hopefully</i>, cost) with other people. Most of the streaming services recognise this with Netflix and Stan's second and top tier plans offering four screens while Foxtel and Amazon Prime Video offer two and three, respectively.</p>
      <p>Disney+ offers up to four screens for only $8.99, which is probably the best deal of the bunch. Apple TV+ is $7.99 and will allow up to six sharers on the same Family Sharing group. While this sounds amazing, the content is <i>damn light</i> but more on that later.</p>

          <td>Up to three</td>

          <td>Up to six with Family Sharing group</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Streaming quality</h3>
      <p>Netflix was the first in Australia to break up the plans by streaming quality and when 4K streaming was introduced, it was only offered for those on the top $17.99 plan.</p>
      <p>Stan follows Netflix in only offering its top plan 4K streaming with the entry-level plan not even having HD and the middle plan having standard HD. Foxtel's steeper entry-level package offers its on-demand content in HD and 4K where available along with Amazon Prime Video.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/disney-plus-pricing-australia">Disney+ is the service</a> to stick its finger up at tiered pricing and offer just the one plan, including HDR and 4K for everyone who subscribes. Apple TV+ is also following Disney with this trend.</p>

      <h3>Content</h3>
      <p>Each service will have a few great titles and while some shows will appear on multiple providers, it's the exclusives that allow you to whittle down your options. Netflix was really the first in the game so they naturally have the biggest quantity and most well-known titles like <i>Stranger Things</i> and <i>Orange Is The New Black</i>.</p>
      <p>Stan's original titles are a little more slim with the service relying more heavily on international partnerships with Hulu (<i>Veronica Mars</i> Season 4) and Starz (for e.g. <i>Apocalypse Now</i>) to fill out its content library. Foxtel also has quality HBO exclusives like <i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>Chernobyl</i> and <i>True Detective</i>.</p>
      <p>Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and Apple TV+ are also following the trend of producing original content, bucking the chance of losing content later down the track in licencing agreements.</p>
      <p>Here are a few highlights from each service.</p>
