      <h1>Hong Kong crisis: Protesters escape police lockdown by abseiling onto motorbikes</h1>
      <h2>Some commentators said the brazen escape channeled the 'spirit of Dunkirk' as around 200 protesters remained in Hong Kong Polytechnic University last night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:09:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:09</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>This dramatic footage shows the moment Hong Kong protesters evaded police by abseiling down a bridge and escaping on waiting motorbikes.</p>
      <p>The activists were filmed sneaking out of Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Monday night and shimmying down plastic hosing. </p>
      <p>Some commentators say the effort to help demonstrators flee the police lockdown channels the 'spirit of Dunkirk', <a href="https://twitter.com/jamespomfret/status/1196433798197477376">Reuters</a> reports.</p>
      <p>About 200 protesters were still inside the sealed-off university campus last night, raising fears of bloody clashes with no resolution in sight.</p>
      <p>The former British colony appointed a new head of police, Chris Tang, on Tuesday to oversee the city's force of more than 30,000 officers.</p>

      <p>Tang said he and his colleagues were not able to end the protests alone.</p>
      <p>He also claimed "fake news" was undermining the reputation of Hong Kong police.</p>
      <p>Police allowed two prominent figures onto the campus late on Monday to mediate but many protesters refused to leave voluntarily.</p>
      <p>The university, in the centre of the bustling Kowloon peninsula, is the last campus still occupied by activists during a week of often violent protests.</p>

      <p>Demonstrators said supplies, including food, were dwindling rapidly.</p>
      <p>One demonstrator, 21, said: "There have been so many people who have sacrificed for this.</p>
      <p>"Some people just don't give a s***. They just want to sit back and wait for a successful result."</p>
      <p>Demonstrators are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in Hong Kong's promised freedoms when the former British colony <br/>returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>

      <p>They also say they are responding to excessive use of force by police.</p>
      <p>China says it is committed to the "one country, two systems" formula granting Hong Kong autonomy.</p>
      <p>The city's police deny accusations of brutality and say they have shown restraint.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she hoped the university standoff could be resolved peacefully, although she was shocked that campuses had been turned into "weapons factories".</p>
