      <p>If you’ve been on Twitter today, you’ll probably have noticed an unusual hashtag has been dominating the Twitter-sphere for the best part of the last few hours.</p>
      <p>#Fartgate is the newest political scandal to rock the US after Congressman Eric Swalwell ripped one live on international television.</p>
      <p>In a live broadcast to Hardball host Chris Matthews, Rep. Swalwell was discussing the impeachment proceedings of Donald Trump when he let out what can only be described as an absolutely enormous fart.</p>

      <p>Thanks to the glorious world of social media, the moment was quickly posted to Twitter where it was given its own watergate-esque nickname, #fartgate.</p>
      <p>While Australians find political-correctness a divisive topic in today’s society, one thing we can all agree on, is farts are almost always - if not always - still funny.</p>
      <p>#Fartgate is an example of that, as over 100K tweets have been posted since the interview aired on MSNBC at around 8am AWST.</p>

      <p>After the hashtag rose to the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide, the Hardball show addressed it on their account, pointing to host Chris Matthew’s mug as the culprit behind the suspicious noise.</p>
      <p>Rep. Swalwell responded to the Tweet, declaring ‘TOTAL EXONERATION!’ which - to be fair - is a great way to clear your name without coming across as a total white bread politician.</p>

      <p>But Twitter wasn’t buying it.</p>
      <p>From conspiracy theories to a plethora of meme responses, the social media platform had made up its mind that it was a politically-charged fart from either a TV host or a Congressman.</p>
      <p>And honestly, it doesn’t even matter who, what or where the noise came from - the internet wins again.</p>
