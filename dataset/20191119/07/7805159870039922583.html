      <h1>YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium prepaid plans are now available in India</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:24:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year in March, Google <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/youtube-music-premium-india/">launched YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium</a> in India. At the time of launch, the services were only available to users as a postpaid subscription. Users were required to add a payment method at the time of subscription which was auto-debited every month to renew the subscription. Now, Google is finally offering a prepaid alternative, allowing users to subscribe to the service without requiring a credit card.</p>
      <p>As per a recent blog post from the company, users in India will now be able to purchase a one-month or three-month prepaid plan to enjoy YouTube Premium and Music Premium. Additionally, users will be allowed to extend their membership by a month or three months at any point using top-ups. The prepaid plans offer all the same benefits, however, the pricing is slightly different.</p>
      <p>The one-month YouTube Premium prepaid plan is priced at ₹139, as opposed to the monthly subscription which costs ₹129. The three-month plan, on the other hand, is priced at ₹399. The one-month prepaid plan for Music Premium is priced at ₹109, while the three-month plan will cost you ₹309. The monthly subscription plan for Music Premium is priced at ₹99.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth noting that users who opt for the monthly subscription plan receive an additional month of free service, while no such benefit is extended to prepaid plan users. You can follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/offers?ybp=OgIIAUoNCAYSCXVubGltaXRlZHoCCAE%253D">this link</a> if you wish to purchase the YouTube Premium prepaid plan or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/musicpremium/offers?ybp=OgIIAUoVCAYSEXVubGltaXRlZC1CLW11c2ljegIIAQ%253D%253D">this link</a> if you wish to purchase the prepaid plan for Music Premium. Do note that YouTube Premium includes all the benefits extended to Music Premium subscribers so you don’t have to purchase both the plans separately.</p>
