      <h3>Race 1 – 3:10PM THE AGENCY REAL ESTATE PLATE (1100 METRES)</h3>
      <p><b>3. Hinchbeast</b> showed a heap of improvement into his second trial which he won with a leg in the air. Didn’t wear blinkers there and he looked pretty good so hopefully putting them on for race day won’t work against him. Hugh Bowman and gate one look positives and he should take beating.</p>

      <p><i>Dangers:</i> <b>7. Jemss</b> trialled quite well just behind Dame Giselle and Tilia Rose, which has proven to be good form, a month ago then missed a start in the Golden Gift before winning a trial at Rosehill last week. Looks a professional type of filly and commands respect. <b>6. Volterra</b> cost $1.3 million as a yearling and is a full brother to Faretti. Sat behind the speed and came off the leader’s back to win a trial at Rosehill last week, almost a second slower than Jemss, so does have good race sense. Keep in mind and any betting moves might be significant. <b>4. Important Product</b> appeared like he would improve off his only trial to date, at Warwick Farm two weeks ago, and Kerrin McEvoy booked to ride could be a pointer he has some talent. Again, check betting.</p>

      <h3>Race 2 - 3:45PM BOWERMANS OFFICE FURNITURE PLATE (1900 METRES)</h3>
      <p><b>6. Pincer</b> won’t have a better chance to break through than in this race where he looks to get complete control in front. Better for the run over this trip at Gosford where he tried to lead all the way but was run down late. He’s no good thing by any means but can’t go past.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers:</i> <b>1. Estroverto</b> is a 15-start maiden with five minor placings on end to his name this time in. Loomed to win at Newcastle last time when well supported then found one better. No excuses here, Bowman rides from the inside alley and no surprise if he finally cracks it. <b>3. Wristband</b> comes through the same race as Pincer and while he was a $61 chance there he hit the line with a bit of</p>
      <p>purpose. First time he’s been placed in 10 starts but if that is the right form line he has to be a chance. <b>7. Shadow Girl</b> looked to have her chance when beaten as a short priced favourite at Hawkesbury at start two. Extra trip may assist and if there is any improvement this time in she can be in the finish somewhere.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Pincer WIN; Odds &amp; Evens: SPLIT.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 3 – 4.20PM RIBCHESTER @ DARLEY HANDICAP (1400 METRES)</h3>
      <p><b>1. Mission Dream</b> doesn’t need to be a star to post a debut win but he might need to be able to take advantage of a good gate in a race that lacks obvious speed. Two trials have been nice and he worked home well in the latest without pressure. Any late support would be encouraging.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers:</i><b> 6. Bacchus</b> has largely raced better performed horses and resumes as a gelding with one very cushy trial behind him. Likely gets back from the wide alley (keep an ear out for tactics changes) but if the can run on he is entitled to feature. <b>4. Rari</b> resumed with an even effort at Hawkesbury as favourite a few weeks back then sent back to the trials. Jumps to 1400m with blinkers on here so give another chance. <b>3. Deadly Impact</b> wouldn’t shock if he bobbed up here first-up. Both his trials have been exce</p>
      <p>llent and he did make ground though well beaten on debut. Not out of it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Mission Dream WIN; Trifecta 1,6/1,3,4,6/1,3,4,6. Odds &amp; Evens: SPLIT.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 4 – 4.55PM IRON JACK HANDICAP (1100 METRES)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>7. Aquitaine</b>
      </p>
      <p>ran well in both starts in June and her effort last time out when almost falling out of the gates is much better than it looked. Scratched at the barrier from a planned run on July 6 then spelled. Liked both her trials and from gate two with J-Mac up she’s hard to beat.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers:</i> <b>1. Krameric</b> hasn’t raced for almost a year and must have had an issue in the autumn as he trialled once then went back to the paddock. Safely held in his trial but when let go he worked home stylishly. If the race pans out for him speed wise he should be charging home. <b>2. Wandabaa</b> had her first go at midweek level after three nice wins out of town and battled on well after having a nice run finishing third to Mansa Musa. Down a notch benchmark wise and must be considered. <b>3. Belitsa</b> ran on without threatening into the placings in a couple of late season two-year-old city races. She’s been handier in her trials, can’t fault her consistency so she has claims.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Aquitaine WIN; Trifecta 7/1,2,3/1,2,3. Odds &amp; Evens: ODDS.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 5 – 5.30PM TAB HANDICAP (1900 METRES)</h3>
      <p>No reason to jump off <b>1. Miss Moana</b> who comes off a dominant win over 3200m just third-up from a spell at Randwick last time. No speed engaged here so she should press forward and can’t see an extra 2kg causing her any issues in this company. The one to beat again.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers:</i> <b>5. Eugenio</b> ran on okay into third behind Miss Moana last start and on face value would seem unlikely to be able to turn the tables but the 2400m might suit him better. He smashed a C1 field at Kembla over this trip two runs back so may be a threat. <b>4. Loveseat</b> ran on well from a long way back over 2200m at Warwick Farm then dropped 500m and wasn’t beaten too far at Flemington in a BM70. Racing well and is capable of winning this. <b>3. Curata Princess</b> comes back in class after a much improved second at Rosehill in two Saturdays ago. Can be enigmatic but well placed class wise so entitled to be in the finish.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Miss Moana WIN; Trifecta 1/ 3,4,5/3,4,5. Odds &amp; Evens: ODDS.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 6 – 6.05PM PRESS STATEMENT @ VINERY HANDICAP (1400 METRES)</h3>
      <p><b>2. Spencer</b> was a sneakily good run first-up at Randwick with 61kg over an unsuitable trip. Clocked the fastest last 200m of the race running ninth there and is much better placed at 1400m. Second-up record is patchy but looks enough speed here to give him every chance to run on.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers:</i> <b>1. McCormack</b> found his best form to post a narrow win over this trip in similar grade last time and can be expected to hold that form now. Claim helps, drawn well and one of the chances again. <b>3. Orcein</b> finds it hard to win them but always runs on as he did along the inside into third over 1550m at Randwick third-up. His chances will be dictated by the speed in the race but can’t be left out. <b>5. Showminder</b> was narrowly beaten by McCormack last time out in a much improved effort. He generally puts a few good runs together once in form so he is an each-way hope again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Spencer E/W. Odds &amp; Evens: SPLIT.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Race 7 - 6:40PM ROSEHILL BOWLING CLUB HANDICAP (1500 METRES)</h3>
      <p><b>9. Wicked Wench</b> is coming off a Hawkesbury maiden win at her Australian debut but there was something about it that suggests she’s above average. Sat wide throughout and powered away late and can only be fitter and more suited to the extra trip. Drawn to stalk and is a threat.</p>
      <p><i>Dangers:</i> <b>2. Statuesquely</b> has been costly in two runs back where she’s appeared to have every chance. Granted she didn’t lead last time but still no excuses. The blinkers going on is an interesting move so it warrants giving her another shot. <b>7. Rockarosa</b> is a last start Gosford maiden winner over Bigboyroy who then won a maiden easily at Canterbury last Friday. Whether that’s either a good pointer or not remains to be seen but she’s a filly on the up and is in the mix. <b>6. The Promise</b> hasn't raced for six weeks but is an honest mare and picking back up at this trip is suitable. Can find it hard to win so each-way claims probably best.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to play it: Wicked Wench E/W; Trifecta 2,9/2,6,7,9/2,6,7,9. Odds &amp; Evens: SPLIT</b>
