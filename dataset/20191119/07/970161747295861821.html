      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a> and Cody Simpson’s romance has been blazing hot and heavy since they first hooked up back in October.</p>
      <p>But it seems the pair are starting to cool things off.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Miley, 26, wants to focus on herself and is backing off from her relationship with the Australian singer for now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/11/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-split-on-break-whirlwind-romance/">A source told Radar Online:</a> ‘They are taking a break, but want to remain friends.</p>
      <p>‘She said she just needs to focus on herself.’</p>

      <p>Miley and Cody, 22, have been piling on the PDA across social media after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/04/miley-cyrus-seen-kissing-singer-cody-simpson-following-split-from-kaitlynn-carter-10859984/">first being pictured kissing in early October</a> – from sharing pictures with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/16/miley-cyrus-handsy-cody-simpson-topless-selfie-hints-marriage-death-us-10932079/">Miley’s hands down her beau’s pants</a>, to making out <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-dont-let-halloween-interrupt-pda-spree-channel-rock-legends-11023558/">dressed as Billy Idol and Perri Lister for Halloween.</a></p>

      <p>But it’s been claimed that all the oversharing was a plan to get a rise out of Miley’s ex-husband Liam Hemsworth, who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/11/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-split-less-year-marriage-love-officially-dead-10551978/">she split from in August after eight months of marriage.</a></p>
      <p>An insider added to Radar: ‘This romance with Cody…and constant “look at me” behaviour is all designed to push Liam’s buttons— and to be fair it’s always worked in the past because he’s a good guy who ultimately loves her.</p>
      <p>‘But now he’s just rolling his eyes and washing his hands of her, even as a friend, which of course is driving Miley nuts.’</p>

      <p>Even Cody’s mum <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/cody-simpsons-mum-claims-son-girlfriend-miley-cyrus-playing-cameras-love-media-attention-11038214/">reckons that the constant PDAs were all a bit of an attention-seeking mission</a>, with Angie telling the Kyle and Jackie O Show: ‘I think that they’re doing it for a bit of fun and looking for exactly what the media is saying.</p>
      <p>‘They’re like two peas in a pod. We were just on FaceTime with them this morning. They’re in Nashville having a bit of a holiday and I just think they like to play it up.’</p>
      <p>The pair haven’t actually shared much about each other in recent weeks – Miley last mentioned Cody on 3 November on her Instagram story, while Simpson last shared a mention of the Hannah Montana star on 8 November.</p>

      <p>If Miley is indeed taking some time off from their romance to focus on herself, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise.</p>
      <p>Since splitting from Liam, 29, three months ago, the Wrecking Ball singer has also had a romance with Kaitlynn Carter, who she was pictured kissing in Lake Como just after her divorce announcement.</p>
      <p>However, 31-year-old Kaitlynn, who had just broken up with husband Brody Jenner, and Miley <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/22/miley-cyrus-kaitlynn-carter-split-just-month-dating-10786089/">ended things after a month of dating.</a></p>
