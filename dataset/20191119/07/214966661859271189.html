      <h1>Seven charged after raids targeting Mongols members </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/mmcdonald/" target="_blank">Matt McDonald</a></address>
      <p>Police have arrested seven people following a series of raids on the Gold Coast and other parts of the south-east targeting the Mongols outlaw motorcycle gang.</p>
      <p>Search warrants were executed on properties at Broadbeach, Biggera Waters, Coomera, Miami, Beenleigh, Eagleby and Caboolture as part of pre-emptive action by Police.</p>
      <p>$75,000 worth of the drug ice along with GHB and steroids were found during the Biggera Waters raid.</p>
      <p>A sawn-off shotgun, a handgun, knuckle dusters and ammunition were also found inside a car at the same property.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old member of the Mongols was charged with numerous offences including two counts of unlawful possession of a weapon, possession of explosives and possession of dangerous drugs.</p>
      <p>He is due to appear in Southport Magistrates Court on November 20.</p>
      <p>The other raids netted a handgun, prohibited Mongols items, drug utensils, prescription drugs, cash and vehicles.</p>
      <p>A number of mobile phones were also seized and will be examined by Police.</p>
      <p>Police say the action aimed to dismantle and disrupt the operations of the group which they say poses a risk to the safety of the Queensland community.</p>
      <p>These targeted operations which also include partnerships with interstate and international law enforcement agencies, will continue, ensuring a borderless and agile approach in targeting unlawful activities.”</p>
