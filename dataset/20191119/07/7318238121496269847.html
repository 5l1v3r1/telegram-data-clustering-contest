      <p>National police on Sunday said six men, including two nationals, have been arrested in the robbery and murder. Police are searching for one other who they have called a fugitive.</p>
      <p>Anton, who died from asphyxiation, was found strangled and bound in her apartment, police said. A cellphone, 40-inch television and around $80 in cash were stolen.</p>
      <p>The seven people accused in the slaying are thought to have traveled to Puerto Plata "to commit criminal acts in that city," the national police statement says.</p>
      <p>Anton was a teacher and consultant at a Montessori school, where she worked for six years. Her cousin, Adrianne Machina, said she is "heartbroken" and devastated by her death.</p>
      <p>"I can't imagine what kind of monster could do something like that to such a kind soul," Machina said last week.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://3mariposasmontessori.com/content/staff/patty-anton/">the school's website</a>, Anton was born in Italy and spent "a large portion of her life traveling with her family before settling down in Michigan to raise her own family."</p>
      <p>She also served as a legislative aide at the Michigan State Capital and volunteered in Guatemala City, Guatemala, and Matagorda in the Dominican Republic prior to joining 3 Mariposas Montessori's faculty.</p>
