      <p><b>ANKARA, TurkeyÂ (AP)</b> - Turkey's state-run news agency says prosecutors have issued warrants for the detention of 133 military officers over suspected links to the U.S.-based Muslim cleric who is blamed by Ankara for a failed coup attempt in 2016.</p>
      <p>Anadolu Agency said Tuesday that 101 of the suspects were detained in simultaneous raids in 45 provinces for alleged links to Fethullah Gulen's network.</p>
      <p>Police were searching for 32 other suspects.</p>
      <p>The agency says 82 of the suspects targeted by the warrants are officers currently serving in the military. They include three colonels, five majors and five lieutenants.</p>
      <p>Some 77,000 people have been arrested and around 130,000 others, including military personnel, have been dismissed from state jobs in a government crackdown on Gulen's network since the coup.</p>
      <p>Gulen denies involvement.</p>
