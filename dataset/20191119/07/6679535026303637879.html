      <p>Former Minister and Congress MLA Tanveer Sait, who was brutally <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tanveer-sait-attacked-at-a-wedding-undergoes-surgery/article30004090.ece">assaulted with a machete</a> on November 17 night, is responding to medical treatment and his condition is improving.</p>
      <p>According to doctors of Columbia Asia Hospital in Mysuru, where Mr. Sait underwent surgery, the condition of the MLA is stable. However, Mr Sait continues to remain in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital. He has been off the ventilator since November 18 evening.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the City police has suspended Fairoz Khan, the City Armed Reserve (CAR) constable, deployed as Mr. Sait’s gunman. He has been suspended on charges of dereliction of duty, said City Police Commissioner K.T. Balakrishna. “Though he was behind Mr Sait when the attack took place, he failed to act”, said a police official.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sit-to-probe-attack-on-tanveer-sait/article30010405.ece">Special Investigation Team</a> (SIT) set up by the City police and headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) M. Muthuraj, is continuing its probe to explore various angles of the assault on the MLA.</p>
      <p>The assailant, Farhan Pasha, a 24-year-old handicraft artisan, had swung the machete at Mr. Sait’s neck while he was watching an orchestra after a wedding ceremony at Bal Bhavan in Mysuru late on November 17 night.</p>
