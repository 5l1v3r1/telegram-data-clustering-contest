      <h1>Musharraf treason case: Special court to announce verdict on Nov 28</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:20:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/4604/hasnaat-malik/" target="_blank">Hasnaat Malik</a></address>
      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>The special court hearing a high treason case against former military ruler General (retd) Pervez Musharraf will announce its verdict on November 28.</p>
      <p>After a passage of six years, the three-judge special court led by Justice Waqar Ahmed Seth reserved its verdict on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The case against the military dictator was filed by the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) government in late 2013 for subverting the Constitution when he imposed a state of emergency on November 3, 2007.</p>
      <p>Musharraf seized power in 1999 after a coup against then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif who had tried to remove him as army chief.</p>

      <p>He was forced out nine years later when threatened with impeachment and lived in self-imposed exile till his return to Pakistan in March 2013.</p>
      <p>Musharraf became Pakistan’s first army chief to be charged with treason when he was indicted on March 31, 2014.</p>
      <p>He pleaded not guilty to five charges and dismissed them as being politically motivated.</p>
      <p>The trial, however, could not be concluded over the past six years due to several reasons.</p>
      <p>First, the special court initially directed the federal government to include three more individuals and initiate a treason case against them.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the proceedings remained suspended for a couple of years until the Supreme Court set aside the special court’s order and directed it to proceed against Musharraf only.</p>
      <p>In March 2016, the former army chief left Pakistan to seek medical treatment in Dubai.</p>
      <p>In October this year, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government de-notified the prosecution team which was hired in December 2013 by the PML-N government.</p>
      <p>Renowned lawyer Akram Sheikh was heading the prosecution team. He resigned soon after the PTI’s victory in the 2018 general elections and the remaining team members were sacked this year.</p>
