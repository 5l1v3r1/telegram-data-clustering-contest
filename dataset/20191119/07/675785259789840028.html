      <h1>Richard Keys denies he left cancer-stricken wife for daughter's friend</h1>
      <h2>Former Sky Sports presenter Richard Keys divorced his wife Julia but has denied newspaper reports that he had an affair with a friend of his daughter's</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:52:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Richard Keys has denied that he left his cancer-stricken wife for a friend of his daughter's.</p>
      <p>Former Sky Sports presenter Keys was married to wife Julia for 36 years before their marriage came crashing down amid an alleged affair with Lucie Jones, a 28-year-old lawyer.</p>
      <p>But Keys has flat-out denied the allegation, claiming the lie has been told so much it has "become the truth".</p>
      <p>“I’ll mention the unmentionable for you," he told <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1387749/2019/11/19/dinosaurs-ruled-the-world-for-300-million-years-so-if-thats-what-i-am-so-be-it-keys-and-gray-on-life-after-sky/?redirected=1&amp;redirected=1">The Athletic.</a> "Did I leave my wife fighting cancer? No. I don’t know what happened,</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why our marriage ended the way it did, but my wife was fighting cancer for seven years before I left her and she had been in remission for seven years.</p>

      <p>"She and I went to London every day of her fight, prior to a ground-breaking operation that saw her in a period of recovery.</p>
      <p>“Julia had been in remission for seven years. I know how hard it was for her when things went wrong. I wasn’t going to start engaging in a tit-for-tat, he-said, she-said, respond to everything that was said about me.</p>
      <p>“If people believe that I walked away with my wife fighting cancer with a friend of my daughter’s, I can’t change that now. Tell a lie twice and it becomes the truth. Tell it on social media and it haunts you forever.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t fall in love with a friend of my daughter’s. I am aghast at the standard of journalism in the UK now.”</p>
      <p>In her book The MANScript, Keys' ex-wife Julia wrote about the divorce, saying the alleged affair "devastated" their two children.</p>
      <p>"Richard's affair didn't just devastate my world, but the world of our children Jemma and Josh too," she said.</p>
      <p>"It is only now, two years on, that he has admitted he did have an affair with Lucie, as well as acknowledging his deceit and the damage it has caused.</p>
      <p>"But for a year and a half he was telling me it was all in my head, that I was imagining it, that I was going mad — lines that I now realise nearly every man comes up with when having an affair."</p>
