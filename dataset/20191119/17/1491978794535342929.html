        <i><b>Exclusive</b>: Survey reveals almost all are paid per delivery and a quarter of riders have been in an accident</i>
      </p>
      <p>Food delivery bike couriers are being underpaid by up to $322 a week compared with minimum rates of pay and superannuation in the transport award, according to new union statistics.</p>
      <p>The Young Workers Centre – an initiative of the Victoria Trades Hall Council – conducted a survey of more than 240 riders, revealing most are engaged on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis and almost all are paid per delivery, with no minimum rates of pay.</p>
      <p>Bike couriers at companies such as Deliveroo are employed as independent contractors, meaning they are not paid the award minimum rate of $25.81 per hour they would be entitled to if classed as employees.</p>
      <p>According to the centre, a typical courier working 24 hours a week including six hours at the higher weekend rate would receive $681 under the award and $65 in super.</p>
      <p>Although pay was as high as $18.50 an hour with a $2.50 delivery commission when delivery apps entered the market in late 2015, the Transport Workers’ Union argues that through a series of unilateral pay cuts conditions have ratcheted down to flat rates of $10 a delivery, or as low as $5.90 for some deliveries under new dynamic pricing systems.</p>
      <p>A typical courier paid $10 per delivery might make 53 deliveries, for a weekly pay packet of $530, about $151 under the award, the rider snapshot said.</p>
      <p>Under an alternative dynamic pay method of $3.50 per pickup, $1.80 per delivery and a variable fee based on time and distance, a courier might earn as little as $424 a week, some $322 less than the award rate when superannuation is factored in.</p>
      <p>Unions have been rocked by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/07/uber-drivers-are-not-employees-fair-work-ombudsman-rules">the Fair Work Ombudsman’s claim in June</a> that ridesharing company Uber does not directly employ its drivers, fearing that it will solidify the existing practice in the gig economy to classify workers as independent contractors.</p>
      <p>In 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/australias-fair-work-watchdog-takes-legal-action-against-foodora">the ombudsman took court action against food delivery company Foodora</a>, alleging that bike couriers are employees, which the administrators of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/foodora-condemned-for-closing-australian-operation-during-back-pay-dispute">now-collapsed Foodora Australia</a> admitted is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/10/foodora-australia-admits-riders-owed-5m-were-more-likely-than-not-employees">“more likely than not” to be true</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Uber Eats and Deliveroo maintain their couriers are independent contractors. In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/18/sacking-of-uber-eats-driver-allegedly-for-a-late-food-delivery-compared-to-modern-slavery">unfair dismissal case before the Fair Work Commission which began on Monday</a>, the TWU is seeking to prove Uber Eats drivers are in fact employees.</p>
      <p>The survey found that the average age of riders is 26, while three-quarters are temporary visa holders such as international students, or people on working holiday or bridging visas. Just one in 10 surveyed was an Australian citizen.</p>
      <p>Only 2% of riders said they would not negotiate for a pay rise as they were happy with current pay rates, while 60% said it is “not possible to negotiate a pay rise”.</p>
      <p>One-quarter of surveyed couriers had been in an accident, with one in eight sustaining injuries such as concussions, knee injuries, broken bones or dislocations.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday the TWU will release a proposed charter of rights for delivery drivers including the minimum wage, paid wait times, penalty rates, an allowance for bad weather and fully-funded workers compensation.</p>
      <p>The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber">Uber</a> and Deliveroo “need to sign up to the charter of rights” to fix what the TWU alleges are the “appalling practices” of “ripping workers off … and throwing [them] on the scrap heap when they are injured or no longer useful”.</p>
      <p>“Through the charter [riders] want an end to the ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ practice where they carry all the liability and Uber and Deliveroo accept none of the responsibility,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Riders are taking this stand amidst the absence of any semblance of interest from the federal government which has outright refused to support them.”</p>
      <p>VTHC secretary Luke Hilakari said the delivery riders snapshot “paints a picture of extreme worker exploitation in the food delivery industry”.</p>
      <p>“The likes of Uber and Deliveroo need to accept that if they want to operate in the Australian market, they need to abide by Australian employment law.”</p>
