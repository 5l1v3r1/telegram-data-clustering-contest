      <p>Kamloops RCMP are encouraging the public to report non-emergency crimes, which have no witnesses or suspects, on its new online platform.</p>
      <p>Such crimes include damage or mischief to a vehicle or property, theft of a bicycle, theft from a vehicle, or any other theft, as long as any reported theft or damage is under $5,000. The online tool will also allow users to report stolen property and hit and run incidents involving an unoccupied vehicle or property.</p>
      <p>Any crimes with witnesses or suspects must be reported to the RCMP in traditional protocol. Any lost, damaged, or stolen items valued over $5,000 must also go through the full RCMP reporting process. This new system also doesn't allow for reporting of any items involving a person's identity, such as license plates, firearms or decals.</p>
      <p>Kamloops RCMP hope this new tool will allow emergency personnel to focus their time on more serious crimes and emergencies.</p>
      <p>“One of the ways police learn where to concentrate our resources is to hear directly from our citizens. Crime reports from the public are an essential part of determining how our policing resources are deployed in the city,” says Supt. Syd Lecky, officer in charge with the Kamloops RCMP. “This additional reporting tool will enhance our service delivery to residents of Kamloops by making it more convenient to report less serious crimes, while allowing police to focus on emergency calls for service.”</p>
