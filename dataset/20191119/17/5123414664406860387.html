      <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/soukah">Soukah</a> has had a heavy run of eclectic releases spanning a whole host of labels such as Dubtribu Records, Rarefied, Locus Sound &amp; more. He doesn't have a specific style to his productions, however it's quite clear he definitely likes to get experimental. Sometimes he might make a fun, up beat, happy track, other times he may make a dark, sub heavy, dubstep roller, perfect for a sound system, and then he might create an emotive, atmospheric instrumental that could slip into the score of a film soundtrack effortlessly. He really is incredibly versatile when it comes to production. He's put together a really special guest mix for us below. Various dubs &amp; unreleased bits feature. Have a listen below, big up Soukah every time.</p>
