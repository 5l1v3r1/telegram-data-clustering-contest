      <p>The Sovereignty Movement welcomed the U.S. President's declaration that settlement in Judea and Samaria does not violate international law.</p>
      <p>"The words of the American President faithfully express the historical truth and international law which states that Judea and Samaria are part of the territory designated for the establishment of a Jewish home for the Jewish people. President Trump continues in his consistent way, standing to the right of Israel and to the right of justice and truth. "</p>
      <p>Leaders of the Movement, Yehudit Katsover and Nadia Matar: "The sovereignty process continues to progress step by step as a just and moral act that will create regional stability and security.</p>
      <p>"The Trump era is a historic opportunity for the Israeli government to promote its Zionist goals on to its historical mission‚Äù.</p>
