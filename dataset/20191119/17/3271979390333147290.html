      <p><b>Katie Holmes</b> and <b>Justin Theroux</b> are not “getting serious,” as a tabloid is wrongly reporting. The two stars aren’t dating at all. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can set the record straight on this fake ongoing saga.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <i>Star</i> published a bogus cover story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-justin-theroux-dating/">Holmes and Theroux going on a secret date in New York City</a>. The article was based on claims from an anonymous source, but the actress’s spokesperson told <b>Gossip Cop</b> on the record that the date never happened. In fact, Holmes’ rep told plainly told us, “Katie doesn’t know Justin.” Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped other publications from picking up the false premise and running with it.</p>
      <p>The latest issue of <b><i>Woman’s Day</i></b> says Holmes and Theroux have been on a string of dates following their supposed meetup last month, including a “cozy dinner at her apartment, where it’s believed he stayed the night.” A supposed insider tells the magazine, “One of her friends was chatting on the phone the morning after and she swears she heard Justin in the background.”</p>
      <p>From there, the tabloid dredges up Holmes’ past relationships with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, as well as Theroux’s divorce from Jennifer Aniston, before insisting Holmes and Theroux are the ones who were meant for each other all along. The reason? They’re both New Yorkers who “love indie movies,” says the unknown tipster. While that might be true, it hardly makes them soulmates.</p>
      <p>The seemingly phony source goes on to say that despite Holmes and Theroux’s relationship blossoming, they’re “trying very badly” to take things slow for the sake of her 13-year-old daughter Suri. “But Suri has met Justin,” adds the suspicious tipster, “and she’s convinced her mom to go for it.”</p>
      <p>As <b>Gossip Cop</b> stressed above, not only are Holmes and Theroux not a couple, but they don’t even know each other. The tabloids seem to be linking the two because both live in New York and are single following high-profile breakups from other stars. This also isn’t the first time <i>Woman’s Day</i> has exploited this phony topic.</p>
      <p>Last week, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the publication for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-tom-cruise-katie-holmes-justin-theroux-romance/">Cruise and Aniston were upset about Holmes and Theroux getting together</a>. That made-up scenario was just a weak attempt at throwing a whole bunch of A-listers into the same article. Cruise and Aniston aren’t bothered by an imaginary romance between their respective exes.</p>
      <p>The fake narratives on this subject have been even more far-fetched than that. Just this week, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out <i>NW</i> for insisting <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-pregnant-jamie-foxx-justin-theroux-baby/">Holmes was pregnant and the baby belonged to either Theroux or Foxx</a>. This latest piece is just another entry in a fictional tabloid soap opera.</p>
