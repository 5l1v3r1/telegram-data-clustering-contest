        <b>Christmas and trains, The Santa Special, have long held a special relationship, particularly since Robert Zemeckis' animated film The Polar Express captured the imaginations of young and old alike. There is something magical about families clambering aboard a steam train and heading off for an adventure together.</b>

      <p>Here are some of the Santa Special train events across Suffolk and East Anglia</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mid-Suffolk Light Railway - December 7, limited places on December 7,8,14</b>
      </p>
      <p>Passengers will travel from Brockford Station to meet Santa at the North Pole Halt. Each child will receive a special ticket and be given a present by Santa in his 'magic brake van'.</p>

      <p>The Middy will be decorated in festive fashion for each of the Santa Special days, with a band of elves also on hand to ensure everyone is having fun. It's the type of event that memories are created for the whole family. All tickets for this christmas extravaganza must be pre-booked - so don't miss out and get your tickets fast.</p>
      <p>The idea is to provide a seasonal appeal to families with the objective of introducing the museum to new generations who may never have seen a stream train before.</p>
      <p>This is a pre-booked event only. December 15, 21 and 22 are now fully booked, with limited spaces available on 7, 8 and 14. Please contact the railway museum if you would like to book dates that are already full and they will add you to the waiting list in case of cancellations.</p>
      <p>Tickets £12.50 per person adults and children.</p>

        <b>Colne Valley Railway - December 7-8; 14-15; 21-23</b>
      </p>
      <p>Join the heated special train as it gently steams along the one mile of line near to Castle Hedingham in Essex whilst Santa delivers a present to every child on the train. It's one of the most special events of the year and everyone can recapture the excitement of those days of steam. Trains run at 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 13:30, 14:30, 15:30 &amp; 16:30, so there is plenty of opportunity to jump aboard.</p>
      <p>Full refreshment service available with mulled wine, Christmas hot chocolate, childrens meals and snacks.</p>

      <p>A limited number of wheelchairs can be accomodated on each train but please phone to book. Unfortunately, there is no room for pushchairs on the Santa train due to the age and historic nature of the coaches (narrow internal passageways and doors) but can be left on the platform in designated areas (at owners risk).</p>
      <p>Please note: There are no toilets on the trains. Tickets are £12 with babies (0-2) £5</p>
      <p>Enjoy travelling along an award winning period country railway with relocated station buildings, signal boxes and bridges all lovingly restored and rebuilt. A large and varied collection of vintage steam and diesel engines, carriages and wagons that represent much of our railway heritage.</p>

        <b>The Polar Express - The Norfolk Express from end of November until Christmas</b>

      <p>Love the movie? Then you'll definitely love this.</p>
      <p>The Polar Express Train Ride is returning to the Mid-Norfolk Railway again in 2019, with the magic of the 2004 motion picture being theatrically re-created so you and your family can be immersed in the sights, sounds and intrigue of this classic tale.</p>
      <p>The fun starts at Dereham Station, in Norfolk, and once on the train - which you are encouraged to board wearing your pyjamas - scenes from the film will come to life as dancing chefs and waiters arrive to serve cookies and hot chocolate, and tell the tale of the Polar Express.</p>
      <p>Upon arrival at the North Pole, keep your eyes peeled for Santa's sleigh, a bag of toys and a giant Christmas tree, before returning home with more surprises on the return.</p>
      <p>Different prices apply on different days - the experience is the same but the prices differ.</p>
      <p>Tickets on peak days, including December 20, 21, 22 and 23, cost £27.50 for standard seating and £42 for premium seating.</p>
