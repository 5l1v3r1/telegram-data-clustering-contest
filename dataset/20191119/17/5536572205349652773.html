      <p>Davie police state the unnamed woman and Walton 1st got into an argument around 4:15 a.m. which led to Walton pushing his girlfriend “against a wall and punched her several times in the head and face,” according to the police report, leaving the victim with swelling on her left eye.</p>
      <blockquote>“We were made aware of a police matter earlier this morning regarding Mark Walton,” Dolphins general manager Chris Grier. “We hold our players to a high standard and take these matters very seriously. We will have no further comment at this time.”</blockquote>
      <p>Walton was already on thin ice stemming from three arrests he occured last offseason on a variety of charges, including weapons, drugs and battery.</p>
      <p>Walton received a four-game suspension in early November for a violation of the NFL’s conduct and substance abuse policies related to those arrests. The Bengals released him in April and he signed with the Dolphins in May.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old rushed for 201 yards on 53 carries in his seven games with the team.</p>
