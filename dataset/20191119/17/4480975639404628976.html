      <p>United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he will "just raise tariffs" if the US doesn't make a deal with China.</p>
      <p>"China is going to have to make a deal," Trump added, per Reuters. "We will see what happens."</p>
      <p>These comments seem to be weighing on the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment/risk-appetite">risk appetite</a>. As of writing, the 10-year US Treasury bond yield was down 1.7% on the day at 1.787% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was erasing 0.4%. Meanwhile, the JPY is capitalizing on the risk-off flows with the USD/JPY pair dropping to 108.50 area.</p>
