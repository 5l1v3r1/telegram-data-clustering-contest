      <h2>Three options of fitment likely to be suggested to government</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:18:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-Rajeev-995/" target="_blank">M. Rajeev</a></address>
      <p>The Pay Revision Commission (PRC), the first after the formation of the State, is reported to be giving final touches to its report on the pay revision of over three lakh employees in different cadres of the State government.</p>
      <p>The Commission is understood to be fine-tuning its recommendations relating to pay revision after a series of consultations with senior officials of the Finance Department for assessing the budgetary allocation made towards the cost of the employees. Senior officials said the commission was likely to suggest three options of fitment, not just one, and leave the final decision to the government.</p>
      <p>The Commission members intensified their efforts to submit the report, at least on the employees’ pay-related aspects, after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, on November 10, asked the panel to submit its report within 10 to 12 days. The PRC members, however, remained tight-lipped over the quantum of hike that was likely to be recommended in the report. “The report is complete in all respects. It is only the question of filling the blanks related to the quantum of fitment,” a senior official said.</p>
      <h3>Economic slowdown</h3>
      <p>The development assumes significance as the employees are demanding fitment of over 40%, but it appears unlikely given the slowdown in the economy that resulted in significant pruning of allocations made to different sectors. The officials said the Commission is expected to submit its report and recommendations soon, after which the government would constitute a committee of Ministers to examine the recommendations.</p>
      <p>The Ministerial Committee would hold consultations with the employees’ unions for eliciting their views on the PRC recommendations before finalising its recommendations, especially those relating to the mode of payment of arrears due from July 1, 2018. The Ministerial Committee would then submit its recommendations to the Chief Minister for his consent and the matter would be discussed at the State Cabinet meeting for its final approval.</p>
