      <p>The Reds’ Brazilians were in action on Tuesday afternoon, with two of the three in the starting lineup in a 3-0 win over South Korea.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a> kept a clean sheet in goal, but <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/fabinho-handed-rare-start-as-brazil-bring-winless-run-to-an-end/">Fabinho also earned a rare start</a> and was a driving force behind the Selecao’s win.</p>
      <p>Manager Tite was <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/brazil-fabinho-confidence-tite/1hf4oy7y2vao6167w55v2p4lys">impressed</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> has built a positive growing. All the times he played, he played very well.<br/><br/>“And he brings confidence from his club to the Brazil national squad. In a natural way, and we can feel it. It’s not that you can only see it, you can feel it.<br/><br/>“<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> is playing his normal football in a role that he also has at Liverpool.”</blockquote>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a> has <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/gini-wijnaldum-sends-firm-message-on-racism-after-incident-in-holland/">spoken forcefully on the recent incident of racism</a> in his home country, and Scotland boss Steve Clarke says he won’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andy-robertson-scotland-liverpool-injury-17279722">invoke FIFA rulings</a> after a number of players, including <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a>, pulled out of the squad this time around.</p>

      <h3>Stupid opinion of the day</h3>
      <p>Perennial moron Craig Burley has <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news-live-man-utd-20912271">spewed forth once more</a>, this time venting on ESPN that Liverpool should sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic as they have “nobody else, literally nobody else” after <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> up front.</p>
      <p>Then he goes on to talk about <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/divock-origi/">Divock Origi</a> (doesn’t count), ignores the fact both Salah and Mane both play through the middle, discounts any kind of youngster, admits Zlatan doesn’t fit the style and then says he wouldn’t ask him to “run around closing teams down” anyway.</p>
      <p>But we should still sign him, and “it would work”.</p>
      <p>Because, you know, Burley. Appoint him Marco Silva’s successor, someone.</p>
      <h3>Tweet of the day</h3>

      <h3>What we’re reading</h3>
      <p>Could Macclesfield be the next Bury? Hopefully not, but <i>The Athletic</i>‘s Simon Hughes <a href="https://theathletic.com/1374340/2019/11/19/players-wages-late-for-10-months-and-the-owner-will-only-talk-via-whatsapp-could-macclesfield-be-the-next-bury/">details why that could be the case</a>.</p>
      <p>On a lighter note, remember how fun Newcastle were under Kevin Keegan? Belgian sort-of-defender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/17/philippe-albert-newcastle-keegan-asprilla-manchester-united-interview">Philippe Albert talks all about</a> Keegan, Asprilla, that unbelievable lob over Peter Schmeichel and a whole lot more, to the <i>Guardian</i>‘s Michael Butler.</p>
      <h3>Worth watching tonight</h3>
      <p>Wales vs. Hungary is a win-and-in situation in the Euro 2020 qualifiers; Germany vs. Northern Ireland could be surprisingly even. Or an absolute landslide. Both kick off at 7:45pm.</p>
      <p>If you’re desperate for a return to domestic footy, go for Bromley vs. Bristol Rovers in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fa-cup">FA Cup</a> replay at the same time. You’d have to be pretty desperate, mind.</p>
