      <p><b>Indonesia: </b>Indonesian police arrested 43 suspected militants on Monday believed to be linked to a suicide attack last week.<br/><br/>The suicide bomber killed himself and wounded six others in a police station on Wednesday in Medan on Sumatra. The attacker has been linked to "Islamic State" (IS).<br/><br/>Two bomb-makers were also shot dead during a raid.<br/><br/>"The pair resisted arrest and tried to attack police with sharp weapons and an air gun," National Police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>He added that he believed that the suspects were a member of a local affiliate of the Islamic State group known as the Jama'ah Anshorut Daula (JAD). The arrests were made in seven provinces and included the group's leader, according to Prasetyo.<br/><br/>Police believe that they were responsible for making the bomb that was detonated by the 24-year-old attacker last week.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Increased attacks<br/><br/>Indonesia has suffered a string of terrorist attacks since 2000. More recent strikes have been blamed on Islamic State-inspired militants. Last month, the country's security minister was stabbed by an IS-linked couple.<br/><br/>JAD has been implicated in a number of the attacks over the last two years. An Indonesian court banned the network in 2017.<br/><br/>In August, authorities shot and arrested a militant who attacked officers at a station in Surabaya. In June another was seriously wounded when he tried to blow himself up outside a police building on Java island.</p>
