      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Wire star Clarke Peters speaks to Mirror Online about his role in the Harriet Tubman biopic Harriet, whilst giving some thoughts on his career past, present, and future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:20:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Harriet is a new biographical drama that tells the story of an American abolitionist icon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harriet-tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> (played by Cynthia Erivo in the film) was a woman who escaped from the bonds of slavery and led hundreds of slaves to safety across a long career as a hero of anti-slavery activism and working on the underground railroad, all while facing personal hardship and putting herself in grave danger.</p>
      <p>One of the members of the acclaimed cast of the film is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-wire">The Wire</a> star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/clarke-peters">Clarke Peters</a>, whose long acting career includes roles in shows such as Treme, Person of Interest and The Divide, and can currently be seen in BBC/HBO fantasy series <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/his-dark-materials">His Dark Materials.</a></p>
      <p>Mirror Online spoke to Peters, 67, about why he wanted to be involved in the film, how it expanded his knowledge of a period he already had an interest in, and also looks back on The Wire and forward to a much-anticipated new series.</p>
      <p>But how did the actor, whose acting career stretches back to the 1970s, get involved in the film Harriet?</p>

      <p>Clarke Peters said: "I was invited to work on the film and with Harriet’s history and story, I was just happy to be part of this conversation as it’s been long-awaited."</p>
      <p>He also spoke about how the film opened his eyes even further to understanding the story of Harriet Tubman and the abolitionist movement in America.</p>
      <p>"My knowledge of her was expanded by working on the film," describes Peters. "I didn't realise that, for example, her father had connections with abolitionist movement before. I didn't know that her father was freed and she and her family were still enslaved.</p>
      <p>"I was picking up bits and pieces of information and connecting the dots that I did know about, including Frederick Douglass.</p>
      <p>"It was a huge movement that history likes to downplay, especially in American books. It certainly expanded my knowledge [working on the film]."</p>

      <p>The veteran actor also speaks about the immense respect he feels for his character of Ben Ross, Harriet's supportive father.</p>
      <p>"I think that he’s an honest man, a god-fearing man in the sense of church and not wanting to tell a lie," explains Peters, "which is why he covers his eyes. He probably did know Frederick Douglass - looking at the timelines and the movement of people - there’s a lot going on there.</p>
      <p>"Her father, having his bought his own freedom, it takes a special mind to go through that and a special quality of man to be known for the craft of his work, which takes something in any society. I enjoyed wearing his skin for a minute."</p>
      <p>The star of His Dark Materials also gives his opinion on how accurate historical dramas should be.</p>
      <p>Peters argues: "I think they should be true to life, why would you want to tell a lie about someone’s life? I mean, there is Hollywood perhaps sensationalising.</p>
      <p>"In Harriet’s case, maybe she didn't jump off that bridge, but whether she did or she didn't, it doesn't affect the fact that she took so many enslaved people to safety before she used the underground railroads. The important facts are there. I think the remaining truth, as well as facts, is important."</p>

      <p>Looking back, however, does Peters still regularly find himself talking about a little show called The Wire?</p>
      <p>Peters answers: "Yes. Yesterday on set I’m working on something completely different and we started talking about it. I don’t think it’s something that will go away, at least for a while. And I’m okay with that, as long as it’s not "What is Snoop doing now?'"</p>
      <p>The cultural significance of the acclaimed HBO drama series isn't lost on Peters, who played Detective Lester Freamon on the hit show from 2002 to 2008.</p>
      <p>"At the time we didn't know how important it was. I didn't know how it important it was. It was real blessing to be a part of that conversation."</p>
      <p>But does he still keep in touch with his co-stars from the Wire?</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wendell-pierce">Wendell Pierce</a> is in town right now so I’ll get a chance to see him," says Peters. "Dominic [West] and I stay in contact every once in a while, Sonja [Sohn] reaches out everyone once in a while to say hello.</p>
      <p>"I, unfortunately, lost my best friend last year, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/reg-e-cathey">Reg E. Cathey</a> , who was with us for a while in the show. God bless him, he was a wonderful spirit, and I’ll miss him."</p>

      <p>Peters is currently working hard filming in Iceland on what is sure to be an epic sci-fi series for a young new streaming service.</p>
      <p>"This is an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/isaac-asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> book series that we’re serialising called Foundation that he wrote back in the fifties/early sixties, but that’s pretty much all I can say right now," teases Peters. "That’s what we’re working on now with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/apple-tv">Apple TV</a> ."</p>
      <p>But that's not all, as Peters is set for a new stage production too.</p>
      <p>"We just finished a workshop on Sammy - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sammy-davis-jr">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> - which is what I am looking forward to getting to work with once the Foundation series is over and putting it on stage with the great Giles Terera from Hamilton as Sammy Davis Jr."</p>
      <p>The veteran actor seems to show no signs of slowing down his illustrious career now!</p>
