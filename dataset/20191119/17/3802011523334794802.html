      <p>Chigando arrived at the Civil Court baying for Jowakem’s blood after discovering their love messages in Kunaka’s mobile phone.</p>
      <p>He demanded to see Jowakem’s bosses and the story became the talk of the day amongst officers and people who were being served at the place of justice.</p>

      <p>When H-Metro arrived, Jowakem was being escorted by a prison traffic officer.</p>
      <p>Chigando had no kind words about him.</p>
      <p>“Jowakem seduced my wife a month ago when she came here seeking custody of a month old child she left at our matrimonial home following a misunderstanding,” said Chigando.</p>
      <p>“He pretended to be a Good Samaritan assisting my wife to get to the relevant offices while he had an agenda of having a love affair with her.</p>

      <p>“My wife failed to resist and the two started to cheat and I only discovered it when I accessed her mobile phone.</p>
      <p>“I wanted him fired for failing to be professional that is why I decided to take my issue to his bosses.</p>
      <p>“He apologised and begged me for forgiveness but it does not help since he has already won my wife’s heart while taking advantage of our differences,” Chigando.</p>
      <p>Jowakem could neither confirm nor deny dating Kunaka referring the questions to Chigando.</p>
      <p>“I have no comment my brother over this. I cannot say we have resolved the issue and Chigando is the best person to say much about it,” said Jowakem.</p>
      <p>Kunaka could not be reached for comment and was reported to have gone to Domboshava. <a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/officer-humiliated-over-married-woman/"><b>H-Metro</b></a></p>
