      <p>One of the more interesting pieces of tech to come out of IFA 2019 this year was the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/lenovo-yoga-c640-makes-jump-arm-intels-10th-gen-cpus">Yoga C640</a>, an ultra-portable 2-in-1 that dropped the Qualcomm Snapdragon platform seen on the C630 in favor of Intel's new 10th Gen Core CPUs. After months of waiting, the Yoga C640 is now available, with prices <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Flenovo.7eer.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F218864%2F3808%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU71933YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.lenovo.com%252Fus%252Fen%252Flaptops%252Fyoga%252Fyoga-c-series%252FYoga-C640%252Fp%252F88YGC601300&amp;token=U7bnsQBQ">starting at $730</a>.</p>
      <p>Like its predecessor, the Yoga C640 is all about staying as portable as possible. Inside the Yoga C640, you have the option to select from Intel's 10th Gen Core i3, i5, and i7 processors, along with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. Lenovo previously said there would be options for 4G LTE and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) as well, but those don't appear to be available yet.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, you're looking at a 13-inch 1080p touch display and up to 20 hours of battery life. There's also a single USB-C port, along with two USB 3.1 ports. Lenovo has also thrown in a fingerprint sensor for security, along with a privacy shutter for the webcam.</p>
      <p>With the currently available models, prices start at $730 for the base configuration and go up to $1,250. You can customize your own configuration, or go with several pre-configured models.</p>
