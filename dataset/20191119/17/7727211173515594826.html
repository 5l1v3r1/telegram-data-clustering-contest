      <h2>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has been speaking about the stadium which has gotten under his skin the most</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:10:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-clarke/" target="_blank">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has revealed the stadium that he hates the most.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> has paid a huge 'compliment' to La Liga side Sevilla by explaining that he hates playing at their ground the most.</p>
      <p>The German has managed teams such as Mainz, Borussia Dortmund and now <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and has come across many difficult competitors and hostile environments.</p>
      <p>But of all the grounds that have been graced with the presence of Klopp, it's the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium out of all of them that has got under the affable manager's skin the most.</p>
      <p>Klopp told <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/liverpool-coach-klopp-reveals-the-stadium-he-hates-playing-at-most-7741979">SPORT</a> : "I don't know if it's the best stadium to play in, but the stadium I hate playing in the most is Sevilla's because of the atmosphere it has... that's a compliment!"</p>
      <p>One of the key reasons behind Klopp's hatred for Sevilla's home ground is the fact that he has never tasted victory there.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were infamously 3-0 up at Sevilla two years ago only to draw the Champions League fixture 3-3.</p>
      <p>The Reds took a 3-0 lead thanks to a brace from Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane's effort all inside the first 30 minutes, but Wissam Ben Yedder's double and an injury-time equaliser from Guido Pizarro led to an entertaining draw.</p>
      <p>It's safe to say Klopp hasn't forgotten about that night in Spain and all the other arduous moments he's endured at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium during his career.</p>
