      <h1>NHS and Brexit dominate Exeter students' thoughts in the run-up to the election</h1>
      <h2>Keith Rossiter visited the University of Exeter to find out what future generations are thinking about the December 12 election</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:38:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">Howard Lloyd</a></address>
      <p>In the last few days, election pledges ranging from free broadband to corporation tax have dominated the political landscape.</p>
      <p>All the while, the shadow of Brexit lingers over proceedings ahead of the December 12 General Election.</p>
      <p>Keith Rossiter paid a visit to the University of Exeter to find out what was really on voters' minds - especially those of students, many of whom will be voting for the first time.</p>
      <p>The Labour Party’s promise of nationwide free broadband left a group of University of Exeter students dumbfounded. The students, members of the university’s Model Westminster society, were more interested in the fate of the NHS.</p>
      <p>Both main parties have rushed out a swathe of generous spending pledges, which Alfie Calisle, a law student and Conservative supporter, thought were 'not very Tory'.</p>

      <p>Alfie argued that parts of the NHS should be privatised, because private companies were very good at making businesses run more efficiently. However, he was outnumbered by his fellow students, who said the NHS was “one of this country’s proudest institutions”.</p>
      <p>Gabriel, a politics, philosophy and economics student, said privatisation might make the NHS more efficient – at the expense of the patient.</p>
      <p>“The NHS for me encapsulates what is great about Britain," Gabriel said.</p>
      <p>The issues at stake in this election appear to have mobilised the young.</p>
      <p>Jeeves Sidhu, founder of the Model Westminster society, a non-partisan group which aims to increase political engagement among students, said a million young people have registered to vote in the past month alone.</p>
      <p>Tiah Rickey, 19, a maths with finance student, is one of those who have registered to vote for the first time. She is excited about the election 'because women fought for the right to vote'.</p>

      <p>Ben Sturt, third-year philosophy and politics student, voted in 2017 and in this year’s European Parliament elections.</p>
      <p>“We have an obligation to find out what is going on and how it affects our lives,” he said.</p>
      <p>Katherine Buckel, a third-year liberal arts student, admitted she was not politically engaged.</p>
      <p>“People are fed up with Brexit. I know people who were politically engaged but aren’t now because it’s quite an ordeal,” she said.</p>
      <p>For her, climate change is the most important issue.</p>
      <p>Sam Bowerman, 20 and in his third year of a politics, philosophy and economics degree, said students cared more about climate change than about Brexit – but the EU issue was the main influence on his vote.</p>
      <p>He supports Ben Bradshaw, who is the long-standing Labour MP for Exeter.</p>
      <p>For those confused by the issues and the way politics works, Sam Bedford recommended the website “Simple Politics” for an insight into current affairs.</p>
      <p>Saffron Langley, a 21-year-old politics and sociology student, said that although some countries make a small charge for health services, that was not feasible in Britain: “Until we sort out our huge inequlity, the NHS should be free.”</p>
      <p>On tuition fees, most of the students said they were prepared to pay something – but the present rate was too high.</p>
      <p>“It really creates a class issue, where especially working class people feel terrified of this huge debt.”</p>
      <p>Gabriel said the prospect of another £14,000 of debt made him think twice about doing a master’s degree. But Alfie said he saw it as a personal investment.</p>
      <p>The climate emergency looms large in students’ minds, but Alfie said we should be wary of demonising those who cannot afford to be more environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p>Gabriel agreed, saying: “I do think the environment is quite a middle class problem. We can afford to care, but if you’re living on the edge you have to get by.</p>
      <p>“But it’s something we have to deal with – not tomorrow, but today. Yes, we might take economic hits. And Brexit comes at the worst time for this because that’s already going to be an economic hit.</p>
      <p>“That’s one reason I might consider voting Green. I know they won’t win, but if they get a lot of votes it will push the issue higher up the agenda.”</p>
