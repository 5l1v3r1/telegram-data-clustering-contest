      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andy-ruiz-jr/">Andy Ruiz Jr</a> claims <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anthony-joshua/">Anthony Joshua</a> didn’t hurt him in their first fight and believes the defeated champion caught him with a ‘lucky shot’ in the third round.</p>
      <p>The Mexican hit the canvas in the third round after Joshua connected with an uppercut and hook, but rallied to drop his opponent and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/02/andy-ruiz-jr-shocks-world-dethroning-champion-anthony-joshua-stunning-victory-9773674/">eventually win the fight in the seventh</a>.</p>
      <p>Joshua similarly claimed he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/17/anthony-joshua-says-andy-ruiz-aint-skilful-beat-lucky-punch-10588235/">beaten by a ‘lucky punch sent by the gods’</a> and that verbal jab appears to have left its mark on Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>‘I got lazy. I think I was feeling good the first three rounds and I got a little lazy,’ Ruiz Jr told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBK4fieXn-4&amp;feature=youtu.be">Sky Sports</a> about the third round.</p>

      <p>‘He got me with an upper and a hook. I was standing up too tall for him just to get me instead of being low where I was making it difficult for him.</p>

      <p>‘For me, I think it was a lucky shot from him. I know what I did wrong. We watched the videos a hundred times. I got lazy in the third round.</p>
      <p>‘It was just a punch, in a blink of an eye and you’re on the floor. What the hell just happened? I don’t feel I got hurt, I wasn’t wobbling or nothing.</p>
      <p>‘I still had that will and fire inside of me that I wanted to keep fighting and win the fight.</p>
      <p>‘I had to do everything possible to change the fight and that’s exactly what I did with the left hook I got him with. It was a good shot and I was the better fighter that day.’</p>
      <p>Joshua and Ruiz Jr are set to ramp up their verbal sparring as their rematch is less than a month away on 7 December.</p>
