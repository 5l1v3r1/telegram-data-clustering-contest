      <p>Every year, a <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/">John Lewis</a> ad marks the beginning of the Christmas season and spreads that cozy Christmassy feeling that makes winter all the more magical. And anyone who’s watched these ads knows that it doesn’t feel like Christmas until a John Lewis ad has been released. And this year, we think they’ve created something really special.</p>
      <p>We at <b>Bright Side</b> weren’t exactly prepared for the emotional rollercoaster we’d experience while watching this year’s John Lewis ad, and we think you’re in for a real treat.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/">John Lewis &amp; Partners</a> is a chain of high-end department stores operated throughout the United Kingdom, but what they're probably most well-known for are their amazing Christmas ads. This year, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/content/christmas-advert">John Lewis collaborated with its sister brand, Waitrose &amp; Partners</a>, to tell the story of a loveable and chubby dragon, Excitable Edgar.</p>
      <p>Edgar is so excited about Christmas that he can't hold his flames together, literally. But sadly, his excitement is too overwhelming and poor Edgar dampens everyone's Christmas spirit. The people in the city were all busy preparing for their Christmas festivities, but when Edgar and his best friend Ava tried to help with the preparations, little Edgar couldn't contain his excitement and always made a mess.</p>

      <p>And just when he was on the verge of ruining Christmas, everyone turned their backs on little Edgar. Everyone except his best friend Ava, that is. And just as best friends do, Ava did the nicest thing for the excitable Edgar and showed him just how much she really cares about him.</p>
      <p>Ava helped Edgar light up Christmas in his own unique way and went on to show him that a real friend would go the extra mile to find just the right present. And it's a reminder to all of us that a thoughtful gesture can mean so much to the ones we love, especially around the holidays.</p>

      <p>This funny and heartwarming story is set to the legendary '80s tune of "<a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/cant-fight-this-feeling/385550937?i=385550981">Can't Fight This Feeling</a>" by REO Speedwagon. And just for this occasion, the song has been re-recorded by Dan Smith, the singer from the popular band, Bastille.</p>
      <p>Martin George, a partner and customer director of Waitrose &amp; Partners, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/content/christmas-advert">added a few words</a> about the production of this ad, saying, "The magic of friendship and making our loved ones feel special are some of the most wonderful things about this time of year."</p>
      <p>We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but we think that this is one of the best Christmas ads to ever have been released. Do you agree?</p>
