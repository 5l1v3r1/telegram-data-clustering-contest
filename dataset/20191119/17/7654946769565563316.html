      <h1>Antonio Brown apologizes to Robert Kraft — and gets Tom Brady’s approval</h1>

      <p>Antonio Brown has reached a new level of desperation in his quest to get back in the NFL, and he appears to have Tom Brady’s support.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the embattled wide receiver posted an apology to Patriots owner Robert Kraft on Twitter and Instagram for mocking him after the Pats cut Brown in September. Several Patriots, including Brady and Julian Edelman, liked the post on Instagram.</p>
      <p>“Mr.Kraft I apologize sincerely to you and your organization! All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama ! Thank you sincerely AB,” Brown wrote.</p>
      <p>The post included a photo of Brown hugging Brady after the two connected on a touchdown in Brown’s lone game with New England, a Week 2 win over the Dolphins. Brady <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/26/the-patriots-decision-to-cut-antonio-brown-wasnt-so-simple/">was reportedly “a million percent in”</a> when the Patriots initially signed Brown following his release from the Raiders. It came out after the signing, in the form of a civil lawsuit, that Brown’s former trainer Britney Taylor accused Brown of sexually assaulting her on three separate occasions.</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old Brown, who has exhibited erratic social-media behavior since being released by the Patriots following a second accusation of sexual assault, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/22/antonio-brown-blasts-robert-kraft-ben-roethlisberger-in-tweetstorm/">took a Twitter shot at Kraft</a> on Sept. 22 for Kraft being charged with soliciting a prostitute at a Florida massage parlor.</p>
      <p>“Kraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly,” Brown wrote in that Twitter post, which was deleted the same day.</p>
      <p>Brown has been very critical of the NFL on social media, at one point declaring he was done with the league, but he’s indicated he wants back in. On his Instagram story Monday night, he shared someone else’s post featuring Brown photoshopped in an Eagles jersey with the caption, “It’s time.”</p>
      <p>Brown is under investigation by the NFL over the sexual-assault claims and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/antonio-brown-happy-after-marathon-meeting-with-nfl-brass/">met with the league for about eight hours</a> last week.</p>
