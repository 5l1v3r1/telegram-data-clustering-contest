      <p>The Arizona Coyotes tried to troll the Los Angeles Kings by hanging a banner fans have deemed unlucky for the franchise, but the Kings clapped back.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, Los Angeles faithful complained that a banner celebrating Taylor Swift's record number of sold-out shows at the Staples Center jinxed their team. As a result, the venue agreed to cover the banner — which was first hung in 2015 — any time the Kings play home games.</p>
      <p>The Coyotes capitalized on Los Angeles' quirky Achilles' heel and hung a mock version of the banner when the Kings came to visit Monday night, but Los Angeles immediately clapped back.</p>

      <p>The Kings' social media team was alluding to Arizona's NHL franchise's lack of Stanley Cup titles and thus the Coyotes have never hung a championship banner.</p>
      <p>Still, Arizona got the last laugh. The Coyotes shut out Los Angeles 3-0 to move to 13-7-2 on the season and closer to overtaking the Edmonton Oilers for first place in the Pacific division.</p>
