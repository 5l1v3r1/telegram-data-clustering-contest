      <p>As many as 595 one-stop centres (OSCs) to offer assistance to women victims of various crimes, including sexual assaults, have become operational in the country and 2.27 lakh women have received care, the Lok Sabha was informed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said the One-Stop Centre scheme is being implemented since April 1, 2015, and it is exclusively designed to provide integrated services such as medical aid, police assistance, legal counselling, court case management, psycho-social counselling and temporary shelter to women affected by violence.</p>
      <p>"As per the available information, 728 OSCs have been approved by the government of India of which 595 OSCs are operational in the country. So far, 2.27 lakh women have been assisted by these centres," he said in a written reply.</p>
      <p>The central government has taken a number of other initiatives for prevention and speedy investigation relating to cases of sexual assault that include amendment of laws prescribing stringent penal provisions like the death penalty for rape of a girl below the age of 12 years and mandatory completion of investigation and trials within two months each, the minister said.Â </p>
