      <p>Kimberly took to her Instagram story to respond to concerned fans and explained how she almost died.</p>

      <p>‘In 48 hours we lost our baby, a boy by the way, and I almost lost my life which is not a story my husband told, but at some point, I can dig into the details of what happened in the emergency room.’</p>
      <p>Kimberly confessed she wasn’t ready to talk about everything, but will at some point.</p>

      <p>The former Dawson’s Creek star, 42, broke the news during his appearance on Dancing With the Stars.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘My wife Kimberly and I went through every expectant parent’s worst nightmare. We lost the baby.</p>
      <p>‘The little soul that we had expected to welcome into our family took a shortcut to whatever lies beyond. You never know why these things happen. It’s what I’ve been telling my kids.</p>
      <p>‘All you know is that it brings you closer together. It breaks you open. It opens up your heart. It deepens your appreciation. It makes you more human.’</p>
      <p>The star still made his appearance on the dancing show as Kimberly had encouraged him to go on despite being on the hospital bed.</p>
      <p>However, his first routine landed him and dance partner Emma Slater on the bottom two before being sent home.</p>

      <p>James also took to Instagram to explain how ‘wrecked’ and ‘devastated’ he is.</p>
      <p>He posted: ‘Wrecked. Devastated. In shock. That’s how we’re feeling right now after the soul we thought were going to welcome into our family in April… has taken a short cut to whatever lies beyond this life.</p>

      <p>‘We’ve been through this before, but never this late in the pregnancy, and never accompanied by such a scary, horrific threat to @vanderkimberly and her well-being. Grateful that she’s now recovering, but we’ve only just begun unpacking the layers of this one.’</p>
      <p>The Pose actor then went on to thank his friends, family, and fans for sending their love.</p>
      <p>They had announced they were expecting their sixth child in October, which was due to be born in April.</p>
