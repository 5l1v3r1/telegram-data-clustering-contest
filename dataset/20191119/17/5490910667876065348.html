      <p>Hatch, the maternity retailer, is collaborating with La Ligne, the sportswear company known for its stripes, to create a four-piece resort capsule collection launching today.</p>
      <p>Made for before, during and after pregnancy, the collection is comprised of three of Hatch’s cult-favorite pieces with a nod to La Ligne’s iconic stripes, as well as the Amelie Dress, an update to La Ligne’s best-selling Arielle Dress.</p>
      <p>The items retail from $168 to $395 on Hatchcollection.com. Besides the Amelie dress in blue pinstripe for $395, the items are a boyfriend shirt in blue pinstripes for $178, a pant in blue pinstripes for $168 and the Santorini maillot in navy for $218. It will be sold on hatchcollection.com.</p>
      <p>The collaboration marks Hatch’s first move into resort dressing, and La Ligne’s introduction to the maternity-wear market.</p>
      <p>The campaign will feature mom-to-be Asiah Saifullahzadeh Collins, new moms Claire Holt Djuna Bel and Sian Fujikawa and experts/doulas Danika Charity, Narelle Payne and Carson Meyer.</p>
      <p>In addition to its online business, Hatch has stores in New York and Brentwood, Calif.</p>
      <p>La Ligne was founded in 2016 by Meredith Melling, Valerie Macaulay and Molly Howard.</p>
