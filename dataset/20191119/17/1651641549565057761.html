      <p>Huawei is gearing up for its November 26 event in China where the company is going to launch Honor V30 and along with it, the company is also expected to launch Honor Watch Magic 2, leaked images of which have recently surfaced online, giving us a glimpse of what the upcoming Huawei smartwatch will look like.</p>
      <p>According to the leaked images, Honor Watch Magic 2 will have insanely thin bezels — they are thinner than that of the original Honor Watch Magic smartwatch. Another interesting change is the absence of red accents around the dial and the watch strap.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, that’s all that you can decode from the leaked images, leaving us in the dark about the specifications of the smartwatch.</p>
      <p>The upcoming smartwatch is expected to pack in all the usual fitness tracking features you’d find on a premium smartwatch. The original Honor Watch Magic watch featured a 1.2-inch AMOLED display, so we can also expect a similar, if not a better display this time around.</p>

      <p>To know more about the Honor Watch Magic 2, we’ll have to wait until the launch event, which is taking place in China on November 26.</p>
