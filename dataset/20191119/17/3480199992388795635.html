      <p>Stormzy has revealed that his second album will be called Heavy Is The Head and will contain a previously unreleased song with Ed Sheeran.</p>
      <p>In a post to his 1.3 million Twitter followers, the Brit Award-winning grime rapper, 26, also said the record would be released on December 13.</p>
      <p>Its title appears to refer his song Crown, released in June, which features the lyrics: “I tried to be grateful and count all my blessings / But heavy is the head that wears the crown.”</p>
