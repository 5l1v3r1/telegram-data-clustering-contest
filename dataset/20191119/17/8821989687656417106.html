      <h1>All the Ways Motley Crue Said They’d Never Tour Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:05:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Lifton</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/motley-crue/">Motley Crue</a>'s 2019 decision to reunite and tour again, five years after first announcing they were done, comes as a bit of a surprise. While they're hardly the first band to have a <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/farewell-tours-reunited-bands/">change of heart</a> on the subject, the manner in which they originally said goodbye leads to a question: How many times have they towed the company line regarding that topic over the years?</p>
      <p>When they announced their Final Tour in January 2014, Motley Crue <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-2014-final-tour/">arrived at the press conference</a> in a hearse, entered the room to a New Orleans jazz funeral arrangement of "Dr. Feelgood" and sat behind tombstones featuring their names. If that wasn't enough of a hint that the band was, in essence, finished, each member signed, in full view of reporters, a "<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-cessation-of-touring-contract/">Cessation of Touring Agreement</a>," a legally binding document that said Motley Crue would never tour again.</p>
      <p>In fairness, throughout it all, Motley Crue never said they were breaking up. Only a few days after that press conference, singer <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/vince-neil/">Vince Neil</a> <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-not-breaking-up/">clarified</a>, "We’re still gonna be making music. We’re still [gonna be selling] merchandise and stuff like Motley Crue things. ... Motley Crue will still be around; we’re just not gonna tour anymore. That’s really kind of it.”</p>
      <p>He went to admit that they would consider performing again if they were inducted into the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/category/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, but firmly stated that no amount of money could get them back out on the road.</p>
      <p>They also admitted there was a loophole in the contract that meant it could easily be voided if all four of them agreed to come back. A week later, bassist <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/nikki-sixx/">Nikki Sixx</a> said the agreement was really more of a safeguard against them using the Motley Crue name in their respective solo projects.</p>
      <p>"There are bands out there traveling under the same band name," Sixx <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/nikki-sixx-motley-crue-final-tour/">explained</a>. "<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/tommy-lee/">Tommy [Lee]</a> said it would be like, 'Nikki Sixx’s Motley Crue at the Troubadour' and 'Tommy Lee’s Motley Crue at the Canyon Club,' and they are all within a week of each other, you know? I can’t get into my car and drive down the road and have that be a reality. Not after everything that we’ve done. Not after everything we’ve been through."</p>
      <p>A year later, Motley Crue announced the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-final-tour/">dates for the last leg</a> of the tour. Even though they released a new single called "<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-all-bad-things/">All Bad Things</a>" to accompany it, Lee said their decision to hang it up was met with quizzical looks from all corners. “People from financial people to business people, friends, family, are going, 'Are you guys out of your fucking mind?" he <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tommy-lee-crue-retiring-comments/">said</a>. "The fucking <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/rolling-stones/">[Rolling] Stones</a> are still doing this shit. Just fucking do it less often or whatever. You're fucking idiots.'"</p>
      <p>“You can win Super Bowls," Sixx chimed in. "But in the end, you're going to be a quarterback standing on the field, and somebody's going to bust your fucking knee, and you're going to be lying in the middle of the field with 10 million people watching you while you can't get up. And that's a fact of life — but it's not going to be a fact of our life. We're going to win the Super Bowl, and we're going to fucking leave."</p>
      <p>As Sixx looked to transition from Motley Crue to devoting his full-time attention to <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/sixx-am/">Sixx:A.M.</a>, the bassist was so adamant about putting his past aside that he refused to include Crue's songs in his new band's set lists.</p>
      <p>"The people who are coming to see us are coming to see Sixx:A.M." he <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/nikki-sixx-no-more-crue-songs/">said</a>. "We don’t play Motley Crue music and we never will play Motley Crue music. The day Motley Crue plays its last show, I will never play another Motley Crue song again ... even if it’s one I wrote."</p>
      <p>It didn't take long for Sixx to<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/nikki-sixx-chevy-metal/"> go back on that promise</a>: In June 2016, Sixx:A.M. performed a <a href="https://loudwire.com/sixx-a-m-acoustic-motley-crue-live-wire/">slowed-down acoustic version of "Live Wire"</a> when they appeared on a French radio show in support of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sixx-am-album-tour-2016/"><i>Prayers for the Damned</i></a>.</p>
      <p>"I mean, the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-who/">Who</a> is cool and all but, guys, really?" Sixx <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/nikki-sixx-who-tour/">protested</a> in August 2015. "They're playing half-full places with just two guys left in the band. I get it. They're entitled to that. But it's just not for us."</p>

      <p>"<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/kiss/">Kiss</a> had five farewell tours and four reunion tours," Neil <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vince-neil-kiss-farewell-tour-comment/">pointed out</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-2000-farewell-tour/">incorrectly</a>, in the run-up to the final show. "That's exactly what we don't want to do. That was the whole reason. ... We wanted to go out on top, with people saying, 'Yeah, man, I saw the last concert. It was awesome!' We don't want to be that band, where it's [billed as] Motley Crue, and it's maybe one [original member's] brother left in the band, and they're playing clubs. ... If we let that happen, we wouldn't be thought of or remembered like we wanted to be."</p>
      <p>Not long after that, Sixx added that a band reunion "would be over my dead body. All hell would rain down on any lawyers or promoters or anyone out there who thinks they are going to go sneaking around it. Dignity is the most important thing."</p>
      <p>Even as the members got back together to oversee the movie version of their book <i><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-dirt/">The Dirt </a></i>-- which included four new songs on its <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-the-dirt-soundtrack/">soundtrack</a> -- they continued to insist that the "Cessation of Touring Agreement" would remain in effect. "We signed a contract not to tour anymore," Neil <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-new-songs-dirt-soundtrack/">said</a> in answer to fans who thought they had called it quits. "We never broke up or said we would never make music again. Hope this clears it up."</p>
      <p>But the movie nonetheless had an effect on the band. In September 2019, Sixx said their time together helped them <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-nikki-sixx-the-dirt-friendship/">rekindle their friendships</a> with one another. "I think I was just detached in a lot of ways" on the last tour, he explained. "I wasn’t detached onstage, but it just didn’t feel like a camaraderie backstage. We would do our meet-and-greets and we all would be cordial, but it just didn’t feel the same. Since the movie, it has felt like it used to in the old days. ... It’s the best feeling to at least know that we’re brothers and friends through all this. Rock ’n’ roll tears your fucking heart out sometimes. It’s hard.”</p>
      <p>Two months later, Motley Crue officially announced they were back, with a video that showed the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-blow-up-cessation-of-touring-agreement/">contract being destroyed</a> amid <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-reunion-tour-report/">reports</a> of a summer 2020 tour with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/def-leppard/">Def Leppard</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/poison/">Poison</a>. In the press release promoting the video was an admission that the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-2019-music-sales/">uptick in exposure</a>, particularly with younger listeners, due to <i>The Dirt</i> was the reason for the decision.</p>
      <p>"Its massive global success earlier this year saw Motley Crue’s popularity rush to new highs, catapulting the band’s music back to the top of the worldwide charts with the younger 18-44 demographic now representing 64 percent of the band’s fan base," the statement claimed. "Moreover, in the six months following the release of <i>The Dirt</i>, Motley Crue have celebrated a meteoric rise of almost 350 percent increase in streams of their music across all streaming platforms. However, most of the new fans have never seen any of the legendary live shows that Crueheads have relished for close to four decades."</p>

      <h4>1981-1992: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>Motley Crue played their first show on April 24, 1981, opening for Y&amp;T at Hollywood's Starwood Hotel. Thanks in part to high-profile gigs as Ozzy Osbourne's opening act and at the US Festival, the often controversial group quickly rose to the top of the hard-rock landscape. Their sophomore album, 'Shout at the Devil,' cracked the Top 20 in 1983, and three more multi-platinum efforts followed before the close of the decade. In the fall of 1991 they signed a lucrative new record contract reportedly worth as much as $35 million. But personality conflicts and a difference of opinion about the band's musical direction led to singer Vince Neil's ouster in February 1992.</p>

      <h4>1992-1996: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, John Corabi</h4>
      <p>A year after Neil made a respectable start to his solo career with the Steve Stevens-powered 'Exposed' album, Motley Crue emerged with new singer John Corabi and a heavier, more serious sound. The new lineup's self-titled 1994 LP didn't connect well with most of the band's earlier audience, though it has since obtained a cult-favorite status among fans. The accompanying tour was poorly attended, and partway through the creation of a follow-up record, Corabi -- frustrated by what he deemed a dizzying series of changing creative directions -- parted ways with the band.</p>

      <h4>1996-1999: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>With Motley Crue's commercial fortunes in free fall, and Neil's sophomore album 'Carved in Stone' failing to crack the Top 100, the original foursome decided to reunite and complete the already in-progress 'Generation Swine' record. In retrospect, they probably would have been better starting fresh, as the final result was a muddled mess of material that was ill-suited to his vocal style. The following Motley Crue vs. the Earth tour was better received, and everything seemed to be back on track.</p>

      <h4>1999-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Randy Castillo</h4>
      <p>Turns out the original lineup's second stint didn't last very long. Lee had grown eager to explore other forms of music. "I always told myself that when my heart wasn't in it, it was time to quit," he explained in the band's official autobiography 'The Dirt.' "And my heart wasn't in it." When he left to form the band Methods of Mayhem, Motley Crue replaced him with former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo, with whom they recorded 2000's back-to-basics 'New Tattoo.' A cancer diagnosis soon forced Castillo off the tour in support of the album and claimed his life in March 2002.</p>

      <h4>2000-2002: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, Samantha Maloney</h4>
      <p>With Castillo sidelined for health reasons, Motley Crue enlisted former Hole drummer Samantha Maloney to play drums on the band's 'New Tattoo' tour. "The entire band was very supportive and respectful of me. I had the time of my life!," she told NRK. "Some of the fans at first were hesitant, but I won each and every fan over every night after song one." Maloney can be seen and heard on 2001's 'Lewd, Crued &amp; Tattooed' concert video, and would go on to work with Eagles of Death Metal and Peaches.</p>

      <h4>2004-2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil</h4>
      <p>After a two-year hiatus, Motley Crue's original lineup reunited for the second time in 2004. "The only thing people ask us about is if we're getting along. Of course we get along," Lee told 'The Guardian,' addressing the band's previous public squabbles. "Time heals -- it's been six years. People change, grow up. I think we all have the attitude now that if we could just fucking get along instead of fucking with each other, we could continue to do this for as long as anybody wants to." Over the next decade, they released one more studio album (2008's 'Saints of Los Angeles'), headlined two editions of the Crue Fest festival and shared co-headlining bills with Aerosmith and Kiss before embarking on a farewell tour that concluded on New Year's Eve 2015.</p>

      <h4>June 2007: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Will Hunt</h4>
      <p>When an am injury forced Lee to miss two U.K. show on Motley Crue's 2007 summer tour, he reached out to Evanescence drummer and Crue fan Will Hunt. "I just happened to be in London for four days on a break," Hunt told MusicRadar in 2010. "Tommy called me and said, 'I need you to play tonight!'" Lee rallied enough to play "Kickstart My Heart" at one of the shows.</p>

      <h4>August 2009: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Morgan Rose</h4>
      <p>Two years later, another injury -- this time the result of playing with sparklers -- put Lee out of action for a pair of shows on the Crue Fest 2 tour. Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose was there to fill in. Eager to earn his keep, Lee hung around onstage to add backing vocals and play piano on "Home Sweet Home."</p>

      <h4>October 2015: Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Glen Sobel</h4>
      <p>A tendinitis flareup knocked Lee off the drum stool for a handful of shows on the band's farewell tour. Alice Cooper was opening the entire tour, and his powerhouse drummer Glen Sobel was there to fill in, with Lee performing his by now customary "Home Sweet Home" duties.</p>
