      <h1>Pirelli’s New Smart Tires Feature World First Technology</h1>
      <h2>Pirelli's new innovative tire tech could dramatically improve road safety.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:05:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications technology has enabled cars to communicate with infrastructure such as traffic lights and share information with other drivers. As a result, cars are becoming more connected than ever before. Taking this a stage further, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/cars-that-ride-on-bespoke-pirelli-tires">Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli</a> has created the world's first intelligent tire, dubbed the 'Cyber Tire,' that can transmit data from the road using the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/new-kia-ev-concept-features-world-s-first-in-car-5g-connection">5G network</a>.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate this smart new tech, Pirelli, Ericsson, Audi, Tim, Italdesign and KTH joined forces to show how a vehicle equipped with the sensor-fitted Pirelli Cyber Tire and connected to the 5G network was able to transmit the risk of aquaplaning detected by the tires to a following car.</p>

      <p>This was made possible thanks to 5G's ultra-high band and low latency. The demonstration took place during "The 5G Path of Vehicle-to-Everything Communication" event in Turin organized by 5GAA – Automotive Association.</p>
      <p>The Pirelli Cyber Tire is the only point of contact between the vehicle and road and is equipped with an internal sensor that can gather data from the road surface. In the future, they will also be able to tell drivers how many miles they've clocked, the dynamic load of a tire, and detect road hazards such as water or ice that could result in a loss of grip.</p>

      <p>They will also be able to work with driving assistance systems to improve safety, comfort, and performance. The same information will also be transmitted to other cars and the infrastructure to warn other road users about the road conditions.</p>
      <p>This isn't the only innovative tire tech Pirelli is developing, as the company also presented its Italia Track Adrenaline designed for track days, which includes a line of sensor-fitted P Zero Trofeo tires that monitor tire pressure and temperature in real-time and provide the driver with suggestions on how to improve their on-track performance.</p>
