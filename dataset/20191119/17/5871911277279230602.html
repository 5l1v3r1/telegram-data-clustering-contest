        <b>PPG Paints Arena | Pittsburgh, PA</b>

      <p>The Penguins welcome the Isles to Pittsburgh for the front end of a home-and-home series.</p>
      <p>But that’s only part of the news…</p>
      <p>…Though it cannot be fully claimed as attributable to the efforts of this particular publication, we also cannot deny that we have been massively supportive in seeing another championship banner be lifted by an associate of the site. Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you the <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/ram-heavy-duty-pickup-2020-truck-of-the-year/">2020 Motor Trend Truck of the Year. The 2020 Ram Heavy Duty</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, the Penguins have a chance to climb into the top-3 in the Metropolitan if they can best the Islanders this evening in Pittsburgh. They come off a weekend split that saw them fall <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/16/recap-19-the-lying-lies-dirty-secrets-of-blackwood/">2-1 in Newark</a> to the Devils before <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/17/recap-20-more-like-mike-badcock-pens-throttle-leafs-6-1-p1b1/">thrashing the Leafs 6-1</a> on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Penguins are already without Letang, Crosby, and Hornqvist. Nick Bjugstad joined the legion of the wounded and will be out “longer-term” per Mike Sullivan. Crosby will be out at least 5 more weeks. Hornqvist and Letang are progressing, but will not be on the ice tonight.</p>

      <p>The Isles continue to be tough to beat, holding a 14-3-1 record through 18 games, good for second best in the East (7 points behind Washington with 5 games in-hand).</p>
      <p>The last time these two teams faced off, the Isles actually blew a 3-0 third period lead as Bryan Rust walked it off in overtime.</p>
      <p>Youngster Matt Barzal continues to lead the Isles in scoring (9G, 8A, 17P). But the Isles also continue to do it with defense, allowing just 42 goals in 18 games (2nd in GA/GP to Arizona with 2.33). They score 3.11 per, so that gives you an idea of how good they have been on the back end considering they’re 14th in the league at posting goals on their own. It’s a proficient power play unit, clicking at the league’s 9th best conversion rate (23.5%).</p>
