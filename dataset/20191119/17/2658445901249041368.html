      <p>Candidates of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Action Alliance (AA) and All Progressives Congress (APC) in the last governorship election in Imo State – Ifeanyi Ararume, Uche Nwosu and Hope Uzodinma – have failed again in their bid to upturn the victory recorded by the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) – Emeka Ihedioha.</p>
      <p>The Court of Appeal, Abuja, in separate judgments dismissed the appeals by the trio of Ararume, Nwosu and Uzodinma on the grounds that they failed to prove their cases.</p>
      <p>The appellate court was of the view that the appellants failed to establish. their claims of corruption, malpractices, non-compliance with the electoral laws and failure to secure majority lawful votes cast at the election.</p>
      <p>In the judgments in the Ararume and Nwosu, the five-man panel of Justices was unanimous, but it was a split decision of four-to-one in the appeal by Uzodinma.</p>
      <p>The court’s five man panel, led by Justice Oyebisi Omoleye, held that they had no reason to fault the findings and conclusions of the state Electoral Tribunal, that the governor scored 273, 404 votes to emerge victorious in the March 9 governorship election in Imo State.</p>
      <p>It further held that it has no reason to depart from the findings of the tribunal that evidence adduced at the tribunal were hearsay and that the court cannot tolerate hearsay evidence in any election petition.</p>
      <p>The court proceeded to dismiss the appeals and affirmed the judgments of the tribunal which upheld INEC’s declaration of Ihedioha as the winner of the election.</p>
      <p>Nwosu, Uzodinma and Ararume had in their separate appeals asked the appellate court to void the election of Ihedioha on grounds that he did not obtain the constitutional one quarter of the votes in at least two-thirds of the 27 local government areas of the state, in line with Section 179 of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>In their various submissions by their counsel, the appellants prayed the court to set aside the decision of the tribunal and declare them winner of the March 9 governorship election or in the alternative order the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a fresh election into the office of Governor of Imo State.</p>
      <p>In their petition at the trial tribunal, the appellants had claimed that Ihedioha did not obtain the constitutional one quarter of the votes in at least two-thirds of the 27 local government areas of the state, in line with the provisions of the law.</p>

      <p>They also alleged that the election was held without substantial compliance with the Electoral Act and INEC Guidelines, among other irregularities.</p>
      <p>But in its judgment on September 21, 2019 the three-man tribunal, which sat in Abuja owing to security challenge in Imo State, held that Ihedioha was lawfully declared winner of the governorship election by INEC.</p>
      <p>The tribunal chaired by Justice Malami Dongondaji, dismissed the petitions by Ararume, Nwosu and Uzodinma’s for lacking in merit and held that they failed to prove allegations made in their petitions.</p>
      <p>It further held that the case of the petitioners was unmeritorious because they failed to call relevant witnesses and that evidence of witnesses called were based on hearsay.</p>
      <p>The tribunal rejected documents tendered by the petitioners in support of their claims on the grounds that the makers of the documents were not called as witnesses.</p>
      <p>Dissatisfied with the tribunal’s decision, the three appealed to the Court of Appeal, Abuja.</p>
      <p>In one of the appeals, Ararume urged the appellate court to upturn the decision of the tribunal on the grounds that the lower court erred in law when it arrived at the decision that his case and that of his party lacked merit and accordingly dismissed it.</p>
