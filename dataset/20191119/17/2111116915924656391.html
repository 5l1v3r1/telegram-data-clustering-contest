      <p>This year's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/currys-black-friday-deals-2019-what-to-expect-this-year">Currys Black Friday deals</a> have started early, with a huge £220 knocked off the price of this 4.8-litre KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer – the same model used in the Great British Bake Off tent.</p>
      <p>For a limited time, this powerful mixer is down from £499 to just £279. It comes with three attachments for whisking, kneading and mixing (just push and twist to change them) and 10 speed settings to suit different recipes. </p>
      <p>It's perfect for cake, bread, meringue, pastry and much more, and once your creations are in the oven, you can simply pop the bowl and attachments in the dishwasher.</p>
