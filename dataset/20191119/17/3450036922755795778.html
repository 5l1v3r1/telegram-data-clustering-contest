      <p>KIRKSVILLE, Mo. â€” The holidays are fast approaching, and one northeast Missouri physician is offering tips to stay healthy through all the hustle and bustle.</p>
      <p>Dr. Justin Puckett, of Complete Family Medicine, says the holiday season can take a toll on our immune system.</p>
      <p>He adds that while it's important all the time, covering sneezes and coughs is especially important this time of year, due to being around an increased number of people.</p>
      <p>He says that those everyday good habits can sometimes be forgotten, resulting in illnesses being spread at a faster rate.</p>
      <p>Puckett explains that if you are ill, you should stay home instead of sharing germs with others, no matter how fun the holiday event may be.</p>
      <blockquote>"If somebody has a fever or has been actively sick, then you just need to stay home no matter how much you want to be at that gathering -- it's just not the right thing to do to carry those germs."</blockquote>
      <p>If out shopping prior to the holidays, Puckett also stresses the importance of sanitizing shopping carts and baskets before touching them.</p>
      <p>He adds that you should also wash your hands frequently.</p>
