      <p>During the encore, White and co. welcomed Casablancas to the stage as they launched into ‘Is This It’ highlight ‘The Modern Age’. Towards the end of the energetic performance, The Strokes’ frontman clambered up onto a speaker stack before bowing down to fellow indie icon White. After the song ended, the singer quickly departed the stage to rapturous applause.</p>
      <p>The Raconteurs posted a series of images of the performance on their official Instagram account following the show. See those below.</p>
