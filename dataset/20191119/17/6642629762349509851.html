      <p>Reclusive <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkmenistan.html">Turkmenistan</a> staged its first foreign opera on Tuesday, nearly 19 years after the Central Asian country's founding president banned the art form as "incompatible with Turkmen mentality".</p>
      <p>The capital Ashgabat's state theatre was packed out by residents of the city of a million to see 19th-century Italian composer Ruggero Leoncavallo's famous opera, "Pagliacci" (Clowns) as part of an "international culture festival".</p>

      <p>Spectators arriving at the country's main theatre on Tuesday evening voiced a yearning for the long-taboo art form and hurried to take their seats.</p>
      <p>Anna Krasnova, 59, said she was "thrilled" opera had returned to the isolated former Soviet republic.</p>
      <p>"For nearly two decades, we have been missing a whole layer of culture. I have waited such a long time for this day," Krasnova told AFP news agency as she entered the theatre.</p>
      <p>The director of the joint Turkmen-Italian performance, Daniele de Plano, told AFP during an interview that Pagliacci was being shown as part of a "cultural exchange programme" between Italy and Turkmenistan.</p>
      <p>He said he felt "honoured to be the first director to bring back opera" to Muslim-majority Turkmenistan.</p>
      <p>"I really hope this is the beginning of a new path of ties becoming closer between Turkmenistan and opera, particularly Italian opera," said de Plano.</p>
      <p>Gas-rich Turkmenistan's erratic first leader Sapurmurat Niyazov banned opera as well as foreign ballet in 2001 in what he posited was a move to protect Turkmen culture.</p>
      <p>The ban on art forms closely associated with Soviet and Russian imperial rule continued under the second president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who came to power after Niyazov's death in 2006.</p>
      <p>There is no sign so far that ballet will be reintroduced.</p>
      <p>Strongman Berdymukhamedov has maintained many of the repressive policies of his late predecessor, whom he once served as a personal dentist.</p>
      <p>Both men are honoured by golden statues in Ashgabat, testifying to leadership cults that draw regular comparisons with North Korea.</p>
