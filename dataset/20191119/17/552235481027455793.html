      <p>A road traffic collision has led to rush-hour delays for commuters on the A77 in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Ayrshire</a> tonight.</p>
      <p>Motorists heading southbound face being held up on the approach to the Bellfield Interchange at Kilmarnock.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/trafficscotland">Traffic Scotland</a> reports that one of the lanes is blocked with traffic "very slow" on the approach to the busy interchange.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/trafficscotland">tweet</a> issued by the organisation a few minutes later confirmed that all lanes were restricted for up to 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock Standard</a> will update you on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kilmarnock.standard/">Facebook page</a> as more is learned about the incident.</p>
