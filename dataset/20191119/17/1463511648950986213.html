      <p>Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, on Tuesday congratulated David Lyon, the Governor-elect of Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>Amaechi told News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja that the victory was a testimony of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administrative transformations.</p>
      <p>He lauded the APC-led Federal Government for genuinely working to alleviate poverty and tackle litany of economic challenges confronting the nation, which according to him, is yielding results.</p>
      <p>The minister, who is also an APC chieftain in the South-South, described the victory as the beginning of APC’s future glories in the geopolitical zone.</p>
      <p>“We thank God and congratulations to all the victors,’’ Amaechi said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the APC gubernatorial candidate, David Lyon, won in six of the state’s eight local government areas.</p>
      <p>He defeated his closest rival, Senator Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party, who captured only two local governments.</p>
      <p>The Chief Returning Officer, Prof. Faraday Orumwense, declared Lyon winner, having polled 352,552 votes to defeat Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>The six local government areas won by the APC are Brass, Nembe, Ogbia, Southern Ijaw, Ekeremor and Yenagoa while the PDP won in the Sagbama and Kolokuma/Opokuma local government areas.</p>
