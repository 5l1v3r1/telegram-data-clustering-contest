      <h1>I'm a Celebrity fans baffled by 'Donald Trump' appearing on Nadine Coyle's kneecap</h1>
      <h2>"Why has Nadine got Donald Trump on her knee???"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:18:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Millward</a></address>
      <p>Fans have been left baffled after they spotted Donald Trump's likeness on the body of one <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celeb</a> contestants.</p>
      <p>Nadine, 34, has been fortunate enough to begin her life in the jungle in the Main Camp after winning the first challenge with radio presenter Adele Roberts, 40.</p>
      <p>However, prior to the former Girls Aloud singer skydiving into the wilderness below, viewers of the ITV reality show made a comparison of President Donald Trump, 73, to one of her body parts.</p>
      <p>During the launch show, the pop star joined the likes of sports pundit Ian Wright, 56, Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway, 52, X Factor winner Myles Stephenson, 28, and former England rugby player James Haskell, 34, on a lavish yacht.</p>
      <p>Whilst they were getting to know one another before having to swim to dry land, fans believed they saw Donald Trump, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1206456/Nadine-Coyle-Im-A-Celebrity-2019-Donald-Trump-knees-viewer-reaction-ITV-video">Express.co.uk </a>reports.</p>

      <p>The US President didn’t make a physical appearance however, his face was seen in Nadine’s knee.</p>
      <p>Referencing the moment on I’m A Celebrity Extra Camp last night, host Joel Dommett, 34, revealed the bizarre viewer reaction on social media.</p>
      <p>An image was shown on screen of Nadine on the yacht in a navy blazer, wearing a leopard print top and frayed denim shorts underneath.</p>
      <p>This meant her knees were on show and the crease seen made viewers compare the body part to the face of the US president.</p>
      <p>One viewer posted on Twitter: “Why has Nadine got Donald Trump on her knee??? #ImACeleb.”</p>
      <p>Another added: “Why does Nadine have Donald Trump’s face on her knee?” but it wasn’t just his face viewers thought they saw.</p>
      <p>A third wrote: “Nadine Coyle's knee cap be looking like my first born #ImACelebrityGetMeOutOfHere #ImACeleb.”</p>
      <p>Whilst a fourth commented: “Someone tell me why Nadine has a baby face as a knee #ImACeleb.”</p>
      <p>Joel also joked at the bizarre reaction as he quipped: “She has Donald Trump in her knee – the likeness is uncanny.”</p>
      <p>Nadine was left in tears during the first challenge of the series on Sunday as she despaired over taking to the skies and jumping out of a plane.</p>
      <p>Despite her fears, the Derry native managed to battle through with the support of her competitor Caitlyn Jenner, 70.</p>
      <p>Although she was offering some comfort, the gesture of friendship didn’t seem to work in the American reality star’s favour as she and James ended up in Snake Rock on rations.</p>
      <p>The former Olympian was un-phased by the jungle critters in the task and it seems her show of strength has gained huge support from viewers.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>At 7-2, she stands as the hot favourite to win the series next month according to latest odds from thepools.com bookmakers.</p>
      <p>Nadine on the other hand doesn’t seem to have the same luck as she is falling behind some of the other stars.</p>
      <p>Following her angst over entering the Australian jungle, her chances of becoming jungle queen stand at 16-1, but Adele is the least likely to win at 66/1.</p>
      <p>However, there are still some days before the public vote opens, so can Nadine improve her standing?</p>
      <p>Tonight, the two camps will reunite after days apart so will she be able to stand out among the big personalities?</p>
