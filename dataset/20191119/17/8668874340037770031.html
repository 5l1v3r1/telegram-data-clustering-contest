      <h1>The broken leg heroics of Leicester's Sam Aspland-Robinson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:45:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>Leicester Tigers winger <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/sam-aspland-robinson/">Sam Aspland-Robinson</a> is set to miss six months after he broke his leg against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/pau">Pau</a> in the Challenge Cup on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was making just his second appearance of the season after suffering a foot injury in the opening game, but he only managed seven minutes at Welford Road before he fractured his tibia.</p>
      <p>This is tough news for both the Tigers and Aspland-Robinson, but he at least received the plaudits of his team-mates in the process.</p>
      <p>England and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> prop <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/ellis-genge/">Ellis Genge</a> described Aspland-Robinson as a “soldier” on Twitter as he hobbled back into the defensive line following the injury.</p>
      <p>This will be little consolation to the player, but acts like this certainly earn the respect of the rugby world.</p>

      <p>In his brief career so far, Aspland-Robinson has been ravaged by injury as he also missed an entire year of rugby while at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p>However, he may still play a part in the latter stages of Leicester’s season if his recovery goes to plan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/jonah-holmes-scores-four-tries-as-leicester-cruise-past-pau/">Geordan Murphy’s side overcame Pau 41-20</a> and the club at least now have their returning World Cup stars back available.</p>
