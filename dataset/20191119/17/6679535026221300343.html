      <p>District Collector S.A. Raman on Tuesday inspected the survey works being carried out for Mettur surplus water scheme at M.Kalipatti Lake at Mecheri.</p>
      <p>Officials from the Water Resources Department of PWD have started the preliminary survey for the scheme through which the surplus water released from Mettur dam would be used to fill up 100 lakes in the district. During his recent visit to Salem, Chief Minister Edappadi.K.Palaniswami said that the project would be implemented at an estimated cost of ₹615 crore and foundation for the project would be laid by March-April.</p>
      <p>According to officials, 100 lakes in Edappadi, Omalur, Sankagiri and Mettur would be filled up with excess water released during rainy season from the dam. Of the 100, 12 lakes are under PWD and 88 under Panchayat Unions.</p>
      <p>The surplus water would be taken through lift irrigation to two lakes, M. Kallipatti in Mecheri and Nangavelli lakes and from there the water would be taken to other lakes. According to officials, water would be drawn through lift irrigation at Thippampatti, located on the left bank of the water spread area of the dam and it would be taken to M. Kallipatti and Nangavelli lakes via canals. According to officials, currently, survey works are being carried out to take the water to 67 lakes from M.Kallipatti and to 33 lakes from Nangavelli.</p>
      <p>Mr. Raman said that the survey works would be completed in 20 days. A release said that 4,238 acres of land would benefit through this scheme. District Revenue Officer R. Dhivakar, V. Gowthaman, Executive Engineer of Sarbanga division and other senior officials were present.</p>
