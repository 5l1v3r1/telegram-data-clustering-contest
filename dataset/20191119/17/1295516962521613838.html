      <h1>Elizabeth Banks: Captain Marvel Owes Success to Coming From a 'Male Genre'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:11:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Renaldo Matadeen</a></address>
      <p>Elizabeth Banks, director of the new <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/charlies-angels/">Charlie's Angels</a></i> reboot, has touted the success of <i>Captain Marvel</i> up to the groundbreaking Marvel Studios film coming from a male-oriented genre.</p>
      <p>Fans and critics have been less than receptive to her movie about the female spies. Banks believes that, while films such as <i>Wonder Woman</i> and <i>Captain Marvel</i> were labeled statements of feminism, their success came from the fact that they were comic book and superhero movies, which is a male-driven segment of the entertainment industry. <i>Charlie's Angels, </i>on the other hand<i>, </i>did not have that advantage.</p>

      <p>"They'll [fans] go and see a comic book movie with Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel because that's a male genre," Banks said to Australia's <i><a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=HSWEB_WRE170_a&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldsun.com.au%2Fentertainment%2Felizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-needs-to-be-a-box-office-smash%2Fnews-story%2F6734bbb011c524237b8bd58b54108531&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium">Herald Sun</a></i>. "So even though those are movies about women, they put them in the context of feeding the larger comic book world, so it's all about, yes, you're watching a Wonder Woman movie but we're setting up three other characters or we're setting up <i>Justice League</i>."</p>
      <p>Banks did attempt to pad her statements by wishing superhero films success. "By the way, I'm happy for those characters to have box office success," she said, "but we need more women's voices supported with money because that's the power. The power is in the money."</p>
      <p>Banks, who also produced, starred in and co-wrote the screenplay for this film, previously defended her reboot by pointing to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/elizabeth-banks-defends-charlies-angels/">the multitude of Spider-Man</a> films over the decades.</p>
      <p>Despite her seemingly best intentions, her comments probably won't do her reboot any favors. It's currently sitting at a score of 59% on Rotten Tomatoes, having opened below expectations with $8.6 million domestically and $19.3 million overseas. Though the movie was relatively modestly budgeted at $48 million, it fell well short of the $40.1 million debut of <i>Charlie’s</i> <i>Angels</i> (2000)<i> </i>and the $37.6 million opening for its 2003 sequel.</p>
