      <h1>'The Confession Killer' From Netflix Explores the Legacy of Henry Lee Lucas</h1>
      <h2>He admitted to over 800 murders.</h2>

      <p>Following the release of <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/netflix-original-the-devil-next-door-documentary-movie-trailer">The Devil Next Door</a>, </i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/netflix">Netflix</a> has now released a trailer for another crime <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/documentaries">docuseries</a>, this time exploring the infamous legacy of Henry Lee Lucas — a serial killer who confessed to 600 murders in the early ’80s. Although his confessions brought closure to many families and several unsolved cases, <i>The Confession Killer</i> will touch on several suspicious facts about the case, and how Lucas’ claims may have a few holes.</p>
      <p>According to Netflix, “even with no direct evidence linking Lucas to the crime scenes, he stunned authorities with his ability to sketch victims’ portraits while citing brutal details of each attack.” The upcoming Robert Kenner-directed five-part docuseries will explore how the man once referred to as America’s most prolific serial killer, may have really just been a complex figure entangled in a flawed justice system.</p>
      <p>Check out the trailer above, and catch <i>The Confession Killer</i> on Netflix December 6.</p>
