      <p>Technology accessory maker <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Satechi">Satechi</a> has released the Type-C Stand and Hub for the 2018 <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Mac+mini">Mac mini</a>. It's a slimline hub that brings a series of ports to the front of the 2018 Mac mini, while also raising the computer off the desk.<br/><br/>Both sized and colored to look part of the Mac mini, the Satechi hub brings a micro/SD card reader to the Mac mini for the first time.<br/><br/>The hub is connected at the rear of the Mac mini by a built-in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/USB-C">USB-C</a> cable that plugs into a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Thunderbolt+3">Thunderbolt 3</a> port. <br/><br/>Via that connection, it replicates some of the Mac's rear connectors and presents them in a more convenient location at the front of the machine.<br/><br/>So without reaching around or moving the Mac mini, users have quick access to a single USB-C port, three USB 3.0 ports, the micro/SD card reader, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
