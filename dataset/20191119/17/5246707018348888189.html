      <p>Airship Syndicate and THQ Nordic have just released a new trailer for the upcoming <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/darksiders_genesis">Darksiders Genesis</a></b> which shows off the game's innovative new "Creature Core" system.</p>
      <p>This feature allows players to upgrade their character's battle skills by collecting the titular cores after killing enemies and end-of-level bosses. These skills range from increased power to monster allies which appear during combat; you can also use them to trigger boons such as health and ammo drops from fallen foes. Cores can also be purchased at an in-game store in exchange for souls. The intention of the Creature Core system is to allow you, the player, to tailor the game's two lead characters – WAR and STRIFE – to your own playstyle.</p>
      <p>Darksiders Genesis launches on PC and Google Stadia on December 5th, 2019, with the console editions – including Switch – coming next year, on Valentine’s Day.</p>
