      <p>It’s not everyday that we come across such kindhearted officers of the law.</p>
      <p>Recently, a Thai policeman made headlines after going viral when he caught a teenager speeding on a motorbike without a license plate. But instead of arresting him, the officer bought the rebel teen a birthday cake instead!</p>

      <p>The officer, who is also known as Kanokpan Putthapong, explained:</p>
      <p>“I was on duty. This motorcycle was driving over the speed limit with NO helmet or license plate so I decided to arrest him.”</p>
      <p>However, the motorcyclist unexpectedly burst into tears! The concerned officer felt compelled to ask him what was going on.</p>
      <p>The troubled teen then shared that he had just left his brother’s condominium in a rage because it was his birthday and none of his family members seemed to care about it.</p>

      <p>Upon sensing the boy’s distress, Mr.Putthapong gently told him to sit and calm down before going back home. The gracious officer then headed to the nearest 7-11 to buy the neglected teen a cake with lighted candles.</p>
      <p>He presented the gift to the surprised boy and soothed the teen before letting him off with a warning. The teenager was so moved by the officer’s act, he cried again. But this time, they were tears of joy. <i>Aww! </i></p>
      <p>The policeman originally posted a photo of him and the boy on his Facebook with the caption, “Happy birthday, bro. This year, the police will buy you a birthday cake.”</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the post has since been removed, but that didn’t stop netizens from praising the kind officer for his kindness!</p>
      <p>May we all learn from this officer and spread a little kindness everywhere we go!</p>
