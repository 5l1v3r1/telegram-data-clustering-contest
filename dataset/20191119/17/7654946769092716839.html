      <h1>Teacher busted in revenge porn case involving ex’s relatives</h1>

      <p>An Indiana high school teacher was busted for sending nude snaps of his ex to the woman’s family, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Jason C. Hohlt, who also coaches the boys’ and girls’ golf teams at Pike High School in Indianapolis, was busted Monday in a revenge porn probe that began when his ex told police he continued to harass her after she blocked his number last summer, according to a probable cause affidavit <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/19/pike-high-school-teacher-coach-charged-revenge-porn-case/4236773002/">obtained by the Indianapolis Star</a>.</p>
      <p>Hohlt — who allegedly called the woman from other numbers and reached out to her relatives on social media — then took his ongoing torment to another level in July by sending nude images of his onetime companion to her brother via Facebook, the affidavit states.</p>
      <p>Hohlt’s ex-girlfriend gave screenshots of the messages and images to investigators, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim they can prove with a warrant issued by a judge to Facebook that the messages were sent from an account linked to Hohlt’s phone number, the affidavit states.</p>
      <p>An attorney for Hohlt, Chris Eskew, declined to comment when reached Tuesday by The Post.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old social studies teacher was placed on administrative leave following his arrest on a misdemeanor charge of distribution of an intimate image, <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/pike-township-teacher-on-leave-charged-in-revenge-porn-investigation/">WISH reports</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s “no reason to believe” that any students were impacted by Hohlt’s alleged behavior, Metropolitan School District of Pike Township officials said in a statement to the station.</p>
