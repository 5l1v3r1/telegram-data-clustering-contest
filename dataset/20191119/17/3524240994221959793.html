      <p>Belgium captain Eden Hazard on Monday said the 2018 World Cup bronze medallists are “stronger” than they were a year ago and have developed a “winning mentality”.</p>
      <p>Roberto Martinez’s side host Cyprus in their final Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday, having already booked their place at next year’s finals and secured top spot in Group I.</p>
      <p>“We have two more years of experience, two more years with the coach,” said Real Madrid’s Hazard, who scored twice in Saturday’s 4-1 win over Russia.</p>
      <p>“We know each other better, we have young players… I think we are stronger.</p>
      <p>“It’s even more with the question of mentality that I think we’ve evolved. We’ve started to have the winning mentality that we didn’t have enough at Euro 2016 or the World Cup.”</p>
      <p>Belgium, the world’s number one-ranked side, were stunned by Wales in the Euro 2016 quarter-finals and lost to France in the World Cup semis in Russia.</p>
