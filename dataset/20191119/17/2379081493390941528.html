      <h1>Renault could pull out of markets, products in strategy review - interim CEO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:47:18+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:47</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>PARIS — Renault has not ruled out withdrawing from some products or markets as part of a review of its mid-term goals, the carmaker’s interim chief executive Clotilde Delbos said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The strategic review is expected to be completed within a few months, and investors are hoping that will allow Renault to turn a page on months of uncertainty after the arrest last year of Renault-Nissan alliance boss Carlos Ghosn.</p>
      <p>“We will avoid it if we can … but we have to ask ourselves the question … can we just keep up the same strategy? I don’t think so. The market is changing, we have to adapt,” Delbos said at a conference.</p>
      <p>Delbos added that she was sure it was possible to make the carmaker’s alliance with Nissan a lot more efficient that it was at the moment.</p>
      <p>Renault is expected to refocus its operations, as it and Nissan, like many peers, are struggling with falling sales in a faltering global auto market.</p>
      <p>Financial chief Delbos was propelled into her current job on a temporary basis after CEO Thierry Bollore’s ousting in mid-October.</p>
      <p>Delbos has applied to take the job on a permanent basis, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.</p>
      <p>When asked on Tuesday if she wanted to be permanent CEO, Delbos declined to comment. (Reporting by Sarah White, Writing by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Edmund Blair and Jan Harvey)</p>
