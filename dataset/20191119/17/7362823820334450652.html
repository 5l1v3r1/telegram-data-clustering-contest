      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> abruptly released running back Mark Walton on Tuesday after he had reportedly been involved in an incident with his pregnant girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Walton allegedly beat his pregnant girlfriend Tuesday morning days after learning he was the father of her unborn child, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article237532529.html">Miami Herald</a> reported, citing a Davie police report.</p>

      <p>It was the running back’s fourth arrest this year.</p>
      <p>“We were made aware of a police matter earlier this morning regarding Mark Walton,” Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said in a statement. “We hold our players to a high standard and take these matters very seriously. We will have no further comment at this time.”</p>
      <p>According to the Miami Herald, police said Walton and the woman got into an argument and he allegedly pushed her "against a wall and punched her several times in the head and face.” The attack reportedly left the victim with a swollen left eye.</p>
      <p>The woman was reportedly five weeks pregnant and told Walton about the pregnancy Sunday.</p>

      <p>Walton was reportedly arrested and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant person.</p>
      <p>Miami signed the 22-year-old in May after the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cincinnati-bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> released him over a series of arrests. The team’s announcement came as he was serving a four-game suspension for violating NFL conduct and substance abuse policy following the arrests last offseason.</p>
      <p>A Florida court sentenced Walton in August to six months’ probation after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor weapons charge. Other charges, including marijuana possession and reckless driving, were dismissed. He had been eligible to return to the field Dec. 2.</p>
      <p>Walton pleaded guilty to resisting arrest and reckless driving in March. He had a misdemeanor marijuana charge in that arrest dismissed. As part of the March plea deal, he had a drug charge from a January arrest and a battery charge from a February arrest dismissed, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28114827/mark-walton-cut-dolphins-rb-allegedly-struck-pregnant-woman">ESPN</a>.</p>
