      <h1>Drunk teen held weapon to worker's throat in takeaway rampage</h1>
      <h2>Elise Shallis, who spat at one worker and allegedly called him a "dirty f***ing p***", walked free from court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:28:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/charlotte-hadfield/" target="_blank">Charlotte Hadfield</a></address>
      <p>A teenage girl threatened to stab a staff member in a vile rampage at an Indian takeaway on Lark Lane.</p>
      <p>Elise Shallis became aggressive with staff at Shah's Balti House, after she was told she couldn't use the toilet.</p>
      <p>Shallis, who was just 16 at the time of the offence, walked free from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/courts">Liverpool Crown Court</a> today with a community order, including 100 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/courts">The court heard</a> how Shallis, of Stephens Close, Stalybridge, walked into the takeaway on Lark Lane at around 11.45pm on April 20, 2018, and tried to go down a corridor to use the toilet.</p>
      <p>Mike Stephenson, prosecuting, said when staff inside the takeaway prevented Elise from using the toilet she became aggressive.</p>
      <p>Shallis, who is now 18, reached into her pocket and produced a spanner and held this to staff member Kaiesh Ali's throat.</p>

      <p>Mike Stephenson, prosecuting, told the court how Shallis indicated that she had a knife and that she would stab Kaiesh Ali "who was genuinely afraid at that point."</p>
      <p>He said: "His father pulled her arm away and she told him that 'the place stinks, you all stink.'"</p>
      <p>The court heard how Shallis spat at Kaiesh Ali as she left the premises, before she returned and began acting aggressively outside.</p>
      <p>Shallis kicked the glass outside the takeaway and caused Â£65 worth of damage to the door.</p>
      <p>The police were called and Shallis was asked by officers to drop the weapon on the floor.</p>
      <p>Shallis was detained with some difficulty by police and taken to a police station for questioning.</p>
      <p>In a statement on May 9, 2019, Kaiesh Ali said Shallis had described himself and the other staff members that night, as "dirty f***ing p****."</p>
      <p>Mike Stephenson, prosecuting said when interviewed by police, Shallis said she had been drinking all types of alcohol that night and that she had become upset when she wasn't allowed to use the toilet.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Stephenson, prosecuting, said Shallis had accepted that she had told Mr Ali that she was going to stab him and had held a weapon to his throat.</p>
      <p>Only the point of the weapon was visible but Mr Ali believed it was a knife.</p>
      <p>During police questioning, Mike Stephenson, said Shallis did not explicitly accept that she had used any racist language.</p>

      <p>Since the incident, Mike Stephenson told the court how Shallis has gone on to commit a number of other offences including criminal damage in February this year and a separate offence for carrying a kitchen knife in the street on August 1, 2018.</p>
      <p>David Polglase, defence, asked that if the judge chose to give Shallis a curfew, that this was made to both her father's address and her mother's address so that she did not breach the conditions of this.</p>
      <p>Judge Menary QC, said that he hopes Shallis learns that if she continues to behave like this it is only going to cause more damage to her and others.</p>
      <p>Judge Menary QC handed Shallis a community order for a 12 month period, including 100 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Shallis was also given a 15 day rehabilitation requirement and must stick to a curfew for two months between the hours of 8pm and 6am.</p>
