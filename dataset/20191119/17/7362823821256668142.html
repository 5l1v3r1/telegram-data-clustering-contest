      <h1>Trump brands impeachment inquiry a 'coup' as House holds third day of public hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:33:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Dorman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> branded <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">House Democrats'</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> a "coup" and "charade" in an apparent rebuke of the way they were handling a public hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday.</p>
      <p>His attack came hours into a contentious House Intelligence Committee hearing where administration officials testified about Trump's now-infamous phone call with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine</a> in July.</p>
      <p>In a video posted to Twitter, the Trump campaign indicated the committee's chairman, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/adam-schiff">Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,</a> led a coup that Democrats plotted after his election in 2016.</p>
      <p>"This impeachment is a charade," a narrator said alongside a video of Schiff. It pointed to a tweet from Mark Zaid -- the lawyer for the whistleblower who reported that call -- in which he claimed that a "coup has started."</p>
      <p>"That's right. The whistleblower's own lawyer wrote that the coup has started and that impeachment will follow," the narrator said. "They promised a coup and now they're trying to carry it out. The Democrats are trying to overthrow President Trump, undo the 2016 election, and silence our voices. Don't let them."</p>

      <p>The video echoed the administration's previous criticisms and touched on a concern raised about Zaid's impartiality.</p>
      <p>The campaign video was referring to a 2017 tweet in which Zaid responded to Trump's criticism of Sally Yates, a former DOJ official whom the president accused of betraying her department after she famously told employees not to defend the president's travel ban.</p>

      <p>Zaid also tweeted predictions that Trump would face impeachment. "Johnson (1868), Nixon (1973), Clinton (1998) impeachment hearings. Next up <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> (2017)," he said in a 2017 tweet.</p>
      <p>“Those tweets were reflective and repeated the sentiments of millions of people," Zaid <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/coup-has-started-whistleblowers-attorney-said-in-2017-posts-calling-for-impeachment">told Fox News</a> in November. "I was referring to a completely lawful process of what President Trump would likely face as a result of stepping over the line, and that particularly whatever would happen would come about as a result of lawyers. The coup comment referred to those working inside the Administration who were already, just a week into office, standing up to him to enforce recognized rules of law.“</p>
