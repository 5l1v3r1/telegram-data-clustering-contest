      <p>The new Chevrolet Corvette Stingray, powered by engines from General Motors' Town of Tonawanda plant, was named <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-corvette-c8-2020-car-of-the-year/">MotorTrend's 2020 Car of the Year.</a></p>
      <p>GM Tonawanda is making small volumes of the 6.2-liter, small block V-8 engines for test vehicles of the new Corvette. Full-scale engine production is expected to begin in early 2020, when a GM assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky., starts producing the vehicles.</p>
      <p>"Our Tonawanda team is proud to build these groundbreaking engines," said Ram Ramanujam, the Tonawanda plant director. "Making automotive history is an outcome of our commitment to build the worldâ€™s best engines for our customers."</p>
      <p>The Corvette won MotorTrend Car of the Year in 1984 and 1998. The redesigned Corvette was unveiled with fanfare earlier this year, including an event at the Tonawanda plant featuring GM president Mark Reuss.</p>
