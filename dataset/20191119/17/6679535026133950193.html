      <h1>Bhatti demands CBI inquiry into govt.’s claim</h1>

      <p>Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka asked Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to reveal if he has any evidence of opposition parties trying to dethrone his government as submitted to the High Court.</p>
      <p>“He seems to be confident about the evidence that he has going by the affidavit submitted to the High Court and this is a serious issue that needs to be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” he said at a press conference here on Tuesday. He said the employees’ union associated with the TRS party too was participating in the strike and there was a doubt whether some ruling party leaders too were behind the agitation.</p>
      <p>Criticising the Chief Minister for refusing to hold talks with the RTC employees despite the Court suggestion to end the impasse, he said such an attitude may result in a Constitutional crisis. Mr. Rao was not behaving like a Chief Minister and his ‘arrogance of power’ reflected in the way he ignored even the High Court’s suggestion to constitute a committee of retired judges of the Supreme Court to resolve the issue, he alleged.</p>
      <p>The Congress party would approach the Governor and the President of India seeking their intervention, he said. He blamed Mr. Rao’s comments on self dismissal of employees for the suicides of RTC employees.</p>
      <p>Manthani MLA D. Sreedhar Babu demanded that the government immediately pay two months’ salary of the striking employees than blaming the opposition. He said thousands of families were suffering due to non-payment of salary.</p>
