      <h3>Samsung’s $202 Galaxy Tab A with a $50 Amazon gift card</h3>
      <p>Amazon is offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/19/galaxy-tab-a-gift-card-bundle/">Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1-inch 32GB for <b>$202</b></a> with a bundled <b>$50</b> Amazon gift card. This is a $280 value and is one of the best deals we’ve tracked, all-time. The Galaxy Tab A is great for watching movies and TV shows while on-the-go this holiday season. Though it only has 32GB of built-in storage, Samsung gives you a microSD slot to expand it <a href="https://amzn.to/2pBNXQq">up to 512GB</a> for offline movie viewing.</p>
      <h3>Ring Doorbell 2 drops to $119</h3>
      <p>Rakuten is offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/19/smart-doorbell/">Ring Video Doorbell 2 for <b>$119</b></a>. That’s $80 off the going rate found at retailers like <a href="https://amzn.to/2IyPM5u">Amazon</a> and is within a mere $8 of the lowest price we have tracked. When I went smart doorbell shopping a couple years back, this offering was what I settled on. It hasn’t let me down and my favorite feature has to be that it’s battery-powered. This ensured that I could place it wherever I wanted, unlike wired alternatives.</p>
