      <p>This is the moment a geyser of water erupted from a hole in the ground in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> .</p>
      <p>Images and video footage, which were posted online, show water shooting high into the air in Llanllienwen Road in Ynysforgan.</p>
      <p>A video shows plumes of water which reached several feet above the street. Welsh Water said the leak was repaired quickly.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Welsh Water said: “We became aware of a leak in Ynysforgan, Swansea, on Friday, November 15, and were on site immediately to deal with the situation.</p>
      <p>“The leak was repaired very quickly and there was minimal impact on customer supply throughout.”</p>
      <p>In September <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/burst-water-mains-pontardawe-welsh-16939746">a similar incident happened</a> after gallons of water blasted high into the air after water mains bursts in Pontardawe, which left a small number of properties without water.</p>
