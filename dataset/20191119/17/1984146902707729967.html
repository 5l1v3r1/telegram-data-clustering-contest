      <p>A vulnerable pensioner with dementia has gone missing after leaving his home to go on a walk.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/durham-constabulary">Durham Constabulary</a> has now launched a search for Alan Mason who has not been seen for several hours.</p>
      <p>The 83-year-old was last seen leaving his home in Sherburn Village, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a> at 2.20pm on Tuesday to go for a walk.</p>
      <p>He normally returns after around 30 minutes, but he has <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/missing-people">not been seen since.</a></p>
      <p>Due to Alan's dementia he could be confused and officers are becoming "very concerned" for his welfare.</p>
      <p>Temperatures across England dropped as low as -7C on Monday night and on Tuesday another cold night has been predicted.</p>
      <p>Anyone who sees Alan or knows of his whereabouts is asked to ring Durham Constabulary straightaway on 101, quoting incident number 241 of November 19.</p>
