      <h2>President’s Colour is the highest honour bestowed upon a military unit</h2>

      <p>President Ram Nath Kovind arrived at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) here on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>He arrived at the Kannur international airport at 4.20 p.m., where he was received by Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Minister of Ports Kadannappally Ramachandran, and District Collector T.V. Subhash. He later flew by a helicopter of the Air Force to the INA, where he was received by Chief of the Naval Staff Karambir Singh, Kochi Southern Naval Command Flag Officer Commanding in Chief Vice Admiral A.K. Chawla, Ezhimala Naval Academy Commandant Vice Admiral Dinesh K. Tripathi, and MLA C. Krishnan.</p>
      <p>He is at the INA to award President’s Colour to the Indian Naval Academy on Wednesday. The President’s Colour is the highest honour bestowed upon a military unit. According to the INA, the award is a recognition of the service rendered by the institution in training and shaping Indian naval officers over the last 50 years at three different locations — Kochi, Goa and Ezhimala.</p>
      <p>Before India became a Republic, the military custom was to parade the King’s Colours – a regimental flag — on special ceremonial occasions. On 27 February 1951, the then Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy Vice Admiral Sir Edward Parry wrote to the Defence Minister requesting a special flag. He wrote that “it would be a privilege of which the service would be extremely proud, if the President would honour the Indian Navy by presenting it, a special flag which would be paraded on important occasions in a ceremonial parade”.</p>
      <p>Following this, the Indian Navy became the first among the three services to be presented with the President’s Colour on May 27, 1951 by the then President Rajendra Prasad.</p>
      <h3>Recipients till date</h3>
      <p>The President’s Colour has thus far been awarded to the Southern Naval Command, Eastern Naval Command, Western Naval Command, Western Fleet, Eastern Fleet and the Submarine Arm in the Indian Navy, according to the INA.</p>
      <p>The Naval Academy was first established at a temporary location at Kochi in 1969. With the increase in strength of the trainees, the academy was relocated to INS Mandovi at Goa in 1986.</p>
      <p>The Indian Naval Academy found its permanent home at Ezhimala, and was inaugurated on January 8, 2009.</p>
      <h3>Parade by cadets</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday, the day will be marked by a parade by cadets of the INA, and will be attended by the Governor, Chief of the Naval Staff, MPs, State Ministers and senior officers of the Indian Navy. A special postal cover will also be released to commemorate the occasion.</p>
