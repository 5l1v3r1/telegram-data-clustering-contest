      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Rosie_O_Donnell/?tps=1">Rosie O'Donnell</a> says she's "hoping for the best" when it comes to her future with her fiancée.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old television personality addressed reports that she and Elizabeth Rooney have ended their engagement in an <a href="https://extratv.com/2019/11/18/rosie-odonnell-talks-the-success-of-her-theater-kids-program-plus-her-relationship-status/">interview</a> Monday with<i> Extra</i>.</p>
      <p>O'Donnell was attending an event for her non-profit Rosie's Theater Kids when she gave the update on her relationship status.</p>
      <p>"We are still figuring things out -- it's hard in the public light," O'Donnell said. "It's hard for a person who is a normal person in a normal job. I'm kind of used to it.</p>
      <p>"We are trying to figure it out," she added. "I am a hopeful person and I am hoping for the best."</p>
      <p>O'Donnell shared similar sentiments in an <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rosie-odonnell-ex-elizabeth-rooney-are-trying-to-work-it-out/">interview</a> with Us Weekly on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>"We're trying to work out what's going on," she said. "[Rooney's] a police officer and she's young and there's a lot of attention on [us]. We're just taking it slow."</p>
      <p>O'Donnell<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DPsaFADkg/"> attended</a> the event with her children Blake Christopher, 19, and Vivienne Rose, 16, in Rooney's absence. She is also parent to Parker Jaren, 24, Chelsea Belle, 22, and Dakota, 6.</p>
      <p>Radar Online <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/10/rosie-odonnell-splits-from-cop-fiancee-elizabeth-rooney-after-engagement/">said</a> in October that O'Donnell and Rooney have called it quits.</p>
      <p>O'Donnell had <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/10/23/Rosie-ODonnell-engaged-to-police-officer-Elizabeth-Rooney/9541540299507/">announced her engagement</a> to Rooney, a mounted police officer and army veteran who is 23 years her junior, in October 2018.</p>
      <p>"I think she's a wonderful woman," she said at the time. "She's very much an equal, she's very much her own person and loves what she does. She's a pretty unbelievable young woman."</p>
      <p>O'Donnell was previously married to <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kelli_Carpenter/?tps=1">Kelli Carpenter</a> and Michelle Rounds. Rounds <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2017/09/16/Rosie-ODonnells-ex-wife-Michelle-Rounds-dies-at-the-age-of-46/6671505563518/">died of an apparent suicide</a> in September 2017.</p>
