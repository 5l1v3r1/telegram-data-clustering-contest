      <h1>Dr. Stone's Riichiro Inagaki &amp; Boichi Share Secrets of Shonen Jump Success</h1>

      <p>The post-apocalyptic, civilization-rebuilding science-adventure <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/dr-stone/"><i>Dr. Stone</i></a> has become one of the most entertaining and popular manga series running in<i> Shonen Jump</i>, resulting in an anime adaptation that is currently simulcasting on Crunchyroll and FUNimation as well as airing Saturdays at midnight on Toonami. At Anime NYC, CBR spoke with <i>Dr.</i> <i>Stone</i>'s<i> </i>writer Riichiro Inagaki and artist Boichi, who recently created his own spin-off manga <i>Dr. Stone Reboot: Byakuya,</i> on their work on the hit series.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CBR: Inagaki-san, your first big hit was a football manga (<i>Eyeshield 21</i>). Now you're writing a science manga (<i>Dr. Stone</i>). When you were growing up, were you more of a jock or a nerd?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Inagaki:</b> When I was in grade school, I did play sports, baseball, soccer, so I did grow up playing team sports. I think my experiences from that time might be reflected in <i>Eyeshield 21</i>. But that was in grade school, so I would never consider myself a star player, but when it came to brain power, that was where I excelled, so I became a storywriter and a non-athletic person.</p>

        <b>Boichi-san, you've done art for both Japanese manga and Korean manwha. What's the biggest difference between working in the two different industries?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Boichi</b>: That question is really interesting! I have material I can tell you for three days, so let me tell you two differences. First of all, the big difference is the Japanese manga artists have a classical spirit as an artisan, whereas manwha artists have more like a traditional artist point of view. The second is that in Korea, because of political reasons, there are no erotic manga. But Japan does. To me, I think erotic manga is important to providing energy to manga in Japan. It plays the same role as horror films in Hollywood.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you consider <i>Dr. Stone</i> to be part of or inspired by the isekai genre?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Inagaki</b>: As I was writing <i>Dr. Stone</i>, I started to notice there are aspects that reflect the hit genre. Am I gonna avoid it? No, because if I think it’s entertaining, and everyone thinks it’s entertaining, great. Even if it hits that typical genre, I will hit that with a bigger genre ball. On one hand, I would say no, but on the other hand, when there are similarities, that motivates me more to create something even bigger than that genre.</p>

        <b>I feel like you could make a really good crafting-centered video game based on <i>Dr. Stone</i>. Any chance of a game adaptation?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Boichi</b>: [Applauds]</p>
      <p><b>Inagaki</b>: It’s something I really want. If someone can do it for me, definitely.</p>
      <p><b>Boichi</b>: I really hope it can be turned into a game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Inagaki-san, there was <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-part-of-having-a-dad-who-s-a-weekly-jump-manga-1834662245">a story</a> that spread around the internet earlier this year about you getting a bunch of different famous <i>Shonen Jump</i> manga-ka to draw your son a birthday card. Would you want to do any bigger collaborations with any of those manga-ka?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Inagaki</b>: So those manga-ka, they’re actually just my personal friends. I gathered them and put it up on social media and it went a little bit viral. I’m a little afraid of the results of that! They are just my personal friends, so do I want to do a collaboration with them? Definitely not!</p>

        <b>Boichi-san, you're now writing a spin-off series, <i>Dr. Stone Reboot: Byakuya</i>. What's it like to go from drawing these characters to now also writing for them?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Boichi</b>: I would like to ask you to imagine my position. It’s like I just had a jackpot at a casino, and on the way out, I won a lottery at the same time! This chance came to me with Inagaki-sensei to create <i>Dr. Stone</i>, I thought it could not be better than this in my life. Now I’m doing the spin-off, and now I have this lotto! Imagine that’s how I feel. So that was how I felt when we started, but once we started I told myself to calm down. In the <i>Reboot</i>, what’s important is I am trying to learn from the story Inagaki-sensei created and the editing that [Hiroyuki Honda, editor of <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i>] does. I told myself this is an important chance to learn a lot from these artists. I’m learning story from Inagaki-sensei and that story is actually published on <i>Shonen Jump</i>. Wow! That’s fantastic!</p>
      <p>
        <b>How will <i>Dr. Stone Reboot: Byakuya</i> proceed from here? Please let us know what you can.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Boichi:</b> I really don’t know how far I can reveal to you. When we first discussed the storyline with Honda-san, my question was “Is it OK I have so few characters?” Honda-san assured me that would be OK. Up until the fourth chapter of <i>Byakuya</i>, you can still see the similarity to <i>Dr. Stone</i>. However, after it will reveal more traditional science fiction.</p>

        <b>The <i>Dr. Stone</i> manga is currently in its third major story arc. How many arcs do you see this story going for? Is <i>Dr. Stone</i> going be a relatively contained story like <i>The Promised Neverland</i> or is it the goal to go on as long as <i>One Piece</i>?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Inagaki:</b> I get this question often, and it’s an answer that’s hard to give. We have a certain goal we’re striving for, but as far as the journey goes that’s unknown. It might be a windy U-turn, it might be a short journey, it might be a long-journey. It’s hard to answer. I actually asked that question myself to Boichi-sensei in the past, and he said, “Do whatever you feel does justice to the story.”</p>
      <p><b>Boichi:</b> I hope it will last for a million years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So you gotta train your successors for when you’re dead.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Boichi:</b> I should be evolved into a new being to live and continue <i>Dr. Stone</i>!</p>
      <p><i>New episodes of </i>Dr. Stone <i>air every Saturday night as part of Adult Swim's Toonami block, and are available on Crunchyroll. Viz Media publishes chapters of the manga in English weekly.</i></p>
