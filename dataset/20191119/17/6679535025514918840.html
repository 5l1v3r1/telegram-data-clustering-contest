      <p>All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday launched a counter attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee after she took an oblique jab at him and warned of ‘minority extremism’ based in Hyderabad.</p>
      <p>The Trinamool Congress chief was reportedly addressing a gathering in Cooch Behar in West Bengal where she made the statements.</p>
      <p>Taking to micro-blogging site Twitter, Mr. Owaisi, who represents Hyderabad in the Lok Sabha, said, “Its not religious extremism to say that Bengal’s Muslims have one of the worst development indicators of any minority. If Didi is worried about a bunch of us ‘from Hyderabad’ then she should tell us how BJP won 18/42 LS seats from Bengal”.</p>
      <p>In another set of tweets, AIMIM’s verified Twitter handle quoted Mr. Owaisi, who was speaking to the media, as saying, “What is extremism? Extremism is when you don’t empower Muslims, give them their rightful share, education and reservations, don’t allow a political leadership to emerge. Mamata Banerjee is practicing this extremism.”</p>
