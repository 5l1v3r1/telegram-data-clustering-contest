      <p><b>ZAGREB, CroatiaÂ (AP)</b> - Croatia's first-ever presidency in the European Union will come at come at a "critical period" for the 28-nation bloc, outgoing EU leader Donald Tusk said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The EU's newest member could end up in charge of launching the bloc's post-Brexit negotiations with Britain, the European Council president said after talks with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic.</p>
      <p>Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013, takes over the bloc's six-month rotating chairmanship at the beginning of January while Britain's departure from the bloc is now set for Jan. 31.</p>
      <p>"Your task is not easy," said Tusk. "It will be a critical period for the EU and we will be relying on your steady leadership."</p>
      <p>Tusk expressed confidence in Croatia's preparation for the job, adding that Croatia also needs to focus on the EU's enlargement agenda and the volatile Western Balkans.</p>
      <p>EU aspirations in the Western Balkans have been dealt a blow after France and the Netherlands blocked the opening of membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania.</p>
      <p>"I deeply believe that you (Croatia) will do everything in your power to restore EU unity and enlargement while demonstrating positive EU engagement in the region," Tusk said.</p>
      <p>Tusk was in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, for a meeting of the European People's Party, the main center-right bloc in the European Parliament. The Polish politician is expected to be elected the leader of the alliance during the two-day gathering.</p>
      <p>"I am leaving the EU in good hands," he said.</p>
