      <p>The Dolphins cut running back Mark Walton on Tuesday morning after he was accused of attacking a woman who was five weeks pregnant with his child.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/CameronWolfe/status/1196835470258450432">According to a police report obtained by ESPN</a>, it is alleged that Walton pushed the woman into a wall and punched her several times in her face and head. Walton found out he was the father on Sunday, <a href="https://www.local10.com/sports/nfl/dolphins/mark-walton-released-by-dolphins-after-police-matter">according to Miami television station Local 10.</a></p>

      <p>“We were made aware of a police matter earlier this morning regarding Mark Walton,” Dolphins general manager Chris Grier said in a statement. “We hold our players to a high standard and take these matters very seriously. We will have no further comment at this time.”</p>
      <p>Walton, 22, was released by the Bengals last season following three arrests and was in the midst of serving a four-game suspension for Miami as a result of his past problems.</p>
      <p>Walton’s three prior arrests came in a three-month span last year, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/04/bengals-running-back-mark-walton-who-yanked-out-stun-gun-barbs-during-police-chase-surrenders/">included weapons, drugs and battery charges. </a></p>
      <p>Walton, a Miami native, rushed for 201 yards on 53 carries in his seven games with the team.</p>
