      <p>Fina however admitted that Fantana’s songs are good but the only thing that she needs to work on is her stage performance.</p>
      <p>Touting Rufftown Records’ capabilities of grooming talents, the ‘Today’ singer was hopeful the Midas touch will fall on Fantana soon.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the recent misunderstandings between Fantana and the CEO of Rufftown Records, Bullet, Fina said personally, she would have been hurt if her name was omitted from the list of artistes signed on the label that she is working with.</p>
      <p>However, Fina stated that  Fantana was hasty in her decision to leave the record label. Instead she should have taken a pause and addressed the issue because misunderstandings are bound to happen if you are working with people.</p>
