      <p>A cruel pet owner stabbed his sick dog, chained her to a breeze block and left her to drown in a canal, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Brendan Murphy, 52, claimed his Japanese Akita died of natural causes before he buried her body in the woods.</p>
      <p>But the RSPCA launched an investigation after Tara’s weighted body was found floating on the waterway.</p>
      <p>Forensic tests revealed algae present in the dog’s bone marrow indicating she drowned on August 20 last year.</p>
      <p>A post mortem also showed Tara had been battling lung disease for a number of weeks and had been brutally stabbed twice in the abdomen before her body was submerged.</p>
      <p>The scientific evidence, used by the RSPCA for the first time, nailed Murphy who eventually pleaded guilty to three counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal</p>

      <p>Chester Magistrates’ Court heard Tara’s body was discovered in the Shropshire Union Canal near Nantwich, Cheshire, on October 6 last year.</p>

      <p>Her microchip identified Murphy as her owner and he claimed she had died of natural causes.</p>
      <p>He said he visited the woodland where he buried her a few times, but added that around two weeks later the animal had been dug up.</p>
      <p>The case was the first RSPCA prosecution involving forensic tests on an animal’s bone marrow.</p>

        <figcaption>An inspector said it was ‘upsetting’ to think about how much Tara suffered before her death (Picture: SWNS)</figcaption>

      <p>Inspector Andy Harris said: ‘Poor Tara had a lung disease which was left untreated and therefore she was left suffering will this illness for a number of weeks.</p>
      <p>‘She was then stabbed in the abdomen twice before being thrown alive into the canal, where she drowned.</p>
      <p>‘It is upsetting to think about what she must have endured during her final moments.’</p>
      <p>Murphy was further convicted of failing to provide proper and necessary veterinary care.</p>
      <p>He was handed a ten-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, banned from keeping animals for ten years and ordered to pay £300 costs as well as a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
