      <p>Gloria Morgan is the new chair of the Okanagan College board of governors.</p>
      <p>Morgan, who had been serving as the vice-chair, was elected during Tuesday’s board meeting at the college. She replaces Chris Derickson, who had to leave the position after recently getting elected chief of Westbank First Nation.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to serving in this role,” Morgan said in a press release. “With a new building and new programs about to come on stream, and work beginning on our next strategic plan, Okanagan College is at an exciting juncture.”</p>
