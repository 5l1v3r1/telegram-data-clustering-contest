      <p><b>BAGHDAD —</b> Iraqi protesters on Tuesday brushed off new government promises of reform, skeptical that political leaders, and a parliament session later in the day, would deliver the sweeping change they demand.<br/><br/>Lawmakers were scheduled to meet in the evening to discuss a cabinet reshuffle, a draft new electoral law and other changes, but activists in Baghdad's Tahrir (Liberation) Square gave them little credence.<br/><br/>"The trust between the people and the political class has eroded," said Khayriya, a woman in her sixties with an Iraqi tricolor wrapped around her neck.<br/><br/>"Even if they offer every Iraqi a house of gold, that would not help their case," she said. "Politicians are doing the reforms for themselves, not for us."<br/><br/>Protests demanding an overhaul of a political system deemed by many as inefficient and corrupt have rocked Baghdad and the Shiite-majority south since Oct. 1.<br/><br/>The movement continues to gain momentum despite government pledges of reform and a violent crackdown that has left more than 330 people dead.<br/><br/>Late Monday, President Barham Saleh met with the president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Nechirvan Barzani, leaders from the Hashed Al-Shaabi paramilitary network and former premiers.<br/><br/>The gathering, which did not include embattled Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, proposed a raft of reforms and new legislation including the revamped electoral law, according to a summary.<br/><br/>If the reforms were not complete within 45 days, the top leaders pledged to call for early parliamentary elections or withdraw legitimacy from government, or both.<br/><br/>The priority for most political parties has been amending the country's electoral law, but protesters have snubbed the suggestions.<br/><br/>"Whether they amend it or not, the same figures will still return," said Haydar, 25, at Tahrir Square.<br/><br/>"It is a game of chess — they will just move the pieces around," he said.<br/><br/>In a rare move, Abdel Mahdi was due to take part in the parliamentary session, to deliver a fresh list of candidates to head ministries that will be affected by reforms, his office said.<br/><br/>But, after weeks of unrest, crowds again hit the streets, and schools and government offices remained shut, in Iraq's southern hot spots of Kut, Najaf, Diwaniyah, Hilla and Nasiriyah.<br/><br/>Protesters also burnt car tires and blocked roads leading to oil fields south of the port city of Basra.<br/><br/>In Baghdad, they gathered in Tahrir and on the nearby Al-Sinek and Al-Ahrar (Free Men) bridges, parts of which were reoccupied by demonstrators this week.<br/><br/>"The young generation does not believe in amendments, or reform," said Abu Haydar, a man in his seventies.<br/><br/>"They believe in only one thing: the complete overhaul of government and parliament." — AFP</p>
