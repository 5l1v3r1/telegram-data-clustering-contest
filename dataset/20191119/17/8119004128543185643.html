        <b>Bangladesh Bank has raised the maximum limit for home loans to Tk 20 million from Tk 12 million due to rising apartment prices and the purchasing capacity of people.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The central bank on Tuesday wrote to the commercial banks to follow the order.</p>
      <p>The Association of Bankers Bangladesh demanded that the central bank increase the home-loan limit in a meeting on Nov 7.</p>
      <p>Tuesdayâ€™s circular was issued in light of the demand, BB Deputy General Manager AKM Ahsan said.</p>
      <p>The circular says the central bank considered the rise in prices of building materials, size of higher middleclass population, and demand for housing.</p>
      <p>The loan to capital ratio has been kept at 70:30, which means a bank can finance up to Tk 7 million in a Tk 10 million flat.</p>
