      <p><b>MEXICO CITY (AP)</b> - A couple of hundred demonstrators have protested against a proposed Mexico City law that would allow children and adolescents to change the gender listed on their birth certificates.</p>
      <p>They would have to be accompanied by at least one guardian to do so.</p>
      <p>Mexico City law already allows adults to legally change their gender.</p>
      <p>A coalition of anti-abortion and other groups protested outside the city council building Tuesday, holding signs reading "No to The Trans Law," and "Don't Confuse Children."</p>
      <p>They argued children cannot be expected to make such a decision.</p>
      <p>City council commissions approved the proposed legal changes Nov. 14. Voting in favor was the Morena party of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, which holds a majority in the city.</p>
      <p>The bill still must be approved by the full council.</p>
