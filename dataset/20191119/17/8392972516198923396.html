      <aside>We spent over £300 on Christmas decorations at B&amp;M today and I don’t even feel guilty. It made me happy.</aside>
      <p>"Add shimmering colour to your home over the festive period with this Magical Light Up Glitter Globe. Ideal for bringing impactful light to your home at Christmas," said the blurb.</p>

      <p>The globes were going down a storm with shoppers, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10375496/bm-light-up-glitter-snow-globes-christmas/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunmaintwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574163129">The Sun</a>, so it appears you'll have to move fast if you want to get one.</p>
      <p>You'll have to brave the cold and head to your nearest store too, as sadly B&amp;M doesn't offer online shopping.</p>

      <p>One Facebook user tagged her friend in a post about the globes and said: "If you are ever there can you pick me one up? I absolutely love it and will pay the £15 if I have to."</p>
      <p>Another said: "I saw these yesterday but I was looking for the projector ones and couldn't find them, that looks so lovely, I've got to go back."</p>
