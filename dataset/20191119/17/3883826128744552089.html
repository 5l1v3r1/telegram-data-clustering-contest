        <b>The Twitter account of Arron Banks, the founder of the pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU, has been hacked.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The perpetrator has leaked thousands of his private messages to and from dozens of other people spanning several years.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Mr Banks accused Twitter of taking too long to tackle the issue and said the social network had "deliberately chosen" to leave his personal information online.</p>
      <p>Twitter said it had "taken steps to secure the compromised account".</p>
      <p>"We will continue to take firm enforcement action in line with <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hacked-materials">our policy</a> which strictly prohibits the distribution on our service of materials obtained through hacking," Twitter said in a statement.</p>

      <p>It is not known who carried out the attack.</p>
      <p>The data was made available by the hackers in the form of a link to a download. The original file is no longer online.</p>
      <p>One expert said the hacker, if caught, could be prosecuted under the Computer Misuse Act, and that others who made use of the material would be walking into a legal minefield.</p>
      <p>"Even if Arron Banks was using Twitter in a private capacity rather than as Leave.EU, the data was misappropriated from Twitter and that likely engages the Data Protection Act," commented Tim Turner, a data protection consultant.</p>
      <p>"There are public interest defences for using unlawfully obtained data, but that requires a journalist or other person to gamble that they can successfully argue that the public interest supports whatever use they make of it.</p>
      <p>"You cannot know for certain that the public interest will back up any particular course of action; a person would have to act first, and see what follows."</p>
      <p>Avon and Somerset Police has confirmed that it is investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>"We're investigating whether any offences have been committed under the Computer Misuse Act after we received a report a Twitter account was compromised," said a spokesman.</p>
      <p>In February 2019, Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by Mr Banks were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47087440">fined Â£120,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office for breaching data protection laws</a>.</p>
      <p>"Arron Banks has shown extraordinary contempt for the ICO and British data laws and so this is a moment for him to reflect on the need for those laws and a regulator to enforce them," said the journalist Carole Cadwalladr.</p>
      <p>Ms Cadwalladr and Mr Banks have had many battles over her investigations into his affairs.</p>

      <p>She said in a tweet that she had been sent some direct messages, said to be from the hacked account.</p>
      <p>They were "pretty explosive" she tweeted.</p>
      <p>Ms Cadwalladr told the BBC she had not downloaded any data.</p>
      <p>Mr Banks' Twitter account was suspended following the breach but is now working again.</p>
