      <h1>What happened in Brazil win today to Liverpool’s three Samba Boys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:04:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Brazil eased past South Korea in, well… Abu Dhabi today… because, where else would you play a meaningless friendly between countries from South America and Asia?</p>
      <p>Tite’s men ran out 3-0 winners, with goals from Paqueta, Coutinho (a stunning freekick – the kind we used to see at Anfield a fair bit) and Danilo.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool fans will be solely interested in how the Reds got on…</p>
      <p>Alisson played the full 90 minutes and racked up his first clean-sheet of the season. Hopefully, it’ll be the first of many since his return from a calf injury.</p>
      <p>Fabinho also got a full 90 minutes in holding midfield, which is a little annoying – but he didn’t have to work especially hard in what was a game that lacked tempo.</p>
      <p>In good news for Liverpool fans, Roberto Firmino only got six minutes at the end, which will mean despite the travelling, he’ll hopefully be fit and ready for the Crystal Palace game on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>There is now no international break until March – which is a truly beautiful thought!</p>
