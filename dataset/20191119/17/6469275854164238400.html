        <b>Derby County keeper Kelle Roos says the struggling Rams are ready to make a surge up the table, ahead of this weekend’s visit from Preston North End.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ever-present Roos is banking on home form to upset Alex Neil’s high-flying Lilywhites – County have four wins and three draws from their eight Championship games at Pride Park this season.</p>

      <p>He has told this weekend’s edition of The Ram, the club’s matchday programme for PNE’s visit – that they are ready to capitalise on their hard work on the training ground in the coming games.</p>
      <p>Phillip Cocu’s men are 16th in the table, a position they are desperate to improve upon prior to ex-England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney joining them in January.</p>
      <p>“It all starts on the training ground,” said Roos.</p>
      <p>“You must work hard every day and then that becomes the mindset.</p>
      <p>“At home we have a little run going, but away from home it’s not going how we want it to and I feel like it’s down to small margins.</p>
      <p>“We are not far away from getting a few wins on the road but it’s now about doing the things that can help us pick up results.</p>
      <p>“I think if we can do that then we will climb up the table quickly.”</p>
