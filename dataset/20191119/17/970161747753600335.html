      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/edinson-cavani/">Edinson Cavani</a> has played down his spat with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lionel-messi/">Lionel Messi</a> after claims the striker asked the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/argentina-national-team/">Argentina</a> captain if he ‘wanted to fight’.</p>
      <p>Argentina and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/uruguay-national-team/">Uruguay</a> played out a heated 2-2 draw in Tel Aviv on Monday night, which saw <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/edinson-cavani-offers-fight-lionel-messi-argentinas-clash-uruguay-11179013/">Cavani and Messi clash on several occasions</a>.</p>
      <p>An argument broke out in the first half following a strong tackle and Cavani reportedly invited Messi to settle their differences.</p>
      <p>Messi replied to the fight offer with ‘whenever you want’ and the pair needed to be separated in the tunnel by Barcelona and Uruguay striker Luiz Suarez as tempers continued to boil over off the pitch.</p>

      <p>Cavani has now spoken about the incident, insisting it was all part of the rivalry between Argentine and Uruguay.</p>
      <p>‘It’s part of football, Clasicos are like this,’ he said after the game.</p>

      <p>‘The truth is that it was at times a game that had friction, there were challenges and things that are part of football, especially of South American [football].</p>
      <p>‘We take positives from our performance and the fact that we were able to score two goals. We still need to improve but it’s good to end the year like this.’</p>
      <p>Uruguay twice led against Argentina through Cavani and Suarez, before Messi scored a 90th-minute free-kick to rescue a draw for his side in the friendly.</p>
      <p>It was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/lionel-messi-tells-brazil-coach-tite-shut-return-three-month-ban-11166115/">just the second time Messi featured for Argentina</a> since serving a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/03/lionel-messi-banned-international-football-three-months-claiming-copa-america-corrupt-10510693/">three-month ban for claiming the Copa America was rigged</a> in Brazil’s favour.</p>
