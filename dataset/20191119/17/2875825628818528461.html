      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/diego-maradona">Diego Maradona</a> has quit as manager of Argentine top-flight side Gimnasia after just two months at the helm.</p>
      <p>The 59 year-old has walked away from his post after deciding not to take training on Tuesday, club president Gabriel Pellegrino confirmed.</p>
      <p>The legendary former player was said to be considering leaving the Superliga club following the president’s decision not to run for re-election.</p>
      <p>And Mr Pellegrino told Argentinian radio station <i>La Red:</i> “Maradona stopped working today. He is no longer the manager of Gimnasia.</p>
      <p>“He would love to stay, but what he wants is unity.”</p>

      <p>Maradona, the often-controversial former Argentina superstar, who led his country to the World Cup in 1986, was only presented as manager of the club, based in La Plata an hour’s drive south of Buenos Aires, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/diego-maradona-vows-rescue-gimnasia-19911108">on September 8.</a></p>
      <p>The side enjoyed three away victories and five defeats during his eight games in charge.</p>
      <p>He leaves Gimnasia in 22nd place in the league, having recently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/diego-maradona-sits-pitchside-throne-20754156">sat on a pitchside throne</a> during their 4-0 win at one of his former clubs, Newell's Old Boys.</p>
      <p>Throughout that match, 'Diego Cam' was permanently trained on Maradona.</p>
      <p>Already Maradona is being linked with a return to Mexican side Dorados de Sinaloa.</p>
      <p>Mexican newspaper <i>El Universal</i> said Sinaloa president Antonio Nunez had contacted him to sound him out about a second spell at the club.</p>
      <p>The former Naples and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> ’s time at the club in the northern Mexican city of Culiacan, the heart of the Sinaloa cartel, forms the basis for a new <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> document-series.</p>
