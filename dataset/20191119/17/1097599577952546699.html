      <p>Leak detection works may cause supply disruptions to parts of Moyglass and surrounding areas during the early hours of Thursday morning this week.</p>
      <p>These works are part of the National Leakage Reduction Programme being carried out by Irish Water to safeguard water supplies and reduce leakage in the area. </p>
      <p>Works are scheduled to take place in the Moyglass District Metered Area from 1am until 5am on November 21.</p>
      <p>The water supply should return from 5am. However we recommend that you allow 2-3 hours after the estimated restoration time for your supply to fully return.</p>
      <p>We would like to thank customers in the area for their patience and support as we carry out this work.</p>
      <p>Further details are available on the Service and Supply section of the Irish Water website, www.water.ie</p>
