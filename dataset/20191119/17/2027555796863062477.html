      <h1>Liquor shops in Madhya Pradesh to go green</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:57:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/rakesh-dixit-0" target="_blank">Rakesh Dixit</a></address>
      <p>Liquor shops in Madhya Pradesh will go green. The excise department has asked the contractors operating liquor shops to plant at least 10 saplings in their vicinity.</p>
      <p>The department will monitor the shops every three months to check the maintenance of greenery, and if saplings are found withering, the contractors will be obliged to plant 10 fresh trees. The tree-plantation is launched under Clean Circle-Green Circle campaign in the state from Indore. </p>
      <p>Indore circle assistant excise commissioner Raj Narayan Soni said over 200 liquor shops in the district are being covered in the campaign. Owners have been told to take special care of cleanliness and plantation around the shops. The excise department has done Geo-tagging of the saplings to periodically monitor their growth. A special mobile app has been prepared for Geo-tagging. Tagged with a barcode, the saplings could be fed in the mobile through scanning. This will provide the location of each sapling in the mobile App.</p>
      <p>Indore has the distinction of winning the cleanest city in India award for the last three years. Combined efforts of the municipal corporation, NGOs, commercial establishments and citizenry have turned cleanliness in the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh into a people’s movement.</p>
      <p>On March 5 this year, the central government's cleanliness survey declared Indore as India's 'Cleanest City' for the third year in a row.</p>
      <p>The city was awarded for this achievement during the Swachh Survekshan Awards 2019. The honour was conferred by President Ram Nath Kovind at a ceremony in Delhi. </p>
