      <p>Here is your Netflix binge-list for the week, fresh from the Australian servers! This week's highlights include new episodes of zombie series <i>Z Nation</i>, the supernatural thriller <i>Mortel</i>, a holiday-themed series of<i> Nailed It!</i>, <i>High Seas Season 2</i> and three new documentaries.</p>
      <p>Read on for everything coming to the service for the week of November 18 to November 24.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/disney-plus-australian-pricing-library-and-release-date">Disney Plus launching in Australia tomorrow</a>, we were expecting Netflix to add a killer lineup of must-watch content. Instead, what we're getting is pretty middle-of-the-road, with little in the way of standout titles. Surprisingly, there are no new third-party movies joining Netflix this week or for the rest of the month. Hmmm.</p>
