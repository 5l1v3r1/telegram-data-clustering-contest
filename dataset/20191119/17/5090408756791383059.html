        <li>A hotel in <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/japan">Japan</a> is offering a guest room for 100 yen – that’s $0.92 – per night.</li>
        <li>The catch? Guests must agree to a 24-hour <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/youtube">YouTube</a> livestream of their stay.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/category/hotels">hotel</a> is attempting to fill a room that they say is generally empty and garner some buzz.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/best-places-to-visit-in-japan-2019-2">Japan</a> is not exactly known as the most <a href="https://www.insider.com/best-budget-travel-destinations-lonely-planet-2019-2018-10">affordable country</a> to visit, so a room for 100 yen ($0.92) might come as a welcome surprise for many.</p>
      <p>The catch, however, is that guests give up their privacy, agreeing to a livestream on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGp5tr2rRZCWhALrp9BBkw">the hotel’s YouTube channel</a> for 24 hours. The channel has over 2,000 subscribers.</p>

        <figcaption>The hotel also goes by the moniker “One Dollar Hotel.”<cite><a href="https://website-2466167782178721348122-hotel.business.site/?m=true#gallery">Business Ryokan Asahi</a></cite></figcaption>

      <p>This “deal” can be found at the <a href="https://website-2466167782178721348122-hotel.business.site/?m=true">Business Ryokan Asahi</a> in Fukuoka, <a href="https://www.insider.com/things-to-know-when-traveling-from-us-to-japan-2018-11">Japan</a>, and is available year-round for room number 8.</p>
      <p>The room is a regular Japanese-style hotel room, with a tatami floor (a type of mat common in the country), and a foldable sleeping mat. There’s also a small coffee table, a TV, and a kettle. The only irregularity: a tablet with a functioning camera pointing to the middle of the room, allowing for no blind spots.</p>
      <p>The good news is that there’s no nudity allowed, and neither is any sexual activity, or what the website refers to as “lewd acts.” As is the norm for inexpensive ryokans (traditional Japanese inns), bathrooms are shared, and guests are expected to change there, and not on camera.</p>

        <figcaption>There’s not a whole lot to see as guests don’t spend that much time in the basic room.<cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGp5tr2rRZCWhALrp9BBkw">One Dollar Hotel/YouTube</a></cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Another small mercy: The livestream is video only, so your calls and conversations remain private. You are also allowed to turn off the lights.</p>
      <p>The hotel also warns guests of showing the camera any personal information, such as their address or credit card details.</p>
      <p>Some people seem to enjoy the attention, and even interact with viewers, who can comment on the livestream.</p>

      <p>According to Sora News 24, <a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/13/japans-cheapest-hotel-charges-just-130-yen-us1-20-for-a-room-with-a-huge-no-privacy-catch/">which sent a reporter to spend the night in the unconventional room</a>, the hotel created this “Big Brother”-esque arrangement because it was the least-booked room, and it thought this might not only fill the room but also get the hotel a little viral buzz.</p>
      <p>Sora News 24 says that many online booking sites are reluctant to list the room, but that you can simply ask the hotel for it when booking by phone.</p>
