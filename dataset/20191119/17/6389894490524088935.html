      <p>LEGENDARY Hong Kong trainer Tony Cruz must have breathed a huge sigh of relief when his stable star Exultant won the Group 2 Jockey Club Cup at Sha Tin on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Cruz had to suffer a tough five week-period with 55 runners in total failing to make it into the winners’ enclosure before Exultant broke that long losing sequence.</p>
      <p>It’s not as if his stable were under performing, but when lady luck is against you, it’s a matter of patience until the wheel of fortune turns in your favour again.</p>
      <p>Cruz sends a handful of raiders to Happy Valley today and will be hopeful his disappointing form of late can prove a distant memory.</p>
      <p>Front-running Casa de Forca looks to be his best chance of success when lining-up in the Hibiscus Handicap (12.50pm) over the extended mile.</p>
      <p>This looks a tough handicap however, with a number of rivals looking close to their best and it could be a matter of who gets the ideal journey during the race.</p>
      <p>A better proposition for Cruz could be the lightly-raced <b>MR ALDAN</b> who contests the Roselle Handicap (2.20pm).</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on the John Size-trained Picken who never saw daylight until too late when a close-up fifth over seven furlongs at Sha Tin recently.</p>
      <p>In the same race, Mr Aldan found himself at the tail end of the field and facing an impossible task, until exploding in the final furlong.</p>
      <p>This time with Karis Teetan in the saddle he can improve sufficiently, especially over this longer trip and reward each-way support.</p>
      <p>
        <b>POINTERS</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mr Aldan</b> e/w 2.20pm Happy Valley</p>
