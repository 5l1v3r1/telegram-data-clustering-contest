      <h1>League of Ireland transfer news: Ethan Boyle joins Linfield from Shamrock Rovers</h1>
      <h2>The former Hoops defender, 22, lost his place in the Rovers team this season and became a peripheral figure</h2>

      <p>Ethan Boyle has joined Linfield from Shamrock Rovers. <br/><br/>The former Hoops defender, 22, lost his place in the Rovers team this season and became a peripheral figure. <br/><br/>The Wexford man was not involved in the FAI Cup final win over Dundalk and has penned a one-and-a-half year deal with the Belfast kingpins. <br/><br/>Boyle, who cannot play until January, was also a target for Derry City and is believed to have held talks with Declan Devine last week. <br/><br/>But he said today: “It’s an exciting new challenge for me. Linfield are a very big club on this island and will be challenging for major silverware.” <br/><br/>Linfield boss David Healy said: “We believe Ethan can make a significant contribution to the club,” Healy said. <br/><br/>“He’s a much sought after player and I want to thank the club’s team committee for their backing in helping to bring Ethan to the club. <br/><br/>Aaron Barry has dropped into the First Division after signing for Bray Wanderers. The centre-back - from Arklow in Co Wicklow - spent last season on loan with Bohemians from Cork City. <br/><br/>Elsewhere, the courts have granted an extension to Limerick FC’s period of examinership after hearing of eight expressions of interest in the crisis-club.</p>
