      <p>Need a new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-smart-speakers">smart speaker</a>? The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/google-home-mini">Google Home Mini</a> is currently discounted for Black Friday, with most outlets slashing the price by nearly 50%. </p>
      <p>At Very, Currys, and John Lewis, you can get your hands on Google's cutest smart speaker for just £29 – that's a price cut of £20.</p>
      <p>It's got the smarts of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/how-to/google-assistant-how-to-make-your-google-home-speaker-work-for-you">Google Assistant</a> built right in, which is always at the ready to help you find answers, turn on the tunes, dim the lights, start a TV show and more by using nothing but your voice.</p>
      <p>It's more of a desk buddy than an audiophile speaker and it's been usurped by the newer <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/google-nest-mini-release-date-price-and-features">Google Nest Mini</a>, but we don't think you should write off the original Mini just yet – its incredible value makes it the cheapest way to buy into the Google Assistant ecosystem right now. </p>
      <p>It's entirely possible that this price could drop even lower over <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/cyber-monday/cyber-monday-2019">Cyber Monday</a>, perhaps reaching £25 – but if you need a smart speaker and don't want to wait, check out the deals below:</p>
