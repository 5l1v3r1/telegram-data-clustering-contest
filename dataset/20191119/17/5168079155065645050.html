      <p><b>Muscat: </b>Shams Global Solutions (SGS) in association with BP Oman’s Social Investment Programme, inaugurated a state-of-the-art solar training facility located on the campus of the German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech), on Tuesday.<br/><br/>The event was held as part of Oman’s 49th National Day celebrations. Qais bin Saud Al Zakwani, executive director of the Authority for Electricity Regulation was the Guest of Honour for the inauguration and was accompanied by Eng. Yousuf Al Ojaili, BP Oman President. Many other senior officials from the public and private sector were also present on the occasion.<br/><br/>“We aim to harness innovation and research skills through the delivery of practical and experiential initiatives,” said Shamsa Al Rawahi, BP Oman’s Social Investment Manager. “Oman’s solar sector has the potential for growth and it is necessary to enable people and equip them with the right skill set to complement it. SGS’s new facility is well integrated to do so,” she added.<br/><br/>Located on the campus of the German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech), the facility is the outcome of a unique cooperation between SGS, BP Oman, and GUtech. “We are very glad to see the facility running and being utilised for its purpose,” said Prof. Dr Ing. Michael Modigell, Rector of GUtech.</p>
      <p>The facility includes four different solar systems totalling 18 kWp (kilowatt peak) of solar power and four training zones, one of which is a dedicated interface protection zone. The facility has three different installation types (flat-roof, pitched-roof and ground-mounted systems), designed to the exact specification of the Authority for Electricity Regulation’s (AER) grid-connected solar regulations released in 2017. The facility is designed to simulate real-world building and installation sites. SGS’s training is provided in partnership with Solar Energy International (USA) who have been delivering firsthand training for over 25-years.<br/><br/>“The inauguration of this facility is an indication of our commitment to advance the growth of renewable energy in the Sultanate. We want to contribute to energy diversification and increase production from cleaner sources,” said Dr Michael Tsang, Co-Founder of SGS. “We are aiming to strengthen this ambition to keep the renewables sector growing in Oman and tap into other resources of energy,” he added.<br/><br/><br/><br/>SGS collaborated with Solar Energy International to launch a solar photovoltaic training programme that is certified and approved by Oman’s DCRP (Distribution Code Review Panel) last year. The course has enabled hundreds of the country’s next generation of solar professionals to be an integral part of Oman’s renewable energy sector.<br/><br/>Shams Global Solutions is a private company focused on creating and delivering educational and training services for sustainability in the Middle East. Based out of Muscat, Oman, their mission is to develop local capacity and strengthen renewable energy as well as the sustainability of the marketplace both locally and regionally. Working towards this goal, they provide technical training and services related to solar power, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainability.</p>
