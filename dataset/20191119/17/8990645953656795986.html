      <h1>Whataburger Unveils Christmas Inflatable for your Festive Yard</h1>

      <p>Whataburger will never stop making stuff with their logo on it.</p>
      <p>Whataburger is the only fast food brand I know that puts their logo on stuff like this. I think it's because Texans have a lot of pride in Whataburger and love to show off that pride. Some of the more recent items are <a href="https://1063thebuzz.com/whataburger-remembers-their-texas-roots-with-new-cowboy-boots/">boots</a>,<a href="https://1063thebuzz.com/james-avery-unveils-new-whataburger-charm-for-the-fry-lover-in-your-life/"> jewelry</a> and <a href="https://1063thebuzz.com/whataburger-unveils-2019-christmas-sweater-for-your-stupid-parties/">ugly Christmas sweaters</a>. To go along with that sweater, you can now have a Christmas inflatable in your yard.</p>

      <p>It's the big man himself, Santa Clause coming out of a Whataburger cup. Sort of like him going down the chimney. The decoration is 7 and a half feet tall and comes with an air blower, stakes and rope. It sells for $85.99 and is available at <a href="https://shop.whataburger.com/gifts/inflatable-santa/">shop.whataburger.com</a>.</p>
