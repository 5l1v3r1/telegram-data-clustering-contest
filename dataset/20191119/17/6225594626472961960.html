      <p>The holidays are fast approaching now, and with Halloween out of the way, we’re already nearly at Thanksgiving. We all know what that means. Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Coming soon. If you were thinking of going for an Oculus or a <a href="https://wersm.com/facebook-will-introduce-new-portal-devices-this-fall/">Facebook Portal</a> device, we’re happy to announce that <a href="https://wersm.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a> is running some Black Friday and Cyber Monday on some of its latest gadgets – the new Portal and the Oculus Quest.</p>
      <p>If you purchase an <a href="https://wersm.com/oculus-announces-oculus-quest-its-first-all-in-one-vr-gaming-system/">Oculus Quest</a> between November 21st and January 31st, you’ll get all three episodes of the Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series for free (normally $29.97) with your headset. The headset will need to be activated within 30 days of purchase to redeem the offer, and that has to happen until 3/2/20.</p>
