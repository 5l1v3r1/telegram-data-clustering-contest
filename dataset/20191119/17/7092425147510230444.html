        <b>Jadon Sancho and Erling Braut Haaland have been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United and a January switch for the pair could now be on the cards.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United are confident they can seal the transfers of Jadon Sancho and Erling Braut Haaland in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is in desperate need of attacking reinforcements with the team having made their worst start to a season in 30 years.</p>
      <p>After losing Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez in the summer, United were left with only Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial as recognised senior strikers at the club.</p>
      <p>Teenager Mason Greenwood is also a forward but is yet to even score a Premier League goal.</p>
      <p>Ed Woodward brought three players – Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James – to Old Trafford last summer and is ready to back under-fire manager Solskjaer with another spending spree.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have already been heavily linked with Sancho and Haaland and, according to Goal, they are confident of acquiring both in January.</p>
      <p>It is claimed Woodward has renewed hope of landing England international Sancho after the 19-year-old clashed with Borussia Dortmund manager Lucien Favre.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga side could now be ready to cash in with the winger’s stock still at its highest point.</p>
      <p>United would have to fork out around £100m for the star though which would break their transfer record.</p>
      <p>Woodward is also keen to bring Haaland to the Premier League, with the Norway international scoring a staggering 22 goals in 18 matches so far this season.</p>
      <p>According to Goal , a deal worth £85m is being lined up and Manchester United would be willing to send Haaland back to Red Bull Salzburg for the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign after capturing his signature.</p>
      <p>United know that something needs to be done and quick to stop the rot at the club and bringing in youngsters of the calibre of Sancho and Haaland could be just the ticket.</p>
      <p>Despite winning two of their last three games, they will resume the Premier League campaign after the international break sitting just seventh in the table, nine points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>And they already find themselves a whopping 18 points behind bitter rivals Liverpool, who are sitting pretty at the top of the league.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen in the coming weeks the numbers that United are willing to fork out in January to bring in new players.</p>
