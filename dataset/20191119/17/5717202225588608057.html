      <h1>Liverpool fans react as club linked with Schalke playmaker Amine Harit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:45:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are reportedly interested in signing Schalke playmaker Amine Harit as Jurgen Klopp looks to take advantage of his friendship with Schalke manager David Wagner – and Liverpool fans reckon he would be an excellent signing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/talent-scout/2019/11/18-63487290/amine_harit_applausi_in_bundesliga_con_lo_schalke/">Italian outlet Corriere Dello Sport have claimed</a> that Liverpool are interested in the 22-year-old, who is described in the report after an excellent start to the 2019-20 campaign as: “not just a juggler, but a refined artist.”</p>
      <p>The France-born, seven-time Morocco international is currently the creative engine in Wagner’s 4-2-3-1 formation at Schalke. Indeed, Harit has had a hand in nine goals during his 15 appearances – scoring five and creating four more.</p>

      <p>Schalke are renowned for creating incredible talent – or acting as a stepping stone for young, impressive players to shine before earning a big-money move. Mesut Ozil, Julian Draxler, Manuel Neuer and Leroy Sane spring to mind.</p>
      <p>Now, it appears Schalke’s next jewel is indeed Harit and Klopp is desperate to bring him to Anfield. Any move, though, will be made to wait until the summer with the Bundesloga club unwilling to do business until then.</p>
      <p>Liverpool fans have reacted on Twitter to the reported news that their club are interested in signing the Moroccan star, with many keen to see him sign. The report claims Liverpool would have to part with £17million to sign the player.</p>
