      <h1>‘Cats’ Movie Trailer Teases a Bizarre Feline Show</h1>

      <p>A new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNTDoOmc1OQ">trailer</a> just dropped for the upcoming <i>Cats</i> film and it teases a strange, yet alluring storyline about a group of passionate felines.</p>
      <p>The movie’s star-studded cast, including Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, and Taylor Swift, has received a “digital fur” makeover, thanks to some CGI tech. Even though the animation is a tad creepy, the movie looks like a lot of fun with dancing, singing, and glittery catnip.</p>

      <p>“Tonight is a magical night…where I chose the cat that deserves a new life,” Judi Dench, who plays Old Deuteronomy, tells all her fellow kitties.</p>
      <p>One cat will be “reborn” in the group, and of course, there is A LOT of competition.</p>
      <p>Contenders include felines who like to eat, cause trouble, and hide in the shadows. And sadly, not all tabbies are welcome to the celebration: Grizabella (Hudson), who is slightly older than her other peers, is turned away multiple times, however, she’s still determined to win.</p>
      <p>Who will be the king or queen of the Jellicles tribe?</p>
      <p><i>Cats</i> arrives in theaters on Dec. 20.</p>
