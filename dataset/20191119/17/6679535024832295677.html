      <p>The Central Crime Branch (CCB), which has been probing the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) match fixing and betting scandals, has issued a notice to the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) and the management of 11 cricket teams seeking answers to questions that the investigation has thrown up.</p>
      <h3>18 questions</h3>
      <p>Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Sandeep Patil said that the role of a few team owners and coaches have been revealed during the course of investigations.</p>
      <p>“Notices containing a set of 18 questions have been issued seeking reply,” he said.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a Look out Circular had been issued to the owner of Ballari Tuskers Arvind Venkatesh Reddy. As he is abroad, a notice has been served to him to appear before us for investigation, Mr. Patil said.</p>
      <p>The CCB officials have also questioned many cricket players to ascertain their role in the spot fixing in KPL matches in the last two seasons.</p>
      <p>So far, the CCB has arrested at least eight people, including four cricketers, the owner of Belagavi Panthers, and an international bookie involved in the scandal.</p>
