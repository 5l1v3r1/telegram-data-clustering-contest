      <p>"For Sama" tells the true story of filmmaker Waad al-Kateab’s life through five years of uprising in rebel-held Aleppo, Syria. During that time, she falls in love, gets married and gives birth to her daughter, Sama, all the while filming the conflict raging around her.</p>

      <p>The documentary chronicles Sama’s first year of life at a time of unimaginable darkness. Hospitals are bombed, civilians are attacked with chlorine gas, and women and children are massacred by the Assad regime. Amid this horror, al-Kateab and Sama endure, offering a lens into the country’s war through her eyes, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>This 90-minute film captures stories of loss, survival and even joy between mother and daughter.</p>
      <p>The documentary has been honored at the Cannes Film Festival in France, South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, the British Independent Film Awards and more.</p>
