        <b>Marvell has announced Nvidia GPU support on its ThunderX family of Arm-based server processors.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following Nvidia’s June announcement to bring Cuda to the Arm architecture, Marvell has collaborated with Nvidia to port its Cuda-X AI and HPC libraries, GPU-accelerated AI frameworks and software development tools to the ThunderX platform.</p>
      <p>The computational performance and memory bandwidth of ThunderX2, Marvell’s 64-bit Armv8-A based server processor, combined with the parallel processing capabilities of Nvidia GPUs provide a path to energy-efficient exascale computing, the firm says.</p>

      <p>Marvell is initially focusing on computational science applications including GROMACS, NAMD, MILC and LAMMPS.</p>
      <p>“NVIDIA GPU support for our ThunderX2 server processor brings clear, differentiated value to meet the distinctive performance and power requirements of the exascale computing era,” said Gopal Hegde, vice president and general manager, server processor business unit at Marvell Semiconductor.</p>
      <p>“The availability of NVIDIA GPU acceleration on the Arm architecture will further expand the ThunderX2 ecosystem for HPC, cloud computing and edge markets, spurring innovation across low level firmware through system software to commercial ISV applications.”</p>
      <p>Chris Bergey, senior vice president and general manager, infrastructure line of business at Arm says “The breadth and depth of innovation across the ecosystem enables an easy migration path and robust support for existing and future GPU workloads from the edge to the cloud.”</p>
      <p>ThunderX2 boasts ecosystem of over 100 partners across commercial, open source and industry standards engagements. Nvidia’s software suite support is enabling the acceleration of 600 HPC applications and AI frameworks on ThunderX2 systems.</p>
      <p>“Our collaboration with Marvell enables us to support servers with the industry-leading performance of ThunderX2 with our SC8000 compute acceleration expansion platform, bringing data center AI capabilities to a host of edge applications,” said Steve Cooper, CEO at One Stop Systems.</p>
      <p>Marvell’s platform, with Nvidia GPU support, will be demonstrated at SC19 (the international conference for high performance computing, networking, storage and analysis), running through November 22, 2019 in Denver, Colorado.</p>
