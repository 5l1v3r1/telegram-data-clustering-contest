      <h1>Talks continue between RMT and South Western Railway over December strikes</h1>

      <p>Crunch negotiations between RMT union and South Western Railway took place today, in a bid to avert 27 days of strikes over the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Union bosses and the rail franchise are still clashing over a dispute involving the role of guards on trains.</p>
      <p>Drivers and guards will strike from 2 December until the New Year, only stopping for a brief period around the General Election on 12 December and for Christmas Day and Boxing Day, when trains do not run anyway.</p>
      <p>Downing Street has called the action “unacceptable”.</p>
      <p>Negotiations are taking place under the watchful eye of Acas, the conciliation service, in a bid to find an agreement.</p>
      <p>The union says every train needs a guard as well as a driver, but South Western has refused to give it the assurances it wants that this will be the case in the coming years.</p>
      <p>RMT says the guard is important to help disabled people onto trains and to help keep passengers safe.</p>
      <p>However, South Western has said RMT is making a “misguided attempt to hold power over the industry”.</p>
      <p>Mick Cash, the RMT’s general secretary, said: “We enter into these talks in good faith as always, and the trade union will not be providing a running commentary.”</p>
