      <p>With so much going on in the Liverpool City Region over the festive period, there’s really only one way to travel - by bus of course. </p>
      <p>Apart from the obvious environmental benefits of travelling by bus, such as over 70 per cent of air pollution being caused by cars and the fact that one double decker bus takes 75 cars off the road. </p>
      <p>There’s also the added bonus of Bustle, Arriva's onboard, free entertainment system which is streamed straight to your personal device. Enjoy audiobooks, games, podcasts, eBooks and more. There is no fuss, no app downloads, simply access Arriva's free on-board Wi-Fi, and not forgetting contactless payment options and no paying for parking.</p>
      <p>Arriva is the first bus operator in the UK to offer a media entertainment service to passengers. It’s another way in which the company is continuing to invest in its service to provide you with better journeys.</p>
      <p>This festive season has so much going on and because Arriva don’t want you to miss a single minute of it, its on-demand transport service is perfect.</p>

      <p>Arriva Click is available in central and south Liverpool and really is as easy as a click. The app based travel portal uses GPS to find where you are, before you tell the app where you want to go.</p>
      <p>A luxurious Arriva Click vehicle then comes straight to you, and with leather seats, heating and AC available, as well as USB charging points, what's not to love?</p>
      <p>Christmas is the season of traditions and if you love the bus, then the Arriva Bus app will help you to get the most out of your Arriva local bus services right across the north west. Find the time of the next bus, the nearest bus stop, which bus to catch, and lots more. You can even get real time updates.</p>
      <p>Enjoy everything the City Region has to offer this festive period by travelling via bus.</p>
