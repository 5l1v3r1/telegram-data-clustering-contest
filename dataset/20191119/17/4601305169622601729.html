      <p>C4D4U's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrqy2qnoFcE">SOFTBODY TETRIS V16</a> is (as the name implies), the latest in a series of "softbody" simulations of Tetris, in which the tetronimoes are rubbery, jelly-like solids that glisten as they wobble into place. It's an incredibly soothing thing to watch (C4D4U calls them "ASMR for my eyes") and part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_s93nfcRwn0gGHkn_0CGag">wider genre</a> of softbody sims. <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">JWZ argues</a> that this "becomes intolerable" upon the "realization that completed rows don't liquify" but if that's your thing, you need <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9j62lkqRaQ">SOFTBODY TETRIS V9</a>.</p>
