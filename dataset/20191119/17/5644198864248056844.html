      <p>“Yesterday, as assisted by the university staff, our officers entered the campus for evidence gathering and disposal of dangerous goods. (More than) 3,900 petrol bombs were seized, which is the highest number recorded in one single location.</p>
      <p>“I’m saddened to report that CUHK has become a manufacturing base for petrol bombs."</p>

      <p>The stolen chemicals include “concentrated acid”, he said, adding that they were "ingredients for making petrol bombs."</p>
      <p>The police spokesperson also warned the chemicals were "highly corrosive and toxic" and close contact with them can lead to "long-lasting and even permanent nerve damage".</p>
