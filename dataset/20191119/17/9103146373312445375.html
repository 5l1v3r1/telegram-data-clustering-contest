      <p><b>“The clock is ticking, and your work and commitment to the people of South Sudan is clear and much needed,” an official said. <br/></b><b>JUBA:</b> A two-day joint workshop convened by IGAD, RJMEC, the AU Commission and CTSAMVM for the Revitalized Peace Agreement security mechanisms came to a close on Tuesday, 19th November 2019. <br/> <br/>The workshop was aimed at agreeing on a roadmap with clear timelines for the implementation of the Transitional Security Arrangements within the one hundred (100) days extension of the Pre-Transitional period. <br/> <br/>Speaking during the closing ceremony in Juba, RJMEC Interim Chairperson H.E. Ambassador Lt. Gen. Augostino Njoroge said: <br/> <br/>“All of us know that time is against us, and this should keep us focused on achieving the tasks that have unfortunately held up the formation of the RTGoNU (Revitalized Government of National Unity) on a solid foundation.” <br/> <br/>“The clock is ticking, and your work and commitment to the people of South Sudan is clear and much needed,” he said.  <br/> <br/>On budget and financial constraints facing the implementation of key Pre-Transitional tasks, Amb. Lt. Gen. Njoroge said: “I would like to remind all of you of the need to fine-tune your budgets and keep them realistic, and to implement activities according to principles of transparency and accountability.”  <br/> <br/>Amb. Lt. Gen. Njoroge repeated his call on the government to release the necessary funding “so that the plans deliberated at this workshop can be put into action without any delay.”  <br/> <br/>“One day without funding is one day wasted, and surely the release of funds is a strong indicator of political will,” he said.  <br/> <br/><b>Related stories</b></p>
