      <p><b>Muscat: </b>In an exclusive event for media personalities, Huawei unveiled the Huawei Y9s, its latest entry-level smartphone that boasts both a modern aesthetic design and outstanding specifications making it the flagship phone in the entry-level market sector.<br/><br/>Equipped with an ultra wide angle 48MP AI Triple Camera to deliver outstanding photography, the Huawei Y9s also features a 6.59-inch HD FullView display and perfectly integrated front-facing pop-up camera for a boundary-free viewing experience.<br/><br/>With looks to match the outstanding specifications, the Huawei Y9s’ design is inspired by the concept of ‘time aesthetics’. Available in two styles; ‘Breathing Crystal’ and ‘Midnight Black’ the Huawei Y9s combines nature’s beauty with modern craftsmanship in a stylish design that sets a new standard for entry-level smartphones aesthetics.<br/><br/><b>Leading camera system</b></p>
      <p>The device is equipped with a 48MP Main Camera, an 8MP Ultra Wide Angle Camera and a 2MP Depth Camera. Huawei’s powerful AI algorithms offer intelligent features including 3D Portrait Lighting, AI Beauty for portraits, AI Scene Recognition up to 22 scenarios and more than 500 scenes, as well as Handheld Night mode that allows long exposures of up to six seconds to be taken. For low-light environments, the Handheld Night mode enables image stabilisation to deliver high-quality night photography.<br/><br/>Upfront, the Huawei Y9s houses an Auto pop-up 16MP AI Selfie Camera, that comes up smoothly from the top edge when the selfie mode is turned on. Packing powerful features and AI powered software, this front camera is able to create photos with better lighting thanks to the HDR Backlit selfie feature, while the AI scene recognition can recognise up to 8 scenes and optimize the settings required. Users can also enjoy studio-like effects with the 3D Portrait Lighting feature.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The device sports a 6.59-inch LCD display (2340x1080) that brings out the fine details and makes on-screen colours look more vibrant. Together with a micro-seam earpiece embedded into the top bezel and an ambient light sensor installed at the bottom, the front pop-up camera allows the display to have even thinner bezels while retaining the integrity of the display. Additionally, the Huawei Y9s has a high screen-to-body ratio with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9, maximising the viewing area. When the screen is on, it offers a clear, clean and unobstructed view. When the screen is off, both top and bottom bezels "disappear”, looking like a boundary-free black mirror.<br/><br/>In addition, the Huawei Y9s cares for users’ eyes with an Eye Comfort Mode that provides a more comfortable reading experience. Additionally, the screen is certified by TÜV Rheinland to block out harmful blue light. With the help of Huawei’s sunlight display and video display enhancement technologies, the device can intelligently adjust screen brightness based on the ambient lighting to deliver comfortable viewing experience.<br/><br/><b>Glass made back panel</b><br/><br/>Echoing the mirror-like qualities of the front of the device, the back panel plays with light and shadows. Alongside the classic Midnight Black version, the ‘Breathing Crystal’ design is inspired by the ethereal visuals of salt flats, capturing the dreamy effects and engraves them on the back of a smartphone.<br/><br/>Huawei Y9s uses a glass-made back panel to fully exploit the charms of craftsmanship and aesthetics. The dazzling back panel is crafted with nano-texture process (Breathing Crystal only) and has a 21-layer glass polishing process. In addition, the 3D Arc designed middle frame create a natural and streamlined transition from the back panel to the front display while providing a more comfortable grip.<br/><br/>The Huawei Y9s also adopts a side-fingerprint design, which combines the power and fingerprint unlock button in one. This feature ensures the integrity of the front and back panels, allowing users to use one button for multiple purposes.<br/><br/>The Huawei Y9s is powered by the Kirin 710F chip running EMUI9.1. It delivers high performance with low power consumption for a smooth user experience. Its 6GB+128GB storage is fully realised with support for the UFS2.1 Dual-channel Storage and Huawei’s powerful Extendable Read-Only File System (EROFS) technology, giving users more room to take pictures and videos and listen to music. It also packs a large battery of 4000mAh (typical value) so users don’t have to worry about running out of battery during daily use. Additionally, the Huawei Y9s also comes with GPU Turbo 3.0 which enhances graphics during gameplay for a more immersive gaming experience.<br/><br/>As a new addition to Huawei’s entry-level lineup, Huawei Y9s offers a captivating mix of features and superb performance. With the perfect blend of quality craftsmanship, the Huawei Y9s takes entry-level devices into a new aesthetic era.<br/><br/>Available in Midnight Black and Breathing Crystal, the devices are available for pre-order at the Huawei Experience Store located at City Centre Muscat on 21st November 2019.</p>
