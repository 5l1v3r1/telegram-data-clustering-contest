      <h1>Mark Dantonio Was Asked If He’ll Be Michigan State’s Coach In 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:18:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>In what has been an almost constant theme over the last four seasons, Michigan State head coach Mark Dantonio is facing strong criticism from his team’s fan base.</p>
      <p>The Spartans are 4-6 and need to win their last two games against Rutgers and Maryland to have a shot at reaching a bowl game. Many fans of the Green and White are calling for their longtime head coach to be fired.</p>
      <p>Since reaching the College Football Playoff during the 2015 season, Dantonio has steered MSU to a .500 record over its last 48 games (24-24). The mediocrity he was able to drive out of East Lansing has returned.</p>
      <p>It seems unlikely that Michigan State would fire Dantonio because of his overall record of achievement and <a href="https://twitter.com/HondoCarpenter/status/1195801978284064769?s=20">his connection to AD</a> Bill Beekman. Dantonio stepping down would seem like a more likely option.</p>
      <p>Still, when asked by the media today if he plans on coaching next season, Dantonio said yes.</p>

      <p>Of course, Dantonio could be planning to retire and just has to say this to avoid causing a stir. We’ll find out once the season ends.</p>
      <p>However, if Dantonio is back on the sidelines next fall, it will be interesting to see if he was forced to make major staff changes after refusing to do so following last season.</p>
