      <p>“Weaves”, a textile fair to be held in Erode from November 27 to 30, is looking at attracting more number of overseas buyers.</p>
      <p>Over 60 foreign visitors and representatives of several multi-national companies that have offices in India are expected to visit the second edition of the event.</p>
      <p>“We have conducted road shows across the country and met officials in other countries. Only when we get more foreign buyers will the quality of the products (made here) go up,” said C. Devarajan, vice-chairman of Texvalley. The aim of the exhibition was to showcase the capabilities of the textile industry in this region to national and global buyers, he added. “We expect totally 10,000 visitors.”</p>
      <p>The second edition of “Weaves” is expected to generate nearly ₹1,000-crore business enquiry as against ₹400 crore last year. Texvalley, a permanent market place in Erode for textile sector, has 750 permanent stalls.</p>
      <p>The participants at the expo will include griege (unprocessed) fabric manufacturers, made-up and garment producers, traders, and weavers, and also about 30 handloom weavers. It will have seminars on all the four days. The visitors can book bulk orders and the participants have capacities to cater to those orders. The venue will have lounges for meetings.</p>
      <p>Texvalley offers a host of services to its occupiers and members such as helping them modernise looms, cluster development, training in packing and displaying products. The aim is to offer solutions such as banking, insurance and product development to those who have permanent stalls at Texvalley. The number of occupants has gone up from 350 during the same period last year to 750 now. “We are looking at about 900 occupants. We help weavers add value to their products,” he said.</p>
