      <p>In order to manage inventories and clear stock, the automaker will stop BS4 model production by end of the calendar year.</p>
      <p>With the BS6 deadline just a little over four months away, many manufacturers have begun the rigorous process of transitioning to the cleaner emission norms, and Isuzu is the latest brand to join the queue. The company has announced that, in order to manage inventories and clear existing stock, it will stop production of BS4 models by end-December 2019.</p>
      <p>The Japanese automaker has also stated that, with the switch to BS6 thereafter, its entire model range is set to witness a substantial mark up. Ex-showroom prices of passenger vehicles, including the D-Max V-Cross pickup and MU-X SUV, are expected to shoot up by Rs 3-4 lakh, while those of commercial models such as the D-Max Regular Cab and D-Max S-Cab are set to rise by Rs 1-1.5 lakh. It is important to remember that Isuzu’s entire line-up is powered by diesel engines, which are more cumbersome to update to the new emission norms compared to petrol powertrains, thus leading to the steep rise in prices.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the issue, the company’s spokesperson, Shankar Srinivas, said, “There is an air of uncertainty prevailing amongst vehicle buyers in the country. As per the government announcement, BS4 vehicles purchased on or before March 31, 2020, will continue to run even after implementation of BS6 norms coming in force from April 2020. Isuzu would like to notify its new and existing customers about the price hike next year and urge its customers to make appropriate vehicle purchase decisions whilst availing scheme benefits that come with the range of Isuzu utility vehicles.”</p>
      <p>The D-Max V-Cross is the company’s full-size pickup that is available in India in only a double-cab form. One of the most sophisticated offerings of its kind in our market, the V-Cross pickup is known for its commendable load-carrying abilities and tough-as-nails character. It comes with a 136hp, 2.5-litre diesel-manual combination in the lower trims and a stronger 150hp, 1.9-litre diesel-auto powertrain in the higher variants, with a standard-fit four-wheel-drive layout. The India-spec V-Cross received a facelift earlier this year that brought with it spruced up styling and more equipment. Moreover, last month, the Japanese automaker also revealed an <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/all-new-isuzu-d-max-revealed-414479"><b>all-new iteration of the D-Max</b></a> with significant updates for global markets, though there has been no official announcement regarding an imminent India launch.</p>
      <p>Essentially Isuzu’s contender in the full-size, seven-seat SUV category, the MU-X is powered by a 177hp, 3.0-litre, four-cylinder diesel engine mated to a 5-speed automatic gearbox as standard, with a four-wheel-drive system available as an option. The body-on-frame SUV dukes it out with the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/toyota/fortuner"><b>Toyota Fortuner</b></a>, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/ford/endeavour"><b>Ford Endeavour</b></a> and <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mahindra/alturas-g4"><b>Mahindra Alturas G4</b></a> in our market.  </p>
