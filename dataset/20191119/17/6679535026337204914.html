      <h2>The third-generation politician says his father and he had never agreed to give up Hoskote seat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:58:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sharath-S-Srivatsa-777/" target="_blank">Sharath S. Srivatsa</a></address>
      <p>Hoskote, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, is set to witness an intense poll battle in the upcoming byelections. 37-year-old Independent candidate Sharath Bache Gowda has raised a banner of revolt against the BJP’s official nominee N. Nagaraju (MTB), giving anxious moments to the party’s State leadership. A third-generation politician, the U.S.-educated Mr. Sharath quit his job at transport technology major Alstom in Switzerland to join politics. In his political debut, he contested as a BJP candidate in the 2018 Assembly polls and lost to Mr. Nagaraju, who was then a Congress candidate. Excerpts.</p>
      <p>Why did you go ahead with your candidature despite pressure from the BJP?</p>
      <p>I decided to stand my ground for my voters. For six years, Hoskote constituency has not seen development. With no new factories, youth have remained unemployed. Investments have gone to other places. Also, for nearly six decades, our family has had a deep bond with the voters here. My grandfather Chennabyre Gowda and my father B.N. Bache Gowda have represented the constituency.</p>
      <p>Did you not anticipate the risk of being expelled?</p>
      <p>I cannot let down my followers. Mr. Nagaraju is a vindictive politician. In the last six years, he has troubled my followers and voters. A tough and a good decision had to be made. I am not here for power as my family’s bond with Hoskote goes beyond the party. Giving up the constituency has not been easy and I accept the decision with a heavy heart. Though the party expelled me, I am grateful towards many leaders.</p>
      <p>But party leaders, including the CM, say your family had agreed to field Mr. Nagaraju.</p>
      <p>What happened between four walls has to stay there. The question of letting go of the constituency did not arise. The statements that are coming out now are disrespectful to Mr. Bache Gowda (BJP MP). It is not true that we agreed to give up the seat.</p>
      <p>The party has threatened to take action against Mr. Bache Gowda..</p>
      <p>The decision to contest was mine. In fact, I have not been living with my parents for over a month-and-a-half since I announced my intention to contest. I am staying at my ancestral house in Bendiganahalli. My father is not backing me and he is conducting himself with dignity. He has not spoken for me in any public platform.</p>
      <p>Was it a tough decision to contest as an Independent?</p>
      <p>Absolutely. It was a painful decision and the party (BJP) expelled me. We had done a lot of ground work for the BJP since 2018. I had lost the elections by a margin of 6,000 votes. However, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the constituency gave a lead of 10,000 votes. This meant that not only had we wiped out the deficit, we had added 10,000 more votes. It hurts that our work did not get recognised.</p>
      <p>How would you describe this bypoll battle?</p>
      <p>Karnataka has become a stage for the David and Goliath fights (referring to the Mandya LS polls). I am the David here and I cannot fight my opponent with money. What I have is principle and self-respect. It’s sad that for 2 lakh votes, both national parties are fielding outsiders. I am a native of Hoskote.</p>
      <p>You have got unexpected support from JD(S)...</p>
      <p>As I am contesting as an Independent, any support is welcome. I am grateful to former CM H.D. Kumaraswamy for his support. It is also a big step as he has extended the olive branch (considering bitterness between two families).</p>
