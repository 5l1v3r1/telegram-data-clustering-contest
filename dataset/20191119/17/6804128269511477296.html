      <h1>The starting eleven changes Manuel Pellegrini could make when West Ham face Spurs</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers boss is under pressure to turn results around - starting with the visit of their bitter rivals this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini only had six of his senior West Ham players away with their countries across the international break so apart from those who are injured, the boss had had most of his squad available to work with over the past fortnight.</p>
      <p>The ones away will be returning over the next couple of days, Fabian Balbuena will likely be the last to arrive back as he plays for Paraguay on Wednesday evening but, so far, those return will seemingly do so intact and with no injury concerns.</p>
      <p>Balbuena's late arrival back may well come into the managers thinking as he prepares his team to face bitter rivals Spurs at London Stadium on Saturday lunchtime as two under pressure managers lock horns in east London.</p>
      <p>Spurs haven't won away from home since January 20 while the Hammers haven't won at all since September 22 when they swatted aside Manchester United in Stratford.</p>
      <p>That run has seen West Ham slump from fifth to 16th in the table and have the same number of wins this season as Spurs - three - who sit two places above the hosts in the table.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini's team selection has come under fire in recent weeks as the Hammers have struggled badly in the Premier League with some questionable personnel calls and tactics as well, though the latter is unlikely to chance under the rigid tactician.</p>
      <p>He's more likely to make player changes than a formation one, so what tinkering could he get up to for the visit of Mauricio Pochettino's side at the weekend?</p>

      <p>This is a big call for Pellegrini as he has to decide whether to stick with Roberto or draft in third-choice David Martin, who hasn't played a single minute of competitive football for the club.</p>
      <p>Logic dictates that, despite his recent string of gaffes, Roberto will keep the gloves with Lukasz Fabianski still on the sidelines. It might not be a popular decision but if Pellegrini does ditch Roberto then surely that's him done at West Ham, around six months into his stay.</p>
      <h3>Defence</h3>
      <p>There could be a couple of changes here should the manager choose to make them.</p>
      <p>As mentioned, Fabian Balbuena's late arrival back to east London could factor against him with a lunchtime kick off on Saturday. The centre half hasn't been in good form since he replaced Angelo Ogbonna anyway and the Italian is a serious candidate for a recall.</p>
      <p>Also at left back, Arthur Masuaku completed 180 minutes for DR Congo across the international break as he got some minutes under his belt, something he was lacking in east London in recent week.</p>
      <p>Many fans want to see a more offensive Hammers team and that fits into Masuaku's wheelhouse perfectly but it'll still be a surprise if Aaron Cresswell makes way.</p>
      <h3>Midfield</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Mark Noble suffered a sprained ankle in the lousy defeat at Burnley before the international break and is touch and go for the weekend - Pellegrini will give an update on Thursday at his pre-match press conference.</p>
      <p>Should the skipper not make it then he will be hoping that Jack Wilshere will have recovered from an injury that has seen him miss four games and is the natural replacement. Should he not be then there could be a problem with who plays with Declan Rice.</p>
      <p>It could mean Robert Snodgrass drops deeper and Pablo Fornals would start once again in the number ten role with another attacking winger, Andriy Yarmolenko most likely, coming in having been on the bench at Burnley.</p>
      <h3>Striker</h3>
      <p>Many, if not all, Hammers fans are clamouring for Sebastien Haller to have some support up front but the manager has had nearly five months of the season now and has stuck with the one up front so is it realistically going to change?</p>

      <p>Albian Ajeti played in one of two friendlies for Switzerland over the break and the boss will also give an update on Michail Antonio on Thursday, though the winger is highly unlikely to start after having such a long lay-off even if he is fit.</p>
