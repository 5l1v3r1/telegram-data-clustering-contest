      <p>Two persons have been confirmed dead in Lokoja during a bloody clash by party supporters on Monday at Ochadamu, Ofu Local Government area of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>The state Police Command’s Spokesman, DSP Willam Aya, who confirmed the development in Lokoja on Tuesday, said that a former councillor in the local government, Salome Abu and Awalu Zekeri died in the crisis.</p>
      <p>He said that crisis erupted on Monday due to a misunderstanding between Zekeri of the All Progressives Congress and Goodwin Simeon, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>“In the process, Simeon stabbed Zekeri with a knife on his lap and he died on his way to the hospital,” Aya said.</p>
      <p>As a result, angry youths in Ochadamu mobilised to the house of Simeon Abuh, who is an uncle to the suspect and set it ablaze, thereby burning 60-year-old Salome Abuh to death.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that tntil her death, Abuh woman was the woman leader of PDP in Ochadamu.</p>
      <p>Aya further said that three other houses were also burnt during the mayhem.</p>
      <p>In its reaction, the PDP condemned the killing of its woman leader by jubilant supporters of APC, calling on the police to arrest the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>Spokesman of Wada/Aro Campaiagn Organisation, Farouk Adejoh-Audu, while reacting to the incident, called on men of good conscience to prevail on the police to halt attacks on members of the PDP in the state.</p>
      <p>The state government, in its reaction, condemned the violent clashes in Ochadamu, saying that anyone caught taking the law into his hands would be punished, regardless of party affiliations.</p>
      <p>“We feel disturbed by reports of violence in Ochadamu which has led to the loss of lives and property in the community,” Kingsley Fanwo, Director-General, Media and Publicity to the Governor, said.</p>
      <p>Fanwo, who also doubles as the spokesman of Bello/Onoja Campaign Organisation, noted that government would not shield any party member, who broke the laws of the land.</p>
      <p>“Governor Yahaya Bello has directed security agents to quell the rising tension and ensure that perpetrators of the murder and arson are brought to book.</p>
      <p>“The governor is elected to protect all Kogi people, regardless of their ethnic or political beliefs,” he said. </p>
