      <p>A baby boy who was born without skin and whose eyelids were fused shut has finally gone home after a year in hospital.</p>
      <p>Ja’bari Gray was discharged from Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston last Wednesday after successful grafts of lab-grown skin.</p>
      <p>The youngster’s delighted mother Priscilla Maldonado said: ‘I’m overwhelmed with happiness.</p>
      <p>‘Everything is going fine. It’s working out a lot better than I expected.’</p>
      <p>Priscilla told <a href="https://www.today.com/health/baby-born-without-skin-texas-be-released-hospital-t164472?cid=sm_npd_td_tw_ma">Today</a> that Ja’bari has finally enjoyed skin to skin contact with her, and had his first ‘official’ bath in a regular tub at his San Antonio home last night.</p>

      <p>After Ja’bari was born in January, doctors warned he was unlikely to survive.</p>
      <p>But he has thrived, with his weight growing from three pounds to 17 pounds.</p>
      <p>Ja’bari had been due to leave hospital last month, but was kept in a little longer while doctors weaned him off pain medication.</p>
      <p>He has been treated by a huge team of medical experts, including plastic surgeons, ophthalmologists and dermatologists.</p>

      <p>Ja’bari was born by emergency cesarean section after an ultrasound showed that he was no longer gaining weight, and that his heart rate was dropping.</p>
      <p>His mother told of her fears after the newborn was ‘eerily quiet’ throughout his delivery.</p>
      <p>By the time she saw Ja’bari in Neonatal Intensive Care later that day, her son had been covered in dressings to keep his skin moisturized.</p>
      <p>The youngster had skin on his head, face and parts of his legs, but it was missing from other body parts including his chest, back, shoulders and arms.</p>
      <p>Speaking in July, Priscilla said: ‘It was just red. Bright red.</p>
      <p>‘You could see all his veins (through it), everything was exposed.’</p>
      <p>Ja’bari needed a breathing tube, painkillers and round-the-clock care.</p>
      <p>Doctors in San Antonio even wanted to switch off his life support, but Priscilla refused, and her son was moved to Houston.</p>
      <p>There, surgeons took skin cells from behind his ear, then sent them to a biopharmaceutical company in Massachusetts, which grew 12 trays of skin to cover Ja’bari’s body.</p>

      <p>They were attacked to his unprotected flesh during an operation in May.</p>
      <p>Those grafts took successfully, with all Ja’bari’s skin now covered, and the little boy breathing independently since September.</p>
      <p>Ja’bari is still fed through a tube, and requires further surgeries – with two attempts to separate the skin on his eyelids failing.</p>
      <p>But none of those issues are life-threatening, with Priscilla delighted about her son’s amazing progress.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘It feels like having a baby all over again — actually being able to take the baby home.</p>
      <p>‘It’s like a dream come true, finally.’</p>
