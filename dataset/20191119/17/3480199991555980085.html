      <p>Idris Elba appears nude in feline form and covered in brown fur in the new trailer for the Cats movie.</p>
      <p>The Luther star plays the villainous Macavity the Mystery Cat in the adaptation of the hit musical.</p>
      <p>He says “Going to the ball could get dangerous” in the trailer, before delivering a sinister laugh.</p>

      <p>He also tells Dame Judi Dench’s cat, Old Deuteronomy, that he has “plenty of soul” as she chooses the cat that deserves a new life, and the trailer shows Elba seated on top of a stone statue of a cat’s head as he kisses his hat and then disappears.</p>
      <p>The clip also offers a further look at Taylor Swift, James Corden, Jason Derulo and Sir Ian McKellen in the film.</p>
      <p>The first trailer for the highly anticipated movie drew mixed reactions, as some were left baffled by the appearance of the A-list stars.</p>
      <p>Cats, directed by The King’s Speech filmmaker Tom Hooper, employs CGI animation to graft its stars’ heads on to the bodies of bipedal felines.</p>
      <p>Based on one of the most successful musicals of all time, it features music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, who has written a new song with Swift for the film.</p>
      <p>Cats is released in UK cinemas on December 20.</p>
