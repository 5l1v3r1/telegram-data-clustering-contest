      <p><b>CARROLLTON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The fiance and daughters of a man fatally shot by an Ohio sheriff's deputy following a traffic stop said they do not understand why he had to die, a newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Authorities have identified the man shot Saturday morning in rural Carroll County as Robert Sikon III, 41, of Carrollton, which is roughly 88 miles (142 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland.</p>
      <p>The Carroll County deputy has not been identified. Carroll County Sheriff Dale Williams referred questions to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which is examining the shooting. A BCI spokesman declined to comment Tuesday about the investigation.</p>
      <p>Sikon's fiance, Jami Marcus Vinka, told The Canton Repository that she was behind the wheel of her pickup truck with Sikon in the passenger seat when the deputy pulled them over as she drove to her home.</p>
      <p>Vinka said the deputy approached the truck with his gun drawn, prompting Sikon to tell her that he was probably going to be arrested. Sikon had his hands out the window when the deputy yanked him out of the truck and slammed him against the side, Vinka said.</p>
      <p>"He was trying to cuff (Sikon) and Bobby kept turning around," Vinka said.</p>
      <p>She said Sikon wrestled with the deputy, who threatened Sikon if he didn't stop resisting. Vinka said Sikon took off running with the deputy chasing and then shooting him.</p>
      <p>Vinka said she heard numerous gunshots and that Sikon was out sight when he was killed.</p>
      <p>The newspaper reported court records show an arrest warrant was issued for Sikon in September for failing to pay child support and that he had served prison sentences for theft, forgery, and breaking and entering.</p>
      <p>Sikon's daughters say their father was not a violent man and questioned why something as minor as a warrant for non-support would have led to his being killed.</p>
      <p>"There are so many unanswered questions," Natalie Sikon said.</p>
