      <h1>What Happens On Tour: Inside Lionel Richie’s iconic Glastonbury performance</h1>

        <b>Everyone knows what to expect from a music concert. The lights go down, the audience erupts into a chorus of applause and the idolised superstar arrives on stage, bursting with energy, ready to entertain the throng of their adoring fans for one night only.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s pretty spectacular.</p>
      <p>But, ever wondered what happens once the curtains close and the lights go up? Are there diva tantrums? Catty fights between dancers? Tour riders demanding vitamin water to bathe pet <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a>? Yes Mariah, we might be looking at you for that one, girl.</p>
      <p>If you have, you’ve come to the right place as <b>Metro.co.uk</b> will give you an all-access, backstage look into what it really takes to make the tours of your favourite popstars come to life, while also reminiscing on some unique moments that made headline news.</p>
      <p>Touring is not only an experience for the performer and the fans – the backing dancers, singers, stylists and others are also very much a part of the process and, perhaps more importantly, the backbone of these mammoth shows.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>So grab your backstage pass as we get the inside scoop from <b>Lionel Richie’s manager Bruce Eskowitz</b> because, in this case, What Happens On Tour (Doesn’t) Stay On Tour…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lionel Richie drew one of the biggest crowds for his Glastonbury performance in 2015.</b>

      <p>Around 100,000 people flocked to the festival’s Pyramid Stage to watch Lionel perform in the Sunday legend slot and the rest, as they say, was history.</p>
      <p>‘What the hell is going on?’ Lionel exclaimed at one point in total shock.</p>
      <p>Even after five decades of entertaining us with his hits, it seems Glastonbury was enough to mesmerise even the legendary Lionel himself.</p>
      <p>So it’s no surprise that the iconic performance forms the basis for the film, Lionel Richie at Glastonbury, recounting the show with commentary from the singer about his humble beginnings and rise to stardom.</p>
      <p>‘Lionel would say he’s prepared his whole life for it,’ Lionel’s manager Bruce Eskowitz told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>.</p>

      <p>‘It’s not something that you just wake up and do the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in front of almost 200,000 people. When we got there, they said to him, “You know, we think it’s the largest crowd we think we’ve ever had at Glastonbury” and, there were areas people keep going called Shrinel-Richie.’</p>

      <p>Bruce recalled how it was forecast to rain buckets during Lionel’s Glasto set – major shocker for English weather – but the sun suddenly emerged from the clouds.</p>
      <p>‘It’s one of the most magical perfect days ever,’ he recalled.</p>
      <p>‘I think there’s certain performances that are epic performances, when he played when he did the closing ceremony at the Olympics, when he sang with Pavarotti, he’s done some of the most amazing things and then Glastonbury certainly ranks up there with those.’</p>
      <p>Bruce continued: ‘You know beforehand that this is going to be one of those amazing days in your life when you’re going to play in front of a large crowd of people. And it’s hard to describe, when you’re sitting there and you see this crowd that seems to go on forever.</p>
      <p>‘When you’re landing – we took a helicopter in from London, and you just begin to see the crowd from the helicopter, and you’re like, “Wow, this is going to be something else, it’s really going to be special”.’</p>

      <p>You know that you’re a pretty big deal when there’s no budget for a performance.</p>
      <p>Literally, Bruce explains that they focus less on the money and more on putting on a good show.</p>
      <p>‘I think with anything you spend what you need to spend to make sure that it’s an incredible show. And it’s not about a particular number. It’s just about, you spend what you need to spend to make sure that it becomes an epic performance,’ he admitted.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘It’s not about any particular amount. It’s just really about how do you make it great. And that’s all we ever focus on is, how do you make every performance epic, and that people come out? And there’s a real skill to being able to figure out what the right songs are and what the right order is and how to keep the crowd up, because you go from fast paced songs to ballads and it’s a real skill set to it.’</p>
      <p>So when you’re a legend performing at Glastonbury, what would one command on their tour rider?</p>

      <p>According to Bruce, Lionel keeps it simple with just water and fruit which explains why he’s able to run around the stage barely breaking a sweat as he does.</p>
      <p>‘Lionel really is incredible. He’s so easy in terms of all that he just wants to put on a great show for the fans,’ the manager said.</p>
      <p>Some might say ‘easy like a Sunday morning’ – pun very much intended.</p>
      <p>Bruce reveals that Lionel was particularly touched by one moment during his Glasto set.</p>
      <p>‘He was incredibly moved by the security breaking into a choreographed dance Dancing On The Ceiling, which really was incredible,’ he recalled.</p>
      <p>If you’ve seen Lionel in recent years, then you’ll know he loves nothing more than bantering with his live band.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Bruce admitted: ‘He’s charming, he’s fun to be with. Everybody wants to meet him. Everybody loves Lionel.</p>
      <p>‘It was an incredibly remarkable day.’</p>
