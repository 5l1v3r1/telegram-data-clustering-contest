        <b>If the sentiments of several people interviewed by the New York Times are anything to go by, Americans are already getting bored of the impeachment hearings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The hearings entered day three proper today as two top national security aides who listened to President Donald Trump’s July call with Ukraine’s president gave testimony.</p>
      <p>However, in an article entitled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/polls-media-fake-news.html">‘No One Believes Anything’: Voters Worn Out by a Fog of Political News’</a>, the NY Times talked to Americans about how they viewed the spectacle and they didn’t come across as very enthusiastic.</p>
      <p>“In upstate New York, Travis Trudell got an alert on his phone Wednesday morning telling him the impeachment hearings had started. He turned on Disney Plus instead,” states the article.</p>
      <p>A resident of Wisconsin, Jerre Corrigan, said she had “never considered watching” the hearings.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, In Idaho computer programmer Russell Memory said he would “catch up in a few weeks when the hearings were over.”</p>
      <p>Corrigan said that the media’s relentless anti-Trump narrative has created a kind of ‘Orange Man Bad’ fatigue amongst voters.</p>
      <p>“It’s harder now — they want to grab you with those headlines,” she said. “Trump did this, Trump did that. You have to go in and really research it. And I don’t think a lot of people do that.”</p>
      <p>The responses indicate that Americans are aware of the overwhelmingly likely outcome that Trump will not be impeached and that the hearings are just another attempt by Democrats to keep a cloud hovering over the president as we get closer to 2020.</p>
