      <p>In the High Flyers spotlight this week is Vicky Davies, deputy chief executive at Danske Bank and its first female executive board member in its more than 200-year history</p>
      <p>What was your first job?</p>
      <p>I worked as a barmaid in Wimbledon earning money during my holidays from studying at Cambridge University. I also worked at Barclays Bank in Wimbledon during the summer after my first year at university. I was responsible for processing cheques and back office tasks included placing statements in envelopes. Lots of manual tasks which are automated today. My first proper full time job was as a management consultant at Accenture where I worked for five years. My role was mainly based in UK but I also worked in Scandanavia and the US.</p>
      <p>What qualifications do you have?</p>
      <p>I am a certified bank director which I obtained from Institute of Banking; I studied at INSEAD in France and Singapore where I achieved my MBA with distinction and I have a first class honours degree in natural sciences from Cambridge University.</p>
      <p>What do you attribute your success to?</p>
      <p>Hard work, great mentors, supportive family, going outside my comfort zone, getting feedback and acting on it.</p>
      <p>How would you describe yourself to someone who'd never met you?</p>
      <p>Determined, hard-working, team player, curious, inclusive and committed to driving diversity at every opportunity.</p>
      <p>Who do you look up to in business?</p>
      <p>There are so many! I'm surrounded by supportive and charismatic mentors whom I have learnt a lot from throughout my career.</p>
      <p>How do you get the best out of people who work for you?</p>
      <p>I'm proud to have great colleagues at Danske Bank and I place great importance on teamwork when leading, and being part of, a team. A shared vision, creating a supportive culture and constant encouragement are key.</p>
      <p>If you could change one thing about doing business in Northern Ireland, what would it be?</p>
      <p>Be more diverse in every way. I am truly committed to equality and diversity. I am the first female executive board member of Danske Bank in its more than 200-year history and I am chair of Danske Bank's equality and diversity initiative.</p>
      <p>What website or app could you not do without?</p>
      <p>LinkedIn – great for business news and staying connected.</p>
      <p>What was the last book you read?</p>
      <p>The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It's Broken</p>
      <p>What car do you drive?</p>
      <p>Volvo. It's a lovely family car and there's plenty of room for the dog.</p>
      <p>Tell us something interesting about yourself?</p>
      <p>I'm mum to four energetic boys ranging in age from 8 to 12 – the youngest two are twins – and we recently added a Cavapoo puppy, Barney, to our brood!</p>
      <p>What's your greatest passion outside work and family?</p>
      <p>Playing tennis (badly) and mentoring entrepreneurs and individuals embarking on their careers. I am passionate about bringing out the best in people to reach their potential in helping them think through the barriers and feeling they can go for it and achieve.</p>
