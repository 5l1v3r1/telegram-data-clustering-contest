      <h1>Heartbroken Rashami Desai backstabbed by Mahira Sharma and Paras Chhabra on Bigg Boss as Salman Khan’s prophecy comes true</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:03:46+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>Days ago when Indian TV’s popular daughter-in-law, Rashami Desai, faced the shock elimination, Bigg Boss host Salman Khan had lashed out at her for supporting Paras Chhabra leading to Mahira Sharma enjoying immunity despite polling the least number of votes. Days later, after Rashami was allowed re-entry in the house, she had to face the music from Salman once again for not learning from her past mistakes. Angry Salman had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/omg-did-salman-khan-just-reveal-that-rashami-desai-will-be-evicted-from-bigg-boss-again/272795/">warned her saying</a> that the ‘life doesn’t give you a second chance.’ Salman’s prophecy came true on Monday night when Rashami fell victim to backstabbing from her ‘friends’ Paras and Mahira, who refused to protect her from this week’s nominations.</p>

      <p>The rejection by two contestants who she had considered her friends left Rashami inconsolable as she confronted both Paras and Mahira complaining about their backstabbing. What caused Rashami even bigger heartache was the lack of remorse shown by Mahira and Paras. Paras too appeared to side with Mahira as he attempted to pull Devoleena Bhatatcharjee away from Rashami.</p>
      <p>Rashami and Devoleena were heard referring to Salman Khan’s warning to not trust Paras and Mahira and play the game intelligently. But, going by this week’s nominations, it seems Rashami has real reasons to worry since she will be facing eviction along with Siddharth Shukla, Aarti Singh, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, and Khesari Lal Yadav this week.</p>
      <p>Monday night also saw Shefali Jariwala and Devoleena compete with each other in a ‘thief’ task. The task entailed both of them stealing housemates’ belongings with the contestant stealing the most number of goods to be declared the winner. Shefali won the task and was rewarded with a pool-side party, where she invited Siddharth, Himanshi Khurana, Hindustani Bhau, Aarti Singh and Asim Riaz. While they partied in the lawn and enjoyed delicious food, the rest of the housemates looked at them helplessly.</p>
      <p>In the end, Shefali and her friends jumped in the pool and danced to romantic Bollywood music.</p>
