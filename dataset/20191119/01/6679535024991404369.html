      <p>Responding to BJP candidate Anand Singh’s mass mobilisation during the filing of his nomination papers in the Vijayanagar Assembly constituency in Hosapete on Monday, Basavaraj Rayaraddi, a Congress leader, said that mass mobilisation and the use of traditional music instruments did not necessarily mean that the BJP was a stronger party in the constituency.</p>
      <p>Speaking to media representatives, Mr. Rayaraddi asserted that the Congress was strong enough to defeat Mr. Singh with a comfortable margin.</p>
      <p>“The BJP is already questioning the legitimacy of the Congress candidate by branding him an outsider. It shows how the party is afraid of our strength. The Ghorpade family has strived for the development of the entire Ballari district, including Vijayanagar constituency. It has established industries and educational institutions all over the district and given jobs to thousands of people,” he said, justifying the candidature of Venkatarao Ghorpade.</p>
      <p>Since Mr. Ghorpade’s candidature was finalised at the eleventh hour, he appeared to be unprepared for filing his nomination papers. Just as the Congress leadership showed him the green signal, he began preparations on Monday morning. He himself went to a computer centre in Hosapete and got the documents prepared.</p>
      <p>“District Block Congress president H.N. Mohmad Imam Niazi was on the top of the Congress ticket aspirants list. However, as per the directions of the party leadership, I have filed the nomination papers. Mr. Niazi will work for me during campaigning. His sacrifice would surely earn him a better position in the party in the future,” Mr. Ghorpade said.</p>
