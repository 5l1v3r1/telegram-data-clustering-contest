      <p>Both the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077314317-india-and-china-are-two-great-countries-with-common-interests-in-good-relationship-indian-minister/">Indian and the Chinese</a> side will send 130 troops to take part in the 8th India and China joint military exercises - 'Hand in Hand' - focusing on counter-terrorism operations, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Monday on the first day of the parliament's Winter Session.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the annual exercise was held in China's Chengdu city, in which 100 troops participated.</p>
      <blockquote>The exercise did not take place in 2017 due to a 72-day standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in Doklam - a tri-junction at the border of India, Bhutan and China.  </blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201911141077304091-india-china-agree-to-hold-talks-on-trade-deficit-asap-days-after-modi-opted-out-of-rcep/">standoff brought a drastic</a> change in ties between the two countries, which later normalised following the disengagement of the standoff in August of 2018.</p>
      <blockquote>The exercise comes in the backdrop of India facing opposition from China on the issue of declaring Ladakh a separate territory, which Beijing claims undermines “China’s territorial sovereignty by unilaterally changing its domestic law”.</blockquote>
      <p>On 13 November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the 11th <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911171077330107-aware-of-likely-china-tilt-india-will-engage-with-sri-lanka-carefully-ex-diplomats-say/">BRICS summit</a> in Brasilia. The leaders noted that Special Representatives will meet again regarding the so-called boundary question and reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and security in border areas.</p>
