      <p>STEVENSON RANCH, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A young girl died and another was critically injured after a car crash Monday morning in Stevenson Ranch.<br/><br/>The CHP says the woman driving the car was naked when she got into two separate collisions.<br/><br/>Two girls, ages 6 and 2, were in the back seat without seat belts on. Good Samaritans removed them from the wreckage as it caught on fire, officials said.<br/><br/>The first crash happened in the area of The Old Road south of Pico Canyon Road just before 9:45 a.m.<br/><br/>Investigators say the woman continued driving after the first accident, then ran a red light and struck a power pole at the intersection of The Old Road and Pico Canyon.<br/><br/>The 6-year-old girl later died. The 2-year-old was initially listed in critical condition and later was said to be stable.<br/><br/>The woman is in stable condition.<br/><br/>Initially authorities believed the woman is the mother of the two girls, but that relationship has not been confirmed at this point.<br/><br/>Investigators are looking into whether alcohol was a factor in the crashes.</p>
