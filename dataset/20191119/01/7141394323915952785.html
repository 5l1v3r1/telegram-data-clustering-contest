      <h1>Bitcoin (BTC) Countdown: Analyst Spotlights Four Stark Outcomes for the World’s Most Popular Cryptocurrency</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:00:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Crypto analyst and economist Alex Krüger just released a poll on four potential outcomes for Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>The results are a snapshot of the crypto community on Twitter and highlights how people think things may play out for Bitcoin – after years of volatile price swings, regulatory uncertainty, bans, critics, supporters, new platforms, on-ramps and developers.</p>
      <p>Although three of the possible outcomes are bullish, Krüger’s fourth and final outcome centers on the risky nature of trading in the emerging and extremely volatile market.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Four long-term bitcoin scenarios:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>#1 Bitcoin becomes a global reserve currency. Current hodlers, all proven to be early, get immensely rich.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>#2 Scarcity keeps price going up forever. Bitcoin continues to outperform. Investors do extraordinarily well.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>#3 After a few more epic runs $BTC eventually matures and settles into a wide range, like most commodities do (in real-terms). Bitcoin maxis turn into goldbugs 2.0.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>#4 Bitcoin dumps into oblivion. People keep on buying the dip. Bitcoiners get REKT.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Optimism rules. Out of more than 4,500 votes, 47% chose the third scenario as the top pick: a happy ending where Bitcoiners become next-generation goldbugs as the world’s most popular cryptocurrency settles into a range.</p>
      <p>Of those who selected the third scenario, 45% also bullishly predict that Bitcoin’s settling range will be above $100,000, <a href="https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1195800245059424256">compared to 15%</a> who think Bitcoin’s settling range will ultimately dip below $15,000.</p>
      <p>Pessimism quickly follows. Bitcoin dumping into oblivion nabbed second place with 20% of respondents, followed by Bitcoin’s scarcity pushing its price up forever.</p>
