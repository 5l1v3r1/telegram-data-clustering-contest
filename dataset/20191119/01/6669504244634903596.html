      <p>Gas prices are have been dropping in Kamloops and the Okanagan, most noticeably in Penticton.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/">Gasbuddy.com</a> reports today, Nov. 18, prices are down 22 cents from last month’s average in Penticton, where a litre of regular gasoline is selling for $112.9.</p>
      <p>That compares with $120.9 in Kelowna, where prices are down six cents a litre from last month’s average.</p>
      <p>Vernon’s price is also down six cents over last month’s average at $123.9.</p>
      <p>The Kamloops market has noticed the most negligible drop, down just two cents from last month’s average at $119.9.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gaspricewizard?lang=en">Gas Price Wizard</a> analyst Dan McTeague said with taxes in, most stations in the Okanagan are paying $115.0 to replace the fuel they are selling.</p>
      <p>“It’s something of a gas war and drivers are actually doing quite well. Not sure if it will last, as $122.9 would be more in keeping with gas bars not losing their shirts,” McTeague said in an email.</p>
      <p>According to Gasbuddy.com, the lowest recorded price for a litre of gas in local markets since 2008 ranges from a low of 74.6 cents a litre in Kamloops on Dec. 15, 2008, to 89.7 cents a litre in Vernon on Feb. 16, 2016.</p>
      <p>Penticton and Kelowna recorded their lowest average price of 75.9 cents a litre in December 2008.</p>
      <p>This lowest average price last year for a litre of gas in the Thompson-Okanagan was $108.9 in Kamloops, $112.9 in Vernon, $117.9 in Kelowna and $105.9 in Penticton.</p>
