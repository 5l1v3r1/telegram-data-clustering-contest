        <b>Snapchat will keep the 6-second non-skip format, but video ads can now run up to 3 minutes with extended play.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You are about to experience longer video ads on <a href="https://wersm.com/category/other/snapchat-other/">Snapchat</a>. The company has announced it launched the new ad format in close beta.</p>
      <p>The extended play ad unit is very similar to YouTube TrueView ads. Ads can run for up to 3 minutes on the platform but users retain the ability to skip the ads at any time after the first 6 seconds.</p>
      <p>For Snapchat, 6-second ads have been a huge success. However Snap believes that extended play will provide something new that advertisers have been looking for on the platform: the ability to tell longer stories. And for the company, that means a chance to gain more market share.</p>
      <p>Snapchatâ€™s extended play is available in closed beta for whitelisted advertisers. Brands can request access via their sales representatives or by reaching out to support via <a href="https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/">Ads Manager</a>.</p>
