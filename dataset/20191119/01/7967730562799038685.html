      <h1>One of the first-ever Queensland rego plates sell for record $363,000</h1>

      <p>The registration plates given to Queensland's ninth registered car owner in 1921 have become the most expensive Queensland plates to ever sell at an Australian auction house.</p>
      <p>The Q9 set was bought on Sunday for a record $363,000 at Donington Auctions in Melbourne. There were more than 180 interested bidders in the room, on the phone and watching online.</p>

      <p>On July 1, 1921, a Brisbane man by the name of Victor William Croston had the Q9 plates fitted to his Hupmobile, an American-built motor vehicle whose manufacturer went bankrupt in 1940.</p>
      <p>The plates were purchased by the current owner at the Great Queensland Plate Auction in 1985, and since then, they have been attached to a range of vehicles during their 34 years of ownership.</p>
      <p>This was only the second time the Q9 plates had appeared on the market in their 97-year history and they smashed the previous record for Queensland's most expensive plates by more than $120,000.</p>
      <p>The winning bidder was a private collector in the room, who prevailed after a five-minute bidding battle with a phone bidder.</p>
      <p>Donington Auctions director Robbie Richards said the emergence of such rare plates on the market had triggered owners of other rare registration plates to inquire about selling theirs as well.</p>
      <p>"They come up very rarely and because they are so revered, they often stay with collectors for decades and families for generations and they are passed down to people," he said.</p>
      <p>"People realised they might only get one opportunity to purchase these plates in their lifetime.</p>
      <p>"We had private collectors [at the auction] with strong bids â€“ these people realised the owner had had them since 1985 and if they missed their chance this time, they may not get another bite."</p>
      <p>The winning bidder, who did want to be identified, also got the Department of Transport and Main Roads' accompanying certificate of registration from 1921 with his purchase.</p>
