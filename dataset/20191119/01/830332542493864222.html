      <p>WASHINGTON (CNN) - President Donald Trump's reelection campaign ran more than 6,000 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/facebook-trump-impeachment/index.html">Facebook ads mentioning impeachment</a> during the first week of public hearings in the inquiry, according to an analysis of ad data.</p>
      <p>The ads -- which could have cost up to $1 million -- highlight <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/social-media-impeachment-hearing/index.html">the unique role social media is playing in America's first impeachment hearings</a> in the age of viral politics.</p>
      <p>The campaign ran 6,286 ads mentioning impeachment from November 11 to Sunday, according to data analyzed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. According to Edelson, the buy cost between $300,000 and $1 million.</p>
      <p>Many of the ads dub the hearings the "impeachment hoax."</p>
      <p>On Monday, as the second week of public hearings was set to begin, the Trump campaign launched ads seeking donations, some of which read, "The Impeachment Hearings today are a TOTAL SCAM! Let's raise $3 MILLION in 24 HRS to send a message!!" The ads included pictures of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, both California Democrats.</p>
      <p>The Trump campaign is the biggest ad-buyer on Facebook among the 2020 presidential contenders, spending more than $15 million on the platform since January.</p>
      <p>The biggest Democratic spender is Tom Steyer, who has dropped almost $12 million on Facebook ads since January. The Steyer campaign spent up to $164,000 on ads mentioning impeachment last week.</p>
      <p>Other candidates trail far behind Trump and Steyer in Facebook ad spending -- South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Peter Buttgieg has spent $5.5 million since January, followed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at $4.4 million and Bernie Sanders of Vermont with $4.3 million.</p>
