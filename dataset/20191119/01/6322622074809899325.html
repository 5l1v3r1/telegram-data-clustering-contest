      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: GD Express Carrier Bhd’s (GDex) net profit shrank 26.44% to RM4.76 million in the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (1QFY20), from RM6.47 million in the same period last year, due to margin squeeze.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share, accordingly, were down to 0.08 sen, from 0.12 sen, a filing with Bursa Malaysia showed.</p>
      <p>GDex attributed the narrower profit margin to investment into human capital to build a stronger regional team, investment in information technology (IT) and other infrastructure. The company also blamed increasingly intense competition to lower pricing to win market share, as another factor.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue, however, grew 11.45% to RM83.04 million from RM74.51 million, on increase in demand for courier services for both its B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business-to-consumer) segments.</p>
      <p>On prospects, the group is proactive and will continue to invest in human capital, IT infrastructure and regional expansion towards a commitment to a strong intra-Asean delivery network.</p>
      <p>“This will ensure the growth and sustainability of the business, despite intense competitive environment in the industry,” GDex said, adding that the group remains focused on maintaining the growth of B2B and B2C segments, with a more customer-centric approach, to win market share.</p>
      <p>Shares in GDex dropped 0.5 sen or 1.79% at 28.5 sen yesterday, valuing the company at RM1.61 billion.</p>
