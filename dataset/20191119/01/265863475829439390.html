      <h1>KUWK: North West Rocks Septum Ring At Sunday Service – Check Out The Pic!</h1>

      <p>It looks like North West is already developing her style and has a lot of personality for a child her age! That being said, the daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West was photographed at a Sunday Service this weekend looking her best in an outfit complete with a very interesting accessory when it comes to the setting as well as her age – a nose ring!</p>
      <p>The 6-year-old girl looked over the moon about the weekly event as the whole family attended Joel Osteen’s service at Lakewood Church!</p>
      <p>The child smiled brightly but what attracted everyone’s attention was something else that was even shinier – it was, of course, the nose jewelry she was rocking.</p>
      <p>It managed to also complement her clothing choices perfectly!</p>
      <p>North was wearing a gi-inspired ensemble – was she going to Karate training after?</p>

      <p>While it’s not completely out of the question that Kim and Kanye allowed their oldest child to get a septum piercing, chances are it’s actually fake since she’s still way too young to get something pierced (other than her ears.)</p>
      <p>This would not even be the first time that she wears a fake septum ring.</p>
      <p>Last summer while at great-grandmother Mary Jo Campbell’s birthday party, the child also had a nose ring on and in a post Kim shared at the time, she made sure to clarify it was not real by writing: ‘Fake nose ring alert!!!’</p>
      <p>In other words, the mom-shaming keyboard warriors can rest assured – North has not pierced her septum as of yet!</p>
      <p>Maybe when she grows up, given how much she seems to love this kind of accessory, she’ll get it for real!</p>
      <p>At the same time, it’s likely that she’ll get bored of it by then or have her style change completely.</p>
      <p>Are you a fan of North with a nose ring or not?</p>
