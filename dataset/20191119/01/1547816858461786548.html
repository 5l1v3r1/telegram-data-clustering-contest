Ira Khan who has grabbed the attention ever since she has announced her directorial debut with a theatre play, Euripides 'Medea" which is a Greek tragedy and talking about her journey, here’s a lot to know! Talking about why she chose to mark her debut with Medea, Ira says, “I wanted to direct a story where I feel like I will be able to tell something specific. I like this play because I wanted to tell the story in my way.”</p>
      <p>Elaborating on what enticed her towards the classic tale of Medea, Ira shares, “I find Greek mythology interesting and dramatic. These myths are absurd. I always knew that if I want to do a play, then I would do a Classical story. And when I started the process, I really liked Medea because it is still relevant; we do see such cases happening even today”, who has been a student of Greek tragedy and German literature and has a special interest in Classical literature. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/aamir-khan-s-daughter-ira-khan-recent-silly-and-scary-photos-are-proof-that-a-stylist-is-important-during-photoshoots/5dcd24ce87fb571eff7e3dba">ALSO READ: Aamir Khan’s Daughter Ira Khan's Recent Silly And Scary Photos Are Proof That A Stylist Is Important During Photoshoots</a></p>
