      <p>The days of the infamous notch seem numbered as more and more manufacturers are gravitating towards other alternatives to house the front-facing sensors on smartphones. Several manufacturers like OnePlus and Xiaomi have added pop-up camera modules on their smartphones to achieve the seamless no-bezel look, while others like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-a51-renders-show-48mp-quad-rear-cameras-punch-hole-display/">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-nova-6-render-reveals-dual-punch-hole-display-like-galaxy-s10/">Huawei</a> have opted for punch-hole displays to house the front-facing sensor. The punch-hole display seems to have caught on quite well and we already have quite a few devices featuring the same. In fact, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-8-punch-hole-display-triple-cameras-leak/">leaks reveal</a> that the next flagship from OnePlus will also feature a punch-hole display. Huawei’s sub-brand Honor already offers a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-view20-review/">couple of smartphones</a> with the design and it doesn’t seem like the company’s going to stop any time soon.</p>

      <p>As per a recent post on Weibo, Honor will be launching the all-new Honor V30 in China on November 26 and the device will feature a dual punch-hole display like the one found on the Galaxy S10 Plus. This means that the upcoming smartphone will house two selfie-shooters within the cutout on the display.</p>

      <p>As of now, there’s no information from the company regarding any of its hardware specifications, but the post does reveal that the Honor V30 will feature 5G support. The company has also released two promotional posters of the upcoming device and from the looks of it, the Honor V30 will have quite a substantial chin at the bottom. The Honor V30 is the direct successor to the Honor V20 from last year and it’s expected to offer flagship specifications at a competitive price. The device will most likely be released in international markets early next year under the View 30 moniker.</p>

      <p>We now have another look at the upcoming Honor V30/View 30, thanks to leaked press renders shared by 91mobiles. The renders confirm that the upcoming flagship from Honor will feature a pill-shaped cutout in the top left corner of the display housing two selfie shooters. On the back, the device will feature a rectangular camera module, featuring triple rear cameras and an LED flash. Additionally, the Honor V30 will ship with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner and a USB Type-C port at the bottom for charging and data syncing. Sadly, the device won’t feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. The Honor V30 will be available in at least two color variants — blue and orange — with a slight gradient finish.</p>
