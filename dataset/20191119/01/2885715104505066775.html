      <p>A day after being admitted to a private hospital in the city with complaints of respiratory trouble, actress and TMC MP Nusrat Jahan was discharged on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Sources at the hospital on EM Bypass said the Basirhat MP came with respiratory problems around 9:30pm, after which she was admitted to Intensive Care Unit.</p>
      <p>Jahan was released after her health condition showed significant improvement, a senior official of the hospital said.</p>
      <p>“She will be under medication and needs rest,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sources said that Jahan and her husband Nikhil Jain had celebrated his birthday on Sunday, after which she suddenly fell sick as she had taken an overdose of medicine.</p>
