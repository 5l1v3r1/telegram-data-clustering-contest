      <p>The new Lagos Police Commissioner Olusegun Odumosu has appealed to residents to partner security agencies  for effective crime prevention in the state.</p>
      <p>Odumosu spoke while taking over the command from his predecessor Zubairu Muazu, an Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG).</p>
      <p>He assured that the command would sustain community policing strategies, adding that his men  would respect the rights of Lagosians.</p>
      <p>Odumosu’s pledge to ensure that police respect human rights is coming at a time of public outcry against alleged human rights infractions.</p>

      <p>The police chief also vowed to ensure divisional police officers were on the field at all times, stressing he would not tolerate desk policing.</p>
      <p>“My mission is to fight crime to standstill, protect lives and properties. I am a believer of community policing. We are going to involve the citizens in the war against crime through community policing.</p>
      <p>“We will keep our officers on their toes because I am here to fight crime. I cannot be awake while my officers are sleeping. I will not take it. My officers must be awake with me.</p>
      <p>“We are going to improve on what our predecessors did especially the  outgoing AIG Zubairu Muazu,” he said.</p>
