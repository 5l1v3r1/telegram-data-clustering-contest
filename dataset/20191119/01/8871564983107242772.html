      <h1>Escape from PolyU: Protesters climb down ropes to waiting motorbikes as siege wears on</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:31:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters dramatically escaped the two-day police siege at Polytechnic University late last night by shimmying down ropes from a bridge to waiting motorbikes.</p>
      <p>Clashes rumbled into the early hours of Tuesday between protesters and police, who for hours yesterday <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/pro-dems-call-for-emergency-meeting-with-lam-as-battle-of-polyu-rages-on/">thwarted protesters’ attempts to escape</a> with volley after volley of tear gas and rubber bullets as more protesters gathered elsewhere in an attempt to divert manpower from the scene. The university siege has become a battle of wills between Hong Kong’s stretched police force and the constantly innovating protest movement.</p>

      <p>Late on Monday, dozens of black-clad protesters on a footbridge slithered down ropes several meters to a road below, where they were whisked away on motorbikes.</p>
      <p>In an apparently coordinated effort, tens of thousands of Hongkongers streamed towards the PolyU campus to break the siege, as clashes simultaneously raged with police nearby in Kowloon.</p>

      <p>The daring escape didn’t go off without a hitch, however. Reports said that at least one protester fell while attempting to climb down to the flyover below, sustaining a serious injury to his leg.</p>
      <p>As soon as police discovered the escape, they responded with tear gas, with some protesters firing arrows back in return, according to RTHK.</p>

      <p>Several dozen people remained on the campus, one protester told AFP, although a number of minors were allowed to leave after negotiations with lawmakers.</p>
      <p>RTHK reports that dozens of <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1493077-20191118.htm">injured protesters were also allowed to be taken away</a> by paramedics, but had to give their information to police before being permitted to go.</p>
      <p>A new phase of violence and drama began last week as protesters shifted their focus to weekday disruptions, resulting in schools closed, train lines disrupted and major roads blocked by barricades.</p>
      <p>Both China and the local government have refused to budge on any of the protesters’ demands.</p>
      <p>The United States said on Monday that Hong Kong authorities bear the “primary responsibility for bringing calm” to the city.</p>
      <p>Both Washington and the European Union urged restraint from all sides and called for an inquiry into the use of force during the protests.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, police had made dozens of arrests as protesters made a dash for it — sometimes beating people with batons as they held them on the ground, or kicking their heads.</p>
      <p>“Other than coming out to surrender, I don’t see any viable option for them,” Cheuk Hau-yip, the police commander in Hong Kong’s Kowloon West district, told a press conference, before the daring breakout.</p>
      <p>The campus has been designated a “riot” zone — a charge of rioting carries up to 10 years in prison — and Cheuk reiterated that police will use live rounds against protesters if faced with deadly weapons.</p>
      <p>Desperation deepened overnight inside the campus, where exhausted and scared mainly young protesters rationed their remaining food and bottled water.</p>
      <p>“I will run but never surrender. I don’t want to get arrested,” said a protester who gave his name only as ‘W’.</p>
      <p>“We are like rats in a trap.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, protests erupted in several other parts of the Kowloon peninsula, with makeshift barricades across normally bustling shopping streets.</p>
      <p>Police fired tear gas and water cannons at groups who had gathered in the Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok areas, where they also made a number of arrests.</p>
