      <h1>Gold Coasters warned to ‘start changing your habits’ as dam levels drop </h1>

      <p>Gold Coasters are being told to start becoming more water conscious now, as dam levels across the southeast continue plummeting.</p>
      <p>The total capacity across all dams is now down to 60 percent, though when it reaches 50 percent – compulsory restrictions will come into place.</p>
      <p>The Tugun desalination plant has been ramped up to try and top up supplies around the region.</p>
      <p>Though, Mayor Tom Tate has advised locals to start thinking about saving water now, warning the worst is still to come.</p>
      <p>“Looking at long term forecasts, this will probably be one of the worst, hottest seasons, and that’s when water restrictions may come in. So starting early is good.</p>
      <p>“My message to everyone is: start changing your habits, start having shorter showers, the other idea is that if you’re going to water your garden – do it later in the afternoon so that the water doesn’t evaporate. Those sort of things.</p>
      <p>“Think through that water is life and is a precious commodity,” Mayor Tate said.</p>
      <p>Due to the hot, dry conditions, fire fighters across the southeast and the whole state are still dealing with numerous blazes, which take up vital resources.</p>
      <p>Mayor Tom Tate says when it comes down to it, disaster resources come first, and that’s where the desalination plant will help.</p>
      <p>“Looking at when it comes to disaster, our water will go there first.</p>
      <p>“Looking at our dam levels – for the city of the Gold Coast at the moment – we bode well.</p>
      <p>“But nothing beats getting the water from the ocean and topping it up,” Mayor Tate said.</p>
