      <h1>WATCH: Eric Swalwell appears to break wind live on the air</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:13:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:13</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>Rep. Eric Swalwell appeared to pass gas while talking to MSNBC host Chris Matthews about impeaching President Trump.</p>
      <p>"So far the evidence is uncontradicted that the president used taxpayer dollars to ask the Ukrainians to cheat," the California Democrat said before an audible farting-type sound could be heard. The congressman soldiered on despite the brief distraction, which could have been a technical glitch.</p>
      <p>Swalwell is a former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. He dropped out earlier this year after saying he did not see a pathway to winning the nomination.</p>
      <p>Swalwell <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/its-funny-tho-swalwell-denies-breaking-wind-live-on-air">denied</a> being the source of the flatulent sound, but such did not stop Donald Trump Jr. from claiming it was the "Most intelligible thing to come out of Swalwell in years. #fartgate"</p>

      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> MSNBC's <i>Hardball</i> revealed that the noise heard by viewers was really a mug scraping across the desk in their studio.</p>
      <p>"Sorry to disappoint the conspiracy theorists - it was the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hardball?src=hashtag_click">#hardball</a> mug scraping across the desk. Get yours today and letâ€™s get back to the news!" the show tweeted Monday night.</p>
