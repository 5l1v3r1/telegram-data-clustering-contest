      <p>THE DUP has been urged to "clearly condemn" loyalist banners targeting <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/18/news/anti-john-finucane-banners-a-hate-crime-sinn-fe-in-says-1767935/">Sinn Féin's John Finucane</a> and <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/15/news/anti-claire-hanna-banner-put-up-in-south-belfast-1766013/">the SDLP's Claire Hanna</a> after the displays were reported to police.</p>
      <p>Police are "making enquiries" after several banners, which include offensive and false allegations, were erected recently against the Westminster election candidates in north and south Belfast.</p>
      <p>They are examining whether any of the banners constitute a criminal offence such as a "hate incident or hate crime".</p>
      <p>One banner targeting Mr Finucane <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/18/news/police-attend-as-banner-attacking-family-of-sinn-fein-candidate-john-finucane-is-removed-1768607/">was removed by Belfast City Council under police guard</a> yesterday morning from fencing at a council playpark in the loyalist Tigers Bay area.</p>

      <p>It made reference to Shankill bomber Sean Kelly canvassing for Sinn Féin in the North Belfast constituency and urged people to "vote unionist".</p>

      <p>PSNI Superintendent Melanie Jones said police attended to "ensure the safety of persons removing a banner from council property on behalf of Belfast City Council".</p>
      <p>She added: "Police have received reports about banners erected in north and south Belfast. Enquiries are under way to establish if these banners constitute any criminal offence or offences, including a hate incident or hate crime."</p>
      <p>A council spokeswoman said the banner in Tigers Bay was removed because it was on council property. She said the banner was still in the possession of the council.</p>

      <p>The controversy comes in two constituencies which are expected to be closely fought in the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Mr Finucane is hoping to take the North Belfast seat from DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, while the SDLP's Claire Hanna is vying to unseat the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly in South Belfast.</p>
      <p>A banner on Mayo Street off the Shankill Road in west Belfast attacks Mr Finucane and his family, including his father Pat Finucane who was murdered by loyalists in 1989.</p>
      <p>One similar to the banner removed from Tigers Bay has also been put up on the Lower Shankill Road as well as in Ballymena, Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>A Sinn Féin spokesman said the banners have been reported to police as hate crimes.</p>

      <p>Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald described the "campaign of harassment, intimidation and threats" against Mr Finucane and his family as "appalling and dangerous".</p>
      <p>"I am calling in all those in positions of leadership within political unionism, and in particular the leadership of the DUP to unequivocally condemn this in the strongest possible terms," she said.</p>
      <p>In south Belfast, a banner targeting Ms Hanna was put up at Oak Street along Donegall Pass, a traditionally loyalist area.</p>
      <p>The loyalist banner asks if Shankill bomber Sean Kelly would be campaigning for the Westminster candidate – a suggestion dismissed by the SDLP.</p>

      <p>It follows Sinn Féin standing aside in some constituencies including South Belfast in order to back other anti-Brexit candidates. The SDLP is likewise not running in North Belfast.</p>
      <p>SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: "The banners that have been erected in Belfast targeting John Finucane and Claire Hanna seeking to sow hatred and division are disgusting.</p>
      <p>"Those responsible are cynically using, abusing and retraumatising victims for narrow political purposes," he said.</p>
      <p>He added: "Parties must make a clear statement rejecting these banners and those who put them up. The DUP, in particular, must clearly condemn this. Meek rejection from party spokespeople is not enough."</p>
      <p>When asked about the banners controversy at the weekend, a DUP spokesman said in a statement: "We are unaware of the matter.</p>
      <p>"If it has been reported to the police then anyone with information should help their inquiries.</p>
      <p>"The DUP consistently condemns violence or anyone inciting hatred. Will SF now condemn those behind the many PIRA murders in North Belfast?"</p>
      <p>The DUP was asked yesterday for further comment to clarify its position, but the party only reissued its first statement.</p>
