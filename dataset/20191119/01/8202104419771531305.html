      <h3>The printed word won a rare 21st-century victory at Saskatoon city hall.</h3>
      <p>Council voted Monday to keep posting paper detour notices at Saskatoon Transit bus stops after complaints about a proposed move to go almost completely digital by the spring.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon Transit had proposed an end to the practice of posting notices at bus stops due in part to the estimated $100,000 annual cost of paying a transit manager to drive to and from bus stops to post and remove them.</p>
      <p>Riders had argued that many of those who rely on bus service lack either smartphones or data plans and that cold weather can make taking your phone out unpleasant.</p>
      <p>“I support a digital approach, but it felt like this was a digital-only approach,” Coun. Sarina Gersher said.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon Transit had originally proposed an end to posting paper notices at bus stops in October and notified riders by posting notices of the pending change at bus stops.</p>
      <p>Complaints from bus riders prompted a delay to moving detour notices to the smartphone app and the Saskatoon Transit website. Council’s transportation committee asked for more information about the move and the reasons for it.</p>
      <p>Saskatoon Transit officials told the transportation committee that, in addition to being costly, detour notices often contained outdated information because of the frequency of changes.</p>
      <p>Coun. Cynthia Block said she thought the city was doing a poor job of notifying people about notices, but would like to see the system improved for everybody.</p>
      <p>Bus Riders of Saskatoon spokesman Robert Clipperton appeared at council to repeat his observation that the transit advocacy group had received few complaints about paper notices. A city report showed that of 31 cities surveyed, only three have eliminated posted notices.</p>
      <p>Under the proposed digital move, detour notices would have still been posted at the city’s six transit terminals at Place Riel at the University of Saskatchewan, downtown on 23rd Street and at four shopping malls.</p>
      <p>Coun. Mairin Loewen said she would like to see more digital signs at bus stops.</p>
      <p>“I’m very much looking forward to that day, but I don’t think we’re there yet,” Loewen said.</p>
      <p>Council voted 9-2 to keep posting physical notices at bus stops. Coun. Troy Davies and Coun. Bev Dubois voted against the move.</p>
      <p>Dubois said she wanted to make transit better and said the number of those without smartphones is small.</p>
      <p>“I know change is difficult for some folks, including all of us,” Dubois said.</p>
