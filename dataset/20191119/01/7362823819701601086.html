      <h1>Ex-NYPD commissioner: Bloomberg 'stop-and-frisk' apology shows he forgot its success</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:41:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:41</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p>Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik claimed Monday that former New York Mayor -- and potential 2020 hopeful -- <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> has apologized for presiding over the department's "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/taking-steps-towards-possible-2020-bid-bloomberg-apologizes-to-minority-communities-for-past-policy-i-got-something-important-wrong">stop-question-and-frisk</a>" policy because he forgot how effective it was.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg -- who was elected twice as a Republican and once as an independent -- oversaw a continuation of criminal justice reforms set in place by his predecessor, current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, Kerik noted.</p>
      <p>"I think it is the apology tour," Kerik said on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">Tucker Carlson Tonight</a>" of Bloomberg's statements. "When you run for president these days, that's what you do. And that's what he's doing. I think it's disturbing."</p>
      <p>Kerik told host Tucker Carlson the "stop-question-and-frisk" policy contributed to a major reduction in New York City violent crime from the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

      <p>"I think Bloomberg and others like him that now denounce the policy, I think they forget how it started under Rudy Giuliani and the crime reductions -- [a] 65 percent reduction in violent crime between 1994 and 2002," he said.</p>
      <p>Giuliani, a Republican, defeated incumbent Democrat David Dinkins in 1993 and served two terms in City Hall -- handing the keys to Bloomberg on New Year's Day 2002. Kerik served as NYPD commissioner for the last 16 months of Giuliani's tenure as mayor.</p>
      <p>Kerik told Carlson his experience as a patrol officer in the late 1980s and early 1990s taught him the importance of "stop-question-and-frisk." He said he was assigned to Times Square as a street cop before ascending to become a plainclothes officer.</p>
      <p>"Without 'stop-question-and-frisk,' we'd never be able to do that job," he said of his anti-crime duties, which he described as "looking for guns, shots-fired, burglaries in progress -- any violent crime in progress."</p>

      <p>He called the program the "most effective tool in the New York City Police Department." Under the de Blasio administration, the number of such stops has plummeted  -- by approximately 98 percent between 2011 and 2017, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/14/stop-and-frisk-numbers-fall-dramatically-under-de-blasio/">according to the New York Post</a>.</p>
      <p>Kerik also agreed with host Tucker Carlson that Bloomberg's strong support of gun control made his "stop-and-frisk" reversal ironic.</p>
      <p>"I honestly believe this is a guy who would take every gun," he said.</p>
      <p>"He would disarm suburbia tomorrow if he could," Carlson remarked in agreement.</p>
