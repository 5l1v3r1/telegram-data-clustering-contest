      <h1>Report: UFC working on heavyweight bout between Derrick Lewis &amp; Ilir Latifi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Davies</a></address>
      <p>Fresh off of a win earlier this month at UFC 244, it looks like Derrick Lewis is set to welcome Ilir Latifi to the heavyweight division. The two men are apparently set to meet at UFC event in February next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28109216/sources-ufc-close-finalizing-derrick-lewis-ilir-latifi">ESPN</a> first reported the news, though the UFC has yet to make an official announcement. The UFC event Lewis vs. Latifi is being targeted for will take place on February 8th. No location or venue has been officially announced for the card, but reports are that the UFC 247 PPV will take place in Lewis’ hometown of Houston on that date, at the Toyota Center.</p>
      <p>Lewis (22-7, 1NC) fought four times last year, picking up three wins—including a last-gasp KO against Alexander Volkov. He eventually fought Daniel Cormier for the UFC heavyweight title, but fell short losing by second-round submission. This year ‘The Black Beast’ rebounded off a TKO loss to Junior dos Santos in March by winning a decision against Blagoy Ivanov at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>Latifi (14-7, 1NC) has only fought once in 2019, losing by second-round KO to Volkan Oezdemir in August. ‘The Sledgehammer’ only has two wins in his last five at light heavyweight, a submission over Ovince Saint-Preux and a decision against Tyson Pedro. The fight with Lewis will be Latifi’s UFC debut at 265 lbs, after announcing his move up to the division last month.</p>
      <p>A light heavyweight match-up between <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/15/20965655/ovince-saint-preux-vs-ryan-spann-targeted-ufc-event-february-mma-news">Ovince Saint-Preux &amp; Ryan Spann</a>, as well as a women’s flyweight fight between Andrea Lee &amp; Lauren Murphy and a men’s featherweight bout between Dan Ige &amp; Mirsad Bektic are the only bouts announced for the card so far. Although there are rumors that Jon Jones vs. Dominick Reyes is also targeted for the event.</p>
