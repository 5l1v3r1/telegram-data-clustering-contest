      <h3>One sad Bengals fan is living on the roof of his restaurant until further notice.</h3>
      <p>After the team fell to 0-4 earlier this fall, Jeff Lanham told his wife he would sleep on the roof of their cafe, located about 40 miles outside Cincinnati, if the Bengals lost to the Cardinals the following week.</p>

      <p>Lanham’s wife quickly passed the pledge along to local Channel 12 News, and social media onlookers urged him to stay on the roof until the Bengals’ next win.</p>
      <p>Lanham said he has spent around 23 hours per day in a 12-foot-by-10 foot rooftop tent since Oct. 7 — a day after the still-winless Bengals lost to the Cardinals. His meals are delivered by the restaurant waiters, and his wife stops by to do his laundry.</p>

      <p>“I’m so ready to come down; it’s miserable up here,” Lanham said, according to The Washington Post.</p>
      <p>“I did not plan on being up here this long. This definitely wasn’t no business move, I can tell you that. The only reason I’m even up here is to silence the haters’ mouths. I never want anyone to be able to say that I wasn’t a man of my word.”</p>

      <p>The 42-year-old father of two said he only leaves the tent — which has a flat-screen TV, heater, snacks, a cot and sleeping bag — to shower on the restaurant’s second floor.</p>
      <p>The odds of him staying on the roof the rest of the season are low, as the Bengals have only a 9 percent chance of becoming the sixth team in league history to finish the season without a win,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/17/an-nfl-fan-promised-live-his-bars-roof-until-his-team-won-hes-been-there-five-weeks/"> according to The Washington Post.</a></p>
      <p>Lanham said he would move back in with his family at the end of the season if that happened, and would return to the roof at the beginning of next season to fulfil the pledge.</p>
