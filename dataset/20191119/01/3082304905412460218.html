        <b>While seeking improvement, Lionel Scaloni is happy with Argentina’s development after their unbeaten run continued.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lionel Scaloni is satisfied with Argentina’s progress after a friendly draw against Uruguay on Monday.</p>
      <p>Argentina came from behind twice to secure a 2-2 draw in Tel Aviv, where Lionel Messi’s stoppage-time penalty cancelled out Luis Suarez’s goal after Edinson Cavani and Sergio Aguero had struck earlier.</p>
      <p>It extended Argentina’s unbeaten run to seven matches as they continued preparations for 2022 World Cup qualifying, which begins next year.</p>
      <p>Scaloni is pleased with Argentina’s development, although the coach still sees room for improvement.</p>
      <p>“At the level of results, we are fine. At the level of the game, it can be improved,” he said, via Ole.</p>
      <p>“The team feeling is the best we have. The important thing is that the players who play do it well. Some make a difference and others support.”</p>

      <p>Scaloni acknowledged the challenge awaiting his team, describing the CONMEBOL qualifiers as the toughest in the world.</p>
      <p>“Now we have to think about what we did well and what we can correct. What is coming is difficult,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I spoke with people from Uruguay. It will be difficult in the qualifiers. Those in South America are the most difficult in the world.</p>
      <p>“We have a good base.”</p>
