      <p>BAY SHORE, Long Island (WABC) -- Police are searching for a man who has been missing nearly a month after landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens but never arriving at his Long Island home.</p>
      <p>Suffolk County police say Gontran Jacques called his family on October 28 at approximately noon to discuss details of his flight home from visiting his mother in South Florida and arrange transportation to his Bay Shore home.</p>
      <p>But Jacques did not return home, and his family reported him missing on October 30.</p>
      <p>His father, Paul Jacques, tells Eyewitness News that his son does not have a cell phone after his previous one broke during the trip to Miami. He also said he does not believe his son has any credit cards, so efforts to track any spending will not be possible.</p>
      <p>"He's living in my house," he said. "He's supposed to come to my house. He never showed up. That's why I'm worried."</p>
      <p>Paul Jacques says his son called him before his flight, asking to be picked up at JFK. But when Paul told Gontran that he would be at work and couldn't pick him up, he said Gontran told him he would take a taxi or car service home.</p>
      <p>That was the last he'd heard from his son, and he said the disappearance is all the more puzzling because Gontran is a hemophiliac and needs medication.</p>
      <p>"I don't see the reason, there's no reason for him to disappear like that," he said. "I just want him to come back."</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old Jacques is Haitian, 6-foot-3 and approximately 300 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.</p>
      <p>Detectives are asking anyone who may have information on Jacques' location to call the Third Squad at 631-854-8352 or 911.</p>
