      <p>Ladoke Akintola University of Technology lecturers began strike on Monday  after the ultimatum they had given to the school jointly owned by Oyo and Osun states to  pay  them their three month’ salaries expired.</p>
      <p>The  Vice-Chancellor of the school in Ogbomoso, Oyo State, Prof. M. Ologunde,  didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone by our correspondent  seeking his comment.</p>
      <p>Also, he  had yet to  reply to a  text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.</p>
      <p>The Academic Staff Union of Universities branch  of the institution’s   10-day ultimatum to  LAUTECH to pay them expired on  November 15.</p>
      <p>The decision to down tools was reached at the congress of the union held on the campus on Monday, according to  LAUTECH ASUU Chairman, Dr Biodun Olaniran,  and Secretary, Dr Toyin Abegunrin.</p>
      <p>The union also threatened to withhold the ‘rain semester’ results of 2018/2019 academic session until they were paid.</p>
      <p>Olaniran said  the decision was reached after reviewing the situation regarding non-payment of their  salaries.</p>
