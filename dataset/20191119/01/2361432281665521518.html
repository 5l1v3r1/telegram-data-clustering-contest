      <h1>GOP Rep Kevin McCarthy Calls on ABC News to Explain Amy Robach's Spiked Jeffrey Epstein Story</h1>
      <h2>“What appears to have been presented to Ms. Robach is first-hand evidence of human trafficking,” House Minority leader writes in letter obtained by Megyn Kelly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:08:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/jennifer-maas/" target="_blank">Jennifer Maas</a></address>
      <p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has called on ABC News president James Goldston to explain why the network declined to broadcast a 2015 story that Amy Robach had reported about the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the California congressman called out ABC News in a letter to Goldston, which was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4_HsjCg_L5/">first obtained and shared by Megyn Kelly,</a> for its decision to scrap the story, which was revealed this month in hot-mic footage of Robach leaked by Project Veritas. In the video, Robach said the story was “quashed” after she spoke with an Epstein accuser who told her “everything.”</p>
      <p>“What appears to have been presented to Ms. Robach is first-hand evidence of human trafficking,” McCarthy wrote in the letter, which was also signed by Reps. Mike McCaul (R-Texas) and Doug Collins (R-Ga.). “I am deeply concerned that this victim, in search of justice, went to ABC News, provided information and an interview, and then ABC News chose to bury the truth. This was a decision that Ms. Robach alluded was due to protecting powerful people or financial interests.”</p>

      <p>The letter continues: “Although it is unclear whether anyone thought to alert authorities to further examine these deeply disturbing allegations, it is clear that ABC News’ enabling of Mr. Epstein has consequences: fewer victims willing to come forward to bring perpetrators of this modern-day slavery to justice and, more grievously, the possibility that any number of minors could have been spared from human trafficking over the past three years.”</p>
      <p>Representatives for ABC News and McCarthy’s office did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on the letter.</p>
      <p>Epstein died of apparent suicide in August while in custody awaiting trial for charges related to sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking.</p>
      <p>McCarthy did not indicate what authority Congress — or members of Congress in the minority — had to investigate the internal operations of a news organization, which ordinarily claims broad protections both under the First Amendment as well as protection of trade secrets.</p>
      <p>According to the letter, McCarthy seeks answers from ABC News on the following questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Will ABC News provide Congress the interview Ms. Robach conducted with the victim?</li>
        <li>What did ABC News learn about Jeffrey Epstein after Ms. Robach first presented her story to executives?</li>
        <li>Who was involved in deciding this story was not of public interest, and what were their reasons for deciding so?</li>
        <li>Can Ms. Robach expand on the “outside forces” she mentioned as potentially responsible for the story not running?</li>
        <li>Was ABC News ever presented with additional evidence on Mr. Epstein from the time Ms. Robach first brought her investigation to the network and when he was ultimately arrested?</li>
        <li>Were authorities alerted at any time after Ms. Robach presented ABC News executives with her reporting? If so, when and what was provided?</li>
      </ol>
