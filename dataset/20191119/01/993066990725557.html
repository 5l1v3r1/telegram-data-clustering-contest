        <b>BACK IN THE DAY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Irish News, Thursday November 19 2009: World Cup 2010 Qualifying play-off, second leg:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>France 1 Republic of Ireland 1 (after extra time: agg-2-1)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Brilliant Irish are robbed of World Cup finals place by controversial extra-time goal</b>
      </p>
      <p>Republic of Ireland manager Giovanni Trapattoni said he was ‘‘angry’’ after a blatant Thierry Henry handball put paid to the Republic of Ireland’s hopes of qualifying for next year’s World Cup finals last night.</p>
      <p>Henry’s assist for William Gallas’ extra-time equaliser meant that Raymond Domenech’s misfiring superstars will be in South Africa next summer despite being outplayed by a gallant Ireland who took the lead 12 minutes from half-time when Damien Duff reached the byline on the left and pulled the ball back for Robbie Keane to sidefoot home superbly.</p>
      <p>‘‘I am still angry because it is a bitter evening for me,’’ said Trapattoni.</p>
      <p>‘‘We played a very great game, I’m sure all of the European people saw that we deserved to win. I saw the handball – it was clear, too much clear.’’ He added: ‘‘I told the players ‘I am proud of you and you deserve to go to Africa’.</p>
