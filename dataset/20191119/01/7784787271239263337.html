      <h1>Esava Ratugolea’s selfless offer to help Josh Jenkins fit in seamlessly at Geelong</h1>

      <h3>Versatile tall Esava Ratugolea is open to a change of role in the 2020 AFL season as Geelong figures out how to make best use of new arrival Josh Jenkins.</h3>
      <p>The 197cm Ratugolea played mostly as a marking forward foil for 198cm spearhead Tom Hawkins in 2019, while also providing ruck cover for Rhys Stanley.</p>
      <p>At 199cm, Jenkins shapes as a third tall attacking option, having booted 296 goals in 147 games with Adelaide.</p>

      <p>“I’m not sure what the coaches want (but) I’m happy to play anywhere,” the 21-year-old Ratugolea told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“If Josh needs more space I’ll give him more space.</p>
      <p>“That will probably give me more chance to play a bit more in the ruck as well and help Rhys out a little bit.</p>
      <p>“I like to play as a forward but I like to play in the ruck as well because it gets me into the game a lot more.”</p>

      <p>The only knock on the hugely-promising Ratugolea in his first three seasons in the AFL system was that his lack of endurance limited the amount of time he was able to spend in the ruck.</p>
      <p>He was happy to address the need to cover the ground better with the coaching staff during his 2019 post-season review, along with improving his strength and bodywork.</p>
      <p>“It would just be more doing it on a consistent level, crashing more packs and getting to more contests,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But then being able to get back to the goalsquare and being another target up- forward; building on what I did in the second half of this season.”</p>

      <p>Geelong topped the table at the end of the home and away season in 2019 but bowed out in the preliminary final to eventual premiers Richmond.</p>
      <p>The Cats’ first-to-fourth-year players resumed training this week along with off-season recruits Jenkins and four-time St Kilda best and fairest winner Jack Steven.</p>
      <p>Star midfielders Patrick Dangerfield and Mitch Duncan were also on the track on Tuesday, ahead of schedule.</p>
