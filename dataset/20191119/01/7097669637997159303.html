      <p>This one sounds like the setup for a solid joke.</p>
      <p>A cow, donkey and camel were found wandering together on a Kansas road. They didn't end up in a local bar, but they did cause enough of a stir for the police and the local sheriff's office to get involved. </p>
      <p>The trio was found just outside the city limits of Goddard, a suburb of Wichita, according to Goddard Police Department community services officer Aja Fulcher. An officer took a photo of the animals before they were returned to a private owner.</p>
      <p>The photo was posted to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/posts/2659811690724880">Goddard Police Department's Facebook page</a>, where it has been shared more than 800 times as of Monday evening.</p>

      <p>"Does anyone know the owners of these three friends traveling together (towards a Northern star) just East of Goddard?" the police department posted along with the photo of the animals. "If we can not locate the owner, we may be halfway towards a live nativity this Christmas season." </p>
      <p>The Sedwick County Sheriff's Office confirmed a 911 call about the animals on a "well-traveled" highway on Sunday. </p>
      <p>The animals weren't part of any of holiday play, Fulcher said. That part of the post was just a joke. Fulcher said the police department originally thought the camel, cow and donkey belonged to the <a href="https://www.twpark.com/about">Tanganyika Wildlife Park</a>, a Kansas zoo.</p>
