      <h1>2 Stocks That Got Punched on Monday</h1>
      <h2>One company considered to be a marijuana stock was burned, as was a familiar consumer goods name embroiled in controversy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:46:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com/author/4067/" target="_blank">Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman)</a></address>
      <p>It was a fairly good Monday for many stocks, with indexes generally headed in the right direction (i.e., up). Even some of the more sluggish movers of late managed to rise in price.</p>
      <p>I'm here to discuss two that didn't. Both declined, at least partially due to fresh news coming from their press rooms. Without further ado, let's step into the ring for a closer look at the action.</p>

      <h3>Scotts Miracle-Gro</h3>
      <p>Although <b>Scotts Miracle-Gro</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/scotts-miracle-gro/smg/">NYSE:SMG</a>) isn't exclusively in the business of cannabis, many investors nevertheless consider it as belonging to the small universe of <a href="https://www.fool.com/marijuana-stocks/">marijuana stocks</a>.</p>
      <p>That's not a great club to belong to these days, as <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/18/weekly-cannabis-stock-news.aspx">marijuana stocks have really taken a hit this year</a> on both poor company-specific fundamentals and industrywide challenges. Perhaps this disfavor with the asset class is why the stock took a 4% hit to its price on Monday.</p>
      <p>No doubt compounding this is Scotts Miracle-Gro's recently reported Q4 of fiscal 2019 results. Revenue for the period exceeded analyst estimates, coming in 15% higher on a year-over-year basis at nearly $498 million, versus the average estimate, which was nearly 11% lower.</p>
      <p>But net loss was deeper than anticipated. This landed at $50.7 million, or $0.91 per share, against the expected earnings per share of $0.87.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, it's the marijuana wing of Scotts Miracle-Gro that's showing the most miraculous growth. For the entirety of fiscal 2019, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/27/these-stocks-are-the-biggest-winners-and-losers-wi.aspx">the Hawthorne Gardening unit</a>, which sells products used mainly or exclusively in the cultivation of cannabis, nearly doubled its sales.</p>
      <p>That was vastly better than the core U.S. consumer business (up only 8%) and the small catchall "other" category (down 2%). So perhaps, having digested these results, investors are growing (<i>ha ha</i>) concerned that the company has only one good source of growth.</p>
      <p>To an extent, I think that's valid. Hawthorne will likely continue to improve its sales figures, although it's conceivable that as a maturing business it won't come close to posting another double in future fiscal years. After all, the marijuana industry is developing more slowly than anticipated, with legalization proceeding at a snail's pace overall.</p>
      <p>All that said, Scotts Miracle-Gro shares aren't very expensive on a valuation basis, and despite those fits and starts, the cannabis industry is here to stay and will improve as the legal environment continues to thaw. I think investors should consider buying this stock despite the headwinds.</p>
      <h3>Under Armour</h3>
      <p>There's nothing like a worsening scandal to leech a stock price. So it is with once-high-flying athletic wear purveyor <b>Under Armour</b> (<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/under-armour-c-shares/ua/">NYSE:UA</a>), which saw its shares dip by nearly 2% on Monday, thanks to continued fallout from a controversy.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, in the wake of the company's latest quarterly results release, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/11/fraud-why-under-armour-stock-likely-headed-lower.aspx">Under Armour was under federal investigation</a> for its accounting practices.</p>
      <p>And late last week, a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article said that unnamed "former executives" at the company used possibly fraudulent means to extend a long string of quarterly sales growth results of 20% and more. Understandably, Under Armour is now being targeted by irate investors and other concerned parties <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/12/under-armour-under-investigation-what-does-it-mean.aspx">in a class action lawsuit</a>.</p>
      <p>No matter how well a company is doing, these sorts of underhanded actions (if proven to be accurately reported) are indicative of desperate management that has misplaced its priorities. Such a business probably can't be trusted to report accurate numbers, and we should never buy anything on data that is less than precise and true.</p>
      <p>Under Armour might, just might, get a pass if its business was going gangbusters. That's really no longer the case, though. Other companies, such as longtime powerhouse rival <b>Nike</b>, have successfully pushed into segments such as athleisurewear. No wonder Under Armour recently made a big cut to its full-year revenue guidance.</p>
      <p>The combination of lower-than-expected growth and legal controversy is enough for me to stay away from this stock. Plus, even with this latest pullback, it's still quite pricey on anticipated profitability.</p>
