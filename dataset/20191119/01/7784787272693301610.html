      <h3>Fremantle has locked away arguably its biggest name that was out of contract at the end of next year, with Luke Ryan recommitting to the club.</h3>
      <p>The Dockers confirmed on Tuesday that Ryan had signed a three-year contract extension on top of the season he already had left to run, therefore tying him to the club until at least the end of 2023.</p>
      <p>Ryan, 23, has become one of the key cogs in Fremantle’s backline since it drafted him with Pick 66 in 2016 as a mature-age prospect.</p>

      <p>Rated elite for intercept possessions and intercept marks according to Champion Data, Ryan said he was keen to repay the faith Fremantle had shown in him.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got my family back home but when I spoke to them, we came to the conclusion that Fremantle gave me my chance – if it wasn’t for Fremantle I probably wouldn’t have been playing AFL.</p>

      <p>“(Before) I was called out with pick 66, I felt it was my last chance and, luckily enough, they called me. I owe it to Fremantle and what they’ve done for me, so I wanted to sign on.”</p>
      <p>Ryan, who was ranked second in the AFL for average intercepts in 2019, has played 49 games in three seasons.</p>
      <p>Fremantle list manager Mark Micallef said Ryan had established himself the club’s defensive set-up and had high hopes for him.</p>
      <p>“With Luke’s intercept ability and ability to use the ball by foot, he adds to the defensive pillars we have in our defence,” Micallef said.</p>
      <p>“We see Luke as being a really strong and hopefully elite player of the competition. He has the football characteristics that are vital for our success and we hope he can lock in that role as a strong leader of our defence.”</p>
