      <h1>UK weather: Warnings as freezing fog and more flooding set to smash into -9C Britain</h1>
      <h2>More extreme weather on the way</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Dangerous freezing fog will blanket Britain today as more flooding is expected to hit large parts of the UK.</p>
      <p>A y<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/met-office-warning-freezing-fog-3551966">ellow weather warning for freezing fog</a> has been issued between 4am to 11am today (Tuesday).</p>
      <p>And 42 flood warnings remain in place, many of which relate to rivers in the Midlands and Yorkshire, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-uk-weather-forecast-met-20908180">the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Following heavy rainfall last week, some parts of Yorkshire are still submerged underwater.</p>
      <p>Motorists are being urged to expect "slower journey times with delays to bus and train services possible," due to the fog.</p>
      <p>The worst-affected areas include most of the Midlands, Home Counties and southeast of England. Temperatures in these regions will struggle to exceed 5C.</p>
      <p>The Met Office warns: "Travelling in fog can be extremely dangerous. Fog can drift rapidly and is often patchy."</p>
      <h3>Advice for road users when travelling in fog</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid travel if possible</li>
        <li>Drive very slowly with dipped headlights, full-beam lights reflect off the fog causing a 'white wall' effect</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on your speed, fog can give the illusion of moving in slow motion</li>
        <li>Use fog lights, but remember to turn them off when the visibility improves</li>
        <li>Don't hang on the tail lights of the car in front, rear lights can give a false sense of security</li>
        <li>Watch out for freezing fog which is made of water droplets that freeze on contact with objects such as the pavement, road, car, etc. It can quickly form a layer of ice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Wednesday will see variable cloud cover with bright spells and a few spots of rain or drizzle, though the south-west and Northern Ireland will see rain more persistent in nature.</p>
      <p>Temperatures will plunge below 0C again on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Thursday promises to be a damp day for Northern Ireland, Wales and south-west England, although it should be largely dry elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Bristol will escape the worst of the weather, with lows of just 1C. By Friday, temperatures are expected to climb up to double figures again in our city when the mercury peaks at 10C.</p>
      <h3>Met Office weather forecast:</h3>
      <h4>Tuesday:</h4>
      <p>Fog gradually lifting during the morning with bright or sunny spells developing. Rain arriving over Northern Ireland may affect the far west of mainland UK later. Still cold for most.</p>
      <h4>Outlook for Wednesday to Friday:</h4>
      <p>Turning increasingly unsettled from the southwest with showers or longer spells of rain, heaviest in southwest England and south Wales. Windy at times but temperatures recovering to nearer normal.</p>
