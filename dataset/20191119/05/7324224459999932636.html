      <p>Taylor Swift appears to have been cleared to perform a medley of her old songs at an upcoming music awards show after her former record label said it would not stand in her way.</p>
      <p>The pop superstar has been involved in an increasingly bitter row with Big Machine Records and its new owners, represented by prominent talent manager Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>Swift last week released an impassioned plea to her fans on social media, asking them to pressure Braun and Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta.</p>

      <p>She alleged they were blocking her from performing music from her first five albums at the American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old is set to be named artist of the decade during Sunday’s ceremony.</p>
      <p>Now, Big Machine, which denied Swift’s allegations, has released a statement saying it has come to an agreement with Dick Clark Productions, which produces the AMAs, seemingly allowing Swift to perform freely.</p>
      <p>However, Dick Clark Productions denied such an agreement had been reached, adding: “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”</p>

      <p>A representative for Swift has been contacted for comment.</p>
      <p>The row between Swift and Braun, who represents high-profile artists including Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, became public in June.</p>
      <p>After Braun’s Ithaca Holdings bought Big Machine for 300 million US dollars, about £231 million, thereby acquiring the rights to Swift’s back catalogue, she said she was “sad” and “grossed out”.</p>
      <p>She accused him of “incessant, manipulative bullying”. Swift said a planned Netflix documentary about her career is in jeopardy because she cannot use her old music in the film.</p>
      <p>She signed with Big Machine as a teenager before leaving for Universal Music Group last year.</p>
