      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:47:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/ap/" target="_blank">AP</a></address>
      <p>Pakistanâ€™s ailing former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted of corruption, has left the country and is traveling to London for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>Sharif departed on a special plane on Tuesday from the city of Lahore, after a court granted him permission to leave for four weeks abroad for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>His conviction was earlier suspended for eight weeks on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old Sharif was sentenced to seven years in prison on corruption charges in 2019. After his health deteriorated last month, he was <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/pakistan/nawaz-sharifs-health-deteriorates-doctors-stop-heart-medication-report-6092419/"><b>rushed from his cell to a hospital</b></a> in Lahore. While in hospital, he <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/world/ex-pakistan-premier-nawaz-sharif-suffers-angina-attack-6089241/"><b>suffered a minor heart attack</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Three times prime minister, Sharif was removed from office by the judiciary in 2017 over corruption allegations. He denies the charge, saying he was politically victimized.</p>
