      <h2>Gareth Farrelly looks back on his difficult time at Everton and his goal that enabled them to escape relegation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/chris-beesley/" target="_blank">Chris Beesley</a></address>
      <p>Over the past week, Evertonians have been lapping up the nostalgia surrounding the <i>Howard's Way</i> film that tells the story of the club's most-successful side but if the 1984/85 season was the high-point for the Blues then 1997/98 was the nadir.</p>
      <p>But heroes don't just come to the fore during the good times though and despite having to endure one of the most testing campaigns in Goodison Park history, Gareth Farrelly proved to be <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton's</a> saviour in their darkest hour.</p>
      <p>He told the ECHO: “When you talk about Everton memories and the film <i>Howard's Way</i> – they were my heroes as well.</p>
      <p>“When I was growing up, they were the people that I revered, the ones who I was trying to replicate in the garden.”</p>
      <p>Dublin-born Farrelly was a life-long Blue but his dream move in 1997 threatened to turn into a nightmare.</p>
      <p>Now over two decades on he is brutally honest about the naivety he now realises he had for the situation he was letting himself in for after just a clutch of first team appearances at previous club Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was an Evertonian from 1983. I signed for Everton because it was the only club I ever wanted to play for. <br/>“I didn't sit down rationally and objectively and think that Everton have been in relegation trouble for the last few years and the club is not in a great place at the moment, I just wanted to play for Everton.<br/>“I was ill-prepared for coming to Liverpool generally. Although I was an Everton fan, at that time I never really understood the intensity, the city or what it meant to people. I was a young boy.</p>
      <p>“I can look back now retrospectively and whether I'd do things differently – absolutely – but I don't carry that.</p>
      <p>“Despite how difficult it was, I had one of the best outcomes. It writes itself.”</p>

      <p>Farrelly added: “It was my first full season as a first team player. Because of what had happened before I wouldn't say that it was a positive environment to be in.</p>
      <p>“I wasn't a senior player coming off the back of the 'Dogs of War' era so I was learning on my feet.</p>
      <p>“It takes a different type of character to come through that, to still want to receive a pass, take a shot and do things when things aren't going well for you.</p>
      <p>“It was a very challenging year, no doubt. You don't sign for your boyhood club thinking that you're going to be in a relegation battle for a year, you go in with romantic ideals.”</p>
      <p>Despite Everton chairman Peter Johnson vowing “never again” after the club's 'Great Escape' against Wimbledon in 1994, just four years later the Blues went into the final game of the season staring into the abyss.</p>
      <p>Whereas first time around, Mike Walker's men were one of five teams looking to avoid two remaining relegation spots, the scenario facing the club's most-successful manager <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/howard-kendall">Howard Kendall</a>, back for a third spell in charge, was far more clear-cut.</p>

      <p>Everton simply had to get a better result at home to Coventry City than Bolton Wanderers did at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Despite the nerves jangling, Farrelly recalls that he could tell it was going to be a different kind of day from early on.</p>
      <p>He said: “Through the course of a season fans will be unhappy because the team is not doing well.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is irate and there's negativity but that goes with the responsibility of playing for a club as big as Everton.</p>
      <p>“On that day though, all of that stuff that had gone on before didn't really matter.</p>
      <p>“There's only one outcome that we all wanted. That's why the atmosphere was incredibly special.</p>
      <p>“We'd stayed on the Wirral in Parkgate and once we'd gone through the tunnel during the bus journey in there were people on the street from early on with flags.</p>
      <p>“Once we arrived at the ground there was a different atmosphere than normal, an intensity.</p>
      <p>“When we went out to warm-up the ground was nearly full already.</p>
      <p>“Everton's women had won their cup and were out on the pitch and the youngsters had won the FA Youth Cup and they were there too.</p>
      <p>“With about 20 minutes to go until kick-off you thought: 'This is kind of special.'”</p>
      <p>Farrelly – whose only over goal for the club had been at Scunthorpe United in the League Cup second round back in September – grabbed what proved to be the solitary Premier League strike of his time at the Blues just seven minutes into the contest.</p>
      <p>Playing a somewhat unorthodox one-two with Duncan Ferguson, the midfielder launched a punt towards the centre-forward's head which was nodded back to him just outside the D of the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Taking the ball down on his chest, Farrelly then arrowed his shot past Magnus Hedman and into the top-left corner of the Swedish international keeper's Park End goal.</p>
      <p>He said: “I enjoyed playing in big games so I didn't feel the pressure and think that I didn't want the ball.</p>
      <p>“So having tried and failed throughout the season to find the net, to score that goal at that time with everything that followed, it was fabulous.</p>
      <p>“I still meet people now who have a story associated with that day. It is such a big thing.</p>
      <p>“It wasn't just me, there were a whole team of us playing in the game but fundamentally that goal is significant in the history of the club and I'm incredibly proud of that.</p>
      <p>“About four years ago I went to Goodison with my son and it was amazing to look at it through his eyes.</p>
      <p>“In the build-up before the game they were showing old footage and the goal from 1998 came on so I've probably only re-engaged with it and given it any thought over the last few years.”</p>

      <p>So just what prompted Farrelly, who had struggled to get his eye in all season, to try his luck at that point?</p>
      <p>He said: “You can talk about bravery. Over the course of the season you keep shooting. You either make a goalie look great or hit someone in row z but you have to keep going even if things are hard, you're getting stick and under pressure.</p>
      <p>“I always thought if I keep doing it, it will come right. I don't sit and reminisce or the ball dropping or my contact with the ball, when I look at it now I see that it was a good goal, a really good goal – half volley, bad foot, top corner, keeper fully stretched.</p>
      <p>“There was an immediate realise in the ground after the goal and everything was huge.”</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Everton could have doubled their advantage six minutes from the end but Nick Barmby's penalty was saved and when with just a minute left on the clock Coventry levelled the scores when Dion Dublin's tame header squirmed through home keeper Thomas Myhre's hands.</p>
      <p>Despite the setbacks, Bolton were already losing 1-0 at Stamford Bridge and then conceded a second goal in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Farrelly believes the equaliser was a cruel moment for the Norwegian and although his move to Everton didn't come under the circumstances he would have liked, he still enjoyed working under the Blues most-successful manager.</p>
      <p>He said: “Thomas Myhre had been magnificent that season but probably didn't get the credit because he was in a team that was struggling.</p>

      <p>“He was exceptional when he came in though, replacing Neville (<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/neville-southall">Southall</a>) – an impossible task – but he let the ball go through his hands.</p>
      <p>“It was an incredible memory and experience but not one I'd like every year.</p>
      <p>“Howard (Kendall) was still charismatic, dynamic, a brilliant man-manager. I got on terrifically well with him but our relationship got stronger afterwards because I think the game had changed.</p>
      <p>“It was a new environment but I don't look back at that season in any great detail now because there was an incredibly positive outcome.”</p>
      <p>Farrelly would depart Goodison Park the following year – ironically to Bolton – but he made some lifelong friendships from his relatively short time at the club.</p>
      <p>He said: “I keep in contact with Slaven (Bilic) who was my room mate. It's great to see how well he's done throughout his managerial career and how well he's doing right now (his West Bromwich Albion side are currently top of the Championship).</p>

      <p>“When I go back to Everton I see Duncan (<a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/duncan-ferguson">Ferguson</a>) and while I think the word gets bandied about too much now, I'd consider him to be a legend at the club, I don't think you've got a lot of people like him.</p>
      <p>“I think we've got to be very careful with our former players. That's difficult in football now there's a lot that's manufactured or paint by numbers so it's important with the way the game is changing.”</p>
