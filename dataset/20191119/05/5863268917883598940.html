      <h1>Nawaz Sharif to leave for London today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:12:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:12</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – The preparations for former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s departure for London to receive medical treatment have been finalized and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo is likely to fly to London today (Tuesday).</p>
      <p>According to sources, an air ambulance from Qatar will reach at the Allama Iqbal International Airport at 8:00am to transport Nawaz Sharif to London. Nawaz Sharif will be accompanied by Shehbaz Sharif and his personal physician Doctor Adnan.</p>
      <p>Sources further informed that Nawaz Sharif will leave Jati Umra for Lahore airport at 9:00am. The PML-N supremo, accompanied by his daughter Maryam Nawaz, son-in-law Capt (retd) Safdar and other family members, will be taken to Airport in a caravan.</p>
      <p>A large number of PML-N leaders and workers will be part of the caravan. An ambulance of Sharif Medical City will also travel with the caravan of Nawaz Sharif from Jati Umra to airport.</p>
      <p>Former premier’s medication has been changed to enable him to travel. Nawaz Sharif will be shifted to the Harley Street Clinic in London immediately after landing.</p>
      <p>With the flying fuel of 10 hours and two pilots, the air ambulance will be equipped with oxygen cylinders, ventilators, ICU and other medical facilities, while two doctors, including Sharif’s personal physician Dr Adnan, and paramedics will also assist the PML-N supremo during his travel.</p>
      <p>PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said in her statement that Nawaz Sharif will depart abroad on Tuesday with prayers of 22 crore people.</p>
      <p>“We shall warmly welcome Nawaz Sharif when he returns to Pakistan after recuperating. The government should turn its focus to serve people instead of getting jealous of Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Interior Ministry has removed the name of former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif from the Exit Control List (ECL) so that he can fly abroad for his treatment.</p>
      <p>It is pertinent here to mention that the Lahore High Court had on Saturday ordered to remove Sharif’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL) without any conditionality and allowed him to travel abroad to get health treatment for four weeks. The court had rejected an objection made by the federal government over PML-N’s proposed draft.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Prime Minister Imran Khan directed the government’s legal team to analyze the decision of the Lahore High Court and submit a report to the federal cabinet.</p>
      <p>The premier also asked the legal team to brief the cabinet over the verdict. The government would then decide whether to appeal against the LHC’s decision or not.</p>
