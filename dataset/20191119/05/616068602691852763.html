      <p>A woman, identified in media reports as Heather Friesen confronted Mayor Colin Basran following Monday's council meeting at UBC Okanagan.</p>
      <p>She has stated in media reports Kelowna RCMP considered allegations she was raped by a number of men more than 30 years ago as unfounded.</p>
      <p>The allegation is part of a Stats Can report that states 40 per cent of rapes reported to the Kelowna RCMP in 2018 and 2019 were deemed unfounded. The provincial average is 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>"The survivors in this community who are too afraid to report (rape) because of the reputation of the RCMP in this community are not just anyone," she shouted at the mayor.</p>
      <p>"I had the courage to stand in front of your office and call you out by name. And, when you apologize, all you say is anyone."</p>
      <p>The allegation by Friesen stems from Basran's initial statement on the report.</p>
      <p>"I'm satisfied that our RCMP officers investigating these files are doing the best they can with the resources they have," said Basran at the time.</p>
      <p>He has since issued a second statement, saying in part he should have waited until an RCMP investigation was complete before responding.</p>
      <p>“I am sorry and offer my sincere apology to anyone offended or hurt by my initial reaction to this news," Basran stated in a second statement issued Friday.</p>
      <p>"The number of local sex assault complaints deemed to be unfounded is deeply concerning, and I know the local detachment is taking this matter seriously."</p>
      <p>Friesen said the mayor should have the courage to meet her.</p>
      <p>"You know where I live, you know who I am.</p>
      <p>"Have the courage to come to me. I shouldn't have to beg you."</p>
      <p>Basran stated Monday he didn't know where she lived.</p>
