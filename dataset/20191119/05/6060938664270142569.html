      <h1>Refuse to be part of unfair, unjust decision: Aisam Qureshi</h1>

      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pakistan">Pakistan</a>'s top doubles player Aisam ul Haq Qureshi said on Monday he was pulling out of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup">Davis Cup</a> tie against India if it was not played in Islamabad.</p>
      <p>"I have informed the Pakistan federation of my decision. If the tie is not played in my home and at a neutral venue, I refuse to be a part of it. Someone has to take a stand here, and this is me standing up for the honour and dignity of my country," he told TOI from Karachi.</p>
      <p>Quereshi was scathing of what he called an "unjust, unfair and biased decision" against his country. "The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Tennis-Federation">International Tennis Federation</a> (ITF) has been put under a lot or pressure by the Indian federation to have the venue shifted, but I cannot be a part of it," he said. "We were ready to extend our hands in friendship. I was looking forward to welcome my Indian friends. We were ready to extend them a threat-free visit but it appears the Indian side is bent upon playing politics over sport."</p>
      <p>He added: "Everyday thousands of Indians come to Pakistan, to Kartarpur. They perform their religious activities freely without any threat perception at all, so why can't both nations play sports in our country?" he said.</p>
      <p>Quereshi has informed the Pakistan federation of his decision and had even posted it on social media.</p>
