      <h1>'Is that this week?': White House awaits Anonymous book with a yawn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Crilly</a></address>
      <p>The White House is shrugging off publication of a book by an anonymous author claiming to be a senior administration official, reacting with a mix of weary indifference and lukewarm contempt.</p>
      <p>The book, <i>A Warning</i>, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/author-of-anonymous-new-york-times-op-ed-to-publish-tell-all-book">goes on sale Tuesday</a> after two weeks of lackluster reviews.</p>
      <p>Although other books have prompted the White House to prepare for battle, this one arrives with officials focused on impeachment hearings and keen to present an air of normality.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Grisham, the president’s press secretary, said: “Others can fret about ridiculous, cowardly accusations; President Trump remains focused on delivering results to the American people.”</p>
      <p>She added that the White House now had a clearer idea of the identity of the author.</p>
      <p>“Yes — a coward,” she said when asked.</p>
      <p>The anonymous author first surfaced with an op-ed piece published last year by the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html">New York Times</a></i>. The writer suggested a cabal of officials had launched a resistance effort inside the White House to thwart “Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.”</p>
      <p>But with publication of the book looming, officials said the approach of remaining anonymous undermined any effort at authority. And the absence of explosive new details — aside from well-known accounts of the president’s bad temper and short attention span — makes it easier to dismiss.</p>
      <p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/author-team-of-vipers-about-trump-white-house-joins-alabama-marketing-firm">Cliff Sims’s</a> insider tale of working for Trump, <i>Team of Vipers</i>, created an air of excitement and dread inside the White House at the start of the year, according to a former staffer.</p>
      <p>“Everyone was dying to have a look at it and see if their names were in it. This one doesn’t feel the same,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ask aides this week about the anonymous book, and the response is largely indifference.</p>
      <p>“Is that this week?” one said.</p>
      <p>Such responses might be dismissed as an act of affected nonchalance were it not for a string of scathing reviews in publications that might usually be expected to talk up any warts-and-all biographies of the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>A withering <i>New York Times</i> review highlighted how the unnamed author has flipped and flopped on how best to resist Trump’s wilder impulses and ridicules an insider whose insight appears little greater than an outsider’s.</p>
      <p>“<i>A Warning</i>, Anonymous says, is intended for a ‘broad audience,’ though to judge by the parade of bland, methodical arguments (Anonymous loves to qualify criticisms with a lawyerly ‘in fairness’), the ideal reader would seem to be an undecided voter who has lived in a cave for the past three years, and is irresistibly moved by quotations from Teddy Roosevelt and solemn invocations of Cicero,” the <i>Times</i> wrote.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/13/profiles-thinking-about-courage-inside-warning-by-anonymous/">The Washington Post</a></i> concludes the book adds little to the debate other than to repeat descriptions of a president uninterested in detail and who regards criticism as treason.</p>
      <p>“However accurate and sobering such characterizations may be, they all belong in a folder labeled Stuff We Already Know. Unfortunately, much of <i>A Warning</i> reads like a longer version of the op-ed, purposely vague and avoiding big revelations in order to preserve the author’s anonymity.”</p>
