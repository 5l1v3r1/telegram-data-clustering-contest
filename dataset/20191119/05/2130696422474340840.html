      <h1>Higher Q3 GDP growth seen with electronics 'recovery underway'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:50:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author">Chuang Peck Ming</a></address>
      <p>Singapore</p>
      <p>SINGAPORE'S exports dropped by an unexpected double digit in October, but a bottoming electronics sector has prompted private-sector economists to adjust upward their growth forecasts for gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Maybank Kim Eng economists are looking at a final GDP growth figure for July-September of 0.8 per cent year-on-year - higher than the government's initial estimate of 0.1 per cent - even as Enterprise Singapore (ESG) reported on Monday that "high base" effect in non-electronics exports knocked the NODX down 12.3 per cent year-on-year last month, steeper than the 10.0 per cent polled by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Indicating the better showing of electronics shipments in October, rising to a 9-month high, Maybank KE's Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said in a brief report: "We think the electronics downcycle is past its worst and a recovery, albeit sluggish, is underway. This will be led by improving smartphone" numbers, which saw global sales recover in the third quarter."</p>
      <p>According to ESG's latest official trade figures, electronics NODX dropped 16.4 per cent in October - the "softest pace" since February, Maybank KE's report notes - easing from a 24.8 per cent decline in September. Month on month, October electronics exports were up, the trade promotion agency said.</p>

      <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry is due to release the final third-quarter GDP growth figure on Thursday.</p>
      <p>OCBC Bank's Selena Ling expects the figure to be revised up to 0.5 per cent - though she attributes the revision to a better-than-expected September industrial production.</p>
      <p>UOB Bank's Barnabas Gan noted that the moderation in the decline of the electronics NODX "is in line with the surprise rebound in the industrial production" in September.</p>
      <p>The Maybank KE report adds: "Manufacturing and exports will recover at a gradual pace, as the tariff shock dissipates. A partial US-China trade deal would help reduce uncertainty and spark some modest recovery in capital expenditures and trade in 2020".</p>
      <p>Maybank KE projects the economy to grow 0.9 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent in 2020.</p>
      <p>Barclays' Brian Tan, who was close to the mark in predicting October's NODX to fall 13 per cent, said: "NODX levels still appear to be bottoming out despite the sequential decline in October, which should help to put the brakes on the future year-on-year declines."</p>
      <p>Barclays sees Singapore's GDP rising 0.6 per cent in 2019 and 0.7 per cent in 2020.</p>
      <p>The latest NODX slide is its eighth straight monthly drop. A high base a year ago in non-electronics exports, especially pharmaceuticals, put the decline back in double-digit territory after the NODX fell 8.1 per cent in September, reversing three consecutive months of moderating retreat.</p>
      <p>For October, non-electronics NODX sank 11 per cent, a sharper decline from the 2.3 per cent dip in September, dragged down by a high base. Pharmaceutical shipments plunged 36 per cent, while petrochemicals went down 19.2 per cent and primary chemicals tumbled 47.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>Month on month, the drop in the NODX moderated from a seasonally adusted 3.3 per cent decrease in September to 2.9 per cent last month. Non-oil re-export also declined less steeply at 2.3 per cent year-on-year.</p>
      <p>Except for Taiwan, NODX exports to all top 10 markets headed south in October, with Japan (-39.5 per cent), the European Union (-13.2 per cent) and the US (-10.5 per cent) the biggest contributors to last month's fall.</p>
