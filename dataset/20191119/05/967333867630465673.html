      <p>​Tel Aviv established military control over the Golan Heights in 1967 and annexed it in 1981, although the annexation has never been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911161077321757/">recognized by the United Nations</a>. The Golan Heights is widely seen as an exceptionally important strategic area, as it offers a clear view of both Syria and Israel.</p>
      <p>Over the last weekend, the IDF claimed that it intercepted two projectiles fired from the Palestinian Gaza enclave. The IDF claimed that they responded to the attack by <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911161077320996-idf-says-intercepted-two-rockets-fired-from-gaza-strip/">striking targets</a> of the Hamas group, which controls the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>Last week, tensions in the area increased after the killing by Tel Aviv of Baha Abu Al-Atta, a top commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in the Gaza Strip, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911121077285096-iron-dome-reportedly-intercepts-rockets-from-gaza-after-idf-claims-it-killed-islamic-jihad/">triggering multiple</a> rocket attacks from the Palestinian side. Israel reportedly conducted multiple air raids in Gaza. A ceasefire was reported later to have been achieved.</p>
