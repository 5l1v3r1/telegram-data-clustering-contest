      <p>Born to the first Prime Minister of India Pandit <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and Kamala Nehru, Indira served as the Prime Minister of the country for three terms. She was the second longest-serving PM after her father.

In one of the darkest phase of independent India, Indira had imposed a 21-month-long Emergency across the country in 1975.</p>

      <p>From ushering in green revolution to the 1971 war victory to the first nuclear test at Pokhran, India witnessed several defining moments under her leadership.</p>
      <p>Indira was assassinated by her own bodyguards at her residence in Delhi on October 31, 1984 in the aftermath of Operation Blue Star, when the Indian army stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar to flush out armed Sikh militants.</p>
