      <p>Redmi K30 to debut in December 2019 – Lei Jun<br/>5 (100%) 2 votes</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/13/alleged-redmi-k30-with-dual-5g-certified-in-china/">A lot has been floating around about Redmi’s next flagship</a> – the Redmi K30 for a while now, both from official, and unofficial sources. Just a few hours ago, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/15/lu-weibing-redmi-k30-series-will-be-released-in-2020/">Redmi General Manager Lu Weibing</a> had through a Weibo post hinted that the device won’t arrive until sometime in 2020.</p>
      <p>Well, there is a new twist to that. Xiaomi’s Lei Jun at its <a href="https://www.anzhuo.cn/news/p_37237">Developers Conference earlier</a> today in China while addressing some key 5G issues toward the release of its first 5G phone revealed that the Redmi K30 will go official in about a month’s time -in December. And, perhaps, that is when it will officially announce specs details of the device, while its actual launch might be delayed.</p>
      <p>while it again didn’t reveal spec details and even specific launch date, we know pretty well that the Redmi K20 will launch as the brand’s first 5G smartphone with dual-mode 5G support. The device has yet to leak in full however, we already had a sneak peek at the front view of the device that reveals a Galaxy S10 like design.</p>
      <p>In the render shared by Redmi general manager Lu Weibing, the Redmi K30 is seen with a <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/14/redmi-k30-to-use-a-dual-punch-hole-front-camera-and-dual-mode-5g/">pill-shaped dual punch-hole for a dual</a> front camera setup. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun also recently gave us a good idea of what the K30 will cost when it hits the market. Jun said that all of Xiaomi’s phones released in the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/15/lei-jun-in-h1-2019-all-xiaomi-phones-above-2000-yuan-285-will-support-5g/">first half of 2020 for $285 or more will offer 5G connectivity</a>. So it is safe to say the K30 will be priced below $285.</p>
      <h3>Redmi K30 SoC</h3>
      <p>A few reports suggest the device will come equipped with the Snapdragon 7 series chipset, while there is also growing speculation that the brand might opt for <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/04/redmi-k30-tipped-for-early-2020-to-get-mediateks-5g-soc/">MediaTek’s 5G SoC</a>. A Redmi K30 Pro variant is also expected to launch alongside the K30, perhaps with more RAM and storage space.</p>
