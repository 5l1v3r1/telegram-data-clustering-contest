      <p>The sky will be filled with large, round, colourful balloons at this February's Vernon Winter Carnival once again.</p>
      <p>The Hot Air Balloon Festival is coming back for its 29th year running, spanning four days.</p>
      <p>On Thursday the 6th, there will be a meet and greet with the pilots being introduced to their crews. Friday morning will be the first flight in the competition, followed by the Balloon Glow in the evening. Saturday morning will be the final flights of the competition, followed by an awards banquet on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Friday night will also have some other activities to do at the Balloon Glow.</p>
      <p>There will be a t-shirt design contest for kids aged 13-15. Those who participate will be tasked with creating a graphic design featuring a hot air balloon. The winner will be silk-screened on the festival's t-shirts.</p>
      <p>There will be Hot Air Balloon Bingo, where the goal is to get signatures from the hot air balloon pilots.</p>
      <p>The "Where's Mini" treasure hunt contest is also coming back. The mini balloon will be travelling throughout the city and people are encouraged to post a picture of themselves with Mini on the event's Facebook page.</p>
      <p>To help with costs, the B.C. Ballooning Association is looking for sponsors. To become a sponsor, you can email bcballooning@gmail.com.</p>
