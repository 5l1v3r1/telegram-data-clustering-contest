      <p>Users from different parts of the world took to Twitter on November 19 to report problems using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, including several parts in the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
      <p>According to Downdetector website, which monitors online outages, the outages did not appear to hit the entire Facebook network but several areas reported disruption in services.</p>
      <p>While 63% reported a total blackout, 19% had problems in logging in while 16% faced problems with their News Feed.</p>
      <p>“Facebook always getting hacked and now disabled... Why can’t Facebook work right. I can’t get on my new account because it was disabled,” posted an user.</p>
      <p>“Okay, is Facebook Messenger down?” posted another. Users said the Facebook app failed to send or load messages.</p>
      <p>The social networking platform was yet to identify or comment on the latest outage.</p>
      <p>Facebook and Instagram suffered a total outage in the U.K. and in some parts of Europe in September as thousands of users went on to Twitter to complain about not being able to use the social media platforms.</p>
      <p>The biggest outage Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram faced was in March that lasted for more than 14 hours. Facebook blamed a ‘database’ overload for the problem.</p>
