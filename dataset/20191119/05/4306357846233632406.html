      <h3>Danny Mills has hailed Liverpool FC captain Jordan Henderson as a “fabulous player”.</h3>
      <p>The England international has played a key role in Liverpool FC’s title challenge so far this season.</p>
      <p>Henderson scored Liverpool FC’s equaliser in a 2-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside outfit are sitting at the top of the Premier League table and eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool FC skipper helped England to qualify for Euro 2020 on Friday night after their 6-0 victory over Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Henderson was used in a holding role in the Three Lions side despite being used in a more advanced position at Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester City defender Mills spoke in glowing terms about Henderson’s versatility in midfield.</p>
      <p>“The age he’s at now, the experience that he has, the authority that he has in the middle there to play that holding role – he can still get forward, of course he can,” Mills told <i>talkSPORT</i>.</p>
      <p>“If things aren’t quite going well, he can direct the traffic.</p>
      <p>“There are better creative players ahead of him. That’s the point. Jordan Henderson is a fabulous player.</p>
      <p>“If you’re going to play one holding midfield player out and out – it’s not quite his position that he plays at Liverpool – but he would be, I think, the best player to play in that role.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC have never won the Premier League title despite finishing in second place on four different occasions.</p>
      <p>Henderson has finished as a Premier League runner up on two different occasions under Brendan Rodgers and Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old lifted the Champions League trophy last season thanks to 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC singed Henderson in a £20m deal from Sunderland under Kenny Dalglish in 2011.</p>
      <p>Henderson has scored one goal and has made one assist in 11 games in the Premier League.</p>
