      <p>A fire at a Cambellfield factory has revealed a hydroponic marijuana set up.</p>
      <p>Kaylene told 3AW’s Tom Elliott a suspicious smelling fire was burning in what she believed was a caravan factory.</p>
      <p>“We always thought it fronted as a caravan factory, but apparently they’ve been storing other things,” she said.</p>
      <p>Emergency services were called to the fire at a Merola Way factory just after midday.</p>
      <p>Upon extinguishing the blaze they found a hydroponic set up with a large number of cannabis plants.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fire is ongoing.</p>
