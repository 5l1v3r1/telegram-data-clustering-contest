      <p>Besides <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/vivo-realme-xiaomi-samsung-india-smartphone-market-growth-q12019/">disrupting the smartphone market</a> with its tempting prices, Xiaomi has also taken a good share of the smart TV sales with its Mi TV lineup. These Mi TVs are incredibly popular majorly in the South East Asian markets. The Mi TV 4A, which was launched in 2018 with Patchwall UI based on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/android-nougat/">Android Nougat</a>, should soon be getting an update to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/androidpie/">Android Pie</a>-based OS. Ahead of the update, Xiaomi has announced a pilot testing program for the Android Pie update on the Mi TV 4A 32-inch and 43-inch models and is seeking early testers for the update.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>This is big news for the Mi TV 4A users since the update brings essential <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/android-tv/">Android TV</a> features such as the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-plans-redesign-play-store-android-tv/">Google Play Store</a>, other Google Play apps, as well as the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-assistant/">Google Assistant</a>. Xiaomi does not that since these TVs don’t support BLE, you won’t be able to use the Google Assistant even if you buy a new remote with a dedicated Assistant button but, you can use any <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/connected-home/google-home">Google Home</a> device or the Home app to trigger the Assistant. The update will also bring inbuilt Chromecast support and hopefully a Full HD playback option in the native YouTube app.</p>

      <p>Xiaomi’s Product Manager, Sudeep Sahu, calls this a giant leap and it is right so since these features were unavailable on the Xiaomi smart TVs in the Mi TV 4A series, forcing users to rely on alternatives like the Aptoide TV app store. Thus, in spite of being based on Android, these TVs weren’t on par with other Android TVs in terms of the app support and that vexed buyers. Xiaomi launched the successor Mi TV 4A PRO series with a full-fledged Android TV experience and since then, it has received many requests for updating the older models to a similar experience.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi has skipped the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/android-oreo/">Android Oreo</a> update for the Mi TV 4A models and with the Pie update, the roll-out of latest security patches should also become more convenient for Xiaomi’s engineers. Besides the Android update, we also expect these TVs to be getting <a href="https://twitter.com/MiTVIndia/status/1123903601343180801">Patchwall 2.0</a> interface which was recently rolled out for the newer TVs. The ETA for the stable update has not been released for now and should depend on the feedback from the users.</p>
      <p>For now, Xiaomi is only selecting 50 users for this early access program and if you wish to get a chance to be one of them, fill the form below before the midnight of July 21st.</p>

      <h3>Update 1: Mi TV 4A certified for Android, stable OTA expected soon</h3>
      <p>Xiaomi’s first-gen TVs in India i.e. 32-inch and 43-inch variants of the Mi TV 4A, with a codename, “magnolia,” have been added to the list of devices <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131?hl=en">certified by Google to run Android</a>. This hints that we can expect to roll out the Android TV upgrade based on Android Pie to the TVs soon. The update seemingly took longer than expected since the TVs originally came with AOSP-based firmware but not certified for the Android TV program.</p>
      <p>The update will bring support for the Google Play Store, Data Saver feature for the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-launches-65-inch-4k-mi-tv/">Mi TV 4X</a> series, but Netflix support may still remain elusive. Meanwhile, the Mi TV 4A hasn’t appeared on the Google Play Console yet. We’ll inform you when Xiaomi officially confirms the roll-out of the Android Pie update for these TVs.</p>

      <h3>Update 2: Official roll-out announcement</h3>
      <p>Xiaomi has officially announced that the Android Pie update for the 43″ and 32″ Mi TV 4A is now rolling out. The update will roll out in a phased manner so you might not see the update instantly.</p>
