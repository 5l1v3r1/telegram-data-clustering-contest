      <p>By Stanley Goreraza| I’ll never forget how grown men would be emasculated, degraded and abused in front of their families and the eyes of the nation at what was called “Interface Rallies”. They do not know it, but G40 , actually embarrassed themselves more than their hapless victims at those rallies and other forums. What was done by G40 to Mai Mujuru, Ray Kaukonde, Charamba and so many others could have been easily done to anyone of us.</p>
      <p>They showed us all that they have no dignity, maturity, compunction, composure and control. They showed us that they, G40, enjoy watching people on their knees, grovelling and begging them.</p>
      <p>So if Kasukuwere is to lead Zimbabwe, you can expect to live your life on your knees, maybe begging for medicines in hospitals, begging for a decent living and maybe even your right to life among other rights! Maybe you’ll get some of the treatment Ray Kaukonde got. Maybe you will be called a witch like Mai Mujuru.</p>
      <p>So before we think Tyson “Wabantu” and General Chiwenga are going to liberate us, we might want to reflect and educate ourselves!</p>
