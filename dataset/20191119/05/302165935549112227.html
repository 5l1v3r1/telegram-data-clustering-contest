      <p>BEIJING, Nov 19 — A coal mine explosion killed 15 people in north China's Shanxi province, state media reported today.</p>
      <p>Nine other people were injured by the gas explosion yesterday afternoon, which took place in a mine owned by Shangxi Pingyao Fengyan Coal &amp; Coke Group Co, according to official news agency Xinhua.</p>
      <p>Xinhua reported that 35 miners were working underground when the blast happened, but 11 miners were able to escape.</p>
      <p>The injured miners were in stable condition and authorities were investigating the cause of the explosion, Xinhua said.</p>
      <p>Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record.</p>
      <p>At a meeting last week, the State Council — China's cabinet — ordered a “special crackdown on production-related safety issues” to “further improve workplace safety,” Xinhua reported.</p>
      <p>In December 2018, seven miners were killed in southwestern Chongqing municipality after the connecting segment of a mining skip broke and fell down a mine shaft.</p>
      <p>In October 2018, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping the workers. Only one miner was rescued alive.</p>
      <p>In December 2016, explosions in two separate coal mines in the Inner Mongolia region and in northeastern Heilongjiang province killed at least 59 people. — AFP</p>
