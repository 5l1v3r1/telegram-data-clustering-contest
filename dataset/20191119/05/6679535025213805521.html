      <p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday condoled the deaths of Army personnel and porters in an <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eight-member-army-patrol-missing-after-getting-hit-by-avalanche/article30008398.ece?homepage=true">avalanche on the Siachen Glacier</a>.</p>
      <p>Four Army personnel and two civilian porters were killed after they were hit by an avalanche in northern part of the Siachen Glacier Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Deeply pained by the demise of soldiers and porters due to avalanche in Siachen. I salute their courage and service to the nation. My heartfelt condolences to their families,” Mr. Singh tweeted.</p>
      <p>A group of eight persons, including six Army personnel, were struck by the avalanche at an altitude of 19,000 ft around 3 p.m., an official said.</p>
      <p>Rescue teams from nearby posts were rushed to the location after the incident. Two Army personnel survived the avalanche, he said.</p>
      <p>“All eight personnel were pulled out of the avalanche debris. Seven individuals were critically injured in the incident,” the official said.</p>
      <p>Despite best efforts, four soldiers and two civilian porters succumbed to extreme hypothermia, he said.</p>
      <p>The Siachen Glacier at a height of around 20,000 ft in the Karakoram range is known as the highest militarised zone in the world where the soldiers have to battle frostbite and high winds.</p>
      <p>Avalanches and landslides are common at the glacier during the winters and temperatures can drop to as low as minus 60 degree Celsius.</p>
