      <p>Through the project, dubbed—Transforming Tanzania's Charcoal Sector (TTCS) the villagers were able to collect 63m/- from levies imposed in the charcoal business operated under the project.</p>
      <p>Presenting project report to journalists recently in Diguzi village, Morogoro Regional Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Amini Dico said the 63m/- was collected in the 2018/2019 fiscal year.</p>
      <p>He said the project was introduced to the villagers in 2016 although it started in 2015. It gave opportunity to villagers to conserve natural forests in collaboration with the district council.</p>
      <p>“The villagers are conserving the natural forests but also benefiting with emerged economic opportunities that helps boost their income,” he added noting they had agreed to use the funds obtained from the business to improve social services.</p>
      <p>Dico informed that the village’s health centre has been installed with solar power at a cost of 1m/- to facilitate medical services during day time and night.</p>
      <p>He said, some 13m/- were allocated for construction of teacher houses and 1m/- for construction of toilets at the village executive officer’s office.</p>
      <p>“The project has been one of the most important and influential initiative that support and develop various basic social services in the village,” Dico said adding that it has also resulted into creation of jobs to youth engaged in charcoal production.</p>
      <p>The TTCS project is implemented by Tanzania Forest Conservation Group (TFCG) in collaboration with TaTEDO and Mjumita under the support of Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).</p>
      <p>It is designed to enable and support policy and existing institutional framework, environment sustainability and pro-poor charcoal and other forest product value chains.</p>
      <p>As part of project implementation, TFCG organised a two-day training to journalists on sustainable charcoal production.</p>
      <p>TFCG capacity building officer, Saimon Lugazo said the project is a partnership initiative, focusing on climate resilient transformation of the economy and governance of charcoal and other forest product value chains.</p>
      <p>The project which ends in 2019 is being implemented in 30 villages in four districts namely, Morogoro, Kilosa, Mvomero and Morogoro Rural.</p>
      <p>“Political support from central and local governments is needed to scale up this initiative into other regions,” he noted.</p>
      <p>According to Lugazo, the project has so far been able to produce charcoal which is sold at competitive prices within participating villages. He said villagers have also established a harvesting protocol aligned with ecologically sustainable woodland management.</p>
