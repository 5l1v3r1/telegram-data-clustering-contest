      <p>Dr Ndugulile made the call when speaking at a three-day 1st national NDCs conference held in Morogoro Municipality recently.</p>
      <p>“We are calling on health personnel to educate people on the importance of following health tips considering that some of the non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer and high blood pressure can somehow be prevented by avoiding certain foods and also by doing physical exercises,” the deputy minister suggested.</p>
      <p>He said that the country needs quality health services considering that only healthy people can contribute to the development of the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, NCDs remain a global growing problem, including in Africa and in low-income countries like Tanzania.</p>
      <p>The NCD burden constitutes one of the major challenges to socioeconomic development as it causes a big burden to both the economy and to the health care systems.</p>
      <p>NCDs accounted for an estimated 36 million deaths, or 63 per cent of the 57 million deaths that occurred globally in 2008, comprising mainly cardiovascular diseases (48 per cent), cancers (21 per cent), chronic respiratory diseases (12 per cent) and diabetes (3.5 per cent) will lead as top killer than HIV to Sub Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p>Director of curative services in the ministry of Health, Grace Magembe said the government has launched sports programmes as part of measures to address NCDs.</p>
      <p>“We’re also encouraging people to do regular exercises,” she said.</p>
      <p>Executive officer of the Dar es Salaam-based Shree Hindu Mandal Hospital, Prof Kaushik Ramaiya suggested the need for researchers to venture into more studies that would come up with measures to address non-communicable diseases (NDCs), since prevention is better than cure.</p>
