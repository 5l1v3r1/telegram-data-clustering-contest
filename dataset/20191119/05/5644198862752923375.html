      <p>NEW YORK: Another woman sued the estate of Jeffrey Epstein in Manhattan federal court on Monday (Nov 18), saying the late financier subjected her to a "vicious, prolonged sexual assault" at his New Mexico ranch when she was 15.</p>
      <p>The woman, now 31, spoke at a news conference along with her lawyer Gloria Allred, but used the pseudonym Jane Doe to safeguard her privacy, the lawsuit said.</p>

      <p>More than a dozen women have sued Epstein's estate. Epstein hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the estate's executors could not be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>Doe, who grew up in a poor family in the Midwest, met Epstein's secretary during a 2004 school trip to New York City. The secretary later invited her to view a magic show in Las Vegas and then fly to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in his private jet, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>The secretary said Epstein was interested in helping girls who were in difficult circumstances, and when Doe arrived, Epstein summoned her to give him a massage alone, and then sexually assaulted her, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>The executors Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn last week said they would seek to create a compensation fund for victims. The proposal must be approved by a court in the US Virgin Islands, which is overseeing the estate.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, died two days after signing a will and putting his estimated US$577 million estate into a trust. The financier once counted US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew as friends.</p>
