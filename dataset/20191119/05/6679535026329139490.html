      <p>The teaser of<i> Chusi Chudangane </i>featuring producer Raj Kandukuri’s son Siva and Varsha Bollamma as the lead pair, has given rise to speculation that it could be a rip off of the Hindi film <i>Wake Up Sid</i>. Varsha is quick to deny, “Not at all. The overall look might have given people that feeling, but it story isn’t that. There is another heroine played by Malvika Sateeshan,” she says.</p>
      <p>Varsha may be new to Telugu audience but she has had two Tamil hits, <i>96</i> and <i>Bigil</i> (<i>Whistle</i> in Telugu). The producers of <i>Chusi Chudangane </i>saw her in <i>96</i> and offered her the film. She reveals that her role in <i>Chusi Chudangane</i> is of a drummer, something she has never attempted before, and she thoroughly enjoyed playing the part. She adds, “Once I began playing the drums, I noticed the instrument gives a lot of freedom and there is power to it. I am part of a music troupe and the music director as well. It is not a sweet role though, am a little bold. The director was sceptical because he thought I have an innocent face but once the workshop started, they were happy.”</p>
      <p>Varsha was a part of school plays, but when she auditioned for dramatics at college, she wasn’t selected. That left her heart broken. She recalls, “I remember imitating Aamir Khan and people cheering me. People who were selected didn’t get that kind of applause; that happened when I was in the XII Std.”</p>
      <p>The vivacious Coorgi girl always wanted to be an actor. Her friend tagged her onto a FB page of a casting agency and she was immediately called for an audition and got selected for a Tamil film. In <i>Whistle</i> she plays a traditional Brahmin girl who puts her passion for football on the backburner and resigns herself to being a homemaker. After the film released, lot of people messaged her that they could connect with her character. Even boys texted that their mother went through the same situation and they will make sure their wife won’t have to go through it again.</p>
      <p>Talk about the irony of working with Vijay in <i>Whistle</i> and another Vijay (Sethupati) in <i>96</i> in the initial stages of her career, she quips, “I don’t know which Vijay is in line next! When you work with them, you know why they are superstars. Even after they are reaching the level they are in, their consistent dedication inspires you.”</p>
      <p>With her flair for languages, Varsha finds it easy to straddle fim industries in the south. She is currently working in a film featuring Anand Deverakonda as the hero. The director Vinod is a newcomer and was initially trying to find a Telugu speaking girl since he was planning to make the film in sync sound. Finally he roped in Varsha but got her part dubbed. “I grasp things quite well, the role calls for a Guntur dialect and I dubbed for it. But sync sound is tough; if my expressions came out well, modulation wouldn’t be good. Five to six takes for each shot is not a good thing, so I’m glad it didn’t happen. Even when I was dubbing for it, I felt it was entering an exam hall. Getting back all those emotions, the feel you had while performing is tough. But the end result is satisfying.”</p>
