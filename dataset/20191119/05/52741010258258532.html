      <p>MONTREAL — About 3,200 Canadian National Railway conductors, trainpersons and yard workers are on strike after the union and company failed to reach a deal by the midnight deadline.</p>
      <p>The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, the union representing the employees, gave the required 72-hour strike notice on the weekend.</p>
      <p>Union spokesman Christopher Monette says they are still in talks with CN in hopes of reaching a negotiated settlement and ending the labour dispute as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The union has said passenger rail services in the country's three biggest cities would not be affected by the strike.</p>
      <p>It represents workers at commuter rail services including Go Transit in Toronto, Exo in Montreal and the West Coast Express in Vancouver, where passengers would remain unaffected.</p>
      <p>The workers, who have been without a contract since July 23, say they're concerned about long hours, fatigue and what they consider dangerous working conditions.</p>
      <p>The dispute comes as CN confirmed Friday that it was cutting jobs across the railway as it deals with a weakening North American economy that has eroded demand.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 19, 2019.</p>
