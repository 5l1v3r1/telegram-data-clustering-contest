      <p>On tonight's edition of Monday Night RAW, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/charlotte-flair">Charlotte Flair </a>was <a href="https://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2019/woman-survivor-series-elimination-triple-threat-match">revealed </a>as the Red brand's team captain for the 15-woman Triple Threat Elimination Match at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series 2019</a>. The other four members of Team RAW were also announced.</p>
      <p>At Survivor Series 2019, all three <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>brands will collide in a series of Triple Threat matches. For years now, we have seen Monday Night RAW and Friday Night SmackDown face off in interbrand matches at Survivor Series. This time though, NXT will join in on the fun and try to reign supreme over the main roster brands.</p>
