      <p>The scheme worth 75m/- is one of several irrigation systems being constructed in the region by the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) serving a number of acres.</p>
      <p>The project’s chairman Boniface Ndau told journalists who visited the area in the village that the construction of the scheme enables farmers to grow crops throughout the year.</p>
      <p>“The project has brought a huge relief to a number of farmers who have been struggling for years to get enough water for their crops,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said that the farmers in the fields grow maize, beans, rice and different types of horticultural crops.</p>
      <p>“We commenced construction of the 600 meter canal in March to July, this year, we hired a contractor to execute the project in close support from TASAF beneficiaries…the project has addressed a long conflict among farmers who were fighting to get water,” Ndau added.</p>
      <p>Mang’ola ward extension officer, Christopher Kazibila said apart from improving irrigation schemes, they have been training the farmers on proper utilisation of water resources.</p>
      <p>He further noted that investing in irrigation could help the country feed the population and boost economic growth.</p>
      <p>Kazibila further noted that to combat the effects of climate change, integrated strategies were needed. One of them is investing in sustainable irrigation that recognises the role of farmers and the challenges they face in developing the sector.</p>
      <p>“Irrigation is a promising way of raising agricultural productivity. It increases farm yields mightily, allowing two crops to be cultivated at a go and it allows crops to be grown throughout the year…So we hope that with this infrastructure, our farmers will no longer face water scarcity,” he added.</p>
      <p>Reports show that only 5 percent of the country’s 29.4 million hectares of land that could be irrigated are currently under irrigation.</p>
      <p>Experts have aired their views that since rain-fed agriculture is affected by drought and floods that will likely be exacerbated by climate change, impacting significantly on both the national economy and smallholder farmers’ vulnerability to food insecurity, investing in irrigation development is crucial.</p>
