      <h1>Huawei is getting three more months before US ban takes effect</h1>
      <h2>Yet another delay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:08:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/colin-lecher" target="_blank">Colin Lecher</a></address>
      <p>Huawei has been given yet another reprieve from the Trump administration’s ban on its products, according to Commerce Department <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-25189.pdf">documents filed today</a>.</p>
      <aside>Yet another delay</aside>
      <p>Earlier this year, citing concerns of electronic espionage, the United States moved to restrict the purchase of equipment from “foreign adversaries.” The decision took aim directly at Huawei, as officials expressed concern that the Chinese government could exploit the China-based company to spy on Americans. (The company has denied any wrongdoing.)</p>
      <p>But after the initial announcement, Huawei and its subsidiaries were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department">quickly granted licenses</a> to continue work in the US. And after one 90-day delay ended in August, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20811937/huawei-ban-delay-90-days-rural-telecom-wilbur-ross">granted another</a>, giving rural wireless carriers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652769/huawei-china-security-rural-internet-rip-replace">that rely on Huawei products</a> time to change their equipment.</p>
      <p>The delay was again set to end this week, but according to the documents, the US will grant another extension. Barring yet another change, the ban is now set to take effect after February 16th, 2020.</p>
      <p>“Extending the Temporary General License won’t have a substantial impact on Huawei’s business either way,” a Huawei spokesperson said in a statement. “This decision does not change the fact that Huawei continues to be treated unfairly.”</p>
      <p>The newest delay comes amid the continuing trade negotiations between the US and China. Despite lawmakers expressing national security concerns, President Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637836/trump-huawei-ban-explanation-trade-deal-national-security-risk">has suggested</a> that Huawei’s fate could be part of a trade deal with China.</p>
