      <h1>Audi RS Q8, RS5 Panther Edition To Debut At Los Angeles Auto Show</h1>
      <h2>These will be joined on stage by the RS6, RS7, and a trio of S models.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:01:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>We kind of assumed it was coming, but it’s nice to hear it straight from the horse’s mouth. Audi has announced its <a href="https://www.motor1.com/auto-show/la-auto-show/">2019 Los Angeles Auto Show</a> presence will be chockfull of performance models, including a world premiere with the first-ever RS Q8. After setting a new record for the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/380627/audi-rs-q8-nurburgring-record/">fastest SUV at the Nürburgring</a>, the big daddy of RS SUVs from Audi Sport will be unveiled in full tomorrow, November 20.</p>
      <p>Audi Sport isn’t willing to spill the beans about its flagship <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/suv-crossover/">SUV</a> just yet, but it does reveal the vehicle will feature a twin-turbo eight-cylinder engine hooked up to a Quattro all-wheel-drive system with a sport differential. The RS Q8 has also been confirmed to feature rear-wheel steering and electromechanical active roll stabilization, but that’s all <a href="https://www.motor1.com/audi/">Audi</a> is willing to share for the time being.</p>

      <p>Much like the RS6 Avant and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/370868/audi-rs7-official-detail-video/">RS7 Sportback</a> also due to be shown in L.A., the RS Q8 will use a 4.0-liter V8 widely expected to offer the same 592 horsepower and 590 pound-feet (800 Newton-meters) of torque. The sporty luxobarge will do 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.8 seconds and max out at 190 mph (306 km/h), according to a recent report.</p>
      <p>A big <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/suv-crossover/">SUV</a> looks good on big wheels, therefore Audi will offer a 23-inch set wrapped in 295/35 ZR23 Pirelli P Zero tires. The engineers have stiffened up the suspension compared to the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/356071/audi-sq8-europe-launch-turbodiesel/">SQ8</a> and have likely applied other tweaks to make the performance SUV worthy of its RS badge and the hefty premium it will command.</p>

      <p>The RS Q8 will be joined on stage by a couple of other debuts, including the production version of the E-Tron Sportback. Another premiere will be the RS5 Panther Edition due to be offered only in 100 examples – 25 coupes and 75 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/audi/rs5-sportback/">Sportbacks</a>. All will be painted in a fancy Audi Exclusive Panther Black crystal effect paint and will ride on two-tone 20-inch wheels with a five-spoke design borrowed from the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/374047/2020-audi-rs4-avant-arrives/">RS4 Avant</a>.</p>
      <p>Created to "emphasize design elements of the high performance and distinct RS model," the Panther Edition will be visually distinguishable thanks to its RS interior design package featuring black Alcantara elements, representing a first for an RS model sold in the United States. These will be noticeable on the steering wheel and the sides of the center console and will be contrasted by red stitching and a red edge for the black seatbelts.</p>

The five-passenger SUV coupe is capable of impressive driving dynamics and is equipped with standard electric quattro® all-wheel drive to help provide exceptional control and confidence in a variety of situations.</p>
        <p>From the inside out, in keeping with the brand’s e-mobility philosophy, the e-tron Sportback continues the approach of a design oriented toward repeatable performance, longevity and peak charging power. The second fully electric model from the brand provides the fit and finish that luxury buyers expect in the segment.

The high-performance wagon offers visceral design, exhilarating driving dynamics and everyday functionality for the driving enthusiast.

More pronounced wheel arches on the five-passenger, five-door coupe emphasize a lowered stance and captivating design. The RS 7 Sportback will be equipped with a V8 bi-turbo engine and standard performance hardware to ensure maximum performance and precise driving agility.</p>
        <p><b>Audi RS Q8: performance SUV<br/></b>Invigorating the performance model line, the Audi RS Q8, the first RS SUV in the U.S. will make its global debut at the LA Auto Show. Powered by an eight-cylinder twin-turbo engine, equipped with quattro® sport differential, all-wheel steering, and electromechanical active roll stabilization, the Audi RS Q8 recently became the fastest production SUV to lap the renowned Nürburgring racetrack with an official time of 7 minutes and 42.2 seconds.</p>
