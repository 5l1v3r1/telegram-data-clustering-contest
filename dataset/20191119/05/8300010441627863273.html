      <p>AVALON, Calif. (KABC) -- When it comes to boat rides, a couple of kids and their dog have a whale of a tale to tell.<br/><br/>They were boating with their father in Avalon Harbor in Catalina when a whale surfaced right next to them.<br/><br/>The dog was perched right at the bow of the vessel as the whale splashed around.<br/><br/>Tour operators offer whale watching trips off the coast of Catalina, but for this show, you didn't need a ticket and you didn't have to leave the harbor.</p>
