      <h1>MTA negligence led to 2018 Borough Hall ceiling collapse, audit shows</h1>

      <p>The MTA knew about a key flaw in its station inspection procedures for nearly a decade that could have prevented <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/20/woman-injured-as-subway-station-ceiling-falls-apart/">the dramatic roof collapse</a> at Brooklyn’s Borough Hall station last year, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>MTA inspector general Carolyn Pokorny found the transit bureaucracy failed to follow recommendations made by her department after a similar 2010 collapse at the 181st Street (1-Train) station in Washington Heights.</p>
      <p>Pokorny’s audit found that MTA inspectors repeatedly flagged the crumbling roof conditions at the Borough Hall station — only to then determine that immediate repairs were not required.</p>
      <p>Her office chalked up that missed call to the agency’s failure to hire outside experts to examine the station’s unique terra cotta-tiled ceiling experts, as recommended after the Washington Heights collapse.</p>
      <p>“Had the recommendations issued in our 2010 report been fully implemented, it is likely that the extensive station damage and costly repairs could have been reduced, if not prevented,” she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Pokorny determined that the $8.3 million the MTA spent on installing a new protective net to catch falling ceiling debris would have been “unnecessary” if the agency made the repairs requested in the first place.</p>
      <p>“The responsibility for properly evaluating the risk should have been transferred to others better qualified to assess it, which likely would have resulted in a timely and less-costly repair,” Pokorny wrote in the report.</p>
      <p>Thirteen of the MTA’s 472 subway stations feature terra cotta tile, according to the tally produced by MTA engineers after IG investigators called them out for not having one.</p>
      <p>The Borough Hall station is in line for renovation beginning December 2021.</p>
      <p>The MTA defended its $8 million dollar nets in a statement that did not address the inspector general’s overall findings.</p>
      <p>“When the century-old Borough Hall station ceiling proved defective, engineers assessed the materials involved, shielding the structure, until a full rehabilitation could begin as part of the new capital plan,” said agency spokesman Tim Minton.</p>
