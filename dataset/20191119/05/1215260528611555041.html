      <p>The Gleaner understands that officials from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Information met with the family of seven-year-old Benjamin Bair yesterday at the Clan Carthy Primary School in Kingston to discuss funeral arrangements.</p>
      <p>Bair was killed late last month when a garbage truck that was collecting waste from a skip on the school compound mysteriously set in motion, crashing into a parked taxi, injuring a female parent, before overturning on the youngster as he waited to be taken home.</p>
      <p>A ministry source told <b>The Gleaner</b> last night that the family has still not received invoices from the funeral home.</p>
      <p>“We basically are at the same position, where we are awaiting invoices to be able to go through the process. The meeting was chaired by [acting] Permanent Secretary Grace McLean and there were other ministry representatives, including a legal officer, and it was to assure the mother of the Government’s commitment to cover the cost of the funeral,” <b>The Gleaner</b> was told.</p>
      <p>Once the ministry receives the necessary paperwork, the source explained that the ministry would assist with processing the invoices and pass them on to the relevant agency to facilitate payment.</p>
      <p>When contacted last night, Bair's mother, Japhene Campbell, was unable to speak to our news team as she still is finding it hard to cope with her son's untimely demise.</p>
      <p>A family member with whom <b>The Gleaner</b> spoke declined to comment on how preparations for the funeral were progressing.</p>
