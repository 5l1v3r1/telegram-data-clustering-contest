      <p>Sold by the same vendors, both buildings changed hands for the first time in 40 years to investors willing to pay sharp yields of around 3 per cent.</p>
      <p>A four-storey building at 418-420 Bourke Street – occupied by retailer Peter Jackson – was snapped up for $5.57 million after 34 bids from two potential buyers.</p>
      <p>It sold on a 2.81 per cent yield at a land rate of $33,155 per square metre.</p>
      <p>Next door, a classic two-storey building at 422-424 Bourke Street exchanged for $5.6 million under the hammer following 55 bids from five parties on a 3.01 per cent yield.</p>

      <p>The deal valued the land at $31,461 per square metre.</p>
      <p>Both properties sold through Colliers International’s Daniel Wolman, Oliver Hay, David Sia and Chris Ling in conjunction with Peter Lane of Lane Commercial Property.</p>
      <p>Mr Wolman said the Bourke Street location and high pedestrian traffic sparked serious competition from a diverse group of buyers.</p>
      <p>“These auctions represented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire one of two stunning trophy assets in the heart of the Melbourne CBD,” he said.</p>
      <p>In February a three-storey building leased to Japanese cosmetics store Hello Day at 185-187 Bourke Street, owned by two Sydney-based investors, sold off-market for $9.8 million.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Auski-leased building on the corner of Bourke and Hardware Lane sold at auction for $11.57 million on a yield of 2.8 per cent.</p>
