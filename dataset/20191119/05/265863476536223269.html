      <h1>Kim Kardashian Makes Her ’90s Infomercial Dreams Come True’ With Hilarious Video Ahead Of SKIMS Restock</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:29:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:29</time> by <a rel="author">Suzy Kerr</a></address>
      <p><i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> star <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/kim-kardashian-reveals-what-it-was-like-to-sit-in-on-rodney-reed-hearing-341912/">Kim Kardashian</a> is a wife and mom of four, a successful business woman, a reality star, a law student, and a passionate political activist. But, the 39-year-old also has a fantastic sense of humor, and it was on full display this week when the business mogul released hilarious new clips promoting her SKIMS restock that looked like a 90s infomercial. The video clips featured her mom Kris Jenner, as well as <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> stars Lisa Rinna and Kyle Richards, singing the praises of SKIMS, and they will absolutely make your day.</p>
      <p>Kardashian’s SKIMS shapewear line has been so successful since its September launch that most items are completely sold out and have a waiting list ahead of the full brand restock, which is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20th.</p>

      <p>In addition to the restock, Kardashian is also releasing new styles in the SKIMS line. And, to promote the new products, the KUWK star has released a 90s-inspired infomercial complete with everything from a working toll-free number (1-716-SKIMSTV), a laugh track, and product demonstrations from a model named Chanel.</p>
      <p>“The following is a paid advertisement brought to you by SKIMS Solutionwear. Act fast, join the waitlist at SKIMS.COM to be the first to shop the restock on November 20 at 9am PST / 12pm EST #showyourskims,” wrote Jenner in the caption of a video clip she posted on Instagram.</p>
      <p>On Kardashian’s page, she thanked Rinna and Richards for making her “90s infomercial dreams come true.”</p>

      <p>Jenner plays the host of the infomercial, and Rinna and Richards are the celebrity guests there to endorse the brand. Featuring bestsellers like the Sculpting Bodysuit, Sculpting Bra, Sculpting High Waist Brief, and the Solution Short, Richards raves about how the products feel and Rinna loves that the products aren’t too tight, like other shapewear.</p>
      <p>One week after launching boob tape and pasties, Kim Kardashian absolutely slays with her marketing strategy for her restock.</p>
      <p>New episodes of <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> air Sunday nights on E!. And, new episodes of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills – featuring Kyle Richards and Lisa Rinna – will return to Bravo in 2020.</p>
