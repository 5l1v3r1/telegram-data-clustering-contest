      <p><i>Bala</i> is continuing with its victory stride as good hold was demonstrated on Monday. The film is doing quite well at the box office and that was seen yet again as <b>2.25 crores</b> more came in. The film has been performing well especially at the multiplexes where the target audience lies. So while <i>Marjaavaan </i>is keeping the single screens happy, <i>Bala</i> is working well with the multiplexes.</p>
      <p>So far, the Dinesh Vijan production has accumulated <b>92.99 crores</b> and though at one point it had seemed that the film would enter the <b>100 Crore</b> Club in two weeks flat, now it would happen in 15 or at maximum 16 days.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, the film is still a clean Super Hit and Ayushmann Khurranna would be closing the year with a high. With <i>Article 15, Dream Girl</i> and now <i>Bala</i> being wonderful successes, Ayushmann has joined the list of elite superstars who have managed a hattrick of hits in a single year.</p>
