      <p>US based Lead Impact University said the recognition was made because of Mwangakaba’s efforts in helping his community to improve its living standards through introduction of innovative banking products.</p>
      <p>“Through his strong leadership as a Managing Director of Maendeleo Bank Plc, the community has engendered significant economic benefits. In its six years of operations, Maendeleo Bank has supported the creation of self-reliant communities by empowering and enabling them to grow,” the university said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Lead Impact University further stated that through the bank, Mwangalaba has unlocked the productive and entrepreneurial potential of poor and vulnerable communities with the lives of over 10,000 common people impacted through entrepreneurial training and financing opportunities.</p>
      <p>Speaking after receiving the doctorate degree, Mwangalaba expressed his appreciation to the university administration after recognising his efforts. “It is my great pleasure to be associated with this institution, particularly for bestowing on me this honorary doctorate degree. I thank the Chancellor, the Council and the Senate of this university for giving me this great honour and this will ignite me for more commitments to serve the community and the nation for a better society,” he noted.</p>
      <p>“By the grace of God, I accept it humbly, both for myself, my country and also on behalf of all the people with whom I have worked for the last 25 years. I admit that my passion is to serve people; I love serving people. God has gifted me with a high level of humility and a passion for working with people who need my attention,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mwangalaba is a certified instructor with Joseph Business School - a USA-based Institution in partnership with Kingdom Leadership Institute based in Dar es Salaam which offers ethical leadership and entrepreneurship training programs.</p>
      <p>Among other places, Mwangalaba has worked with CRDB Bank Plc and KCB Bank Tanzania for over six years in each. Maendeleo Bank which started operations in September 2013 has been under Mwangalaba as founding Managing Director.</p>
