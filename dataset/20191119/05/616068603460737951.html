      <p>A formerly homeless man says he's frustrated with the homeless population on Leon Avenue in downtown Kelowna because he can't properly access the Gospel Mission, due to being in a wheelchair.</p>
      <p>Doug Klassen uses the Gospel Mission to access grocery services and also enjoys interacting with friends and staff there.</p>
      <p>"I've been homeless once upon a time many years ago, and I access the Gospel Mission, as I'm on a very tight budget," said Klassen.</p>
      <p>He says the growing homeless camp on the street regularly has tents on the curb cuts, making it impossible for him to get onto the sidewalk to enter the Mission.</p>
      <p>"I'm not being able to access the services anymore... I gotta fight to get tents moved," said Klassen.</p>
      <p>"I've asked staff to move them, I've phoned bylaw, bylaw phones the police, the police come and talk to me, and that's it. Twenty minutes later when everyone leaves, it's the same story."</p>
      <p>Klassen has experienced altercations with the homeless as a result of asking them to move, and it has taken upwards of 30 minutes at times to find someone to move a tent.</p>
      <p>"I've been told to go around. I would love to go around, but theres no curb cuts," he said.</p>
      <p>Klassen also believes <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/270337/homeless-are-still-human">the demands</a> listed during a recent press conference held on Leon Avenue with a group called Alliance Against Displacement were over the top.</p>
      <p>"I understand the plight and their fight, but they're asking for a lot," said Klassen. </p>
      <p>The demands included a request for the city to purchase a hotel to house the homeless and to install electrical outlets at each tent.</p>
      <p>"I want to be homeless if they're going to get a hotel room paid for. I've had to pay my way... you gotta have some responsibility," said Klassen. "They were talking about having power to every tent – now were starting to talk like a campground."</p>
      <p>"This isn't a campground, they're homeless. I sympathize with the fact that they're sleeping on the streets, but you also have to make that effort to find your housing."</p>
      <p>Klassen hopes the City of Kelowna will make changes on Leon Avenue because he believes the homelessness issue has progressed over the last two years.</p>
      <p>Mark Burley, executive director of the Downtown Kelowna Association, agrees the Alliance Against Displacement group's demands are unreasonable.</p>
      <p>"People come from another city ... making demands ... basically creating an issue that doesn't need to be an issue," said Burley.</p>
      <p>Burley said it's not DKA's responsibility to address the demands of a group from somewhere else.</p>
      <p>"With those people coming here, what they're basically doing is lighting a match and throwing it into a bucket of gasoline for absolutely no reason at all," said Burley.</p>
      <p>Burley suggests anyone who is having difficulty accessing the sidewalks should seek downtown on-call personnel, who wear red and black uniforms and are usually in the area. These personnel can then contact the appropriate authorities to make the sidewalks accessible.</p>
      <p>"He has every right to have that access," said Burley. "We all have the right to have access to the sidewalk." </p>
      <p>It's expected access to sidewalks on Leon Avenue will increase once winter mat programs begin.</p>
