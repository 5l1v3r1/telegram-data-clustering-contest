      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technically, Mastercard stock price looks balanced.</li>
        <li>Both the current revenue growth rate and its absolute size describe the company's current capitalization level as overvalued.</li>
        <li>But Mastercard is clearly undervalued in terms of profitability.</li>
        <li>The stock price is more responsive to the overall growth of the stock market than to its decline. That is a very positive sign.</li>

          <b>1. Technical Parameters</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Starting from 2009, Mastercard (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA">MA</a>) stock price has been following its long-term exponential trend, which is pretty typical of a growing public company:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Since the beginning of the year, the company's actual stock price has been growing almost in line with this trend. This means balanced growth dynamics of the company's capitalization.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-1574086120802546.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Throughout the year, Mastercard's rolling annual total price return indicator has been fluctuating around the average. It also points to the balanced state of the company's stock price dynamics.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Technically, now Mastercard stock price is balanced.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Growth Drivers</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are several strong and long-term dependencies which allow us to judge how balanced the current multiples of Mastercard are.</p>
      <p>Based on the long-term relationship between the revenue TTM absolute size and the company's capitalization, Mastercard's current price is slightly overvalued:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-15740869928521507.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>According to analysts' average <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/earnings/estimates#figure_type=quarterly">expectations</a>, in Q2 '20, the company's revenue TTM will be around $18 billion, and in my model, this means that Mastercard's balanced stock price will come close to $300.</p>
      <p>But having considered the long-term relationship between Mastercard's revenue growth rate and its P/S multiple, it should be recognized that the current ratio of this multiple is in the “expensive” zone:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-15740880496924794.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Let's turn to the profit parameters.</p>
      <p>Considering the long-term relationship between the EPS absolute size and the company's capitalization, Mastercard's current price is balanced:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-15740883645902126.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>But if analysts' average expectations concerning the EPS of Mastercard in Q2 2020 come true, within the bounds of the proposed model the company's balanced stock price will approach $340. This means significant growth potential.</p>
      <p>The same conclusion is true of the P/E multiple:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-1574088905735301.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>There is one common characteristic detail: Mastercard is rather overvalued in terms of revenue and undervalued in terms of profitability. Considering that Mastercard is transforming from a "growth" company into a "profit" company, at my glance, it should be assessed mainly in terms of its profits.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Comparable Valuation</b>
      </p>
      <p>The comparable valuation based on the P/S (forward) to growth multiple has shown that Mastercard is one of the most expensive companies in the market:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-1574090017724943.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>But history teaches that it is absolutely normal for the market to evaluate Mastercard like this:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-15740900469075158.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Judging by the P/E (forward) multiple adjusted by the expected EPS annual growth rate, the stock price is now 16% higher than the balanced level. And by the way, more expensive than Visa (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V">V</a>):</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>I am more inclined to believe that Mastercard isn't cheaper than the main blue chips in Nasdaq.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Risk Parameters</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mastercard's Bearish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to drop when the market is only down) is <b>much less</b> than the Bullish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to rise when the market is only on the rise):</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-15740907617950592.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A similar situation is observed in the case of Visa:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/36835796-1574090873783713.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>This means that the bullish sentiment about Mastercard is growing.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Bottom line</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>From a technical point of view, Mastercard is growing in accordance with its natural trend. In the first half of 2020, the trend line reaches a level of $300 per share.</li>
        <li>Mastercard is rather overvalued in terms of revenue and undervalued in terms of profitability. At my glance, it should be assessed mainly in terms of its profits.</li>
        <li>Mastercard is not undervalued relative to the main blue chips in Nasdaq, but not overvalued either.</li>
        <li>Mastercard stock price is more responsive to the overall growth of the stock market than to its decline. The same is true for Visa.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So, overall now, Mastercard is a buy.</p>
