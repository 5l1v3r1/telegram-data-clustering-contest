      <h3>Harry Redknapp is questioning whether Arsenal and Manchester United have what it takes to finish in the Premier League’s top four this season.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners and the Red Devils have struggled to find consistent form in the Premier League this season and they currently find themselves off the pace in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are currently in sixth place in the table and Manchester United are a point behind them in seventh, with both clubs having only won four of their opening 12 games in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur have also been struggling to find consistent form this season and Mauricio Pochettino’s men are down in 14th place after having only won three games.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC have been in good form in recent weeks and are currently third behind Leicester City, with Manchester City in fourth spot.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs boss Redknapp has admitted that he is worried about Tottenham’s form but seems to think that both Arsenal and Manchester United will struggle to finish in the top four this season.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205776/Harry-Redknapp-Arsenal-Man-Utd-Tottenham">Daily Express</a>, Redknapp said: “Tottenham have it all on now to get in the top four this year.</p>
      <p>“The only thing now in their favour is that Arsenal look so poor.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea are doing great, they’re going to be challenging. Leicester are going to be bang in there.</p>
      <p>“But you’re looking at Arsenal — and Manchester United — and wondering if they are going to make it this year.</p>
      <p>“I can see both of those two not making the top four unless there is a big improvement.</p>
      <p>”It’s been a disappointing season so far for Spurs.</p>
      <p>“I really thought they would be close to Manchester City and Liverpool and challenging.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult. The players haven’t hit the form they did last year. I’m a big fan of the manager and hopefully they can turn it around.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal will take on Southampton this weekend, while Manchester United will travel to Sheffield United.</p>
