      <p>He went bats–t crazy.</p>
      <p>A Florida man was arrested on Friday for allegedly slugging an umpire in the face at his nephew’s little league baseball game.</p>
      <p>Alberto Ramos, 22, disagreed with one of the ump’s calls and confronted him after the game to complain, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.</p>
      <p>Things escalated, with Ramos raising his voice and the umpire asking him to leave the ballpark, according to an arrest affidavit.</p>
      <p>Instead of leaving, the hothead began raging, telling the ump that he would “kick his ass.”</p>
      <p>He then punched the ump in the face, cutting the man’s lip and breaking one of his teeth, police said.</p>
      <p>“This is completely inexcusable — assaulting a little league official while he’s officiating at a game where children are supposed to be having fun, and learning sportsmanlike behavior,” said Sheriff Grady Judd.</p>
      <p>Ramos was charged with one count of felony battery of a sports official and released on a $1,000 bond.</p>
