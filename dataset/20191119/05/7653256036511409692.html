      <p>Shares of state-owned construction company <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nbcc-india-ltd/stocks/companyid-4531.cms">NBCC</a> (India) fell in Tuesday's session after Bank of America Merryl Lynch (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BofAML">BofAML</a>) downgraded the stock and cut its target price.</p>
      <p>BofA-ML cut ratings on NBCC to ‘underperform’ from ‘buy’ earlier. It also reduced the target price to Rs 33 from Rs 47 per share.</p>
      <p>The global brokerage said NBCC’s key development projects are stranded for want of approval. It noted that nearly half of NBCC’s Rs 72,000 crore order book is related to long gestation period of 4-5 years.</p>
      <p>Tracking these negatives, BofAML cut FY21/22 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 7 per cent. It also trimmed target multiple to 15 times 2-year forward <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/EPS">EPS</a> from 20 times earlier.</p>
      <p>The shares of NBCC were trading at Rs 37, down 2.63 per cent.</p>
      <p>NBCC has recently been tasked to complete stalled projects of Amrapali by Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had about a year ago asked the state-run builder to complete 16 projects of the Amrapali group. It has completed work on two of those.</p>
      <p>The projects that the Supreme Court asked NBCC to take over at Noida and Greater Noida are expected to cost Rs 8,361 crore to complete.</p>
      <p>NBCC is also bidding for projects of Jaypee Infratech.</p>
