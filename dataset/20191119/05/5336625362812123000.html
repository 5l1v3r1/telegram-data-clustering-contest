      <p>On Monday's episode of<i> Late Night with Seth Meyers</i>, the host took a moment in the wake of Roger Stone's conviction to step back and marvel at the Everest-like mountain of evidence that has accumulated against Trump during the impeachment hearings. Which is handy, since there's so much of it that it's hard to keep straight.</p>
      <p>This included events that happened literally during the hearings, with Trump tweeting about former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch on Twitter while she was testifying. Several legal analysts have said this could fall under witness tampering, which, in case you are unsure, is a crime.</p>
      <p>"Still, if you're a <a href="https://mashable.com/video/seth-meyers-donald-trump-closer-look/">Republican</a> I get it. It's just so hard to say. Is Trump innocent, or is he guilty?" wondered Meyers. </p>
      <p>"I mean, all we have so far is a sixth Trump associate convicted of a crime, two more <a href="https://mashable.com/video/stephen-colbert-on-pompeo-giuliani-barr-and-ukraine/">indicted associates</a> saying they were on a secret mission for him, his lawyer under criminal investigation, Trump himself committing witness tampering, the whistleblower's account claiming the president 'clearly committed a criminal act,' <a href="https://mashable.com/video/stephen-colbert-on-trump-ukraine-call-transcript/">the notes from the call</a> in which Trump mentions the Bidens multiple times, the part of the call where Trump tells the Ukrainian president 'I would like you to do us a favor,' the president's chief of staff <a href="https://mashable.com/video/seth-meyers-trump-mick-mulvaney-ukraine/">literally confessing on national television</a>, Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://mashable.com/video/seth-meyers-rudy-giulianis-most-nonsensical-highlights/">going on TV</a> and bragging about what he was doing, and like a bunch of witnesses saying 'Yes, there was a quid pro quo' — I'm sorry, that's not enough to convict!"</p>
      <p>Hopefully we'll find out soon if it's enough to convict. But it is enough to make you pass out if you tried to list it all in one breath.</p>
