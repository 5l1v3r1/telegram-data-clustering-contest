      <h1>Big hands, Big Tu? Thai PM must be well-endowed: health rep</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:27:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>Thailand’s prime minister may have a short fuse but carries ample gifts below the belt, at least according to the health rep who measured his hands this morning.</p>
      <p>Many that have come across the outspoken and ever-frustrated Prayuth Chan-o-cha – the former coup-maker-turned-PM – may wonder how he gained all his quirky confidence. Perhaps the answer has been right under their – or at least the PM’s – uniforms all along.</p>

      <p>At a morning Public Health Ministry event to promote HIV awareness ahead of World AIDS Day next month, Prayuth reportedly offered his hand for a transgender NGO rep to assess his likely condom size.</p>
      <p>When she was done, she told him his girth was of worth:</p>
      <p>“Wow you have such big wrists, sir. Your condom size is 52 millimeters,” according to multiple reports which claim the PM blushed bashfully in response.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to make everyone here get measured,” he clapped back, clearly embarrassed, according to military reporter <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WassanaJournalist?__tn__=%2CdC-R-R&amp;eid=ARDP7laq6-TVFp3xC6vo53jCHB6y3CIk0SmAZyNEixbp3OFgPSydLq--fe8U0ggicVq8oSZe5L7IW3x6&amp;hc_ref=ARS-VciKFU7O1oNGlUCSvqpUDU-R1ghxw2amf7rgOFYEA41CBB02WxmU8BQ0Fy_s6VU&amp;fref=nf">Wassana Nanuam</a>.</p>
      <p>Fifty-two millimeters is slightly above the global average of about 47.6 millimeters, according to a <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-condom-size-do-i-need-906651">recent article</a>. </p>
      <p>Prayuth today also urged everyone to wear condoms “for safety and sanitary reasons.” He said the public’s embrace of jimmy hats is important to insuring the health and safety of the community. </p>
