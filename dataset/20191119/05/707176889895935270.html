      <h2>Big Four firm to dispose of property after regulator raised client perks concerns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tabby Kinder</a></address>
      <p>SoftBank is in advanced talks to take over KPMG’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d03822c0-3b60-11e5-bbd1-b37bc06f590c">contentious private club </a>in London after regulators raised concerns that the accounting firm was handing out memberships as perks to audit clients.</p>
      <p>The acquisitive Japanese technology group saw off other interested parties for the club, called Number Twenty, including WeWork, the co-working space company that SoftBank controls, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>Under the plan, SoftBank would take over the lease for the 43,000 sq ft Mayfair property early next year.</p>
      <p>KPMG put the club <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d3178da6-f8b6-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229">on the market</a> in September as part of a cost-cutting plan and stepped up efforts to offload it following concerns raised by the Financial Reporting Council, the UK audit watchdog, about hospitality being provided to audit clients.</p>
      <p>KPMG has agreed with the FRC that all of Number Twenty’s members who are also audit clients will be banned from the club from January 1. </p>
      <p>Following pressure from its US business, KPMG also recently agreed to block access to all clients that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
      <p>KPMG has in recent weeks decided to go further and abandon the membership structure entirely, according to a person briefed on the plans. It is planning to write to all of Number Twenty’s 6,000 members warning them that their membership will cease on March 1. </p>
      <p>This person said it was likely the SoftBank acquisition would “overtake” this move, but that the plans to cancel all of its memberships were progressing until the lease was officially signed over.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the lease would be acquired by SoftBank Vision Fund, the group’s venture capital arm. The fund has been looking to expand in London after announcing plans to double the number of employees worldwide to 800 in the next two years.</p>
      <p>The transaction is expected to be completed through KPMG surrendering its lease, which runs until 2030, and the acquirer being granted a new lease directly with the landlord, the Grosvenor Estate.</p>
      <p>KPMG received “strong interest” in the venue, which it rents for £4.1m a year, from <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/6a717dd1-80d1-4316-aee3-bdb081d45a5b">WeWork</a>, the co-working space of which SoftBank is an 80 per cent shareholder, according to two people familiar with the matter. Serviced office provider Regus has also viewed the property in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The club, which was established by Simon Collins, former KPMG UK chairman, in 2015, has come under fire as it allows KPMG partners to entertain clients in far more salubrious surroundings than at its Canary Wharf headquarters. Current and former clients can use the venue without a KPMG partner being present, although they must pay for the use of private meeting rooms. Tea and coffee is free, but they must be with a KPMG partner to dine or drink alcohol.</p>
      <p>It has also been criticised by some former workers for permitting an outdated drinking culture. In 2017, a corporate finance partner was brought before a disciplinary panel and left the firm after becoming heavily intoxicated at Number Twenty.</p>

      <p>Bill Michael, chairman and senior partner of KPMG UK for the past two years, has also launched an internal campaign to dispose of the club. Mr Michael, an Australian, has held “Aussie wine tasting nights” at the venue and is regularly seen on the premises. However he is “personally keen on getting rid of Number Twenty and always has been”, a person close to him said this month.</p>
      <p>KPMG is planning to rent an alternative meeting space in London’s West End after the disposal of the club. It expects to lease around 12,000 sq ft of space, according to two insiders.<br/><br/>The FRC declined to comment on Number Twenty, but said the regulator had consulted on revisions to its 2016 ethical standard. The 2016 rules required firms not to give or receive gifts or favours, including hospitality, to audit clients “unless trivial or inconsequential”.</p>
      <p>He said that revisions to the standard included an additional requirement that states: “Offering or accepting gifts, favours or hospitality to entities which may in due course become an entity relevant to an engagement may create a perception that the firm is not objective and independent.”</p>
      <p>SoftBank, KPMG and WeWork declined to comment.</p>
