      <p>Speaking here during a meeting to share findings on implementation of the Africa Mining Vision (AMV) in Tanzania, a cross-section of lawmakers was of the opinion that there is need for more transparency in the two sectors.</p>
      <p>The meeting was organized by the Policy Forum and brought together members of the parliamentary committees of Subsidiary Legislation and of Energy and Minerals.</p>
      <p>The AMV was adopted by Heads of State at the February 2009 AU summit following the October 2008 meeting of African Ministers responsible for Mineral Resources Development.</p>
      <p>It is Africa’s own response to tackling the paradox of great mineral wealth existing side by side with pervasive poverty. It advocates thinking outside the “mining box.”</p>
      <p>Accordingly it’s not just a question of improving mining sector regimes by making sure that tax revenues from mining are optimized and that the income is well spent – although that is clearly important.</p>
      <p>The legislators aired their views after a presentation made by Dr Boniphase Luhende, a lecturer at the University of Dar es Salaam School of Law, advocate and registered tax consultant, who said the mining industry in Tanzania has a lot of potential, naming them as potential for government revenue, foreign exchange and job creation.</p>
      <p>Others, he said are stimulating other sectors of the economy, improved infrastructure and transfer of technology.  He also observed that there are challenges in revenue management which include prevention of revenue leakages as well as how to strike a balance between revenue maximization and attraction of investments.</p>
      <p>He also pointed at the need for special consideration for communities around mine sites who are likely to suffer considerable disruption. “In areas where mining operations take place people complain a lot of unfairness,” he said.</p>
      <p>Luhende cited areas for further improvement as lack of legal mechanism for benefit transfer, services levy and social corporate responsibility to host communities around mine sites.</p>
      <p>The sector also lacks a special fund like that in the oil and gas sector that can be used to effectively manage windfall revenues, provide infrastructure and set aside income for use by future generations, he said.</p>
      <p>In his recommendations, he said there is need to establish the Minerals Development Fund, explaining that it would be a sovereign wealth fund to deal with savings, budget stabilization and domestic spending and investment.</p>
      <p>He called for amendment of the Mining Act to provide mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR), set specific threshold just like in the neighbouring Kenya where the law sets a minimum of one percent and penalties for non-compliance.</p>
      <p>Special Seats MP, Dr Susan Kolimba (CCM),  speaking after the presentation said there is need to review the law and figure out how to deal with shortcomings.</p>
      <p>Mbinga Urban MP Sixtus Mapunda (CCM) said there is need to have national laws that align with global systems and linked to the position, perception of Africa on natural resources, especially minerals.</p>
      <p>“I think sometimes we come up with laws and regulations that do not have the right reflection on the world market,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kilwa North MP, Vedasto Mwiru (CUF) echoed similar sentiments, saying, “probably there is a gap in national laws in relation to natural resources.”</p>
