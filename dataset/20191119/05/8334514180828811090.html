      <p>SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States has never mentioned the issues of reducing or withdrawing troops from South Korea during talks on the sharing of defense costs, Seoul’s negotiator told a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Jeong Eun-bo said that although the latest round of negotiations collapsed because of a “considerable gap” between the positions of the two sides, there had never been mention of U.S. troops.</p>
