      <h2>Music streaming service Amazon Music aims to take on rival Spotify Technology, which has nearly 140 million users for its free version</h2>

      <p>Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has introduced an ad-supported free version of its music streaming service Amazon Music, taking on rival Spotify Technology, which has nearly 140 million users for its free version.</p>
      <p>Amazon offers paid plans for its music service starting at $9.99 per month and it is also part of its prime bundle. The company launched a free version of its music service for Alexa users on Echo devices in September.</p>
      <p>Spotify, the world’s most popular music streaming service, also offers a “freemium” model that includes a free ad-supported version along with a paid ad-free version at $9.99 per month.</p>
      <p>However, Apple Inc’s Apple Music offers only paid subscription service for $9.99 per month and accounts for nearly a fifth of the paid music streaming market, according to Counterpoint Research.</p>
      <p>Amazon shares were up nearly 0.5%, while those of rival Spotify fell about 5%.</p>
