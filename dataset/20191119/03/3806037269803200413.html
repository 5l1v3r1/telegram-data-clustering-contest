      <h1>Jaden Drops Pink-Tinted Visual for "Again"</h1>
      <h2>The debut single off his sophomore effort, ‘ERYS.’</h2>

      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/jaden-smith">Jaden Smith</a> has shared a music video for the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/jaden-smith-erys-deluxe-album-stream-msftsrep"><i>ERYS</i></a> lead single, “Again.” The four-minute visual features a pink-tinged motif and begins with the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/msfts">MSFTS</a> founder in an outdoor setting, spray-painting a pink car and energetically performing on top of the hood. The clip’s pacing slows down as the second, much calmer half of the track kicks in, and introduces Jaden in a new warehouse setting complete with equally pink lighting to match the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Jaden <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/jaden-smith-again-song-stream-erys-release-date-tracklist">labelled <i>ERYS</i></a> as a “strict, hard rap album.” “I like to do it all. I like to experiment and stuff but at the end of the day, the people have spoken on what they like from me so I try to come really, really hard,” he said in a previous interview with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/zane-lowe">Zane Lowe</a> in September 2018. “I’m just tryna lead up until <i>ERYS</i>. You know, so that people can kind of start to slowly make that transition with me into the more rap world … <i>ERYS</i> is going to be just extremely hard. Just every song, back to back, high tempo, a lot of bass like just crazy.”</p>
