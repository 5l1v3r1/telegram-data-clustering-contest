      <h1>Botched DIY penis enlargement earns Iranian entry into Australia</h1>

      <p>An Iranian man seeking asylum in Australia botched his DIY penis enlargement procedure — and was granted entry to undergo pricey reconstructive surgery on taxpayer dime, according to local reports.</p>
      <p>The man in his 30s, who wasn’t publicly named, tried to grow his member by injecting himself with palm oil and fell seriously ill, <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/botched-penis-enlargement-wins-asylum-seeker-entry-to-australia/news-story/fa2dba2b505e8ff2b34b176317900285">The Australian reported</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He was transferred from an immigration detention center in Papua New Guinea to Australia last month for medical treatment that could cost up to $10,000, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>The transfer was made possible under Australia’s controversial 2019 Medevac laws, which give doctors a greater say as to which sick refugees can come into the county from offshore detention centers for medical treatment. Medical evacuations can be refused on national security grounds.</p>
      <p>In this case, the man was reportedly involved in nearly 50 behavioral incidents while being detained in Papua New Guinea since 2013, including throwing boiling water on a security guard and punching another who took away his pornography.</p>
      <p>Despite the man’s record, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton couldn’t block the transfer because of his limited power under the Medevac laws, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>Supporters of the laws argued this transfer would have occurred anyway because of the seriousness of the patient’s injuries, and blasted the leaking of the man’s medical records as unethical.</p>
