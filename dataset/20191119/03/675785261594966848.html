      <p>It was her first relationship since the suicide of Billy Yates in 2017.</p>
      <p>Friends say the Radio 2 breakfast show host didn't see a long-term future with him, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10373369/zoe-ball-dumps-boyfriend-clingy/">The Sun</a> have reported.</p>
      <p>Zoe, 48, also wanted to spend more time with her children Woody, 18, and Nelly, nine, and focus on her career.</p>
      <p>They had been dating for nearly two years but she now wants a clean break after he became 'too clingy'.</p>

      <p>“Zoe knew deep down the relationship wasn’t going anywhere," a source said.</p>
      <p>“She enjoyed her time with Michael but came to the conclusion he wasn’t a keeper, despite him believing they were getting serious.</p>
      <p>“There were certain things she grew uncomfortable with, such as him wanting to become a model and act.</p>
      <p>"Her close circle feared he was using her to enhance his own career.”</p>

      <p>Back in 2017, it was said Michael had put “a spring in her step" and that she was "smiling and enjoying life again" after meeting him in London.</p>
      <p>Billy tragically took his own life five months before following a battle with depression.</p>
      <p>"I just wanted to reach out with thoughts and an extra dollop of love to anyone going through anything at the moment, whether it be mental health problems, perhaps a loved one is poorly or maybe you're just having a right old tricky time of it," Zoe said in May, the second anniversary of his death.</p>

      <p>"Life is very tough for many reasons, when you can, if you are suffering from mental health problems try and be brave, reach out for help from your friends and family.</p>
      <p>"I can promise you they would do anything for you and it's not an easy thing to do.</p>
      <p>"Try to remember you're not alone in this funny old life, cuddle those who you love and treasure those memories."</p>
