      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Recently, Ethereum failed to surpass the $186 resistance area against the US Dollar. As a result, ETH price a fresh decline below the $182 support level. Moreover, the price broke the $180 support and settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>The recent decline was such that the price even broke the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/18/ethereum-eth-holding-crucial-support-while-bitcoin-is-declining/">main $178 support area</a>. A new monthly low was formed near $174 and the price is currently correcting higher.</p>
      <p>It is trading near the $178 pivot area. Besides, Ethereum is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $186 high to $174 low. On the upside, there are many resistances near the $180 zone (the previous support).</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $186 high to $174 low is also near the $180 level. More importantly, yesterday’s bearish trend lines are intact with resistance near $185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>An intermediate resistance is near $182 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Therefore, the price seems to be facing a strong resistance near the $180, $182 and $185 levels.</p>
      <p>A successful break above the $185 resistance is must for a decent recovery. On the downside, an initial support is near the $175 area. If the bears gain momentum below $175, there is a risk of a downside extension below the $170 support.</p>
      <p>The next key support is near the $166 level, below which the bears are likely to eye a test of the $154 and $152 support levels in the near term.</p>
