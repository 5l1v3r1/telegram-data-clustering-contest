      <h1>Kanye West Puts Wrong Emperor on 'Nebuchadnezzar' Opera Invite (UPDATE)</h1>
      <h2>Darius the Great.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:00:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:00</time> by <a rel="author">Torsten Ingvaldsen</a></address>
      <p><b>UPDATE (November 18, 2019):</b> Though <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> only recently announced his first-ever opera <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, some fans have already spotted a big mistake in his invitation artwork. Yesterday, Kanye posted the invite on <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/twitter">Twitter</a>, a shimmering gold <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nick-knight">Nick Knight</a>-designed card that features an engraving of one of the oldest Babylonian kings in the world: Darius the Great, unfortunately, not Nebuchadnezzar. In response, writer and author Joobin Bekhrad took to Twitter to educate and make clear who exactly was being depicted in the invite, providing a little history lesson: “This is the #Persian emperor Darius the Great, as depicted in a relief at Persepolis in #Iran,” he tweeted. “Nebuchadnezzar was a Babylonian king who oppressed the Jews — who were later liberated by Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire.”</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Zane-Lowe">Zane Lowe</a> interview last month, Ye mentioned how Nebuchadnezzar was a big influence for his Yeezus tour: “[God] is saying, Let me take this Nebuchadnezzar-type character — Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon, and he looked at his entire kingdom and said, ‘I did this.’ I stood on the top of the mountain talking about Yeezus, saying, ‘I’m a God.’ I had a guy dressed as Jesus!” Though the artwork on the invite is a little off, Nebuchadnezzar was, in fact, a significant Emporer. He had the longest reign in the Neo-Babylonian empire and was the most powerful monarch in the kingdom’s history.</p>
      <p><i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> will be directed by Italian performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, featuring music by Peter Colins and Infinite Song, Kanye’s Sunday Service choir. The opera is currently scheduled for November 24 at the Hollywood Bowl.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/kanye-west-dr-dre-jesus-is-king-part-2-announcement">Kanye West and Dr. Dre have announced <i>Jesus Is King Part II</i></a>.</p>
