      <p>Laurent, who hails from Amsterdam, enrolled at the university at the age of eight, and is <b>completing the three-year programme in just nine months</b>, reported <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2019/11/538887/child-genius-9-become-worlds-youngest-university-graduate">New Straits Times</a>.<br/><br/>That is, provided all goes well and he completes his final year project - <b>about a brain-connected electrical chip.</b><br/><br/>With an IQ of at least 145, he is set to become the youngest person ever to complete a university degree.</p>
      <h4>Laurent has been labelled a child genius and is often compared to Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.<br/>He can also speak four languages.</h4>
      <p>While his favorite subject is electrical engineering, Laurent told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/14/europe/university-graduate-child-genius-scli-intl/index.html">CNN</a>, "I want to study medicine, and do a PhD and make artificial organs".<br/><br/>His progress has not gone unnoticed and he is already being sought out by prestigious universities around the world.</p>

      <h4>His parents, Lydia and Alexander Simons, said they initially thought Laurent's grandparents were exaggerating when they said he had a gift, but his school teachers soon concurred</h4>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/world/europe/laurent-simons-prodigy.html">The New York Times</a>, Laurent grew up in Belgium with his grandparents while his parents worked in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>He started primary school when he was four, and went to high school at six - <b>which he swiftly completed in a span of 18 months.</b></p>

      <p>"They noticed something very special about Laurent," said Lydia, 29, who works as an office manager.</p>
      <p>It was in school that Laurent was given test after test as teachers tried to work out the extent of his talents.</p>
      <p>"They told us he is like a sponge," said Alexander, 37, who is a dentist.</p>

      <h4>Laurent's teachers at university continued to be blown away too</h4>
      <p>The university has allowed Laurent to complete his course faster than other students.</p>
      <p>"That is not unusual," said Sjoerd Hulshof, education director of the TUE bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.</p>
      <p>Hulshof said Laurent is "simply extraordinary" and praised the child prodigy.</p>
      <p>"Laurent is the fastest student we have ever had here," he said, <b>"Not only is he hyper intelligent but also a very sympathetic boy."</b></p>

      <h4>When he's not studying, Laurent says he enjoys playing with his dog Joe, playing Fortnite and Minecraft, and watching Netflix</h4>
      <p>"I'm quite lazy," he said, because he's not into sports, chess, or any musical instruments.<br/><br/>"A lot of people have stereotypes about young geniuses," his father said, but also added that he and his wife are careful to let Laurent enjoy himself.<br/><br/>"We don't want him to get too serious. He does whatever he likes," said Alexander, "We need to find a balance between being a child and his talents."</p>

      <h4>For his next chapter, Laurent said that he would like to study in the United States because "the weather is good there"</h4>
      <p>Ultimately, he sees himself developing artificial organs in the future - most notably, artificial hearts.<br/><br/>When asked why, Laurent explained that his own grandparents have heart conditions.<br/><br/>"I'd like to help people like them," he simply said.</p>
