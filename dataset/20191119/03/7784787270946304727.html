      <h1>Carlton favourite son Eddie Betts will wear his old number in 2019 and is confident the Blues can still land Jack Martin</h1>

      <h3>Eddie Betts is back at Princes Park, back in the No. 19 jumper and hoping to be joined by another indigenous star in Jack Martin by the end of the month.</h3>
      <p>The three-time All-Australian returned to Carlton last month in exchange for a future fourth-round pick, after booting 290 goals across a stunning six-year stint at Adelaide.</p>
      <p>The star small forward, who turns 33 next week, will wear the same number he wore in his first 184 games at Carlton after it was vacated by the delisted Angus Schumacher in August.</p>

      <p>More than a month on from his highly publicised homecoming, Betts now feels like he is back where he belongs.</p>
      <p>“I was actually driving my car yesterday for the first time in Melbourne (since the trade was done) – because every time I’m here I’ve got a hire car – so it’s really starting to sink in now,” Betts told reporters on Tuesday at the launch of Carlton’s new partnership with Puma.</p>
      <p>“I am (happy to be wearing No. 19 again). I played 184 games in it so I’m glad I’m back in it. I’ve still got my old jerseys.”</p>
      <p>But while Betts had his trade wish granted during the trade period, Carlton couldn’t strike a deal with Gold Coast for Martin.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old delisted himself from the Suns’ list last week to help pave his way to the Blues via the Pre-Season Draft.</p>
      <p>If the West Australian can find his way to Carlton it is understood that he will be paid more than $3 million across five years, with around $2 million to come in the first two years of a heavily front-ended contract.</p>

      <p>Betts revealed he has spoken to Martin since the trade period deadline closed on October 16 and remains hopeful the Blues can nab the prodigiously talented utility in the Pre-Season Draft.</p>
      <p>“Not as much (communication with Jack since the trade period). Before the trade (period) we spoke about if it does happen and if he does come to Carlton it will be good,” Betts said.</p>
      <p>“It is always good to have more brothers in the team – and hopefully the deal can be done.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t spoken in depth with him, but it is up to gold Coast and Carlton to work that out. Fingers crossed it can get done.”</p>
      <p>Carlton secured Betts and ruckman Marc Pittonet from Hawthorn during the trade period, before signing St Kilda midfielder Jack Newnes as a delisted free agent at the start of November.</p>
