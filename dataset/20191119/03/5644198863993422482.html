      <p>FTC Chair Joe Simons said the agency's Technology Enforcement Division, or TED, was focusing its probes of multi-sided platforms on illegal conduct and mergers that previously won antitrust approval.</p>
      <p>"We can say publicly that they're investigating Facebook because Facebook disclosed that," he told the American Bar Association 2019 Antitrust Fall Forum. "I also want to say that TED has in addition to Facebook, multiple other investigations going on into major platforms."</p>
      <p>Simons did not say which additional companies he was referencing.</p>
      <p>In addition to the FTC probes, the Justice Department and House of Representatives Judiciary Committee are looking into all four big tech companies. At the same time. Dozens of state attorneys general are also investigating Google and Facebook.</p>
