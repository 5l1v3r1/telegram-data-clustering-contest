      <p><a href="https://www.hussle.com/">Hussle</a>, a UK-based fitness marketplace, has successfully secured more than £1.3 million through its <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/companies/hussle/pitches/bj97EZ">equity crowdfunding campaign</a> on Crowdcube. The platform, which originally sought to raise £1 million, is offering 2.60% in equity at a £50 million pre-money valuation.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2009, Hussle describes itself as the UK’s largest gym network that powers the growth of thousands of gyms and health clubs across the country. The platform reported that to date it has generated almost 2.5 million gym visits from half a million people and it has partnered with almost 40% of all gyms, pools, and spas in the UK.</p>
      <blockquote>“Each month we add over 10,000 new members. That’s the equivalent of opening 5 new gyms a month. We believe that by making it more convenient to work-out…more people will do it, growing the fitness industry. We are not stopping though. In the last 6-months, we have struck exciting partnership deals with the likes of, Three, Tesco, and Premier Inn to reward &amp; incentivise their customers and this month, we are launching our Corporate Fitness Program.”</blockquote>
      <p>Hussle then noted that its mission is to create a globally trusted fitness brand that helps people make life work out. The company further explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“To do this we will continue the growth of our brand awareness, expand our Commercial and Corporate partnerships, and broaden the range of physical activities available on our platform.”</blockquote>
      <p>Funds from the Crowdcube round will be used to continue the growth and development of Hussle’s platform. It is set to close mid-December.</p>
