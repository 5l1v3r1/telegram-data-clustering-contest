      <h1>Dorrigo Preschool for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:16</time> by <a rel="author">Michele Kellett</a></address>
      <p>It's not just Christmas that comes up on the countdown list during November. For many families, this time of year signals changes ahead as planning starts for a new school year.</p>
      <p>And for the Dorrigo Preschool a new year of changes is just 10 weeks away with the first preschoolers set to start for 2020 on Thursday January 30.</p>
      <p>For many parents, the idea of preschool can be daunting with the realisation that the little person in your family has grown quickly.</p>
      <p>Forward planning at this stage of the year is important for everyone in the family as the transition to preschool is made.</p>
      <p>Preschool helps to develop and broaden the way children experience education, encouraging them to become confident, eager and enthusiastic learners who are looking forward to starting big school.</p>
      <p>During 2019 the Dorrigo Preschool has supported 41 families with placement of 48 children over the five-day week.</p>
      <p>There is no "normal" or "average" attendance at the Dorrigo Preschool - educators work with families and caregivers to place children to best suit individual needs.</p>
      <p>Preschool can be a step towards starting big school, for some it is a fun and safe place to be while Mum and Dad work, and for others it is a chance to have their own time around busy families with younger or older siblings.</p>
      <p>Enrolments for the 2020 school year are underway with educators having already placed children across the week.</p>
      <p>Programming is an important part of an educator's skill set with the learning program in preschools guided by the Early Years Learning Framework for Australia.</p>
      <p>Traditional play is important too but programmes catering for 2 year olds through to 5 year olds are well planned.</p>
      <p>The Dorrigo Preschool is a community, not-for-profit organisation run by a management committee of parent volunteers.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that everyone involved with this small preschool is proud of the wonderful memories that have been made over many years.</p>
      <p>If your family is ready for preschool in Dorrigo, please contact the Dorrigo Preschool on 6657 2078 for an enrolment pack.</p>
