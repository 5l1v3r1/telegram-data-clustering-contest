      <h1>Former Wallabies coach comes out swinging at departing Rugby Australia chairman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:11:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:11</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Former Wallabies head coach Alan Jones has called on Rugby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> chairman Cameron Clyne to go immediately and leave key tasks like finding the next national coach to a new-look board.</p>
      <p>Clyne announced on Monday he won’t stand for re-election at the completion of his difficult term in March.</p>
      <p>He said he and the board remained committed to delivering a new broadcast deal, appointing Michael Cheika’s replacement as Wallabies coach and concluding the legal matter involving Israel Folau.</p>

      <p>“Over the next four months I, along with the rest of the Board, remain committed to overseeing the delivery of a new broadcast deal, the appointment of a new Wallabies head coach, and the conclusion of the legal matter involving Israel Folau,” Clyne said.</p>
      <p>“During this time, the Board will work with the Member Union Chairs and the Nominations Committee to find a suitable replacement for my position on the Board and I will aim to make a seamless transition from the role, with a replacement in place at the AGM.</p>
      <p>“Personally, it’s been an incredible privilege to have served as Chairman and to have been part of such a professional and devoted team on the Rugby Australia Board and I look forward to continuing to support the game after my time in the role concludes.”</p>

      <p>Jones has been an outspoken critic of Clyne’s tenure, which has been shadowed by the removal of Western Force from Super Rugby, the Folau saga and disappointing results from the Wallabies.</p>
      <p>“Go now and take the board with you,” Jones, who coached Australia between 1984 and 1987, said on <i>2GB</i> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Let Australian rugby make a fresh start and no appointments should be made, coach or anybody, until a new administration is in place.</p>
      <p>“This mob are lame ducks but they’re going to lumber the next administration with whatever the lame ducks leave behind.”</p>
      <p>The Wallabies capped off a tumultuous four-year cycle last month, when they were knocked out of the World Cup by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in a 40-16 defeat at the quarter-final stage in Oita.</p>
      <p>Their elimination from the tournament spurred plenty of criticism aimed towards both axed coach Michael Cheika – who won just 10 of his final 25 matches in charge of the Wallabies, and registered a lowly win percentage of 30 percent in 2018 – and Rugby Australia.</p>
      <p>The next Wallabies head coach is expected to be announced in the coming months, with New Zealand-born <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> Warriors boss Dave Rennie considered the favourite for the job.</p>
