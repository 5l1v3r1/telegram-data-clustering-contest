      <h1>‘Marjaavaan’ box office collection Day 4: The Sidharth Malhotra-Tara Sutaria starrer holds strong on first Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:24:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:24</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Milap Zaveri's '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Marjaavaan">Marjaavaan</a>', starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sidharth-Malhotra">Sidharth Malhotra</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Riteish-Deshmukh">Riteish Deshmukh</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tara-Sutaria">Tara Sutaria</a> in lead roles, has held up well on its first Monday at the box office. According to reports on BoxofficeIndia.com, the film earned an estimated Rs 4.25 crore nett on Day 4, thus recording an estimated total of Rs 28 crore nett thus far.</p>
      <p>The film that opened to an impressive Rs 7 crore at the box-office, went on to earn another Rs 7 crore on Saturday and saw one of the best growth in collections on Sunday, with a collection of Rs 9.75 crore.</p>
      <p>The drop in collections from Friday is only said to be about 40%, which has prompted trade experts to already declare the film as a success. If it manages to maintain its hold at the ticket windows, reports claim that the film could just be declared as one of the hit films of the year. Since its release on Friday, the film has managed to draw in the masses across mass circuits and even metro multiplexes.</p>
      <p>Milap cashed in on the popular '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ek-Villain">Ek Villain</a>' duo Riteish and Sidharth in 'Marjaavaan' with the former playing the role of a villain and the latter playing the small-town <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/action-hero">action hero</a>.</p>
      <p>Sidharth said in a recent statement, "'Ek Villain' and 'Brothers' introduced me as an action hero. I did not cater to this audience and today I am happy that they have given this kind of response to 'Marjaavaan'."</p>
      <p>The movie that hit theatres on November 15, 2019, has been facing stiff competition from the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayushmann-Khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a> starrer ‘Bala’, but going by these numbers, it is putting up a good fight.</p>
