      <p>Since being deported from the United States, Maria Butina has received several job offers in Russia, including one with the human rights commission.</p>
      <p>Butina, 31, pleaded guilty last year to one count of conspiring to act as a foreign agent for Russia. She infiltrated the National Rifle Association and influenced Republican and conservative activists to promote Russian interests in the 2016 presidential election. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison, but was released last month after serving 15 months. She was deported on Oct. 26.</p>
      <p>When she arrived back in Russia, Butina was greeted by cheering supporters. She made her first public appearance since then on Monday, alongside the country's human rights commissioner, Tatyana Moskalkova. Moskalkova invited Butina to "work in our group defending compatriots abroad," explaining: "I'm sure together we'll be able to do a lot of good for people who've ended up in tough situations abroad." Butina did not say if she'll take the job or if she'll accept another offer to work in Russia's lower house of parliament, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-butina/russia-offers-job-to-maria-butina-woman-convicted-by-us-of-being-an-agent-idUSKBN1XS26M"><i>Reuters</i> reports.</a></p>
      <p>Also on Monday, Butina's former boyfriend, conservative political operative Paul Erickson, <a href="https://www.ksfy.com/content/news/South-Dakota-man-linked-to-Butina-pleads-in-fraud-case-565123022.html">pleaded guilty</a> to one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering. Authorities say the South Dakota businessman promised dozens of clients returns of up to 150 percent, but in reality stole $2.3 million from them. He was accused of using this money on personal expenses for Butina.</p>
