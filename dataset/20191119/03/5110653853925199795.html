      <h1>Donald Trump's campaign considers buying a Super Bowl ad, report says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:55:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:55</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bernstein</a></address>
      <p>President Donald Trump's increased involvement in U.S. sporting events could culminate in a record-breaking advertisement buy for the Super Bowl, according to <a href="https://t.co/j3LH3pL2Xm?amp=1">a report from the Sports Business Journal</a>.</p>
      <p>The prospective deal for the FoxTV broadcast, which would be orchestrated by his 2020 re-electioncampaign, could cost in the neighborhood of $5.6 million for 30 seconds of airtime. That would likely<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-campaign-ads/#candidate=donald-trump">exceed the cost of any other campaign ad he has purchased</a> so far, though he reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/betsy_klein/status/1189720957415575552?s=20">paid seven figures for a World Series ad last month</a>.</p>
      <p>A deal has not yet been completedand negotiations arestill ongoing, according to the SBJ report.</p>
      <p>"The president’s team has agreed on the broad terms for buying an ad," a source told SBJ. "No contract is signed yet."</p>

      <p>This fall, Trump attended a World Series game in D.C. <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/donald-trump-booed-at-nationals-park-during-world-series-fans-chant-lock-him-up/12q2vw81zo0li1h0xilnps1jzy">to a chorus of boos</a>, and an Alabama-LSU college football contest<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVSNOxehfALut52NbkfRBaA">at which he received a warmer reception</a>.
