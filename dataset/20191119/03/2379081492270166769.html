      <h1>Corn rebounds from 2-month low as U.S. harvest pace lags</h1>

      <p>SINGAPORE — Chicago corn futures ticked higher on Tuesday with the market</p>
      <p>rising from a two-month low touched in the previous session, while soybeans recovered from their</p>
      <p>lowest in nearly seven weeks as a slow pace of U.S. harvest underpinned prices.</p>
      <p>Gains in both markets were limited by renewed doubts over a U.S.-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>The most-active corn contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) was up 0.2% at</p>
      <p>$3.68-1/2 a bushel, as of 0259 GMT, after dropping to its lowest since Sept. 18 at $3.67-1/2 a</p>
      <p>bushel on Monday.</p>
      <p>Soybeans were up 0.2% at $9.12-1/4 a bushel. In the previous session, soybean futures</p>
      <p>dropped to an Oct. 4 low of $9.10 a bushel.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the U.S. corn harvest was 76% complete, while</p>
      <p>the soybean harvest was pegged at 91%. The five-year average pace of corn harvest stands at 92% and</p>
      <p>soybeans at 95%.</p>
      <p>Doubts over a U.S.-China trade deal kept a lid on prices.</p>
      <p>A CNBC report cited that the mood in Beijing was pessimistic about a trade deal due to U.S.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump’s reluctance to roll back tariffs, dampening sentiment among global</p>
      <p>investors.</p>
      <p>“Most participants have given up watching that deal as it is on and then off again,” said Ole</p>
      <p>Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney.</p>
      <p>“Prices will be range-bound until we can find some real new news.”</p>
      <p>Chinese state media had said Washington and Beijing held “constructive talks” on trade in a</p>
      <p>high-level phone call on Saturday that included Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. trade representative</p>
      <p>Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p>
      <p>CBOT wheat was down 0.1% at $5.06-3/4 a bushel, having closed up 0.9% on Monday.</p>
      <p>Strategie Grains has lowered its estimate of the soft wheat area for next year’s harvest in the</p>
      <p>European Union after heavy rain disrupted field work in western EU countries.</p>
      <p>In a monthly report, the French analyst firm pegged the EU’s soft wheat area for 2020 at 23.7</p>
      <p>million hectares, down about 200,000 hectares from its initial outlook in October and now below an</p>
      <p>estimated 23.8 million hectares harvested this year.</p>
      <p>Commodity funds were net sellers of CBOT corn, soybean and soymeal futures contracts on Monday,</p>
      <p>and net buyers of wheat and soyoil futures, traders said.</p>
