      <h1>ESPN Insider Has New Details On Tua Tagovailoa’s Recovery Timetable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:44:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa underwent successful surgery on his dislocated right hip earlier today. Now, we have some information about the expected timeline for his recovery.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s Laura Rutledge, Tagovailoa will be on a partial weight-bearing plan for the next six weeks. He will be rehabbing daily in Tuscaloosa during that time.</p>
      <p>After three months, the star quarterback will be able to increase his activity and by springtime, he should be throwing again.</p>
      <p>Rutledge’s report comes after <a href="https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2019/11/tua-tagovailoa-being-flown-to-houston-for-hip-surgery.html">an earlier report from AL.com</a> saying the estimated recovery time for Tagovailoa is 6-to-8 months.</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa was injured late in the second quarter of Alabama’s 38-7 win over Mississippi State on Saturday. He landed awkwardly on his hip after being tackled while attempting a pass rolling to his left.</p>
      <p>Alabama was up 35-7 at the time of the injury. Nick Saban said after the game that it was supposed to be Tagovailoa’s last series of the afternoon.</p>
      <p>We’ll see over the next few months how Tagovailoa’s recovery unfolds and what happens to his NFL Draft stock, should he declare for the 2020 draft as expected.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Mac Jones will lead Alabama in the final two games of the regular season.</p>
