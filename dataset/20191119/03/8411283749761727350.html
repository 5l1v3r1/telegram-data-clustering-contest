      <h1>Micro LED looks promising, but faces challenges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:10:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:10</time> by <a rel="author">Siu Han, Taipei; Adam Hwang, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Micro LED seems promising for being use in display devices, but mass transfer yield rates during and production costs remain problems in commercializing the technology.</p>
      <p>Samsung Electronics showcased a 75-inch micro LED TV at CES 2019 in January, with the size of micro LED chips 93% smaller than that of those used in The Wall, a 146-inch modular micro LED TV it exhibited at CES 2018.</p>
      <p>LG Electronics showcased a large-size micro LED display based on TFT backplanes at InfoComm 2019 in mid-June and plans to offer above 100-inch models in 2-3 years.</p>
      <p>China-based TV vendor Konka recently unveiled a CNY8.88 million (US$1.27 million) Smart Wall, a 236-inch 8K micro LED TV enabled by high-precision mass transfer of nearly 100 million micro LED chips onto a backplane.</p>
      <p>Taiwan-based AU Optronics (AUO), with micro LED chips supplied by PlayNitride, has used in-house-developed mass transfer technology to produce 12.1-inch micro LED panels for use in automotive dashboards and central information displays. Trial production for such micro LED panels is likely to start two years from now, and volume production to kick off at least five years from now, AUO said.</p>
      <p>PlayNitride cooperated with China-based panel maker Tianma Micro-electronics to exhibit a 7.56-inch transparent micro LED display at SID Display Week 2019 in mid-May, with PlayNitride providing in-house-developed mass transfer technology and in-house-produced micro LED chips and Tianma providing LTPS TFT backplanes.</p>
      <p>China-based panel maker BOE Technology and US-based Rohinni in January 2019 established a joint venture specifically for developing above 32-inch mini LED and micro LED displays.</p>
      <p>Micro LED developer LuxVue Technology, after being acquired by Apple in May 2014, has not yet shown progress in commercializing the technology. However, Apple will launch mini LED-backlit 10- to 12-inch iPad Pro and 15- to 17-inch MacBook Pro in 2020, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>There are about 300 micro LED R&amp;D units around the world at present, three times as many as the number two years ago. These R&amp;D units differ in their approaches: some has developed mass transfer technology for micro LED chips of below 10 microns but it may not be suitable for micro LED chips of above 20 microns; some use PCB backplanes, but their technology may not be applied to glass ones; and some others' can accomodate all types of backplanes, which nevertheless results in slower mass transfer process.</p>
      <p>Commercialization of micro LED technology faces big challenges concerning raising mass transfer yield rates and reducing chip size. It is relatively easy to reduce the size of micro LED chips from 100 microns to 50 or even 30, but technologically difficult to below 10 microns.</p>
      <p>Production cost is a also a major challenge. As a result, a micro LED 4K TV would be much more expensive than an LCD equivalent currently.</p>
      <p>These challenges are deterring many vendors from launching micro LED products and they would rather wait until the technology becomes mature for commercial application.</p>
      <p>Micro LED technology is likely to be initially applied to above 100-inch displays (including TVs) or smart wearable devices, while application to 5- to 6-inch smartphone screens is relatively infeasible for the time being due to competition from OLED panels.</p>
