      <h1>The yield curve is no longer signaling a recession</h1>

      <p>The yield curve is no longer inverted!</p>
      <p>Hear ye! Hear ye! Short-term interest rates are no longer higher than long-term rates.</p>
      <p>If I had one of those long, straight trumpets used in medieval times, I’d blow it right now. The yield curve is back to normal with higher rates on long maturity government securities than on shorter ones.</p>
      <p>Just so you know, interest rates haven’t been out of whack for some time now. But as late as mid-October the yields on three-month US Treasury bills were higher than the rate on the government’s 10-year notes.</p>
      <p>And when that was the case the media couldn’t blow that horn loud enough because it is considered in the financial world as a sign that the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/15/economy-teetering-on-edge-of-recession-as-rates-fall-analysts-warn/">economy was going into a recession</a>.</p>
      <p>Now that the yield curve has righted itself, there’s no horn blowing. Not a peep. That’s why you probably didn’t know of this latest development.</p>
      <p>Now let me throw you a little curveball from a trebuchet — that’s a Middle Ages’ tool for hurling an object — in keeping with this column’s antiquities theme.</p>
      <p>Now that the yield curve isn’t signaling a recession, some other indicators are.</p>
      <p>Late last week the Atlanta Federal Reserve, for instance, said the economy in the current quarter is growing at just an 0.3 percent annual rate. That’s barely higher than a recessionary level.</p>
      <p>Growth slowed a lot, mainly because a key economic indicator, industrial production, sucked in October. (I believe the term “sucked” was also first used in Medieval times but I can’t be sure.)</p>
      <p>But industrial production might also be a curveball from a trebuchet because those numbers were hit hard when California utilities shut off power last month.</p>
      <p>But take heart, Trump-haters. Other indicators, like the amount of freight being handled by truckers, is also sending out bad vibes.</p>
      <p>If the economy goes into a recession — and I’m saying “if” — President Trump will say it isn’t his fault because the Democrats have been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/house-investigating-if-trump-lied-to-mueller-during-russia-probe/">fiddling with impeachment</a> and playing other games that are distracting everyone from the business at hand.</p>
