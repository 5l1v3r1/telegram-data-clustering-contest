      <h1>Ian Williams wins $100K Giller prize for 'Reproduction'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:02:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:02</time> by <a rel="author">Adina Bresge, The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>TORONTO -- Ian Williams has won the $100,000 Scotiabank Giller Prize for his <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/canadian-poet-ian-williams-says-first-novel-reproduction-is-like-a-child-1.4263436">debut novel "Reproduction."</a></p>
      <p>Williams received the honour at a glittering Toronto gala Monday night.</p>
      <p>"Reproduction" traces the ties that bind a cross-cultural chosen family in Williams' hometown of Brampton, Ont.</p>
      <p>The tale begins when a sober-minded teenager from a small island nation and the listless heir to a German family fortune meet in the hospital room where their mothers lay dying.</p>
      <p>From there, Williams unspools a narrative so entangled it strains against novelistic convention.</p>
      <p>Jury members praised the Vancouver-based writer for his "masterful unfolding of unexpected connections and collisions between and across lives otherwise separated by race, class, gender and geography."</p>
      <p>"Reproduction," published by Random House Canada, was a finalist for this year's Amazon First Novel Award.</p>
      <p>Williams' short-fiction collection, "Not Anyone's Anything" won the Danuta Gleed Literary Award in 2012, and he's been a rising star in poetry circles. His 2013 collection, "Personals," was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize and the Robert Kroetsch Poetry Book Award.</p>
      <p>Williams was the 2014-2015 writer-in-residence in the University of Calgary's distinguished writers programme, and has held numerous other fellowships and residencies.</p>
      <p>He is currently a Griffin Poetry Prize trustee and associate professor of poetry in University of British Columbia's creative writing program.</p>
      <p>Williams beat out titles by David Bezmozgis, Michael Crummey, Megan Gail Coles, Alix Ohlin and Steven Price.</p>
      <p>Before the Giller winner was announced, a who's who of Canada's cultural scene walked the Giller red carpet at the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto.</p>
      <p>Singer-songwriter and actress Jann Arden hosted the night's festivities, which were broadcast on CBC.</p>
      <p>The six finalists were chosen from 117 submissions by a jury consisting of Canadian writers Donna Bailey Nurse, Randy Boyagoda and Jose Teodoro, Scottish-Sierra Leonean author Aminatta Forna and Bosnian-American author Aleksandar (Sasha) Hemon.</p>
      <p>The Giller awards $100,000 annually to the author of the best Canadian novel or short story collection published in English, and $10,000 to each of the finalists.</p>
      <p>Last year's winner was Esi Edugyan for "Washington Black."</p>
