      <p>Taifa Stars had an impressive start to their campaign in the qualifiers, notching 2-1 win over Equatorial Guinea at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam weekend.</p>
      <p>Striker Simon Msuva and midfielder Salum Abubakar netted for Taifa Stars in the clash, forward Pedro Obiang scored what turned out to be a consolation for Equatorial Guinea’s consolation.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars definitely need to be at their best against Libya, as the latter will be keen on getting their campaign in the qualifiers back on track.</p>
      <p>Libya experienced frustrating start to their campaign, conceding a 4-1 loss to Tunisia, who are widely expected to sail through to the 2021 AFCON finals.</p>
      <p>Wahbi Khazri and Saif-Eddine Khaoui netted two goals apiece for Tunisia, the semi-finalists in the last AFCON finals which was hosted by Egypt.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars are currently placed second in the Group J of the qualifiers behind the group favourites, Tunisia, whereas Equatorial Guinea and Libya, who lost their respective opening matches, are placed third and fourth.</p>
      <p>Much as both Taifa Stars and Tunisia have collected three points, the North Africa giants boast of better goal aggregate, thanks to their impressive victory over Libya.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars will, today, miss the services of utility player Erasto Nyoni that picked an injury in the last weekend clash with Equatorial Guinea.</p>
      <p>Nyoni played in the defensive midfield in the first half of the clash, whereas Kelvin Yondani partnered Bakari Mwamnyeto in the central defense role,</p>
      <p>With Ndayiragije seeking to bolster Stars’ striking force, Nyoni was, in the second half, deployed as central defender after right fullback, Hassan Ramadhan, had been rested for striker Ditram Nchimbi.</p>
      <p>Yondani was, for that matter, deployed as right fullback in the second half in a tactical substitution which ultimately paid off.<br/>Juma Kaseja, Stars’ keeper, requested soccer followers in Tanzania to pray for the team in an effort to see to it the side comes out with good results.</p>
      <p>Kaseja promised Taifa Stars’ players will play their hearts out against Libya with a view to notching victory and boost their pursuit of progression to the AFCON finals.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars will then host Tunisia at the National Stadium on September 8 next year.</p>
