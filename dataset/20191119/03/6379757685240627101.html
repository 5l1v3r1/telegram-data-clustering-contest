      <p>The seminar, which involved Olympic committees’ secretary generals, was attended by all 54 ANOCA member states.<br/>Tanzania Olympic Committee (TOC) vice-president, Henry Tandau, said they have agreed to work together for the benefit of sports in the region.</p>
      <p>He described the seminar as extremely fruitful.</p>
      <p>“It was a very good seminar, there were many things which we agreed to focus on but the main one was working together, sharing information and expertise so that Africa can develop in sports,” he said.</p>
      <p>Participants at the seminar also discussed the past performance of African athletes at the Olympic Games and how prepared they are for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</p>
      <p>The seminar was opened during the weekend, with Zanzibar’s Minister for Information and Tourism, Mahmoud Thabit Kombo, gracing the opening ceremony.</p>
      <p>At the opening Kombo hailed all 54 ANOCA member states for attending the seminar, saying that means that Zanzibar and Mainland Tanzania are good and safe place which attracts all people.</p>
      <p>He said it is an honour for him to be the guest of honour at the seminar which, among other things, aimed at discussing the continent’s preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>Kombo also informed the gathering that Zanzibar is suitable for beach sports like soccer, volleyball and other sporting activities.</p>
