      <p>Patrick Frazee was found guilty of first-degree murder in the case of his fiancée’s death, nearly a year after she went missing from her Colorado home with their infant daughter.</p>
      <p>Frazee, 33, was sentenced to life without parole for murdering Kelsey Berreth, 29, plus an additional 156 years. He was also found guilty for two counts of murder, three counts of solicitation to commit murder and tampering with a deceased human body, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/patrick-frazee-found-guilty-first-degree-murder-death-fianc-e-n1084856">NBC News</a> reported. The trial began on November 1.</p>
      <p>Berreth was last seen in public last Thanksgiving while grocery shopping with her daughter, Kaylee. She was reported missing by her mother, Cheryl Berreth, on Dec. 2, 2018. Berreth’s body has not been found.</p>
      <p>Frazee’s girlfriend, Krystal Lee Kenney, pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence in the case earlier this year. She testified against Frazee in compliance with a plea deal.</p>

      <p>She claimed that Frazee ordered her to clean Berreth’s apartment on November 24, where “she found blood covering the living room floor, splattered on the walls, on the carpet in other rooms and behind a couch,” NBC News reported. Kenney also testified that Frazee killed Berreth with a baseball bat and then burned her body.</p>
      <p>Frazee asked Kenney to kill Berreth three times, Colorado Bureau of Investigation Agent <a href="https://www.insider.com/investigators-say-patrick-frazee-beat-kelsey-berreth-to-death-2019-2">Gregg Slater testified in February</a>, adding that he was angry each time she didn’t execute one of his plans, including using a poisoned drink from Starbucks.</p>
      <p>“I think, based on my observations of Patrick Frazee over the last year, that there’s a potential that Patrick Frazee indicates and is consistent with a sociopath,” Beth Reid, one of the prosecutors on the case, told NBC News after the verdict. “That’s a person who has basically an inability to feel empathy with other people.”</p>
