      <h1>Another idiotic privatisation takes flight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:30:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/author/leith/" target="_blank">Unconventional Economist</a></address>
      <p>In desperate search of quick cash to fund the state’s ballooning population, the Victorian Government is looking to <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/dataroom/morgan-stanley-gets-vicroads-sale-scoping-job/news-story/a0b9ed5afefbe8e142dc7bc011178eda">sell-off the state’s monopoly motor registry agency</a>, VicRoads, to private interests:</p>
      <blockquote>Investment bank Morgan Stanley has won the role to embark on a scoping study for the Victorian Government to determine whether to sell its motor registry unit…<br/><br/>Should the unit, which is called VicRoads, be placed up for sale, it is expected to be worth about $2 billion.<br/><br/>Also working with Morgan Stanley is KPMG.<br/><br/>VicRoads handles all of the state’s motor vehicle registrations, which helps to fund critical roading infrastructure.<br/><br/>Expected to bid for the asset, should it come up for sale, is Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.<br/><br/>Australian funds, including IFM, would also be logical contenders.<br/><br/>The government is likely to make a decision about a sale of VicRoads ahead of the state budget around May or June.</blockquote>
      <p>Victoria’s motor vehicle registry is an essential government service and a profitable natural monopoly. It’s sale will inevitably result in end-users being gouged by the new monopoly owners, whereas the State Government will lose a reliable income stream.</p>
      <p>The Victorian Government has clearly hit peak stupid in its lust for privatisation. Voters deserve better.</p>
