      <h1>Neoen to expand world's largest lithium ion battery in Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:09:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:09</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>French power producer Neoen SA said on Tuesday it will expand its Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, the world’s largest lithium ion battery, by 50% to help improve stability of the state’s power grid.</p>
      <p>The A$71 million ($48 million) project will enlarge the 100 megawatt battery, which is owned and operated by Neoen, and was built two years ago in conjunction with Tesla Inc.</p>
      <p>The move comes as energy storage becomes increasingly essential to managing power supply in Australia as coal-fired plants are shut down and alternatives are needed to back up intermittent solar and wind power.</p>
      <p>The Hornsdale project stemmed from a promise by Tesla’s Elon Musk to help keep the lights on in South Australia following a string of blackouts by building a battery within 100 days or giving it to the state for free.</p>
      <p>South Australian Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said the expansion was designed to reduce spot price volatility and protect the grid from network disturbances.</p>
      <p>The project will receive A$15 million from the South Australian government, up to A$50 million ($34 million) in cheap loans through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and A$8 million from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).</p>
      <p>“Large-scale batteries are playing an important role in providing short term, large-scale energy storage to help firm and balance the grid,” ARENA CEO Darren Miller said in a statement.
