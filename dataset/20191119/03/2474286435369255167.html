      <p>A number of Moree locals are now equipped with new skills to pursue employment opportunities after successfully completing a certificate II in construction at TAFE NSW Moree.</p>
      <p>Thirteen students attended TAFE NSW Moree on a full-time basis for seven weeks to learn new skills such as how to work safely at heights, how to safely use construction tools and equipment, concreting, levelling procedures, and how to read and interpret plans.</p>
      <p>"Considering the Australian government's jobs outlook website is predicting a further 38,200 new builder's labourers positions to become available across the country until 2023, it was the ideal time for these students to get the hands-on skills they need to pursue employment opportunities in the construction industry," TAFE NSW construction teacher Colin Walsh said.</p>

      <p>"The students have really enjoyed this course.</p>
      <p>"They have applied themselves well and it's been really inspiring to see them build their confidence as their skill set increased.</p>
      <p>"The highlight of the course for the students was constructing a new pergola at TAFE NSW Moree that all students can now use and enjoy.</p>
      <p>"The students were very proud of their work and benefited from being able to see how the practical skills and experience that they were learning at TAFE NSW can be put to good use."</p>
      <p>All students successfully graduated from the course which highlights a successful collaboration between Moree SHAE Academy, careers network and TAFE NSW Moree.</p>
      <p>The students received ongoing support from the Moree SHAE Academy through their SHAEping up program.</p>
      <p>"Both the SHAE Academy staff and the Moree community were very proud of the boys' commitment while completing the course and gaining skills that will shape their careers and future ambitions," Moree SHAE Academy CEO Chris Binge said.</p>
