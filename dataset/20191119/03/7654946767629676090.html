      <p>A West Virginia man admitted to authorities that he married one of his two daughters after helping both of them kill another man and dump him in a shallow grave, a report said Monday.</p>
      <p>Larry Paul McClure, 55, said in a letter to state investigators that he and his daughters — 31-year-old Amanda Michelle Naylor McClure and 32-year-old Anna Marie Choudhry — plotted the murder of John McGuire, who was dating Amanda, <a href="https://www.bdtonline.com/news/sordid-details-emerge-suspect-confesses-father-daughter-marry-after-murder/article_94f64c4c-09b9-11ea-9c2e-13c0546c2456.html">the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reported</a>.</p>
      <p>A West Virginia State Police officer testified in a recent court hearing that the trio hit McGuire in the head with a bottle of wine, tied him up and injected him with two vials of meth, according to the report.</p>
      <p>They then strangled him to death and buried him in a shallow grave on the property of a home they were staying at in the Skygusty section of the state.</p>
      <p>In his admission letter, McClure wrote the murder was his daughter Amanda’s idea.</p>
      <p>“I cannot tell you why Amanda wanted John McGuire dead,” Larry McClure wrote, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“I am asking for this to be over and not waisting [sic] the taxpayers money and hurting the family members on both sides of this. John McGuires family and my family,” he added. </p>
      <p>Police allege Amanda and her father then traveled to Virginia and married each other at the United Methodist Church.</p>
      <p>Larry McClure, a registered sex offender, and Amanda then had sex with each other at the house where they murdered McGuire, the report said.</p>
      <p>McClure and his daughters have all been charged in the grisly murder.</p>
