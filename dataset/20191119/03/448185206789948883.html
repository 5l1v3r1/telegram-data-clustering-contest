      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI: </b>The All Assam Primary Schools Midday Meal Cook and Helpers’ Association has dared Education Minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya to disclose the names of the teachers involved in corrupt practices in running the midday meal scheme.</p>
      <p>Bhattacharya recently accused headmasters of certain primary schools of being involved in corrupt practices while operating the midday meal schemes. The minister said the government had gathered enough evidence, both still and video images, to prove the allegation.</p>
      <p>The allegation of the Education minister has come at a time when the State is witnessing widespread protests and agitations against the government’s move to engage NGOs in cooking and distribution of mid-day meal in schools.</p>
      <p>General Secretary of All Assam Primary Schools Mid-day Meal Cook and Helpers’ Association Zahanara Begum said the midday meal scheme has been efficiently carried out by the teachers, cooks and helpers across the State since 2005.</p>
      <p>“If a section of teachers were involved in corrupt practices in running the midday meal scheme, why were they not punished? If some teachers had misused goods and funds meant for the midday meals, how could the minister justify handing over the scheme to the NGOs. Those involved in cooking midday meals for several years cannot be kicked out from the job by involving NGOs. We dare the Education minister to disclose the names of erring teachers and punish them,” Begum said.</p>
      <p>On other hand an evaluation conducted by the Union Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry has found that over 70 per cent children who availed mid-day meals in government schools in Assam could concentrate better on studies after meals.  While 87 per cent children said they relished the taste of the food.</p>
      <p>According to the evaluation 92 per cent children going to government schools are benefitting from mid-day meal while 80 per cent of the parents surveyed agreed that the scheme has improved enrolment as well as attendance of children.</p>
