      <p>“The SFW hopes to build on this foundation enthusiastically…not only did we show the world that the depth of design talent in Tanzania and Africa is truly amazing, we have now created and support the platform by promoting it globally.”</p>
      <p>Hassanali also disclosed that Italian designer, Marta Zampolini, will attend the SFW and a workshop and talk on how to venture into global market.</p>
      <p>“There is African proverb ‘if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far go together’, this year’s aim is to reach out to the public to emphasize and promote talents within the fashion industry and beyond,” he said.</p>
      <p>He further said the goal of developing the African fashion space remains at the forefront of what they are aiming to do.</p>
      <p>He added through the platform and its wide media exposure, the customers in Tanzania, Africa and diaspora at large will see there is an alternative to the imported brands.</p>
      <p>Hassanali also disclosed that they have this year added a new category, namely Designer of the Year, which is for designers from upcountry.</p>

      <p>Italy’s Ambassador to Tanzania, Roberto Mengoni, said he is delighted with Swahili Fashion Week and asked all fashion designers who will showcase their products at the event to make use of the platform for promotion of their brands.</p>
      <p>“Designing is a big business, I’m asking all those who will showcase their brands at the Swahili Fashion Week to make use of the platform to make connections with others for the benefit of both,” he said.</p>
