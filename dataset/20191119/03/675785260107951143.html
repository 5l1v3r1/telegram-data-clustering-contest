      <h1>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson compared to Tottenham striker Harry Kane</h1>
      <h2>Although the two play in different positions they are also the only two genuinely world-class players in the England team according to Micah Richards</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:25:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:25</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester City and Aston Villa defender Micah Richards claimed that Jordan Henderson is the only player in the England squad who plays at a similar level to that of Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>Kane's strike during the 4-0 win over Kosovo meant he scored in all eight of England's Euro 2020 qualifying matches, and although Henderson did not take part in the most recent round of games, he has won 55 caps for his country and is highly-rated by manager Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <p>Despite England having a wealth of attacking talent, Richards insisted Henderson was the only other player on Kane's wavelength.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/5live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> Richards said: "Harry Kane is world-class. In midfield, there's no other world, world-class midfielders.</p>
      <p>"Henderson, you'd argue Henderson's world-class, because of what he's done and consistency and whatnot.</p>
      <p>"He’s won a European Cup, he’s been consistent over the last three or four years. Yeah, it really is (hard to write off a Champions League-winning captain).</p>
      <p>"You know what, I’m going to go with that statement, I’m going to say Henderson is world-class and a lot of the work that he does goes unnoticed because he’s not getting 10 assists a season or scoring 10 goals a season.</p>

      <p>"I was referring to on the field but off the field as well. I’ve played with Henderson and he’s just an honest guy who would run through brick walls for you, he’s willing to improve, he wants the team to be at its best."</p>
      <p>Kane should next be in action when his struggling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> side take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, while Henderson's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are in action later on against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> as they look to maintain their eight point lead at the top of the Premier League.</p>
