      <p>Thieves have stolen two television sets from a home of South Africa’s police chief Gen Khehla Sitole, a police spokesman has said.</p>
      <p>“Actually it was not a break-in. However, two television sets were stolen,” Brigadier Vish Naudi was quoted by South Africa’s privately owned IOL news site as saying.</p>
      <p>“The national commissioner’s house is currently under construction and, therefore, we are exploring certain possibilities. We believe that this was purely opportunistic.”</p>

      <p>Gen Sitole was apparently in the parliamentary capital, Cape Town, when the thieves struck at his home in eastern Mpumalanga province, IOL reported.</p>
      <p>The police boss has become a victim of crime at a time when he is under intense pressure to bring down high crime levels in South Africa.</p>
