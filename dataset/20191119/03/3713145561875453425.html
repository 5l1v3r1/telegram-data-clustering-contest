      <h1>Cybersecurity startup CyCognito raises $18M in Series A funding</h1>

      <p>CyCognito, a cybersecurity platform that aims to give visibility into a company’s security weak spots, has raised $18 million in its Series A round of funding.</p>
      <p>Lightspeed Partners led the fundraise, which included a personal investment from Lightspeed venture partner and former Microsoft chairperson John Thompson, and additional participation from Sorenson Ventures.</p>
      <p>CyCognito says its software-as-a-service platform can “autonomously discover, enumerate, and prioritize each organization’s security risks based upon a global analysis of all external attack surfaces.” In other words, it measures a company’s entire attack surface, looking for holes and flaws, which could be exploited by malicious actors. It does this by maintaining tens of thousands of bots which spiders out across the internet, looking for internet-connected and exposed devices. With that database of digital assets, the company looks for issues that could be used for attacks.</p>
      <p>The startup says its platform already in use by “dozens” of corporate customers, across healthcare, hospitality and financial verticals.</p>
      <p>Now with $18 million in the bank, CyCognito says it plans to expand its engineering and sales teams to reach more enterprise clients.</p>
      <p>Two years since the company’s founding, its leadership page consisted of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191118194343/https://www.cycognito.com/leadership">only men</a>.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Rob Gurzeev said the company was “actively seeking to hire more women and non-binary persons into senior roles” and “actively encourages growth of diversity in its workforce.”</p>
      <p>After TechCrunch raised lack of diversity with CyCognito, the company quickly changed its leadership page to include one woman.</p>
