      <h1>Customers claim Ulta’s Beautyfest was full of empty promises</h1>

      <p>Ulta Beauty’s recent ploy to boost foot traffic amid sagging sales is backfiring on social media.</p>
      <p>The retailer told eager consumers last week that its 1,200 stores would open one hour earlier than usual — at 9 a.m. — on Saturday and Sunday to celebrate its Beautyfest promotion. The chain promised free giveaways, coupons, $100 gift cards and other perks.</p>
      <p>But customers quickly flooded social media with complaints that some stores failed to open their doors on time and that they waited in freezing temperatures for chintzy freebies.</p>
      <p>“@ultabeauty I was here an hour early and they aren’t open!” one upstate New York consumer wrote.</p>
      <p>“#ultabeautyfest was the Fyre Fest but for makeup lovers,” tweeted another disgruntled customer.</p>
      <p>Customers complained that they waited in line only to be handed a measly $5 coupon, or discounts and goodie bags with unexpected fine print, including approval of an Ulta credit card.</p>
      <p>Another tweet: “That was disappointing this morning @ultabeauty. Show up early to get a cheap plastic bag and a coupon that I can’t use because I’m not a first time customer. #ultabeautyfest #Sweepstakes.”</p>
      <p>Excitement over the promotion was strong to start, but as word about the disappointing giveaways spread on social media, “traffic trailed off,” according to retail consultant Gabriella Santaniello, whose A-Line firm dispatched retail checkers to the stores.</p>
      <p>Ulta on Monday apologized to its customers, saying it “missed the mark.”</p>
      <p>“While most of our guests were thrilled, we realize that some were not and we apologize to those who thought we missed the mark,” an Ulta spokesperson said in a statement. “We’ve listened to our guest feedback and learned from what they have shared with us.”</p>
