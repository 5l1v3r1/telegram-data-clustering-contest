      <p>A street dog that was shot by a disgruntled senior citizen in Jayanagar last week has made a partial recovery. But activists who had it admitted into veterinary care are facing a hefty hospital bill, which they are struggling to pay.</p>
      <p>In a video shared by the We Save All (WSA), animal compassion group, the animal can be seen walking around, being led by a leash, outside the Jeeva Pet Hospital, where it was being treated for multiple bullet wounds.</p>
      <p>The female dog, since christened ‘Bullet Rani’, had been brought to the hospital on November 11 after she was found by residents in Jayanagar 5th Block in a state of distress and bleeding from two bullet holes.</p>
      <p>Praveen, a member of WSA, backed by several residents and other animals had rushed the animal to the hospital in JP Nagar for immediate treatment.</p>
      <p>A retired Nimhans doctor, Syama Sundar (83), was subsequently taken into custody and later told police that he had shot the animal with an airgun because it was defecating outside his property. He was released on bail after paying a Rs 50 fine, as the crime is a bailable offence.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the animal’s hospital bills amount to Rs 15,370.</p>
      <p>MLA Soumya Reddy, who visited the animal after it was admitted to the hospital, told DH that she was pressing to have Sundar pay for the dog’s hospital costs. “He must pay. There must be a punishment for his actions,” she said.</p>
      <p>Praveen of the WSA specified that the dog had been shot twice. “Neither bullet can be removed because one is lodged close to the spine and the other is in the rib cage. Operating near the spine could risk paralysing the animal,” he said.</p>
      <p>As it is, one leg is already paralysed, and WSA said it will take the responsibility of housing Bullet Rani at its shelter in Sumanahalli. “Nobody has come forward to adopt her,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Even fewer have contributed towards her treatment,” he added.</p>
      <p>Reddy asked that people attempt to sterilise stray animals in their neighbourhoods, to cut down on the street dog population and prevent these kinds of incidents from happening in the future.</p>
