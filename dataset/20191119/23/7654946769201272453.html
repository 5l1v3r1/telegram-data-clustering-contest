      <p>New York is a dangerous place to live. Drug lords rule the streets of Chelsea. The High Line is a cesspit of crime where bullets fly as often as gelato is scooped. Expect to be caught in enemy crossfire at any Williamsburg Italian restaurant. Out-of-towners will draw these and other bogus conclusions after watching “21 Bridges”, one of the worst depictions of our city ever filmed.</p>
      <p>Cinema has had fun warping NYC many times before. The dystopian “Escape from New York” turned it into a futuristic maximum security prison, and artful mafia movies have amplified the dark underbelly of organized crime.</p>
      <p>But what’s so enraging about “21 Bridges” is that this substandard thriller seizes on a polarizing group — the police — in an obvious ploy to make a relevant political point about cop culture. Any remote chance it has of doing so is undone by an empty-headed, poorly considered and impossible-to-believe plot twist that reveals the cops to be the villains. All but one of them. It made me rip my hair out, and I now look like one of the film’s stars, J.K. Simmons.</p>
      <p>Director Brian Kirk’s movie begins with seven cops being brutally murdered during a drug bust at a wine bar after hours in a hip section of present-day Brooklyn. Lol, sure. Three hundred kilos of cocaine are sitting in the basement right next to the Sancerre, and the cop killers grab the coke. That scene introduces the film’s primary crutch to create tension: pointing a gun at someone’s head.</p>
      <p>A specialist, Detective Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman), is brought to the crime scene by an NYPD Captain (Simmons). Davis is the son of a gunned-down police officer, and he’s dedicated his life to justice and the NYPD. His colleagues call him “a cop who kills cop killers.” His mission here is to track down the perps — and he shuts down the entire island of Manhattan (and its bridges) in the process.</p>
      <p>That’s when a chase sequence happens that will have you doubling over with laughter. One of the killers is running through the Meatpacking District, automatic weapon in tow, and ducks into a labyrinthine slaughterhouse. Lucky him — there’s almost none left! He ends up dodging bullets beneath the picturesque High Line, in the shadow of multimillion-dollar apartments.</p>
      <p>Boseman, for his part, brings warmth to an outwardly chilly role and continues his usual high-caliber acting. But the only way he could save this script is with a pencil.</p>
      <p>The final shot of “21 Bridges” is the skyline of Manhattan against a blaring, atmospheric score, seeming to indict the city for its systemic corruption and mismanagement. That would be fine if this was called “De Blasio: The Motion Picture.”</p>
