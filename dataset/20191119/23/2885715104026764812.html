      <p>Five men were arrested from North West Delhi’s Bawana for allegedly running a manufacturing unit in Pooth Khurd village, where they prepared cumin with low-quality raw material.</p>
      <p>Police said the accused— Harinandan, Kamran, Ganga Prasad, Harish and Pawan — are from UP’s Shahjahanpur. “We received information about the racket and shared the information with senior officers and FSSAI officials,” said a senior officer.</p>
      <p>A raid was conducted and it was found that fake cumin was being manufactured using grass, stone powder and sheera in the premises. A case was registered and the raw material, along with the fake cumin, was seized.</p>
      <p>“The accused said they learnt to manufacture fake cumin at their hometown. The process involves mixing a special type of grass with sheera. Stone powder is then added to the mixture and made to resemble real cumin,” an officer said. Police said they sold the product for Rs 20 per kg, as against Rs 400 per kg for genuine cumin.</p>
