      <p>Rennie, who had also been approached about the vacant New Zealand post, succeeds <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-cheika/"><b>Michael Cheika</b></a>, who resigned after his side's World Cup quarter-final defeat to England in Japan in October.</p>
      <p>The PA news agency understands Glasgow have already identified Rennie's successor and an announcement will be made soon, although the New Zealander will see out the current season with the Warriors and depart in July 2020.</p>

      <p>The 55-year-old had previously stated that he would see out his contract, which expires in June. Rennie joined Glasgow in 2017 after five years with Super Rugby club Chiefs in his home country.</p>
      <p>Rugby Australia chief executive Raelene Castle said: "This is a massive coup for Australian rugby, Dave Rennie was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we're thrilled to have<br/>secured his services.</p>
      <p>"Dave's coaching philosophy focuses equally on football and team culture, the key pillars to building sustainable success in any team. He has a proven track record in the Northern<br/>and Southern Hemisphere."</p>

      <p>"He enhanced the strong, positive culture at Scotstoun and pushed the team to achieve significant results, playing some outstanding rugby on the way.</p>
