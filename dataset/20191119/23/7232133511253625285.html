      <h1>Echo Bubble Narrative Grows Stronger as Bitcoin Struggles to Find Support</h1>

      <p>It has been a crazy past few weeks for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency’s price incurring an explosive rally that sent it surging from lows of $7,300 to highs of $10,600 before this momentum faltered and BTC began a slow grind down to its current price levels.</p>
      <p>One prominent analyst is now noting that Bitcoin’s inability to stabilize above $10,000 following this rally may bolster the bearish “echo bubble” narrative that many analysts have been entertaining over the past couple of months.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Finds Continued Support at $8,000 </h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/09/24/analysts-rule-out-bitcoin-drop-to-4000-despite-bearish-signs-heres-why/">Bitcoin</a> is trading down over 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $8,190, which marks a slight climb from its daily lows of $8,000, which is where the crypto has been able to find continual support at over the past day.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin has been slowly grinding lower over the past several days and weeks, finding multiple support levels before trading sideways and ultimately breaking down to set lower lows.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear as to whether or not this bearish pattern will continue to persist in the near-term as BTC consolidates around $8,000, but one analyst does believe that the crypto will soon post a large upwards movement.</p>
      <p>HornHairs, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, explaining that the demand for BTC around its current price range, as well as a few other factors, have led him to believe that this current price level will mark a mid-term bottom.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC: I’ve stuck to LTF scalps since the pump but am now looking to hop into a longer time frame swing trade here on the buy side. Bullish MS break on the weekly (higher high), price retracing back to the fib OTE, yearly pivot, weekly demand &amp; daily bullish breaker,” he explained while referencing the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <h3>Will Technical Weakness Confirm Bearish BTC Echo Bubble Narrative?</h3>
      <p>Mark Dow, a popular economist and hedge fund manager, recently spoke about Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/bitcoin-open-interest-may-act-as-rocket-fuel-for-explosive-bull-movement/">price action</a> in a tweet, explaining that “truly strong” assets don’t immediately retrace after movements like the one seen in late-October, and that its swift retrace from its highs of over $10,000 could confirm the bearish echo bubble narrative.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’ll see if 200dma matters to #bitcoin. But truly strong assets don’t give back moves like the one up thru 10k, esp when they start from so far below ATHs. Thesis of echo bubble unwind, w occasional upside spasms &amp; progressively weaker FOMO, just got a lot stronger,” he noted.</blockquote>

      <p>If BTC is unable to hold above its near-term support and fully retracts the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/17/bull-run-intact-bitcoin-price-indicator-long/">gains</a> that were incurred during the recent rally, it could confirm significant underlying weakness that opens the gates to even further losses.</p>
