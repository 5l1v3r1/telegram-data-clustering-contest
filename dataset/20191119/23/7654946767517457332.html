      <h1>Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford is ‘sick’ of getting death treats</h1>

      <p>The death threats and hatred were becoming too much for Sean Clifford to look at. He no longer is.</p>
      <p>The Penn State quarterback told reporters Tuesday he has turned off his social media accounts in response to the vulgar messages he received over the team’s first loss of the season to Minnesota on Nov. 9. Clifford, who is having a strong season, usually turns off his accounts closer to games, but has completely shut them down since throwing three interceptions in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/penn-state-upset-by-minnesota-as-playoff-hopes-take-major-hit/">the 31-26 defeat to the Golden Gophers </a>— which put a hit on the Nittany Lions’ chances of making the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of sad to say, but you know how fans sometimes get … it gets a little crazy,” Clifford <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28116819/penn-state-sean-clifford-deletes-social-media-death-threats">told reporters</a>. “I was kind of, I guess, sick and tired of getting death threats, and some pretty explicit and pretty tough-to-read messages.”</p>
      <p>Penn State coach James Franklin said he’s been there to support Clifford and has praised the fans who have remained positive. Nevertheless he understands the pitfalls that can come with social media.</p>

      <p>“We’re 9-1, we’re ranked in the top 10, I think. We’ve had a pretty good year based on most people’s standards, and sometimes you go on social media and you wouldn’t feel that way,” Franklin said.</p>
      <p>Clifford, a sophomore who has thrown for 2,450 yards and 22 touchdowns to six interceptions this season, has been able to stay upbeat about the season in spite of dealing death threats and unruly fans. Penn State visits No. 2 Ohio State next week and a win would go a long way toward securing a spot in the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>“You learn how to deal with certain things and how certain people are just gonna react because, you know, it’s a very passionate game with a lot of passionate people,” Clifford said. “Our fans are definitely one of if not the most passionate in the country. I just try to stay away from it. I appreciate all of the positive people that are around, but there’s also people that try to tear you down.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Franklin has had to deal with one of his players getting death threats at Penn State. Current Jets kicker Sam Ficken received them in 2012 after missing four field goals and a PAT in a loss to Virginia before rebounding for a big season the following year.</p>
      <p>“You hate to see it, but the sad thing [is] it’s a part of our reality of our society right now,” Franklin said. “You see that in a lot of areas; the last thing I want to do is get into other things besides football right now, but you see a lot of things that are behaviors in our society now that we accept that I don’t know why we’re accepting.”</p>
