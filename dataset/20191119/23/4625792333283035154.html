      <h1>Poll: Buttigieg takes 10-point lead in New Hampshire</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:17:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:17</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>A new poll has Pete Buttigieg opening up a 10-point lead in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary race.</p>
      <p>The Saint Anselm College Survey Center <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/saint-anselm-poll-buttigieg-surges-to-10-percentage-point-lead-over-biden-warren-in-nh/29849189#">poll</a> of likely Democratic voters, which was released Tuesday, had the South Bend mayor with 25% support while Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren both received 15% support. The poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters is a 15-point jump for Buttigieg since the September poll, while Biden's support dropped 9% and Warren's support dropped 10%.</p>
      <p>Neil Levesque, who directed the poll, said Buttigieg was helped by a high net favorability rating. Seventy-six percent of likely New Hampshire Democratic voters said they have a favorable view of the mayor, while only 11% said they have an unfavorable view. In contrast, nearly a third of likely Democratic voters have an unfavorable view of Warren. New Hampshire "is still in a great deal of flux," Levensque said.</p>
      <p>The news comes as <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-status-pete-buttigieg-tops-gold-standard-iowa-poll">several recent polls</a> in Iowa, the first primary state, showed Buttigieg leading the field. As the mayor reemerges as a top-tier candidate, Buttigieg has been involved in new controversies.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Buttigieg was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/it-was-alarming-black-leaders-claim-buttigieg-misled-voters-about-douglass-plan-for-black-america">slammed for an endorsement announcement</a> of black leaders supporting his Douglass Plan that was meant to shore up his support among black voters. He has also received criticism this week for a 2017 photo in which he <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/this-guy-buttigieg-takes-flak-for-2017-picture-at-holocaust-memorial">posed at a Holocaust Memorial</a> in Berlin.</p>

      <p>Additionally, some pundits have <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/%20/hes-done-pete-buttigieg-slammed-for-complimenting-the-tea-party-in-resurfaced-2010-video">declared the end of his candidacy</a> after video from 2010 resurfaced showing him praising the Tea Party.</p>
