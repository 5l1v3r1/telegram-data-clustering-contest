      <h1>Kickstarter’s new budget tool helps keep projects accountable for your money</h1>

      <p>We’ve all seen it happen: a crowdfunding project makes a ton of money and gets rave press only to get delayed by months, years, or never ship at all. Today Kickstarter is launching a ‘Project Budget’ tool that hopes to minimize these occurrences by letting creators share a project’s budget publicly.</p>
      <p>While Kickstarter launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/product-upgrade-a-calculator-for-funding-goals">Funding Calculator</a> tool earlier this year, this was a private feature for creators. The Project Budget uses this data and displays it publicly on a product’s campaign page, forcing a degree of accountability and reminding creators of expenses they might not have fully considered.</p>

      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20971432/kickstarter-project-budget-funding-calculator-campaign-backers">The Verge</a></i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20971432/kickstarter-project-budget-funding-calculator-campaign-backers">,</a><i> </i>projects that share a budget are more likely to be featured on Kickstarter’s homepage. They’ll also display a badge that will tell backers its creators are trying to be more transparent. For backers, it should provide some added peace of mind and help them hold creators accountable.</p>
      <p>Of course, this all depends on project creators actually being honest; Kickstarter isn’t verifying the budgets and expenses themselves, but it’s a step in the right direction. Kickstarter says it will compare estimated costs with final costs in order to provide more accurate budget predictions in new projects.</p>
      <p>The feature will roll out first to the Design and Technology categories, but budget templates will be available for other categories “in the near future.”</p>
