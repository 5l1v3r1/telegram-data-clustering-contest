        <b>Aaron Ramsey’s Euro 2020 qualifying campaign had been ruined by injury until his brace against Hungary sealed a place at the finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gareth Bale ribbed Aaron Ramsey over his fitness record after the Juventus man fired Wales to the Euro 2020 finals with a brace in the 2-0 win over Hungary.</p>
      <p>Needing victory to progress as automatic qualifiers from Group E at Hungary’s expense, Ramsey marked his first start of an injury-ruined campaign with a headed opener from Bale’s 15th-minute cross.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal favourite was on the mark again early in the second half as Wales made it back-to-back European Championship qualifications.</p>
      <p>“It’s about time he contributed, isn’t it?” Bale told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“Obviously he’s a world-class player, you like to have him back. He showed again what a great player he is, scoring the goals that helped us through.”</p>

      <p>Wales were the surprise package of Euro 2016, with Ramsey and Bale to the fore as they reached the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Now both senior members in an increasingly youthful squad under Ryan Giggs, Ramsey was desperate to secure another outing on the biggest stage.</p>
      <p>“We had the best time of our lives in France,” he told Sky Sports. “We missed out on the [2018] World Cup, so it was a big effort.</p>
      <p>“I missed a lot of this campaign but it’s all worthwhile. Chipping in with a couple of goals is amazing.</p>
      <p>“It means everything. We inspired a nation last time out. We wanted to do it again.</p>
      <p>“There are some players here who haven’t experienced this. We wanted to give them a taste of it as well. We’ve got a great squad, a lot of great players coming through.”</p>
      <p>Speaking alongside Bale, Ramsey added: “There’s still some life left in our legs yet. We’re enjoying it. We’ll enjoy tonight now as well.”</p>
