      <p>Some Indonesian supporters were stuck inside the stadium after the match ended as they wanted to avoid confrontation with Malaysian supporters outside the stadium.</p>
      <p>Cheras police chief Assistant Commissioner Mohamed Mokhsein Mohamed Zon this morning said 27 Malaysian fans and 14 Indonesians fans were detained during the incident.</p>
      <p>“They were later released after the documentation process was completed,” he said, adding that investigations are still ongoing.</p>
      <p>Based on video clips making the rounds on social media, the first flare which emitted red smoke was flung after Malaysia took the lead in the 29th minute.</p>

      <p>Last month, Indonesia’s national football association was fined US$45,000 (RM187,000) by Fifa over crowd trouble during a World Cup qualifier against Malaysia in September.</p>
      <p>Malaysian fans were threatened and pelted with projectiles during the visiting side’s 3-2 win.</p>
      <p>Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, who was at the Gelora Bung Karno stadium then, said several Indonesian football fans had tried to barge into the area reserved for Malaysian fans.</p>
