      <h1>Arsenal: Per Mertesacker’s Mikel Arteta comments not the smartest</h1>
      <h2>Per Mertesacker has said that he would ‘love to work with’ Mikel Arteta again. They are not the smartest comments from Arsenal’s Academy Director.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:59:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/andrewdowdeswell/" target="_blank">Andrew Dowdeswell</a></address>
      <p>The pressure on <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> head coach <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=unai+emery">Unai Emery</a> is only increasing. The statistics speak for themselves. Two points from the last four matches, only 24 points from the last 19 games, a decreasing attacking presence or team identity, with a negative goal difference and just a six-point gap back to Aston Villa in 17th. It is not going very well.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This pressure has only intensified on Tuesday night when north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur made the ruthless decision that many Arsenal fans have been wanting their team to make by firing their manager, Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Whatever you may think of the wisdom of the Pochettino decision, that he has been fired before Emery is somewhat of a shock, and it only thrusts expectation onto the Gunners decision-makers to swing the axe on a largely viewed incumbent manager.</p>
      <p>And so, amidst all this growing controversy and pressure, it is important for the club to be unified, whether that be in committing to a new era under a new head coach or in supporting Emery. But that is not what Academy Director<a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=per+mertesacker"> Per Mertesacker</a> is doing at present.</p>
      <p>When interviewing with <i>FourFourTwo</i> this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/MrArsenicTM/status/1196653001945038853">Mertesacker discussed his ideal starting XI with players that he previously played with</a>. He named <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=mikel+arteta">Mikel Arteta</a> as one of the central midfielders. He then mentioned that he would like to worth with his former club captain, someone who has been heavily linked with the head coaching role at the Emirates:</p>

      <blockquote>“I was his vice-captain at Arsenal and he trusted me. I was by his side during team meetings and we had a great bond. I’d love to work with him again – a top guy.”</blockquote>
      <p>Now, I do not want to completely pile on Mertesacker here. He is conducting a public interview with a magazine and is simply providing his opinion on a former teammate. And what he says is likely not wrong. They may well have had a close connection with one another. He might well want to work with Arteta again. But at the present time, just don’t say these type of things.</p>
      <p>Similar to players ‘liking’ social media posts that criticise teammates or call for Emery to be sacked, Mertesacker stating that he would ‘love to work with’ Arteta again is just not smart.</p>
      <p>Is it the end of the world? No. But it is yet another stupid mistake from a high-profile figure at the club? Yes, it is. It just isn’t very smart, and that is turning into a bit of a theme.</p>
