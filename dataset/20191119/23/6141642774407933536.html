      <p>Here are the best and worst moments for both leaders during the hour-long head-to-head debate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jeremy Corbyn</b>

      <p>The applause was loud when Mr Corbyn criticised the Tories for putting the NHS under “incredible pressure” and called for an end to privatisation and for proper funding.</p>
      <p>He also evoked a powerful image when he discussed his friend, the campaigner Jayne Rae, who died from breast cancer days after describing being left in “extreme pain” in hospital without treatment for hours.</p>
      <p>Perhaps his wittiest response was when the PM accused him of wanting to form a “chaotic coalition” with the SNP and, in a reference to the Conservative-Lib Dem government, Mr Corbyn replied: “We’ve witnessed nine years of chaotic coalition already.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Worst</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was under pressure over his stance on Brexit and whether there would be a further referendum on Scottish independence if Labour came to power.</p>
      <p>When pressed by the PM, Mr Corbyn could not rule out another IndyRef if he became prime minister and could only say it would not come in the “early years”.</p>
      <p>And, after declining to say whether he would campaign for any new Brexit deal he might broker with Brussels, Mr Corbyn was met with laughter when he said: “I’ve made the position clear.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Boris Johnson</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Conservative leader repeatedly asked Mr Corbyn whether he would campaign for Leave or Remain in his proposed second referendum.</p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn repeatedly sidestepped the question, playing into Mr Johnson’s hand as he sought to suggest that Labour’s policy on Brexit is unclear.</p>
      <p>Conservative cabinet ministers seized on the moment, with Michael Gove saying: “There was open laughter at Jeremy Corbyn’s failure to answer the questions on Brexit. People want Brexit done, they want an end to the paralysis.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Worst</b>
      </p>
      <p>Questions about the Prime Minister’s private life – and his use of disputed figures – have prompted questions about whether he is a trustworthy character.</p>
      <p>Audience members laughed when Mr Johnson answered a question about trust and personal integrity during the debate – and there were further chuckles when he said the truth matters in the election.</p>
      <p>He brought yet more laughter when he asked voters instead to “look at what I’ve said I’m going to do as a politician and look at what I’ve delivered”.</p>
