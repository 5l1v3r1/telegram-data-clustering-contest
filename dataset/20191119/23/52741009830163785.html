      <p>OTTAWA — A man acquitted on two counts of sexual assault earlier this year is facing a fresh set of charges involving three new alleged victims.</p>
      <p>Ottawa police say they arrested 34-year-old Paul Batchelor on Tuesday and charged him with three counts of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>They say the alleged offences took place between 2009 and 2016 and involve three different women the suspect met either online or at "evening events" in the city.</p>
      <p>Ottawa lawyer Oliver Abergel represented Batchelor in court on the new charges and says his client is being held in custody. </p>
      <p>Abergel says Batchelor was acquitted of two counts of sexual assault in Ontario Superior Court in June.</p>
      <p>Ottawa police are urging anyone with information on Batchelor to come forward.</p>
