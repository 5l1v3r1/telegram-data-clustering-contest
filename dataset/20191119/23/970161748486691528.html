      <p>The former campmate appeared on the Extra Camp sofa with Alison Hammond as they discussed ‘Jane Gate’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/who-is-adele-roberts-and-what-has-the-im-a-celebrity-star-done-since-leaving-big-brother-11167584/">Adele Roberts</a> had the first clash of the series over the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">iconic Jane McDonald photo, which Adele brought in as her luxury item.</a></p>
      <p>Alison started by telling Emily Atack and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joel-dommett/">Joel Dommett</a> that taking a photo of Jane into the jungle was ‘random’.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a bit awks,’ Alison began.</p>
      <p>‘It was random and he was just stating a fact maybe she is embarrassed or maybe she has been caught out a little bit.’</p>

      <p>John Barrowman, who is not one to hold back accused Adele of bringing the photo in ‘to get a vote from a certain community’.</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘She has been caught out a little bit because she used the word prejudice, and he was just a young man asking a question.</p>
      <p>‘If you brought a picture of Jane McDonald on you should probably know the songs she sang.</p>
      <p>‘She probably brought it on to get a vote from a certain community and it’s all backfired on her a little bit, I think you are seeing her true colours right now.’</p>

      <p>Talking together in the main camp, Kate Garraway and Roman are talking about the picture, which Adele brought in as her ‘luxury item’.</p>
      <p>While Adele’s girlfriend Kate Holderness has since cleared up why she brought in the framed photo, the campmates where nonethewiser.</p>
      <p>But Kate saw the plus side, as Kate asked: ‘Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?’</p>
      <p>Admitting she didn’t know any, Adele said: ‘I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.’</p>

      <p>Adele then feels cornered by Myles and Roman who laugh at her, with Roman declared: ‘No one knows what she does.’</p>
      <p>As Kate backed up Adele and Jane, Roman put her on the spot, and asked her: ‘She’s a legend is she? Name a song?’</p>
