      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/99/lsu-tigers">LSU</a> remains atop this week's edition of the College Football Playoff rankings, with <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama</a> staying at No. 5 in the wake of quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa">Tua Tagovailoa</a>'s season-ending hip injury.</p>
      <p>The rest of the top four remains the same: No. 2 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State</a>, No. 3 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/228/clemson-tigers">Clemson</a> and No. 4 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/61/georgia-bulldogs">Georgia</a>.</p>
      <p>Committee chair Rob Mullens told ESPN that Tagovailoa's injury did not impact Alabama's ranking, as the Crimson Tide still cruised to a 38-7 victory over <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/344/mississippi-state-bulldogs">Mississippi State</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Our job is to evaluate the games through Week 12 and obviously we're aware of the injury to the quarterback late in the second quarter of last week's game," Mullens said. "But Alabama continued on to a convincing win ... so it didn't impact the rankings this week."</p>
      <p>A group of one-loss Power 5 teams rounds out the top 10, starting with <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2483/oregon-ducks">Oregon</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/254/utah-utes">Utah</a> standing pat at No. 6 and No. 7, respectively.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/201/oklahoma-sooners">Oklahoma</a>, fresh off its comeback victory on the road against <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/239/baylor-bears">Baylor</a>, moved up one spot to No. 9. The previously undefeated Bears, meanwhile, fell one spot to No. 14.</p>
      <p>No. 10 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/135/minnesota-golden-gophers">Minnesota</a>, the other unbeaten team to lose on Saturday, fell two spots but still edged out No. 11 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/57/florida-gators">Florida</a> to remain in the top 10.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/213/penn-state-nittany-lions">Penn State</a>, which lost to the Golden Gophers two weeks ago, finds itself ahead of them in the rankings No. 8.</p>
      <p>The Big Ten once again features the most teams in the rankings with six; No. 12 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/275/wisconsin-badgers">Wisconsin</a>, No. 13 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/130/michigan-wolverines">Michigan</a> and No. 17 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2294/iowa-hawkeyes">Iowa</a> all moved up in this week's rankings.</p>
      <p>Following a close loss to Georgia, No. 15 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2/auburn-tigers">Auburn</a> dropped just three spots from last week. <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/87/notre-dame-fighting-irish">Notre Dame</a> remains at No. 16, despite handily beating previously ranked <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2426/navy-midshipmen">Navy</a>.</p>
      <p>No. 18 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/235/memphis-tigers">Memphis</a> leads all Group of 5 teams, jumping No. 19 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2132/cincinnati-bearcats">Cincinnati</a>, while No. 20 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/68/boise-state-broncos">Boise State</a> and No. 24 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2026/appalachian-state-mountaineers">Appalachian State</a> both moved up a spot.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2306/kansas-state-wildcats">Kansas State</a>, Navy and <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/251/texas-longhorns">Texas</a> all fell out of the rankings following losses on Saturday, which made room for newcomers No. 22 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/66/iowa-state-cyclones">Iowa State</a> (which knocked off Texas), No. 23 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/30">USC</a> and No. 25 <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/college-football/team/_/id/2567/smu-mustangs">SMU</a>.</p>
