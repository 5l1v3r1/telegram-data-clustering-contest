      <h1>Kano Pillars hand coaches three-match ultimatum</h1>

      <p>The management of Kano Pillars has given its technical crew headed by Ibrahim Musa Jugunu a three-match ultimatum to “improve on the team’s performance or face sanction”.</p>
      <p>This follows the Aiteo Cup holders 0-1 loss to Lobi Stars on Sunday and the Matchday 1 fixture, which ended 0-0 against Rivers United a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by the media officer of the four-time champion, Rilwanu Idris Malikawa, he said the management under the leadership of Alhaji Surajo Yahaya would not fold its arms and allowed things to continue this way.</p>
      <p>The statement further said the three-match ultimatum given is to help in improving the team’s performance and would take effect from the next NPFL game.</p>
      <p>The Sai Masu Gidas have found themselves 17th on the Nigeria Professional Football League table with just a point from two matches both played at home.</p>
