      <p>After missing for 17 years, a piece of literary history has been found. As <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/art-detective-tracks-down-oscar-wildes-stolen-friendship-ring-180973576/">Smithsonian.com</a> reports, a gold ring that writer <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59484/25-oscar-wildes-wittiest-quotes">Oscar Wilde</a> gifted to his friend is back home at Oxford's Magdalen College, following its theft from the school in 2002.</p>
      <p>The friendship ring's history at Oxford dates back to 1876, when Wilde was studying there with his friends Reginald Harding and William Ward. Ward was planning to drop out of school to travel, and Wilde and Harding wanted to give him something to remember them by. The gift—an 18-karat gold ring shaped like a belt buckle—is engraved with the initials of each member of the trio and a Greek inscription that translates to “Gift of love, to one who wishes love."</p>
      <p>The ring wound up back at Oxford, where it was kept with a collection of Oscar Wilde artifacts at the university's Magdalen College until <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/may/08/highereducation.news">2002</a>. That year, a former college custodian named Eamonn Andrews broke into the building through a skylight and got away with the friendship ring and three unrelated medals. The thief was eventually apprehended thanks to DNA he left at the scene, but by then it was too late: He had already pawned the jewelry for less than $200. The gold band is estimated to be worth around $70,000 today.</p>
      <p>Hopes for the keepsake's recovery deflated after that. Investigators assumed that it had been melted down by scrap dealers and declined to pursue the case any further. That seemed like the end of the story until 2015, when art detective Arthur Brand (known as the "Indiana Jones of the Art World") heard whispers of a black market ring that fit a similar description to the missing item. <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/stolen-oscar-wilde-ring-1707597">Brand theorizes</a> that after originally being stolen from Oxford, the ring wound up in one of the safe-deposit boxes that got looted during the infamous Hatton Garden heist of 2015. After the heist, it hit the market again and landed on his radar.</p>
      <p>With help from <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191116-oscar-wilde-s-stolen-ring-found-by-dutch-art-detective">William Veres</a>—a London antiques dealer—and George Crump—a man with connections to the British underground crime scene—Brand determined that the ring had recently switched hands. The new owner was shocked to hear that the unusual Victorian ring once belonged to Wilde and was fully cooperative in returning it to the college.</p>
      <p>The ring will resume its official spot in Magdalen College's collection at a small ceremony on December 4.</p>
