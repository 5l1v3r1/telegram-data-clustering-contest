      <h1>Former College Football Coach: “Alabama’s Run Is Over”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:23:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Alabama has been a member of the College Football Playoff since its inception. The Crimson Tide have been on a historic run, earning the reputation of college football’s most intimidating team.</p>
      <p>Could Alabama’s run of playoff appearances be over this season though? One former college football coach thinks so. Current CBS Sports analyst Rick Neuheisel is weary of the Crimson Tide’s chances to make the College Football Playoff following QB Tua Tagovailoa’s season-ending injury.</p>
      <blockquote>“Alabama’s run, I think, is officially over,” Neuheisel said, via <a href="https://twitter.com/JimmyHyams/status/1196499664394166272?s=20">Jimmy Hyams of WNML Sports Radio</a>. “I think Alabama is all but cooked [without Tagovailoa]. I think they’re out.”</blockquote>

      <p>It’s a bit premature to say “Alabama’s run … is officially over.” A whole lot of football is left to be played. Alabama needs some help to get into the College Football Playoff. But given the Crimson Tide’s track record of success, the playoff committee might give them the edge over a one-loss Pac-12 or Big 12 champion.</p>
      <p>Tuesday night’s CFP rankings will offer a much clearer picture of what the committee thinks of Alabama without Tagovailoa. And now, it’ll be up to backup QB Mac Jones to not only lead Alabama to victories, but to do so convincingly.</p>
      <p>If he’s unable to do so, the Crimson Tide are in trouble.</p>
