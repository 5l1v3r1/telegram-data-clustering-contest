      <p>A 24-year-old woman who was dragged by a van for several blocks in Vancouver last month suffering both life-threatening and life-altering injuries, is now awake and on the road to recovery.</p>
      <p>Desiree Evancio has undergone multiple surgeries to reconstruct her face after she walked between a van and a trailer it was towing before she was dragged for several blocks in downtown Vancouver on Oct. 12.</p>
      <p>Police <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/woman-dragged/cp90550161">said she walked between the van and trailer as it was stopped at a traffic light.</a></p>
      <p>“She is very awake and I believe will be fully awake moving forward until her next operation,” Desiree Evancio's sister Ashley Danh wrote on a GoFundMe page.</p>
      <p>"She is now aware of all of her injuries. I think she understands the extent of everything and how she was close to dying."</p>
      <p>Evancio will need a prosthetic eye and nose, and surgery has been done to restore her upper lip, Dahl wrote, noting that her sister is now able to contribute to the medical decisions.</p>
      <p>“She was heavily sedated for just under two weeks so her face could heal from the surgery they performed. She's been quite awake for a number of days now, and has been able to write to communicate with family and friends and the nurses which is so great.”</p>
      <p>Dahl says her sister can't remember the accident.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://ca.gofundme.com/f/hope-for-desiree">The GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $236,000 so far.</a>
