      <p>The celebrations are likely to continue long into the night as <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-qualify-for-euro-2020-17276617">Wales secured their place at Euro 2020.</a></p>
      <p>Two goals from Aaron Ramsey fired Ryan Giggs' side to next summer's tournament and Cardiff went off.</p>
      <p>There were wild scenes out on the pitch as players embraced each other and fans in the stands did the same.</p>

      <p>It was an emotional night at the Cardiff City Stadium and Gareth Bale got a little over-exciting, swearing in a live TV interview, forcing the broadcaster to apologise.</p>
      <p>And the celebrations spilled into the Wales dressing room as manager Giggs was soaked and players chanted Wayne Hennessey's name.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper made crucial double-save during the match as Wales closed the game out.</p>
      <p>Broadcaster Sky Sports captured the moments in the dressing room and tweeted the footage above.</p>
      <p>Attention will now turn to the draw on November 30 as Wales head for another major tournament.</p>
