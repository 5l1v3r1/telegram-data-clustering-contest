      </p>
      <p>Adams Oshiomhole, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), proved he is not a happy man on Tuesday, November 19, as he accused the deputy governor of Edo, Philip Shaibu, of betraying him after he helped the latter to <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a>.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole, who called Shaibu his 'son', lamented that the deputy governor tried to humiliate him by bringing thugs to the home of the national chairman of the APC in Iyamho, Edo state, recently.</p>
      <p>According to Oshiomhole, Shaibu is not the only one that had betrayed him. He said some other people he had helped while he was governor have turned their backs on him because they got contracts from the state government.</p>
      <p>Stressing that he was disappointed in Shaibu, Oshiomhole said even in death, he would not have believed that the deputy governor would join forces with those fighting him.</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that Oshiomhole made the comments when he received some supporters in Iyamho.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“There is nothing I have done in life that I didn’t have to fight for, but as you can see by the special grace of God there is no fight that I was forced into that I have not prevailed because I do not go out of my way to look for trouble.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The only thing I will say today to anyone who is here who is an agent of my son...when I talk of my son, I am talking of Philip Shiabu who now thinks that his own political future requires that he attacks me and import thugs to disgrace me in my village...,"</i> Oshiomhole said.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole, who called on God to take control, added: <i>“Supposing I was dead after 2016 and somebody tells me that my son Philip will organise people to attack my house or to attack my village to disrupt the convocation maybe my body will be turning in heaven and I will not believe it."</i></p>
      <p>He noted that in the 2016 governorship election in Edo, Shaibu did not win his polling unit because his people rejected him because they may have known him far more than he (Oshiomhole) knew.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He, however, said during that period, he stood by Shaibu to become the deputy governor.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"If all that transpired now is to use that power to humiliate me but God forbid… as you can see, who can fight the battle, it is only God, so I leave the burden of guilt to them.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>‘’I will not repay evil with evil. I will stand on the path of peace. I will stand on the path of unity. I will stand on the path of justice because I know that God in heaven will never allow the evildoer to prevail,"</i> he said.</p>
