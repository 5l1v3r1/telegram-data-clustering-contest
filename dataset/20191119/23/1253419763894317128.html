      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 gets a new 2.9GB update, resolves CPU issues and numerous crashes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:36:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:36</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Rockstar has released a brand new update for the PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2. The November 19th update, which is 2.9GB in size, brings improvements to address an issue that resulted in stalls on 4-core and 6-core CPUs.</p>
      <p>Moreover, this patch aims to fix numerous crashes. For instance, it addresses the issues that resulted in random crashes. It also addresses the “Red Dead Redemption 2 exited unexpectedly” error during gameplay. As such, I know hope that I will be able to play the game in DX12 without the game crashing in towns.</p>
      <p>Do note that this patch will reset your graphics settings. As such, you’ll have to manually adjust your settings to their previous values. This will be a pain in the ass for those that were using custom settings and not a preset.</p>
      <p>But anyway, the Rockstar Games Store and the Epic Games Store launchers will download this patch the next time you launch their clients. Below you can also find its complete changelog.</p>
