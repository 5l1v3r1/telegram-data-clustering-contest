      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> was reduced to tears on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here after facing her fear of spiders.</p>
      <p>The latest bushtucker trial saw the celebrities in Snake Rock have to retrieve stars while wearing a helmet that was filled with a variety of insects.</p>
      <p>The actress came to face to face with spiders when it was her turn to face the challenge, with more spiders being added to the box she had to place her hands into to retrieve the stars.</p>
      <p>Each star symbolised food for the camp, so she was keen to succeed for the other celebs.</p>
      <p>And succeed she did, not only completing the challenge but doing so in record time. Smashed it.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star was clearly shaken after the trial as the spiders were quickly brushed off her.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline teared up as she was hugged by her fellow campmates including Ian Wright, Caitlyn Jenner and James Haskell.</p>
      <p>Shaking she sat down with the other and furiously wiped her eyes.</p>

      <p>Host Declan Donnelly asked: ‘Can you believe you’ve just done that?’</p>
      <p>She replied: ‘Literally the whole time…I can’t talk. My mouth’s so dry.</p>
      <p>‘The whole time I’ve been talking about doing this, that’s the one thing, the head when you can’t flick them off your head. And spiders. I can’t even get a spider out of my toilet!’</p>
      <p>The Snake Rock residents proudly went back to camp with seven stars in total.</p>
      <p>Ian, James and Andrew Wakeman all managed to bag one star while Caitlyn also retrieved her two stars.</p>
      <p>For dinner that night the camp mates enjoyed Possum Chicory, lotus roots, kohlrabi and artichoke heart with pineapple for dessert.</p>
      <p>The next bushtucker trial will be the dreaded eating challenge.</p>
