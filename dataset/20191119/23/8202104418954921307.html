      <h3>A national cycling advocacy group said a proposed rule in Saskatoon to require a one-metre buffer for cyclists when passing pedestrians signifies a bigger problem.</h3>
      <p>Anders Swanson, chair of the board of Canada Bikes, said in an interview on Tuesday that he is unaware of any other jurisdiction in the country with a similar rule.</p>
      <p>The rule was proposed and endorsed by city council on Monday as part of a revamped bicycle bylaw. Councillors said the proposal came in response to pedestrians complaining about being startled by cyclists along the Meewasin Trail system.</p>
      <p>“Conflicts between people on bicycles and people on foot are usually a symptom of a jurisdiction that hasn’t planned for cycling properly,” Swanson said.</p>
      <p>Cities need to prepare for more people cycling and Saskatoon has “become infamous across Canada for removing a protected bike lane,” he added.</p>
      <p>Council voted in April to remove a protected bike lane as part of a pilot project on Fourth Avenue downtown.</p>
      <p>The proposed buffer zone represents a move in the wrong direction, Swanson said, noting other cities have found more effective ways to address pedestrian-cyclist conflicts.</p>
      <p>“Fundamentally, people on foot and people on bicycles are allies,” he said. “Cities across Canada need to focus on things that work.”</p>
      <p>Cathy Watts, co-chair of the Saskatoon Cycles lobby group, pointed out in an email that there are areas, such as the multi-use paths on some of the older downtown bridges, where there is not enough room for a one-metre buffer.</p>
      <p>“I think it would be better to put some real effort into education for everybody,” Watts said. “Cyclists need to be really polite to pedestrians.”</p>
      <p>Saskatoon Cycles provided a comprehensive submission on the new cycling bylaw, but Coun. Randy Donauer proposed the pedestrian-cyclist buffer on Monday night. Council endorsed the proposed revision in a 9-2 vote.</p>
      <p>Donauer said he kept the proposal vague so the city administration could come back with a provision that addressed issues like insufficient space.</p>
      <p>The city’s senior transportation engineer, Marina Melchiorre, who conducted research on the revisions, also said she had not found a jurisdiction with a similar pedestrian-cyclist buffer.</p>
      <p>The rule changes also include a one-metre buffer for motor vehicles and cyclists when there is sufficient space on the road.</p>
      <p>“People who walk need to get rid of their ear buds (plugs) when they are sharing space on a multi-use trail or on the bridges,” Watts added. “Also, walk close to one side.”</p>
      <p>The City of Saskatoon’s transportation department does not track collisions between cyclists and pedestrians.</p>
      <p>The StarPhoenix attempted on Tuesday to contact Walking Saskatoon, a pedestrian lobby group. The Meewasin Valley Authority, which maintains the river valley trail system, could not provide a comment on Tuesday.</p>
