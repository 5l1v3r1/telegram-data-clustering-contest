        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals">Black Friday 2019</a> is on November 29, but deals have already begun to surface.</li>
        <li>As an early Black Friday deal, Amazon Music Unlimited is offering new members access to tens of millions of songs for <a href="https://amzn.to/2XcFDpW">$0.99 for the first four months</a> (regularly priced at $7.99 per month).</li>
        <li>There are plenty of other deals coming up soon on Amazon, but you can expect some of the retailer’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-black-friday-deals">best Black Friday deals</a> will be on its own products and services.</li>

      <p>The competition for the best <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-deals">Black Friday 2019 deals</a> is already heating up, despite the fact that it doesn’t actually begin until November 29. Amazon is already offering deals, like four months of access to its premium streaming service <a href="https://amzn.to/2XcFDpW">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> for just $1 (for new subscribers only).</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2XcFDpW">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> is basically the retailer’s version of Spotify. It gives you access to over 50 million songs, including new releases, and you can listen commercial-free on pretty much any device – including your computer, tablet, and phone – via <a href="https://amzn.to/2XcFDpW">an app</a>.</p>
      <p>The service generally costs $7.99 a month for Prime members or $9.99 a month for non-members. If you want to check out a full review of the service and how it works, Reporter Remi Rosmarin has got you covered – just click the article below.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The $1 Amazon Music Unlimited access is only going on for a limited time, so new members should <a href="https://amzn.to/2YjyGQ0">take advantage of the deal</a> before the offer is over. Once the promotion ends, you can either cancel your membership or continue to pay the full $7.99 rate.</p>
      <p>Considering that this trial will set you back only $1, it’d be a shame to subject yourself to all those half-played samples on your Echo for the next four months.</p>
