      <p>Steve Clarke insists the future is bright for Scotland as they look to claim a Nations League golden ticket to next summer’s European Championships.</p>
      <p>Clarke’s side brought their doomed Euro 2020 qualifying campaign to an end as they beat Kazakhstan 3-1 at Hampden.</p>
      <p>But they will have a second chance at booking a place in their first major finals since 1998 next March thanks to the Nations League play-off slot secured by his predecessor Alex McLeish.</p>
      <p>The Scots – who will have home advantage for the single-leg semi-final – will discover who from Bulgaria, Hungary, Israel and Romania they will face when the draw is made on Friday.</p>
      <p>Norway or Serbia will await the winner but Clarke is confident his side can finally end their long stint in the international wilderness.</p>
      <p>He said: “With this group of players, I can be very optimistic about the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“They are 100 percent committed to their country and are desperate to get to a major finals at Euro 2020. So we can be very optimistic.”</p>
      <p>There were less than 20,000 inside Hampden to see two goals from John McGinn either side of a Steven Naismith header secure victory.</p>
      <p>But many would have been forgiven for thinking they were about to see a repeat of the Scots’ catastrophic Group I opener, when the team then bossed by McLeish slumped 3-0 to the Kazakhs during a dismal defeat in Nursultan.</p>
      <p>The hosts were booed off at half-time after defender Scott McKenna allowed Baktiyor Zainutdinov to lash the visitors ahead with a stunning 34th-minute opener but Clarke was pleased with his side’s reaction.</p>
      <p>“I thought the performance was good – good in the first half and really good in the second half against a dangerous opponent,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We knew if we made mistakes in possession, Kazakhstan could hurt us on the counter-attack which they did when they took the lead.</p>
      <p>“But it was a great reaction from the players, in the second half particularly.</p>
      <p>“We played a lot of good stuff, looked a threat going forward and created a lot of chances.</p>
      <p>“It’s another win – three wins in a row. I don’t know about anyone else, but the boys in the dressing room are feeling good about themselves.”</p>
      <p>Clarke has yet to see Hampden anywhere near full since taking the job on back in the summer.</p>
      <p>But he expects to see the Tartan Army turn out in numbers to roar Scotland to Euro 2020, which will see four games staged in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“I’ve no preferences for the draw,” said the manager.</p>
      <p>“You take what you get. It will be nice to have a little bit of clarity so we can actually start planning for the March games.</p>
      <p>“We’ll be at home (in the semi) and I think we’ve shown tonight we can be a good team here at Hampden.</p>
      <p>“That place will be full I’m sure. We’ll get a good atmosphere, get the team like that on the front foot and we can be OK.</p>
      <p>“It will be nice (to see the stadium rocking). I’ve been here a few times myself as a supporter when it’s been like that.</p>
      <p>“It’s a long way away though. We can enjoy tonight and the fact it’s three wins in a row.</p>
      <p>“But we know we still have a lot of work to do. We’re not getting carried away thinking we’ve cracked it.</p>
      <p>“I said before Cyprus I could see signs of improvement, little things in training, little things in the games that were getting better and we were improving.</p>
      <p>“I said that until we started getting results I couldn’t start shouting about it but hopefully other people can see there has been a little step forward.”</p>
