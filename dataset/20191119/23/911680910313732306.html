      <p>GUADALUPE, AZ â€” A teenage boy alerted his school resource officer to illicit sexual encounters between a fellow student and an adult man.</p>
      <p>MCSO reports that on November 12 they responded to a school in Tempe after a school resource officer was made aware of a sexual relationship between an adult man and a girl under 15 years old.</p>
      <p>A student was concerned about a friend and allegedly told the school resource officer that a man, later identified as Luis Alberto Estrada, 23, was sexually involved with her.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Department of Child Safety was brought in to investigate and determine that Estrada had multiple sexual encounters with the girl. MCSO detectives located Estrada the next day in Guadalupe and questioned him.</p>
      <p>Detectives say Estrada admitted to his actions, saying, "he broke multiple laws and could be locked away."</p>
      <p>He is being held on a $50,000 bond for sexual conduct with a minor.</p>
