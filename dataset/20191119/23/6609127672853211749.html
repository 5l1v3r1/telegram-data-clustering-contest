      <p>That took his tally to seven goals in his last six international appearances and boss Clarke has tipped him to be a main man in the play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>He said: “John’s on a fantastic run of form.</p>
      <p>“He has been great for Aston Villa for the last couple of seasons and he is starting to bring it onto the international stage.</p>
      <p>“It’s very important to remember he is still in the early stages of his international career.</p>

      <p>“The more games you play at this level, the better you become. The more experience you get, the better the team will become.</p>
      <p>“When you’ve got any player in goalscoring form that’s good for any team.</p>
      <p>“John is the man scoring the goals right now and hopefully we’ll get one or two more that can to that as well.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve found a good position for John. He’s playing it very well.</p>
      <p>"Him and Steven Naismith are developing a decent understanding and as well as the goals they give us a good early press and the desire to meet the opposition high up the pitch which helps us.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> fell behind to a strike from Baktiyor Zainutdinov before McGinn levelled early in the second half to become the first Scotland player to score in three successive games since James McFadden in 2007.</p>
      <p>Naismith then fired Clarke’s men ahead after 64 minutes before McGinn grabbed his second.</p>
      <p>Clarke said: “I thought the performance was good in the first half and really good in the second half.</p>

      <p>“We knew if we made mistakes in possession, Kazakhstan could hurt us on the counter-attack which they did when they took the lead.</p>
      <p>“But it was a great reaction, in the second half particularly.</p>
      <p>“We played a lot of good stuff and created a lot of chances. Nine shots on target is good. It’s another win, three in a row. The boys are feeling good about themselves.</p>
      <p>“Football is a 95 or 97 minute game and you have to build into the game. We managed to up the tempo at the start of the second half.</p>
      <p>“We moved the ball a little bit quicker, got behind them better and created more chances.”</p>
      <p>Scotland will now play Bulgaria, Hungary, Israel or Romania in the play-off semi-final on March 26, with the draw on Friday.</p>
      <p>The final four days later would be against either Norway or Serbia.</p>
      <p>Clarke added: “With this group of players, I can be very optimistic about the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“They are 100 per cent committed to their country and desperate to get to a major finals.</p>
      <p>“It will be nice to have a little bit of clarity, so we can start planning for the March games.”</p>
