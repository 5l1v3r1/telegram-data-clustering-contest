      <h1>Revealed: how African gangs panic backfired on Victorian Liberals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:59:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author">Noel Towell and Benjamin Preiss</a></address>
      <p>A scathing review of the Coalition's 2018 state election campaign found that Victorian voters saw the Liberals' "African gangs" scare campaign as a "political tactic" rather than a plan to make the state safer.</p>
      <p>The party’s official report into the campaign, released to members on Wednesday morning, also roasts those responsible for arranging a lobster dinner with then-leader Matthew Guy and Tony Madafferi, who police allege is the head of Melbourne’s mafia.</p>

      <p>The dinner organisers, the report said, were “guilty of utter stupidity”.</p>
      <p>Mr Madafferi denies any Mafia connections or wrongdoing and has never been charged with any offence.</p>
      <p>The party's money troubles and the "disruption' of the leadership turmoil that dogged the Liberals at federal level between 2015 and 2018 also rated mentions as contributing factors to the November 24 electoral meltdown.</p>

      <p>The internal report lays bare the full extent of the failure of the Coalition’s "law and order" led strategy, with post-election analysis revealing just 6 per cent of voters said the "Get Back in Control" agenda actually changed their vote – and not always in the Liberals’ favour.</p>
      <p>The report comes almost exactly a year after the Coalition’s humiliating state election loss, amid growing frustration from party members.</p>
      <p>The release averts a damaging showdown with party members, who planned to move a motion at this weekend's state council meeting calling on the administrative committee to release it.</p>
      <p>The review, by party elder Tony Nutt, found what little voters knew of Mr Guy was defined by his role in the alleged “Lobster with a Mobster” saga, and controversial decisions while he was planning minister.</p>
      <p>Labor exploited this reputation to its advantage.</p>
      <p>The election ended in catastrophic defeat for the Liberal-National Coalition, which lost 10 seats. The Coalition's primary vote plunged to just 35 per cent, with massive swings against MPs in some of their traditional heartland seats.</p>
      <p>Mr Nutt also said the Liberals had failed, in their years in Opposition, to tell the difference between "red hot issues" playing out in the media and critical strategic developments.</p>
      <p>"Key seat voters might be very unimpressed by the Red Shirts affair for instance," Mr Nutt wrote.</p>
      <p>"But the brutal reality was that it was not going to change their actual vote on polling day given more relevant, personal and compelling factors like delivery of local infrastructure."</p>
      <p>The veteran Liberal operative allowed some grudging praise for the Andrews government's political manoeuvring on issues like the Country Fire Authority, the East-West Link and Parliamentary expenses scandals.</p>
      <p>"Labor were...largely successful in riding out problems through superior issue management,<br/>rolling out new initiatives and changing the subject," Mr Nutt wrote in his review.</p>
