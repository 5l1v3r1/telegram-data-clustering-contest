      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Uncontrollable and extended bouts of laughter as a symptom sound, well, a little funny. But to a Hawaii man who’d struggled with it for years, it was anything but.</p>
      <p>The curious medical case was presented to residents studying at the UH-Manoa John A. Burns School of Medicine, who wrote about the patient in the <a href="http://hawaiijournalhealth.org/">Hawaii Journal of Medicine and Social Welfare</a>.</p>
      <p>They said they determined that the laughter was actually a gelastic seizure, a rare form of epilepsy.</p>
      <p>“They are highly associated with abnormal cognitive development and behavioral problems in patients,” the physician trainees wrote.</p>
      <p>The man started suffering from the laughing fits when he was 8, and they’d occur two to three times a week. The patient also had a history of a brain tumor, diabetes and schizophrenia.</p>
      <p>With medication, the laughing fits ― which some assumed were a behavioral issue ― were brought under control.</p>
      <p>Nina Leialoha Beckwith<b>,</b> a family medicine resident at JABSOM who worked on the case with fellow trainees under the supervision of Dr. Kore Kai Liow, called the case “medically intriguing.” “Prior to this case, I didn’t know seizures could manifest in such a way as uncontrollable laughter.” she said.</p>
