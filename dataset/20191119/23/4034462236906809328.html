      <h1>Fast &amp; Furious Is About To Get Even Less Realistic</h1>
      <h2>A new Fast &amp; Furious spin-off is racing onto Netflix next month.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:00:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The Fast &amp; Furious series prides itself on defying the laws of physics. Throughout the nine movies that have been released so far, we've seen a Lykan Hypersport smash through multiple skyscrapers, cars parachute from the sky, and two <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/3-reasons-why-that-furious-7-lykan-hypersport-double-skyscraper-jump-is-possible">Dodge Chargers</a> drag a ten-ton bank vault down city streets.</p>
      <p>And yet, somehow, the series is about to get even less realistic, as <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/fast-furious-animated-series-racing-onto-netflix">new animated spin-off show</a> called 'Fast &amp; Furious: Spy Racers' is airing on Netflix next month. Switching to animation means we can expect the car stunts to be even crazier than the live-action films.</p>

      <p>After releasing a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/here-s-your-first-look-at-the-all-new-fast-furious#comments">short teaser trailer</a> giving us a sneak peek at the show's racing action back in July, Netflix has released new photos and announced the cast list for the new animated series. Produced by DreamWorks Animation, 'Fast &amp; Furious: Spy Racers' centers on teenager Tony Toretto, the cousin of Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel, and his friends who are recruited by a government agency to "infiltrate an elite racing league serving as a front for a nefarious crime organization called SH1FT3R bent on world domination." Tony Toretto will be played by 'Teen Wolf' star Tyler Posey.</p>
      <p>Other cast members include Camille Ramsey (American Vandal) as underground racer Layla Gray, Luke Youngblood (Harry Potter) as 13-year old tech genius Frostee Benson, Charlet Chung (Overwatch) as talented artist Echo, and Jorge Diaz (Jane the Virgin) as Cisco Renaldo, who acts as "the muscle and the sweetheart of the crew."</p>

      <p>You'll notice that none of the characters from the main Fast &amp; Furious films are returning, but Vin Diesel acts as Executive Producer with Neal H. Moritz and Chris Morgan, who have all served as producers on the live-action Fast &amp; Furious film franchise. Sticking with the franchise's "family" theme, Vin Diesel's daughter, Similce Diesel, will guest star in the series as Frostee's younger sister Sissy.</p>
      <p>While the show will no doubt feature lots of automotive action, none of the cars shown in photos or the teaser trailer appear to be licensed, sadly, although the muscle car featured in the show's main art is clearly inspired by the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/challenger-coupe">Dodge Challenger</a>. 'Fast &amp; Furious: Spy Racers' is racing onto Netflix on December 26.</p>
