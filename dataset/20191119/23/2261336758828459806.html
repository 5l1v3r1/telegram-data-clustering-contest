      <h1>Dana White: Weili Zhang vs. Joanna Jedrezjczyk is ‘going to be a very fun fight!’</h1>

      <p>It seems Joanna Jedrezjczyk did enough to earn herself a title shot.</p>

Jedrezjczyk and reigning champion Weili Zhang recently exchanged barbs on social media.</p>

      <p>“Anywhere, anytime,” Jedrezjcyzk said of a fight with Zhang. “Bangkok, Sri Lanka, Warsaw, Toronto, it doesn’t matter where... I will make it to China and beat the s—t out of her.”</p>
      <p>“She seems very angry,” Zhang replied on Instagram. “Don’t worry she will calm down. I am ready now. Call my manger or call Dana White. I’m ready.”</p>

      <p>The back-and-forth led UFC President Dana White to suggest the two are scheduled to fight. “This is going to be a VERY fun fight!!!!!” White wrote on Instagram. Zhang commented on White’s post and again confirmed, “we’re ready.”</p>
