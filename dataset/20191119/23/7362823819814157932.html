      <h1>Hitler's birthplace to be turned into police station after years of legal wrangling</h1>

      <p>The birthplace of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science/hitlers-vegetable-garden-discovered-secret-headquarters">Adolf Hitler</a> will be turned into a police station, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">Austrian</a> officials said Tuesday, after a years-long legal battle intended to keep the building from becoming a shrine to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/germany-dresden-nazi-emergency">Nazi</a> leader.</p>
      <p>The yellow home in the Austrian town of Braunau near the German border was taken over by the government in 2016, The Guardian reported.</p>
      <p>“The house’s future usage by the police should set a clear signal that this building will never be a place to commemorate Nazism,” Austria's Interior Ministry said.</p>

      <p>The building will be remodeled following a ruling by Austria's highest court that its owner, Gerlinde Pommer, was entitled to $900,000 in compensation after she let it fall into disrepair. Pommer had been renting the 8,600-square-foot property to the government since the 1970s.</p>
      <p>The building was used as a center for people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The arrangement fell apart in 2011 when she refused to renovate the building and declined to sell it, sparking a legal battle with the government. The interior ministry wanted to tear it down at one point, but received pushback from politicians and historians.</p>
      <p>The amount awarded to Pommer was less than she asked for but more than what she had been previously offered, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/19/austria-to-turn-adolf-hitlers-birthplace-into-police-station?CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574200611">paper</a> said.</p>

      <p>Hitler was born in the home on April 20, 1889 but spent only a short time at the property. He became the leader of Germany's Nazi Party whose Third Reich murdered 6 million Jewish people during <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/world-war-two">World War II</a>.</p>
      <p>The building continues to lure Nazi sympathizers from around the world. Anti-fascist protesters rally outside the building each year on his birthday.</p>
