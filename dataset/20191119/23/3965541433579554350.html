      <p>An incredible tale of lost and found ended right here in Portland.</p>
      <p>Viktor Usov, who lives in our area, lost his cat Sasha five years ago.</p>
      <p>He reported him missing, but as time went on, he started to lose hope that he would ever see him again.</p>
      <p>Then he got a call from an animal shelter in New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Somehow, Sasha had traveled more than 1,000 miles and ended up in Santa Fe.</p>
      <p>He was microchipped, which is how the shelter figured out who he belonged to.</p>
      <p>After word got out, American Airlines offered to fly Sasha back to Portland, along with someone from the shelter.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, the cat and the owner were reunited at PDX.</p>
      <p>"It's crazy. I've been at the shelter for five years. I’ve talked to people that’s worked in the shelter business for over a decade, and they've never heard of an animal traveling 12-hundred miles," said Murad Kirdar with Santa Fe Animal Shelter.</p>

      <p>Viktor thinks Sasha must have hitched a ride with someone to get so far away.</p>
      <p>He said he’s just glad to have the cat back.</p>
