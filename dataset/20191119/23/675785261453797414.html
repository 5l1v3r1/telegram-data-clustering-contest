      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: The Truth will oust the Tories from power</h1>
      <h2>The TV debate showed that real choice is between Labour’s change for the better and more of the same from the tired Tories, the Voice of the Mirror writes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:44:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:44</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>Cynical liar <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> failing to answer a question about truth and personal integrity, with the studio audience laughing at him, summed up an evasive TV performance.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> ’s more honest, direct approach was a refreshing contrast in the first head-to-head of the election campaign.</p>
      <p>Corbyn swotted Johnson with the observation we’ve endured nine years of coalition chaos under the Tories and he also scored heavily by condemning NHS suffering and privatisation under the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Johnson sounded a stranger to the truth, so voters are right to ask if they can trust a Tory with a history of lies and broken promises.</p>
      <p>This battle is about much more than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , no matter how important Britain’s future in or out of Europe is to a section of the electorate.</p>
      <p>We saw last night the real choice is between Labour’s change for the better and more of the same from the tired Tories.</p>
      <h3>Stop the abuse</h3>

      <p>There can be no justice for victims of domestic violence when more than 10,000 abusers are walking our streets free, cash-strapped police forces too stretched to enact arrest warrants.</p>
      <p>Tory cuts to law and order are criminally unfair when the women beaten by brutal partners and husbands are denied proper protection and those accused of unspeakable offences escape the enfeebled arm of the law.</p>
      <p>The Tories have failed to take domestic violence seriously – many more people die at the hands of pitiless partners than terrorists, yet spending’s significantly higher combating terrorism than inhuman brutality in homes.</p>
      <p>We need to safeguard the abused – and punish the abusers.</p>

      <p>A blessing from the Dalai Lama for our Million Trees campaign is an unexpected blossoming to green the country.</p>
      <p>Put down deep roots and this will be a better land with the support of Tibet’s spiritual leader.</p>
