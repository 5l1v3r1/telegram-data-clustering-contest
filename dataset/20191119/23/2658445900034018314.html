      <p>Fake seeds are like counterfeit drugs. They are capable of harming the plan of the Federal Government to make agriculture the mainstay of the country’s economy. All over the world, the agricultural sector is the strength of the economy, which employs a vast majority of people.</p>
      <p>Experts say the population of the country is growing at an alarming rate which makes it imperative to double productivity to meet the rising demands for food.</p>
      <p>It is also the view of experts that quality seed is one veritable tool to achieve the vision of food sufficiency in the country.</p>
      <p>Relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government are steadily keying into the agenda to make the country not only food sufficient, but to produce for export.</p>
      <p>One government agency that has concluded arrangements to take the bull by the horns to reposition the agricultural value chain in the country is the National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC).</p>
      <p>The council’s mandate is to ensure circulation of adequate quality and quantity of seeds in Nigeria, across West Africa and other regions.</p>
      <p>That seed is central to agriculture is not in doubt, it is also not questionable the fact that the attention you give to seed determines your productivity and how far you can go.</p>
      <p>What may be in doubt, experts say, is the level of acceptability of improved seedlings by Nigerian farmers.</p>
      <p>NASC Director-General, Dr. Olusegun Ojo is, however, not leaving any stone unturned in his effort to popularise and carry out the mandate of the council.</p>
      <p>Ojo said as much when he spoke in Abuja about the activities of NASC and the determination of the council to take the benefits of quality seeds to the door steps of Nigerians.</p>
      <p>For Ojo, the value of the seed industry in the country and the value that can be attained in about 2030 is enormous.</p>
      <p>According to him, “assumed current value of about N150 billion for selected cereals and legumes food security crops, by 2030 the value will be well over N200 billion for these crops which include maize, rice, sorghum, cotton, cowpea, groundnut, millet and soybean”.</p>
      <p>On the role of seed to agricultural productivity, he said they regulate to introduce sanity into the system to prevent confusion and ensure that farmers are protected.</p>
      <p>He said without necessary regulation, “it implies farmers will be defrauded and eventually, we will be unable to meet our food and raw material need as a country”.</p>
      <p>Ojo said NASC is not capable to do the duty alone. “Our approach is that we encourage the entire community to work with us to sanitise the system. Our manpower is insufficient and as government revenue is dwindling so is our manpower and logistics. For staff security in the execution of their duties, we partner with the various law enforcement organs of government to support us. We enjoy a very cordial relationship with the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps for example.”</p>
      <p>Increase in yield per hectare and land expansion are also said to be two factors which determine agricultural growth.</p>
      <p>In the country, land expansion is said to have remained the key driver of growth. Experts say yield per hectare has been low due to low use of high quality input particularly seeds. So, a simple tool that can transform agricultural productivity significantly at very minimal cost is the utilisation of good quality seeds, the council insists.</p>
      <p>Asked how compliant the commercial seed entrepreneurs have been to the council’s standards and whether he would say the seed sector is living up to expected standards, the NASC boss noted that they have been dynamic and “we need to commend them for their effort in the past few years, our progress in the rice and maize sector for example is partly due to the deployment of quality seeds from these commercial seed entrepreneurs. We have room also for improvement because we have not reached our destination”.</p>
      <p>The DG is also convinced that farmers can harvest more than double their current yield through the use of certified protected plant varieties through the introduction of Plant Variety Protection (PVP).</p>
      <p>On NASC partnership with various seed enterprises Ojo said partnership is their key strategy for success. “That is why we continue to partner various organisations whether government, private, NGO, CBO, CSO, media, financial institutions, security agencies name it. We are open to work and collaborate with all to usher in quality seeds in Nigeria.”</p>
      <p>On the membership of international bodies that deal with seeds and what Nigerian stands to benefit, he said: “We are strategically making effort to ensure that Nigeria is on the global seed map and we benefit from the multibillion dollar seed economy. This we can do in partnership with the various international seed bodies.</p>
      <p>“We are currently making effort to be a strong nation in the World Seed Partnership and that is why we are seriously doing all to become member of bodies such as the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA), the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV), the Seed Scheme of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Seed Federation (ISF), the Africa Seed Trade Association (AFSTA), Africa Seeds.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The world is a global economy and we cannot operate in isolation and so our membership with these organisations will boost seed trade and also help curb dumping of substandard quality seeds in Nigeria.”</p>
      <p>The NASC DG described the country’s agriculture future with seeds as “very bright” because “seeds with other inputs and good agricultural practices will take us to the right place”.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one strategic initiative of NASC may be the disclosure that it has concluded arrangements to commence the digital coding and labeling of certified seeds (SeedCodex) for farming.</p>
      <p>SeedCodex, it said, will commence effective from the early farming season of year 2020.</p>
      <p>Findings showed that the SeedCodex initiative, which is an electronic verification and authentication system introduced to enhance efficiency of the council’s seed certification process, was launched about two months ago.</p>
      <p>The DG said it involves using digital codes hidden under a scratchable veneer, which when sent to appropriate telephone line, promptly give feedback on the authenticity or otherwise of the seed sample in any receptacle, be it a bag, a can or any other form of container.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Ojo believes that the introduction of this technology will help to bring transparency into seed supply chain and expose those doing sharp practices as each set of numbers is peculiar to specific containers.</p>
      <p>He added that the planned coded labeling of seed containers was part of the council’s ongoing quality seed assurance initiatives being undertaken to ensure that dealers in sub-standard seeds are denied the opportunity of benefitting from dubious practices, including adulteration, in the seeds market and ensuring that farmers get the best seeds for farming.</p>
      <p>For the SeedCodex initiative, NASC boss said they have trained seed certification officers as well as inaugurated seed committees across the states and oriented the Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) personnel to ensure that sub-standard seeds are eliminated in the seed industry.</p>
      <p>The seed expert noted that through the collaboration of relevant agencies such as the NSCDC, the council would ensure that any seed container without the codex label would be impounded and owners handed to the law enforcement agencies for prosecution.</p>
      <p>According to him, “we are committed as a Council statutorily mandated to regulate the seed industry to ensuring that the peddlers or fake seed companies do not have a place in our seed market. The Seed Codex initiative is one of several measures and innovative strategies we are adopting to rid the Nigerian seed market of adulterated seeds.</p>
      <p>“This is important to us because we appreciate that seed quality is crucial to having quality crops from our farmers for feeding, processing for local and global markets.”</p>
      <p>The NASC boss did not end the briefing without talking about the amended Seed Act and its effect on the mandate of the council.</p>
      <p>He said: “The process of amendment started about 12 years ago. The bill was amended by the 6th and 7th National Assembly, but was not assented due to the dynamic nature of the industry and the need to include other key provisions in the thinking of the government of the period.</p>
      <p>“However, we thank God that the 8th Assembly seeing the importance of the Seed Act passed the bill again into law and this time it received the assent of Mr. President.”</p>
