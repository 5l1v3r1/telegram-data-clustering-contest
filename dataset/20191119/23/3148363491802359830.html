      <h1>Vindman Says Ukraine Offered Him Defense Minister Post Three Times</h1>
      <h2>National Security Council official Alexander Vindman testified Tuesday during the third public impeachment inquiry hearing that Ukraine’s then-head of National Security and Defense Council Oleksandr Danylyuk offered him the position of defense minister three times.</h2>

      <p>Vindman said one of the times came when he was visiting Ukraine for the newly-elected president’s inauguration in May.</p>
      <p>“At any point during that trip did Mr. Danylyuk offer you a position of defense minister with the Ukrainian government?” the Republican counsel Steve Castor asked Vindman.</p>
      <p>“He did,” Vindman said.</p>
      <p>“And how many times did he do that?” Castor asked.</p>
      <p>“I believe it was three times,” Vindman.</p>
      <p>“And do you have any reason why he asked you to do that?” Castor asked.</p>
      <p>“No, I don’t know, but every single time I dismissed it, upon returning I notified my chain of command and appropriate counterintelligence folks about the offer,” Vindman said.</p>
      <p>“That was a big honor, correct?” Castor asked.</p>
      <p>Vindman, who immigrated from Ukraine to America as a child, responded:</p>
      <blockquote>I think it would be a great honor, and frankly I’m aware of service members that have left service to help nurture the developing democracies in that part of the world.</blockquote>
      <p>But, he added, “I’m an American, I came here as a toddler and immediately dismissed these offers, I did not entertain them.”</p>
      <p>He called the notion “comical,” since he was just a lieutenant colonel, and he said he did not leave the door open at all.</p>
      <p>“These are honorable people, I’m not sure if he meant it as a joke or not,” he said.</p>
      <p>Later in the hearing, Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) slammed Castor for asking about it.</p>
      <p>“The three minutes that were spent asking you about the offer made to make you the new minister of defense — that may have come cloaked in a Brooks Brothers suit and in parliamentary language, but that was designed exclusively to give the right-wing media an opening to question your loyalty,” he argued.</p>
