      <h2>BIS had collected piped drinking water samples from Delhi and 20 other cities including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata for testing.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:26:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Of the 11 water samples picked up from Delhi which failed Bureau of Indian Standards quality tests, one was taken from the 12, Janpath, house of Union Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ram-vilas-paswan">Ram Vilas Paswan</a>, and another from Krishi Bhavan.</p>
      <p>According to the BIS report, all 11 samples failed on 19 parametres. BIS had collected piped drinking water samples from Delhi and 20 other cities including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata for testing.</p>
      <p>The remaining nine samples in Delhi were picked up from Mukundpur, Nand Nagri, Burari (two samples), Ashok Nagar, Janta Vihar, Sonia Vihar, Mandoli Village and Kapil Vihar in Pitampura.</p>
      <p>Bhagwan Din, a resident of Janta Vihar in North West Delhi, said a sample had been picked up from his house three months ago. “I had registered a complaint regarding poor water quality. Some officials came and took samples. We have been facing issues with water quality… It has been solved now,” he said.</p>
      <p>Anil Kumar, a resident of Mandoli village, had also complained about the quality of water, after which a sample was taken from his house.“I don’t know which office the people who collected samples came from, but I had complained to DJB before that,” Kumar said.</p>
      <p>He said that a new pipeline was laid near his house and water quality had been affected ever since. “The colony next to mine gets clean water but quality in my area was affected,” he said.</p>
      <p>Anju Kumar, a resident of Ashok Nagar, said she had complained about poor water quality before a sample was taken from her house over a month ago.</p>
