      <h1>'Uniform civil code necessary for unity of country'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dhns" target="_blank">DHNS</a></address>
      <p>Yoga guru Baba Ramdev stressed on the need to introduce uniform civil code and a total ban on cow slaughter on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He was speaking at Sant Sammellan, organised as a part of his five-day free Yoga camp, at Rajangan in Sri Krishna Mutt.</p>
      <p>‘’A campaign needs to be initiated in order to pressurise the government on introducing the uniform civil code.’’</p>
      <p>Ramdev said people in the country should realise the importance of common civil code. He claimed that the architect of Constitution B R Ambedkar had himself vouched for uniform civil code.</p>
      <p>“Modi government should take the initiative to introduce uniform civil code,” he said and added that uniform civil code was necessary for the country in order to stay united.</p>
      <p>Ramdev again lashed out at the supporters of Periyar. He said people should take up nationalism as a weapon against the supporters of Periyar, who claimed that Lord Rama and Lord Krishna had massacred members of the present-day backward classes which is far from the truth. The communist ideologies should be attacked, he stressed.</p>
      <p>The yoga guru also favoured stringent laws against the slaughter of cattle. Indian Muslims should not take Mughals as their role model, he said and added that Muslims are Indians and they are the brothers of Hindus in India.</p>
      <p>They should also support the ban on cow slaughter, he said and added that there was a ban on cow slaughtering during the era of Babar, Humayun and Akbar.</p>
      <p>‘’Beef consumption is the reason behind global warming. He appealed meat consumers to consume any meat, including dog, cat, chicken and mutton, but not beef. If people consume cattle, they will also not hesitate to consume their parents,” he declared.</p>
      <p>Pejawar Mutt Pontiff Vishwesha Theertha Swami said the purification of River Ganga and ban on cow slaughter should be taken as a priority by the Centre.</p>
      <p>He said cattle should be declared as the national animal and not tiger. He suspected that the Supreme Court will come up with a contradicting judgement in allowing women into the Sabarimala temple.</p>
      <p>“Those opposing the entry of women into Mosques are supporting the idea of throwing open the doors of Sabarimala temple for women,’’ he said and added that the Ram Mandir will be built at the earliest and the country would be a Rama Rajya.</p>
