      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday (Nov 19) that <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/in-new-pro-israel-shift--us-no-longer-calls-settlements-illegal-12105482">the United States' reversal of its position on Israeli settlements</a> in the occupied Palestinian territory is an absurdity amounting to legalising land grabs by neighbours of the country.</p>
      <p>Commenting on reports quoting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Dr Mahathir said it was a blatant disregard of international laws and multiple United Nations resolutions.</p>

      <p>Pompeo announced that President Donald Trump’s administration did not view Israeli settlements in West Bank as illegal.</p>

      <p>“We are no longer safe. If a country wants to enter our country and build their settlements, that is legal. We cannot do anything,” Dr Mahathir was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s office.</p>
      <p>He also expressed fears that the timing of the Trump administration's announcement would further embolden the Israeli forces, which are now on a vicious killing spree in Gaza. Children are reportedly among the casualties.</p>
      <p>“You announce that their illegal settlements are not illegal at a time when they are conducting these unjustified attacks on Gaza … Isn’t it like encouraging them to continue to murder the children and civilians, and that they will not be punished?</p>

      <p>“Instead, they will be rewarded with setting up settlements on the land of the people they had killed and murdered,” Dr Mahathir said.</p>
      <p>The move by the Trump administration has drawn international outrage as the reversal departed from a State Department 1978 legal opinion that the settlements were inconsistent with international laws.</p>
