      <p><b>ANANTAPUR: </b>Telangana Governor Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan praised the Sri Satyasai Super Speciality Hospital for being the only institution in the country without cash billing counters and dedicated to the service of humanity.</p>
      <p>She recalled her devotion to Satya Saibaba who helped during every crisis and difficult situation. “Being a doctor and politician, I had overcome any such situations by putting all problems at the golden feet of Baba and leave the place much lighter in heart,” she said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As part of the ongoing 94th birth anniversary celebrations of Satya Saibaba at Prasanthi Nilayam, International Ladies Day was celebrated on Tuesday. Governor Soundararajan was the chief guest and offered floral tributes at the maha samadhi of Satya Saiba-ba. Addressing a gathering of women volunteers of Seva Dal from various countries, Dr Soundara-rajan stressed the role of women in building a nation at every level — as sister, wife, mother-in-law, and daughter-in-law.</p>
      <p>She recalled that Baba had started super speciality hospitals after he was advised to do so by his mother Easwaramma who sought medical aid for people in her home town. Dr Soundararajan obser-ved that the Satya Sai Super Speciality Hospital was the only hospital providing medical services free of cost.</p>
      <p>“As a doctor I observed many hospitals with cash billing counters, while the Satya Sai Super Speciality Hospitals have no cash billing counters,” she observed and added that she has been an ardent devotee of Baba and used to visit regularly at Sundaram in Chennai.</p>
      <p>The Governor called on women to abide by moral values to attain top goals.</p>
      <p>Ms Eeselilla, a judge from Hong Kong, said even though her country was in a critical condition she had to come to participate in this event to get the blessings of Baba.</p>
