      <p>Nigel Farage has failed to name a single thing he has done to help the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party leader was pressured to come up with examples of changes he has made to his personal behaviour and could only admit that he is not a ‘leading example’ on environmental issues.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage called for more green action and a massive increase in tree planting, in the second part of ITV’s General Election debate coverage this evening.</p>
      <p>But he conceded that he still drove and flew, which meant he could not claim to have made changes to his own life to help the environment.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘I drive all over the country, I catch a lot of aeroplane flights, I am not a leading example.</p>

      <p>Earlier today, Mr Farage called for a net migration cap of 50,000.</p>
      <p>He also said if he had to pick one political leader to go on I’m A Celeb with, it would be Boris Johnson – so that he could ‘share a bottle of something’ with the Prime Minister and find out what he ‘really believes’.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party and Greens also appeared, following the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/johnson-corbyn-clash-general-election-debate-11184324/">debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p>
