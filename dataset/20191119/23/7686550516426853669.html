      <p>As the dust settles on the historic ITV clash here's seven things we learned from the election debate.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over trust, Christmas presents and Brexit on Tuesday night in the first TV clash of the general election campaign.</p>
      <p>The powerful pair were challenged over trust by a blunt speaking audience that said what they meant.</p>
      <p>And audience members laughed as the Tory leader said the truth was important, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/itv-general-election-debate-7-20918352">Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was also quizzed on Prince Andrew saying he backed the monarchy while adding he'd get Jeremy Corbyn his Brexit deal for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Overall commentators suggested the debate was a draw with neither leader having enough time to properly discuss the issues.</p>
      <p>Here are 7 things we learned from the election debate...</p>
      <h3>1. Audience members didn't trust Boris Johnson</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Audience members in tonight's ITV election debate burst out laughing tonight as Boris Johnson said the truth matters.</p>
      <p>Asked by host Julie Etchingham "does truth matter", he replied: "I think it does". But then a ripple of laughter went through the audience - and someone shouted out at the PM, who was twice sacked from previous jobs for lying.</p>
      <p>And one of the stand-out moments from the debate was a damning condemnation of the state of politics from audience member Fahad Sayood.</p>
      <p>Mr Sayood told both leaders: "At the heart of this is one simple question - how can we trust you?</p>
      <p>"Under your leadership the debate has become toxic and degraded with an appalling level of lies and childish abuse.</p>
      <p>"How can this nation trust you to have the personal integrity and individual strength of character to look after our country's interests, rescue us from this mess, and bring us back together?"</p>
      <p>A YouGov snap poll found Boris Johnson won by 51 per cent to 49 per cent - but found Corbyn was more trustworthy, by 45 per cent to 40 per cent (15 per cent didn't know).</p>
      <h3>2. Jeremy Corbyn didn't have it easy either</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It wasn't all plain sailing for Jeremy Corbyn either.</p>
      <p>He suffered laughter as he said his Brexit position was "clear", despite Labour not yet knowing how it'll campaign in a second referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was grilled repeatedly by Boris Johnson over how Labour would campaign in a second vote.</p>
      <p>But he stuck to the line - that Labour will only decide that at a special conference after spending three months trying to strike its own Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>Other audience members laughed when Mr Corbyn said a four-day week would be "paid for by productivity increases" across the economy.</p>
      <h3>3. Corbyn denied he'd strike a deal with Nicola Sturgeon</h3>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said he would not be joining any coalition - and gave a snappy answer as to why.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: " <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> and the Labour Party, be in no doubt about it, in order to secure power and the keys to number 10 are going to do a deal, or probably already have done a deal with Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to form Corbyn-Sturgeon coalition and the price of that deal ... would be a second referendum on the union with Scotland."</p>
      <p>But Mr Cobyn branded that he was allowed to reply to this "nonsense" and said he would do no deals with the SNP.</p>
      <p>He quipped: "There has been nine years of chaotic coalitions already.”</p>
      <p>He added: "There's not going to be a coalition between Labour and anybody else. There are no deals that have been done and there will be no deals that are done."</p>
      <h3>4. Corbyn showed the NHS is his big attack line</h3>
      <p>Mr Corbyn accused the Prime Minister of conducting "secret meetings" with the US about the NHS and a future trade deal.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said: "What we know of what Mr Johnson has done is a series of secret meetings with the United States in which they were proposing to open up our NHS markets as they call them to American companies."</p>
      <p>He waved a document which he claimed backed up his point.</p>
      <p>"You’re going to sell our NHS over to the US!" he said.</p>
      <p>Responding, Mr Johnson said: "This is an absolute invention. It is completely untrue. There are no circumstances whatever in which this Government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."</p>
      <h3>5. And so is 'seven years' for a Tory Brexit deal</h3>

        <figcaption>Is Boris Johnson telling the truth about how long Brexit will take?<cite>(Image: ITV)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly said it would take seven years for Boris Johnson to strike a Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>It appears to be a new attack line, to take on Boris Johnson's claim that he will "get Brexit done" by January 31.</p>
      <p>The simple truth is that Brexit will not be done by then, because Boris Johnson then has to get a trade deal with the EU. A similar one between the EU and Canada took seven years.</p>
      <p>"You are not going to get it done in a few months and you know that perfectly well," Corbyn told the Tory leader.</p>
      <p>Whereas Labour's plan is to negotiate an exit deal in three months, and a referendum with Remain on the ballot paper three months after that.</p>
      <p>Of course, if Leave wins the second referendum, Labour's plan would also only take us out of the EU - we'd also then have to negotiate a future relationship.</p>
      <h3>6. Johnson said a social care policy will be in the Tory manifesto</h3>
      <p>There was very little new policy in the debate - apart from this.</p>
      <p>Asked if there'd be a policy on social care in the manifesto Boris Johnson said: "Yes there will.</p>
      <p>"And we think that nobody should pay for their cost of their social care, like selling their home.</p>
      <p>"And everybody should have dignity and security in their old age".</p>
      <p>The pledge not to make people sell their home to pay for care - as they have to currently - will be key here.</p>
      <p>Theresa May's "dementia tax" in the 2017 election tried to do this, but by making people sell up after they die. How will Boris Johnson square the circle? We don't know yet.</p>
      <h3>7. Johnson didn't like answering on Prince Andrew</h3>

        <figcaption>It was very awkward<cite>(Image: ITV)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Boris Johnson faced an awkward moment tonight as he was grilled on live TV over the crisis engulfing Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister was asked if the Duke of York was "fit for purpose" in a live studio showdown between himself and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>He said "the law must take its course" after the Duke refused to show remorse for his friendship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>But he did not comment further - and defiantly defended the monarchy itself as "beyond reproach”.</p>
      <p>Tonight's ITV debate came a day after the Tory leader laughed off the Duke's Newsnight interview, saying aid "nice try" when he was asked about it.</p>
