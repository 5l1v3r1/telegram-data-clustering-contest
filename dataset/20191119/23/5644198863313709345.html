      <p>ABU DHABI: Brazil returned to triumphant form after a five-game winless streak on Tuesday (Nov 19) with the recalled Philippe Coutinho starring in a 3-0 win over South Korea.</p>
      <p>In front of a sparse crowd in Abu Dhabi, Lucas Paqueta put Brazil 1-0 up in the ninth minute when he headed home from close range after excellent work on the left from Coutinho and Renan Lodi.</p>

      <p>Coutinho, who was recalled to the starting line-up after a couple of matches on the bench, made it 2-0 nine minutes before halftime when he curled a superb free kick into the corner of the net from 20 meters out.</p>
      <p>Danilo got his first international goal on the hour with a crisp strike from outside the box.</p>
      <p>The match extended South Korea’s poor run, with the Asian side now having gone three games without scoring.</p>
      <p>The friendly was Brazil’s last before they begin their qualifying campaign for the 2022 World Cup in March next year.</p>
