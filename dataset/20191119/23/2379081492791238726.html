      <h1>TorStar to shut down commuter newspapers across Canada</h1>
      <h2>Moves to digital-only editions in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Toronto and Halifax</h2>

      <p>Torstar Corp., the publisher of the Toronto Star and scores of community newspapers, is shutting its StarMetro print editions across Canada as the parent company copes with mounting losses.</p>
      <p>The final print editions of the commuter paper will be published Dec. 20, according to an emailed statement from Bob Hepburn, Torstar director of communications. The company publishes the StarMetro in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Toronto and Halifax.</p>
      <p>“We are going digital-only outside of Ontario as more and more of our commuter readers are using their smartphones, laptops and tablets to access their news on their way to and from work,” Hepburn said. “This trend, coupled with a corresponding decline in print advertising volumes, has decreased the need for a free daily commuter newspaper in these cities.”</p>
      <p>The move will result in 73 layoffs in the editorial, advertising and distribution departments, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Torstar last month reported third-quarter losses that doubled to $40.9 million from the same period a year ago.</p>
