      <p>As Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn went head to head tonight for the historic ITV debate ahead of the general election on December 12 there was something else that distracted viewers of all political persuasions.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn's choice of glasses.</p>
      <p>Twitter was full of pithy comments from people moaning about Corbyn's wonky specs and how they can barely focus on what he's saying because of them.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader appeared at the debate, wearing glasses which were clearly bent to one side.</p>
      <p>One Twitter user asked the question on everyone's lips: ‘Why are Jeremy Corbyn’s glasses crooked.’</p>
      <p>Another user added: ‘Jeremy Corbyn’s glasses are wonky and a little steamed up’.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Corbyn has earlier said he is receiving treatment for an eye condition at Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p>
      <p>Another user said: "The main attack line from the Tories right now appears to be Jeremy Corbyn's glasses are wonky."</p>
      <p>"Jeremy Corbyn’s glasses appear to be winning the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ITVDebate?src=hashtag_click">#ITVDebate</a> ," commented another.</p>
      <p>Twitter users have even come up with a name for the glasses debacle – dubbing it "wonkygate".</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/itvdebate?src=hashtag_click">#itvdebate</a> . Seems most are hell bent on talking about Jeremy Corbyn’s glasses ? Please let <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wonkygate?src=hashtag_click">#wonkygate</a> be a thing," joked one.</p>
      <p>Writer Sathnam Sanghera asked if it was time that the offending glasses should get their own Twitter account.</p>
