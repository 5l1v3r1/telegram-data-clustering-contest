      <h1>O’Neill defends stop-and-frisk after Bloomberg apology</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:21:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author">Craig McCarthy</a></address>
      <p>Outgoing NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill defended stop-and-frisk as a “constitutionally tested tool” Tuesday — just days after one of the tactic’s biggest boosters, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/bloomberg-apologizes-for-stop-and-frisk-police-policy/">publicly apologized for it</a>.</p>
      <p>“It helps us get weapons off the street, it helps keep the city safe,” the commissioner said in an <a href="https://1010wins.radio.com/articles/news/commissioner-oneill-defends-stop-question-frisk-policy">interview with 1010 WINS’s Juliet Papa</a>. “But it has to be used correctly, and obviously it has to be used constitutionally.”</p>
      <p>The contentious policing tactic, an integral issue in the former mayor’s three-term legacy, eventually led to a civil-rights suit — Floyd v. City of New York.</p>
      <p>The case <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/08/12/nypds-stop-frisk-policy-violated-rights-judge/">ended with a judge ruling that stop-and-frisk</a> led to “indirect racial profiling” and police were using it in an “unconstitutional” manner — leading to the NYPD to significantly scale back on the tactic, going from nearly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/14/stop-and-frisk-numbers-fall-dramatically-under-de-blasio/">700,000 stops at its peak to just over 11,000</a> last year.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that we still employ. We are concentrating on the people driving the crime. It’s a constitutionally-tested tool that has to be used, needs to be used,” O’Neill said in the interview, adding that he respects Bloomberg for taking the stance.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy to apologize,” he said. “If that’s what’s in his heart, and he felt it necessary to do… I think it was a good step for him.”</p>
