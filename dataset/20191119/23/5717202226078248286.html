      <p>Dele Alli has sent a heartfelt message to Mauricio Pochettino on Twitter after Tottenham Hotspur decided to sack the Argentine manager after a poor start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Pochettino’s five-and-a-half-year reign has ended to the frustration and anger of Spurs fans, after chairman Daniel Levy called time on the former Southampton and Espanyol manager’s spell at the club.</p>
      <p>Pochettino earned the love and respect of Spurs fans after turning a top-six club into one that consistently qualified for Champions League football, trusted Spurs’ youth system and took them to the Champions League final just six months ago.</p>
      <p>However, Pochettino has been sacked just 18 months after signing a five-year deal at the end of the 2017-18 season. Alli – who was signed by Spurs for £5million (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31105458">BBC Sport</a>) during Pochettino’s reign – posted on Twitter after Pochettino’s departure.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Is Levy right to call time on Pochettino’s Tottenham spell?</h3>
      <p>The problem at Tottenham right now is that things have gone stale. Pochettino saw his side come within a whisker of winning a trophy and ending the silverware demon – but this season, things seem unable to improve under his stewardship.</p>
      <p>A lack of investment from Levy and the Spurs board, twinned with a bad smell emanating from the Spurs squad and those that want to leave – Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose and more – has seemingly affected performances on the pitch.</p>
      <p>But Pochettino is not blameless. Constant rotation of his side, strange selections – Eriksen continued to be first choice despite his lack of form – and intriguing press conferences where he called out Levy numerous times have ultimately seen him leave.</p>
