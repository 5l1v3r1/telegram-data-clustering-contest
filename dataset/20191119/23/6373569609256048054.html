      <h1>Brexit blamed for 'substantial' downturn at Plymouth factories</h1>
      <h2>Sales and orders are down at manufacturers across the UK, sparking urgent calls from Plymouth business leaders</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:46:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author">Jak Ball</a></address>
      <p>Devon and Plymouth Chamber of Commerce has called on whoever wins the General Election to rapidly sort out the Brexit quagmire and slash red tape as new figures show manufacturers are suffering a dip in sales and orders.</p>
      <p>Stuart Elford, chief executive at Devon and Plymouth Chamber of Commerce said the next Government must address factors causing a “substantial drop” in fortunes for UK factories.</p>
      <p>The South West, and particularly Plymouth, is a manufacturing hot bed, and the Quarterly International Trade Outlook for Q3 2019, released by British Chambers of Commerce and DHL, has revealed manufacturers have struggled in the past three months, with key indicators for orders and cashflow now in negative territory.</p>
      <p>Headline grabbing statistics in the report include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The percentage balance of exporting manufacturers reporting an increase in export orders fell to –1%, down from +9% in the previous quarter.</li>
        <li>The balance of those reporting increased domestic orders fell to -4% in Q3, down from +8% in Q2.</li>
        <li>The balance of exporting manufacturers reporting improved cash flow stood at -5% in Q3, down from +6% in Q2. In Q3 2018, one year ago, the balance stood at +13%.</li>
        <li>In Q3 +8% of exporting service sector firms reported an increase in domestic orders, down from +12% in Q2. A balance of 0% reported an increase in export orders, down from +5%.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mr Elford said: “These results highlight the importance of swift action from the new government to encourage international trade and support businesses in every region of the UK by providing certainty over Brexit and reducing the bureaucracy and hidden costs of doing business.”</p>
      <p>BCC director general Adam Marshall added: “A strong and balanced economy needs healthy exporters at its core.</p>
      <p>“But while there are some companies bucking the trend, future sales and orders are now well into negative territory, after a steady downward trend in export performance this year.</p>
      <p>“Without urgent clarity around our future trading relationship with the EU, firms across the UK will increasingly struggle to fill order books, and jobs and prosperity in many of our communities could be at risk.”</p>
