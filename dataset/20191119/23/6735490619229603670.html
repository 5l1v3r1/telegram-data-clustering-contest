      <p>Cynthia Erivo can be seen playing Harriet Tubman in the new biopic “Harriet”, but it a clueless studio exec had his way the iconic slave-turned-abolitionist would have been portrayed by a famous white actress instead.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.focusfeatures.com/article/interview_screenwriter_gregory-allen-howard">an interview</a> with “Harriet” screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard, he recalls meeting with a studio executive 25 years ago while trying to get the film made, admitting “the climate in Hollywood… was very different” at the time,</p>
      <p>“I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, ‘This script is fantastic. Let’s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman,’” Allen explained.</p>

      <p>“When someone pointed out that Roberts couldn’t be Harriet, the executive responded, ‘It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference.’”</p>
      <p>Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed and Hollywood was spared from the notion of the “Pretty Woman” star playing an African-American icon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he emphasized how much things have changed in recent years when it comes bringing African-American stories to the screen.</p>

      <p>“When ’12 Years a Slave’ became a hit and did a couple hundred million dollars worldwide, I told my agent, ‘You can’t say this kind of story won’t make money now,'” he added. “Then Black Panther really blew the doors open.”</p>
