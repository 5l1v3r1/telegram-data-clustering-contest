      <h1>Soccer Mommy Unveils Short Film for New Track "yellow is the color of her eyes"</h1>
      <h2>Directed by Alex Ross Perry.</h2>

      <p>Back in September, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/soccer-mommy">Soccer Mommy</a> delivered her first new, original solo record since the release of her 2018 debut album <i>Clean, </i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/soccer-mommy-lucy-single-stream">“Lucy.”</a> Now, for that track’s follow-up, the fast-rising musician is back with another new single, “yellow is the color of her eyes.” Besides Soccer Mommy’s contributions, “yellow is the color of her eyes” also features Mary Lattimore on harp. Further supporting and promoting her latest song, Soccer Mommy is also linking up with director Alex Ross Perry for an accompanying short film.</p>
      <p>“‘yellow is the color of her eyes’ is a song that is really important to me,” Soccer Mommy shares via an official press statement. “The song was inspired by a time when I was on the road constantly and I felt like I was losing time – specifically with my mother. It’s also a song that I feel really showcases my writing when it comes to instrumentation, so it’s one that makes me really proud.”</p>
      <p>“The challenge of creating a 7-minute piece was daunting and irresistible in equal measure. Having just completed a film for which the color-coded design of it’s various acts was of the utmost importance, Sophie’s idea of collaborating on a short-form film to compliment her similarly-conceived new music was irresistible,” director Alex Ross Perry adds via an additional set of quotes. “Running with her idea of locations evoking where she wrote this song, the concept couldn’t have announced itself more boldly. To that, I shared images from Breaking the Waves and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It wasn’t until we got the footage back that I realized a dash of first-scene-of-Inception had snuck in there, as well.”</p>
