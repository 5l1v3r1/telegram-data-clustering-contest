      <h1>‘A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood’ review: Hanks was born to play Mr. Rogers</h1>

      <p>If you were raised on Mister Rogers, you may find your tear ducts a little wobbly at the first delicate piano notes of the opening credits of “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”</p>
      <p>Director Marielle Heller (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?”) jumps right into a strikingly accurate re-creation of the song and sequence that began every episode of the Pittsburgh-based children’s show “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” with Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks) coming in the front door, switching out his sport jacket for a cardigan and jauntily changing into his house Keds.</p>
      <p>But this is no straightforward biopic, and that’s to this film’s advantage. First of all, just last year saw a terrific documentary about Rogers, and secondly, it’s the rare biopic that doesn’t wander into predictability.</p>
      <p>This screenplay, by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, is sourced from an Esquire magazine piece by Tom Junod; it becomes a running juxtaposition between Rogers, the beatific but somewhat inscrutable American icon, and Matthew Rhys’ investigative-journalist character Lloyd Vogel, a cynic who chafes at what he sees as a sappy assignment to profile him.</p>
      <p>Some may be disappointed the film isn’t completely Rogers-centric, but I think less may be even better. Make no mistake: Hanks was born to play this role. He’s not channeling Rogers, exactly, but he has a firm grasp on the unflappable, generous sincerity that was the TV host’s trademark. Add in the underlying fact that Hanks is already one of our most beloved actors, and you have an alchemical reaction for the ages. (That said, every so often a teensy bit of Forrest Gump does creep into his Pittsburgh twang.)</p>
      <p>Heller’s movie functions as a sort of debate between modern takedown culture and Rogers’ steadfast beliefs. No matter how many times Rhys’ character asks what’s going on underneath the nice-guy surface, or who the “real” man is apart from the show, Rogers patiently explains his mission is to help people — children, primarily, but clearly also the guy interviewing him — learn to deal with difficult feelings. And that talking about them makes them manageable.</p>
      <p>Lloyd, harboring long-simmering resentment for his absentee father (Chris Cooper), wears emotional armor that proves difficult for Rogers to pierce — a challenge he apparently relished. “He likes everyone, but he loves people like you,” Rogers’ producer (Enrico Colantoni) tells Lloyd. After watching a New York subway car full of people spontaneously serenade the host with his own theme song, you know Lloyd is a goner. He even makes a fantasy-sequence foray into the Land of Make-Believe, with his wife (Susan Kelechi Watson) playing the role of the princess Lady Aberlin.</p>
      <p>Heller tips a hat to Rogers’ unique show format, with location-setting scenes composed of tiny model landscapes. And it’s amusing to meet Rogers’ staff, an adoring but exhausted group who constantly rearrange the day’s lineup to accommodate his daily meetings with excited young fans. The film also acknowledges Rogers wasn’t perfect, and that he found his own ways of releasing the stress of being so many people’s de facto saint, including piano-playing: He kept one on set, at least in this telling.</p>
      <p>I’m sure there are some viewers who will find all of this so sweet it makes their teeth hurt, and I feel bad for them. The real-life Esquire cover story that eventually ran was titled “Can You Say . . . ‘Hero’?,” and there isn’t a better one to be found than Rogers. Hanks’ all-in portrayal ought to snag him an Oscar nomination, and ideally also inspire a little more kindness in all of us.</p>
