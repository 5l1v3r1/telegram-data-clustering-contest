      <p>AR-AB has been found guilty of using his O.B.H. Records imprint as a front to pump massive amounts of drugs around Philadelphia.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Philadelphia rapper AR-AB and three of his associates were convicted today (November 19) for running a large-scale drug operation in the city.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/feds-accuse-philly-rapper-ar-ab-of-being-a-king-pin-moving-major-weight-g5wrAXIIo0aoSIE205NZfw/">In October of 2018, the Feds accused AR-AB of using his “Original Block Hustlaz" record label as a front to import at least 10 kilos of cocaine from California, which were distributed around Philly.</a>
      </p>
      <p>AR-AB and Jamaal “Bionickhaz” Blanding, Jameel “Meliano” Hickson and Hans "NoBrakes Bras" Gadson made money from distributing cocaine, crack cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/rumors/we-know-how-the-feds-caught-ar-ab-xJoEfqtxy02uCy-8afQ1-Q/">The rapper, aka "Philly's Top Goon" and his O.B.H. associates became the subject of a federal investigation beginning in March of 2017.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The Fed's say AR-AB born Abdul West, fronted the money for the drugs and ordered other O.B.H. members to commit acts of murder and violence.</p>
      <p>Undercover agents say they purchased drugs from various O.B.H. affiliates during multiple covert sting operations.</p>
      <p>Investigators eventually seized drugs in bulk and over $28,000 in cash during raids on four properties the gang controlled.</p>
      <p>“West [AR-AB] and his co-defendants, members of the O.B.H. drug organization, pumped huge quantities of deadly drugs into our community while pretending to be legitimate artists and businessmen,” said United States Attorney William M. McSwain. “Drug trafficking is an inherently dangerous business, and drug traffickers ultimately deliver violence and destruction to our communities without any regard for the people living there. Our Office is determined to do exactly what we did in this case: investigate and convict these dangerous criminals and put them in prison.”</p>
      <p>Now, each one of the defendants is facing a possible life sentence and being convicted of conspiracy to distribute drugs and other drug trafficking crimes.</p>
