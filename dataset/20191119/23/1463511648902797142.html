      <p>Belgian champion Genk have hired German coach Hannes Wolf in a bid to overturn a poor run of results that has left the club languishing at mid-table in the Belgian league and out of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Genk said in a statement on Tuesday that the 38-year-old Wolf, who guided Stuttgart to promotion in Germany two years ago and went on to coach Hamburger SV, joined the club alongside his regular assistant Miguel Moreira.</p>
      <p>Wolf was tutored by Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp when he was in charge of the youth teams at Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>He replaced Felice Mazzu, who was fired this month after Genk lost at Salzburg 6-2 and was beaten twice by Liverpool in recent weeks in the Champions League. Genk is bottom of its group and can no longer reach the knockout phase.</p>
