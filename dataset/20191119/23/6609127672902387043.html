        <b>ELECTION telly debates almost always give off more heat than light.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And there was no change tonight as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn squared up for the first head-to-head.</p>

      <p>For all the hype about who won or who messed up, it’s unlikely the debate will change the minds of many voters.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4973862/boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-itv-election-debate-jam/">Watching the pair slug it out</a> would have been an especially odd spectacle for many Scottish voters, with no place for Nicola Sturgeon, despite the SNP being streets ahead north of the border.</p>
      <p>It also looks unlikely Mr Johnson will debate the First Minister any time soon.</p>
      <p>Despite his bluster about the First Minister not standing as PM, it’s hard to conclude he’s not utterly terrified of being eaten alive by Ms Sturgeon.</p>
      <p>The alternative TV battle was on the other channel, of course, as Scotland took on Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But Johnson v Corbyn was enough to make a meaningless Euro qualifier at chilly Hampden look like the World Cup Final.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Greens goof</h3>
      <p>
        <b>THE Greens and SNP are locked in a perpetual battle at Holyrood over who’s the most “progressive”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In terms of tax, this vacuous buzzword means one thing — clobbering the wealthy as hard as possible.</p>
      <p>Well, there’s bad news for the SNP.</p>
      <p>It looks like the Greens might have won.</p>
      <p>Their proposal for a rates overhaul, set down in a parliamentary amendment, would lead to — quite literally — astronomical bills for big businesses.</p>
      <p>The Greens now insist <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4973091/green-party-tax-charges-trillions-primark-marks-and-spencer/">their plans were an error</a>. Quite how they made this mistake is a mystery, given the step-by-step calculation was carefully spelled out in legislative format.</p>
      <p>On one hand, the bungle is funny. Until you remember the Greens have the minority SNP Government under the thumb.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Come Budget time it will be the Greens — complete with their crackpot calculations — who have the whip hand over the Nats.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Bleak diagnosis</h3>
      <p>
        <b>FIGURES out yesterday for A&amp;E waiting times do not bode well.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The number of Scots spending more than 12 hours in accident and emergency is up, while overall performance against the four-hour aim is at its <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4973978/scottish-hospitals-patient-wait-times-longer/">worst since March 2018</a>.</p>
      <p>At the troubled Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, almost a third of patients spent longer than the target time in the emergency department.</p>
      <p>As ever, the SNP will seek to claim performance is better than in other parts of the UK.</p>
      <p>But these are targets set by Nats ministers, and they are meant to be achievable. It looks like we’re in for a long winter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And ministers will not be forgiven if our hospitals are unprepared.</b>
