      <h1>Diablo 4 will let you customise your skill slots</h1>

        <b>Diablo 3 launched – controversially – with locked skill slots for each type of ability. Primary skills would exclusively be on left click, and other slots were similarly locked to specific buttons. While the mix-and-match elective mode was eventually patched into Diablo 3, based on the BlizzCon demo it seemed that Diablo 4 would return to locked skill slots.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But now, the developers have confirmed that Diablo 4 “will support elective mode-style skill selection. Skill selection and assignment will always be completely open for all players.” That’s from a new <a href="https://us.diablo3.com/en/blog/23232022/system-design-in-diablo-iv-part-i-11-19-2019?linkId=100000009101777">blog post</a> detailing how community feedback is already shaping Diablo 4, which is “still very much in active development.”</p>
      <p>Some features are still completely up in the air, including <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/diablo-4/endgame">endgame</a> progression. The developers have yet to decide whether high-end progression will be finite or infinite, and we might see a level cap combined with a second experience system that would “capture the fun of achieving those really difficult endgame goals and ranks.”</p>
      <p>Ancient items are also getting some attention after the BlizzCon feedback. “Ancients as they are don’t really serve a clear purpose in Diablo IV. We should have done a better job of explaining the role of Ancient Items in Diablo IV. We had a preliminary direction to share, but you’ve brought up some great points, so we’re revisiting our designs with your feedback in mind.”</p>
      <p>We’ll see more details on itemisation in a future blog post, so it seems that Blizzard plans to keep up regular communication with fans in this format. That, at least, should make the wait for the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/diablo-4/release-date">Diablo 4 release date</a> a little bit more bearable.</p>
