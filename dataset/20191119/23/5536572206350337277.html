      <h1>Jerry Jones Speaks On Missed Opportunity To Hire Bill Belichick As Cowboys Head Coach</h1>

      <p>Over the past 23 years, 9 months, and 22 days, the Dallas Cowboys have failed to get to the NFC Title game, and most importantly, the Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had an opportunity to not have that happened for so long when he was presented the chance of hiring Bill Belichick before he became the Belichick we know today.</p>
      <p>Appearing on 105.3 The Fan, Jones explained the one-off chance to hire Belichick following his 1995 firing as the Cleveland Browns’ head coach. That decision would change the course of 3 different franchises for years to come.</p>
      <p>According to Jon Machota of The Athletic:</p>
      <blockquote>“There was a moment at ski lodge back in the mid-90s where Belichick and Jones ran into each other. The future head coach of the New England Patriots had just been fired by the Cleveland Browns and was looking for his next opportunity. He told Jones to keep him in mind if there was even an opportunity for him with the Cowboys.<br/><br/>“I’ve thought about that many times,” Jones said. “You never know where you can find a great coach. You can find them in a ski checkout line sometimes.”</blockquote>

      <p>Belichick spent five years with the Browns and was dismissed after compiling a record of 36-44. He would go on to join the Patriots as an assistant under Bill Parcells in 1996 before Parcells would bolt to sign with the New York Jets.</p>
      <p>In 2000, Belichick was hired by the Patriots and given control of the roster. The rest is history as he has since rolled in 234 wins, six Super Bowl titles, and three AP NFL Coach of the Year awards.</p>
