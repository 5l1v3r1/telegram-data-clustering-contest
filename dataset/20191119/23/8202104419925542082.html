      <h3>A 19-year-old woman is dead after a two-vehicle highway collision near Wakaw.</h3>
      <p>RCMP responded Monday around 9:15 a.m. after a report of a crash two kilometres north of Wakaw on Highway 2.</p>
      <p>According to a police news release, the 19-year-old woman was the lone occupant of a southbound car that collided with a northbound SUV. She was pronounced dead at the scene. A 58-year-old man driving the SUV was transported by emergency crews to hospital for what were believed to be serious injuries, RCMP said. A girl in the SUV was not injured.</p>
      <p>RCMP said the cause of the collision was not immediately determined, but that alcohol is not believed to be a factor. RCMP said road conditions were wet and visibility was clear at the time of the crash.</p>
