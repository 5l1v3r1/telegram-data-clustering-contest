      <h1>Busy parents, here is how you can spend more quality time with your kids</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>As parents of small kids, there is a very thin line between worrying about not spending enough time with your little one to thinking that they will stay this little forever (or at least for a little longer). However, time flies and before you know, your adorable toddlers--who could not have enough of you-- have turned into angsty teens who do not really want to step out of their rooms.</p>
      <p>Believe us when we say that they do grow up pretty quickly and time passes in the blink of an eye. Each day with your little one brings a new set of milestones, challenges and most of all a new opportunity to make lasting memories.</p>
      <p>It does not matter whether you are a stay-at-home parent or a working parent, the guilt of not being able to give undivided attention to your kids can be really taxing. Hence, it is important to understand that no matter how hard you try, you wonâ€™t be able to be there for every milestone your baby achieves. We tell you three simple ways you can squeeze in maximum time with your little one on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1.The walk to the grocery store</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before you roll your eyes, hear us out. Taking your kids to the grocery store (when you are not running short of time) can help them feel involved in the whole process of understanding where the food on their plate comes from.</p>
      <p>In case your kids decide to pick processed food in fancy packaging, you can also explain to them that most unhealthy food items come in attractive packaging. Making the shopping list, selecting the ingredients and going from aisle to aisle can be a unique bonding experience with your kids.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Dinner time is family time</b>
      </p>
      <p>Make it a point to sit down and have a meal with the kids, at least once a day. It can be the last meal of the day when you come back from work and the kids are also done with their homework. Give them your undivided time and attention as you touch upon everything that is happening in your kiddos' life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Cooking together</b>
      </p>
      <p>Involving your children in the preparation of the family meal can be a great bonding experience. Not only it is a beautiful way to pass down family recipes and culinary heritage, but it can also help kids feel more invested and included. However, make it point to give them clear instructions about what items they can touch and what they should steer clear from. It is also a good idea to have another adult keep an eye on the junior chef.</p>
