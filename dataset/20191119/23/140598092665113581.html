      <h1>Tianna Bartoletta criticises own sponsor Nike over response to Mary Cain's Alberto Salazar 'abuse' claims</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:37:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-morgan/" target="_blank">Tom Morgan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/08/16/tianna-bartoletta-becoming-anaemic-menstruation-completely-changing/">Tianna Bartoletta</a>, the reigning Olympic long jump champion, has attacked her own sponsor, Nike, over the brand's response to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/11/08/nike-investigate-alberto-salazar-claims-emotional-physical-abuse/">Mary Cain alleging she suffered “emotional and physical abuse”</a> under Alberto Salazar.</p>
      <p>Writing on her blog, Bartoletta also criticised the partial apology to Cain from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/10/01/sir-mo-farahs-former-coach-alberto-salazar-banned-four-years/">disgraced coach Salazar,</a> adding "it hasn’t been a good media year for my main sponsor".</p>
      <p>"I applaud Mary for 'getting out' even if for a moment she wanted back in," Bartoletta wrote, citing global headlines at the start of the month when Cain described Salazar's constant demands for her to get her weight down to 8st 2lb.</p>
      <p>Bartoletta, 34, compared the scrutiny Cain had faced to her own experience of going through the divorce courts. She added: "Alberto apologises but not really because his apology featured the words 'if' and 'maybe'. But I expected that from him. What I didn’t expect to see in the published statement was the seemingly harmless line about Mary Cain wanting to return to the Oregon Project and how she didn’t raise any of those concerns when she was looking to return."</p>
      <p>Bartoletta described the statement as "f***** up to include... because that line was essentially an attempt to cast doubt on and discredit Mary’s story". "That line was included as if to say, 'if it was as bad as you say why did you want back in?'," she added.</p>

      <p>Including Nike in her criticism, she wrote on tiannabee.com: "That line released in the statement by Nike, ignores how abuse and its victims operate. It ignores the fact that not only do abuse victims often stay with their abusers, it also ignores the phenomena that some victims return after leaving."</p>
      <p>American Cain, who joined Salazar as a 16-year-old, had said she had stopped menstruating for three years, broke five bones because of osteoporosis, and began to feel suicidal as a result.</p>
      <p>After she alleged physical and emotional abuse, Salazar and Nike released statements saying Cain had not raised such issues before and was even interested in returning earlier this year. Cain responded, acknowledging that she had still believed she could improve her relationship with Salazar. Nike stressed that Cain’s allegations were new and the company pledged to delve further into them.</p>
      <p>“These are deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before,” Nike said in a statement. “Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto’s team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process. We take the allegations extremely seriously and will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes. At Nike we seek to always put the athlete at the center of everything we do, and these allegations are completely inconsistent with our values.”</p>
      <p>Salazar, in a statement to The Oregonian, said Cain’s father, a medical doctor, had been continually informed on Cain’s health regimens. He also reiterated his claim that, despite his four-year ban by the US Anti-Doping Agency, he has never asked an athlete to take a banned substance.</p>
      <p>The coach, who is appealing the ban, insisted that he provided his athletes with resources such as “dietitians, nutritionists and others, to help them achieve or maintain any training weight or performance weight in a healthy and appropriate manner”.</p>
