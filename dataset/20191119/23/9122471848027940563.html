      <h1>NFL Insider Reveals Latest On Antonio Brown’s Potential Return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:22:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday morning, former New England Patriots star wide receiver <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/antonio-brown-message-robert-kraft-sexual-assault-allegations-future-new-england-patriots">Antonio Brown made headlines for what he posted on social media</a>.</p>
      <p>Instead of inciting controversy, his comments had the opposite effect. Brown apologized to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the organization for the negative news he brought during his one-week stint with the team.</p>
      <p>“Mr.Kraft I apologize sincerely to you and your organization! All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama! Thank you sincerely, AB,” Brown wrote.</p>
      <p>His comments sparked a conversation regarding when he could return to the league. According to a report from <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/19/antonio-brown-is-hoping-for-a-decision-very-soon/">Pro Football Talk</a>, Brown expects to know his fate “very soon.”</p>
      <p>From the report:</p>
      <blockquote>Per a source with knowledge of the situation, Brown remains hopeful that a decision will come “very soon.” There’s a sense of optimism from Brown’s perspective that he will be cleared to return to the NFL before the 2019 regular season ends.</blockquote>
      <p>Brown was released by the Oakland Raiders and then the Patriots after allegations of sexual assault surfaced.</p>
      <p>He reportedly met with the NFL last week to present his side of the story.</p>
      <p>Will Brown return to the league this season? Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
