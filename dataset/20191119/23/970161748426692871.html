      <p>BTS have asked their fans ARMY to be patient while they work hard on their new music.</p>
      <p>RM, Suga, V, Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope and Jimin are already cooking something up together after their Love Yourself: Speak Yourself tour came to an end.</p>
      <p>While their huge fanbase will want them to rest, the K-Pop stars have been busy working on their comeback.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-bts-2641354203.html?rebelltitem=57#rebelltitem57">In an interview with Paper magazine</a>, the group revealed: ‘We are currently practicing and working on new songs so we can show you the best sides of ourselves. Please look forward to it.’</p>
      <p>We are, don’t worry about that!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile rapper RM confessed that he does feel ‘pressure’ to maintain an image for their followers, but his fellow member Suga added that ‘pressure is also one part of life’.</p>
      <p>J-Hope added: ‘I can’t say we don’t [feel pressure]. These days, I feel like I live with a sense of mission.</p>

      <p>‘Rather than thinking, “It has to be perfect!,” I do what I have to do, making sure I remember the really important and fundamental things and trust that the results will follow.’</p>

      <p>‘We will hurry and come back with a new album soon. It will be really soon,’ he told the crowd, according to Yonhap.</p>
      <p>The star continued: ‘While I performed Epiphany, I was saddened at thinking that this might be the last time I’d sing it. ‘Thinking that “It’s the end”, it was bittersweet.’</p>
