      <p>One year ago today, Conor McGregor launched Proper No. 12 whiskey worldwide as part of his <a href="https://augustmcgregor.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAws7uBRAkEiwAMlbZjjAG1SZhEgwuvXY3GkR-s55XHmkNKxPHbysYVbbXBD_Eh3cWLL0IIxoCCAcQAvD_BwE">ever-growing empire</a> that has made him rich beyond his wildest dreams. While initially received with <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/6/3/17422264/tennessee-conor-mcgregor-just-trashed-your-whiskey">mixed reviews</a>, McGregor’s whiskey has proven to be a <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/10/12/17968082/conor-mcgregors-whiskey-proper-no-12-sets-sales-buy-records-despite-abysmal-reviews-mma">financial success</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, McGregor is celebrating the one-year anniversary of his brain child by not only belting out a tune while holding a cake and a bottle of his product, but by donating $1 million of the profits to first responders.</p>
      <p>“Happy 1st birthday to @properwhiskey!!! What a journey it has been so far! We are now in 8 countries to date, with many more planned for 2020! I am so thankful to you all for your support and love of PROPER No. TWELVE,” wrote Conor on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DYvaIp6lV/?igshid=5gzpbjyot47z">Instagram.</a></p>
      <p>“I also want to thank the fine Irish women and men who have worked so diligently at the distillery and beyond … what an amazing team we have. When we started this business, something very important to me was to give back,” he added.</p>
      <p>“For every case we sell, my company donates $5 up to 1 million dollars per year to first responders. I am very proud to announce that we have already hit the 1 million dollar mark! This is all thanks to you! Our fans! Thank you all.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, “Notorious” revealed that his efforts have now reached the $1 million mark and come 2020, he will be sending out the funds to first responder organizations.</p>
      <p>“In the New Year, we will begin donating the first million dollars to first responder organizations. My team is vetting it all out now to be sure it goes into the proper hands. Thank you all for the support!”</p>
      <p>What a move.</p>
      <p>McGregor is in talks to <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/24/20930208/conor-mcgregor-ufc-comeback-fight-booked-jan-18-las-vegas-mma">make his much-anticipated return</a> to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Octagon at the beginning of the new year, possibly against Donald Cerrone at UFC 246 on Jan. 18, 2020.</p>
      <p>In addition, McGregor vows to be much busier in 2020 inside the Octagon, vowing to once again recapture UFC gold. Regardless if he gets there or not, he will be a major winner in the eyes and hearts of first responders around the world thanks to his kind gesture.</p>
