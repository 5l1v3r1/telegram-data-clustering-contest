      <p>MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Tuesday there were questions to be answered after a televised interview in which Prince Andrew denied accusations he had sex with a teenage girl.</p>
      <p>Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, has faced a backlash for his explanation of his relationship with late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein and a denial of ever having sex with one of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre.</p>
      <p>Speaking publicly for the first time about his relationship with Epstein, who killed himself in August while being held on federal sex-trafficking charges, he gave an at times rambling and contradictory account.</p>
      <p>Since the interview with the BBC aired on Saturday night, it has overshadowed Britain’s election campaign.</p>
      <p>Asked during a televised election leadership debate with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday whether the monarchy was fit for purpose, Corbyn said: “It needs a bit of improvement.”</p>
      <p>When the presenter followed up by asking whether Prince Andrew was fit for purpose, Corbyn said: “There are very, very serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law.”</p>
      <p>In response to the same questions, Johnson said “the institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach”.</p>
      <p>“All our sympathies should be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and the law must certainly take its course,” he added.</p>
