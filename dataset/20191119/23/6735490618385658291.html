      <h1>‘The Bachelor’: Nick Viall Responds To Vanessa Grimaldi’s Confession That She Never Wanted To Get Engaged</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:43:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>During a recent conversation on the Taylor Nolan-hosted podcast <a href="http://letstalkaboutitwithtaylornolan.libsyn.com/">“Let’s Talk About It”</a>, “Bachelor” beauty Vanessa Grimaldi confessed that she really didn’t really want to say yes to Nick Viall’s proposal at the end of their season.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to get engaged. They didn’t air this,” said the Montreal-born Grimaldi. “I had a conversation with him, and I said, ‘Listen, wouldn’t it be better if we just date outside of the show and then get engaged? Because that’d be more meaningful. We’d get to know each other.’“</p>
      <p>As she recalled, “He said, ‘I know to you it could be just a piece of jewelry, but there’s so much meaning towards us leaving engaged because there’s going to be so much attention.’  There’s going to be so much backlash on us once we’re done with the show. At least this is going to hold us so much more. It’s going to hold us together. It’s going to hold us together more than it’s true. ‘Cause you have, like, something you’re working towards, right?’”</p>

      <p>Viall had the opportunity to respond to Grimaldi’s revelation when he appeared on fellow Bachelor Nation alum Kaitlyn Bristowe’s <a href="http://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/A87VCJ616Whqwr90LhVlTFG?domain=icm-tracking.meltwater.com">“Off the Vine”</a> podcast, where he was asked point-blank about her comments during a game of “Truth or Drink”.</p>
      <p>“Vanessa has spoken out — pretty recently — about not wanting to get engaged on the show. How did you feel about her talking about this publicly?” Bristowe asked.</p>
      <p>“So, the question is, what do I think about it? Or not, whether it was true?” he responded</p>
      <p>“Yeah, what do you think about it?” Bristowe said.</p>

      <p>“Uh, I mean, it was fine. Right? I mean, like, was I irritated?” Viall said.</p>
      <p>After Bristowe joked that Viall’s reaction “to everything” is “it was fine,” he responded, “Well, you try to be level-headed.”</p>
