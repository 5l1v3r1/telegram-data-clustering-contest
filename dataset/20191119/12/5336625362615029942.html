      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Renewed <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdwr">Apple iPhones</a> are on sale on Amazon, saving you up to 15% on list price. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>There are many different accepted tactics when it comes to getting a good deal on <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdwr">Apple iPhones</a>, with savvy shoppers capitalising on pre-orders, generous contracts, and free gift promotions. All of these are strong strategies, but nothing compares to going renewed.</p>
      <p>You can get some of the latest models at really low prices if you opt for a renewed device, and despite what you may think, you won't end up with a damaged or faulty product.</p>
      <p>Renewed products work and look like new, and have been inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified suppliers. Batteries have at least 80% capacity relative to new, and wireless devices come with the one-year Amazon Renewed Guarantee. This means your product is eligible for a replacement or refund within one year of receipt if it does not work as expected. </p>
      <p>You can now save on a wide range of <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdwr">Apple iPhone XS</a> and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdwr">XS Max</a> models on Amazon as part of the retailer's "Countdown to Black Friday Sale." These deals will expire at midnight on Nov. 19, or when stocks run out. </p>
      <p>These deals won't be around for long, so you'll need to act fast to avoid disappointment.</p>
