      <p><b>JERUSALEM -</b> Israel's air defenses intercepted four rockets fired from neighboring Syria on Tuesday, the army said, prompting reported retaliatory missile strikes against the source of the fire.<br/><br/>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rockets were fired from positions around the capital held by groups loyal to the Damascus government.<br/><br/>It did not elaborate on which group had launched the rockets or whether there had been any casualties in the retaliatory strikes.<br/><br/>The flareup comes after a major escalation in and around Gaza last week following Israel's targeted killing of a commander of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Damascus.<br/><br/>The killing was accompanied by a second strike, unconfirmed by Israel, on an Islamic Jihad leader in Damascus that killed his son and another person.<br/><br/>There was no immediate rocket fire from Syria following that strike.<br/><br/>"Four launches were identified from Syria towards Israeli territory which were intercepted by the Israeli air defense systems," the Israeli military said in a statement.<br/><br/>"No hits on Israeli communities were identified."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, blasts were heard close to the airport in the Syrian capital Damascus, the state SANA news agency reported.<br/><br/>It gave no further details but the Observatory reported "missile fire by Israeli aircraft on positions south and southwest of Damascus".<br/><br/>Syrian air defenses opened fire in response, the Britain-based war monitor said.<br/><br/>"The Israeli bombardment targeted positions held by pro-regime groups who launched the missiles against Israel," Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. -AFP</p>
