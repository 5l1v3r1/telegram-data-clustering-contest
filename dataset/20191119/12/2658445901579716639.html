        <b>Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The victory secured last week by the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa state, Chief David Lyon, has been ascribed to the gradual acceptance of the party by the people of the South-South.</p>
      <p>The National Organising Secretary of the APC, Barr Emma Ibediro, who stated this in a chat with The Nation in Abuja on Tuesday, also ascribed the victory of the Kogi State governor, Mr. Yahaya Bello, to the fact that the party had come to stay in the North-Central region of the country.</p>
      <p>Ibediro, who noted that the task before Lyon, prior to the election, was herculean, having to face a candidate being sponsored by an incumbent governor, in a party that has ruled the state for twenty years, but noted that the APC candidate’s reach with the electorate in the state was an asset that could not be overlooked.</p>
      <p>He also highlighted the governance style of the outgoing ruling party in the state, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), which he said had failed to do anything meaningful to change the outlook of the state, despite the huge resources accruing to the coffers of the state, as another reason that made the APC look more attractive to the people.</p>
      <p>He, however, expressed the hope that the two governors-elect would use the opportunities that their respective people had given them to strengthen the faith that Nigerians across the country have started reposing in President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration by delivering their best to meet the people’s needs.</p>

      <p>“I want to thank God for the victory He has given to the party in Bayelsa and Kogi States. This victory is a demonstration of the acceptance of the All Progressives Congress in the South-South of Nigeria and also a reconfirmation that in the North-Central, APC is a party to beat. I want to thank the people of Kogi and Bayelsa States for the confidence they have in our party.</p>
      <p>“It is not easy to beat an incumbent in a state like Bayelsa that has been under the PDP for the past 20 years, but when you present a good man as a candidate, a man who is at home with his people, there’s no way people can forsake such a man, especially when they are confronted with a very incompetent government that has been ruling the state for the past eight years.</p>
      <p>“Bayelsa is a small state, one of those with the smallest number of local government areas and one of the state with very huge income coming from the federal government, due to their location, but upon a visit to Yenagoa, which is about the only land local government, the others ones are basically water, you cannot see the effect of the large amount of resources that go into Bayelsa state. The victory, for Bayelsa people, is liberation.</p>
      <p>“In Kogi, I want to thank the people for reconfirming their choice for the APC. A lot of things were said about Bello, but all I can see, these were propaganda for outside the state, the actual owners of Kogi have said who they want. It’s also another opportunity for him to correct the wrongs, if any, which people accused him of.</p>
      <p>“I want to congratulate both governors-elect on this very important victory for their states and for our party and hope that by their actions, they will renew the trust Nigerians are beginning to have in the progressive government of President Muhammadu Buhari,” he said.</p>
