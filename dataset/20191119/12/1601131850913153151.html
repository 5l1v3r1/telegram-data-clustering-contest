      <h1>Daily Deal: 13% off Samsung Wireless Charging Dock for Galaxy/Gear smartwatches</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:47:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">SM Picks</a></address>
      <p>We have brought you plenty of deals on smartwatches, but what about those cute little wireless charging cradles that you require to charge those smartwatches? As with every mobile device, you get only one charger in the box when you buy a smartwatch, and you can’t really plug them into any charger with a USB cable like you can plug in a smartphone. That means it can be handy to have an extra charger for your watch so you don’t have to carry a single charger everywhere, and if you’re looking to pick up an additional charger, there’s a 13% discount on Samsung’s wireless charging dock that should interest you.</p>
      <p>This dock can charge any Samsung smartwatch, including the Galaxy Watch, Gear S3, Gear Sport, Galaxy Watch Active, and Galaxy Watch Active 2. It’s an official accessory and is, therefore, safe to use. Go ahead and hit the <i>Buy Now </i>button to get one for yourself before the deal expires.</p>
