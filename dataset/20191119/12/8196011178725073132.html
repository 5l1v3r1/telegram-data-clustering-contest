      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stood by his Wexford by-election candidate Verona Murphy even though he admits her remarks about migrants were “wrong" and "misinformed”.</p>
      <p>Pressed by the <i>Irish Examiner</i> this afternoon, while launching the national broadband plan in Wicklow, Mr Varadkar said he still had "confidence" in Ms Murphy and would campaign for her.</p>
      <p>Ms Murphy has caused public outrage, after claiming that some asylum seekers coming to Ireland have to be “de-programmed” and they may have been infiltrated by the terrorist group ISIS.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Wicklow, Mr Varadkar said:</p>
      <blockquote>Verona is a very outspoken, a very independent person. She's not going to be the kind of person who toes the party line.</blockquote>
      <p>“I think on some occasions, she has got it absolutely wrong. But she is the selected candidate. And I will certainly be campaigning with her before polling day.</p>
      <p>“In relation to her comments that she made the other day. I talked about them to her yesterday. They were misinformed. They were ill-advised. They were wrong and she was right to apologise for them.”</p>
      <p>Ms Murphy has since said the comments were a poor choice of words. Nonetheless, in today's <i>Wexford People</i>, Ms Murphy is quoted further as claiming that ISIS has influenced children as young as three. She is also quoted as criticising drink-driving laws which she said had targeted “Irish” motorists.</p>
      <p>Mr Varadkar told the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, when pressed, that he did still have “confidence” in the Fine Gael election candidate.</p>
      <p>He also told the press conference:</p>
      <blockquote>There are hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland who are migrants, that contribute to our economy to our society to our public services. A very small number of come from Iraq and Syria.</blockquote>
