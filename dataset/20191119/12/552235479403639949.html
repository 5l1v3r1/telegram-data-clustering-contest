      <p>Now a 32 and 38-year-old have appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court in relation to the matter.</p>
      <p>Brian Kelly and Derek Gallagher, both East Kilbride, made no plea or declaration at court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Both are charged with assault to severe injury, but only Mr Kelly was released on bail.</p>
      <p>Mr Gallagher was remanded in custody following his court appearance.</p>
      <p>It is expected the pair will return to court in the next eight days.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Lex Baillie told the News the pair had been arrested following a public appeal for information and thanked those who came forward to help police with their investigation.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith, who served with the Royal Marines during the height of the troubles in Northern Ireland, was said to have suffered a bleed on the brain, cracked ribs and bruised kidneys following the alleged attack.</p>
      <p>Following the publicity over the alleged incident, he is now being helped by the South Lanarkshire Council’s  veterans’ support liaison.</p>
