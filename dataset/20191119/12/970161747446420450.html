      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emre-can/">Emre Can</a> has admitted he is unhappy at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/juventus/">Juventus</a> as the midfielder struggles to nail down a place in Maurizio Sarri’s side.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liverpool-fc/">Liverpool</a> star has managed just four appearances this season for Juventus and suffered a sizable snub when he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/04/ex-liverpool-midfielder-emre-can-shocked-angry-juventus-champions-league-snub-10683408/">omitted completely from their Champions League squad</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are reportedly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/emre-can-keen-manchester-united-move-contact-made-entourage-10933026/">interested in bringing Can back to England</a> and the 25-year-old has now opened up about his current frustrations.</p>
      <p>‘I’m just an ambitious guy who always wants to compete at the highest level,’ he told Kicker.</p>

      <p>‘But I’m also learning from this tough time when things are not going the way I was hoping.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not playing games from the start, so I’m not happy, but I will stay strong and keep working on myself.</p>

      <p>‘I’m often in the gym before or after training doing extra shifts. I want to be ready.’</p>
      <p>The winter transfer window is fast approaching and United are expected to do some business in January.</p>
      <p>Can has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford as well as his Juventus team-mate, Mario Mandzukic, who is equally unsettled in Italy.</p>
      <p>United are in need of another forward and Mandzukic is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/mario-mandzukic-asks-join-manchester-united-january-transfer-window-opens-11125820/">pushing for Juventus to agree a deal with the Red Devils</a>.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old is not expected to come with a big transfer fee, but Juventus reportedly value Can at around £35million.</p>
