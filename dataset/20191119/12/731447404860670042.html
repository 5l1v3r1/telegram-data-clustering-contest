      <p><a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/varg">Varg2™</a> is releasing an EP on <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=9633">Northern Electronics</a>. <br/><br/>The five-track <i>Fuck Varg</i> references the Swedish artist's name change following a cease and desist claim by a German metal band earlier this year. While it's his first solo EP as Varg2™, he's released <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/70740">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/70938">tracks</a> under the moniker in recent months. <br/><br/>The new EP was recorded in Copenhagen, Kyiv and Tbilisi this year, and also includes a remix by Polish producer <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/vtss">VTSS</a> on the digital version. It will be available on vinyl and digital formats from December 12th. <br/><br/><i>Fuck Varg</i> is Varg2™'s third release on Anthony Linell's Northern Electronics this year, following the two <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/23817"><i>Sky City</i></a> EPs. Two more Varg2™ releases are due out before the end of the year: a collaboration with Croatian Amor on Posh Isolation, and an hour-long tape made with Ano Ton. <br/><br/>Listen to "Thirst (Dressed In Nothing But UV Paint And Biodegradable Glitter)."</p>
