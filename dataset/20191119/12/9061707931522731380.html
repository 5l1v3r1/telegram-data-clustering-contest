      <h1>Hits and misses - Derby County's last five January transfer windows</h1>
      <h2>The Rams made two new signings in the January window last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:56:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:56</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Nicholson</a></address>
      <p>Derby County fans are waiting to see how much business the club will do in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Turn the clock back to January this year, and <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county?GHGGHGGHGGH">Derby</a> added two new faces.</p>
      <p>Manager Frank Lampard brought in his former Chelsea and England team-mate <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-defender-ashley-cole-2682190">Ashley Cole</a> , as well as Leicester City's <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andy-king-reacts-season-ending-2600361">Andy King</a> .</p>
      <p>Cole arrived as a free agent and the 38-year-old made 12 appearances, seven of them starts, including one in the Championship play-off final at Wembley.</p>
      <p>He was released at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>King came in on loan from Leicester until the end of the season, but the midfielder damaged an ankle in only his second start.</p>
      <p>The injury came in the 1-0 defeat by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground in February and ended his season. He had made only four appearances.</p>

      <p>Other recent January signings have also struggled to make a significant mark, Raul Albentosa, Nick Blackman, Kasey Palmer among them.</p>
      <p>Darren Bent made an immediate impact after signing on loan from Aston Villa in January 2015, scoring 12 goals in 17 games. His move was made permanent that summer.</p>
      <p>Cameron Jerome's burst of four goals late in the 2017-18 season helped to fire Derby into the Championship play-offs, while David Nugent, who joined the Rams in January 2017, went on to score 17 goals in 85 league games.</p>
      <p>Other January signings, Abdoul Camara and Julian de Sart, found themselves in and out of the team while none of the 13 players who arrived at Derby in the last five January windows are still with the club.</p>
