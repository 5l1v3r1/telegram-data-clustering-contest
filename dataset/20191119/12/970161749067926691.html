      <p>Congratulations are in order for Chloe Goodman and Grant Hall – the couple are expecting their first child together.</p>
      <p>Chloe, 26, confirmed her pregnancy as she told Closer magazine that she’s always wanted to have a baby: ‘I’ve wanted to be a mum for years.</p>
      <p>‘I’m from a family of five girls and I’ve always had maternal instincts. When I met Grant, we agreed early on that we wanted to become parents, so it feels like everything has fallen into place.’</p>
      <p>Chloe, who found fame on Ex On The Beach in 2014, which was followed by a stint on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/celebrity-big-brother/">Celebrity Big Brother</a> in 2015, has been hard at work preparing for the new arrival.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘Now that I’ve passed the three-month mark, I’ve completely dived into being pregnant.</p>
      <p>‘We started the nursery, then Grant decided he wanted to renovate the whole house so it’s perfect and to make it baby friendly.’</p>

      <p>The pregnancy hasn’t been entirely stress-free for Chloe and her Queen’s Park Rangers footballer beau – she revealed that treatment following an abnormal smear test result means she may not carry to full term.</p>

      <p>Chloe had part of her cervix removed to get rid of the pre-cancerous cells, and explained: ‘I knew I needed to get rid of the abnormal cells and have the op, but it was stressful because I worried I wouldn’t be able to carry a child full-term.</p>
      <p>‘It sparked me into trying sooner to give myself the best chance. There’s a plan in action and I’m being monitored.’</p>
      <p>She added that she is avoiding any strenuous activity before she has a meeting with her consultant in December and a stitch put in her cervix to stop her going into labour early.</p>

      <p>The couple are now planning to have a lavish gender reveal party on New Year’s Eve to celebrate the upcoming arrival in 2020.</p>
