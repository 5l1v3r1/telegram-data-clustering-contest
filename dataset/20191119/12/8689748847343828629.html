      <p>Ghanaian movie producer, Kofi Asamoah has cautioned Ghanaian singer, Famaye to be careful about his utterances which seems to be creating a bad image for himself.</p>
      <p>According to Kofi Asamoah, Fameye will be doing himself a very big favour if he works on his temperament and communication skills since it goes a long way to sustain a brand with these qualities.</p>
      <p><b>“Fameye should be careful about how he carries himself, he should be careful about his communication skills and his temperament,”</b> the CEO of KOFAS Media said on Zylofon FM’s ‘Showbiz Agenda’ with host Sammy Flex.</p>
      <p>Addressing issues relating to Awal’s claims that Fameye failed to show up for the shooting of a music video after he had made an initial deposit of GHC500 to cover his cost of transportation to the location, Kofi Asamoah also noted that since Famaye is new in the music industry, he should avoid having such issues with others in the industry.</p>
      <p><b>“One thing that sometimes we take for granted is a verbal agreement. People think others cannot take them on because an agreement was verbal but that’s not true. Even text messages are forms of agreement and Verbal agreement is a form of contract,”</b> he added.</p>
