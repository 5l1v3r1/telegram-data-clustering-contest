          </p>
          <p>With second spot still up for grabs in Group E of the Euro 2020 Qualifying Round and today’s opponents both in with a chance of moving into that berth, this encounter between Wales and Hungary has all the ingredients in place of being a humdinger of a contest. This match is bound to be an intoxicating brew as the gripping narrative of qualification looms over this encounter for both the sides.</p>
          <p>As either side looks to wrap up what has been a testing, gruelling and tedious set of clashes in the qualification for it by sealing qualification, this will be a match either side comes hot out of the blocks. Separated by just the singular point in second and third place respectively ahead of this culminating encounter, Hungary and Wales will come out hungry for a win in this one.</p>

                <p>Currently in second place, Hungary hold a slight advantage over Wales with the side knowing that even a draw would end up doing the job for them. The side sit on the cusp of qualification, having garnered up 12 points with the four wins from seven matches. Elsewhere, Wales are snapping right at their heels with 11 points, having defeated Azerbaijan 2-0 in their previous match, an opponent Hungary put down as well in their foregone tie with a 1-0 win in their kitty from that contest.</p>

                            <h3>WAL vs HUN Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Guilty of going to sleep and falling apart in defence, Hungary know they can’t afford to fallout in this encounter if they are to come out of this one with a favourable result in their artillery. The side will be turning to their dependable safeguard in the form of their goal-keeper, Peter Gulacsi to parry away the slew of shots he’s bound to face today, seeing him come into our side owing to the save points he promises to rope in for us.</p>
                            <h3>WAL vs HUN Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Having conceded just six times in seven matches, Wales will be banking on their compact, disciplined, cohesive and stringent defence to imbed in place a cleansheet today and allow their forward moving players to keep battering the opposition without any qualms. This is going to be an extremely closely contested affair, a match where we envisage Wales to come out unscathed, seeing us move in with a magnitude of defenders from their side for this one.</p>
                            <p>We begin with Tottenham’s Ben Davies with the player offering pristine value owing to the attacking traits he offers as a player alongside his defensive duties. The player is someone who persistently keeps moving down the park with his astute and articulate acumen of passing and crossing making him likely layup the ball perfectly for his counterparts. </p>
                            <p>Connor Roberts will be assisting him today as we opt for the pair of fullbacks from the side while from the other side of the segment we have decide to indulge in the services of Gergo Lovrencsis.</p>
                            <h3>WAL vs HUN Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Ahead of this round of qualifiers, Gareth Bale was blatant in talking about how he preferred playing for Wales in comparison to Real Madrid. It was not just a documentation of how the player is looking forward to doling out his skill set for his country but also a clear swipe at a club who has treated him shambolically and persistently tried to force through his exit.</p>
                            <p>He comes bearing a very big goal threat today, seeing him come into our side for this one alongside David James whose succulent and resplendent displays in this round of the qualifiers have seen h grow him stature to become a staunch player for the side. From Hungary elsewhere we have selected Balazs Dzsudzsak and Dominiik Szoboszlai, two players who’ll be eying up fathoming together a goal for the side today.</p>
                            <h3>WAL vs HUN Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>Although Hungary themselves have found it tough to string together a hoard of goals, Wales’ need to score themselves today will open up the park for Hungary. With Wales bound to persistently move forward as they search for the elusive goal which ascertains them of qualification, Hungary will be allowed to exploit the spaces they find, a discourse which the side is set to capitalise on.</p>
                            <p>It sees us get in the indomitable partnership of Roland Sallai and Adam Szalai from the team while from the other side we are venturing in with Kieffer Moore as our singular choice.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Szalai will represent us as our captain for the day with Bale from the other side being opted for as the vice-captain.</p>
