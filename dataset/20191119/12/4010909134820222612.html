      <p>In just a few hours ago, it was announced that<b> Valve</b>'s <b>Half-Life</b> is getting a new title but it's not the 3rd sequel, rather the company's long-awaited "flagship VR game" which will be unveiled on 21 November (#soon!). <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rumour-valve-are-about-to-announce-a-vr-game-called-half-life-alyx/">It was confirmed</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">Valve's Twitter account</a> and officially titled as <b>Half-Life: Alyx</b>. The game will also make its way at The Game Awards on 12 December 2019.</p>
      <p>It started as a rumour first from the same leaker that spread the rumour on DotA Underlords. From the transcript, the conversation between Geoff Keighley, Robin Walker and an anonymous read out "March 2020, Half-Life: Alyx" in regarding if the game would be available without needing a VR. While Geoff didn't say yes nor no, the anonymous expressed that they "would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard". I'm sure most of us would love that too, but let's not get our hopes too high as the trio also mentioned that "it began as an exploration of VR".</p>
      <p>Besides from the official announcement, there was nothing else on the gameplay mechanic. We have some ideas on how it might play out since it's VR, so it will definitely be a first-person shooter type of game. Another clue from the transcript also reads "You can see their whole body-- Respond to the situation. You know, panicking, dropping clips on the ground as they fumble their weapons 'cause a zombie's in front of them, all these things, they're just - it's been really fun watching playtests".</p>

      <p>For those who have never played Half-Life before (how could you?), Alyx is one of Gordon Freeman's closest allies during the second chapter and, interestingly, Valve is picking this character to continue. Would the story be canon? Time will tell, so until then, we expect to see more information about Half-Life: Alyx this week.</p>
