      <p>If you want to buy the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/wearables/best-smart-watches-what-s-the-best-wearable-tech-for-you-1154074">best smartwatch</a> you can now get it for less than ever before as Samsung has just kicked off its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/wearables/best-smart-watches-what-s-the-best-wearable-tech-for-you-1154074">Black Friday sale</a> and the most tempting deal is by far the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/samsung-galaxy-watch-review">Galaxy Watch</a>.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch was released in late 2018, and instantly jumped in at the top of TechRadar's ranking of the best smartwatches. It cost £279 at the time for a 42mm model with Bluetooth, and has kept its price surprisingly well, which is why it's so shocking that Samsung has knocked £100 off the price.</p>
      <p>Now, you can buy the device for £179 for that aforementioned configuration, and it's £100 cheaper for the 46mm models as well as LTE devices. Not all retailers are selling the Galaxy Watch in all its different versions though, so you'll have to shop around to find a particular configuration.</p>
