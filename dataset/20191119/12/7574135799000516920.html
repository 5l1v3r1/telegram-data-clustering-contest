      <p>The <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/phife-dawg-rip/">late</a> <b>A Tribe Called Quest</b> member <b>Phife Dawg</b> would have turned 49 tomorrow (November 20), and in honor of his birthday, frequent Tribe collaborator <b>Consequence</b> has shared a previously unreleased song that he recorded with Phife around the time they were working on the final Tribe album, 2016’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/brooklynvegans-top-albums-of-2016/"><i>We got it from Here… Thank You 4 Your Service</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“I always knew I wanted people to hear this record, but it just felt like the timing had to be right,” Cons told <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/a-tribe-called-quest-phife-dawg-featured-on-new-consequence-song-listen/">Pitchfork</a>. “This year it feels right. The one thing I know about Phife is that he’s a rapper’s rapper. The best gift I could give him for his birthday this year is to let the world hear the ‘5 Foot Assassin’ once again!”</p>
      <p>The song is called “No Place Like Home” and it’s a soulful mid-tempo jam that’s just about as good as anything on that final Tribe album. It was produced by Consequence and Mike Cash, with additional production from Fede Vindver and Rich Keller. Listen below.</p>
