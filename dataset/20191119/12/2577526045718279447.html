      <h1>CS:GO's New Update Introduces Fortnite-Style Skins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:30:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Valve had a busy night last night. As well as a certain <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/19/valve-announces-new-half-life-game">virtual reality announcement</a>, the developer unveiled Operation Shattered Web for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, introducing actual characters to the game for the first time.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="http://counter-strike.net/shatteredweb">announcement</a> last night, Valve confirmed that Operation Shattered Web will allow players to “unlock all-new T and CT-sided characters on any map.” Available as mission rewards, those new models don’t offer anything when it comes to gameplay, but provide a new look, and - in the most expensive cases - new voice lines and animations. A bit like a grittier take on a <i>Fortnite</i> skin.</p>
      <p>Speaking of <i>Fortnite</i>, Shattered Web also comes with a battle pass, which you’ll level up with stars earned by completing weekly missions, and which offer new cosmetics. It also introduces “end-of-match accolades” - instead of focusing down on KDA, accolades will give players the nod for everything from ‘most assists’ to ‘most chickens massacred’.</p>
      <p>Of course, this wouldn’t be a Counter-Strike update without a host of new weapon skins, which are present in impressive numbers in Shattered Web. There are also new maps, although they’re limited to non-traditional modes like Flying Scoutsman and Danger Zone.</p>
