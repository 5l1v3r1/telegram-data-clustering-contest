      <p>The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) handed a five-year ban, of which two were suspended, and a hefty fine of three lakh Taka ($3,540) to former Test cricketer Shahadat Hossain for assaulting teammate Arafat Sunny during the ongoing National Cricket League.</p>
      <p>The incident took place during the match between the Dhaka Division and Khulna Division at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The officials in charge of the contest reported Shahadat’s informal on-pitch behaviour after the pacer was seen slapping and kicking his teammate during the match.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the fight started after a heated argument between the two over how to shine the ball.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh’s cricket body confirmed that the 33-year-old has admitted to the charges against him.</p>
      <p>“Considering his past behaviour we decided to punish him for five years. The last two years of his ban will remain suspended,” BCB’s technical committee chief Minhajul Abedin was quoted as saying by <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>Hossain played 38 appearances for Bangladesh in the longest format of the game.</p>
      <p>The cricketer also served two months of detention in 2015 after he and his wife were accused of torturing an 11-year-old girl, whom they had employed as domestic help. However, the couple was cleared of the accusations when it went to trial.</p>
      <p>Hossain was embroiled in another controversy in 2018 when news emerged that the cricketer had assaulted a rickshaw driver for bumping into his vehicle in Dhaka.</p>
