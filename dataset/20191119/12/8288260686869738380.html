      <p>Baffled This Morning fans have taken to social media - and they're all asking the same question: "where's Phil?"</p>
      <p>Every morning, from Monday to Thursday, Phillip Schofield presents the ITV1 daytime favourite with Holly Willoughby.</p>
      <p>But today, fans of the show flocked to social media to have their say after a segment of the show left them puzzled.</p>
      <p>Baffled viewers were quick to address one scene - after eagle-eyed fans spotted Phil's disappearing act.</p>
      <p>The silver-haired presenter was missing from a key segment, forcing Holly, 38, to present alone.</p>

      <p>The Liverpool Echo, our sister title, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-morning-viewers-left-asking-17280256">reports</a> the 57-year-old was absent from a fashion item which saw Trinny Woodall talk through the best ways to 'power dress'.</p>
      <p>There was an empty seat next to Holly as Phil was nowhere to be seen and fans of the ITV daytime show were quick to notice.</p>
      <p>One viewer, taking to Twitter, wrote:: " Phil pulled a disappearing act."</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>A second, meanwhile, chipped in with " Wait where did @schofe go?"</p>
      <p>" Is Phill locked in the loo?" a third asked, while a fourth was left questioning " Where has @Schofe gone?!?"</p>
      <p>After the segment, Holly sent This Morning to an advert break and when they returned Phil was back by her side with no explanation as to where he had been.</p>
