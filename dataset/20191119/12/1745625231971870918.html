      <p>After there being speculation of <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/halsey">Halsey</a> being pregnant with her new boyfriend Evan Peters, the “Bad at Love” hitmaker took to Twitter to shut down the rumors, per <a href="http://www.music-news.com/news/UK/126423/Halsey-shuts-down-pregnancy-speculation"><i>Music News</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“Still not pregnant. Still just allergic to gluten. Still love pancakes,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>“Is it a boy? Is it a girl? It’s pancakes,” the “Now or Never” songstress continued.</p>
      <p>Her followers took to the platform to join in on the joke.</p>
      <p>“Congrats on the pancakes,” one user wrote.</p>
      <p>“Ok but what kind of pancakes,” another shared.</p>
      <p>“Are you trying to tell us they are gonna be Pansexual? Ok I’ll stop lmao,” a third fan tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Is it vanilla? Is it chocolate? Is it strawberry? Is it pumpkin chocolate chip flavor?” a fourth user questioned.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5750106/halsey-pregnant-belly-rub/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, it all started when Peters rubbed her stomach when the pair were seen out in public in California. Halsey wore a loose-fitted one-piece which led for fans and publications to believe she may be expecting her first child and that she was trying to cover up her bump.</p>
      <p>The duo made their red carpet debut on October 26 at the party for <i>American Horror Story</i>‘s 100th episode. They dressed up as Sonny and Cher, wearing matching garments. Halsey stunned in an off-the-shoulder polka dot dress and Evan wore a shirt with the exact same design, per <a href="https://www.accessonline.com/articles/evan-peters-and-halsey-couple-up-as-sonny-and-cher-to-make-romance-red-carpet-official"><i>Access Online</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Halsey recently split with British musician Yungblud and spoke about their separation on Twitter to clear things up with her fans.</p>

      <p>“Sometimes. People just break up. It doesn’t mean someone cheated or something bad happened or someone f-ed up. Sometimes. It just happens,” she informed everyone, which implied they didn’t end on bad terms.</p>

      <p>It hasn’t been revealed when they first split but Halsey and Evan were first seen holding hands in late September at the Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park in California.</p>
      <p>For Halloween, the “Without Me” chart-topper and Peters couple dressed up again. Halsey nailed a Marilyn Manson look with an orange wig, heavy face makeup, and eye contacts. She rocked a white long-sleeved skin-tight PVC leotard paired with fishnet tights and thigh-high boots. Evan, on the other hand, went as Violent J of the Insane Clown Posse and wore a jumper with the band’s initials on it. He emulated the look of the cartoon on his sleeve.</p>
